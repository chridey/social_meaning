i still have my original vinyl lp with that great Doris Day cover !
She was still the best thing on screen, but she lacked subtlety as an actress.
All three of the people that Day, Cagney, and Mitchell portray were still alive at the time that Love Me or Leave me was being filmed.
First thing I can't help but notice is that the camera and lighting work is about as good as your typical soap opera, and sometimes won't even sit still.
Tho Cagney is accused of attempted murder, you still feel sorry for him, and glad that Day will sing to promote his new night club.
Day sing the title song "Love Me or Leave Me" and "Ten Cents a Dance" and it still sounds modern today.
Doris Day's portrayed Ruth as a sexy and sassy performer and sung with a strong, jazzy, bluesy voice, when I saw the real Ruth perform in the movies and in 2 shorts, she wasn't sexy and sassy, she was reserved, the type of performer to stand still and sing with great emotion and feeling, she wasn't the wiggling hips type like Doris Day portrayed and Ruth's voice was so light, airy, powerful without being loud and aggressive, you don't hear the blues, jazz in Ruth's voice yet she was a torch singer.
If you're still in doubt after seeing this film, watch "Julie" sometime.
But obviously the potion rescues Madeline from a broken neck, and she is still walking, with her head twisted backwards.
Towards the end, Ernest can't handle being with either of them, and after they co-operate, and Ernest finally dies (naturally), it ends with them finally falling apart, but Madeline still gets a good final line.
Also, the use of film manipulation and special effects is excellent for its' time in this movie, and is still easily appreciated even now.
Whether we interpret it as a jab at Hollywood (and movie stars' obsessions with their looks) or as plain old wacky fun, it's still something else.
The cast bring their unpeccable goods despite all the visual effects (which still after 14 years look amazing).
What is even still surprising in Death Becomes Her is that there are real motives behind all the actions.
I have seen this movie at least a dozen times and still find things to laugh at.
But still to this day, I really enjoy watching Death Becomes Her.
Madeline's career on Broadway ends, and 14 years later she is still struggling with her fading looks and bygone acting career.
Ernest kills Madeline, Madeline is still aliveÂ Madeline kills HelenÂ Helen is still aliveÂ death has become them.
But still this is one of those films that for some reason keeps me watching it every time it pops up on TV.
A simple premise presides: Madeline Ashton (Streep), a fading B-movie actress, relegated to performing an awful musical based on SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH, sets sight on renown surgeon Ernest Manville (Bruce Willis) whom Helen Sharp (Hawn) has taken to meet her as a test to prove he will still be hers after their meet.
Casting these three actors are cast against type works in this edgy comedy, and if anything, it's final act is its own weakness, as if the writers had somehow not known where to go with the inevitable, violent encounter between them but all in all, it's still very enjoyable.
We don't need to see her sitting in front of her shrine of hatred for Madeline - we know she hates her, it's quite clear - so he should have held that scene perfectly still, allowing us to see Streep get closer and closer to the forefront.
It only resembles the comics in the visuals (which, by the way, still borrows a whole lot from Jeunet), but the plot takes the characters and gives them a 360 degrees rotation (if, in the comics, Ofelia ever kissed Mortadelo, instead of feeling pleased his reaction would be more like puking).
Dr. Kravaal (played by Karloff, of course, in still another of his overly ardent scientist roles) is remarkably brought back to life, and begins his scientific pursuits anew.
The goateed Kravaal, likable at first, grows increasingly deranged as the film progresses, but still manages to hold the audience's sympathies; a brilliant scientist using unethical methods to achieve great ends.
Unlike the mad science of Frankenstein, these Karloff Columbia Pictures grounded their stories in a modern setting, despite how outrageous the experiments might seem, often they still offer a realism, debating how far one should go to increase life expectancy.
Lynch captures a vampire that is cultured, charismatic, vulnerable, and still human.
Rarer still one that was produced for the small screen.
For a first movie by the young director one can only say "great" even if he were an old hand it would still be a great thriller and one that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
But kudos go to the magnificent Helen Hayes as the new addition to the family who stands up to Hale, John Beal, as her sensitive nephew who falls in love with her, and Robert Montgomery playing Hayes' husband, still under the control of his mother.
He goes into town and "buys" a wife (Loretta Young), whom he treats with respect (he's a gentleman) but also quite aloofly (he's still deeply in love with his dearly departed wife and is not ready to move on).
In actuality she was a decade older and she wasn't fooling anyone--but still a lovely woman regardless of the age difference.
this triggers a battle of wills to win the heart of RachelÂand just to add to their problems the film is set against a backdrop of continuing raids by rogue Shawnee Indians on the local homesteads.This is truly a forgotten western classic that still feels very fresh today,Rachel and the Stranger is very very charming film,that is also very funny and has a simple but intelligent script,on top of that add three truly Epic performances by the three leads and an action packed finale and you have a wonderful film.
Sometimes they can be distracting (for example, you lose the illusion that a movie should create and instead you get the feeling that there are production people behind the camera) but still, the story and some of the characters depictions are so strong that you are still left with a haunting and depressing feeling long after the end credits.
But somehow you still feel for them.
throughout the movie we see that even though the Jesuits could communicate with the Natives and vice versa there was still a great amount of misunderstanding.
Beresford creates a very bleak atmosphere, using the cold Quebec landscape as an intimidating, but still beautiful backdrop.
Days later imagery is still flooding back to you -- feelings -- ideas -- and of course questions...
It still has that effect.
The rights and wrongs, the pros and cons, of the cultural collision of Europeans with the autochthonous peoples are still too contentious, so I would rather not get into them.
The verbal, clever, British material is still going strong, immensely so, and this holds numerous of the greatest lines of the franchise.
Blackadder is cynical and grumpy as usual, Baldrick is his stupid self and George is still very stupid and positive in this terrible war.
The movie however is quite short and it didn't feel that the movie covered the entire story and the ending is abrupt and not entirely satisfying because it still leaves a bunch of questions unanswered.
Rowan Atkinson is at the top of his game as the uber-cynical Blackadder still reeling from the shock of having gone from fighting colonial wars to fighting the much more heavily armed Germans.
Yes some of the slapstick tomfoolery is still there, mainly at the expense of poor gormless Private Baldrick.
You come to see some extreme situations that she is going through (some of them almost suicidal or might drive one crazy) in the belief that her son is still alive and that there is a way of getting him back.
Therefore I now look to Asia for my horror because thankfully they still understand that while the genre must progress, it must also still scare.
After saying this, even though in my mind this is possibly the best haunted house film I've ever seen it is still just that, meaning do not expect to watch this film and see it completely redefine horror because it doesn't.
And now, "The Orphanage," from acclaimed Spanish producer Guillermo del Toro, creeps its way into their ranks, while still being a genre-defying film.
Each scene is so elegant that it can be incredibly terrifying while still being gorgeously shot at the same time.
But with all that aside, "The Orphanage" is still a classy and mysterious haunted house movie that will keep you guessing (and screaming) until the end.
I'm not a hardcore horror movies fan, but I still enjoy watching one or two when there's something interesting to watch.
Bottom line: even if you don't like "scary" movies (like me), you'll probably still appreciate and enjoy the more thrilling aspects.
Either way, it's still worth seeing - the exploration of Laura's heart and mind are both lovely and tragic to behold, and though the film is morbid, it is beautiful as well.
However, The Orphanage still stands up as a strong piece of work.
Like ALUCARDA, the film doesn't dwell on period reconstruction (and, in fact, we only realize when the story actually takes place via a reference towards the end to the Inquisition); still, a few social/racial issues are raised nonetheless with the presence of the two black nuns/maids, who are mistreated even by their white 'colleagues'!
re-appearing to offer her the post of Mother Superior at the convent (the girl having conveniently murdered the current one), whereupon she discovers that her colleagues have been possessed as well, though they still end up killing her!
While some parts are a little silly and cheesy, and there are still goofs this makes for a nice movie to watch and keep in the collection one you could watch over and over and still be able to laugh.
This is one of those flicks that have too many flaws and no plot whatsoever but it's still impossible not to like them, for some imprecise cause.
Overall I found this to be an amusing film but still it's a touch on the "light" side, a little more black humor could have made it a bit better.
"If they move, kill them" is a running joke through the film as the number of hostages increases and, whether or not a deliberate reference to Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, its still funny.
The events take place at noon at night and the movie still looks sinister.
And that's really the magic of Night Gallery - being able to scare you but still having a solid story to do it with.
Today, 40 years later I still think about it and check to see if the spot is still there.
I was 16 when Then Came Bronson was broadcast, but I still vividly remember moments from 6 or 7 of the episodes.
I'm still trying to figure what it is they are doing in the first one!
I used to watch this show as a young teenager every week and now I'm watching it every week as a young adult and I'm still loving it.
And i know i will still love it after 10 or 20 years.
they only just recently opened a new one across from the Public toilets, the old bank   they only got Bendigo bank now , the Pub that they used has now Been Reopened was closed for a while, they only had one pub for awile down near Primary school end great people there nice lunches the emppty Bakery still there, the supermarkets still there, the chemists still there, most hasn't changed they still use the football Ground minyip-Murtoa alternate games between Minyip & Murtoa got a lot of friends both places   i remember going into the Milk Bar where i met Viki Blanch she was nice some talk to you for a while especially when their between shots
Brought into the mix of all these characters is a charming bootlegger (prohibition was still the law of the land) played by Ben Lyon.
Gary is a kid from a decent background and a home in Connecticut who has chosen to postpone going to college in order to "discover himself"; Chay is a more freewheeling type who just wants to experience the here-and-now while she is still young.
An admittedly passÃ©, but still intriguing period piece.
The uncertainty of the incident and her disbelief nurture in us the hope, however meagre, that somehow or other he is still alive.
The following year she was trying to get on with her life, still denying her husband's death.
The portrayal of MariÃ© by Charlotte Rampling is inspiring that such a high level of acting could be protrude on film still.
In several scenes is shown that Marie still talks to her husband in the present tense, like he's only gone for a couple of days but will return very quickly.
In that scene, we see again that she just can't accept it because the body that is found has all the characteristics of her missing husband, but she still denies that it is her husband.
Even as Marie tries to accept a new lover but struggles, because her husband is still very much with her.
Above all, she is acting as though Jean is still alive and well.
Months later, while Jean is never found, we see Marie reacting as though he still exists.
...and its still one of my favorites.
This film may have been better if it was handled by someone like David Lynch, but despite its imperfections; Of Unknown Origin is still worth seeing.
But even still, this movie was all about Jason Stewart.
Why the interrogators asked the same questions and were given the same answers to them still eludes me as they could have made the questioning reflect the person who was being question.
Well, it IS an interesting premise, that the U.S. domestic response to 9/11 has brought the country closer in some respects to the police states it still publicly condemns.
For those who still are not convinced, think about it in a practical way.
If it ever became known that the FBI tortured people to obtain information, do you think any of those people would still have jobs?
If we are truly the most humane and democratic country in the world, if due process is still alive, then we must show it, not just say it.
Predator is infused with elements of sci-fi, horror, and action adventure and primarily is the sole reason why it is still a beloved among hard-core action fans.
The special effects at that time were top notch and well deserved of the Oscar nomination and even today it still has the contemporary look and feel.
Well done to be sure but still material we have all seen before.
An Action Sci-fi movie with action scenes that are believable (humanly possible) but still with a mysterious, powerful alien that is slowly developed from a computer generated wispy creature to a real and frightening being.
In summary, a fast, innovative Action Sci-fi movie so full with small detail that you can see it time after time and still discover something new.
It still stands (along with, yes, the Alien) as one of the coolest and most imaginative monsters ever put on film.
The title character of the film is still cool and frightening by todays standards.
As we watch the downfall of summer "popcorn" movies, its good to know we can still go back and watch something great like this film.
In 1987, Arnold Schwarzenegger was solidifying his position as an action superstar with the releases of the epic Conan, the influential Terminator and the somewhat mediocre Commando that was still fun to watch anyway.
And I'm still wondering how that managed to do that in 1987.
Film also benefits from being made in that 80s early 90s era where your action film could take its self seriously yet still not too seriously.
Again, not the most intelligent film ever made, but `Predator' is still quite good - it's probably Schwarzenegger's best pure action movie.
This is obviously the best of the Predator movies and still one of the most highly liked thrillers today.
The one thing that still astonishes me to this day, 16 years later, is indeed the Predator.
I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame.
I mean, he was still like-able as a character despite the things he did.
Of course this problem has gotten better in recent years (and I'll happily give the credit to HBO), but still producers are too afraid to alienate their audience.
The Desperate Housewives still live close by and Vince Chase still has his Entourage.
I'v watched the TV show Hex twice over and I still can not get enough of it.
I would still like to now if Ella finally gets her revenge and her and Leon finally get to have a normal relationship.
But it is still a great film.
I still get my mailbox money from my music days--we had a lot of fun and I'll always be grateful for the recording and tours.
found this film i was imediatly drawn away by the tag line "Mr Pink makes a movie" it still makes me shiver today.
Lars vTrier is a genius,no doubt.Everything he did,especially The Kingdom is extraordinary and very very good,shocking..but there is something that makes me feel humiliated.In Epidemic this feeling comes to its peak.It is like 'you stupid audience,watch whatever I do with your open mouth where I can put everything I want,it can be a candy or ..it'.The first I saw from him was 'Breaking the Waves' that impressed me so much that I begun waiting for the next work of the director.That was 'Dancer in the Dark'and I became a child who ate a chocolate bonbon(Danser in the Dark) after a caramelized bonbon(Breaking the Waves).In the meanwhile I found the opportunity to see Riget on the TV,this was a box filled with chocolate candies filled with caramel.Even though,all those candies were taken with no finishing,I was still a child with wide open mouth.And then 'dogville'came.Another big different candy.
After finishing 'Epidemic',I felt as if I've just eaten a big piece of ..it.Very much experimental,very much B&W,very much LvT,...But I am still with my wide open mouth,waiting to eat 'Mandelay'.it is worth risking!
I have probably seen it with my daughter at least 6 times, but I still laugh at sight gags and funny lines and continue to find it hilariously funny how sexy Vanessa Williams' character is especially for a pre-school kid's movie!
Even if my son watches it back to back, he's still captivated by it.
The film lacks in fully understanding the ethnic peoples of the region, however it still is groundbreaking in its non-simplistic 'gray' portrayal of the war rather than other films that depict the combatants as 'good' or 'evil.'
It is unfortunate that Savior was not made before 1995, while the Bosnian War was still being fought, it would have definitely helped to open viewers' eyes to the reality of the war.
A tale played out over and over in human history, yet we still have not learned our lesson.
Most of the parts that I visited were still in shambles, with almost every structure in ruins.
The cinematics - beautiful scenery etc (to show that man really has no sense at all - he can be surrounded by some of the most amazingly beautiful surroundings and still turn the place to hell) and sound (the gunshots / ambient stuff etc were very well done) were all spot on..  For the actual plot, the other comments posted are a lot more lucid than mine, so I won't bother trying to explain the premise of this flick.
The Turkish, the Byzantine and the Hapsbugh empires have all disappeared into the sands of time and these poor fools were convinced that this was still a war worth fighting?
The last 15 to 20 minutes are sure to move even the cold hearted so,I am surprised and saddened that there are still some folks here at the forum fighting over its anti/pro Muslim/Serbian credentials.
Although the thrills I got from playing its predecessors were a bit absent, I still got a good time playing TT.
You may still wield two weapons, but now the choice of the other one... sword, mace, dagger or axe... affects the way you do so, in the range, force, etc.
There are still many different ones within those four kinds.
The Free Form Fighting System is also still in use, so spamming powerful attacks is still possible, however, this comes closer to The Sands of Time in the combat, with more strategy and tactics necessary, among other things because of those archers... arrows in general are present in this, and they are very welcome.
The puzzles are still well-done, and this can be challenging, and should satisfy a decent range of people, with three difficulty settings.
The regular prince is still effective to at what he does and fighting and stealth kills are his thing too.
Even still, I decided to give Prince of Persia a shot.
The scenes which I think are 'real' in opposition to 'dreamt' ones, mainly show the hero, with his unfortunate friends, but still happy singing beautiful harmonies.
With so many animations that are faltering in great humour (I rarely laugh out loud the Simpsons, Family Guy or American Dad any more - South Park still does the business from time to time) This show had me laughing really hard a few times per episode.
An interesting British entry to say the least dating from those dim dark days when William Hartnell was still 'Billy' but at least got a credit unlike Bernard Miles.
But it still sounds just wrong!
I've read so many bad reviews about this movie that it's a wonder I still went to see it.
I give an 8 only to movies that still make me think about them the next day; and when I feel that I have to recommend them to others in the confidence that they will like it too.
Conway gets the money, holds them (but not the check) and rewinds the time, and then cashes the check again, still holding the money for the first time.
That is she should still be wounded after the time jump.
Worse still though is the behaviour of the police.
If you liked Millennium you will like this, not up to a Stargate, but still a nice plot.
The time travel concept doesn't altogether add up and there is one sequence which still doesn't make any sense to me but this is science fiction and how many action films make much sense anyway?
Belial looks totally different in this film too, and he still looks ridiculous.
This time Gabe Bartalos give "tru life" to Belial, using an animatronic model instead of a still one animated in stop motion!
Is still great movie.
Kevin Van Hentenryck is still as horrible as ever before in his acting but they cleverly resolved this by putting in way more characters this time, so the entire focus of the movie this time isn't just upon Duane and Belial.
The story is of course silly but it also still is a notch up when compared to the first movie.
Not a faithful adaptation of Heinlein's book but still a good film in its own right.
His father agrees, even if he still does not think he has a place for his son.
Maybe I've seen it over five times, and still I cry each time when Federico Luppi stands on the balcony talking about the desperation of life after the idea of loosing his son misunderstood.
This is still, a timeless story about about the devastating effects of a divorce.
I read and still re-read, the book and must agree with other commentators; the film is NOT the book or even reasonably "based on" the book.
Got it again on a battered old VHS and it is still as great.
I'm still waiting.
), so much so that I went out and bought the S/T, which I still listen to (yes kids, on vinyl).
However, he still looked very effeminate.
Though not as bad as "Mom's Got a Date With a Vampire", it was still not worth seeing.
While not explicit, these stories are still lurid enough, photographed in B&W, and used as examples at moral decay with drugs being labeled the culprit.
As it is 2010 now, he still sits in prison and will remain there for quite awhile.
All things considered, I think the case is still extremely circumstantial, and the reasonable doubt is there.
Ceasar plays a wacky WWII patient at the the VA hospital who still believes that the war is still ongoing.
There is still a lot of punching and kicking and throwing of dough, but the plot becomes a lot more serious when the disgruntled bakers sneak some dynamite into the ovens!
While the script remains frustratingly superficial when exploring the film's central romantic triangle, and in spite of its lopsided focus on the tribulations of the one straight male character, Camp still offers many characters and scenes that delight.
The title aside, which may turn many people off the idea of watching the movie, the music is brilliant and after two months since I saw it I still cannot get one of the songs outta my head...Country Plant it's called.
Perhaps Heinlein's time in movies is still to come.
A surer hand on the direction and script could have tightened Camp up considerably, but even as messy as it is, it's still well worth seeing.
This is real evidence for all those who have doubts about Goldie Hawn's talents, since she is delightful from start to finish and once again proves that she was and still is one of the greatest comediennes Hollywood ever produced.
I just finished watching it again after many years and it is still as funny as it was all those years ago.
Will Nick be able to prove his innocence and still get his ex-wife to love him again?
The aliens are suitably creepy as my wife will agree, as she still refuses to watch it again, and it manages without the gore of many similar movies, although it is rather violent.
I still can't believe i spent 10 bucks to buy this crap.
Fortunately, the latter wasn't true for this movie, but it still needed some major work.
Despite the fact that I worked as DP/Camera Op on the film, it was still quite a shock to see the end result and the end result is definitely weird.
And, if he still didn't get the message, they set him up for another mind game and the cartoon ends with that thought in mind.
On the list of werewolf movies, "Big Bad Wolf" ranks pretty low but still manages to stay above "Arizona Werewolf."
I'm still waiting for Abominable to come out here (the Netherlands) on DVD but I decided not to wait with Big Bad Wolf (don't worry, if it does come out, I'll buy it).
Having said all that, there is still plenty of gratuitous nudity, humour and some nice gore.
Maybe not in the same league as the Universal Wolfman, or Brotherhood of the Wolf, it's still way better than most of the recent crop of werewolf flicks.
Also, the ending could have been somewhat better, though it is still perfectly reasonable.
The virgin , the goof ball guy , the insensitive jock and our hero / heroine the slightly off guy and girl who are still California beautiful.
That said, there are still plenty of tense moments along the way as the action unfolds.
But with a pretty solid cast (including Sam Bottoms, Clu Galager, and Ken Swofford), well paced direction, great dialogue, and some juicy gore, it still manages to be a gripping experience.
While all of the original content is mainly still in the game, the game has been revamped and remade with the "Doom 3" engine to run the game.
Although my system is of the high end type, a lot of games still fail at some stage, not Prey.
For Prey is being bunched with the on-going, and oft exhilarating, slew of first person shooters, still in vogue and dominating proceedings, particularly on the PC.
Well, I initially saw this movie because I am a major Carrie fan and I wanted to see another movie with Amy Irving when she was still young.
The cinematography is quite ahead of its time (the camera rarely sits still, yet remains unobtrusive), the drama is milked for maximum effect (and there are numerous sudden shocks), and the science-fiction/occult aspects of the film never overshadow the human element.
Despite the change, the technical credits are still first rate.
But still, I want to say that Williams' score is very good, especially towards the films' climatic moments.
The film gets bloody, but the ending in which Gillian causes the bad guy to explode (using her powers)is still effective (Keep in mind that this was 3 years BEFORE the exploding head scene in "Scanners").
If Mystery Science Theater was still around and lasted for another 15 years, I have no doubt they would've gotten around to screening "The Fury."
The Hong Kong film makers are still the masters of this type of silly action comedy.
If you're still with me, hopefully you see where I'm going with this.
Although the director didn't succeed in making this a better movie, he still shows an affinity for the genre and cannot be dismissed for trying to create a good entertainment.
I wouldn't class it as one of De Palma's best, but still it's far away from his worst.
Thank god the U.K. are still putting out something original.
(If only it wasn't cancelled for a re-run of Who's The Boss) This show is one of the extremely few shows I can watch over and over again, and it still remains funny.
Oh my goodness, ohhhhh yessss) And just the fact it's shot on old 16mm gives the whole show a surreal epic production value to the thing whilst still maintaining the fact it was supposed to be shot on no money in a garage.
I'm hoping people will still buy the DVD (When it comes.
however, i still think they should continue in some way, perhaps a new theme.
still with the same type of humour, still made the same way with the same people, put with a different setting, and characters.
Unlike other shows such as The Mighty Boosh or The League of Gentlemen which spawned mass publicity, cult followings and travelling shows, Garth Marenghi only ran for one series and still survives due to its popularity among the fans.
Like the equally strong but in no way similar Peep Show, Darkplace is a program that can be watched multiple times and still remain as fresh and hilarious as it did first time around, how many American sitcoms can boast that claim?
Darkplace won't appeal to everyone's tastes, but still it looks like it will probably be a cult hit.
The only noted actor in the film was Steiger, and his performance certainly was not his best, but the movie was still very good.
Thru a plot device out of Once Upon A Time in the West, Onion's property is still owned by the orphans of the original farmer who's been killed by Lamb's henchmen.
Miles Goodman adapted the score so I'm giving him credit for this still mega-emotion stirring theme music.
Then, as Ren tells the town "This is our time to dance," well, it still brings a tear of joy and hope.
Although I laughed very much during some of the most gymnastic dance-scenes, I still loved the film.
But this still is the best movie of almost all time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The soundtrack was excellent -- I still remember some of the tunes now.
And even if it's largely to make fun of it, I still love it for old times' sake.
you'll find that there's still a LOT here to enjoy.
"Footloose" makes a few of the mistakes "teen" movies make, but it still kicks up some fun.
But I still respect him (Burns) for trying.
This movie was filmed when practical CG was still a little sketchy.
Certainly, it's no Annie Hall or Manhattan--two pictures that this film seems to aspire to--but it's still worth seeing, especially if you like movies with an improvisational feel.
The dialogue is still good and witty.
and it's all shot with a hand-held camera which is way too jittery and annoying--I realize Burns used it to keep down costs but still...   Absorbing and realistic...well worth catching.
Ben, still pining for Maria, finds a welcome distraction in edgy student/waitress Ashley (Brittany Murphy), who is having an affair with a much older and married dentist, Griffin (Stanley Tucci), whose suspecting wife Annie (Heather Graham), a real estate agent, has her eye on one of her customers, Tommy (back to Ed Burns again), who is (remember?)
The philandering Tucci character, the least sympathetic of the bunch, still manages to drum up some pity, if not sympathy, for his subsequent actions.
It was wonderful of Fran Drescher to open up her spectacular Malibu home to hold a reunion for the much loved,and never forgotten characters of the hit sitcom The Nanny.Although Fran still has that somewhat annoying,thick Queens accent,her appearance has dramatically changed since the Nanny.However,with long straight black hair,and style still in tact,Fran Drescher makes the 40's look fabulous,and was the gracious host for 'A Nosh to Remember' A must-see for all fans of the Nanny.
But it still works wonderfully on its own terms.
I can not think of any better acting for Steven's role as a gay lad who still has to hide from the "bullies" in his school.
I have been out for 10 years and it still hit heart strings that I didn't think existed anymore.
It would still be nice to see some closure to their sweet dating experience and a positive outlook on their individual futures.
**MINOR SPOILERS**   I was glad to see a self-aware young gay character - there still aren't enough, and found the conflicted boyfriend (John) to be quite an interesting character as well - bringing to life (in many scenes) the connections between homophobia, violence, social pressure and generalized lack of self-awareness.
Looking back at this film and when it was released (1999 in the USA) it is startling that the sexual repression that is so prevalent in the film, can still exist in this day and age.
Not quite the same as that where I wasn't dancing with anyone at the time, but the girl I loved and still love was, and we maintained eye contact despite her dancing with someone else.
If it were that easy, I'm sure Brandon Teena would still be alive today.
When you're gay, you can't have both, thanks to the homophobia which still rules athletics with an iron fist.
It paints a picture that doesn't necessarily have a happy ending but still leaves you with a warm feeling inside.
Never mind,still an absolute delight to see after all these years.
Unlike most early (pre-AIDS) gay films, this still hits the spot.
It is a pity if these movies do not follow the course of the original book but still view it as a mills and boon brought to film nonetheless.
And Nicky, well, he's still got it.
So if you've never read the book (I still haven't) and you like Nick... g'wan.
Most of the movie is interviews with participants, including McGovern himself, who still has all the traits that made him attractive 35 years ago, including honesty about his mistakes.
I always wonder when actors turn to films they must know are bad going in, and yet still are part of them!
This movie made a fairly good business at the box, and most of the songs are still fresh in the people's memory.
George McGovern's life and presidential campaign became a catalyst for politics and political movements that are still reverberating to this day.
The film, though, with all it's might, tries to make us believe that, yes, they can still maintain a loving relationship despite all the certain trials that lie ahead.
I worried that the my work on my laptop might have suffered but I watched the pig and answered emails even with this diversion I still hated it.
That's what we wanted then, that's what we hoped for in our leaders then, and that's, oddly what we still want so desperately in this perilous world now.
Although McGovern's platform was somewhat vindicated when Nixon's White House was outed by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as the most corrupt administration in American history (with Tricky Dick's resignation soon following), the tragedy of his loss, and his subsequent fade into the background of American history still resonates.
It used to scare the crap outta me when I was young, and even though its not that scary now I still love it.
The first half is still remotely amusing, since the inept dialogs and cheesy massacres supply the film with a handful of chuckles, but then the whole thing gets too stupid to even smile at.
That's painfully true about our own leadership -- it was in 1988 and still is today.
Well, if you're waiting for an answer - still wait.
Their careers are 'done' and they would have nothing to loose, whereas younger musicians still have commercial appeal and they wouldn't want to eat and spit in the same place.
Many folks 60 years old and older may want watch this because many of these musicians interviewed are musicians/singers/songwriters that generation grew up with and may want to know how they're doing these days, be surprised they're still alive, may want to know how they felt about working in the industry in their day, and how their kids turned out when they weren't even home to see them grow up.
It doesn't work, Eve is still a human and she has to live with how the spell as casted.
She is then reminded, however, that the goal is to try your best, not to be the best, and that you can still be a role model and not be perfect.
The overload of sentiment, morals, drama and unfunny comedy almost made me puke but still I didn't got up to look for the remote.
At first Casey is very upset and hates Eve, her doll, for ruining her chance of having her Mum back, but then gradually she gets to know Eve and appreciates her... She even learns that she can't bring back her Mum, she's gone and she has to live with it and love her Dad with all her might, she still has him and needs to appreciate him more too...
But then Eve goes too and both Casey and her Dad are distraught, but they still have each other!
Lohan's character is a young girl who is still stricken by the sudden death of her mother, if though it happened many years ago.
There was a couple of slow scenes but I still will tell my friends to go see it.
I thought they didn't make them like this any more; unfortunately, sometimes they still do.
This movie moved me deeply, and there are times I still think of it fondly.
I still feel like Rosanna truly made a good effort at getting everyone's point of view, opinion (whether it be selfish/shallow/stupid/excellent/wise), and their passion for their art.
More than anything it gave me hope that some artists of the past/present are still trying to make contact and teach those of the present into the future because they care about where the quality of music goes.
It's still a fairly charming movie, with Carmen taking on the role of two different stage performers and Groucho providing zingers.
A interesting movie to be shown to all the governors of all the Republics where death penalty is still in use...  
Kusturica, given a part that begs overacting, never wrings out our emotions, yet shows he possesses true remorse for his actions and a heart kinder still than that of his benefactors.
I am still curious about what happened to Asoka, Karwaki, Devi and the children.
That of course still doesn't stop his brothers, especially the next in line Susima (Ajit Kumar) from continuous plotting his eradication.
The song sequences of the movies now try not to have spatial and time warps and transportations, and for a film back then, it's still a technique (if you will) used to put the romancing characters in far out locales and situations.
This was the first bollywood movie i ever saw, and it's still one of the tops on my list.
But It it is still totally worth watching.
In some sequences the camera cuts like a sword with flashes of residue left lingering both on screen and in the viewer's mind, yet in others following, he uses less shots and still manages to maintain rhythm.
A film such as Asoka cannot be appreciated on a single viewing alone as upon initial contact one is simply bombarded with an onslaught of visual delights, spellbinding sounds and a story that emerges from our past but still reaches into the depths of every man's soul.
The introduction of Derek (Harris), Kelly's pimp, and the potential threat that he carries as a character is only brought into perspective when it is revealed he answers further still to an individual higher up than he is; the son of the leader of this organisation.
Sad to say, Samuel L.Jackson, as cool as he WAS, is now a hack, collecting a paychecheque for any movie that pays him to utter any variation on a sentence that includes the word 'motherfucker,' and sneer every second line of dialogue in that now clichÃ©d semi-yell he trademarked in Pulp Fiction.I saw this movie for FREE and still regret the two hours of my life I will never get back.
Like the best thrillers, there is still enough to keep the audience guessing right to the end.
London to Brighton deserves to be a huge hit, its bold, its brilliant and its British and it proves once again that we have a thriving film industry packed full of talented people that can still give Hollywood a run for it's money.
Ultimately it all falls on Raj's shoulders can he save the business man's daughter, his friends, and the Chief Minister and get still the girl?
He played a young man married to a "widow" in Deewana, an understanding adopted son in Pardes, or a rich NRI kid who still knows his roots in DDLJ.
The book is still worth reading even today.
Even though this might have worked better on stage, it's still far too stiff and and insignificant to make the audience relate to the characters on an emotional level.
She's a smart, sharp, yet somewhat clumsy lady lawyer--being nominated for judgeship--whose career may be hindered by her association with Cummings, the no-goodnik ex-husband still in love with her.
The two are still in love.
It's a fun movie that still makes me laugh no matter how many times I see it.
I saw this movie without English subtitles and still managed to be affected by the story despite just having started to study Korean.
You Are My Sunshine (English title) covers the issue of AIDS as well as prostitution, two topics that are still a little taboo in Korea, as well as much of Asia.
Being an AD&D player for many years now, I was still let down by the rudimentary knowledge the producers seem to have about D&D.
Gaining from five more years of CGI technology advancements, this movie is far superior than the original Dungeons & Dragons, even if still lacking the blockbuster status.
Those unfamiliar with the game will still enjoy it as an action-oriented fantasy movie.
Special effects are about the same quality as the Hercules and Xena TV series, so I was still able to enjoy the movie despite these flaws.
Even with all of the above against it, the movie is still several times better from the theatrical Dungeons & Dragons movie that came before it.
The heroes are also a lot more natural and likable, although still a bit two-dimensional, and the plot is still a bit weak compared to a decently written adventure for D&D, but in comparison with the first film this one is an Oscar nominee.
I think he was still a Fighter, but he had an artifact that did all sorts of things for him.
I still would have preferred to not have Damodar back, but at least he didn't have blue lipstick this time.
Overall, I like the intensity that Bruce Payne brings to his performances, but I still haven't seen a role where he balances that intensity with believability.
I think my ears may still be bleeding.
It's interesting that this film still has a following in Australia.
I decided to watch this again, after reading some of the other comments, and perhaps find a funnier movie than the one I remembered seeing, but it still wasn't there.
All I can say is that this movie and its sequel "They still call me Bruce" are an integral part of any B grade movie night.
It can be goofy sometimes, but it is so ridiculously goofy that you still laugh.
For those who have, I gather that watching this film still can evoke pretty strong emotions.
Owen was still smarting over the disastrous "Darling Lili" that tossed him off the Paramount Lot... Ron looked so strange - was daddy (J. Paul)Getty right about the biz and his abilities?
But I still loved the Red Tent....
Nobile was still alive when this film came out, he would die in 1978 still a figure of controversy.
Granted it doesn't compare to these or other heavily praised list toppers and film behemoths, mainly due to questions of style and cinematic pioneering (or lack thereof as the case may be), it still deserves more than the meagre 500 votes and 6.6. rating it has here.
After all these years Nobile (Peter Finch) is still plagued by guilt, slowly eroding his soul with questions he can't possibly answer.
As great as a film composer he is, he still is not remembered for one of his most haunting compositions in this film.
Somewhat long and overinvolved this is still an engrossing account of an epic Arctic disaster and the heroic rescue attempts that followed.
Forty years after the event his rest is still disturbed by doubts he has about the leadership he exercised.
It is the first and in some ways still the best of Connery's wise old man performances.
Here we have the revolution being "rumored" in Russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman Baron Nikita 'Nikki' Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.).
Some good acting from Eastwood and Bujold elevate this one above mediocrity, but some interest still remains especially since the serial killer plot angle offers some good ideas.
I'm still not sure what these monks do for their community.
Running well over two-and-a-half hours, the film could've easily been cut by half and still held the same level of immersion.
A silence where the still, small voice of God can be heard.
Not anymore now, but I fear it is still a step too big for me.
If you can sit still for the nearly three hours of this film, it's almost guaranteed to bring down your heart rate, maybe make you want to spend more time in the high mountains or in the snow or contemplating spring flowers in some isolated place.
He speaks of blindness and death, describing both as welcome gifts from God, one received, another still to come.
Time has practically stood still for the Hermit/Monks of this Monastery - the Motherhouse of the Carthusian Order - LE GRANDE CHARTREUSE.
It's a fascinating movie if you are able to get into the slow rhythm of the film (if you are still in the movie theater after an hour, you will probably made it to the third hour).
Fruits are served with supermarket produce number stickers still attached, correspondence and bills arrive and managed with a laptop computer (no evidence of an Internet connection), and some of the tools are distinctly modern.
However, the DVD is still very much worth owning for any Madonna fan - her genius for visuals is at its peak during the videos from "Ray of Light," especially in "The Power of Goodbye" and "Frozen."
The video is probably my least favorite but still pleasantly simplistic.
Movie goers maybe a little more jaded now (Me included) but this movie still holds up.
The b-17 segment still is as exciting and creepy as it was when I first saw it.
I liked Sci-fi more as a kid but still think it has its place, and the premise of linked tales in the future is not a bad one.
If I were a girl, would a still enjoy the movie?
I can stay awake through anything, even HobGoblins, this is a great movie for animation lovers, definitely not for kids, but still this was a good animation.
The simple fact that I have bought 3 copies of this time and still own all 3 of them says something about the movie.
Each in itself could even be fleshed out to hour long length, and still be enjoyable.
I still loved the show until Maggie showed up with her bossy attitude.
This show still has a following in reruns.....the websites are a testament to that.
We travel back and forth in time to find about the past and present of the couple, we even find that they still have feeling for each other but it is the dirty political games and the interventionist attitude of the public and the press that forces them to face and brings out the truth about there lives.
Elijah does everything right by staying out of trouble, going to school, etc., and yet he still gets the shaft.
That's a tribute to director Lubin, the film editor(s), and the comedy duo that in 1941 was still fresh and eager to please.
Even the inevitable romantic scenes are well handled without being draggy, (but just what is that over-sized thing perched on Frazee's head-- I'm still wondering.).
While in BUCK PRIVATES their roles are thankfully bigger, they still are in supporting roles--though the studio stuck their names at the top of the credits to capitalize on their success in the last film.
There were several good skits involving the boys and while not their best work, it still is pretty fresh and well worth watching.
Overall, a much better script than the last film but the duo still take a backseat to the action.
Incidentally, I'm amazed to find that some Abbott & Costello fans are still under the mis-impression that they hated each other in real life.
Though Martin and Lewis had beaten them out of the top ten box office in the later years, the are still considered the best.
Anyone who thinks that Bud Abbott wasn't the best straight man in the business should watch the Drill routine and check out how he consistently and skillfully reins in Costello whenever Lou's manic energy takes him too far outside the skit while still allowing him the freedom to employ the ad-libs and improvisations he was famous for.
Abbott and Costello became picture palace luminaries with this still funny but unsophisticated look at Army life.
I taped it (in crappy 6-hour VHS mode) and still have that copy.
But, if you're old enough to still get excited by the two words, `Dale Bozzio', then you are in, my friend.
One thing that still puzzles me is how Jane Birkin got second billing?
I still find new things to enjoy with each viewing.
The psychological complex about "the end" is still in full force.
But it's still an unpredictable, highly enjoyable film, and the scene where Poirot reveals everything is so perfectly done that you'll want to watch it again and again.
The screen version of Agatha Christie's Death On The Nile would be one of the definitive adaptions of the very old fashioned(but still strangely popular) murder mystery genre.
Well worth hunting down and adding to your collection, as it's a very solid entry in a sadly still declining genre.
I still do not understand the point of this movie.
I have seen this twice now and still there are elements which I cannot yet explain, but they're not so important as the things this film gives and has are already visible to me.
He manages to fit a cross country story within two hours of time, while still bringing out personalities of the characters and making sure there are no holes in the plot.
Badly underrated on release and still unfairly under valued even now, 'Midnight Run' is actually class-act film making, the narrative impeccably engineered and the acting uniformly excellent throughout.
9/10 then for 'Midnight Run', because as an exercise in how to develop a movie, to establish characters and plot trajectories, to bring 'em all together in a final wrap up and still leave space for a minor plot twist, it's of textbook quality.
I reckon it has a entertaining storyline, It's not the best film of JLC and JT but I'ts still worth watching.
Director Bridges apparently thought he could drag it out for nearly two hours and still keep our attention.
Not a great film, but still pretty good.
So it still has something for today's TV audience.
The series is not only a truthful rendition of mid-century Denmark from 1929 to 1947, but also a documentation of Danish self-understanding in the 1980'es - at the time of Danmarks Radios broadcasting monopoly Â and the series itself was, and still is, an integral part of the ongoing formation of the national self-understanding (of which we seem to have a LOT!
Even though I found this movie to be a little off I still found it to be pretty interesting and not bad to watch just once.
Now, almost a day later, I still feel its messages and themes rushing through me.
Fine, still 50 additional years IF the Middle East were to run out today.
And these are the reasons why.... And we've ignored all the symptoms...... And all the indicators...... And now with the best will in the world we will probably still have a huge decline, before things can get better, if they ever will......
She starts trying' ta get her mind offa him by getting friendly with some big lug of a hick but then realizes she still loves Cary Grant.
This is a favorite film, starring Cary Grant and Irene Dunne at their absolute goofy best as a divorced couple who can't admit they still love one another.
How many times have we seen this character, and how many times do we wish he were still making movies like this.
I admire performers who can do that, and Grant certainly deserves the reputation he had, and still has.
Lucy wins out in this round (with a little cheating), but there is still 60 days until the Warriner's divorce is finalized and havoc, inevitably, must ensue!
We often dive in feet first and wind up right back where we started only to find the ghosts of the past are still waiting.
Nevertheless Leo McCarey still received an Oscar for his directing of this movie.
This movie doesn't have a terribly complicated plot--a man and woman are divorcing even though down deep they are still in love.
It's a seamless enjoyable romp containing many laugh out loud sequences, and as much as the outcome my never be in doubt, the ending is still a joy to behold.
Of course, the most famous scene is the one in which Irene Dunne, still in love with husband Grant, appears at his society girl's family's estate.
I've seen it at least seven times and I still laugh out loud each and every time.
Even though 'The Awful Truth' may have established a formula for all subsequent screwball comedies, let's face it, it's still rude and crude around the edges.
In one scene, Cary Grant has brought to Irene Dunne's new fiancÃ© the paperwork on a coal mine the divorcing couple still own.
Dean Martin for the first and only time in his career played a villain, a town boss named Alex Flood who still hasn't gotten control of the stagecoach line Jean Simmons runs.
Even the plot is cosy and cute, but even if the plot stinked, this movie(with its humour) would still be the best movie ever!!
That film was a little overestimated, but it put some humour into the immigration questions in Sweden, although still being serious.
After that it starts to lose its magic, but it's still highly amusing.
!Honeswtly people!This is a Swedish movie with special effects like in Matrix or in Die Hard!This is a parody on many American action movies per example:Matrix,Die Hard,Rambo,etc.There is even love in this movie between Jessica(who wants to close local Police station) and Jacob(the policeman).The humor is original,typically Swedish,but still amazing!tHE ACTORS :Torkel Petersson is one of the best Swedish young comics on this time.Josef Fares and Fares Fares are actually Libanons,who moved to Sweden.Whwn Josef was 21,he was accepted to the Swedish Film Academy in Stockholm.He also directed another box office hit,Jalla Jalla,the film I also liked it.In this movie,you can see a brother,Fares Fares and a Father Fares.So this movie is totally Fares family movie and i really recommend it!
Like the first, this one is guaranteed to get to you in a good way, but still lacks some of the greatness of it.
CAUTION: Not a real spoiler, the spoiler is only the beginning so read ahead until * This is a great movie with more dog scenes, but there is still a thicker plot.
I bought the CD a few years ago and it is still in my top 10 list.
German TV dubbed (and still do)very much anything foreign into German.
I approached this movie with some skepticism: although France is to be commended for being pretty much the only country in the world right now that still produces films based on the works of Agatha Christie and releases them theatrically (the British Poirot and Miss Marple series are still running, of course, but they're made for TV), "Towards Zero" is directed by Pascal Thomas, whose previous Christie adaptation, the 2005 "By The Pricking Of My Thumbs", was about as dull as a film can possibly be.
In my case top-billed Danielle Darrieux - still acting in her ninety first year - was all the inducement I needed to get it up at the box office and the fact that Thomas has made another competent film is a bonus.
Chiara Mastroianni, looking more like her father every day is also on hand to remind us what we lost when her father died and if she bears only a passing resemblance to her mother that's not so important because mum Catherine Deneuve is still very much with us.
This is by no means a brilliant film: it lulls occasionally, and there's something annoyingly trivial about watching a couple of young people talk about their new relationship - universal, but still trivial.
I'm still reserved about him as a director because I saw nothing new from this movie.
Great acting by everyone ( D. Quaid is brilliant as always ) , fast-paced camera angles , and great car chase, totally believable with Opel cars !The only minus to this film if you like waiting for the end credits : it was made in Mexico and not in Spain 's Salamanca , but still convincing !
There's still nuances and (political) criticism to be found here, if you look closely.
The dialogue would still have been rock bottom.
Even though we know what's coming- which is routine throughout the film- it's still a very effective start.
However, I still maintain the masterstroke in Marceau's (brief)film career was his brief appearance in Mel Brooks' 1976 movie "Silent Movie".
Still, despite the shortcomings of the finale, the performers are incredible to watch, the production design is beautiful, the use of sound and music is superb and it's nice to see Castle was still making unique films right up to the end of his career.
Unfortunately, the print quality left much to be desired: it seemed like a tenth-generation VHS copy, with the detail all soft and fuzzy and the picture excessively dark to boot; being a Paramount film, one hopes that Legend Films Â or, better still, Criterion Â will eventually get the opportunity to give this bizarre gem a decent release and, consequently, the exposure it greatly deservesÂsince Paramount themselves seem unwilling to do anything with it!
Don't forget to watch every single second of the movie and the credits, with beautiful still photographs on it.
I still can't help but feel slightly frustrated because of what I think is a missed opportunity of character development....
There's something missing and I still think it is because of the ending that happens a bit too fast and is not as intense as it should be.
The film is weaker, compared to the fantasy films of this kind, but it is still a wondrous Arabian Nights adventure.
It's when her right foot is still a bird's.
Though not as good as the first Sinbad movie, The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad, I still enjoyed watching this one.
But I still can get entertainment out of this film.
The unbelievable stop-motion effects of Harryhausen still look great, even when compared to CGI.
Throughout the movie I like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre, which is still more than I can say for the movie itself.
Goldie Hawn plays a bimbo with smarts again, but one thing that was neat about her role is that they acknowledge her age and "over-the-hill" sex appeal that someone like Richard Gere still hasn't figured out.
Average road comedy that has average production quality and nothing original or new to offer as all presented here have been done better in other films of the same genre.Although still funny at times and big fans of the lead actors here will be entertained because they will see that they still have their talents in 1999.Goldie and Steve are certainly the main attractios here and they did a great performance.Very funny scenes at the last 20 minutes involving a drugged out Steve.Not a big fan of road comedies and the lead actors?Stay away then.....
That's if you're a New Yorker...  Look, the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere, and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment.
But someone or something on the ship is killing them, but still they find enough time to "procreate" before facing the problems at hand, and figuring out just what is happening.
Directer Lee still hasn't fully gained a strong grasp of storytelling yet as a director at this point as the film as it's sometimes difficult to make out why anything's happening in the film, but the potential shows as well, with honest characters and patient development.
Chang-Dong's directorial debut GREEN FISH is a far less ambitious film, but still shows the work of a talented and mature director.
It is still a movie of strong characters, however, and a well told story until the slightly weak ending.
We didn't knew it from the third part and we still don't know from this one.
Even if this film wasn't a Species movie, it's still a movie to stay away from.
The kicking, although not as fancy as some other movies, is still impressive.
People start to die and no one knows what the hell is going on (or how they got there) but still make time to have sex while secret video cameras tape them.
The new gore FX are pretty good and the cast looks good, too, in the sex scenes (which seem to have been trimmed from the cable version, called GALACTIC ODYSSEY), but this is still a cheap, pointless waste of time carelessly slapped together by the same guy who directed the equally terrible DEAD SPACE (1990).
This movie was the first karate/kung-fu movie that i had seen and still today i watch it definately a classic, the Silver Fox is one cool dude anyway good action tons of fights good plot and the usual dubbing but overall 10/10.
The film has virtually the same theme and setting of "Gangs of New York" and still managed to create likable characters.
Even though this is seemingly a more serious film than Shaolin Soccer, it still has the playful humor that made it such a fun movie.
The action doesn't let up much, but you still you want more and more.
Most importantly, the changing age of adult Sing and the Deaf girl back to young kid at the ending part gave a huge hint that they still at their kid age throughout the movie.
While anyone who has seen "Shaolin Soccer" knows that Chow does not employ a normal cast of "heroes", it was still interesting to see that for the most part, almost anyone who could have heroic qualities attributed to them did not fit the "normal" model.
It would be a good background movie for a party or poker game which could catch your eye at any moment and still hold your attention.
I sincerely recommend this movie to those who still has the slightest hesitation whether you should watch this movie or not.Just Go!!!!!!!!!!
My eyes still hurt from wiping away tears of laughter.
It is great to see that it is still possible to make movies this way...
Devil's Prey is not a high budget movie, yet still there are thrills and twists which I enjoyed watching.
I still cannot believe how low the rating is!
It's just one of those movies that you will find at your movie store on DVD with a crappy cover, still there (no one rents it) with no good reviews on the front of it.
I still can't believe that someone is out there distributing the movie, I mean it's even up for rent on Netflix!
I can still appreciate it for what it is, and hopefully writer/director Nichols, whose debut this is, will come up with something as good in the future and do better by it.
Although I wished it had included all of the songs from the opera, this production was still a good way to get acquainted with the "Yeomen of the Guard."
I still have some hopes from "Sarkar" though which opens on July 4th here in the USA.
But I still find it funny.
Believe it or not, you still see this kind of shock-humor today, and you probably always will.
He knows Macauley is a ne'er-do-well shyster these days, but in an odd kind of way he still trusts him.
For various faux pas, the great general has been ordered home in disgrace, but he's still investigating the disappearance of the Reichsbank gold.
One of the best things about this film is that, unlike many of the Warhol-superstar documentaries, the subject is still alive and participates by actually being interviewed (instead of just archival footage).
I would recommend this movie to all people of all ages, whose hearts are still alive and able to sympathize.
My father lived there in the early 60's and still waxes poetic about the landscape and wonderful people he met there.
And those are still important lessons to learn; they're as ageless as the sands.
For all I know, Arabia may have been much more brutish in the 1890's than was depicted in the film as it was still under the thumb of a decaying Ottoman Empire.
Ever since I was 6 years old (now i'm 15) I loved Viggo Mortensen as an actor, poetry writer, etc..... and i still do love him.
It is very interesting how the film's release is timed - while the US is still in Iraq.
Reno says he is saving half this place for his partner, but York still plays dumb and takes a room.
It is sad to see anyone go through this pain and suffering and still on the other hand can so intelligent.
This film would be richer for that sense but still it remains a good, solid mystery.
Despite only having a few hundred men instead of the whole brigade that they expected to get there, they still held out for four days against an S.S. Panzer group.
- doesn't act very well here, but I still find her effort affecting as Ladd's character's love interest.
I still remember the dark, cobbled streets and slick rainy roof tops of eighteenth century European cities -- scenes also not unlike the ones in The Third Man.
He seems more upbeat for the encounter, although the voice-over still has him thinking about practical matters at the end.
However, it is still a fascinating movie, but you must concentrate because the movie is pure conversation, and if you get distracted at all you'll miss something.
Finally, Eileen Caddy, another of the founders (who is still there at  the time of writing) may well be everyone's second favourite  granny (behind HRH The Queen Mother), but she does not talk to  God or even to god.
But he was a stylish but still vicious punk in most of that film.
The key to understand this great movie is the poem by Dylan Thomas: "in my craft or sullen art" "In my craft or sullen art Exercised in the still night When only the moon rages And the lovers lie abed With all their griefs in their arms I labour by singing light Not for ambition or bread Or the strut and trade of charms On the ivory stages But for the common wages Of their most secret heart.
It paints not so bleak a portrait of it's town as "Kes" does, but this still doesn't look like a very pleasant setting.
Far from being the laughable joke that many soft-porn flicks are, Animal Instincts exhibits dramatic irony, conflict, suspense, and even clever wit, but it still has some logical flaws.
But it's still a sexy movie with an unbelievable hot lead actress.
The result is an interesting story and of course some really funny - but still very natural - scenes.
I hope Dale Belding (Mike) is still alive and well.
The film isn't like that at all: still, I'm very happy that I went to see it.
This is a film that musters some good suspense and adrenalin rushes at first, but starts losing them as the kidnapping wears on because it all begins to seem more about politics and the talk than about the action, though wondering how it's going to end is still what's going to keep you watching.
But why the attack by the police - especially with anti-terrorist forces - was still necessary then, is quite beyond me.
Even if you are not that kind of anarchist, there are still some scenes which are just so familiar to yourself.
So while I think the outcome of the movie was what I consider to be not realistic, I still liked the ending, the way I have enjoyed many endings to films that I consider to be fiction.
Even with all of these problems, I still managed to somewhat enjoy the movie because of a pretty decent script, and some very good acting.
Having said that, I still enjoyed this movie very much.
Since there are no "perfect" movies, I still consider this one pretty darn close!
If you're amazed or ashamed that hypocrisy like this still has an audience, try to understand that it's basically a rite-of-passage for lazy film students everywhere.
And better still, you'll get an "A"!
In Thai society prostitution is "illegal" but it has long roots and a strong frame in the history and culture, the job of a prostitute is considered a low one but they are still a completely accepted part of the society.
I'm somewhat prejudiced, since I'm in the film, as the piano player with the Cale Band, but even allowing for that, I still think it's magnificent.
One of the most entertainment and addict games i ever played, i play Heroes III all over the years, and still hook me in front of a screen playing it for hours.
If you like Heroes of Might and Magic III : Restoration of Erathia, i also recommend: Heroes II; Heroes IV; Ages of Wonders ( in my opinion a Heroes of Might and Magic rip off, but still a good game)
Lots of good humor and intentionally broad strokes make the holy teachings vivid and entertaining--and still their message comes through clearly.
Acting is good throughout and some of the special effects are still fun to watch.  
When we're told that the outlaw and his wife have been living in the mountains for years-- long enough to deliver and raise a baby who appears to be about three years old --then discover that they're still in the vicinity of Halla's former property, our credulity is strained.
Except for Raw, it's still OK but Smackdown and ECW are kinda lame.
Baseheart is still perhaps best known as the opening narrator of the '80's hit-series "Knight Rider", starring the immortal David Hasselhoff.
Columbo has done far better than this, but I must admit that compared to more standard TV fare a bad Columbo is still better than a lot of other things you can pass the time with because Peter Falk is in it.
Freddy is still a good character, although more laughable than Scary in this outing, he was humorous in the first movie, but not at the expense of the Horror.
I'm certainly not a major fan of the original, but you know what, I still hate this film as one of the worst ever made.
Yes there were some 'pseudo-gay' references in some scenes which could have been handled differently (director Jack Sholder to this date still denies any intentional use of homo-erotic references).
Freddy Kruger is still very much alive, and not only is he still haunting people's dreams, but now he is trying to get into the real world through the body of Jessie Walsh, a teenage boy who can't figure out if he is really being attacked by Freddy or if he is just flat out losing his mind.
There's less suspense than the first one, its almost non existent but still this is a godd movie, if you wanna see a bad movie watch Mortal Kombat Annihilation, that was bad!
The first of the "Freddy" films I actually saw was part 3, which is still the best in my opinion.
But, I think this movie is still a lot of fun and recognition is definitely due.
Over all, the content is still trashy and the level of entertainment is still average.
Freddy is not quite the One Liner comedian yet (although he is funny), he cracks a few jokes here and there, but mostly he still lurks in this shadows, he's still creepy, and we still take him quite seriously, he still means business!
My next target is the first movie, which I still haven't seen.
Aside from the first film this is the only other from the series that I still like.
The first Nightmare On Elm Street is one of my favorite horror movies.It had an original plot and was very entertaining.Now this is the first of the many sequels that followed it.Sure its not as good as the first and its the second worst one in the series(in my opinion).But its still an entertaining and good 1980's slasher flick.The cast is different from the first film and neither of the actors or actresses from this film return for any of the sequels.In this film, a family moves into the house that Nancy lived in during the first film.Freddy possesses the teenager who lives in the house and makes him do his killings for him.With the help of his girlfriend, he must stop Freddy.Though the sequels are known for their comedy, this film wasn't meant to be a comedy.Yet there are a few laugh out loud scenes in it.Nightmare On Elm Street 2 is an alright sequel that slasher film fans should enjoy.
I've rated this movie before and gave it a five and a pretty bad review but after viewing this movie a few more times I actually quite enjoyed it, OK it's not the best in the franchise, but it's still good and that's why I deleted my old review and started afresh.
But fear not he's still scary, cruel and in the shadows.
Nagesh Kukunoor's masterpiece inspired a lesser ripoff which still managed to keep me engaged.. but that is another topic.
I was so much surprised after watching this movie and my mind still can't let go of the wonderful movie.
Meting Laural would certainly be motivation in itself, cuz Kate Ross was still a doll at the time of the movies' production.
In addition to its being entertaining, enjoyed seeing Kirk Douglas, who although in his mid-60's, still looked vigorous and hale.
And the doggy, who even if young and destined to a long life, would have originally made it at best to, say, 1954 or so, remains in the 1980's, is still young at the flick's end, and participates in the happy aspects of the story's conclusion
I think it is a shame that there was less discussion about what the consequences of stopping the attack might be; both good and bad, still it was a pretty good film; a must see to any fan of military aircraft.
All these years later this is still one of my favorite movies, and I will drop everything I'm doing at the moment just to watch it whenever it is on.

Imagining F-14 Tomcats shooting down Japanese Zeroes shows that America is still grouchy about the surprise attack at Pearl Harbour.
Imagine if the day after President Jack Kennedy was supposed to have been assassinated, on November 23, 1963 when Captain Morrison took command of the Bonhomme Richard aircraft carrier it was really a still alive President Jack Kennedy.
President Jack Kennedy was spotted at author Truman Capotes birthday Party still alive.
Remember that freedom of speech still exists so have fun writing or don't if you choose that course of action.
Just wish the laser disc or the video where still available.
It has its flaws and is dated but the concept is still very valid.
Though still exciting in "box" format, the widescreen original was breathtaking.
I felt sorry for his character as, again, we see the reality that young African-American men, although urged to grow up real fast in the face of taking the big responsibility of heading the household (forgive the run-ons), still have this little kid inside of them who thirsts/screams to be a young child, held and loved.
I'd like to see more of him in the future because despite his years, he still has a lot to offer.
Forgive me I finished the film not long ago and I still feel the effects of this wonderful movie.Its left me with a loss of words.
He does his best to keep the profanity to a minimum, but there's still adult language in it, but nothing inappropriate.
Maybe it's because he still has an optimistic outlook about his life.
I watched this movie often as a kid growing up in the 80's and it was and still is one of my favorite movies.
The comedy is in many ways unique; nothing hits you in the cinema, but you still leave with a smile on your face.
this one is not as dark as celebration or as distressing as the idiots, but they all still seem to run in a similar vein.
This movie is exactly what I look for in a foreign film: culturally different but still understandable and entertaining.
Thank goodness there are still places in the world where the cynical marketing dollar doesn't control all, and real movies can still be made!
There's still time to grab whoever is responsible for this horror (the intellectual kind, not the genre), rip the camera from his hands and plead with him PLEAD!
"I lost both legs and an arm and the side of my face is missing... but are my tits and ass still intact?
.....good then I'm still sssexy" (I was quoting, not paraphrasing) Honestly, even Jesus or the Dalai Lama wouldn't be inspired to feel ANYTHING for the characters on screen.
But if that is the case for you, it's still able to keep it really intense and quite compelling.
All of this action mostly occurs during daylight, but still manages to touch a nerve by trapping you in.
Although I pretty much guessed the general direction the plot was going halfway through, the ride to get there was still edge-of-your-seat stuff.
Simone Simon doesn't take the title role in Mademoiselle Fifi Â that dubious honour goes to Kurt Krueger Â but it's still her best role outside of the Cat People films.
Simon's character may have been changed from a plump prostitute to a petite laundress (this was the 1940s, after all), but the first half, based on the story that inspired Stagecoach, is still a remarkably effective adaptation that segues comfortably into the second story, linking them both by a battle of wills with the titular bored Prussian officer who wants the population to submit to his whims purely as a mark of obsequiousness.
By publishing the script to this film, Esquire showed that it was still an important player in bringing new world class art to the American male mainstream.
It features an anamorphic transfer that looks good but still has that "video" feel about it somewhat.
The first time I did see it was back in the 80s and it still holds that special ingredient to make me come back for more.
But there's a reason Easy Rider still defines the time period, while Two Lane has become grist for a "What Does It Mean" study group.
However they face the same paradox every cinematic anti-hero faces: by separating themselves from society, by refusing to sit still and conform, they're free; it's just them, the engine revving and the road.
The only thing that still permits these people identity and a place in society is through their cars.
But the film is memorable because of its rarity (it has never been released on video and is still unavailable, but has just been released on DVD) and its bizarre and infamous conclusion.
"Schindler's List" vs "Monty Python And The Holy Grail"), but this movie is so unlike almost any others that I still don't know what to make of it.
In modern life in general, I think people talk too much - try sitting still and shutting up for 103 minutes while watching this movie.
And don't be surprised if you're still thinking about it days later.
The script for this film is problematic and there are gaping plot holes and scenes that will cause you to roll your eyes, but it is still watchable because of the photography, the genre and of course, Maggie Q, who will be seen soon in Mission Impossible 3.
Starts off with a bang, okay, now she's in training, alright, she's an assassin, I'm still with you, oh, now she's having this moral dilemma and she can't decide if she loves her boyfriend or her controller, zzzzz.... Oh well, back to Gamera!
Peter Gallegher can't let her go, so he fantasise that she's still there, and goes to the beach to talk with her all the time.Then family comes to visit, and they find out that Peter Gallegher is a mental case.
OK, I know that this movie is based on a play, but still, does the main idea expressed by Peter Gallagher need to directly reflect a line said by John Cage on Ally McBeal 3 years later?
Of the seven primary characters in Gillian, only three really matter: David (Peter Gallagher), a man who, after two years, still isn't over the death of his wife Gillian (Michelle Pfieffer); Rachel (Clare Danes), his daughter, whose relationship with her father isn't too estranged; and Esther (Kathy Baker), David's sister-in-law, who's determined to remove Rachel from David's care for fear it is unhealthy for the girl.
Kristen Bell actually made the character believable, she was and is still Gracie for me.
However, it helps me to know that in real life someone was faced this awful situation and still overcame it with hard work and determination.
Sure, this is pretty much a kids' movie, but it's still fun.
Besides, I'm still pretty young at heart even though I'm past 40 (not immature, mind you!
Just like the first, this little movie is still just as cute, and remains as a great piece of entertainment for children, even if it is straight-to-TV material.
It was funny, mysterious, cool, and interesting, it wasn't as good as number 1, but it was still great!
The acting was excellent and the character Sophie was still as cute as can be!
The writing was excellent and it still had all the excitement from the original film.
I'll second all other comment-writers who point out the witty humor and Errol Flynn's still nimble swashbuckling at 38 in this very entertaining film, but I'd also like to point out another feature of Errol Flynn's performance (also applicable to many other of his films):  He is also good at delivering more serious lines in exchanges with the villains (in a very believable, underplayed manner) and, for that part, more sincere dialogue with the beautiful ladies.
It is still the essence of Flynn's screen personna, and it still brings joy to his fans.
Of course, the plot is really no different from any other swashbuckler, but it's still a heck of a lot of fun.
Robert Douglas is no Basil Rathbone but he still makes a fine villain.The score by Max Steiner is very fast paced and exciting and the duel between Flynn and Douglas is also nicely staged.
Instead it turns out that in The Adventures of Don Juan, not only is our hero still swashbuckling up a storm and almost as handsome as ever -- let's not forget, ten years and many events have now elapsed since Robin Hood -- but he is also man enough to laugh at himself along with the audience.
And he still looks excellent in tights!
And this is Flynn's perfect part, still ladykiller enough to carry off the love scenes, still fit enough to persuade as the great duellist.
Charley Chase made this one-reel comedy back when his screen character was still known as "Jimmie Jump," and it's not as polished as some of his later work.
If you watch it now keep the remote handy to fast forward and check if you still give a damn about the twist in the end, I know I didn't.
generic pap overall, but still it was watchable...if your a Dolph fan, check it, if not avoid.
And I'm still thinking about it a few hours after watching it, which is - to me - always a good thing.
Undoubted nods to the likes of 'The Thing', 'Blair With Project' and 'The Shining' but the director still manages to plant enough plot devices (mysterious white box, weird noises and footprints, well-acted descent into madness) to promise a worthwhile outcome.
Regardless of its stumbles, the film has loads of ambition to do something substantial and enduring, so even when it can't quite deliver on its promise it still beats the slew of cheap-scare horror remakes which every year become more numerous.
I still don't have the darnedest idea!!
When we see them live no matter how many times I watch I still can't help laughing so hard I cry.
According to Gulzar's Lekin, in between is this eternal search for moksha, in between is this struggle against the ghosts of life, where time stands still, till the spirit is free.
I still gave Lekin a 9 but if anyone can tell me where I can easily find the lyrics, I would be very grateful.
Though a good version of this was done in the Fifties by Stewart Granger and James Mason, this one is still by far the best.
The film was so influential that I soon began daydreaming and writing my own adventurous stories of ruling and residing in an imaginary European country of my own creation, which I am still doing unto this day.
I first saw "La Femme Nikita" nearly ten years ago, and it still manages to be my absolute favourite.
It's still a lovely film--just not quite so original.
I like Coleman and Carroll in their leading roles as well as C A. Smith and Niven as the co conspirators   Raymond Massey looks like he is uncomfortable with his lines and would rather be doing Hamlet Nevertheless this is the best version and it still has legs and looks more Gothic than the MGM Vehicle which is saturated in colors and may cause headaches after the first reel  C Pope
The rapier fight between Coleman and Fairbanks is still exciting to watch.
The characters in the movie mentioned a word Âlove' a couple of times but whatever it was in the end the kind of relationship those two people had in the course of the movie gives a clear indication that it was not love even at the beginning - that was all what the bare lust can produce and you could still cheer yourself up with catching the flashes of the seductive Salma's body.
Steve (Russell Crowe) and Monica (Salma Hayek) talk about that they are not together anymore but still hop into bed with one another and then talk and argue until one of them leaves.
So, if you're still with me and this sounds like something that will appeal to your particular tastes, you might want to give it a chance.
However, the show still fails to inspire, as most people who watch HGTV and follow design magazines will likely find their room makeovers nothing short of tacky.
I highly recommend this for viewers interested in a movie that's a little different from the norm, but is still rich, innocent fun.
The Question really is;"How do I tell young people about this terrible tragedy without being to graphic and still holding their attention.
Although she looks frail physically, she nevertheless conveys a deep strength and fearlessness as she uncovers strange elements of her family's past and begins to believe that Jamie may still be alive  The Irish setting is played up very strongly.
is this because a lot of people still haven't seen it yet?
Madonna has proved that age simply made her get better,and that even though she may be under the radar sometimes, she is still very relevant.
Oh man,"Hausu" is an extremely weird and grotesque horror parody.It is also supremely stylish and visually mindblowing.The plot of "House" is quite easy to describe:seven schoolgirls travel to visit grandmother at her spooky old house.It's not clear whose grandmother she is,as every character in the movie is referred to by a nickname and they all call the old woman Ojii.The house turns out to be a demon that wants to eat them and grandmother is apparently a cat.Words can't describe how positively bizarre this movie is.It plays like the cross between "Suspiria" and "Beetlejuice".There are plenty scenes of kitschy humour plus some scares for example when one of the girls tries to sneak the watermelon out,she finds a human head down the well instead.One girl is even eaten by a piano in a very gory fashion and the dead victim's fingers are still playing the piano after being bitten off.9 out of 10.
The chemistry between Jay Jay and Chaos is superb... still funny well into the 2000's.
Every once and a while this little gem shows up on late night TV and it's still fun to watch.
You know the food isn't going to be all that great and it isn't going to be good for you, but you still leave satisfied.
This is still one of my favorites from the early 1980's, and as such, it rates a 7.3/10 from...  the Fiend :.
Upon first viewing I laughed out loud, and I still do, so many times I have watched it now!
The TV series is no thematic sequel to the two movies but still another direction taken by the same characters.
You'll know why those of us who were there still die laughing the hundredth time we hear, "You have gespritzen on un general."
The series is lighter in tone than the film but still exciting when it needs to be.
This is a fine piece of film-making that can work on its own terms and still fall into the framework of a good romantic comedy, so I hope that some genius out there picks it up for a direct to video release and it can deliver some punch on the home market.
My fingers are still crossed!
See this movie if you are tired of watching Sharukh Khan dance and sing around or of Vivek Oberoi beating up a guy 3 times his size and still not being able to draw blood.
I've seen this film only a few times over the years as an adult, but I was still left disturbed by it each time.
The acting is incredible as are the vocals and even if the characters namely John English talk to the audience, it's still funny.
Days later they were still singing away.
Morality seems dated now, but story is still lots of fun if you're into the beach.
The rich lady who was the real target of a scheming greedy man is still at risk of death by murder.
There are many of us who still Love You, and miss You.
This time around, George and Miriam Kerby have finally passed over and aren't bothering Topper anymore, but he's still attracting ghostly presences.
During the actual book (and the drama as still presented in Branson today) the unknown "specter" character appears throughout, is shot, and dies, but before passing, is discovered to be the Shepherd's lost son, and there is a heartfelt resolution of matters towards the end.
Wash Gibbs is a nefarious character, with designs upon Sammy, and a rival of Matt - in both versions - but in the book he is still a "Baldnobber" and gangster.
Eklavya transports you to the vivid land of Rajasthan, where the Local Rana (Boman Irani, splendid) still considers himself the king even though democracy prevails.
I don't know why directors still cast him.
Finally, an excellent movie utilizing the dark and brooding past and secrets of India, while blending them perfectly with the modern era...A Die-Hard Royal Guard who is willing to lay his life for his Rana...A Royal Heir with a guarded past...A powerless Rana who has turned murderous...An uncle with greedy motives...A cop with umpteen respect for the old royal guard, yet lots of anguish against the palace...all this sums up to a great story by a master story-teller, well defined characters, some well executed action shots, and great performances, and you have a modern-day masterpiece...A must watch...Glad to know Indian Film Industry can still churn out great cinema...If anyone is criticising this film, just avoid them...and see this movie...you'll be glad...India has made a mark in the International scene this time...
Bollywood has been churning up some impressive films recently,and improving the quality of their films.But they have yet to learn to master the art of film-making.Their films are not yet perfect or great; they still have a long way to go.But after having seen this film,I'm glad to say that they are getting close.Bollywood has the potential to make great movies and they are trying and improving and almost getting there.But they still fall short of spectacular results.
I would say EKLAVYA is by far the best of the very,very rare number of good films that Bollywood has made throughout their existence.Why,because it's more focused and well made than any of their minute number of good films.It's got rich atmosphere,intriguing setup,brilliant visuals,impressive sets,costumes and a different vision.But,overall,it is still a flawed epic.
However,what really keeps this film afloat is the acting.Each and every actor deserves equal recognition.They all have a part to play and they all help in move the story forward.You can't just give out all the praises to Bachchan alone.He was terrific,but the other actors allowed him to emote the character well.But,of course,Mr.Bachchan's performance is the strength of the film.His silence and his eyes says more than his words.I've never liked this actor and thought he was yet another over-hyped Bollywood actor,like any other.But after watching him in this,I understand why people worship him.But I still thought he could've done a little better.Saif Ali Khan was quite competent and gives a good supporting performance,but his character doesn't allows him to do much.This guy has the looks and moves of a good actor.Sanjay Dutt was just great in his small part.Booman Irani's character was flawed as well,and his acting sometimes goes from over the top to annoying.But if that's what his character was supposed to be,than he succeeds.He manages to make his character dark enough to be impressed.Jackie Shroff , Jimmy Shergil as well as the beautiful Vidya Balan have little to do and wouldn't really comment on them.
Although his latest is not his best, especially given to believe what he could have accomplished, it still rises over contemporary *Bollywood* cinema (I don't count Bharadwaj in that list and Santoshi is an exception).
Like those other films he still has his cutting knife as sharp as it was before.
At this point perhaps he could not decide if he can still continue to be an artist or rather make money out of this?
Though his expressions are not new but still he performs with utter honesty.
It's still a wonder why VV Chopra took so long to go behind the camera again, when he can produce such a masterstroke so effortlessly, so effectively.
In that respect, he is in some sort of a time warp - the world around him has moved on but he still lives by what tradition dictates.
The film unfolds in the present, but this particular royal family still resides in a fog of past glory, entitlement, and unquestioned power.
I still won't go up to a mirror and test the Candyman theory out.
John Wayne plays 'Young Matt Matthews'a young man still mourning his mother and who has sworn a blood oath to kill the man responsible, his father.
Virginia Madsen was excellent and convincing in this movie, the audience really sympathizes with her as her life is turned upside down by the Candyman, and in the end, she still turns out to be a hero.
But Candyman offers her a bargain: her life in exchange for the baby's, who is still alive.
This is a thinking man's horror film that scares the daylights out of you at times while still leading you to think beyond what's on the screen.
Truly one of the very best horror films of the 90's that can disturb your thoughts, penetrate your sense of security, and still provide disturbing gore and violence.
Despite some serious flaws, "The Omega Man" is still a good movie.
So movie is great, give it a watch, but read the book afterwords - you'll be still surprised.
That was 1971...   Three decades later, while it's definitely dated, it's still an entertaining movie to watch.
For me 'The Omega Man', even with its faults and the fact it is now nearly 40 years old, still stands above Will Smith's new version.
staring in angst at an old calendar or losing his mind for a moment hallucinating the sound of telephones ringing in the deserted city still pack a punch.
Quick-paced & tense with good supporting performances from Paul Koslo as "Dutch" & Rosalind Cash as "Lisa" Dated now it is, but still stands the test of time as a truly great 70's sci-fi & if you haven't seen it, then you are in for a treat.
After reading about the plot I was hooked right away: In the future, kick-boxing has been overtaken by cryogenically enhanced fighters, only one man is still 100% human, but when he refuses to fight in the ultimate lethal tournament, the arrangers kidnap his girlfriend/manager and force him to compete!
OK fine.. then he starts summoning, OK... not bad, then it drags out into a non-demon, shapeshifter that gets stronger when it eats flesh, yet still part of some occult plot according to our on-screen expert, some jailhouse nutbag that suddenly offers all of the 'dirt' to shovel into all the plot-holes.
The film could have used some, but I still thought the Beast was convincing.
Editing tricks and flashbacks are overused but still add to the film's impact.
Kudos for the fact that the sympathetic characters in the movie (played by Quaid and McDowell) were actually suggesting that marriage problems need to be fought through and marriage held on to rather than thrown away, but still, frankly, I thought this thing would never end, and the ending, when it finally did arrive, was entirely forgettable.
This movie proves he is still in peak form in this regard.
MacDowell is still not a great actress, but at least she bravely reveals the unattractive underside of a character genuinely at a loss to deal with her best friends' break-up.
Karen and Beth are oddly different, Beth stated that she tried to be more like Karen, but no matter how much she stirred her soup still stuck to the pot.
And I still don't know who ever told MacDowell she could act.
With "Dinner with friends", the married life analysis goes on and this time, it's about the time effect: after years, children, does love is still there or is-it extinguished and we must start it all over again?
I got only one deception: as it is a indoor drama, I am still wondering if there is poor people or working class in America, because the houses or the families are always top!
My mom and dad have been married for years, but still learn from it.
I did have some problems with Kinnear since he still looks fairly young (He's 40) and not like someone who had been married for years (the painted on gray temples didn't help much lol), but it does beat watching him in Auto Focus (solid perfomance, but not entirely factual).
It is still an entertaining movie, but the four actors are more capable than the script allows them to be.  
Treasure city is so full of details in every single shot, over the top, over stylized, but still believable.
A huge still from this film on a book of my father's on Epic movies had long intrigued me but when I had tried to watch it one afternoon several years ago (almost to the day) on Italian TV, I was put off by its utter daftness.
Behind the cold and uncharacteristic crispiness it is obvious that Errol Flynn, although visibly aged, is still the gorgeous sexual animal that made him an exhilarating screen presence, but he is given nothing to work with here.
He did a great job with this character's motivations and was still quite handsome.
Nevertheless, although Tekkonkinkreet is rated R and very violent, it's still a great movie that I truly believe any anime fan will come to love.
This is still basically a story of Victorian England with an upper middle class family's snobbishness along with their traditional folkways and mores.
However, the movie is still interesting and it moves quickly.
Though the story isn't that absorbing, I still recommend this film for its sheer beauty - not only in its look, but for the beauty of Garson, Flynn and Leigh, and the sturdy handsomeness of Pidgeon.
I think a worse problem is that Wolfe is shown in this movie as if he is still in the office; Wolfe really worked with plants and got himself dirty--he didn't just peer at plants through a magnifying glass.
The film rarely sits still its constantly in motion as characters go from place to place or engage in battles for life and death.
I watched very closely and still missed the whodunnit part.
Somehow, the big finale went straight over my little pointy head: I still don't have the vaguest inkling who the baddie is.
Even if he is meant to be an undercover agent, this is still stretching the imagination!
Rant over, I will still be going out to buy the DVD, and will enjoy every second that is on offer, superb!!
But still it's hard to forget all those memorable characters from the earlier movies, such as Hagman, Harris, and Frederickson, whose story lines were often as or more interesting than even Sharpe's.
Daragh O'Malley may be a bit heavier but he still looks capable of clearing out a bar on Friday night.
Sharpe also encounters again that pompous, cowardly aristocrat, General Sir Henry Simmerson, still played with lip- smacking relish by Michael Cochrane.
I still miss the late Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswell, leering and repellent, who liked to talk into his hat when not trying to shoot Sharpe in the back.
Now he's an international Hollywood blockbuster star since LOTR, but still agreed to return to TV for Sharpe, took a huge pay cut to do TV because he loves the part of Sharpe.
Sean Bean and Daragh O'Malley look a little the worse for wear, but their chemistry is still working and there is plenty of swashbuckling afoot in this Indian adventure.
Despite the changes in setting, the events in the movie are still very close to the book - all credit to the authors, and the acting is so professional that the characters are entirely believable.
The most fascinating thing I've found is how it is still bouncing around in my mind.
The whole thing has just a tiny hint of open-endedness to it, which is good, but still offers good explanations for the important things, which is great.
His older brother, Black, on the other hand, is smart, streetwise, good in a fight, and has lost the innocence that White still possess.
The story is simple and predictable, but still fun and very entertaining.
The army is still in power.
I haven't seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it.
They still wear bad clothing and Jamie (Six Mil.
With a low budget you can still make effective horror movies like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or the original "Halloween".
This movie is visually stunning; each shot is framed like a still made by a master photographer.
Therefor it is surprising that the makers of this film managed go effectively translate his stories to an European setting and still maintaining a lot of his philosophy on life.
In the second and most compelling 'chapter' of the movie, Harry (now played by the utterly talented Josse De Pauw) grew out a fairly intelligent adolescent, yet he still hasn't experienced physical love due to a severe (better make that EXTREMELY severe) case of acne.
Even though he still has one close and supportive friend, Harry slowly becomes a bitter, introvert and pessimistic person.
The people seems to be criminals in some way all of them, but still they are sympathetic or if not sympathetic, interesting.
I'm not familiar with the works of Charles Bukowski, on which this film is based, but still, it's rather interesting, if strange.
Not exactly the type of fare I expect from Mondo Macabro but still not a bad film.
The first segment is the lightest of the three, but still packs a punch as we watch the subject discovering sex and eventually getting acquainted with his hand.
The first period is situated in the 1950's, when Harry Vos is still a young kid.
That's also the reason why he still hasn't experienced physical love.
Even though he still has one close friend who supports him as much as he can, Harry slowly becomes a bitter, introvert and pessimistic person.
Most Italian directors put no effort in making their products available to foreigners, and even when they do, you still see a different movie if you're from here.
Now while the plot really is quite unlike the show (in which Steve is NOT the next James Bond, but he is still pretty cool in the show), the basic idea and structure is there.
The torture scenes will make you flinch, the various episodes will make you scratch your head and with all those crazy things you will still appreciate Miike's effort.
This confuses me -- though I definitely didn't grasp everything upon the first viewing of this, I was still instantly amazed at what Miike has set up here: A journey through one man's tortured soul.
Even if you don't feel like you understand everything that's happening, you still realize this film is genius -- maybe you just haven't figured out why yet.
We begin when the Shogunate is on its last legs, but still capable of punishing its enemies.
Here Izo kills everyone in sight, no matter where time and space spontaneously and indefinitely throw him, his spirit still full of rage from his treatment in his past life, seemingly slicing and dicing timelessly till he can finally reach the karmic powers-that-be, one allegorical character played by the great minimalist actor-director Beat Takeshi, whose predecessors put him to death.
Thats one of the classic Samurai swordfighting films with very fast action scenes thats still better than much we get to see today.
Those who are used to the dark humor and inventive violence of Miike's previous films like "Audition" and "Ichi the Killer" won't find it here--the violence is pretty straight forward (but still graphic), and there is no humor here.
Make no mistake, this is still "A Takashi Miike Film".
The constant metaphors that keep popping up throughout the non-stop carnage bring more layers to the film than any 'shock' movie yet Miike still manages to throw in a few gallons of blood and a very interesting place to hide a sword (ladies) for good measure.
You may not get anything from straining at this befuddled movie, but it is still enjoyable and provoking, if not gut-wrenching, experimental cinema.
After watching the film for 2 hours, there was still a lot of head scratching from the audience leaving the theater.
When I first saw the film on a visit to Madrid 1986 it blew my mind completely and after 20 years I'm still in love with this wonderful film.
While it does plod at times, I found myself enough enchanted by the principal protagonist and her Cinderella story that it was still easy to watch the whole thing through to the end.
The clash of commoner life meets royalty can be quite a hit in the modern era, where royal life can still be seen as a novelty sometimes.
Recently rented it (2000) and it's still compelling.
Those scenes were still compelling, half a century later.
Seen today, "Bitter Rice" is still quite an experience.
I am still convinced that something out of the ordinary happened at Roswell in 1947 without the laughable nonsense portrayed in this movie.
But still she aims higher, so she seduces and marries the owner of the freak show!
I usually read the reviews of the users here on IMDb before I watch a movie.I have come to rely on this site for renting and watching films.When I saw the title of this film "The other side of heaven" I felt that the title was somewhat inspiring.After 5 minutes from the actual beginning, I kind of knew what direction it was heading.I still wanted to watch it though.I'm Christian Orthodox, but this has nothing to do with this film or with me thinking to better watch a sample from a movie after reading a review next time.
Careers and even higher education for women were still viewed with suspicion by many.
If you aren't a fan however then I would still suggest you watch it because it really is a bad movie, but because of that it's entertaining and fun so give it a go.
And fewer still are willing to come out of their dark closets of tears and share their experiences, unscripted and undistorted to a camera crew determined to make known to us such a vital, forgotten part of man's history.
Even after the fall of Hitler in 1945, it still took close to fifty whole years and six amendments to finally strike it down.
But, even after we thought the horrible era of an insane ideology was over and done with, heads of government still remained conservative and chose to ignore the ills of their pasts, dragging their feet through the marshes of sludge-bureaucracy.
Additionally, one of the major points of this film should be how many gay concentration camp victims were still treated as prisoners after the war, specifically because of Paragraph 175.
There are only a handful of survivors still alive and living in central Europe, and some refused to appear in the film.
Even cannibal completionists would be hard pressed to consider wasting the money for this movie, especially that there is almost no single feature release still in existence.
It is still alotta fun though.
A friendship that still continues today with hits like the superb Apollo 13 and the completely overrated Da Vinci Code.
Big is still his best film performance of the 80s (and 90s and 00s!)
is still a work of complete order and balance.
It moves me and it takes me back to a time when things where simple and a good story could be told without the bells and whistles and still move you years after.
There are still some funny parts of the movie.
It is still worth a look, but not near this film is style and class.
I remember growing up watching this movie.I loved it then and still do.
This for me is a movie that could have been released today and still do very very well.
If you grew up in the 80's, you can see why this movie still is a great classic!
This is the story of a young professional vertical skateboarder named Mark Rogowski - who went on to earn the nickname "Gator" after inventing a skate-style move all his own - the "Gaite - Aire" And then , later still dropping his last name Rogowski - which he was quoted as saying that the name itself belonged to his father , who was not present in his life.
In his mind, it's still about Gator, even after ten years in prison.
Porky then wakes up to decide whether he still wants his dream girl.
the film is also worth watching for the performances of Bruce Spence & Chris Haywood because these actors are still working !
Worth a look, but still a love or hate affair.
This cult film I still find to be one tasty dark comedy that has a biting satirical edge about it.
Not overlong, it still seems a little slow now at times but it's probably because unlike in the mid 70s when this was considered unique , so much else has been seen.
But still, it's something to check out as a historical reference if nothing else.
I don't understand, seems as though today everybody hates serbs, but through all this time we are still here...thats why our people have a saying "Samo Sloga Srbina Spasava" which translates - "Only Faith Saves Serbs"
In my opinion it suffers somewhat from a low budget yet still manages to impress with screenplay and the gruesome reality it shows.
The same state of mind that influenced this picture is still visible on our streets.
As time passes by the situation improves but our youth still grow up in ghettos, wanting out of the trap.
But this humor is not funny if you know how it was and still is there.
The last lines of Pinki, when there is no more picture, only darkness left, and he dies when he said: "A sve mi se nesto cini, da sam prosao bolje od vas" or in translation: "I still have a weird feeling, that I came through better then you."
I saw this film many years ago, and still think of it as one of the finest movies ever.
I still don't now if these twins are conjoined or not.
I still had my doubts about seeing it, specially since in a different channel there was a movie about a Gambler in Vegas.
The are used to all the questions, and the looks, and they are used to answering them, but the stares and pointing still hurt, and their desire for privacy is something they hold dear.
Lesley Ann Warren fares better as Francine, the twins' mother who gave them up for adoption after they were born, but she's still not as good as the three principal characters.
It's impossible to understand why this movie didn't get access to a wider audience, particularly since co-joined twins were, and still are, a slightly hot topic of the day.
This film is still haunting me, even long after watching it for the first time.
It may hide behind the alternate title "Hard to Die," and utilize the stage name "Arch Stanton" (the name on the grave in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) for director Jim Wynorski, but with most of the same cast returning and with reused ideas and recycled flashbacks, Sorority House Massacre III is still very much the same cheesy movie.
While the stuff portrayed here is pre-'50s, it still makes one nostalgic for the old times.
Using a future time base was smart, removed, but still the possibility being there!
Although a little more on the serious side, his wit and humor still shown through.
I only paid $1.00 to see this movie, and I still felt ripped off.
I saw it for the first time in ages today and its still as touching as the first time I saw it a few years ago.
Even though I can admit that "Bicentennial Man" contains several flawed motives, I still was a little surprised that the film opened to many negative reviews.
I was 7 when Charlie's Angels first aired, little did I think that 30 years later, I would still be talking about the Angels.
I would also like to add, that if you base watching the films on the programmes then you might be disappointed.Although the general idea is still there, the modernised version has certainly made it more male orientated with a lot of the scenes, especially the "Bay Watch" scene in film two.
She was married to a fellow officer when she was still a cop but the marriage ended in divorce.
These three girls were great together and the show was still a lot of fun.
Anyway, at least Kate Jackson's character actor skills were still around to carry the show.
It was still watchable.
There's a reason this movie was forgotten, while Leone's films are still talked about.
They team up Â reluctantly Â to kidnap a certain professor Xantos, who teaches his youthful students to fight a bloodless revolution, but once they found and freed him from his prison cell, the way back to San Bernardino is still very long and full of obstacles, like defeating a marijuana-addicted criminal (the always-amazing Jack Palance!)
Nero, trying to hide his youthful good looks with some prosthetic wrinkles, may be stuck playing the straight man but he still gets his share of screen "moments".
Actually I might still put those two films ahead of this one.
I think Corbucci was vastly underrated because he happened to make movies in the same vicinity as Leone who seemed more likely to pick and choose from various American westerns (even though he's been orally serviced by too many people, I still do like his stuff) whereas Sergio Deuce pounded out some westerns that I think truly compete with the best of Mr. Leone.
This movie doesn't quite reach the level of greatness achieved by Once Upon a Time in the West, The Great Silence or The Good the Bad and The Ugly but it's still a great western.
I can still remember the first time I saw it as a child in a summer time cinema in my town and not only it left a mark in my subconsciousness about the kind of films I was watching at that time, but the music never left my memory and easily comes back without me ask for it.
I guarantee you will still be singing the theme tune a week later!
Despite it's age, 'Forbidden' is still an impressive piece of work.
Fortunately he didn't because although the story is "soggy and 99.44% pure soap opera", using his own words, it still retains powerful moments and excellent interpretations from its main actors: Barbara Stanwyck and Adolphe Menjou.
No doubt that this early talkie, with some flaws or doubtful situations, still partially conceals that behind the camera there is one of the masters of cinema: Frank Capra.
I've said a lot of times that I love romantic comediesÂI still do, you know?
His performance here finds him always beaten down, but still being able of finding the charm his character requires.
Perhaps I still am.
I loved her then as I still do.
I know it is an erotic fantasy, but still it is laughably unrealistic.
Yes, it's true, some of the acting may not be 'world class,' but the film still has a story to tell and, even without the sex scenes, I believe they did just fine.
Though brilliant , "Midnight Express" still haunts me and the repellent treatment of homosexuality in "Fortune in Men's Eyes" made me steer clear of this genre.
"...There are still some things we have yet to imagine", is the slogan of this movie.
Peter MacNicol had an easy, but still memorable performance.
(note--someone snarkily emailed me that it's actually 8 years; I'm not going to watch the movie again to check that fact, but 8 years still doesn't seem like much to me for murder.)
I don't think it would have mattered if Hitler was in the room instead of Sophie, with a migraine attack like that he'd have still curled up with a pillow.
I still feel the same urgency to be reminded of the Holocaust.
Especially with the horrors and torture still so prevalent we still need to recall what happened not so long ago.
Sophie's Choice is still as great as I remember it.
I ardently pray there will be another role for Ms. Streep - even in her older years - that will allow us to become totally engrossed, to get outside of our own lives, to become completely destroyed, delirious, shattered just for a couple of hours, to realize there is still such talent in the world - THAT WE CAN AFFORD TO WATCH, at least.....thank heavens for this magical film.....
I am still in absolute shock from this film.
Before he is about to go into battle, Quinn tells himself, the grass will still grow, the sun will still shine and the river will still flow.
While as Biography, "Buffalo Bill" is probably as accurate as the depiction of Custer in "They Died With Their boots On", it is still excellent film making and a fine vehicle for stalwart Joel McCrea, who, despite performances in excellent non-westerns such as "Sullivan's Travels" and "Foreign Correspondent" was known primarily as a Cowboy Star.
When this film was made, people were still in love with cars, freeways and bringing progress to the west.
In all, although this was a thoroughly nasty movie, it was still quality.
A lot of shots are still frames that last for about 10 minutes, which centers the dialog and gives the movie a realistic feeling.
I was still disgusted and horrified, but (since I learned a lot about abnormal psychology during the intervening years), I saw how brilliant "In the Company of Men" truly is...I've watched it many times since.
In fact, I challenge anyone to sit still through this scene; I've seen the movie five times and it still makes me squirm in my seat.
Without that explanation, he'd still find reasons to be cruel, because his pleasure comes from seeing others in pain.
Only David Coverdale remains in the band from those heady days of my youth but, nonetheless, these guys still put on a show.
Tommy Aldridge returns to remind us that he's still an 8-armed octopus on the drums, truly the master of the double-bass kick...and Coverdale himself can still go from a whisper to a scream with all the power, soul and technical accuracy you remember from 1987.
He works harder than ever to prove that, at the age of 53, he's still one of hard rock's most dynamic front-men.
Just like Series 7: The Contenders - which is brilliant, or House of Nine - which was still pretty good, you get a reality TV show based on people having to kill each other to win.
They handled the Reality-TV show aspect quite well actually, and even though it was rather straight-forward, it was still good.
It still may be the best - you have to see it to believe it!
Watching the once happy elderly couple, now battling family issues/ health problems (which is the main drama driving the story where there are numerously scattered human interest subplots), but also the changing neighbourhood of Coney Island as young jive talking hoons run wild (which populates mainly the beginning and ending but still feels secondary) is engagingly passionate in its ups and downs.
The evocative script is thoughtfully laid out in its exploration of the effects / shake down these central characters find themselves in, as they're stripped to the bone and demoralized, living in a community filled with fear, but still they won't back down and succumb to the turmoil (be it the gangs or their dwindling business).
Amongst the sombre air, is still quite a sunny vibe of hope led by the acting.
While her good looks faded with the years, she still had that pretty smile and I thought that at one part she would break into a medley of her former songs.
I am viewing: Forbidden Love, now on LOGO- NYC, still NO captions!!!
If you have any interest whatsoever in lesbian lives as they really have been and still are lived this is THE documentary to see.
Even though the woman portraited are, of course, living in North America it is still a fabulous documentary, actually quite breathtaking in all its "naturalness".
the doomsday machine is a hunk of space junk,i believe it was filmed in 1968 and shelved till 1972.the cast is noteworthy but wasted,grant Williams(incredible shrinking man)Casey kasum(American top ten DJ) Mala powers,bobby van(navy vs the night monsters)James Craig(the cyclops)and mike Farrell(m*a*s*h*)as a reporter.the Chinese invent a doomsday device and well you know the rest.its a really bad premise and the special fx look hokey.its bottom of the barrel science fiction thats not even so bad its good.if you need a cure for insomnia then by all means watch the doomed doomsday machine.Elvira hosted this film on VHS/DVD too bad mst3k isn't still on they would have a field day with this.1 out of 10.
Lesley Anne Down is a good choice and while she was dubbed she still gives it her all.
I love this Sondheim masterpiece and having seen what Sondheim considers the finest staging ever (New York City Opera) live and on video many times over, the movie still has significant virtues.
But there are still some truly definitive performances and beautifully mounted scenes.
The score is still just as witty and romantic and features a wonderful new version of THE GLAMOROUS LIFE written specifically for the film.
Now have seen it again recently, and it still holds up.
Despite this being on the grungy side (typical for movies between 1970-1981) this is still an appealing film in a sweet kind of way.
But still, someone, maybe Criterion, will put this one out on DVD to satisfy film buffs.
Walker seems to be still playing Bruno, ironic in a world of terminally sincere people.
Incidentally, the loutish Earthquake McGoon is less of a grotesque this time around; Abnerâs parents, though, still look like they belong on another planet â also, Robert Strauss (very popular around this time) turns up under heavy (make that filthy) make-up as Daisy Maeâs opportunistic close relative, whereas Jerry Lewis does a very brief uncredited cameo as a dopey-looking character called Itchy McRabbit!
It's still one of the most thoroughly enjoyable musicals ever adapted from Broadway.
I thought the song about politicians in Washington is still valid today.
The supporting roles were all so colorful and wonderful (I still laugh every time Evil Eye Fleagle scurries into a scene!)
While I was disappointed that some of the songs from the stage version had been deleted like "Love In A Home" and "Progress Is The Root Of All Evil" with one added that was written especially for the movie, it's still one of my favorite musicals.
But it's still a great little movie.
But sadly it seems that bigots still rule in the good IL' US of A.
Nigel Bruce and Frank Morgan are of course both priceless in this movie, because you could ask either of them to read the list of ingredients on a cereal box and they would still exude their own striking personalities, and Powell has a few moments, but his character comes off as stock and flat, just like Crawford's.
The story is a little bit more complex than that of an arcade video game and it still has plenty of plot-wholes.
I mean it, even if you just hate the rest oft he movie it's still worth watching just to enjoy her screen presence.
The acting is generally very unconvincing, still Bai Ling and Alec Newman are more or less OK most of the time.
The story admittedly is a little thin, and some times too emotional but still it was nice to watch.
But still a disappointment.
The characters were every bit as likable as they were in the first- Bambi if you forgive the fact his facial expressions were overdone at times, was still adorable and appealing, and Thumper is hilarious.
And still laughing about those growling frogs!
Sometimes there is silence in the forest, and a character standing still while the light falls just so, to convey wonder or loneliness.
I must have cried 5 liters... And it left me with such an impact that I still remember the feeling that I had....
I am still a little confused by how many springs go by before the birth of the twin fawns.
I am partial to these movies because I live in Wisconsin where deer hunting is part of our culture but this one is still a cute movie(I really wish we'd get a look at the hunters in these movies though!).
The one flaw that comes into sequels is how different the voices are from the previous film, despite that you can still notice a difference, Bambi 2 fits the voices very well for the characters.
I also enjoyed this new chapter into Bambi's life as he is learning how to become a prince, but still holding onto his childhood and his favorite friends.
Faline and Bambi are suddenly in looooove with each other, ignoring the fact that they'd still be in the cootie phase at that point in time if you paid any attention to the original film.
It's fresh enough with it's humor but still stays on track with the feel of a classic Disney movie from the the opening scenes to the the musical score.
I'm an 18 year old guy, and I watched Bambi for the first time when I was 3 years old and I still remember how sad I felt when his mom died.
Story-wise, well....that's one of the things that I still ain't all that thrilled about .
Despite having been "kiddiefied" from a book that was essentially written for adults, the original "Bambi" was still a wonderful film that catered to both ends of the age spectrum, a talent that Uncle Walt had in spades.
On the other side of the coin, The Great Prince looked gorgeous as did the other deer.......Friend Owl was drawn absolutely spot on, though Thumper and Flower did look nice they still did'nt look quite enough like their original incarnations to retain all their charms.
Despite it's flaws, it's still better than all the previous Disneytoon releases and well worth at least one watch.
You can see director Peter Weir was still learning his craft with this film.
But I have a feeling that she still remembers this film because we both had a great time watching it, and we spoke of it for years afterwards.
Only when the film moves to land sequences does it have any credibility and there are still plenty of cardboard backdrops to help the film become even more foolish.
British Naval Intelligence meanwhile spread rumours of an advancing fleet awaiting the German ship as soon as it leaves port, although only the still damaged Ajax and Achilles are within striking distance.
I still think it is a good film by war film standards, but certainly not as strong as something like "The Cruel Sea" which is a more harder hitting adult film.
One very minor gripe is that in some of the shots of the "Graf Spee" the US Navy extras playing the 'German' sailors are still wearing US Navy uniforms!
When it came up against determined though still inferior-gunned adversaries, Langsdorff's response was to cut and run.
They would make one more movie the next year, a film Powell called nothing more than a programmer, and they would then go, still friends, their separate ways.
If The Battle of the River Plate is not one of them, it still is an effective, professional and clever movie, and so typical of the way these two men avoided conventionality.
Even though Juan Peron had not taken charge in Argentina, it was still friendlier to the Germans than Uruguay was.
I really admired their honesty in showing the battle and what happened later as objectively as it could be, whilst still (always) remaining good entertainment.
Christopher Lee as Manolo, the jealous bar owner; Anthony Quayle as Commodore Harwood; Anthony Newly as a sailor with about three lines that he still manages to over-act; and John Gregson, who plays Capt.
Vinnie Jones does end up getting a bit more coverage than it first looks like he will, but he's still missing for quite a bit of it and certainly doesn't feel like the main player in it all.
That said, I still enjoyed this film, especially because of the acting and dialog between Karloff and Lugosi.
The setting was very different from the old castle settings of Frankenstein and Dracula, but its modern feel (I'm sorry I know little about architecture and interior design) still managed to carry a menace and dark atmosphere that was very appropriate.
Of course, the movie isn't as good as, say, 'Event Horizon' but it's still good enough.
It's a scene that still packs a wallop and, in its own way, lends Lugosi's later flaying alive of Karloff a sense of wrongs being righted.
The first season was truly the best, but I will admit when the show changed its title to Lobo and the characters moved to Atlanta Georgia to be country cops in the big city, that sucked, but I still watched them.
for whatever reason, pieces of the theme song are still clear in my head, even though i haven't seen this show since about 1981. being a huge simpsons fan, i delight in all of their pop culture references and this show was referenced close to a half dozen times.
Still, there are some genuine zingers in the tale and the insights are still just as compelling as they are in other Hong films.
The three shortly gather for a night of drinking, although ultimately, the film doesn't show any emotional culmination or yet still arrive at an apparent close.
To me, though I was not blown away by the movie, I still had a lot of reaction to it, ultimately that Sang-soo's elegantly broken storytelling reflects that our reminiscences can bring not much solace.
However, the middle portion and the section involving the satanic cult seemed like it wasn't fully hashed out--like the script still needed some work to make the film seem more credible.
But the movie is still pretty impressive with great performances overall (especially by Allison Elliot - that woman has got more talent in her little finger than a lot of big stars do, and Richard Harris' son is great,too), an effective score which includes some cool songs (too bad there is not CD out - how canI get hold of "Rockets" or the song played during the end credits?)
Excellently directed by Ulmer, The Black Cat still today has the ability to genuinely unnerve the viewer.
I am still crying thinking of the ending.
I enjoyed it and still enjoyed it when I saw it recently.
It also, in many ways, hearkens back to the early westerns of William S. Hart which date from 1914 to 1925, when movies were still in their infancy.
Even with the rules thus outlined, Ladd still has a chance to present his standard beguiling bad guy early in the film, merely holding back a victorious smile as he pretends confusion over the elder Lavery's excited reaction to his birthmarkÂ   Besides its other values, "Branded" is a visual delightÂ In fact, the movie's one drawback as a Western entertainment is a lack of big action highlightsÂ
Still, it doesn't completely detract from the power of the film and the many memorable scenes including the infamous "grapefruit in the face" moment, Tom's brutal, cold slaying of Putty Nose and the famous ending which still packs a surreal wallop to this day.
This is a classic gangster film which is surprisingly hard hitting for its age, it amazing to think that this film is nearly eighty years old and that prohibition was still in force when it was made.
The violence is never graphic although it can still be fairly hard hitting such as when Tommy goes into the stable of the horse which had killed Nails and two shots ring out and the films most famous scene where he pushes half a grapefruit into his girl friend's face.
), a tight 84 minute running time, and an uncompromisingly dark and depressing ending, this extremely hard-edged film still packs one hell of a potent punch even today.
James Cagney is perfect in his trademark role, and this movie is still good in 2006.
You can still feel the various artists involved trying to feel their way around the new era of motion pictures, and as a result, parts of the film are uneven.
This is James Cagney's fifth film, The Public Enemy, as it still shocks today with its incredible violence and story of two best buddies who get into crime together.
But, also like almost all of the early 30's horror films, it is unique, ingenious in it's way, and still worthy of discovery by a new generation.
Stylish, starmaking, still effective crime meller by the under- appreciated Bill Wellman, in which James Cagney gives a riveting, stunningly brilliant, rightly careermaking perf; one which sealed his fame, secured his rep, and in some ways haunted him for much of his early career.
And, famously, Mae Clarke receives the halved grapefruit, in the face, from Cagney; it's still a great scene, but "The Public Enemy" has much better scenes -- Cagney's visit to the tailor, his walk in the rain, and the film's ending are all superior to the "grapefruit scene".
We still have cousins in the old neighborhood to this very day.
Finally Werdegast finds the body of his just murdered daughter, becomes enraged and confronts Poelzig and............  Boris Karloff was still being billed as "Karloff" at this time.
Seventy five years later they could still be putting the same captions into their films, as each generation finds a way to deal with it's own brand of criminal enterprise.
The film doesn't feature quite as much mob warfare as I expected, probably another sign that the model was still being established.
It is such a well-crafted and honest film that it still has the power to shock us.
America was attempting to adjust to the aftermath of World War I (which is explored brilliantly in this film in a sequence through which Tom's brother, Mike, refuses to drink from a keg of beer smuggled in by Tom for his dinner party) People like Mike were still trying to feel that sense of loyalty towards the government after World War I.
In all the film may be dated but it still very, very watchable and one of the great crime movies of all time.
Ulmer's masterpiece is still Detour where he has a storyline that finally matches his directorial talent.
This hardens the police investigation while the killer (on a motorcycle and carrying an authentic butcher knife) is still on the loose.
Though not especially gory the film still offers up a few grisly doozies, though the best moment effects wise (it involves someones hand) is best seen through adept use of the pause button to focus on the frame or two for which the full glory of the effect is seen.
Its not a perfect film, falling down a little in its giallo capacity, great set pieces but not so much in the way of explanation, the ending is a tad abrupt and in general a bit more development could have given it somewhat more of an impact, but for me it was still pretty darn fine.
That's not really a big deal, since that happens in real life more often that not, but it's still jarring to see it on screen.
Crawford, in blackface, descends the staircase (still silently counting her simplistic dance steps and "posing" rather than dancing).
For those reasons alone it's still worth a watch.
Whenever someone talks about Universal classic horror films, two names always tend to show up in the course of the conversation: Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, two very different yet still similar persons who in 1931 shared the privilege of becoming the first monsters of the sound era in two enormously influential films.
As the young couple, David Manners (Lugosi's costar in "Dracula") and Julie Bishop are nothing surprising, but still are very effective in their performances considering that the spotlight is not on them.
While flawed, "The Black Cat" is still one of the best horror films from the 30s, and certainly one of the best (and definitely the darkest) of the ones produced by Universal.
I still enjoy it to this day.
Dated, even when it was made, this movie is still good fun.
Today it remains a still timely, pertinent and even frightfully plausible cautionary tale about the perils of artificial intelligence run amok.
This film may look a little dated today, but the fear factor is still strong.
I have managed to watch a widescreen version, and I must say that it still adds up,despite the dated technology.The film has no stars in it, which is good because you are solely focused on the story and nothing else.What is refreshing is that this is sci -fi that refuses to dumb down-hardly any violence,flashy effects and no sex.
Dated though the threat may seem, the movie still works well.
I felt compelled to write about "Colossus: the Forbin Project" as it is still on my mind.
The lower floor is an expressionistic prison, also clean lined, but still dungeon-like with its windowless walls of exposed board-formed concrete.
I have recently watched Colossus for the first time in many years and find it still a classic for sci-fi purists.
This underrated science fiction/suspense drama, though arguably dated in terms of technology, is still a frightening allegory about humans allowing our technological creations to rule us.
Joseph Sargent's direction is efficient, and the special effects work of Albert Whitlock still manages to work despite its obvious age.
The movie is 35 years old now but it is still the most intelligent and accurate portrayal of Artificial Intelligence ever put on film.
Made the year after what many consider MÃ©liÃ¨s' masterpiece LE VOYAGE DANS LA LUNE (A TRIP TO THE MOON) and not nearly as elaborate or impressive as that work, this is still a great piece of film history no film fan will have a problem spending 60 seconds of their time viewing.
Not as great as I thought it would be, but still it's highly entertaining.
I recommend this for parents to show their children if they are not too old to watch it and still think children shows are funny.. like the simple bong on the head or tripping..
Sure there are a lot of easy gags like fart or butt jokes, but I think I'm mature enough to admit that they're still funny....and always will be.
I haven't seen the 1960's version of this, but this is still okay for me.
And then there is still Ben played by Tony Todd, this has got to be a cool role he plays and very good acting too, as he plays the loner from the city who seems to know how to fight these beings.
With so many horror films being remade we lose the flavor of the original but the essence of the original is still here in this flick.
You can never top the 1968-version, it will never be done, because it was so revolutionary (still is) and original.
However, although the film will undoubtedly feel extremely familiar to fans of the 'Dead' series, there is still much to enjoy about Savini's effort, and it is highly recommended viewing nonetheless.
Professional and surprisingly successful remake of George A. Romero's groundbreaking horror milestone with the same title, that retells Â in color Â the simplistic, yet still very unsettling premise of recently deceased corpses that rise from their tombs for unknown reasons, and go after the living.
This new version also is a full-blooded and genuine horror film with loads of tension (even though you mostly know what'll happen next, it's still scary), good acting (a lovely B-cast with names like Tony Todd, Tom Towles and Bill Moseley) and excellent make-up effects (although, it has to be said, the gore is a less outrageous than expected).
However, even if you swear by the original and know it by heart, I'd still like to encourage you to watch this version for the following reason: after about sixty minutes of sticking loyally to the original, Savini's "Night of the Living Dead" all of a sudden stops being a homage and NEW script-elements, either specifically added or recovered ideas that didn't made the final cut of the 1968 version, are brought in!
It's OK--but the original is still the best.
Even though it is extremely long (134 minutes), still you never notice the time passing.
There are no epic scenes or battle scenes - mainly it is two to three people talking leisurely in each scene... still it somehow has some kind of magic that keeps your attention all the time.
Morand it's still a big surprise when he's finally exposed at the end of the movie.
Young people in college or not, who lives were affected, not just by popular art (as the Beatles started out)..but into a whole majestic realm of thinking individually and still be a part of whatever movement touched your fancy.
With this said i still much recommend this movie to all in favor of classic war-movies.
in our society, people do still glorify and reward the officers and soldiers of armed forces (for the most part) who serve their countries.
The issue is still cropping up in the U.S. actions in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iraq.
But there are still amusing incidents left in the film.
I think screenwriter Paul Dehn tightened things up a bit, plot-wise, but for those who still insist that "The Night of the Generals" is over-long, I would point out that distilling any 300+ page book down into even a 146 minute screenplay is no easy matter.
After more that 30 years, I still remember the haunting musical theme very clearly.
Another great thing were the sets that were wonderful and even now 70 years later they still look very modern.
They don't mute the environment when it is needed, and the explosion sounds still have the usual echo-shrieking effect.
This question still bugs me...
Lots has already been said - including the huge advertising campaign (centring on a poster, supposedly of a scene in the beginning of the film but as a painting, not a movie still.
"The Black Cat" is still considered one of the best to this very day, and it has not dated nearly as much as some of the other horror stories.
It is still as disturbing as it was in 1934, with its villain not only creepy but literally evil, right down to Boris Karloff's eerie first appearance.
"Detour," often regarded as his finest moment, was shot in six days with a band of B-actors, yet it still remains a cult classic today, even finding a spot in Roger Ebert's Great Movies compilation.
Seen it ages ago ,still the memories stay as fresh as seen the first time.
As for the plot, despite the facts that so much of the script is wrong, it still is a very captivating movie and at least it captures the essence of who Reavis was--even though the details are more than a little wrong.
(In fact it was just as his career was coming apart -- he had recently disowned "Shark" a/k/a "Caine" and was contemplating "The Big Red One," still several years off.)
The film still works, and I'm viewing it from a far different perspective.
Borderline camp to be sure, WHIRLPOOL is still a lot of fun.
I was even pulled up by the scenes of the blood-marks on the floor from Ferrer's character as something you didn't see everyday in the sanitised, Hollywood still coming to terms with the Communist witch-hunt in the post-war era.
Naturally there's a large degree of implausibility about just how Tierney finds herself under the control of such a toxic character and the denouement is perhaps more complicated and played out than it might be but this is still a highly intelligent, challenging piece of cinema, further pushing back the barriers of adult cinema in late 40's Hollywood.
Definitely an off-beat movie of the noir genre, it is still a very watchable one.
While I never found Preminger's "Laura" or "Angel Face" on par with the film noir masterpieces such as "Out of the Past" and "The Lady From Shangai", they still deserve their high reputation in the genre, for they are superbly crafted full of some interesting characters.
Such is the same of this movie: it may leave me a bit cold (as the murder mystery is the drive of the story, not the otherwise enriching characters- Laura suffers from the same), but its still VERY entertaining with great performances and that wonderful pessimism on American life film noir is known for.
Ferrer plays this role with style, he's a big scumbag (a murderer, blackmailer, and there are remote possibilities that he made Tierney do more then clean up his dirty work), but he does this with class, I could still buy why Tierney (and others, such as his society friends) decided to trust a man who had given her plenty of warning signs.
An odd choice but Jose F. does a great job too...his hospital scene still makes me wince when he gets up from his bed!
It is still a joy to watch for itself, but made timeless by the despicable, love-to-hate-him performance of Jose Ferrer.
However, the Whirlpool is still fun to watch, especially for the lovely Gene Tierney who apparently used Whirlpool as a comeback after a two-year absence.
And while Mantan's antics, especially his looks of fright, would probably not do in these politically correct times, he still can be entertainingly funny with what he does here and I don't think it reflects badly on his race at all since to me he's just a funny looking clown who's quite endearing, whatever the race.
He treks through the wasteland that was once a fertile continent and joins a herd looking for a mythical breeding ground that may still be untouched.
"Stan Cooper" plays a more or less straight-laced young German Lt. in command of what is portrayed as the last functioning Panzer tank still fighting World War II, cut off from German lines after a devastating ambush knocks out all of the other Panzers in his column retreating from Normandy after the allied D-Day invasion, the German war effort obviously lost beyond any hope & the Nazis in a near panic as defeat looms.
I agree with everyone else that the story is little more than "The Land Before Time" revisited, but I still think it works (for the most part).
In terms of plot and story, however, DINOSAUR is still not well developed.
Still, nonetheless, DINOSAUR is still a wonderfully good-looking fantasy that appeals to kids and adults.
It's still good as visual entertainment.
this film is hard to resist, I watch it like 24/7 it's an amazing even though the plot is thin, the animation and the cast were the best part of the film, this film is like greatest film ever because of how realistic it looks real including the meteor crash, even though if a remake was being made they had to thicken the plot a bit but still keep the magic this film holds and also add a bit more cast members because their were like only 10 real characters that actually spoke words when the rest were just roars and grunts, so adding more characters would be great, also when i watch this i forget the fact it's a Disney film because of the little amount violence and the fact there is no songs because that would make it quite a silly film so i'am glad that they put any songs on.
Six years later, I am still saying that but with newer animated efforts.
is true, but somehow it still works and produces an enjoyable movie.
Although some of the references in this film are lost to younger viewers, I still think it has held up well and certainly is worth watching even if you are not a Davis or Bogart fan per se.
While the film still shows its stage origins, it works for the claustrophobic atmosphere to keep locations to a minimum.
The other star, of course, is Bette Davis, still fairly new to Hollywood (just five years in) but nevertheless well established with almost thirty movies made.
I had just finished reading a long, thorough history of World War I when I saw this one and even though this is some twenty years after that awful catastrophe (all wars usually are, but this one especially), one can still feel it's aftershocks rolling through that desolate landscape.
Because human nature doesn't change that much, perhaps that's why this brilliant stage piece still holds my respect.
Mix in blender: out comes a classic from 1936 which still tastes good today.
Directed by Delbert Mann, the play featured Lauren Bacall in the Davis role and Henry Fonda in Howard's part... After all those years, Bogart still had the character down perfectly and received excellent noticesÂ
Only the Doctor can put things right, but he is still out cold...  Tennant spends most of the programme asleep, but as soon as he wakes up, assumes control of the situation.
Also, this director has a great cast of actors and yet they still end up sucking (though I personally don't blame the actors, I blame the director).
It manages to be funny while still masterfully tapping into the spirit of the adventure stories it spoofs
One of the lesser Cassavetes, this one is kind of hard to figure out,  but it's still worth seeing if only for Ben Gazarras performance.
While Cassavetes has the themes that ran through the pulpiest stories and the most thrilling thrillers of the 40s and 50s, its still Casavetes through and through.
And the way that Cassavetes opens and closes his film is most intriguing of all (if one is still watching by the end, as mentioned it might turn off some viewers expecting a more conventional narrative)- we see the singer, who has no self-confidence following night after night being booed while trying to have his own unique style in singing for the girls to dance to, and finally he just walks off after not being able to take any more (this is the last shot, following an ambiguous end for Cosmo, as his fate is left open to chance or damnation).
Obviously this was a very personal project for Cassavetes, but it was still regarded as a failure for the acclaimed director.
While its reputation has grown a bit in stature, the critical opinion is still very mixed.
As a result Cassavetes cut the film by half an hour, to a still mind-numbing 109 minutes, but it didn't get a theatrical release.
- My chief complaint at the time (& still) is the Mr.
By the very end he's still quiet, introspective and closed, but we get the feeling he's taken a look at his life and how he goes through it, and he's less than satisfied.
I'm still unsettled from having watched this for the first time.
However, it's pleasant - it still makes for a worthwhile watch on TV, and predictably - of course the best moment is when they finally are together after all.
And this was the largest problem with the film: the film is beautifully shot, well acted, well told, but you still can't work out the murderer's motivation or empathise with her.
Exhibit A: cop finds out his pretty but sulky witness has attempted suicide several times, turns around and leaves her alone in his flat with his one and only gun, then goes after a serial killer without any weapon, gets mauled in the process, survives the ordeal, chases the killer a second time, this time still without any weapon... And just when you think it can't get any dumber than this, well, that's exhibit A, and as Picard puts it, "Plenty of letters left in in the alphabet"  A thinking person's movie?
Doubtless other viewers will predict the plot points with superhuman speed...still, I enjoy the spectacle even when I'm mystified.
It gives new life to any old, tired story or scenario Â better still when it's harsh and good-looking and violent and surprising, like this.
Even if it were, it would still be engrossing and disturbing, crafted with care and with a fantastic soundtrack.
We are now into Season 3 of this series and any Christie purists still watching at this stage should know exactly what to expect - Christie 'spinning in her grave' is a very over used phrase!
I am not outraged by the insertion of Miss Marple so long as the overall result is still satisfactory and this time it is.
I still don't see why the murderer felt the need to kill her.
Most of these stories can be dramatized very close to the original and still be very, very good for today.
I particularly disliked Hester, a whiny daddy's girl who's revealed to have had a fling with sister Mary's husband--and still manages to treat HIM like the bad guy, as if it didn't take TWO to dance that tango.
George de la Pena is still a wonderful dancer and Patrick Swayze is really incredible.
The show hasn't even been on for years, I just signed up for IMDb so I can check out movies etc and yet still here I am, years later, coming to this page, one of the first ten pages I visited after I signed up for this service just to complain about how awful this show was.
In a history of making terrible, terrible, terrible shows Pop Cultured still stands out as maybe the absolute, #1, Very Worst show that the Comedy Network has ever produced and broadcast over the airwaves to an unsuspecting and soon-to-be-very-angry viewing public.
I'm 40, and still love these long haired musicians - geez, what's wrong with me?
I still do....
Not only was it a beautiful love story, but it had one kick-ass soundtrack (which confoundedly is still not available on CD -- someone please release it!)
Or at least made me feel better, I am still to this day believing that Rex was so much better than even he knew, I know he has gone on to do so much in Broadway and I have heard real estate, but "you take my breath away " was our wedding song, I would have liked to see a "Sooner or later 2"  Dam I miss those days
and I still remember going to school after watching it the night before and all the girls in my class were buzzing about it.
I still do.
I still love this movie!
I guess deep down in, I still do!
He's still sexy.
The teenage boy isn't a disrespectful, selfish dummy only out for one thing and he's still sexy and cool.
FYI--If you want to see the worst episode, there are still probably two or three that managed to surpass this one in lousiness.
They were still getting their feet wet on the technology, deciding what exactly this and that could and couldn't do.
But the sentiment behind it is very much appreciated (although it was already being "covered" by Nichelle Nichols - still never too much of a good thing).
It's still all splendid fun, of course, and I recommend it wholeheartedly over all modern TV programmes.
I am eighteen years old and it still tugged at my heartstrings and drew tears to my eyes.
Sometimes I also think the actresses who voice Lucy have had too strident of voices, but Robin Kohn isn't strident enough and by far, Pamelyn Ferdin is still the best Lucy voice actress.
"A Charlie Brown Christmas" is still my all time favorite Xmas special and most of the early specials remain among my favorites.
And I saw "A Boy named Charlie Brown" at the theatre as a kid and still love it.
You probably think Im just getting old, but I still love the early specials and the first movie and I still love reading classic strips.
Even now I still get choked up at the farewell party and Chuck's sad song when Snoopy leaves home.
I still dance a bit to the scene when Snoopy and Woodstock have a little concert while they set up camp and make dinner and YES!
Though the animation is still fairly simple here, it's a notch above the usual Peanuts movies and specials - check out the beautiful backgrounds of the beach scenes, or the wonderful palettes displayed as Snoopy and Woodstock travel at sunset.
I'm 21 now, and I'm still watching this movie over and over.
Unlike the first movie, here both Peppermint Patty and Woodstock appear, although Marcie is still missing.
There is one particular section that still makes me cry to this day at a party for Snoopy, where poor Charlie Brown is just too choked to say anything.
It's not a classic, but it's still memorable, and has some actually quite good songs that are not in the least bit intrusive and only add to the overall charm.
But of the dozens of Peanuts specials- and the short-lived television series- this is one of the better ones, as there are some moments that still stick in my mind many years after seeing it.
Now I'm 34 and still think it's really, really cool.
One of the more sadder animations out there(especially for a Snoopy cartoon) but still very enjoyable.
I don't have children, but I still think this is a delightful film and I have my own personal video copy.
Whatever the reasons I still give this movie a top rating, four stars, the best!
But still, shortly after watching it, that title has a point... 10/10.
But still this is a pretty good game and I suggest you try it out.
The behavioral features of the characters made this really fun, because by standing still for a bit (as a dinosaur) your character would look around and move its' body in amusing dinosaur fashions.
Besides the surprising lack of fun being a tyrannosaur (you move slow and you're an easy target, but it's still neat in it's own way since he's basically a rampaging house!
Generally, I thought that Peter Redgrave as Fowler (a middle aged, jaded British journalist) and Audie Murphy as "The American" put on pretty decent performances, I appreciated the look (somewhat limited but still present) at Vietnamese culture, and I also appreciated the portrayal of the very early years of the Vietnam War, when it was still the French dealing with a Communist insurgency in what was then an integral part of their Empire.
Not, as some claim, Graham Greene's best work, but still a fine meditation on Southeast Asian events before they actually occurred by someone who understood.
Don't forget that in 1956 the city scapes of Saigon and the countryside still had not been modernized; you are seeing the real thing.
The basic plot of "The Benders" is inspired by one of the oldest but still one of the greatest horror/cult movies ever made, namely "The Most Dangerous Game".
Adapting urban legends is a trademark of the show, and I'm not really sure that this particular tale has a name, but it's still familiar.
Since he's still wanted for murder (Thanks to that shape-shifter in "Skin" killing those people and wearing Dean's face) Dean lies to a local police officer named Kathleen, telling her that he's from the state police.
He's still not willing to back down from being a smart-ass.
But, unless Dean took the time to also pick the lock on the handcuff side that was still attached to the cars door, it just doesn't seem to make sense.
I don't know if this is a spoiler or not, but I have no doubt that if the extremely unlikely events depicted in this teleplay ever occurred, millions of us (literally) would be out in the streets, guns in hand (yes, we still have guns up here!).
It's not like the concept of this movie is any less silly than that of the first movie but at least the first movie still somewhat worked out, since it was a fine, formulaic though fine, crafted simple piece of horror.
Oh well, at least that one apparently has Lance Henriksen still in it.
What can you expect from a B-grade sequel to a movie that, in spite of Mira Sorvino and some nifty special f/x, still failed to deliver a minimum of excitement?
I also recommend seeing the original first; it is not as good as this one, however it is still a very good, and important film, as that is the one that started it all.
Segonzac still achieves an alienating gloom beneath all of the camp, and the film is routinely suspenseful--it's difficult to not be suspenseful when you're dealing with bugs.
But it was still one of those heart wrenching moments which had me in tears (im a girl, its OK to cry at supernatural....saying that though i defy even a boy to not cry at that scene!).
It reflects the brilliance of the supernatural team when even during the most tense and saddening finale, they can still manage to inject some humour to keep things from becoming emo sad.
As a whole the episode is flawed and far from perfect, but still good.
And despite the fact that the promo for this episode gave away one of the most emotional moments, that moment is still moving and wonderfully portrayed.
Does anyone know if they are still making the Mahabatra?
Yashraj are still ruling.
I know the movie was terrible, but it could have been 100 times better (and I only say that because anything times zero is still zero)without the Sahara sound-effects.
The shark chows down and we see a camera with an arm from the elbow down still holding on.).
Of course, Warner Bros. was still finding its feet as an animation studio and 'The Night Watchman' is not significantly worse than many of the lesser cartoons of the time but, other than its historical importance as Jones's debut, there's really nothing here that I'd recommend to the casual cartoon fan.
Seldom seen these days on television, it still keeps the romantic promise we remembered.
This film even with its unlikely premise is still a nice way to spend time with pleasant company.
In addition to the artistry with which this story is told, this film has a very nihilistic sense of justice and not-so-subtly points out the fact that state authorized murder is still murder.
So there he was, still right smack dab right there in the midst of being the golly gee whiz teen-aged lad.
Whenever the actors stand still, he has a horse or an extra trot past in the background.
When Cooper and Brian sit together among the trees, the only movement is the wind gently rustling their clothing, giving a quiet tenderness to the moment without quite allowing things to be completely still.
The story of a ranch foreman who has to hang his best friend Steve for stealing cattle under Trampas and the schoolmarm Molly who loves him is still a compelling story to tell for the early talkie era though it might seem old-fashioned today.
There is, however, an interesting exchange between the schoolmarm (Mary Brian) and an old pioneer woman (Helen Ware) about violence vs. pacifism that still seems relevant today no matter if you're conservative or liberal.
Real western historians in fact are still trying to separate truth from myth about all these people because of these stories.
She still looks charming and can dance unbelievably well.
But the magic is still on.
Does the actress still possess the charisma to ignite fire in water?
she apparently is still Indian, and I'm glad :) i'd give this movie a ten out of ten, because the acting is great and also the dance..
The Song Is Somehow a Mixture of M. Jackson Music but still feels like Bolly!
Its storyline may be somewhat predictable from the onset but its still an untapped genre in Bollywood.
And I am really glad to say that she's still easily the best of actresses Indian Film has seen.
Madhuri Dixit's charm is still there and this movie, for all her fans, is worth watching - this is the return of Madhuri.
Aaja Nachle is Madhuri Dixit's case for still being the best out there.
Though I didn't find the film as demented as I expected it to be there are still moments that could cause a fair amount of offense.
And the film is still unique and original 30+ years later, so I give it credit for that.
This is not a movie that can weather the times and still be enjoyed and understood by future generations.
We still pretty much stand by that judgment.
I still have his autograph and picture of me and him in front of the ice cream parlor that they filmed at a couple of scenes.
Looking back on it, I still think that it was pretty funny, but was it the most mature movie?
They want to parody the Bollywood tearjerker and still cater to the section of audience that wants to believe it to be real.
Then, the writer-director duo decide to take things seriously and the problem is I still can't stop laughing.
Jaya Bachchan proving as her husband Bachchan that despite of her she still one of the best actresses.
One second SRK and Preity love each other, and the next she's still getting married...Why are we not shown the process that goes in between.
I watched it a few days ago and i still have the movie running through my head.
I don't care how many times Saif plays that character, I still love him for it and I don't think I'll ever tire of seeing it.
This movie is proof of Shahrukh's emotional acting and that he still rocks.
This is a movie Bollywood had been long waiting for.... a perfect ROmantic movie with Comedy and Family values... Great ENough to entertain the entire family... Not just the American-Indians but also the Gujratis, Panjabis, Christian-Indians and all the Indian population and the Indian movie lovers.....  Kal ho na ho is a MASSIVE entertainer... i know its 3 hours long but still every minute of it is PUT to correct use.... this movie proves in every way that it is better for Hindi movies to stay Hindi with u know reasonable drama comedy songs dance and all that.I am not saying that Hindi movies should not make movies like Maqbool and other serious movies...
When Claire sees a scalpel in the pocket of Laurent's jacket, she fears him, but still loves him.
The film does not conform to the scientific method in the testing of their hypothesis (a group of peoples from the Eastern hemisphere traveling to the Americas and establishing a society)... in other words it is all opinion and proves only that there are Asian genetic markers found in what is left of the Native American population still surviving today.
He used to be Rebecka's boyfriend, and it's obvious he still has feelings for her, much to his wife Bethany's dismay.
The movie jumps back and forth between the film and the film-within-the-film and the filming-of-the-film-within-the-film (still in period costume, so you don't know at first), and from reality to hallucination.
They still have feelings and an eventual affair ensues.
Years ago, and I still got the newspaper 'cut-outs' of all the movies that Elizabeth Hurley have appeared in and they've all flopped as a result.
Even when the movie is over her involvement in them is still up in the air and unexplained to the audience by the director and writer of the movie "Method".
I bought it over 6 months ago and Im still watching it.
1 was better than 2 but I still love both and hope they bring out a third one.
The second series was a bit hard to stomach at first but was still brilliant.
Unbelievable that people will watch an "Animal Psychic" and keep her on the air for two years (and still counting), but a great show like Harsh Realm dies such a premature death.
Even now'a'days for some reason I still imitate Sweeney's little mutter of "Santiago!"
James Gandolfini is absolutely fierce, absolutely terrifying, and you still find yourself loving him - mesmerized by him.
How about the (still good) "The West Wing"?
Tony Soprano-while a mob "Capo" and suffering from mental illness, still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive.
Despite a dry-spell, I still found it (season 4 of "The Sopranos") to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that's saying a lot because lately I've been noticing a trend in good new television shows.
With out any inhibitions or contradictions I still adamantly believe that The Sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory.
But I can still feel my heart clenched in my chest, and my mind is still rolling back and forth over what I've just seen.
i enjoyed this movie.it has suspense,action,drama,and decent acting.it has a pretty dark tone to it,which i liked.while it have the same high octane adrenaline rush of "Joy Ride" which also starred Leelee Sobieski and also came out the same year,it's still pretty good in its own right.there's more of a slow build up to tension in this movie.i also think this movie demands a bit mote of its actors,especially for the the quiet dramatic moments.the cast acquit themselves fairly well here.the movie is fairly well written,though not wholly original(but there are some original elements to it)for me "The Glass House" is an 8/10
Later edit: Ah, now it's up to 5.4 - still abysmal.
Some of you might have felt they didn't really succeed but I still think they gave it their best shot.
It is a world wholly unique yet still hauntingly familiar.
While "The Matrix," released a year later, would overshadow its influence on the science fiction world and pop-culture in general, it's worth noting that the film still stands as one of the best genre films of the 90's and begs to be seen by anyone with a love for sci-fi in need of some refreshment.
When you compare this with the box office success of a film like the Matrix which while being a good film still falls well short of the tale being told in Dark City, it seems that people on the whole don't want intelligent science fiction but the typical pap that hollywood is too eager to churn out for the masses.
Unfortunately I only got to watch it on a small poor TV, but the style and plot is still captivating.
There is very little profanity in this movie but it's still an ugly, sordid story and not always fun to watch even though it keeps your attention and - at least with me - draws you back for multiple viewings.
Of course it found its audience but by then its was too late...  That said, the thirst for something better than our run of the mill pop corn fare is still there, waiting to be quenched.
At the risk of sounding like a broken record,this film is more or less a remake of Die Hard,only the skyscraper is replaced with an airplane, and our ordinary tough guy cop is replaced with the leader of the free world.Knowing this fact,it's still a good film.Harrison Ford makes a very believable president,and Gary Oldman a very convincing baddie.Although you know where the plot is going,something about it compels you to continue watching.The very fact that they are thousands of miles in the air grips me personally because I am not very fond of heights,and I found myself gripping my chair arms very tightly as a result.This is basically a "run of the mill" action flick,but still good nonetheless.
Oldman plays it like he means it, killing mercilessly while still appearing cold and calculated rather than insane.
With this in mind Air Force One hits the mark, despite some minor flaws it still delivers tension, drama and action in abundance.
Laying aside a lack of originality, and a budget too low to allow for more convincing special effects, "The Land Unknown" is still fairly good entertainment.
Brandon is a stand-out as the crazed Hunter who tries to run things his way but is still reachable and it's nice to see him regain some humanity by the conclusion of the film.
It may not be destined to be one of the classics of the period, but it's still fun of its type.
Although the special effects, prehistoric dinosaurs and scenery are not up to today's standards, it is still an excellent movie.
You will still find a very enjoyable, exciting, action, sci-fi movie.
But still, "Clockwatcher" is a good film, a unique blend of snappy humour and depressing accuracy that usually succeeds.
Though after factoring in this "film's" collection of some of the least talented "actors" (although I'm still convinced they were pulled directly from a local High School Theatre 101 class), we decided that a worse film script might be possible...but it would be impossible to purposely find a worse cast.
I don't care how absurd you want to get...cast a film entirely with drunks off the street, chimps, or computer driven AI with the sort of "Stephen Hawking" speech...it still wouldn't be as devoid of talent, as badly delivered, or as lacking of any semblance of emotion as this cast managed to do.
But what made me grit my teeth was that the opening 30 minutes was incredibly boring with its rambling teens toying around in many filler scenes that I couldn't believe I still had an hour to go.
Even if you've seen it fifty times it'll still be more exciting.
Now, most things that i liked as a child i can't stand now but i do still like this.
i liked it as a child and i still like it now at 25. probably one of the few things that have stood the test of time with me, i usually go off things very quickly.
Thsi is one of those movies that was at some point in my earlier childhood that i was obsessed with.I mean this was my favorite movie at the times.Now ill go back and look at this, and obviously I don't love it as much as I did, but I still like it a lot.This film is just so good, and so enjoyable that I can see why I liked it the way I did.Well, now that i understand the film more, i realize that there was some stuff that was not really necessary, and it was a bit to long, but its still a good movie.This movie is just so much fun, and good that its very lovable that anyone could find at least something they liked.Every now and then ill watch this, and remember why I fell in love with this great and funny movie.Overall its a good movie that can be enjoyed by anybody, and is worth a viewing from.
This and all the succeeding films made lots of money for the studio and Herbie still has plenty of life left in him as his most recent outing a year or so ago with Lindsay Lohan ought to prove.
In each one, Jones was still down on his luck but nothing like the sad figure he portrayed in Love Bug.
You have scenes involving Steve Martin as a Private Eye inter-cut with scenes from classics like Double Indemnity, The Big Sleep, The Killers and loads of other 40's classics with people like Bogie, Ava Gardner, Cary Grant, Ray Milland, Burt Lancaster (still playing the Swede) and a bunch of other stars.
Having said that, it's still interesting to see bygone legends in a completely new movie.
Incidentally, it seems there are still several minutes missing from the DVD cut.
Unfortunately, other dissimulated wars are happening still in Africa such as in Darfur and no once cares...Will it take filmmakers with a conscience to raise awareness???
The result means there are some contrived plot turns and certainly variations in the graininess of the film stock (since 1982 was still well before the enhanced computer graphics we see today), but the film is still quite a kick after a quarter-century.
Maybe "Lifeboat" wasn't Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movie, but it was still interesting.
However, it's still a great movie.
Even today more than sixty years after it was first made, Lifeboat is still a great cinematic achievement from Alfred Hitchcock.
It is not widely remembered nowadays - certainly not in the way that Psycho, North By Northwest and Rebecca are remembered - but it still ranks very highly in the director's canon.
I'm still laughing about it a few days later and am picking up a DVD tonight.
Im thinking about it now and I still feel my stomach drop when I imagine myself in Shand's shoes.
Not as complex as I've heard it made out (admittedly the DVD age means I can zip straight to the exposition scenes without effort, which helps), The Long Good Friday is still a breathtakingly audacious film and one that at times runs a real risk of alienating its audience while still retaining mass appeal.
Martin was still in his crazed, manic man phase, so the role of Rigby Reardon was something of a pleasant diversion.
But even still, its a very, very good film indeed.
In retrospect,"The Long Good Friday" has a lot to answer for;many other British filmmakers have followed it's example for nearly three decades in mostly resistible imitations,but the original has not dated much at all and is still superior to the virtually all of it's prototypes.
The Long Good Friday was and still is a great piece of British Cinema.
After watching the film after a good many years it still holds the power to shock, amuse and thrill.
Berry plays a lot of his classics - he was still an amazingly agile and robust performer at the time.
The fact that Richards is still alive at this late date is a testament to the resilience of the human body.
The Berry rifts are still fast and furious but there is now an air of cynicism that was absent at the creation.
Maybe this movie doesn't .shock., or deliver a moral message, but still it delivers a message that centers oneself to understanding itself.
=) Overall, the movie was much quicker, tighter, no serious awkward moments, still over the top as always, light hearted, and funny.
Titanic, Perfect Storm), but this movie was still loyal to the basic truths.
There is some funny dialogue and tiny moments of slapstick, even if you haven't seen the films placed in, this spoof is still one for the film buffs.
I saw it toward the end of its run, and boy am I glad I caught it while it was still in theaters.
Not that it's any big surprise that corporate interests supercede reporting/news on the boob tube, The Insider still chillingly portrays the plight of Jeffrey Wigand, ex tobacco company scientist, on his whistleblowers journey with the 60 Minutes TV Newsmagazine.
The music is superb, making clear that this is of course still a drama, and the editing, easily overlooked, creates a relentless but not distracting pace, leaving little things hanging just enough to keep us in suspense without obscuring the narrative.
We all know the outcome of the story and still the director points the story in the direction where the interview will not be broadcast, which means the tobacco industry will get away with it.
They did it here quite well, granted a lot of the time the person had their back to Steve, I still rather thought it was well done.
Though the funniest part was the scene involving the dog poop which I will admit was rather childish compared to the rest of the comedy in this film, but it still got me laughing the hardest.
when i've watched "Barda" i was expecting' a quality tension movie but i was disappointed when i saw it.instead of tension i just felt boredom.the story of the movie goes like this  a group of armed bank robbers entered to a bar after the robbery.few minutes later they took few customers in the bar as hostages and after that they begun torturing them until the night's over and cops bust in and arrest all of them  That wasn't the film which makers promised in it's trailers.Film completely filled with torture,beating,rape and murder.i still wonder how could they charge people to see a humans in the movie getting tortured,humiliated and so on.
But it is still very promising and unforgettable movie that should be really seen by any cinema lovers!
There's still " 70's stuff" everywhere and traces of the 60's, if you pay attention.
For those of us who didn't fit in in high school it's a humorous, realistic look back, and for those of you still suffering, it lets you know you're not alone.
It's just good to know that the makers of this are still out there doing the best comedies around.
"Ripple in still water...."
Paul Feig still is active in comedy and has been overshadowed somewhat unfairly because of the juggernaut that is Judd Apatow's career.
The actors were great, the scripts were great, it got rave reviews from critics, the only reason this show isn't still on is because NBC never gave it a chance.
Had they done those things I have no doubt in my mind that this show would still be on today or at least would have had more than just 16 episodes.
Like when Sam throws away his toy trucks but still decides to go trick-or-treating on Halloween.
I still think NBC passed up a good thing, and possibly other networks if it was pitched to them once being canceled.
This a good example of the kind of sophisticated comedy Charley Chase could produce while still engaging in the kind of visual humor that has him hiding from police officers in a bright raincoat on a clear night.
Ultimately, this culminates with her going to a nightclub and Charley thinks she is still hypnotized--however, try as he might, he cannot awaken her!
To be honest, I was somewhat relieved when seven days had passed and I was still alive!
It still looks quite good for a black and white film and the sound has that limited sound space effect to it to make it fit in with the older footage.
Well I still wouldn't recommend this.
One thing that strikes me is that they probably had big problems but still managed to get some of the strange mood you get from the movie "2001".
He has proved he is better than the average rapper/actor with his performances in films like TRAINING DAY and BABY BOY, though he's still not what most would consider an actual "actor".
After all, the Freddy sequels weren't as successful as the original, but still they made 'em.
I still had a lot of fun watching this movie.
In the late 70's Mr Bones does not want to be a dealer, gets killed and goes get revenge 20 years later (for reasons still unknown to men).
But, at least they did try here and there to do something a little different (both in story elements and special effects), although it was still a bad movie.
Yes, the film could have been so much more (scarier, longer and deadlier for three things), but I still enjoyed it, If nothing else, I spent a good 20 minutes chuckling at the outrageous design of the house, and I don't remember 'Kendra' being nearly so beautiful.
The conceit of setting it in a ghetto with an all-black cast promises an interesting variation on your basic "revenge from beyond the grave" scenario, but beyond the music and fashions it's still a pretty clichÃ©d film.
This film is still a very watchable and enjoyable film in my opinion, even today.
I still watch this one on occasion, and it is the rare comedy that has held up very well with the passage of time - critics at the time seemed to write it off as a stunt, but I've noted that at least a little reevaluation of DEAD MEN DON'T WEAR PLAID has occurred over the years.
The dialog gets deep into Raymond Chandler/Dashiell Hammett hard-boiled private-eye stylishness, serving up gumshoe-with-dame clichÃ©s just juiced up enough to give Steve something to run with, while still offering an a solid story.
Better still, Bresee takes a steamy shower and the exquisitely ample brunette knockout Pamela Gilbert goes skinny-dipping prior to being killed by the creature.
The acting could have been much better, I would have liked to have seen tears instead of attempts to generate them, but still the most moving of all four segments.
Yes, he obviously sounds a bit different in "Phantom..." but in POTO he's a bit older, had a lot of voice training, and his voice had matured considerably, but it's still the same voice.
I read the book afterward and noted a number of differences from the TV show but felt the show still stands as a brilliant entertainment in its own right.
It's however still a very well directed one.
Not really a that interesting movie to watch but still perfectly watchable because of how fine it's all made.
Boudreaux still loves fishing.
although it wasn't a very popular nor original film i still liked it.
From this movie I think lot of girls have learned that even if you are a stripper you still can find a perfect guy like is Julian Morris I have to say that the sex scene is so hot.
While Japanese theater has reached a new height in the west, there are still some duds to be seen.
This was a timely and bold film, also, because it dealt squarely with the oncoming invasion of the heterosexual world by AIDS at a time when most straight folk still believed themselves immune.
Each time, scheduling conflicts and studio pressure curtailed the pairings, and one can only daydream about what might have been...  "Reap the Wild Wind", the one film Duke DID make with DeMille (one of SEVEN 1942 productions he starred in), while not 'top-drawer', is still a rousing Technicolor adventure, offering another of DeMille's 'American history lessons'.
Though I would say I am pro-choice still, this movie educated me in the horrors of partial-birth abortion.
We ended up watching the film 3 times with various bits being explained to us and some of the leaders had seen it 6 times and were still noticing more about it.
The film description mentions a surprise ending, but you still won't be prepared for it; it will leave you thinking about the ramifications of this issue long after the screen goes black.
Today I still enjoy the film for its beautiful color photography, exciting sea scenes and fine performances from Ray Milland and John Wayne.
Although by today's standards the blood is pretty fake looking, it's still quite a bloody affair with slashing, stabbings - knives through body, and squirting blood.
On "Mad Dogs and Englishmen" (1995)-- "I was mad to do it, but I wanted to show the world that I was still alive and I could do other things apart from Sherlock Holmes.
The Alphabet was the epitome of a great artful film, but it still manages to leave you thinking about it.
I am still trying to figure how he pulled some of the stuff in this film off and wondering how I could do something like this myself.
I own the movie now as an adult and still adore it!
spoilers -- only parts i disliked even though they were realistically portrayed were the orphanage even though im sure thats the way it was back then for orphans.treated meanly but they at least could have listened to her when she said she wasnt an orphan.and also for the father to just leave his kid behind with the landlady who obviously is a rather loose woman .he didnt have time to watch the kid when he was around as she was always playing hooky or sneaking into movie theatres ,,although during the depression , you did what you did to survive but still he should have considered her welfare more than just to leave her like that, he didnt even say goodbye to her at the beginning of the movie when he left.
Now, about 14 years later I still love it and am looking forward to it coming out on DVD so I can own it.
The love story between Natty and Harry is so romantic, and the independent spirit of a young girl was rare in movies back then and is still rare now.
Also this was probably the first time I saw John Cusak in anything (although still my favorite film of his is "Better Off Dead").
His was a name that brought in the public and their money when Capra was still a 'gag man' for Mack Sennett.
I want to watch it again to see if I still like it as much, but I know I probably will ...
Despite the many Disney clichÃ©s it avoids, it's still always obvious Natty will find her father and all will be happy.
However, enough is enough and he starts to fight back At that point, Tom gets brutalized but Jerry still gets it, too.
"Dressed to Kill," "Body Double"), it is still, nevertheless, extremely well-crafted and never seems to be overcome by DePalma's indulgent tendencies.
I've seen this at least six times since childhood and I still think it is great.
This movie just reeks of farce, from the accountant mowing down people with a shotgun with the nerdy grin symbolizing his transformation from mild mannered nerd to empowered bad-ass to the completely arbitrary scene of Robert DeNiro hitting a guy with a baseball bat (no back story,no plot movement, seemingly no reason for it to be in the movie whatsoever)to Sean Connery getting blasted with seemingly dozens of machine gun bullets, bleeding enough to have died three times over, and yet still having the power to gasp a few more words just as Elliot Ness gets there before finally dying.
I understand that they had limits because it was an account of a true story, but they still could have told us certain things and saved some things for later.
Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph.
Now that I'm a bit older, I still enjoy the film a lot, just not as much as I used to.
It's a perfect part for Connery, whose rugged appearance and demeanor are entirely convincing; he's got that somewhat cynical, world-wise and weary manner of a man who has seen it all, but lets you know that underneath he still holds out hope that some day in some way, right will win out after all.
Charles Martin Smith does a good job as well and even though his character is very limited he still manages to pull the audience in.
She would have quickly become a real 'it' girl -- hopefully she still will.
The color of technicolor still holds up [not used that often in the 40s].
You've got potential complicated relationships -- a young cutie guy who hits on all the bikini babes he can, finds out he's a lost prince, becomes an unselfish do-gooder when he'd rather party while still wanting to solve the disappearance of his mother.
It's still #1 on i-Tunes, and it's been 5 days already.
I would hope by its success on i-Tunes that there's still a chance for this show come mid-season.
i think the Bernie mac is one of the greatest comedies ever, Bernie always talking negative about the kids and how much trouble they are but the show seems to teach morals while still being funny at the same time.
I'll conclude now with the not-too-deep (but still very pertinent) observation that Kellita Smith, the actress who plays Bernie' wife, is really gorgeous.
It's just so good, I wish it was still in production so I could see more of it.
It was done really well all around, and it was one of those episodes that amazed my once I recovered from my temporary (it is still only TV) emotional immersion in the story.
Having said all this, there is still so much more I would want to say.
His last film of this period was "Invisible Stripes," a lesser Warner Bros. gangster film that still offers much.
Anyway, while not in the same rarefied league of such Warners gangster flix as "Angels With Dirty Faces" and "The Roaring Twenties," this Bogey outing is still lots of fun.
It would be another few years until 1941's "High Sierra" and "The Maltese Falcon" really made the world see him in a new light, but "Invisible Stripes" was still a highly entertaining vehicle for his ever-growing talent.
Only one cheat at a chapter ending, where you see Zorro fall from a building, but the next chapter shows him still hanging there.
Though not the same caliber as Zorros Fighting Legion, this is still a top notch serial,well worth viewing.
Well, much of the movie is spent trying to win her back, though he still wonders whether or not to rob his "friends".
Even so, at just over 220 minutes it would be advisable to show/see this version in two parts, or - better still - show/see the full original 1984 uncut TV series in its natural episodes of approximately 1 hour each.
I hate to be a spoilsport, and would not wish to hurt the feelings of the Portuguese director, aged 100 this year (assuming he is still alive), but this is really a terrible film.
Every person was fake and corny except the girl and the priest (who still ended up speaking as if he was rehearsing for a Guide du Routard film.
Unfortunately he has never again done something as good as Aniki Bobo, his first real film, and now that he's at the "reverting back to a child" age he probably never will, still he deserves respect.
I'm sorry I would like to write more coherently and longer but my emotional body is still quivering from the impact of this fantastic movie - a jarring metaphor of what has become of our history, effortlessly gliding with unstoppable eloquence.
It's incredible how this director still creative is... His stories are simple and deep.
This filmed talked to me, while i could do nothing but sit still and wait and listen and watch and then give one of the most sincere applauses i ever could give to a movie.
Were it not for Hattons' presence (sadly, this was his last picture), this would still be watchable but pretty forgettable.
No, "The Brute Man" is not nearly in the same league as those two immortal classics, but still remains a fine entertainment nevertheless.
It's hard to feel much sympathy for Rondo's "Creeper" character, cold-blooded psycho that he has become, but somehow, we DO still feel some, to the actor's great credit.
It is rare for any film to present so human a portrait of a villain and still succeed in warning the audience so effectively.
It's hard to imagine them having to be funny on film for the next several years while seeing Curly waste away, or during 1956 having to pretend the late Shemp was still filming with them.
Enjoyable little film about friendship, the fun and pains of growing up, and incidently, growing up on the streets of New York; Though not for everybody, this is still engaging to watch.
It's still one of my all-time faves & whenever I catch it on TV, I still have to watch it, all these years later.
But i still recommend this as rollicking fun for everyone who loves mutant new wave girlies on motorcycles etc.
And if you ignore the comedy for a moment, there is a message and a question in this which is still unanswered, as it has been for hundreds of years (compare to the Streets of New York).
The best part of the movie is when he tells the prison guard, Phil,says "Rudy, you still owe me $100!"
I watched this show all the time as a child, and my unbelievable memory is even today still capable of pulling up a memory of seeing the Polkaroo on stage when I was only 1 or 2 years old.
The 1930's costumes are impeccable and make you wish you could have lived then, when men still knew how to wear suits, and women could look feminine and sexy without looking trashy.
I'm sure I would have liked this movie slightly more if I had not read the book, but I still wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
When still at the top of his game Mortmain and his then wife (who later dies, no foul play here) and his two little girls stumbled upon a rodent infested castle which he leased.
Jump quite a bit ahead to a now remarried Mortmain who lives in the still unrestored castle with his new, young, artist wife, Topaz (the beautiful, funny and accomplished Tara Fitzgerald) and his two teenage daughters, an appropriately mischievous little son and a sort of retainer in farm clothes, young Stephen.
Not to mention that I don't like the fact that he tried to make her sympathetic, I'm sorry, just she did still kill these men.
I know there are a lot of sick people out there, I don't think she did it for pleasure, but still acting upon what she did was just wrong.
Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer is a good documentary, don't get me wrong, this was still incredible and I'm glad that he was able to get these interviews with Aileen.
I am not sure why - it isn't any much funny, the plot is unnecessarily complicated, there are few unnecessarily long scenes ... but still, the characters, the atmosphere, and the great musical score almost made me cry in the last scene where our three heroes are leaving together.
If you want a terrible horror movie but still want to be entertained, check out my personal favorites 'Rodentz' and 'Screaming Dead'.
It was still enjoyable though and is fairly fun to watch.
I saw this movie on Sci-Fi channel so I'm sure I missed out on the best of the nudity and gore but I was still fascinated by it.
The film's antagonists, though much more normal (with one notable exception), may not be as weirdly entertaining as the film's bizarre protagonists, but they are well-acted (they have to be, since they don't have a gimmick to fall back on) and still great characters (they just have incredible protagonists to contend with!
He leaves and she still looks for, everybody now, the swarthy Mediterranean type with one heck of a schnoz.
Mind you, after reading the rave reviews from other fellow IMDb viewers, I don't find this one the "cream of the crop" of B-Horror films, it has the same standard elements of B-Horror films such as graphic gore, OK Acting, and contrived (although still fun) occurrences throughout the movie.
"I, Madman" didn't knock me out of my socks, but it is still a gem for the horror genre fans to check out and have fun with.
I first saw this movie a year after it came out, it was 1989, i was 14, and i have never been so scared in my life, I've just watched it again, and while its still scary i am now 32.
The only thing that i found fault with, was the murder scenes were not that gory, (apart from the redhead)but still it was very atmospheric and sinister, and you won't be disappointed if you watch it.
The first kill is a cracker and sadly the later ones aren't as good, but they still just about work in the context.
How a character from a novel can suddenly become real isn't explained that well but the story felt solid still & it didn't really matter to me that much as I, Madman just seemed work.
A bit of a sleeper & I highly recommend I, Madman to horror fans, as for everyone else I still think it's a worthwhile film & definitely worth watching.
In 1975 I was still in the army.
Several elderly married couples, church-goers and devout Christians, discuss having gay or lesbian children, and how this has changed their perceptions of what they've been taught--and what they're still being told--by Evangelical Fundamentalists who use their interpretations of scripture to condemn homosexual love.
Millions of people still don't get it, however, and these are the viewers this film needs to reach.
If wishes could come true, then everyone would watch this film with an open mind if only to find out if afterward, they were still willing to throw the first stone of "righteousness".
But yet they all still overcame their own prejudices, some longer than others, and it's very beautiful to watch.
And still the film doesn't degrade Christianity in any way, and although I'm far from a Christian myself I found that to be very refreshing.
For too many still gay is something where emotion kicks in and reason just flies out the door.
Second, while the ending was stolen from William Castle's film THE TINGLER, it still was a good ending for this exploitation film--and ending this dreck on a positive note.
The "red herring" climax is overlong and, despite its short running time, there are still way too many boring moments in the script.
The ending is laughably absurd; it MIGHT have worked in 1940, or 1876, and it might scare little four year olds who are still afraid of the bogeyman and have parents who try to keep them well-behaved by using his appearance as a threat, but for teenagers or adults, it's "Oh, Jesus" lame.
But these are men who hold to their illusions with a death-grip; one guy still wants to have long rock star hair though he's basically bald on top, which is a metaphor for how these guys avoid facing the truth; that they are not great filmmakers waiting to be discovered, but rather mere obsessives with eroded imaginations.
For me, a novice, I still found it well worth watching.
That still doesn't stop him from cleaning the streets up from gangs and other lowlife scum.
The pace is a little bit too slow for an early 70s "cop" flick, but it's still above-average and a good find.
Things aren't a lot different in 2006,it's just that Hollywood likes to make us think they are.I'm not saying for a minute that it's right that things have barely changed in 30 years,but no amount of wishing will make it so.Professional criminals still hide their activities behind the poor and disenfranchised of their own communities,ferment trouble for their own advantage and cops like Eddie Ryan still hate them bitterly for doing it.Laws meant to protect the weak and vulnerable still shelter the cruel and ruthless.If Eddie Ryan,like Harry Callaghan before him,feels like chucking in his badge then he cannot altogether be blamed.Not that he gets a chance as his bosses pre-empt him.
Though what we call "a gangster film" in the 1970's bears little resemblance to the classics of the 1930's, it is still a film about big-time criminals and organized crimeÂ Only the baddies have been changed to assist identificationÂ   "Badge 373" is a case in pointÂ It is a simple story, based on the exploits of Eddie Egan, a real New York policeman who also, for good measure, plays a part in the filmÂ  Ryan, a New York detective, is suspended for causing the death of a Puerto Rican dope runnerÂ Taking a job as a bartender, he learns that his old partner on the force has been killedÂ Then, with the law against him because he is no longer a policeman, and harassed also by the villains, he sets out to avenge his friend's murderÂ  The twist is that these villains are no longer liquor and heroin smugglers, big-time gamblers or bank robbersÂ They are Puerto RicansÂ Some of them are men who seek to foment a revolution on their island; others, led by a sinister figure in dark glasses called Sweet William, are the crooked element who will supply the necessary guns and ammunitionÂ Ryan, played by Robert Duvall, wages his own solitary war against both partiesÂ  It's a rough, tough and ruthless film, in which Duvall is as brutal as his adversaries; towards the end, he callously chops down a night watchman in order to gain entrance to the Brooklyn docksÂ In fact, it is very difficult to have sympathy for any of the characters in "Badge 373."
I am still baffled at how this kind of crap gets backing and then money is spent to promote it, and then it's distributed, etc.
My eyes still burn.
I like stupid movies, but the movie still needs to be entertaining.
It may mean more to people who are from that period; Crumb is still a legend in the underground comic-book/art scene, not quite breaking into a 'mainstream' but still with his immense cult.
The comics weren't in the best condition, a tear here and there, but they still held up pretty well.
When they show up at his mother's house where his brother Charles still lives, the movie takes on a different feel.
I still don't like underground comics, but this movie helped me understand them...to a degree.
There are some disaffecting matters here though, particularly the patronising of the southern negro, all "yes'm'" and "clap yo' hands" - even if this is the way old Dixie treated its coloured inhabitants it's still painful to view the coarse stereotyping.
A very good film that still holds up well today.
The terror of the yellow fever is also excellently conveyed, and the images of countless bodies being carted away is still very powerful.
Although not nearly as historically accurate as it could've been, the 1938 version of "Marie Antoinette" still stands as one of the best films of the 1930s and certainly the finest ever made about the late queen of France.
It is lavish, staggering grandeur that perfectly represents the golden days of Hollywood and I am sure it still will attract and amaze the viewers many years from now.
By this time Morley has come around enough to give Shearer two children, from whom she is of course eventually separated, giving the audience a reason for still more tears.
As for Power... remember the anecdote about the reporter asking romance-writer Barbara Cartland (Lady Di's stepmother) how she could possibly have written so many romance novels before she was even married and while she was still a virgin?
The costumes tread a fine line between historical accuracy (covered shoulders and revealed cleavage) and the requirements of the movie code (exposed shoulders were tolerated but bosoms had to be covered) but still manage to convey the era and the fairy-tale quality of Marie's court.
No matter, it's still a spectacle for sore eyes.
Power was the inspiration for Barbara Cartland to say, when asked how she could write so convincingly about sex while she was a still a virgin, "We didn't need sex.
As a young actress still in her 20s, Norma Shearer was hailed as the First Lady of MGM, and she reigned as queen of the studio throughout the 1930s.
Film is dated (NY has gotten much safer since this came out) but is still powerful.
Before I saw Death Wish, I knew there was more than just the context of it being a starring vehicle for one of the major bad-asses of the action picture, Charles Bronson (who's best role is still the one with the least words, Once Upon a Time in the West), and that it contains the elements that would spark an entire sub-genre (for better or worse).
Death Wish is a film of its time, but one that still has significance, and entertainment value for today.
The film becomes better still as the police find themselves under pressure with the recent vigilante killings, and the media report that once helpless victims are fighting back against their attackers inspired by this new rebel.
The original Death Wish movie is still the only one worth watching.
It starts with a chilling rape sequence - still provocative thirty years on - and develops from there into an exciting and perversely funny story of how a man whose life is affected by these disturbing events gets his revenge.
The sense of humour really helps the film (I still laugh at the scene where some construction-workers kick the hell out of a crook, and one workman nonchalantly states to the TV reporters: "Erm, we roughed him up a bit before the cops arrived!")
Death Wish was a pretty influential film for its era, and in spite of its dated air and its morally dubious stance, it is still a great flick.
It still kept me interested throughout and made me more interested in viewing more of the star's other films--good or otherwise.
This is one of the most famous "revenge" movies ever made and still stands up today.
However, the early scene of the mother and daughter raped and killed is still horrifying.
But the streets are still filled with thugs, and Kersey knows that Manhattan is not the best place to be at night.
It's at once fascinating, and still very timely.
But still then, beside this the whole story became a sweet and funny love story.
Yes, we can't say that after hours is the best of Scorsese because, well Scorsese has a lot of classics, but still After hours is a masterpiece, and a must see for all and not only for Scorsese's fans.
She has been kind of lost since then but the way she plays totally clueless and still manipulative is really superb.
Perfect flawless black comedy with humor as dark as the night that caught Paul Hacket (Griffin Dunne), a nice guy, an everyman, an ordinary computer operator in its darkness and surrounded him by all kinds of weird strangers who very well could be the deadly creatures of night that inhabited SOHO of early 1980s every night after hours... or perhaps they are still there?
I do not know how many times I have seen this movie along my life, maybe ten times, but it still attracts me and now I have just seen it for the first time on DVD.
Arquette plays Marcy just right, a girl who is just short of being completely unhinged, but who still stumbles ahead smoothly and confidently if not a good bit clueless-ly.
She plays her character of Julie, aka Jezebel with a quite reserve, showing that still waters do run deep.
The genetically altered Brutha goes on a murder rampage but his endearing wife still doesn't give up on him.
But there's still romance there nontheless.
He's a bit deaf, a bit slow, a bit more crotchety but he's still that one moral man walking down "these mean streets" of L.A.  Benton has done some extraordinary work, but this is his elevation to the sublime, a movie that one can watch again and again.
And she is still cute as can be Winnie!
Bette Davis is Julie and while she's going to be married to the very proper Henry Fonda, she likes the idea that she can still turn the head of every young blade in New Orleans.
My eyes are still recovering from this painful experience.
The film wouldn't have kept the glorious look it still possesses, had it been shot in color.
Even though a lot of the effects in this film still involve the "man-in-a-suit-a-saurus" style of monster, they are excellent!
In fact, I hadn't been entertained like this since TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA (Toho; 1975), and despite the movie's MAJOR flaws, GODZILLA 2000: MILLENNIUM is still very entertaining.
The US version is still fun to sit through, and still manages to have respect for the original film.
Come evening, Katagiri even suggested blowing up the building with the UFO still on it (where a crazy mix-up gets Shinoda into DIE HARD-style hijinks), but guess what?
Well, I still think that the next Godzilla movie, GODZILLA X MEGAGUIRUS: THE G ANNIHILATION STRATEGY, is even better, and that it was the type of movie Toho should've made (and the movie that should've been shown in US theaters)!
Slightly on the predictable side and with some (too)big coincidences but still a very good effort by Michael Chrichton.
Despite those reservations this is still a grand film to watch.
Buck Cantrell (George Brent) is Julie's former beau, who remains a family friend and still defends Julie's honor.
I think that even when the film was made, (1938) the lines were still blurred as to how many freedoms and how much free-thinking should be afforded to women.
The First Great Train Robbery wasn't the first by any means but definitely still stands as a great heist film that has eye catching period detail, a good solid plot & a great cast.
Donald Sutherland was a bit over the top, but still quite enjoyable to watch.
In this one ALL the lead actresses take their clothes off, and two of the guys too (I could have done without the hairy ass shot).The alien creature was very funny looking, not scary at all, the effects were somewhat poor, but I still love this film.
The first-rate deluxe Special Edition DVD by Image Entertainment offers a fairly grainy, but generally solid and up to par widescreen presentation loaded with a wonderful wealth of awesomely abundant extras which include the theatrical trailer, a still and poster gallery, funky animated menus complete with songs and music from the picture, screen tests, bloopers and rehearsals (the bloopers in particular are an absolute hoot), pre-production footage and storyboards, animation test footage and work print outtakes, and, most savory of all, a very funny, entertaining and informative commentary provided by Kanefsky along with various cast and crew members.
Even though my kids are getting older they still enjoy watching this movie, and I do too.
Although maybe over-titled in the sense there are only 4 criminals, it's still a solid story which is well directed, acted and photographed.
Good call there... NOT  Gore: plenty but still not enough.
Tony Todd is still cool and he's not overused as in the previous sequel but with such awful material it's hard to shine.
'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers', 'A Nightmare On Elm Street 2', 'Childs Play 3', and 'Candyman 3' all have something in common.If you're thinking that they're all sequels, you are right, but there's something else.All of these movies are examples of underrated sequels.I liked all of these movies and I don't care what other people have to say about them.I thought that 'Candyman 3: Day of the Dead' was a pretty decent horror movie with another groundbreaking performance by Tony Todd.Nobody will ever play a better Candyman than him.That's a fact that we horror fans should know.I haven't seen the 2nd movie yet, but I do have to say that the first and the third were pretty good.Maybe the third wasn't as good as the first, but I still found it to be a good movie.After you're finished reading my review, I want you to go to a mirror and say Candyman 5 times.If he shows up and tries to kill you, then it serves you right for thinking that this movie was totally pointless.If the Candyman franchise wants to be really popular, then there needs to be a 4th installment.Let's hope that Tony Todd is willing to play Candyman again.
But you have to remember the movie didn't cost that much and was shot in three weeks.Tony Todd is good as Candyman and seems even more evil than he was in the last two movies.Even though the movie is less scary than the other two, Todd himself is still as frightening as before.The movies story is good, probably one the best ever in a horror movie.
Caroline, the great great grand daughter of Candyman, is still haunted by the dreams of what her family and Candyman had to go through.
No one believes her of course that he is still real, Candyman is back though and he is murdering her friends one by one while she gets the blame.
There's quite a few good artistic touches in this movie, but in the end it's still a very low low budget video.
That poor man: what is he still doing with someone who so clearly does not understand him!
I loved the book and still do but I feel that the film is a massive letdown.
But it's still an intelligent rendition of a story that could easily have been butchered; and a modest success.
The film has an impressive use of the camera,with inventively flashy visuals here-and-there and still shots that skillfully add to the tension of the story.This is complimented with a clever use of soundtrack that further revs up the story some notches.
The boy is still in the basket, and the doctor hangs on until he's too high to let go.
Sams is able to provide emotional momentum when the film otherwise cannot (see below), but it still perfectly fits the austere atmosphere.
For big fans of Errol and big fans of period romance musical comedy/drama combo,this movie will deliver the goods.The story hits the spot for the genre.Very good music,very good cast and acting as well.What kpt this movie from becoming a classic though was the low budget and average directing.The cinematography was also below average.But still,Errol Flynn is so charming here as usual and for the right audience,it's still a winner.This film was unfairly under rated due to the dreaded anti-Flynn syndrome bandwagon......
And even when its bad, its still pizza."
The Gershwin score is minor Gershwin, but still enjoyable.
Like minor Marx Brothers or minor Van Gogh etchings, they are still better than most people's best.
Some of the ideas from that time still resonate these days, although there is no comparison.
I like the pictures, there are characters you can identify it and still: The film is not going anywhere, it's just moving along.
After the time is up, still nothing has happened.
Now, I could keep talking about this for hours and still I would have to say more.
In fact there are many teenagers out there who are rather intelligent, mature and wise beyond their years yet still like their basic humour associated with other peoples demise, which in this film, is done amazingly well and it is quite relatable when we see Enid and Rebecca laughing at the "satanists" in the diner.
I would say apart from the great style and culture of the movie, its still great; acting, characters, story, ending, everything.
Worst still, its very, very cheap; you can tell this by the vast amount of fog pumped into every frame to cover the lack of extras.
If the answer is yes, then a bad story is still pretty good.
The story involving a girl who does not die during the twenty-minute gassing and is then revived and how the men argue over how to protect her from further harm, is intense and touching in that it shows the humanity that is still in their souls.
Developed as The City is Dark and shot as Don't Cry, Baby before being released as Crime Wave, Andre de Toth's still surprisingly tough police procedural is a film that wears its economy as a badge of pride.
Offered a big budget and a 35-day shooting schedule if he made it with Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner, de Toth held out for Sterling Hayden even though it mean a fraction of the budget and a 15-day shooting schedule Â and still managed to come in ahead and shoot the film in only 13 days.
The plot is simple enough: a trio of escaped cons (Ted de Corsia, Charles Bronson when he was still Charles Buchinsky and Ned Young) kill a cop when robbing Dub Taylor's gas station for eating money and involve innocent parolee Gene Nelson, leaned on by cops and crooks alike, in their escape plans.
To anyone who does feel this way I would say that these reminders must never stop until there is peace throughout the world, Firstly because there are still many, many atrocities still occurring in this world which must be addressed, and those responsible must be brought to book and the free world must jointly do everything in their power to put an end to these regimes.
Secondly, Although it is over 60 years since the horrors were first brought to the attention of the world, there are millions who were not born or know nothing or very little about how the human race can be, and still are, so cruel and evil against its fellow man.
This takes a bit away from the searing dramatic effect of the film, but it is still a must-see movie for anyone interested in the history of the Holocaust.
When I saw the first few minutes of this film, and those horrible buildings and the piles of ash that were still there when I visited, it brought everything back, but told a story I didn't know much about.
But another Jewish leader is still planning on escape, arguing that he has every right to expect to live.
However, in the heart of this film there is a very sincere, very respectable tribute to the golden-age superhero, and I feel that the movie is still very much worthy of praise.
Once the Red Skull realizes that Cap is still alive, he determines that the hero must be out to destroy him.
In a film which emphasized overacting, he probably has the sublest role, yet he still has the film's best over-the-top lines ("Assassination isn't worth the trouble.
While never released to theaters here in the U.S., it made the theaters, perhaps ironically, overseas and, as a result, built the bridge for the bigger-budgeted, more-serious Marvel Superhero movies that came years later and are still to come.
He is preserved there until the 1990's, when he get resurrected and he realizes Red Skull is still alive and healthy, because the serum has allowed him to last this long.
Cap must stop him before it is too late, and at the same time, he must come to grips with the fact that he is in a strange new world and everything he has ever known in gone forever, and that if it hadn't been for him failing to defeat Skull the first time, many people would still be alive.
You still have the chance to release a 50th anniversary edition this year!
Mostly it's pretty dull, but still somehow quite watchable.
Captain America goes after the Red Skull beating up Nazi soldiers then totally gets beaten up by the skull that doesn't look like a skull, but it is still creepy.
The skull is still around and he now looks like a guy with a bad sunburn and he is trying to kidnap the Pres.
movies, the end results are still the same.
He directed only one other noir: Pitfall, another great film that we are still waiting to see on DVD.
Though it runs only seventy-five minutes, it still seems remarkable that Buster Keaton's fertile imagination is built upon short, quick gags that pass by quickly--so quickly that it staggers the mind that anyone could come up with enough to flesh out seventy-five minutes.
The wrecked train in the film is still visible today in the river where it sank in the film, somewhere in Tennesseee, I believe.
Still, although The Navigator and Sherlock Jr. were excellent, they still don't quite measure up to Keaton's crowning achievement.
This film obviously had a huge budget, so studios still invested heavily in silent film, but Keaton knew what was coming.
He has that kinetic tension that allows a still face and form to enthrall, like Clint, Benicio, Brando.
Soon, he is behind enemy lines still chasing.
Granted, I still admit that I prefer the silent clowns in shorts, because it can be a bit exhausting to watch them in an entire feature, especially since they are often strings of vignettes thrown together and my modern brain prefers to edit out everything that's unnecessary, but some of the joy in these films is found in those very moments.
It's nothing fantastic like some of his other films, but it's still funny.
It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesn't get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context.
Then we move into a second extraneous, but still amusing, story regarding a battle between the North and the South that could've been excised and still having a decent, though simple, story.
But despite the age it shows, it still holds up as an enjoyable work from one of cinema's greatest physical comedians.
The actual locomotive is still in existence in a museum in the south.
Annabelle, a passenger herself, was still on board.
I won't bother you with a detailed plot, all you really need to know is what is expressed in the opening scenes, that this man loves only two things in life, his General (the train) and his woman (who is not very likeable but still drives Buster throughout the film.)
Even if you never seen it first time its still an enjoyable watch, but just remember it was shot on a 70's TV show budget (a UK one at that) so its not a major production.
It is hours and hours of footage, and even after you have gorged yourself on it, there is still more!
... Give or take a few hours of course but I still have vivid memories of this ultimate concert .
Major disappointment aside I still stayed in to watch the rest of the concert most of which I watched on my sister's portable black and white TV and it wasn't until a few days later that I started digesting what a monumental event it was where Queen stole the show with their medley , where Bob Geldof swore live on air ( In those days bad language on television was still very rare ) , the dominance of British music that saw every act at Wembly hail from the British Isles and where a third of the acts at the American concert were also British , and the strange fact within a couple of years many of the acts at Wembly had disappeared from the charts altogether .
As I was and still very much so a big fan of The Who, I wasn't a Mod, and knowing that they had "retired" this would be or could be the only chance to get to see them.
The Wembley Live Aid concert ticket stub is still in good condition in the photo album.
The pacing is fair, but the film too often seems to stand still.
The directorial style of Pusher is still there, and this is what makes the film enjoyable and watchable.
But even still, this concert is fantastic.
The Egyptian and this, The Prodigal,were designed to get the movie theaters seats filled with a public who could and are still,see the the same plot lines in the comfort of their living room/bedrooms.
It was truly one of his most memorable roles to date, and I think that only further opened my eyes to the still untapped talent he possess.
But still, "Explorers" is a lot of fun on many levels, especially if you're a Joe Dante fan.
I first saw Explorers when I was 6, not long after the movie came out and still remains a film that can be watched again.
Even though this under rated movie by Joe (Gremlins) Dante is for kids I still love watching it and it fulfills all kids dreams who look up at the stars and wonder what the heck is out there.
Explorers may have an odd ending, but I still feel it's a high point in Dante's career, and it's refreshing to see a kids film with a modicum of intelligence.
Remarkably the film still holds up well even though it's a movie primarily aimed at children, however the film is really brought down by the third act.
And now fifteen years later, I still believe it.
And now fifteen years later, I still believe it.
In fact, whenever I see it on now I still enjoy it.
Maybe "Explorers" isn't anything special, but it's still pretty fascinating.
Credited as the earliest complete feature-length American film known to still exist and restored by the American Film Institute, 'The Life and Death of King Richard III' is otherwise of little value.
i saw it when i was pretty young and absolutely loved it, as i do much of Dante's flicks from this time - The Burbs, Gremlins, InnerSpace - and i still love it to this very day.
it was over all very creepy, but a little predictable, still really good.
Proof that Hooper does still have what it takes to make a genuinely good horror film, "Toolbox Murders" delivers good chills for a solid 95 minutes.
Nonetheless, it's still a film you can watch superficially, enjoying the many mysteries that Hooper and his writers treat us to.
While the name of Tobe Hooper does not carry the cachet it once did, he still deserves his place amongst the modern masters of horror with the likes of Romero, Argento, Craven, and Cronenberg.
Fortunately, it's creepy atmosphere and the high tension it creates almost make up for this big flaw, although it is still noticeable.
Indeed, this 1912 film manages to condense the play neatly and still retains much of the power of the piece without hearing - or even reading - the words.
Oh, I pine for the days when that mighty Viking, the Swedish Chef, still roamed Scandinavia, stamping out all such crap with one swing of his frying pan.
If you still do not get the point...maybe this movie IS something for YOU anyway...  What is even worse is this movie is made in my Home Country.
In interviews just before his death, Lennon said he "couldn't even talk about" things like the band's breakup "because it is still in court."
Phantom Raiders was the second (the first being 1939 Nick Carter - Master Detective) and the last film directed by Jacques Tourneur about the adventures of a popular detective Nick Carter whose character was created still in the end of the 19th century and who served as a protagonist of several films before this one during the silent era.
A little weaker than its predecessor - Nick Carter-Master Detective, The Phantom Raiders is still a decent viewing experience.
One other note: Allen Klein, the Beatles' ex-business manager, must still cast a mighty fearsome shadow.
Let's see.. in a large bowl, mix together effortless acting, extremely overlit sets, a made-for-tv, afterschool special script, cliches about how all men are either pigs or ineffectual and all women know what they want, obligatory, gap-filling scenes involving an easy listening pop tune where all the major characters get to dance together and, finally, the inevitable soft ending where the world gets back  together, somewhat changed but somehow still the same, and you'll have this  "home ec" project of a film.
Her most unwatchable movie is still watchable to me on a snowy Sunday afternoon such as today.
Some might complain that they can probably see how the story would develop as it wore on, but you have to admit that Adrian Alonso's charismatic Carlitos will still have you engaged throughout with that cherubic face of his, brimming with faith and confidence.
None the less, this movie is still well-done.
Maria Rojo had a minor role, I hadn't seen anything with her since Danzon and I still have a fan-crush.
If you are strongly against illegal immigration, I still recommend watching the film.
So even if you are against the characters crossing the border illegally, the movie still won't disappoint.
Eugenio Derbez in particular, does an amazing job as the hardened sidekick who discovers his heart might still be open to caring.
Elsewhere, in Mexico, her nine-year-old son still sleeps soundly in his bed.
He cannot reconcile his mother's love still felt in his heart and the reality of their situation.
While Rosario's daily renunciation is a testament to conviction and hope, Carlito's mission to make his way from Mexico to L.A. gives the film a heartbreaking tenderness while still tersely telling the truth of his tale.
Now I have seen more than my shares of bad acting in low budget movies, but Dorothy's acting although rough around the edges, still have more room to grow, that is, if she was to allow to develop her skill.
So if that's the single most mind blowing and fascinating concept you've ever heard of, then you probably still shouldn't bother watching this because it's not like they explain it.
These two gals wind up in forgotten Hawaiian isles where WW II was fought with the Japs and there still remained a single person who was still fighting the world and had regrets over having killed American's during the war.
This is an issue that still gets little attention from the media.
Kudos to the writer and director for addressing one of the several crises (including health care and prison reform) that are still in shambles today.
The 3rd women, whose name was never released is still in jail.
The beautiful thing about Martin is that he can be absurd in almost any role he plays and still be likable and funny because of that very absurdity.
But I'm still giving this an 8.
This movie is from the period when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin were still at the very top of the comedy-genre.
Therefor the move never really reaches the level of true greatness but it still is a bit of a forgotten and certainly underrated comedy that deserves some more recognition.
Since I fancied myself as a Steve MArtin fanatic(still kinda do),I felt like I HAD to see this.
While I would've never--not then,probably not now,either--thought this to be anything of great work,it's still a blissfully wonderful comedy.
The fed assigned him Barney Coopersmith(Rick Moranis,mensch)seems to be woefully unable to keep a leash on his charge,but it's alright because while Vinnie may not sit still in protective custody,he's got a big heart for those around him keeping him out of prison.
Naturally,while Vinnie may not be always above board about his actions,he's still pretty good on his word and intentions.
still had a somewhat heavy air in them,albeit still largely tongue-in-cheek).
Instead, it is a joyful little flick that knows it is no Oscar winner but still tries to entertain its audience.
Woody Allen did all but direct this film, which is why it sometimes misses lists of his best films, the truth is he had moved on to another project while it was still a stage show, and such is his desire to create, he didn't want to go back too directing.
Woody Allen was still in his first phase as a director, not having gone into his Igmar Bergmann period yet.
If you love old movies, or great comedy, or Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in their early prime, then PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM will still deliver the goods 30+ years after its first release.
While the film obviously lacks the emotional depth and improvisational style of Allen's later films (the obvious comparison being 1977's "Annie Hall" starring the same three leads), it still has a quaint charm to go with its romantic comedy conventionality.
If someone from China like me who is still learning English can get this movie, I AM SURE you guys who like the style of Woody Allen, will totally dig it.
But I still like it very much.
Replace Sam and Dean with me and my accountant brother and still the episode would be believable.
Personally I loved "Supernatural" ever since the pilot, but it's still very encouraging and stimulating to see how the show gets better with each and every episode!
But, it still has some cute moments.
But, still, it's a cute moment.
As did many of the Astaire/Rogers films, 'Roberta' proved successful with audiences because it consciously defied the woeful economic conditions in which the United States still found itself.
I'm still thinking about this movie, 15 years later, after seeing it at a local art film movie house in Ann Arbor.
I watched it until I was 15 when it was canceled, and still thoroughly enjoyed it.
But still a thrill ride.
It is still interesting to watch though.
The writers, in my perspective, are getting pretty desperate.. Too bad The Simpsons are still on instead of Futurama.
(don't get me wrong, I still like The Simpsons but.. Futurama > The Simpsons.. am I right or am I right :])  Anyway, I regret ignoring this awesome cartoon, only soon to realize this might as well be the best cartoon airing on T.V.
They cancelled it, which is a real shame because this show still had tons of potential left in it.
People have flown to the edge of the universe (literally; there's a billboard and everything), created robots that run on alcohol, and turned the internet into a virtual reality realm, and yet lonely guys still rent porno on Saturday night.
The writers of the show admitted that the first movie was terrible and said that they are still finding the right way to do futurama movies (1 movie, 4 episodes) and they have succeeded.
One of the few cartoons still on that both children and adults can watch is The Simpsons, a past one is Futurama.
Unlike South Park, or Family Guy (both great shows by the way) Futurama was still very funny, without sex or political jokes.
I don't think I've seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it.
Although it may not be as good as the Simpsons it is still a fantastic comedic cartoon.
Although it may not be as good, it's still great.
This is one great show, if you don't already watch it, id suggested start watching it, there still making new episodes and there classic!
(The movies were awful, admittedly) But whatever the case, I am still so pleased that it is finally coming back.
As far as it being on Comedy Central, at least it is still on the air.
The outcome may or may not be satisfactory to some, including myself but it was still entertaining, although I certainly could see it going the other way.
It seems farfetched because many people were still struggling after the depression.
But she is still almost all Harlow, and they go as far as they possibly could under the Production Code.
It goes without saying that the best Myrna Loy movies have William Powell - but this movie has enough cast that it can virtually throw away Jimmy Stewart and still carry you along with the strength of the character performances.
Anyone who has ever enjoyed a Marilyn Monroe movie is simply watching second best - Harlow was the original "blonde bombshell" - and is still the best.
Errol Morris's documentary isn't still another Bush-bashing fiesta.
The resulting movie shows the whole to be somewhat less than the sum of its parts, but it's still worthwhile for the talent involved in the production.
I am aware that the answers to these questions would stretch the format the director has chosen for this documentary, but I still believe that Errol Morris should have looked more openly into these territories in order to have made an even bolder film; and bold, courageous and very well made this film certainly is.
Some twenty-three years after the end of the Second World War, Submarine X-1 is still ludicrously and woodenly propagandist.
*****  The Japanese December 1941 invasion of the Philippines, culminating in the surrender by General Wainwright of all forces under his command in early 1942, is still America's greatest military catastrophe.
In any event the astronaut strikes up a deal with the survivalist for the space capsule's food supply and the female astronaut still on board, leading to their capture by the renegades and a series of bizarre scenes of social chaos that seem to have been inspired by Spaghetti Westerns.
Turns out a sadistic, well-connected college student has somehow managed to takeover this local chapter of post-Armageddon society, so alas, even in the event of nuclear war, it appears we're still destined to be ruled by idiot frat brats.
Simple acting, yet still quite inspired by silent movies technique.
It was all recorded directly when the film was shot on a sound stage most of the time and the microphones were still very primitive.
And the lighting was still far from particularly brilliant.
Strangely lacking in some of the more distinctive camera techniques one would expect from Hitchcock, Jamaica Inn overall is still an enjoyable watch Â just slow.
30 years later I can watch it on tape on TV and still get the same overwhelming emotional bliss knowing what it is doing to me.
While still in his soaking clothes, Trehearne pulls a dry folded piece of paper from his pocket.
It has been years since I saw it, but it is one of half a dozen films I'm still hassling the DVD shop if it will be available on one.
No, "The Third Man" was ours and I still think it as light-years away from the others I have mentioned in quality.
Carol Reed was at the height of his powers when he made "The Third Man", but he still had something almost as great to give before his slow decline.
Shortly after this, Martins discovers that Lime is actually still alive and meets with him at a local amusement park.
"The Third Man" is a flawless film of intrigue and suspense, a summit of perfection within the genreÂ It is one of the most literate thrillers ever madeÂ It is superb1y acted by an ensemble working in an understated, effortless styleÂ Its cinematography includes some of the best black-and-white work ever doneÂ Its score of haunting zither music is still remembered, instantly familiar to anyone who ever saw the film, and now thorough1y identified with most people's impressions of ViennaÂ Finally, the direction by Carol Reed is exemplaryÂ Rarely has a motion picture represented the collaboration of so many exceptional talents... "The Third Man" may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War IIÂ   The night city terrain of "The Third Man" is unique: occupied postwar Vienna, baroque, bombed-out, decadent, patrolled by Jeeps containing representatives of the four occupying powers, an American, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a RussianÂ  Corrupt, world-weary people hang about its fringes: the overly suave Rumanian, Popescu; the frayed violinist, Baron Kurtz; the atheistic collector of Catholic antiquities, Dr. Winkel; Crabbit, the tired head of the Anglo Cultural Center; and Anna Schmidt, the Czechoslovakian girl friend of Harry Lime, an obscure actress with forged papersÂ   Moving among them are three extraordinary principals, Holly Martins, a typical Greene creation; a hack American writer; a used- up second-rater; Colonel Calloway, a Scotland Yard type, chief of British Military Police; and Harry Lime (WeIles), the corrupt two-bit racketeer, a fully immoral, totally unreachable villainÂ   These characters wander through rain-slick night streets, in and out of shabby cafÃ©s, over the rubble of bombed-out buildings, even into a terrain vague dominated by a huge Ferris wheelÂ  The Vienna of "The Third Man" is a vast city that seems emptyÂ Its streets are always damp, and water rushes through a system of sweet-smelling sewers underneathÂ It is a world of slinking cats and biting parrots, of people taking advantage of each other without pityÂ   "The Third Man" meets the test of complexityÂ The characters interact, their stories conflict: A man who is supposed to be dead turns up alive, there is a question of whether two men or a "third man" carried off Lime's "body," there are conspiracies, deceits, and double crossesÂ   Reed owes debts to Fritz Long for some of his ideas: the geometrical shots, the montage of evidence, Welles' whistling, etc., but Reed has his own original visual style, particularly his use of a slightly tilted camera to produce so-called "Chinese angles," employed to project danger, foreboding, a twisted universeÂ He is also capable of providing suspense in the tradition of HitchcockÂ   "The Third Man" is unique in the genre for its realismÂ Despite the complexities of plot, the characters are understandable, dimensional, emotionally genuineÂa tribute to the fine ensemble playing and special, low-keyed acting style that is the cinematic equivalent of Graham Greene's writingÂ  Carol Reed was knighted for his excellence as a British filmmaker, and for a body of work that is notable for its good tasteÂ It is this taste, of course, that works so well in "The Third Man," but which has destroyed some of his other films, such as "Our Man in Havana," which require a certain amount of excess to make them workÂ
The music by Anton Karas is still haunting, with the exception of a few times at the beginning of a couple of scenes, when it startles the viewer and actually doesn't add anything to what we are about to see.
This doco looks at a band that is still actively recording, and by no means at the end of their career.
The weakest song on the album is probably Through The Never but its still a great song.
It still works, and you won't be wasting your money if you rent it.
This movie was quite tense - not so much as say "Seven", but it was still an enjoyable watching experience.
I actually saw this before I saw Dial M for Murder, but although this was a good story I still found the original better.
It still has a good plot.
Having said that  the film still works quite well, thanks to Michael Douglas.
Having said that the film  is still worth seeing, but if you need to watch this story, I  recommend the original.  
A Perfect Murder is an update of the Hitchcock classic 'Dial M For Murder', and while the film doesn't touch Hitchcock's in terms of how thrilling it is, this update has been well handled and despite losing things such as the claustrophobia and the tight plot, A Perfect Murder still does what you'd expect it to do.
The plot has become more expansive for this update, but the filmmakers have still managed to keep it tight so that the plot is focused mainly on the characters as opposed to the actual crime.
Still, A Perfect Murder never becomes boring and even during it's down time; the film still manages to be thrilling.
I am still wondering how stars like Vincent Perez and Michel Serrault could make such a poor movie.
The film cleverly and clearly explains many aspects of why the world is in trouble while allowing that we do still have time to stop the worst happening IF WE CHANGE NOW.
The Planet is an interesting summary of today's environmental problem, covering such topics as global warming, but also less well known topics (albeit still very important) such as resource exploitation and waste management.
This meant the dramas (psychological/psychical) while there (and this is a fairly laborious and talkative film confronting the issues of war and politics), were never overdone or overly milked, but still having enough kick to leave an impression.
The literary is heavy, but the roughly rampaging action (intense firefights) might only be minor, still it's staged with excellent ferocity and alertness that it becomes like a disorienting blur (definitely the night sequences) amongst the harshly authentic surrounding terrain.
A gritty Wendell Mayes script, fine acting by a largely unknown cast and tight direction, set Lancaster's superb work in an ironic context well-suited to a time in which America still believed its Vietnam military presence was "making the world safe for democracy."
The scene in which Lancaster explains to Singer why, after three wars and a bucket full of medals, he (Lancaster) is still only a major, is priceless.
Even if you know nothing about the world of film, the movie still entertains.
The fact that all we have left are these still photographs doesn't quench our thirst in the least bit, it makes us even thirstier.
Remaining still existing pictures of Lon Chaney in full make-up effect added to the hype of this movie and also the fact that this Tod Browning movie features vampires, 4 years before he made the horror-classic "Dracula", starring Bela Lugosi.
In 2002 a reconstruction, made from still photographs of the 1927 was made and aired on TCM.
At the rime of its release the movie already got mixed reactions from the critics, though the movie still was the highest grossing Tod Browning/Lon Chaney movie.
It's the reason why this movie is still probably better than the average one from the same genre, especially for 1927 standards.
This movie forms a good enough alternative to still be able to watch this lost 1927 movie from legendary director Tod Browning and actor Lon Chaney, until the real movie shows up again somewhere, though this isn't very likely to ever happen.
It is much more simple and clear to have it be a gun shot and they still had all of the great Gothic vampire atmosphere.
As a Spanish colony until the late 1800s, the country's Hispanic legacy is still strong, leaving behind a feudal nobility who owed its allegiances more to Madrid than Manila.
Accept that, and the film is still entertaining.
It will still be amazingly cool.
I still have no idea how John Woo is still making movies, but one things for sure, he shouldn't be.
Overall, it still my favorite one from the movie's two main stars!!
Director Woo knows how to turn in a decent action flick & he doesn't disappoint here, while the unmistakable style of his earlier Hong Kong films may have been slightly sterilised by Hollywood the set-pieces in his films still remain very impressive.
Turns out, the true reason is Maj. Deakins (Travolta), who is still in a grudge after being passed from promotion for a long time, is out to steal the two bombs and hold the for ransom.
I hate to say this but I could watch this a second time and still not get bored with it.
In Japan itself, they find two different worlds, the fast-paced metropolis of Tokyo, and the buddhist Temple, where time seems to stand still.
I really enjoyed these last two hours- but I was the perfect audience, so to say: As a German with huge interest in Japanese culture, a basic knowledge both of Japanese language and traditions(though in both I still have lots to learn) - I can understand many jokes which are often unnoticed.
Doris Dorrie has got the uncanny knack of rendering us speechless with her serious comic sagas which depict mundane human foibles.Erleuchtung Garantiert recounts a few mirthful episodes in the lives of its "crazy about spirituality" protagonists Uwe and Gustav.Uwe has never meditated in his life but still believes that it would help him in lessening his conjugal distress.The problems arise for them as they foolishly spend all their money in Tokyo.Things come to such a pass that they are forced to spend a few restless nights on the streets.Uwe and Gustav seem to have lost themselves completely in a metropolis like Tokyo where everyone is busy chatting on their mobile phones.The path to enlightenment is tricky for them but they happily tolerate all inconveniences in order to find spiritual bliss.They finally reach the Monzen monastery where they comprehend their innate strengths and weaknesses.Uwe overcomes the agony arising out of his failed marriage.Gustav realizes that he was never happy leading the life as a heterosexual male.He grasps that he has always been a homosexual person.Even though Erleuchtung Garantiert has been shot on Digital Video,it still manages to retain its ineffable charm.
But still I had some small glamors of hope that it could prove better than it looks.
A mania which is still vivacious today in FrÃ©dÃ©ric's mind and in his relentless training to be on this vital TV show about double celebrities.
He is depicted in the book as impulsive, selfish, stingy but still very likeable.
I hope she still thinks of me.
She then gets to run around in a shirt that's been slit up the sides so that you still frequently catch views of her crotch and buttocks.
Yes, it's one of those "little guy vs. big business tyrant" films, but it's also very different, because in this case, it's about a special-effects/animation geek, a character which, if it has ever been portrayed in film, would still be nothing close to this because the man playing the part is a real special-effects designer, animator and editor.
It's based on and around actual shorts he made, called "demo reels" that a special-effects designer/animator/editor/writer such as he would take to various film studios to showcase his talents, including the classic "The Wizard of Speed and Time," how difficult it is to make them, and how much harder still it is to get someone to see it.
If you can make it through the opening act, which sets up the characters involved in the movie, it'll be worth the wait...I felt that the movie could've been trimmed a bit and still would've been effective.
Intriguing, better-than-average old house thriller where a cantankerous old millionaire decides to give his money to his heirs whilst still alive - providing of course his lost granddaughter from a runaway daughter continues NOT to be found.
This is one of the less known murder-mysteries of the 30's, but it is still very good.
and still maintained the grit of the original.
Hildy is off to marry Bruce, played by Bellamy, but her ex, Walter, still needs her to be his star reporter and cover the execution of a convicted killer.
I remember watching this about 35 years ago and it still stands up - from start to finish.
Returning phone calls (I believe he's still in the L.A. phone book.)
Rather than simply admitting his continuing love for Hildy, Walter uses the great lengths to which he will go to stop her leaving to tell her how he still feels about her.
In addition to the entertaining and often-heated banter between Walter and Hildy, other excellent characters include Bruce Baldwin (the unfortunate would-be future husband whose is arrested on no less than three occasions, and whose mother is kidnapped), the bumbling Sheriff Peter B. Hartwell (Gene Lockhart), Walter's sneaky henchman, Diamond Louie (Abner Biberman), the governor's clueless delivery-man, Joe Pettibone (Billy Gilbert) and a long line of newspaper reporters, each of whom witnesses the same event and yet still reports it in a completely different and entirely inaccurate manner.
Strangely, without computers and cell phones, the story of journalists working on a story holds up because the emotions and activities are realistic and still go on.
For a play from 1931 this one still has relevance.
This Walter Burns still wants to get his scoops, but there are moments of fragility when he realizes he may forever lose Hildy to her fiancÃ© Bruce (the ever helpless Ralph Bellamy).
And that's just for starters: The timing of the thing is still awe- inspiring after sixty-odd years; the supporting actors, down to the bit-players, are all memorable, convincing and hilarious; the camera work (this IS the forties, though) is inventive and the editing superb.
The background strains of music as Orson Welles first recognizes Claudette Colbert haunts me still.
As I am a huge fan of the original I couldn't help but judge this sequel on it and so I probably don't see it as 'fresh' as other views but even so I still found it weak viewing.
If you still insist on watching the film and are a fan of the original, expect to be disappointed.
Beltrami takes a slightly different tone as far as the music, but still stays true to Revelle's Gothic roots.
It's still enjoyable, however, the mystery subplot did seem to take away from the love story a bit.
The 2nd one stunk, but its still got a few points for cinematography.
10 years old and still a good movie  Rating: 9/10
Parts of the film did lack in places but was still exceptional viewing nevertheless.
From about 10 seconds in, I remembered this movie competely, and was filled with merriment in the way people get when you see something again that you loved as a kid, and is still as good.
T-Bird, Tin-Tin, Skank, and Funboy are still vivid in my memory.
Don't get me wrong, I still like The Crow as a film and Brandon as an actor.
But, I do feel the heart of the story is still here and the element of man's link with the crow is quite present here.
In childhood every detail is full of meaning, full of amusement, the near future holds grand plans and dreams, in childhood myths can have very real appearances, and there are many many summer minutes to spend with your friends, on the dried meadows of the village or maybe on the imaginary sands of the coast...  A childhood in the East: where townsmen are too poor but have their pride, where they still pay a lot of attention and appreciate the small details, where life repeats its slow rhythms and the future is blissfully far away.
In the East myths still can have very real appearances, and there are many many daily moments to spend enjoying the simple blessings of God while waving off the flies in the hot air, chatting with your watermelon customers, or taking a nap!
One day we realise it has been gone for some time already, while we had still so much more plans and business to do with it...!
The excitement of watching and listening to those legends is still with me and I especially remember the amazement that registered on Chubby Checker's face when he saw the enthusiastic response he was getting from the crowd so many years after his hit version of Hank Ballard's Twist.
And even though there are some CGIs used for some of the scenes where the two main characters meet, I still think this is a sick tale to put on screen.
It is the end of the summer and they are still singing the theme song.
Elfen Lied has nothing to fear now, it still probably can top this.
The story is told in a realistic way and all of the actors are also realistic in their roles but still the story comes across as unbelievable and not credible.
Not every character might serve exactly a clear purpose for the story, they still prevent "Birth" from being an one sided flat movie with slow moments in it.
Even if you don't like violence I believe most people would still appreciate this anime.
It has better character settings in term of 'realism' (People are a lot more believable), more serious (less jokes that was less appearing to 'serious story' seekers, and still contains a lot of gore.
Despite certain drawbacks such as a clichÃ©d story line, amateur acting, and some questionable scenes this movie still shines.
Instead, he makes a different choice but ruins it still with an uncalled for action (disgusting action rather) that was drop dead uproarious to me.
I don't care if a film is low budget, it could still look good with substance in story, character, acting, etc.
So, with the proper knowledge of making movies, with zero dollars, it can still look good.
Ordinary Cambodians are still grieving rather than blaming.
Avoiding hunger, or the thousands of landmines that still litter their country.
This place formerly known as Security Prison 21, or 'S.21' for short, still has living ghosts.
I still believe that he was sean though....the letters he read couldn't have told him where her husband died.
Most of them will still be together, bu they have to say goodbye to a good friend who is going off to a distant college.
It's still a landmark film.
It is still one of my dad's favorite movies and he's always had a copy (be it on VHS or on laser-disc, yeah he's had it that long).
The plot is extremely simple (but I still hope that I can do it justice).
Granted, Lucas grew up during this period and was into cruising, but the setting is still essential to the theme of the movie.
Other reviewers have already made mention of the fact that the outstanding success of this landmark film was almost single handedly responsible for igniting the "retro" craze that quickly grew into a major international subculture and is still going strong today.
The US was still in Vietnam.
These kids were still dealing with the all important activities of cruising, muscle cars, going steady, street racing, the choice between beach music and rock & roll, and whether or not they should wait a year before going off to college.
Thirty years from now, people will still be looking back on this and remembering how much of a superb film it was, and how many fine films it inspired!!!
Nicole Kidman, as a woman still in love with her dead husband, is torn between settling down with a man (her fiancÃ©e) who is 'able' to satisfy 'her needs' and her longing for a love which could fill her up to the brim with ecstasy and rapture.
Despite the fact that it wasn't a feature film, I still rank it over the majority of films of recent years as well.
Yet, they still try to maintain some sense of their former selves.
It is still one of the most incredible things that I have seen on television.
Good to know I can still hate you.
i've since taped this movie off of cable and i still cry every time i see it.
Years before Jack Higgins would turn the concept into his bestseller (and later still a fine film) called The Eagle Has Landed writers John Dighton, Angus MacPhail and Diana Morgan would take a short story by famed writer Graham Greene (The Third Man, Our Man In Hanvana etc.)
Although clearly made on a low budget (there was a war on, you know), this movie still has the power to shock, albeit mildly.
At the time of its release in 1942, Britain still stood alone.
The relationships and acting are sometimes just a little stagy at times, but still mostly quite believable.
Yet this is a movie that can still entertain well.
There are supporting characters who join in the fray, but ultimately, it's still focused on one of the first two couples who have their opportunity to make or break with our killers on the loose.
(I know it's cheesy but it still made me jump.)
I still like the first three chainsaws better but this was a step up to the old days.
Oh - and nicole kidman reminded me of a loveless and neurotic icy-frigid Aunt - not a hint of a deeply emotional soul who still pines for her long-dead hubby.
the odd character didn't seem to have much of a purpose other than to die horribly and scared teenage girls still have that tendency to walk towards the screams of pain rather than leg it, but the grimness and violence of it all was pretty much relentless.
And guess what, I have a stack of 45s and I'm still waiting for them to become valuable.
Looking back now, in 2005, it still holds up as entertainment, and sleazy entertainment at that, but the ending is too routine, insulting and oh-so-typical of the genre; it's the "trick 'em at the end" leg-puller where the murderer is revealed to be the most stupid of characters and you can't believe the film's ended on such a low note.
One of these actors of the old generation who were, and some of them still are and have taught the trade to a few younger ones, able to impersonate any part, any role, any situation as if they were chameleons.
Keller is contacted by a Det.Sherman, John Goodman, From the 112th police precinct in Richmond Hills Queens of a murder in that area that is very similar to the one he's investigating; A man shot dead with a bullet in the back of his head as he lay naked in bed, even the same song "Sea of Love" was still playing on his record player.
The fact that this film can go on for almost two hours with very little action and still keep you riveted to your seat speaks highly of its entertainment value.
Since then I have caught Sea of Love about a dozen times on cable and still to this day enjoy the thrilling drama.
Sea of Love doesn't get the respect it deserves still it airs on cable but watch this on a dark and rainy night alone or day for that matter and feel the thrills and suspense of this steaming thriller you would see it's one of the best films around I don't see who would or could dislike this so take a swim in the sea of love!
Actor John Ford Noonan who played a sort of "God" mouthpiece,should of been singled out by Indie crowd as one of the best performances in years,but to my surprise,many people still have not heard of this film,and when I called the IFC channel to complain (I read one of the viewer's rants on the IFC's refusel to play it) They gave me no reasonable excuse,just a simple "We passed on that title".
First caught this back in 2003, own the DVD now and still impressed by this indie flick.
This Mr. Reincarnation was accurate down to the smallest details of how his actions should be as an adult while also displaying how his vehicle was still that of a child's.
I went to Calcutta in 1999 and people still ride on human rickshaws (a person runs barefoot on streets while pulling the rickshaws for few cents).
The story may well have been copied but the film is no doubt still great.
Like other movies by him, art and commercial form of cinema are merged to produce a movie that is still looked upon as a benchmark.
This is not really how it feels like to be run over, but still.
I liked this one, but I still miss the artisticness that some of the French or Japanese movies have.
Later on Michi and two other co-workers notice that within Taguchi's files there is a strange picture of his own room and what seems to be Taguchi standing still to the side of his computer, which is also showing the same image.
You'll be watching a girl finding a corpse still hanging from the knot in one scene and then literally 10 seconds later seeing her again at some place apparently unaffected, smiling and going about.
And the night after you saw the movie, you're still in it.
Plus, there is still somethings that I don't understand, but loved anyway.
and i still loved it!!
And even if you disliked it: it still beats watching a Stephen King or Wes Craven film, doesn't it?
It's disturbing and eerie, and frankly I wouldn't watch it alone in the dark, but I'll admit that I'm a bit of a coward (The Grudge still terrifies me, so make of that what you will).
Even though this film is considered an older J-horror film, it's still fresh in my book.
For a bit of nostalgia or else those still desperate for a fix of anything ninja related the series is probably worth a look as long as you don't set your expectations too high.
the story is simple and violence OTT (which is a sign of MIIKE ) there doesn't seem to be as much style put into this film as Miike was only the assistant director but there are still signs of him in it.
I watched it horrible 60 minutes long, still waiting for something positive.
Compare this Audie film with the last film of Clint Eastwood or even Soldier Ryan (which has still a lot of unbearable patriotism).
However, the story is still good.
It is of course "sanitized" as far as language and violence are concerned since the Hayes office was still around.
Even though I was disappointed, I still recommend watching this film because of my admiration for Audie Murphy, and to observe a particular attitude about war that was common in 1950s America.
Working two jobs at this age, he still wrote cursively w/ excellent spelling and diction when he had to quit his education.
While it's amazing that the baby faced Murphy still looks young enough in 1955 for the story to work 15 years after the fact, the truly amazing thing is that from most accounts, Murphy understates his own role in many of the events described in the movie.
I still hope that "8 1/2" is going to change my mind about Fellini's work.
The former one is rather decent, still "normal" and "appropriate" male who searches the ideal woman.
After all, it is still Fellini in CITY OF WOMEN.
Of course, Fellini is a master, and "La cittÃ¡ Dell Donne" is still the work of a master, who revisits one of his obsessions: women and sex and eroticism.
If one really finds nothing to like in La cittÃ  delle donne, it's ultimately still an important document on the gender battles that recent humanity has crossed.
I got Rainbow Six a couple of years ago for a cheap price.I didn't really like this game.Rainbow Six is a fairly overrated game in my opinion.Its hard.I had this game for years and I am still stuck on the second level.The first level was pretty fun and had a fair amount of action.The graphics were great for 1998.However this game I thought was pretty hard and overrated.If you see Rainbow Six for a very cheap price buy it but by cheap I mean under $9.99.I have not played the other Tom Clancy games.
Both early and final release versions still have no opening credits so the audience has no idea whom/what to expect--making it such a triumph when we recognize the never (EVER) credited Matt Damon as a young priest shot mid-distance; and Soderbergh's nom-de-plume photographer credit of "Peter Andrews".
Che Guevara was lionised by the liberal left from Sartre to Nelson Mandela, and is still a hero to many of the world's youth.
Even if at times things do get a little slow, it's still a rewarding and informative experience.
Use of a new 9-pound 35 mm-quality RED "digital high performance cine camera" that just became available in time for filming enabled DP Peter Andrews and his crew to produce images that are a bit cold, but at times still sing, and are always sharp and smooth.
When you get down to it though, Corbucci is still really just a simplistic action director who likes explosions, last-minute escapes and indestructible heroes.
Now, I've said it once and this matter still troubles me...why wasn't the movie as good?
Oh well...I still have the proud memory of this great game!
One of those many titles this movie has makes it hard to identify it in my TV magazine but still...  Why was I so curious about this movie?
My DVD copy is a cheap one and seems badly edited but the fun and vibrancy of the film still comes through.
My favorite film by Corbucci is still the incomparably brilliant "Il Grande Silenzio" ("aka.
While FF8 does have its drawbacks, it's still a better game than FF7 in a lot of ways.
Thats okay, it still tells you about one of the greatest players ever in college football.
I downloaded the end because I still havent got there yet im at the first battle for the 4th disc.
Laguna and Raine have a very short but sweet relationship and you feel sorry for him in the end sequence because he still misses her a lot and they were married and are the parents of Squall.

Despite an 18 minute footage cut from the original, still its a great direction from Mabel Cheung.
I still cringe at the thought of "Youngblood".
I still do.
But it's still fun to watch.
I still fall apart every time I hear that line.
Then there's the balance between winning and playing the game, something many parents and coaches still lose sight of even today.
Though his open defiance and teen-cool stance masquerades a need to be liked and wanted, he still provides a mean spark before coming into his own.
I just watched this film for the first time in many years (thanks TCM), and it's still very funny.
Having been unathletic as a child, I still get damp around the eyes every time Timmy Lupus catches that fly ball.
together, they do not make a good team, but after Buttermaker's ex- girlfriend's daughter, Amanda joins the team to prove to Buttermaker she can still pitch and the local bully "lone shark" (as Ahmad said), Kelly Leak joins the team to tick off the A$$hat Yankee's coach, Roy Turner, the Bear's eventually get their act together and become a great team, going to the championship (and losing), still think it's sounds boring?
You may go in thinking you are going to see a nostalgic, foul-mouthed spectacle of spunk and charm, and you are, but you may well leave like I did wondering if there's a little of you still lying on that baseball field, too.
I was 9 went it was released and I still have more emotional attachment to it than any other movie of childhood, even over Rocky or Star Wars.
Now watching it again after twenty-some years I see my tastes in movies has changed but it was still surprisingly good.
The acting lukewarm - the dialog - forced, but it is still worth it to demonstrate what jerks we can all be trying to be supportive.
I enjoyed watching The Bad News Bears.At first though I didn't want anything to do with it.Seeing as how I'm not really into sports movies, I didn't feel like watching this at all, but I was forced by my friend, who has good taste, and he loved it, so I decided to give it at least 1 viewing.Well, I have to say when the movie started up, I was already dreading it.It just seemed to me to be very boring and plain, and I just kept getting more and more aggravated as the movie continued on.Suddenly, it's like the whole thing changed around.I started getting a bit more entertained, and it sort of changed up from how other sports movies are.I still didn't get what I wanted from The Bad News Bears, but in all fairness this was a really good and original movie, that wasn't as bad as I was thinking it to be.I especially liked the outcome of this movie, for it was very cool, and if you give it a chance like I did, I'm sure you will too.
I had first played this game in the year 2000 and i thought then, what a great game, now, almost 7 years on i still think it is one of the best RPG games.
It's worth watching this film again just to remind ourselves that only 30 years ago children still enjoyed some autonomous space in which to grow, and the iron doors of the Nanny State had not yet completely swung closed upon them.
The production values were a bit higher, but it still was a very bad film--just not bad enough to be funny or memorable.
Not to mention epic beauty and dialogue that still fascinates me today.
This is still the greatest game I have ever played.
However, there are still so many flawed aspects.
I spent hours at the Massachusetts statehouse over the years this battle has been going on, and watching the film brings me right back there--the songs, the instant friends that were made, the love of the supporters---it's still raw and they capture it on film.
Our people around the world are entering a new age of equality but there is still a struggle in securing more equality and retaining the gains that we have already made.
From high points when we see both lovely long-term and youthful couples exchanging vows and the election of a gay man to the Massachusetts Parliament, to low points where an elected official of that same government forthrightly denies historical injustices against LGBT people and contemporary realities of abuse, harassment, discrimination and worse, and finishing on the sad reality that bigotry still prevails in much of the American public, a bigotry which could strip same-sex couples of this right, I recommend that everyone with an opinion on same-sex marriage view this.
The always reliable Stockard Channing is also featured as her snobbish sister and Sam Waterston is charming as a man Alley gets involved with but this is Alley's movie and she forsakes any pretense of glamor to realistically portray an unsympathetic character in a difficult situation who somehow still manages to make us feel for her even though we know that a lot of what this woman does and feels is just wrong.
It made me a little bit sad because Alien Resurrection is my favorite of them all but Alien Evolution was so well done and what the people had to say was so interesting that I still give it a perfect 10 on 10 because it was excellent!
With KCC, these seem _pastiched or quite borrowed (yet they are still functional and did not get the _movieish character of later pastiches that are merely laboratory abstract products)Âbut then again, such the things were the good of a whole era in cinema Â.
One scene in particular lets us see some guys getting onto a boat while we could still watch a nice old Mercury woody wagon and its occupant in the background.
Bitter ex-cop Tim Foster (expertly played with consummate steely resolve by Preston Foster) is still fuming about his forced early retirement, so he decides to get his revenge by devising a fiendishly clever perfect caper.
Slightly marred by a rather sappy conclusion, "Kansas City Confidential" overall still rates highly as the authentic gnarly noir article.
It still wound up good overall, but it never lived up to that great beginning.
It has as a full lulls here and there but still does enough things right to keep your interest.
But the cutscenes are still absolutely gorgeous, and for the time, this was top-of-the-line.
And even looking back, the worlds are still beautiful and the creatures you fight are still realistic-looking (well, as realistic as a giant plant with great big tentacles can be).
The somewhat dated graphics of the actual gameplay don't really detract from the rest of the story, though, so I'll still give them a 9/10.
I hate to admit it, but even if you mastered everything about the Materia system of VII, you might still get a headache learning the Junction system.
But still, 8/10.
It's one you can watch over and over again and still be entertained.
Payne is freed, but the Kansas City cops are still suspicious.
He's tough, all right, but still shows the flop-sweat of fear; and he's smart, too, but because he's forced to be Â what he's trying to hang onto is all he's got.
This movie is great for every metal fan, and if you don't even like the music its still entertaining and builds up you understanding about Metal, Headbanging, and why Norwegian Blac metal stinks.
This was not a corny VH1 type of special but rather a heartfelt tip of the hat to a culture that is still going on with teenagers and with us slightly older folks.
For those of us who are into it, we might not learn too much new during the movie, but we can still sit back and let ourselves be entertained.
Not only does it take place in a world we can believe and understand (a somewhat futuristic world that is fairly peaceful but still militarized), but it features characters we can feel akin to, for the first real time in the FF Series.
However, to be honest with you, most of this doc is so informative, and fun to watch that I still consider it to be one of the best documentaries ever made.
Unlike 1988' The Decline II: "The Metal Years" disaster while a big deal at the time, it still remains a brutal "cringe-fest" from start to finish and focused on predominately one style (Glam)one era (The 80s) one location(Sunset Strip) and barely covers the period of Heavy Metal that is STILL alive and well: thrash, black, speed,etc   I would have never guessed that a film about Heavy Metal would take serious the attitudes, styles, individuals,genres and provide a clear history time-line unlike Decline and any others of that ilk.
Now that I'm older, it's still interesting to indulge my morbid curiosity but I can say that there is some stuff in this type of film that will leave an impact.
NOTE: My version had Chinese language only but the narration is still just as retarded.
Thank You Jackie Collins for giving us a chance to see more projects and actors otherwise not considered for romantic roles..JACK Scalia will still be sexy in his 80s..  Again, this movie was a wonderful escape and ended way to soon!
movie is?, the only thing I liked about it was Farrah Fawcett, she was really good in it, she looked different, but I still loved her in this movie, I gave it a 7 because I thought 8-10 was too much, if this was a motion picture it probably would be a 2 star movie, but anyway I liked it, I even taped the movie for myself.
It still gets a place on the mantel.
It's still as good as ever.
The story is way out there, the technical equipment is interesting and lots of it probably still holds up 16 years later, and the cast is great.
The pacing is great, the movie neither stands still nor rushes through.
The item in question actually deals with encryption algorithms that are still in use today.
Bishop has a dark past, but he's likable enough that we still root for him.
This film is superb and extremely forward-thinking... today, eight years later, all of the technology, themes, and allusions still make sense.
But neither of those Cold War films are relevant today, while SNEAKERS still is.
I watched this twice, the latest in 1999, and still am amazed at some of the things they can do with computers.
Of course, some hacking techniques are commonplace and outdated now, but it is still engrossing to see these acts in action.
Seven years have passed since this movie came out, which is a long time in the gadget world in which this film is based, but none of their equipment or techniques (except a brief glimpse of a now outdated version of Windows but that's REALLY nitpicking) seem out of date; it could still be today.
I still remember being all psyched up for the first episode of the second season.
I'm convinced that had the original theme been pursued the second season would have been more exciting while still maintaining its scientifically realistic roots Â truly a loss for a truly brilliant show.
A rare jewel among shows of the science-fiction genre, which still had the courage to try even when it fell short of the viewers' expectations...
And I still do, as I observed when I saw it again more than 20 years later.
This was considered pretty shocking in its day--today it's fairly tame (although it would still get an R rating) with gratitous blood, gore and female nudity.
As bad as this silliness was it still outshone The Beatles "Help" by a wide margin.
Regardless it's still a fun popcorn movie.
This entry, filmed as CANNIBAL WORLD, shows that he still has that special touch to make xerox cinema as this is almost a scene by scene remake of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST.
Plus, Mattei shows he still has a knack for making the funniest dubbed dialogue.
If you look away from the small plot holes and stuff like that, this movie isn't as bad as the Fast and Furious movies, but it is still not good.
Dennis Hopper proves he still has it.
There was a nice development of the characters while still maintaining the action that I was looking for.
Not as funny as the original, but still has plenty of laughs and action as the team solves the Alphabet Crimes.
While it was obviously still produced with men in mind (plenty of the actress in her red underware), it still kept to a pretty emotional story about a disfunctional family trying to find each other.
I first saw this movie at age 8 and still love it and keep it in my personal video collection.
This movie could have generated a simple laugh by having Axl still driving around in his old blue Chevy Nova.
Of course the truth is he is still too young (in 1547 he is only 11) and he really can only rule in his own right when he reaches adult age (presumably 21).
Now, after his downfall, he works as a security guard in a garage, and is still a junkie.
My addiction is only to cigarettes, Thank God, but I still understand Jack's addiction.
Suddenly, the junkie starts to hallucinate, and see his dead friend (who is still half-naked, even as a mirage) who tells him to kill people.
Despite the jackhammer being attached to an extension cord, the junkie is still able to chase people and kill them, easily.
It is still also one of the best.
Of course, being made so many years ago, much of it seems dated (especially the very early CGI helicopters) but for me, it's a minor complaintÂthe movie still rocks hard.
It looks a shade dated now (20 years on), but still packs quite a punch.
But still a very good thriller until the decision of the writers to put in another plot twist at the end that completely spoiled the movie for me.
swineherders), this particular case still elicits misunderstanding, even WITH the kindergarten paint-by-numbers explanation in the final minutes.
Okay, so this was not as explosive as the first "Beverly Hills Cop" movie, but it still had enough energy to succeed.
But still a very surprising movie.
But really that kid is still alive, and he kills Amanda Peet.
I didn't like it quite as much this time, although it still earned a "B".
The Twilight Zone aspect makes itself most obvious beginning with the scene where the convict, Robert Maine (Jake Busey), tries to flee, but discovers that he's still at the motel, after all.
Even though I wasn't as enraptured in suspense this time, one is still drawn into the film by the gradual quickening and spiraling of loss of control experienced by the characters.
When I watched the film upon its theatrical release, I overheard more than one fellow theater-goer still trying to figure out the gist as the lights came up.
I've seen The Emperor's Candlesticks twice now and I'm still trying to figure it out.
The stars all lived for a very long time, and in fact, Rainer at this writing is still alive at the age of 96.
The reason I mentioned "Beverly Hills Cop II" in my review was that, for me, it's one of those films that you know inside out and still enjoy watching it despite the fact that it isn't the best example of the genre.
But for all it's faults, I still enjoy watching this film.
But if you're still trying to blank the memory of Thatcher, Reagan and (more horrifically) The Human League, steer well clear.
I still can't say John Ashton and Judge Reinhold match up to Laurel and Hardy, like Martin Brest (director of the original) said, but they do make a great team.
I still stand by my word in saying this is the best in the "Cop" series!
I'm not sure, but the War must have affected them so completely that they still go on about so much, especially in Brother 2.
Because I love this film so much I am giving it a perfect score, but disregarding my connection to former USSR I still recommend it highly.
Also keep in mind it was time just after aggression of US against Yugoslavia and time of victories of federal forces in the second Chechen war - everyone still remembered the humiliation of the first war as well as all previous decade .
I've seen this movie may be 50 times and everytime I turn it On I still wanna see it again.
One really hopes that some traditional Russian moral values still stand.
While many of my Russian friends consider this movie to be extremely low-brow, I still can't put my finger on what I like about it so much.
If none of the above, save your time and watch a Petticoat Junction rerun; you'll find it infinitely more professional and still worth a chuckle.
I'm still trying to find out what color my parachute is!
Francis Lederer was a man totally devoted to his craft, still teaching Acting until the end of his very long life, and I was amused by the fact that Dantine was himself a former concentration camp inmate!
Which once again starred Kay Parker,in a smaller, less meatier role, although she still played the same character as in the first.
Although today the films of this industry are much more sophisticated , Taboo is still amazingly stimulating and not old fashioned at all .
Although I wouldn't want to be in his situation, of deciding on the fate of survivors in a lifeboat, still I felt his decisions were the best that could be done in such an extreme and dire situation.
I still get goose bumps as I think about Powers making the final decision on those that are considered "dead weight".
I saw it at the theater in the early 90's and it still seems fresh 13 years later.
Also, it is one of those rare movies that can be watched over and over and still surprisingly be interesting, enjoyable and brightly funny!
Constructed in a much flashier and faster-paced visual style than the first film, the song still remains the same as Foley tries to keep his job in Detroit while solving crimes for the Beverly Hills cops.
Murphy again makes the most of culture shock for comic effect, and the easy rapport between Murphy and Billy (Judge Reinhold), now a cheerfully over the top Rambo-esquire figure, is still the centerpiece of this series.
Great actors, a talented director and writer still can't save a bad script.
I saw this film when it first came out and I loved it then and still do so I'm pleased to have finally bought it on DVD.
It would have been nice to see more of interactions between Mr Wilson and Dennis since that was always a great focal point of the cartoon series but this film is still a worthy successor.
This is a live-action version of the classic comic-strip that i still read to this day.
The formula is exactly the same (and man I really mean exactly), although it follows all of the usual rules of an action sequel, which state that it must have a much bigger budget (Axel still does his police work by his own rules, only this time he uses precinct money to drive around in a Ferrari), more deaths, faster and funnier jokes (it clearly shoots for this one, anywayÂ), and at least one more 6-foot platinum blonde.
The 2 main villains are very menacing, even though we hardly see Jurgen Prochnow, he was still very menacing when on screen.
It's somewhat of a rehash of the 1st, but that's okay Murphy is still funny as hell, and The finale is excellent.
Worse than American Ninjas 3 with its rubber knives & awful acting, worse than Sickle even (The Slaughterhouse Massacre with its stupid archetypal characters, wafer thin plot & shameful acting) - why, it's EVEN worse than The Thin Red Line (for which I still want compensation for the hours of wasted life & trauma.)
After 15 years I still feel I was unfairly robbed of 1.5 hours of my life.
At least there are a dozen or so Miss Withers novels by Stuart Palmer ( many still in print including THE PENGUIN POOL MURDER) for us to cast her again in our minds eye again in the role.
Even if the mystery becomes too familiar to be suspenseful upon repeated viewings, THE PENGUIN POOL MURDER can still be savored due to Oliver and Gleason's marvelous chemistry.
I loved Beverly Hills Cop 2, I hope I do find the third one, I know it doesn't have as good of a rating like the first or the second one, but still I love Eddie Murphy.
Hildegard is a schoolteacher, who takes her class (a remarkably mixed racial class for 1932) on a field trip to the New York Acquarium, then in lower Manhattan in what is still Castle Clinton National Monument (it was also, in the 1850s, Castle Gardens, where Jenny Lind sang to the public).
), while Philo Vance was still at his peak, Charlie Chan had just started his marathon run, and two years before Dashiel Hammett would backtrack to seemingly invent the "comedy mystery" in the first of the THIN MAN series, Stuart Palmer's "Hildegarde Withers" stories were pointing the way to that perfect bantering comedy.
At this point in his career, Heston was still experimenting, trying to find himself as actor by taking on such varied roles as a circus boss, President Andrew Jackson, a South American plantation owner, a soldier of fortune, or a surgeon.
When I watch this movie today, I still think it was a good idea.
the gram pa scared the #%$@ out of me and still does**shudder**.
Now she is four and still enjoys the Polies.
I mean Axel gets so involved in a case that he almost cost, Billy, Taggert and himself a job and he still succeeds.
Yet in spite of all my mental preparation...I still could believe how terrible this movie was!
It's still a pretty good movie.
But still the film has some faults to it.
But you can also enjoy this on tape, because VHS copies are still floating around at used video stores.
This quintessential eighties style is carried over to the sequel, made three years later, and although part two; like many sequels, never quite manages that same verve as the original film - it still offers a good time, and anyone that enjoyed the first instalment (and who didn't?)
While they were still over the top, they were at least sort of believable.
I was surprised by the violence (you see a large bunch of policeman shooting at the giant and Superman takes quite a beating from the robots) but it's still perfect for kids.
This production must have really looked cool to kids and adults 67 years ago because it still looks good today in 2008.
Of course, this sequel can't top the original, but it's still pretty good.
Some of the jokes I am still figuring out or hearing after seeing it multiple times (I bet she'll invite us in for some tea and strumpets (prostitutes).
No matter how many times I watch this movie, it is still funny.
I have probably seen it 30 times and still laugh.
Even halfway through the movie, they still do things even stupider than you could possibly expect.
I did notice that the film lacked the freshness of the first one but still it was fun to watch.
However, to this day, this movie is still one of the most beloved comedies in decades.
It still has a cult following.
Jeff Daniels does and equally good job as Harry who is less dumb then Lloyd but still gets into plenty of trouble.
The story overall is a road ride in the eyes of two likable idiots who are oblivious to everything and yet, they still manage to get out of trouble without even trying.
All I know is it's one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and to this day, I still watch it.
In the past I've given negative ratings to films of the same genre that are just meant to be brain-less, silly fare (such as "Me, Myself & Irene") - the difference here is that "Dumb and Dumber" manages to come across as both likable and entertaining, while still managing to feature characters we can actually, in some crazy way, find ourselves liking.
After all these years I still can't tell who's the brains of this pathetic operation: Harry or Lloyd.
Years later they teamed up with Carrey again to film "Me Myself and Irene," which was a great movie, but even though the movie was nastier, even though it contained a chicken up a filthy pig's ass, it still couldn't match the wonderful grossness Peter, Bobby, Jim & Jeff provided in one of the funniest films in cinema history.
Dumb & Dumber takes a good story, adds some tear-inducing comedy, some endlessly hilarious dialogue ("I guess they're right, old people, though slow and dangerous behind the wheel, can still serve a purpose.
I almost swallowed my tongue, spat out my drink twice almost peed myself and watched it so many times I know the script even now 10 years on I still laugh it my friends eternal Harry and Lloyd...
Only his grandfather knows that Vitus' talent is still there and Vitus is faking its lack.
still picture Jack and Skinny Chicken perfectly.
Yam is easily an underrated actor, whose talent is still yet to be recognised within the HK Films Award.
I have seen it so many times and it still touches my heart.
Don't get me wrong, she's still cute, but the man whom she gets...he's not what he seems.
"The Dunwich Horror" is much more disturbing, although it bears all characteristics of a seventies movie like the soundtrack and the clothing, but it still works.
But none the less (again) it's a good film for it's time and still decent enough to stand up to most of the crap that's coming out of the celluloid grinder.
Dunwich Horror is very similar in style to the Night Gallery tv series (which was rarely successful, but I still enjoy watching it if I get a chance).
It proves that he can pull off a lead role, and it is too bad that even after this movie's release fourteen years ago, he is still just moving through movies as part of a film's additional cast.
True, it had a bit much nudity for my taste, but still, it never took away from the movie.
I was still putting the pieces together hours after the movie had ended.
Giving this film some sense of relevance of course is its premise, as the film explores subjects still very much on people's minds.
I still think the premiere episode and some of the subsequent ones were some of the best work ever done in science fiction.
I still sometimes think in terms of "centons", and "microns", and praise the lords of Kobol.
Let me know when they are planning to air the rest of the show or if it is still in production.
My sister used to watch it just for Richard Hatch and still does!
That niggle aside, I still love watching both the series and the movie.
And today, I still love those two movies, but can understand the bad reputation the series gained.
Starbuck impersonates everything a boy wants to be (he's so damn cool), and I still go by the codename Starbuck today, though (or maybe because) I am totally different.
The special effects are still spectacular to this day, and while they could have cheapened the actual drama of the show, they didn't.
I still love seeing the Vipers launch out of their tubes(I'd like to see an X-Wiin have a dramatic entrance like that)A lot of work went into the show only to have ABC cancel it out of stupidity.
---> visiting cast members like:  -------> Lloyd Bridges as Commander Cain was truly memorable  -------> Patrick McNee as Count Iblis was also highly memorable  -------> Ray Milland and Fred Astaire were good guest stars too  * the costumes  ---> I liked the Colonial Warrior uniforms - they still have a style to them today.
* the music - I still like the theme song to Battlestar Galactica  * the behavior of the Ceylons was entertaining.
Today Battlestar Galactica is considered to be an example of how not to do sci-fi - despite the opening promise, with the unforgettable destruction of humanity's home and the following promise of hope still bringing tears to my eyes - the series quickly degenerated into children's television aimed at the youngest and dimmest of children everywhere.
I think it shows a reality that existed and still exists today.
The age difference shows in that she is still a child and wants to play rather than behave like an adult.
I'm still not very sure where the moral center of the movie was located, but I think that was Malle's point-- that it's a good idea to question and re-evaluate all taboo subjects to understand why they are taboo in the first place.
And at the finale is obvious how her innocence is still there when her mom comes back with a new dad for her and wants to take her to a better life, and she says to her husband/photographer "Can't we all go?"...
Today most of us would strongly disapprove of such lifestyles, and would rightly emphasize how far we have progressed by ensuring young people have the opportunity to choose their own lifetime partner; but we still need to be honest about the problems this new lifestyle has created today.
There are still actual whores who are 12 or younger.
And when Storyville was still running, the Red Light District would promote each slut it had.
Even Madame Nell knows to auction off a preteen's virginity is illegal, but it still happened.
Her parents obviously knew what was going to happen and still allowed her to participate.
Today, still.
Shields reaction is perfect, she is angered that he still thinks of her as a child, but cannot help but play with the doll in the very next scene.
For instance "The Brotherhood" is still on, as far as I know, and it really isn't any good at all.
They still wear their black outfits and wreak havoc on the unsuspecting population, though.
However, I still couldn't help but feel uncomfortable watching this, especially since Besse was about that age when she made the film and appears bare-breasted several times.
Again, my introduction to foreign films came from the Los Angeles Based "Z" Channel - even with the hundreds of premium channels out there in 2005, I still miss Z for I haven't seen in on American TV since!
A supposed war victim and gone for years after his marriage to her, Wells - despite now having a beard and aging a bit - would still be recognizable (at the least, audibly) to his former wife.
It was asking a bit much to believe she wouldn't realize it was him, but it's still good storytelling and a film that hits you deeply.
Most of the Â admittedly overlong - film focuses on RÃ©mi fighting, accepting and regretting his own feelings towards Marion, but still the film never really feels boring and there are plenty of neat details to keep you pleased.
It's still a space-flight combat game, but an excellent one at that.
30+ years later you still have to reference this show when discussing the Great American Sitcom.
I still don't like the first season too much.
OK OK--his wife had left him but still... After the first season though the series picked up speed and just got better and better.
Contrary to Married with children (which is also an extremely funny and smart show), it depicted the ethics that most of the families miss today - ethical parents, democrats, charity loving and enjoy the bonds they have and though they play it so safe during the whole show, they still got you laughing in a joyous way.
Flipping through TV Land at 3AM one night I watched both parts of this pivotal episode and was still astounded.
Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoyed it.
Even today, its themes are still relevant.
It's still funny and is a great show that kids and parents can watch together and not be embarrassed.
Pity Tina Yothers stopped acting as it is amazing what a quantity and quality of dialogue she delivered at a very young age (though the jury is still out on her real age).
I still have vivid memories of this film, although I saw it in 1986 on India's only public television network called "Doordarshan".
Fox's show with his hilarious depiction of Alex P. Keaton, who has a tendency to wear shirt & tie everyday around the house and introduces little brother Andrew to the Wall Street Journal while he's still in diapers!
This is a muddled movie that still manages to be absorbing, probably because of the talent behind and in front of the camera.
You'll still be ahead of the characters by 80 or 90 minutes.
Tatum O'Neal was impressive, despite her addiction problems, she still has the talent.
When I left this film a still had tears in my eyes.
It was like watching my own life as a boy and as I still am, with imagination and the integrity to stand up for what you believe in and not let anyone take you down!
I am a musician with 18 years of training and currently still finishing my training on the collegiate level.
Do you know that each and every one of us has glorious potential within us if we'd just listen to the still small voice within?
Now about the story  **********WARNING - SPOILERS ************  The story wasn't bad, especially the whole inner confrontation part, but it still left a lot to be desired.
If you still have an inner child, and an imagination that has not been beaten out of you by the "practical and mature" world, then you will love this movie.
A day after seeing it, I find that specific shots of their faces still glow in mind like pieces of a mosaic.
They're multifaceted, exposed in greater detail as the film goes on, and they all take emotional journeys, becoming larger and different, if still humanly flawed, from who they were at the start.
But overall I thought this movie was very powerful and am still wondering why the critics have been so unkind to it.
One moment Henry is throwing the suit & tie clad Young Republican into the pool; the next moment he's bonding with him and hiring him a hooker when he learns he's still a virgin.
Have to say...even cut up as it was the first time I saw it, it was still a 10.
Though made before the WTC crashed, this is still a good reflection on highjacking and "sub-jacking".
The interaction between Wolf and Grandma is more conventional than the rest of the film, but still enjoyable.
While it isn't quite as funny as SWINGSHIFT, it is the first of its kind and because of that it still is one of the best of the era.
Look for it on TV (yes it does still get shown, in the UK at least) or even better, go see it at the movies.
He knew what Elizabeth thought of him(or if he didn't, he had a pretty good idea) and yet he still pursued her.
The casting is fabulous as are the dresses and I could watch it over and over and still watch it again.
This movie is still by far the best adaptation of this book.
While Mrs. Bennet wasn't the most agreeable person in the world, I believe that she has been represented better in the movie version because while still being a hyperactive, over-emotional woman, she was aware her daughters would be left destitute if they did not marry well.
The Elizabeth in the movie is lovely, so is Mr. Darcy, but still not good enough to outperform Ehle and Colin whom I discovered in a searching for more P&P information.
Unlike the movie, the plot of this miniseries keeps faithful to the novel but still refreshes us with a few new scenes those are absolutely natural and are definitely an enhancement.
When my video tape was wrecked from rewinding, I finally got myself the DVD... and still love to watch it.
The actors are awesome - Colin Firth is and will be the one and only Darcy, and Jennifer Ehle was a wonderful Elizabeth - spirited, lively, yet still always within decorum ( only that her skirts were " 6 inches deep in mud, I assure you").
However, I have never found another film that I love to watch as many times as I can watch Pride and Prejudice, and it still moves me the same each time.
A bit wacky, but still a nice little throwback.
still, this is a totally enjoyable flick.
The sets are standard Japanese action sort of sets but they have that certain charm about them that's easy on the eyes, it locks the film into this particular recognizable genre but still stands on its own two feet as a film.
Usually I like to comment on shots that continue movement but a certain frame, frozen or still moving, is my favourite of a film.
Though many times plenty of guests are conservative like Dick Morris, Ann Coulter and other republicans still the interviews are balanced out when liberal host Alan Colmes ask them the tough questions and he tries to engage them into debate.
Ten minutes in I was wondering if the National Organization of Women was still around; want to apprise them of this film--in ways that frequently clench my teeth continuous reduction of women to cheesecake in order to generate men's interests.
With a supposed budget of about $250,000 this was pretty damned low budget & in a way they did OK with the meagre amount they had but it's still not a very good film.
Overall, this movie is pretty bad, but still entertaining enough to keep you watching.
Her and Fatty still get found and ate.
Luckily for me, I still managed to see 'Lady Snowblood' before 'Kill Bill'.
The camera is shaky at times, and the action is often hard to distinguish, but any fan of 'Kill Bill' or the classic samurai movies should still be able to appreciate it.
'Lady Snowblood' isn't just a revenge story, but its still a a damn good revenge story - 9/10
But that still wouldn't explain why it was hungry so much.
You would think they would be still in a state of emotional shock and feeling depressed about the horrific loss of their friends...
I saw it again recently and while it had perhaps lost a little of its luster I thought it was still pretty funny.
Trained from childhood to avenge the deaths of her mother, father and brother, by 1894, armed only with a sword hidden in her parasol handle, she is ready to exact retribution from the three killers still living.
I was a great Hill Street fan (still am), but it was sanitized for TV, and much less like the real thing because of needing to maintain a plot line.
It's not a mind blowing twist like the one involving James and how his wife really died in "Silent Hill 2" but it's still pretty damn good.
It still has all the weird sound effects mixed with orchestral and electronic instruments which provides for some really creepy music that enhances the scare factor.
It won't work everywhere, still, it will when you have to, as the video-game won't always automatically do so.
Although I marginally liked Kill Bill better, this is still an extremely good movie that I think everyone should see.
I still can't figure out why any self-respecting person would ever attempt to make a film that is as stupid as In The Woods.
When I first saw this cartoon, hearing an old tradition song issuing forth in the dulcet tones of Porky Pigs had me rolling on the floor and it still makes me laugh like a loon to this day.
Maybe "Robin Hood Daffy" isn't the greatest cartoon from the Mel Blanc/Chuck Jones crowd, but it's still great.
25 years have passed since the original airing and upon review, they're still great!
But still, it didn't really bother me since I was enjoying this damn movie so much!
As one who loves movies but who can still acknowledge his limitations when it comes to sitting still for ungodly lengths of times, I really must take my hat off to all those hardy souls who rose to the challenge and went to see this film at their local bijous.
Although it doesn't quite achieve the emotional resonance, thematic depth, and ingenious creativity of a true miniseries masterpiece like "Six Feet Under" (though, at times, it comes close), "The Best of Youth" still offers much to hold the viewer's attention throughout its exhaustive (though never exhausting) length.
But the biggest complaints to voice would be the lack of general thematic focus, and the fact that the majority of the better material in the story is told in the first half and the second, while still good, really doesn't work as compelling stuff.
It's still good, but you feel like the better years have passed.
But of course, I still realize that the key to great drama is the characters - and they make this epic Italian miniseries-turned-movie work, and work beautifully at that.
It's 1AM on a weekday, and more than a year after watching this movie for the third time, I'm still haunted by it, like an overwhelming memory that won't fade.
Also, its nice to know 70's Italian movie icon, Adriana Asti still keep that elegance.
Like all the masterpiece I mentioned above, this film come with some memorable scene   (Warning - Spoiler)   Matteo jumps from window - its so abrupt but still make sense, its so realistic -his face are painful before and such a quiet pain he shows that night without any big speech.
Not like Hollywood film, this scene doesn't come with any sentimental big music or emotional speech (actually its speechless), its very subtle, still so strongly moving... Giulia met Sarah at church after she released, and Sarah asked Giulia to play church's organ...   (Spoiler end)  Actually, if you don't want show your friends/family your crying/sobbing face, you should avoid this film all the cost, its that moving, so powerful.
Having just returned at 2 am from a festival showing of the movie that started at 5:30, I still can think of nothing but looking for anything and everything about this exceptional film that I came across more or less by accident.
Early on in the film, young mental patient Giorgia, whom Matteo is charged with taking for walks while he's still a student, introduces the theme of psychiatry and its evolution from the 60s to the present day.
The plot mostly flows well and while it's usually fairly clear where it's going, A Quiet Place to Kill still manages to be interesting.
The conflict is not very well defined -- I'm still not quite sure what exactly the conflict was and why it arose.
It truly IS a thought-provoking film and I love when I can watch a film and still be affected by it, and still be thinking about it, days later.
I was at the gala screening of "Stage Beauty" last night at the Toronto International Film Festival, and I am still in awe of what a brilliant movie this is.
But there is still some "dying" left to do, and not in the Shakespearian sense.
The new interface is essentially that of other RTS titles(don't get me wrong, the engine is all-new), and this, unfortunately, puts some focus on aspects of these games that others(with this other interface) did better which still haven't been attended to, basically all falling into the category of overview... compared to the excellent overview of StarCraft and the Age of Empires games... titles released several years before this.
There are buildings and characteristics that are unique to their respective sides... the GLA, being sneaky and tricky, have tunnel networks, the Chinese, being morally ambiguous, have hackers to acquire further funds(all three sides have an alternate method of continually achieving supplies, so even if you fight long enough to use up all the natural resources, you can still gain more), and the US, having clear air superiority, can call in air-strikes, paratroopers and a nasty drop called The Fuel Air Bomb.
Many silents were still in production in 1929.
But I still worry about what happened to Alexei!
Yes, they have mastered gravity but they still have large analog dials.
Nick, is still not well, but the family has come together by the experience they have been through and we see that Julie is expecting a child.
I still can recall Brown fighting the head -- but not the body -- of a raptor and some bizarre gliding nonsense and a poorly executed laser battle near the end.
It helps that the extra, played by Won Hie Lim, is great at the part because there's no real sense of humor to him, but he still ends up being funny, like when he dances to that song from one of the Director's films.
Atmosphere this time trumps perversity, though it still applies that Miike's film is a work that will be probably more haunting because of the complexities to how Kyoko faces what's happened to her sister Soko.
I enjoyed this trilogy, although I had already seen the full "Dumplings" film which took out most of the surprise element, but even with the disappointment of "Cut" this is still a very worthwhile viewing for anyone into artistic horror.
Well cut from the full length version so that audiences still get the main point.
I wish they'd still shown this type of thing when I was in Driver's Ed.
While I'm still impartial to Miike, he does have talent.
BOX, being the second film that I've seen from Miike still leaves me in the grey with him.
But still, a couple of scenes will disturb you..
I have read many peoples ideas on the endings of each of these films, and many reviewers have some decent insights - but I still think it's up to the individual to take what they will from these films.
It is sort of nice seeing that the problems of the 1940's are still pertinent to today's problems.
and the offering from Korea is probably the least effective of the three but is still OK.
Shorts were you can turn off the subtitles and still understand the plot are hard to come by, but these fit the bill.
Dumplings is a little predictable and I am surprised that it is said to still work at 90 minutes as it seems very much a single idea film.
This is the weakest of the three stories, but still very interesting and definitely requires multiple viewings.
And the sound that was used in this short was was of the most intense, stomach curdling noises that are still sticking with me today.
Very good action movie that takes the Dirty Harry style more mainstream this time.The story/script here is only average and does not have much depth but the action and Eastwood's charm still makes this film one of the best action movies all time.The deterioration of Dirty Harry movies start with this one but you will still enjoy the action here.Just don't expect a masterpiece.The sound quality was below average.You can tell this film had a B movie budget.The cinematography is also just average although there are great shots of the San Francisco scenery.Only for action fans and big Eastwood fans.....
Harry still focuses mostly on tracking down the bad guys so there's plenty of good action.
The plot is actually quite good and Eastwood still delivers but the film lacks impact and the art imitating life premise is gone.
Eastwood still does well with the gritty attitude and one or two good one liners, and the film has it's moments of action and explosion, but to be honest, it was a little boring.
It is easy to compare this film, with the two previous Dirty Harry movies, because there some things have (still) not changed.
The next Dirty Harry "Sudden Impact" restored considerable tenacity to the franchise and still gave the leading lady something important to do.
Despite the film having some weaknesses I'd still recommend it to anybody who enjoyed the other Dirty Harry films or just like cop films in general.
`Cagney and Lacey,' for instance, was still some five or six years away, and Kathleen Turner's `V.I.
However the violence is still gritty, mean, explosive and openly displayed.
It is easy to compare this film, with the two previous Dirty Harry movies, because there some things have (still) not changed.
When it was made, the theme seemed more mature than today, but this one can still give you a smile & make you miss the age of moral decay which today represents by taking you back in time to a era where this humor comes from.
Homosexuality was still "the love that dare not speak its name" and was thought by everyone in Bassett, Nebraska, to be a mental disease -- those residents who had heard of it, anyway.
Tho the ending is never in doubt, and the last quarter dries up on the gags front, My Favorite Wife still stands the test of time as a screwball picture of note, see it if you get the chance, it should brighten your day.
Not the best of it's kind, but still entertaining.
When Ellen explains that Stephen was out of commission with a broken leg for the first six months, Nick replies, "That still leaves six and a half years."
Adding to the mix are the two children Ellen left behind when they were still infants.
His joy of realizing she's still alive is second only to the manic gyrations he puts himself through as he tries to deal with the situation without letting his new wife in on the news.
McCarey still served as the writer and producer of the movie though, so his touch is still notable within the movie.
He is of course still best known for the roles he played in Alfred Hitchcock movies but he successfully started off his career with movies such as this one.
Cary Grant and Irene Dunne were great together, and though "My Favorite Wife" is not as funny as "The Awful Truth," it's still pretty good.
Cary Grant's facial expression on the elevator when he first sees Dunne after 7 years is so memorable that I can still remember it 35 years after first seeing it.
Yet in Evans' vision, even in the darkness there is still a glimmer of hope for redemption.
It's still damn good and fine piece of film-making.
This movie was banned from theaters in the US, but still got a huge buzz and became an instant horror classic.
The characters are fun, and even though they've been done a million times, you still like them, plus they're very real.
Sure, I didn't spend any money to see it, but that's still a few hours of my life I will never get back.
When it comes to leaving you dumbfounded and gasping at the screen - jaw dropped quicker than if you just received a shattering right hook from Mike Tyson Â then Horror House on Highway Five has crossed the finish line while the others are still tying up their shoe-laces.
But no, it seems that the copious amounts of LSD that were handed out as inspirational materials throughout the writing of the screenplay were still in abundance during the shoot.
A movie that was made for approximately $140,000, that still manages to be way more effective then House.
Although Rob Zombie's directing skills are still open for improvement (the abrupt climax, overly rough editing), his debut is a staggering gorefest that every horror fan has to experienceÂrepeatedly!
Get out there and enjoy this rare experience while you still can.
Um, okay, so there were still a few kinks to work out.
Once you get used to his accent and flattop haircut, a slight twitchiness in his manner, and people calling him "Card Sense Jimmy Bond", he's easy and interesting to watch, managing to look both cool and concerned while still pulling off a nice Roger Moore-ish quip or two.
I is usually a bad sign when, 20 minutes into a film, still nothing has happened, and the information conveyed would easily fit into less than a minute.
It would still have been pointless, un-interesting and without meaning or message, but at least it would have been over quickly...
Go back into your caves and let those who still have the capacity to feel relish in the tragedy portrayed by an up-and coming actress.
The bombs are just the beginning - she still has to endure a full load of unlikely events in the hour to come.
I still have my autographed copy of the script!
Better still, this fine freaky flick certainly doesn't skimp on the copious gratuitous nudity: adorable baby doll beauty Dawn Dunlap bares her whole bod while bagging a few rays in a sauna, stupendously slinky British blonde bombshell June Chadwick (Lydie on the short-lived "V" TV series) happily hops in the sack with Colby a mere five or six hours after making his acquaintance, and both Dawn and June even take a shower together.
But, believe me, it's still well worth seeing regardless.
The climax to the tale will probably be guessed way before the ending; but The Twilight Zone is never completely predictable, and it still manages to pull something out of the bag at the end!
The makers of "Lot in Sodom" did a very good job in mixing together both the experimental side of the still relatively new medium and iconographic imagery.
Whether or not it is a subjective idea, I still think that 'Monpti' is the best German movie ever made.
It's still a great tale!
I might add that this was the first filmatisation that I watched and thus my opinion might be a little biased but I think that this film is still on the top shelf in terms of overall quality, a true classic.
While this film needs a sound and picture cleanup, it is still worth the watch!
You can take all your Culkins and Woods and Osments and roll them into one, and they still couldn't shine the shoes of Freddie Bartholemew (as Mickey Rooney does in this film).
Robin (Debbie James) is contacted by 976-EVIL survivor Spike (Patrick O'Bryan reprising his role from the original) who knows that Grubeck is using the Satanic hot-line to murder & generally be antisocial, by a strange coincidence Robin used to work for Grubeck who developed a crush on her & he still has it...
Director Wynorski still had the nerve to use his real name on the credits when he made this back in '91 instead of hiding under his usual Jay Andrews pseudonym, the film is reasonably well made but it doesn't have any style or the visual look of the first film.
Though, it might have some biting topics covered, but there's still a sub-plot involving Knox's niece that seems more or less irrelevant to the overall proceedings.
Questions that may have changed shape today but still exist in some form.
Please, don't ask me what this movie's about, 'cause I've seen it a couple of times now, and I'm still not sure.
This movie is still incomprehensibly underrated and unknown.
The usual action flesh fantasy for male viewers, this Sidaris flick is not as good as a few others, but the girls looks great (there is my favorite Playmate, Wendy Hamilton, that doesn't show as much as I hope, but it's still a threat; there is also Julie Strain's Black Widow, with an opening scene Basic Instinct style that it's really good) and the action is good enough to let the 90 minutes of the movie pass without any boring moment.
I had a big smile plastered on my face for about the first half-hour, which is the best part of the movie, and while the last half-hour loses some steam, it's still a joy to watch Turner and especially Mink Stole.
(Any modern movie that still uses wipes for editing...) With no pun intended (well, maybe some), it's a movie definition of "queer."
Even after 15 years, this movie is still pretty much amazing, even though it's surely not as half as shocking as it was before.
This is one of the few Waters films that I rent from time to time rather than own, but it's still lots of fun.
Also, I still remember the primal screams of "SCHWAAAAAAAAAB!!"
As blah as this movie was, I still recommend it if only for the music.
I will say that the plot twists to the point of nonsense, but it's still a good ride.
The still hold on to the plot thing, but I think they are going in the same direction as Hollywood movies.
While things seem to tie together at the end, there are still questions.
Because this is still a seriously well made movie.
But still great acting nonetheless.
This is still a Classic film made in 1958 and ten years later, Boris Karloff passed away to the Higher Stage in the real Spiritual World.
the only thing I still remember of the movie is the stupid pentagram that looks like a Christmas decoration(somebody already wrote about it, I know).
Maybe that was the only aspect they concentrated on while doing this movie and still I don't understand this etruscan book idea where it came from.
She was a delight then, and she has evolved into a wonderful actress while still maintaining a charismatic presence.
Unfortunately, the color of the Whitehouse 30 years later is still...well mostly white.
That was Miller's gift, the ability to tell a deeply human story that, politics and social change aside, can still resonate today.
The film did not have the same emotional affect, however, and although it was still tragic it somehow came across with less impact than the words on the page.
Also, growing up I always liked the comforting presence of Henry Morgan who is still alive today!
ALL MY SONS may have been slightly diluted for the screen as compared to the stage play which implicated corruption and wartime profiteering on a higher level than just one or two business men, but it's still powerful stuff and extremely well directed by Irving Reis.
Summing up: Somber drama never quite overcomes its stage origins but it's still powerful stuff.
This classic shows all of the elements of Hip Hop with New Edition (the original group) Kurtis Blow (who the fugees sampled), The Fat Boys, RUN-DMC, LL Cool J who's still going strong, The Beastie Boys, & Sheila E who worked with Prince, even Rick Ruben who's in the latest Jay Z video was involved.
I watched this for my English class and it portrayed some very interesting themes, still affecting todays world.
I've seen this movie a lot of times,in fact,I bought it after I saw it the first time and I'm still always looking for time to watch it again.
Now but a legend his message relays, be your own person and still "Seize the day!"
Robin Williams continues in stride as one who has to-date remained the most touching, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring comedians with inarguable acting talent (he still remains my most favorite performer on the film screen).
It is still my all-time favorite, and it still inspires me to seize the day and make my life extraordinary.
I still don't think I have seized the day completely.
Although given little to do, Mary Astor is still a lovely heroine worth the fighting of several duels.
this is a movie i saw with the 5th floor back in the day when it came out at the drive in .... some of the scenes in the movie stuck in my head some 30 years later until i tracked down a 15.00 copy off ebay... re-watched it and now I'm not taunted to find it anymore but do not regret getting this nostalgic scary cult classic... worth the watch BUT you must keep in mind that you have to put yourself in the year it came out to watch it not the year were in... that way you can fully appreciate the special effects that were 'from' the day not today.. because they obviously don't compare... well its definitely worth finding... pay for the copy not original that can run you 200+ dollars from places that actually still have a few... thats all... enjoy...
The CREEPSHOW films are still the modern day kings of the horror anthology tradition, one that stretches back to the 1940s with the incomparable DEAD OF NIGHT, another classic being Mario Bava's fabulous BLACK SABBATH from 1963 and the overlooked H.P.
I recently attained a copy of this and watched it again after all these years, and I still think it is quite effective.
That little movie you made way back in the 1970's still holds up well, and has a good creepy atmosphere that many of today's big-budgeted have not a clue of how to accomplish.
Screams is dated by now Im sure but still good fun compared to a LOT of other bigger budget movies.
That being said, and Bogart being Bogart, this is still a top-notch noir thriller, with some of the best character actors in the business (Ted DeCorsia, Roy Roberts, Jack Lambert, Bob Steele, Zero Mostel) filling out the cast, a dark, oppressive and somewhat claustrophobic tone, and some particularly--considering the time in which it was made--gruesome moments (the scene between sadistic hit-man Bob Steele and gang member Danny Dayton, when it slowly dawns on Dayton that *he* is the intended victim, will make your hair stand on end).
Even taking into account Bogart's miscasting, this film is still a nail-biter with a surprising little plot twist near the end.
This may not be the Warner Bros. of the 1930's, but it's still fast, tough, and unsentimental.
Nonetheless, this is a surprisingly tense and uncompromised look at touchy subject that's since become familiar, but still merits a look-see.
The two leads are unlikable, homophobic morons, but it still adds up into a remarkably funny endeavor.
This to my knowledge, is still unconfirmed, but when viewing the picture as a whole, it certainly boasts the feel of Walsh's better known pictures.
Mendoza - "I've still got a dime left.
(I still feel missing something in the story line.)
Tony Jaa has taught me that a movie can be meaningless, convoluted to the point of incomprehensible, full of terrible acting and still be incredible enjoyable.
I still recommend at least one viewing of this movie (I have seen it twice), although you may want to have some sort of medicine on hand.
Of course, you know that "Dum" still loves Rumpoey, and she still loves him, but they're worlds apart.
My spontaneous reaction at the first time ("Citizen Kane meets Casablanca") still holds.
But the authorities at home are still after him.
This delightful little comedy is a fascinating glimpse of the first days of the Jazz Age with a never more charming Mae Murray who practically cannot stand still and gives a sweet, amusing performance and then there's the stunningly handsome Valentino, then not yet a star but certainly showing star charisma in spades.
Eventually the real duke shows up and even though he knows she is not the same woman he had a fling with he still wants Mae.
But no matter how bad it got, I still liked the Under Water kindom idea and when the shark was swimming around it and scaring all the people.
in THE WIND AND THE LION) and his Secretary of State, John Hay (R. Lee Ermey), appoint southern Congressman 'Fighting Joe' Wheeler to lead the American forces, with the rank of General (primarily to appease a South still bitter over the Civil War).
It is replaced by a still frame of "Jaws III".
DUM,DUM,DUM,DUM.....Just when you thought you were safe from sequels... Comes this second dreadful,horrid,and poorly acted film.Louis Gosset Jr. sports a terrible ghetto accent thoughout the film,probably hoping he won't be recongnized.James Bond Hopeful(at the time)Simon McQuade plays a Costeuo-like Documentary filmaker,Mr.Fritz-Royce who*spoilers ahead* gets swallowed whole by Mrs. Bruce.Bess Armstrong(High Road to China) plays the love interest,but hey, at least she's better than Karen Young in Jaws the Revenge.Dennis Quaid(The Parent Trap,The Right Stuff,Dreamscape) is the now grown up Mike Brody,who with Martin Brody out of the film,is the hero.John Putch is Shawn still afraid of the Deep Blue Sea(get it?
That was the only movie I had to close my eyes during, IT had more to do with my great fear of sharks and anything resembling them, but still.
So after reading all this and you still want to watch it go ahead but prepare to be disappointed to the max.
Almost immediately we see a woman still strapped in her seat on a piece of wreckage who has just awakened following the crash.
And the rating was still 5,8 so I thought it will be worth watching.
Slightly overrated in its day, this is still a solid western with good scenery (Death Valley?)
The story starts slow but the Indian attack climax is still as exciting as ever.
In 1863, while the War Between the States still raged, a large group of Confederate prisoners were held in a sun baked stockade at Fort Bravo, Arizona Territory.
Of course the story still feels the need to put in a love-story into the movie but that's basically the curse of every movie that's over 50 years old.
"Escape From Fort Bravo" had a unique western storyline that shifted somewhat during the course of the film, but still left the viewer   with a decent film for its time.
It's an unpleasant task, he personally dislikes the job, but he does it, and does it all to well, much to the chagrin of the rebels still in the fort.
While this film isn't quite as good as a few of his later films (such as City Lights), this is still a good film and very lovely to watch--with a real artistic touch by writer/director/director/musical score creator and actor Chaplin is truly outstanding!!
In a picture filled with an excess of wonderful vignettes, chased by a mad donkey while holding an enormous stack of dishes, Charlie's surprise when he opens a trunk to find it full of wild monkeys, his boastfulness at surviving a moment trapped in the lions cage only to be frightened by a kitten, and William Tell with a banana, Chaplin left still more on the cutting room floor.
Sure, the effects might not have been the best, but it was still a great movie.
But still what resonates most with me is an example of Chaplin's ideas that great art and, consequently great humour, comes more out of desperation and ignorance, if accompanied with a good heart, than talent and coldly calculated intellect.
Yet in spite of how funny this movie truly is, the parts I remember most are still those that reached a deeper level of human emotion: the scenes between Chaplin and his lover are meant to be comical, but I couldn't help but notice the honesty and poignancy he injected into each vignette.
I do think the ending could have been much better, but still, it doesn't hurt the overall quality of the movie.
I spent a lot of time criticizing this one fatal flaw, but overall I am still giving the movie a 7, because the rest of it (with the exception of the tepid romantic subplot) was so good and so effective.
It's still the SAME CRIME!
I'll end on this note -- Fracture would be a modest movie of the week on television if this were still the 80s.
Ryan still looks like the 'kid next door' type.
I could have watched this story unfold for another two hours and would have been happy to do so, am I'm not one to sit still for long periods these days.
But, It still is a Good Movie and Certainly worth seeing.
Even though Sir Anthony Hopkins played a role almost exactly identical to that of his previous Hannibal Lecter, it was still great to see him back in this form because that's what I always thought he was best at: the maniacal genius.
He didn't add anything new to his character that we haven't seen him do before, yet I still loved watching him whenever he was on the screen.
He was a true movie star and a man's man and I still miss him.
Directed in a rather plain, yet still effective manner by TV show veteran Buzz Kulik, this movie has a certain rough look and gritty atmosphere to it that's gripping and believable.
Watching it recently as an adult, I still find it amusing.
But he's still the McQueen we know and love when he confronts the Texas ranger played by Ben Johnson.
The music is a bit cheesy and the story is rather episodic, but still a fun night at the movies.
It is nothing grand, and for the most part there really is no plot, but it is still a rather good movie.
Even though McQueen was feeling the effects of his illness during the shooting of this one, he still does a great job.
The theme song "Lilium", sung in Latin still sends chills down my spine, even after hearing it so many times.
I would also like to mention Mariko, a minor character but still my personal favourite: she is a young girl who has the same mutation as Lucy, who does horrific things to people with the air of a child burning ants with a magnifying glass.
Lucy/Nyu is the mainspring of this glorious story, her anger and her strength make her a true goddess, but her feeling and inner burden still classifies her as human.
But in the end, the feeling within is still warm, and the tears that you might shed are both sad and happy.
It essentially sums up with that despite all the evil that there is in this world, there is still innocence and love to be found.
Well she still kill some of those soldiers, but this time it is a little more than just doing it for fun, I mean by any instinct.
The Songbox still plays Lilium, but when it stops playing it, the clock has ringing and the anime has ended, The End.
Although this does stray from the manga (i've never seen the manga, just know its a lot longer and different then how the animation ended) it is still worth watching.
This was totally unexpected and the impact this anime has made is still with me today.
For some reason I still haven't figured out but already deeply regret, I decided to watch it after all even though I'd knew it would have the same painful effect as poking my own eyes out with a rusty spoon and pour sour vinegar in the badly infected eye-sockets.
Whatever the director's intentions were, however, the film still sucks!
So why on earth are there movies made which still require us to use imagination to make the images seem real, or even watchable??
With Shirley gone, there was no need for her Dad to be still around.
Or for Wolfie to be still living in the Johnson's house that matter.
I'd have thought when Shirley left, the show wouldn't be as good, it was still a masterpiece.
I still suffer severe depression when I think about this abomination.
The film is broadly about how every human-being long for 'love' and still how rare it is to be loved.
I see this film in the same league as 'Ram Teri Ganga Maili' because the woes of the protagonist are the same still it is completely different.
The quality is a little grainy and washed out, but the shorts are still a lot of fun, Tuppertime especially is priceless particularly with the vicar who comes on the air with his flies undone, and Benny is as wonderful as ever.
I was still very little when this show aired here in Europe, but even so, I still remember two shows me and my family were sort of addicted to : Sledge Hammer and Raven.
I still remember the great scenery and atmosphere in Rave and the fights were exciting as ever, how else would a little guy like I was remember such a show clearly?
I am still trying to find the episodes on videotape!
But there's an abstract quality to all of this after a while that makes it all the more real in nature, while still keeping to a control of the subject matter into something that looks out of this world, ethereal, and somehow unnatural while still being about nature all the same (hence science-reality).
The cinematography of this movie is a constant presence of beauty and terror, heart-throbbing and breathtaking, still always far from pathos.
Those who persist in their viewing will eventually encounter a chilling repetitiveness in this film (the fires are still burning!)
I went in with low expectations and yet I was still disappointed because it doesn't even classify as typical mindless action-type fun such as "Bloodsport" and the like.
With a supposed budget of about $200,000 I can cut it a little bit of slack but as a whole it's still bland, forgettable & dull.
Special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-D glasses, however, the film is still enjoyable to watch.
Again, from direct personal experience, I can tell you there was and still is a microcosm of British culture in Germany around Military installations and their surrounding towns.
A new Army wife was able to quickly fit in and I guess its still the same today.
Take a little time to stand still about your feelings and be true to your heart.
We youngsters longed for more comedies with him after having seen him in the outrageous (is it still seen this way today?)
Be still my aching ribsÂ It's a reworking of Fellini's near career killing early flop The White Sheik, even including a Felliniesque lineup of hookers at a bus stop in one scene, only without Fellini's restraint (yes, you did read that right), with Wilder's unemployed baker heading for Hollywood to enter a screen test to find the next Valentino while his young wife seeks out the real thing.
Your still on your chair!
Maybe it wasn't the "BIGGEST Sequel TO THE BIGGEST Disney CHANNEL PRODUCTION," but it was still a great movie.
Any family could sit and watch this delightful movie without fear of inappropriate scenes or language, how refreshing- Maybe some of the situations are predictable, but who cares...the story and music is still very cute and entertaining!
The formula is still the same: simple plot, swooning girls, and boys with squeaky clean images.
The cast is still strong with Efron and Hudgens leading the pack.
Of course there are the lines that are so cheesy that you laugh out loud, and of course the awkward moments (Efron's "angry" dance number comes to mind) but it's still entertaining.
it still has this good ol'Disney moral at the end but it is pleasantly subtle.
Disney still has it.
Naturally, this method of suicide perplexes both men, but still have a job to do in testing chimps for outer space travel.
I'm not saying parents have to let their kids watch Silence of the Lambs instead of High School Musical-but please, at least let them watch decent musicals/movies, like The Sound of Music or Dr. Strangelove (which is not a musical but still great-and rated PG!
Enjoy being a kid and being with the ones who love you while you still can.
A stroke of genius, I would say, except for the fact that it's still a freakin' High School Musical movie, not a Country Club Musical movie.
Warren Beatty shows he has moved on from his early Director/Writer days (Reds etc) but is still thinking deeply about what is happening in the real world.
ThereÂ´re still several talented Hollywood producers.
Berry is actually good as well in her pre-movie star mode when she still bothered to act.
Bulworth was released quite a few years ago, but it is still (if not more) relevant today.
Most people I know do seem not remember it showing at the cinema, but it is still great to buy on DVD - which I have - and it includes extra scenes, bloopers and the making of the movie.
Am I to believe that Pierce is still a sex symbol even with a HUGE gut sticking out?
Finally, am I to believe that Pierce could still move as quickly as Ratner defined?
When we had fewer stations that we do now, films like this were still being seen in the afternoons on affiliate stations to ABC.
Few of those films were memorable, but this is one that stands out in the same way that "The Night Stalker" and "Brian's Song" are still remembered.
Even if you can guess ahead of time who or what is behind it all, you'll still feel a shiver go up your spine when you see that final close-up.
The scandalous best-selling novel by Grace Metalious is brought to life in this somewhat watered-down 20th Century Fox production, although it was still considered shocking and controversial for the time.
Censorship ripped a lot from "Peyton Place", but the guts are still there-- and it's a good result.
Although her performance and her 'look' as Selena Cross were nothing like I had expected, I still thought she was excellent.
The Code was still firmly in place and had it not been I think Russ Tamblyn's character would have been more explicitly gay.
OK for starters the movie entertains me lots, but i still think that, between all the silly dialog of this characters and their morality problems resides just a silly movie full of clichÃ©s and a beautiful cinematography.
The movie have its share of dated trappings and mistakes (as a previous IMDb user commented, the film is set during WWII and the 50's fashions don't match the 40's setting) as well as the Hays Office mandates were still in effect, which also explains why some story lines were purposely watered-down or even censored.
Beautifully photographed by William Mellor and a very memorable and still classic musical score by Franz Waxman, "Peyton Place" is an entertaining drama that still has an effect on this viewer.
Of course, due to Code restrictions, the movie version was watered down, although it still manages to deliver its message.
I must say that the film certainly does not lack plot points Â there are many plots to the story, yet when it was all over it still felt somehow anticlimactic, due to the unrealistically up-beat ending.
You just knew that someone was going to end up having to take control over the sickening situation of her family life, and I cheered when (her fear still paralyzing her to fight completely) the doctor (a superb Lloyd Nolan Â extremely believable as a caring physician) came forward to help rectify the situation and clear her name.
I wonder if it even still exists?
Unfortunately, many of these events are still taking place around us today.
Peyton Place is a movie that strips away the candy-coated exterior which surrounds many a 50s film, and shows the raw and flawed lives of people who are struggling with issues that viewers in today's society can still relate to.
Here's another person strongly urging the release of this obscure gem on DVD, perhaps now, while it's still winter!
Louis Gossett Jr returns as Chappy Sinclair who is this time aided by Sonny Chiba and Co to battle Colombian drug-lords who have kidnapped the brother of rebel fighter (Played by body builder Rachel McGlish) and so the grumpy old men show up to put on a show that proves that these old farts still have what it takes to become one man armies.
But it was still a fun b movie ride.
Joining him in the show are three washed up WWII vets: Palmer from Great Britain, piloting a Supermarine Spitfire (beautiful airplane); Leichman from Germany, piloting an Me-109 (the P-51B I mentioned earlier, but still magnificent looking none the less); and Hirokoshi, piloting the Zero.
This movie was total nonsense, but still I kept watching.
She is, however, excellently physical, and would have made a great action star (I wouldn't be surprised if this option were still open to her).
Most comedies nowadays have enough good jokes in them to last about ten minutes, but John Landis proves that movies like this still can be made.
Max, with his girlfriend, are going to go round to his house with Goofy and Goofy, being his goofy self, will be likely to still play the goof.
Great obscure little made for TV movie, something like a hybrid between "The Thing" and "The Shining" (even though that movie was still several years away from being made).
I've only ever seen this on TV once, it was back in 1995 or 1996, and it was under the name "A Cold Night's Death", but I've still got it on video.
If you don't really like these films, then it still may be worth a look!
I found myself, after nearly two hours, wondering, if I had any self respect, "would I still be watching this awful film?"
(It would still be bad but at least not the kind of bad that makes you want to run off the nearest sufficiently high place, all the while screaming curses that would make a sailor blush.)
Scorsese is considered the greatest US filmmaker still active (by all those who don't think so of Spielberg).
But I waited through 3 long hours for it... and I still don't know what the movie was trying to say.
Diaz was down right fetching and I still believe she could tempt a dead man.
Sometimes a little bit too wordy and slow, but still this almost three hour film is strong enough to hold your interest and imagination.
Whether or not Martin is actually washed up or still possesses his own magical abilities with a camera I cannot say, but it seems that whatever his original vision was, someone went through it (violently) with a cleaver.
Its a shame to see a director with such a great track-record try so hard to convince us that he's still 'got it'.
Despite their differences and years after Priest's death, The Butcher still honored and celebrated his life.
Sharing the same values and only divided by faith, honor was still a trait some had amidst all the ruins.
Perhaps reminding the world despite the progression of mankind, we are still not civilized.
He gets on Bill's good side and eventually becomes his number one man, all the while still plotting for his father's revenge.
Suddenly he turns into a colorfully dressed, but still somewhat bungling crime fighter.
It's been a while since I've seen this film but I still remember that it is a good laugh.
It still has some blood and some nudity (if you watch the UNRATED director's cut) but not as much as say...Terror Firmer.
I found it repulsive, I'm gonna still try to find something better among the argentina cinema, hopefully something like Brasil has to offer.
from more popular films and tempering them with style, the whole movie still seems rather dull and derivative.
For once, someone had a small special effects budget, and got the most out of it, while still coming up with a compelling story.
*** out of 10  Disclaimer: still not as bad as Hudson Hawk
I saw this movie in Denver for free and I still to this day feel like someone owes me money for seeing this.
...but still not a good movie.
While it is still a good satire of health crazes (which are hardly a new phenomenon), the book simply had too much story to put into one movie.
This film was in fact shot in NY and NC, not Battle Creek, but they still did a great job portraying the romance of the early 1900's.
The great cereal boom of the early 1900s is still talked about today.
Some people complain that it was crude and disgusting, others complain that it didn't have a coherent plot, and still others whine that it wasn't historically accurate (concerning Dr. Kellogg's methods).
The quiet, calm horror of the scene is unprecedented even by today's standards, with the accidental triggering of one of the ship's obsolete but still functional nuclear warheads providing a nerve-shattering moment as the two hapless crewmen attempt to escape the airless, gravity deprived hell in space.
All three films are grounded in actual science with impressive visual power that still has potency.
If you decided to read this far, you still might want to watch to see how severe a phobia can be, and an extreme example of how love for a family member can possibly cure it.
Perhaps it's that crazy lunatic that killed his sister that still haunts him- who calls him on the phone, and eventually enters his house, that's driving him crazy?
I saw this on AMC when I was a kid and still remember it.
Although in my book Astaire leaves Kelly for dead, always has, always will, it was still great to see them getting the lion's share (ouch) of footage as co-hosts even if - as more than one poster has stated - they were saddled with some of the most inept and cringe-making parody lyrics.
had still been a rather impersonal affair.
Both stars, incredibly, dart across the stage with all of their usual exuberance, and, in his final filmed performance, Fred Astaire apparently still retains the liveliness of a man two decades his junior.
For my part, the film added 'The Band Wagon' and 'Easter Parade (1948)' to my must-see list {yes, I am still a novice!
This compilation isn't as good as the original, but it's still fantastic.
However, I find the material a bit corny and unnecessary, but still good to watch Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly - I hope I'm in that good of a shape when I'm that age!
Angel is still fighting his demons and taking drugs.
Angel lives but his demons are still with him.
It makes you want to go out and rent all the others... and still watch it over again just to revel in Astaire and Kelly being onscreen together for the first time since 'The Babbitt and The Bromide' in ZIEGFELD FOLLIES almost three decades ago.
It seems that Guest was still somewhat caught between traditional film-making and the fly-on-the-wall sort of technique that his mockumentaries used, as he often struggles between the angles that emphasize his points and simple medium-to-long frontal shots of characters speaking.
Overall, it's tough to read Christopher Guest's "For Your Consideration" as anything other than a satire-by-numbers by a director still trying to find his way and possibly fearing that his past success has come only because of his much-liked troupe of improv actors.
I still liked Willard though.
I bet you still fit into Corky's dance pants.
Now I still do not have enough lines, so once again I have to pad this awful review with more words.
The characters are still quirky and amusing in a subtle way, yet something is off.
He didn't change his format so dramatically that you're unaware you're watching a Guest movie, it still carries his stamp.
After showing how they met, in a grungy public restroom, the narrator distinguishes the one telling way they are similar: "the still eyes, the lost glare."
Anyway on Bergen's show, Bill Fields was a frequent guest and the repartee between Fields and McCarthy is still classic.
Even without knowing that background, today's audience can still enjoy You Can't Cheat an Honest Man because the comedy is eternal.
Even the more well known Altamont festival took years to be as known as it now is, which still pales in comparison to Woodstock.
With all the shortcomings of the era being shown in full detail, we still have to also admit that the music then was great, and maybe even wish that music today could be so good.
To see cuh an open relationship between two men was glad, 'cause I think there's still a lot of "tabu" with this.
And while I was still looking out for a conclusion that would've given the story any sense the credits started rolling by, leaving me very disappointed.
You will be touched by the movie and once you will see the credit rolling by, you still be in your chair thinking about all the impressions and story line.
It's their way of saying "unlike the 'real' news networks, we are still sane enough to realise that this whole thing is ludicrous".
I had very low expectations, but this movie still missed them by a mile.
Yeah, she's in it, but she still doesn't act.
Yet Aurora still manages to make the same mistakes we all make.
Evidently some violence has been cut, the movie appears like a family movie, but there still are some violent moments, were people are killed (mostly off-screen though).
Everything, the visuals, the literate script, with its sensitive, sensuous, heartbreaking dialogue, the suspense that does not leave you for a single minute, the violent finale that you expect and still keep hoping it will not happen, the exquisite acting of all the major players, it will all stay with me, forever, I am sure.
In  this way, if you hate it, you can still tell your friends about  it and tell them how much you HATED it, but you do have an  excuse for having ac
While its technical values aren't on par with some of today's more sophisticated stop-motion features (Tim Burton's NIGHTMARE BEFORE Christmas and CORPSE BRIDE come to mind), it still maintains a unique look and a strangely captivating heart for its audience.
To tell you the truth, I have seen this film several times and still cannot describe it completely.
In the cabin Jenny reads (I think it's from THE PROPHET, which everyone was still reading in 1975) about pain.
Later, back at Englund's cabin (no, he's still not home), Baumann and Hooten finally get it on - and are awakened later by Keach and his buddy who've dropped by for some forced copulation.
So I understand how this movie ended up in the horror section of video stores, but that still doesn't tell you how irredeemably BAD it is!
Is this movie supposed to teach young people that it's okay to search for the meaning of life but still always watch out for rapists?
Most memorable the duo Jaden Smith and Abigail Breslin, with Smith messing up his lines but still staying cool and funny under it and continue with presenting.
Morricone wasn't too happy in advance that he received this Honorary Award, claiming that it would look like as if his career was over already but nevertheless he seemed emotional and touched by this honor when he stood on the stage, next to his friend and interpretor Clint Eastwood, since Morricone himself (still) doesn't speak a word English.
However, if you ask me, it was still a good show.
The war is over and there are still some heroes left.
In one point, this film is still a must for those who enjoy water sports.
However, "Ice Queen" is still a quality film with a different feel to it than other similar monster horrors, with a great cast and some very cool moments (pun intended).
We are being told that she is a Homo Erectus, which still seems plausible.
She could just slash her opponents with her huge claws, and still be scary.
You could see she still was a beast and somehow it gave me the feeling she was afraid.
Now in terms of already expecting a disappointment, I am not not disappointed but still throw up my hands when pondering if cheap CGI is the all sum total future of movies, then I will cancel all my memberships of the evil celluloid corporations and just buy the classics and F the rest.
This movie is so good, only a classic dubbed voice-over could do it justice, but I'll still try here.
Midler's husband is an army photographer who's killed in action, but she still has his son who is played at various times in his life by Brandon Call and Christopher Rydell, director Mark Rydell's son.
But Ms. Midler still is a great singer / actress under the bad make up, so I can still recomend this movie.
I used to watch this when "USA Up All Night" was still on the air (Gilbert Gottfried and those timeless B-movies).
But still entertaining, despite it's weird morality point of view.
Then I saw it as an adult and though it was not the great film I remembered it was still very good as an action and adventure sort of western.
movie which i still remember till this day clearly because one scene with the Forrest fire reminded me of the Land Before Time III.
Eliza is a kid who talks to animals, which is a retread of Doctor Dolittle, but still original.
I understand that he needed to find out the truth about his father, which still doesn't seem relevant to me, but getting taken hostage by drug lords?
Seriously, no matter whether or not he just left for the sake of leaving, or left to take medicine to a nearby town, the crash itself was still an accident that could have happened either way.
This movie has all the aspects of a great film; sure it's no Godfather, but its still and incredible flick.
While not as emotionally relevant as the previous episode, this still qualifies as great Lost, presenting two intriguing mysteries - what's the deal with the visions, and who stole the water?
The plot doesn't try to be overly complicated but still is enough of a plot to keep the audience engaged.
Although the subtitles don't always match, the story line is still the same.
It's been 6 days and we're all still waiting.
So the viewer is treated to the curvaceous Ann Rutherford as Wally's bride-to-be, Carol Lambert, who has fewer funny lines than the others, but is still delicious icing on the cake.
It's what you expect from HK, but it still bothers me that the glass cgi are visible fake.
I realize he was rejected by the female grocery clerk repeatedly, but the loser kept retrieving his money from that pelt of a pouch he had made, leaving the tiny paws of his victim still attached.
each of the generations have it's own story, plot lacks a bit in this film, however, the cinematography is amazing, and I think that if I was to watch this film with no subtitle's and understand nothing, I would still enjoy the cinematography with the soundtrack by Amon Tobin complementing this film to a "T".
One of the morbidly obese competitors we easily recognize as the baby boy from the previous scene, on account of the remnants of a small pig-tail still bulging out just beneath his lower back.
The second part mostly ignores sexual deviation, but there's still plenty of vomiting and retarded behaviour as to please even the most jaded fans of so-called "shock-cinema".
The 3 leads are all excellent - Qi Shu is stunningly beautiful(she was the girl in The Transporter) and the whole thing is done with such style and grace it proves just how ahead of the pack Hong Kong still is.
And, yes, I know this is a 1976 made-for-TV movie, but still I expected quite a lot more from it and I feel like the film-makers could have done a lot better.
Culp is most amusing, still acting with more swagger than his career deserves, and Milner seems grouchy.
They were still slaves, only they could cope with it because they sang a lot.
But still, I do contend that this film is a must-see.
I was pleasantly surprised by how much cultural roots still show up in Black American culture hundreds of years later.
We all still have primal instincts in us.
One could argue with the African cutting but th editing and cross cutting was brilliant-yes, the insight may be not the greatest but we've never seen it before I loved that the director was able to get away with putting the dancing to different kinds of music-even the hymn-and it still worked.
(even after being robbed, he still stuck it through).
OK first things first,this game is not the greatest game ever released.It will never win awards for graphics storyline or gameplay.It's really just another devil may cry clone yet even with all these stacked against the game it's still brilliant.
The game, although rather short, is still butt loads of fun to play.
", but I still had a good time with it.
The irony is he has been secretly readying a book on how to be romantic with girls while working his day job as a tailor's assistant, back when a guy could still be a tailor's assistant.
Given that a second, bigamous marriage would in any case have been invalid, though, I'm not sure that Harold needed to put quite so much effort into reaching the altar in time: whether the ceremony had been completed or not, the girl would still have been free to marry her real lover half an hour or so afterwards...  Definitely better than "Safety Last", although perhaps more uneven: danger stunts in themselves leave me fairly cold, but there is some enjoyable character work in this picture.
(A bit with the Mary-Pickford type got cut, but you can still see some of her as the third town girl in the opening scenes.)
Their romance is really pretty sweet and, perhaps, DOES border on being a little syrupy--but I still liked it.
Really--these aren't terrible complaints--it still is a nearly perfect film.
He was and still is one of the best comic actors in Hollywood history.
His acting range was the broadest and his characters were never quite as vaudevillian--Harold Lloyd's everyman persona still rings true 80 years later.
He must of been a good sport to star in these low budget movies, he must of known they were cheesy but he still did a great job and starred in them.
I guess they couldn't afford fake blood effects, there are some movies where a guy gets stabbed and he's still alive.
There are still some marvelous moments--how can there not be in a Marx Brothers movie?
Though it's clearly a big step down from the best of Marx, The Big Store is still intermittently hilarious, and even at its worst, it's diverting.
Groucho still delivers a few good one-liners and insults to Margaret Dumont.
Margaret Dumont proves she still has it, Groucho is sharp, Chico's shooting keys and Harpo is, well, Harpo.
Margaret Dumont proves she still has it, Groucho is sharp, Chico's shooting keys and Harpo is, well, Harpo.
After all we all still enjoy Shakespeare despite not quite understanding a few of the 16c gags.
".It's fascinating to read how these brothers grew up in poverty under the wings of Minnie and Frenchie and became the comedy team everybody loves.These brothers worked great as a team.The viewer can sense that.That's probably why we still love them.It's timeless, their humor.You can live the 1940's or whatever decade or millennium, it always works.If somebody woke them up now and they'd be back in the moving pictures, the movie theaters would be packed with people.And the laughter would be heard miles away.
Don't get me wrong, this is still a creepy film and throughout there is always a sense of dread and fatality especially with the romantic plot line.
But although there are similarities this is still very much a unique film.
For me, born in 1936, my viewing it at still a tender age of nine or ten only made this little boy happy and delighted with the film.
The still very much alive, but retired Tony Martin, had one of the great voices of the last century.
Despite this, there are still a number of fabulous set pieces.
Groucho still delivers a few good one-liners and insults to Margaret Dumont.
Okay the second one was a wee bit iffy for me but still I loved it!!
The children's relationship with their grandparents is still being put to the test on a daily basis with party's, puppies, sports days and even a spot of camping, which is not to Maggies liking at all.
My first impressions on seeing this series was: "Yes, Penelope Keith is still brilliant, but this series isn't really funny."
Before long, it soon wins me over, getting better and than better still.
Meanwhile, good character actors handle themselves convincingly (except for Charles Middleton, who is too much like Charles Middleton, and there is still the question of Fenton's casting, although he performs well).
Then, before I knew it, I'd been sitting there in my recliner for about 45 minutes or so, absolutely still.
But I really don't know why - and still don't.
Sure, I'm a bit older than most IMDb users, I imagine, but I think this film speaks to anybody who's heart is still beating, and has its own rhythm.
ha-ha wow i still cant stop laughing.
I usually try to bring a little more creativity in the titles for my reviews but I'm still to speechless after seeing this "Dead Doll".
The characters are the best, but the saddest thing they've ever done in the ending was to detonate their gundams, Duo still the funniest there is, Heero the silent guy, Trowa the smart guy, Wufei the strongest and Quatre well you know.
But even better, it still had the same impact on me !
The story is engaging, the characters (though textbook heroes) are still well-written, and that's it.
Her whiny, it's all about me performance, often grated my nerves, I know that was the point, but still.
While neither actor really gets a lot of depth to her character they still have good solid chemistry and both are talented comediennes.
Years later, an unfortunate series of events ends in both the women - still BFF well into their twenties (like duh) - setting their wedding day on the exact same date.
It isn't enough to save the film though - it's still a piece of rubbish.
If you're looking for a comedy with weird plot twists and a sprinkling of humor, then you'll still be searching - Bride Wars excels at the former and sadly fails at the latter.
Yet, it might still be considered a worthwhile one-time-only viewing.
The budget was clearly minimal, but he nevertheless still managed to provide some pretty cool and engrossing effects.
Of course different doesn't also mean better but in this particular case I didn't mind some of these changes, since the movie obviously still worked out and can be regarded as one that is on par with most of the other Columbo movies and even slightly better than just the average ones.
The story isn't the most clever or ingenious ones, at least not when being compared to the best and most memorable Columbo movies but it's a story that doesn't bore and still provides plenty of surprises and entertainment, even though this movie doesn't feature as much comical relief as was the case in some other Columbo movies, which in my opinion is a positive thing.
And Yuen and screenwriter Jeff Lau still toss in a doozy of a plot twist that most American action filmmakers wouldn't have the chutzpah to do.
I haven't seen it for years and I still think of seeing it with pleasure.
It feels like it may have been a flaw on the writer/director's side that there was no clear protagonist, which would have been better for a film like this, but it still worked well.
It's a no-brainer that German involvement will be of course the World Cup which just ended last year, and given that this sequel is delayed, you'd still get to see Real Madrid's ex-galacticos like Roberto Carlos, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham and Ronaldo, besides mainstayers like Iker Caillas and Raul Gonzalez, amongst others (see if you can spot McManaman!)
then there is the whole is - she - my - mother - and - why - did - you - not - tell - me - i -am - so - sad - and - confused issue paired with the i - kissed - another - girl - and - my - gf - is - mad - now - i - need - to - make - it - up - to - her issue... and he still manages to score game winning an game defining goals.
Overall i feel the film was a failure but is still worth watching so that there is some hope that GOAL III can impress and revive the disappointment of GOAL II.
Although it was definitely not an excellent movie, having a few plot holes and a quite predictable ending, it was still a surprisingly good soccer movie with an otherwise decent plot.
Entertaining aspects like Drag Queens doing martial arts in pumps are still making me laugh.
SPOILERS and WARNING TO MAJOR MONSTER FANS  I read what this movie was about at the hollywood video store and it sounded like it was going to be one heck of a monster fest.I watch the first 20 minutes of it and I turned it off.I just couldn`t believe it.About a hundred F words,a gang dressed in drag and other very distgusting things.We still havn`t found out what the creature or monster was.We then played the and fast forwarded the this filthy film just to see the monster and it turns out to be a worm!
I was brutally honest but some people still wanted to rent it.
Even though it is the worst movie ever made you should still watch it, just to be able to say I have seen the most HORRIBLE movie ever created!
While perhaps not the worst movie ever made - so long as Battlefield Earth is still in circulation - this movie is DEFINITELY the worst digital-video-transferred-to-film flick yet to come down the pipe (notice the sewer analogy there).
In my opinion, its a movie you can watch over and over and still over again and still get the same emotional impact every time.
The movie is pure corn, but somehow you know this, and it's still OK. Maybe my lust for Julie Warner has unfairly inflated my estimation of this movie.  
Fox is doing a great job in the lead, just like he always does.It was while filming this movie when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's.He was only thirty and one year earlier he was still playing a teenager in a movie.That movie was the third part of Back to the Future, where Mike was of course Marty McFly.Now he's doing much less acting, but still he is doing something.Recently I saw him in two parts of Scrubs, where he played Dr. Kevin Casey.He is great playing doctors and whatever.
Just a once in a blue moon film but still when watch a great watch :P.
That sorta spoils it for me now, but Doc Hollywood is still a good, clean and romantic view of a small-town romance.
Five minutes into it and I can already name three things wrong with it, (1) The opening scene, with Queen Latifah doing stunts on the bicycle, Matt Damon as a super agent I can almost believe... (2) Queen Latifah in lingerie, a well pampered poodle is still a poodle, meaning a mutt's a mutt (3) then there's the scene where she's working on her taxi all night, in lingerie mind you, why???
Henry Simmons, still a newcomer, gave the best of his character, which wasn't much.
Even though I don't understand French, and my Taxi DVDs do not have subtitles, I still thoroughly enjoy them, as they are packed full of exciting car chases and slapstick humour.
Samy Naceri and Frederic Diefenthal made a good team: one a speed-maniac taxi driver, the other, an incompetent policeman who, after eight tries, still couldn't get his driver's licence.
While the core of the film is still oriented around fast cars, hot chicks and zany humour, the film's light-hearted French comedic ambiance has been replaced with a dirtier, more strident, and somewhat more serious American action-comedy feel, which, although it tries hard, doesn't quite translate as it should.
The premise sounds like one of those film that are really stupid yet still kind of funny.
It has struck me that despite the implausible pairing of Quincy with much younger women, the clashes with the management and the police, this show covered some pretty controversial topics for a 30 year old mainstream show:- * Teenage alcoholism * Elder abuse * Mental health issues * Legislation for lief jackets on plains * Drunk driving *Public health issues such as food contamination/pollution Yes it can be cheesy but I still find many of them watchable and find the range of issues covered impressive for the times.
With it's combination of sex and violence, this is one of the infamous 'video nasties' that would still pose some problems to UK censors.
With its harrowing scenes of sexual abuse and violent death and torture, it is easy to understand why this movie might be considered more shocking than other similarly themed flicks from the same era; but is delivering a rawer and nastier (but still very exploitative) movie any more distasteful or disrespectful than making light of the subject matter?
And yet, despite the miscasting of the male vampire, "Son of Drac" still turns out to be a very good old-school horror.
Although I'm still spinning from the theatrical experience, I essentially see Minority Report as an extension of Spielberg's previous Kubrick inspired interpretation.
The film imagines Washington D.C. 50 years from now, and that very prediction of our lifestyle is ambitious indeed; cars which drive themselves, home appliances which operate on voice command, holograms and highways which even run vertically Â the most wild and imaginative concepts are placed together into one single movie, and even though it eventually builds to disappointing level of cynicism and implausibility, it's still wonderful to look at and experience.
In the future, they can predict murders before they happen (who will be the murderer and who the victim) but as the film proves it doesn't matter how perfect the system looks, it still has flaws and can be used unscrupulously by someone with a bad agenda which happens in the case of John Cruise's character John Anderton.
The special effects of this film are amazing, providing a believable, yet still fascinating view of the future.
He keeps the pace up, and shows us that he's still a director, and not just a name on a marquee.
Then another appeared, essentially genetic this time and some still believe that the DNA of any individual contains its destiny that is absolutely inescapable.
Steven Spielberg is one of the few directors around today who can still manipulate an audience in one sense while dazzling and daring that same audience with storytelling and character skills fused with ingenious visual effects.
His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not bad ("Amistad"), the second bad but not anonymous ("Saving Private Ryan"), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after "Schindler's List" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with "A.I."
Then it's still all hairy and stuff.
(I even wrote to him and got an autographed photo that I still have.)
I recently watched it again on DVD and the moody background still is impressive, and I think in an understated way more so than the modern computerized special effects in movies.
Nothing original, but still worth watching.
The werewolf is apparently so stupefied by the idiocy of the situation that he is kind enough to stand stock still waiting for her to line up the shot, say her line and, finally, release the arrow.
It's still a good laugh.
Sets, budget and production are certainly low priority but the script is classic British humour from the 70's and to me is easily as funny as the best Carry On's .. and some parts still make me laugh out loud despite having viewed the film many times to cheer myself up on a rainy day.
However, because she was such a great star and actress, she could still get good roles in big films, "Titanic" and "Executive Suite" being two that leap to mind.
Alas, there are still touches of it today.
Barbara Stanwyck was a little past her prime, but she still put out the passion and energy that made her famous.
and you know, i don't think the Arab world has forgotten this period as much as we have, and we are still paying for those dark and bloody times.
The mystery of the hitchhiker and his dog still bewitches me.
Despite some of these flaws, this movie is still fun to watch as Joan becomes more delusional in each scene.
While some portrayals of this illness have been better in recent years, Ms. Crawford, the director and the writers did an amazing job for the time--an image that would still hold true today.
Her mind spirals sadly into deterioration with her mania over her unrequited love: She hears voices, hallucinates, and believes her husband's first wife, the invalid, to still be alive.
When they meet again at her employer's (Raymond Massey) residence, she wants to resume the relationship, saying its awful for a woman to lie down at night and not be able to sleep, but he still won't take her back.
Raymond Massey asks Crawford to marry him but she's still in love with Heflin, who is working with Massey.
Pulling all my punches would still brutalize this film to no end.
It doesn't measure up to "Schindler's List" or "Uprising" but it's still a relatively good piece of work.
This includes a teenage looking Julie Delpy, and a sexy, (speaking excellent French) fortyish Hanna Schygulla, in her last turn as a sexy beauty (albeit the older woman, but still stunning).
I understand that the film is still occasionally screened by cable TV companies in the U.S.A.; but with no knowledge of the background to its production it would be unlikely to be greatly appreciated.
It's still no masterpiece, of course.
i still have yet to see a movie that doesn't capitalize so much on the manipulation of emotions for the purpose of amassing revenues.
I just got back from the movie not more then 30 minutes ago and I am still in a mood I have not felt since I don't know when..
Though it's obvious that they love each other still...this movie still keeps you still on your seat...wondering what might happen next or what crazy little subjects Ben and Katie might fight over again and again!
This movie, although extremely realistic and sometimes strong, shows optimism when two persons realize that above the problems, they still love each other and then decide to fix this marriage.
I concluded that those who had never been to the end (and I mean the it's over and I am outta here end) of a relationship and still been able to pull away form the precipice and put things back together again, just didn't have a clue.
It is a true lesson in comic artistry while still touching the heartstrings.
all she does in this movie is walk around looking bored just like i was when i watched this pile of crap.i own a lot of her movies and they are all b movies but at least they had some cool fight scenes in them.if you are a martial arts fan avoid this no matter what.i'm still mad i wasted 4 dollars to buy this DVD
It's a tad bit dated, but considering the fact that it's a 25 year old flick, it's still wonderful today and I still own a copy...somewhere.
While you can see he is intimidated with some of the dramatics, he still gives a delicate character moral's, which make you feel emotion for his conflict in the sad ending.
The script wasn't amazing, but it'll still surprise you.
I still wonder what I just watched.
Well, Myers is still the best thing about THE LOVE GURU, but he can't save it.
Mike Myers, you're still funny, just stop making these movies.
You can be "dirty" and still be very funny, but Myers consistently crosses the line and is just plain gross.
Sure, most of the humor is stolen straight out of the Austin Powers series, but it's still funny.
And the execution of these so-called gags is almost consistently accompanied by Myers with the same sort of mugging grin to the camera that he perfected with Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers Â the difference here being that those other characters had moments where they really were humorous, but seeing Myers try it with Pitka is akin to watching an inept magician fail every trick, but still take a rehearsed bow after each one, oblivious to the negative reaction he's getting from his audience.
While I enjoy a good low-brow laughfest like the next guy, I still would rather have a somewhat decently constructed story, something this tale lacks completely.
Even if you can put aside the annoyingness of the Guru Pitka, the movie still fails to deliver anything remotely funny.
Myers plays him more as an experiment, as if he's still testing the character out, and we the audience are the guinea pigs being subjected to the experiment.
Whether they are or not, "Scaredy Cat" is still a great cartoon.
While the only downside in this cartoon is that Sylvester didn't speak, this is still an classic by the late Chuck Jones.
Like I said, the downside is that Sylvester is silent but it's still an classic by Chuck Jones.
I still liked the coloured one, the one that was made in 1992 better than this one.
Samuel L Jackson delivers a worthy performance as Jack, adding his signature personality to the role while still maintaining the spirit of the character.
It still burns the hell out of me that Best Buy carries this DVD while Equilibrium was no where to be found.
This movie shows that good noir still can be made and their time has not passed yet
This movie is the reason that I first became interested in learning Japanese language and about the culture (and I'm still doing it with the intention of becoming a teacher in Japan).
The story is nothing we haven't seen before, but it still comes off fresh and stable with its interesting idea, which silly overtones can feature and convoluted actions creep up.
Story wise, it isn't very original, but its still rather interesting.
Even in the sketches where you know what's going to happen, or what the characters going to say, it still manages to make you laugh.
Don't get me wrong; "Little Britain" was still good through the second and third series, and characters like the travel agent and Vicky Pollard were brilliant.
If on the other hand you want silly, surreal yet still very funny British comedy then go for Garth Marenghi, The Mighty Boosh, The IT crowd or Even dare i say, Red Dwarf.
I admit it has me beat, I could watch it a million times and still struggle to find anything funny about it.
It is in the top with Fawlty Towers, Bottom and The Fast Show (YES, Bottom is still funny).
Some characters and sketches tend to become a bit repetitive by the the time, but still, this is top quality entertainment!
You know the joke is coming and still it makes you laugh.
The new series -Series 3- maybe less great then Series 1 and 2,but its still great.I like the surviving characters the most.My favorite characters:Lou & Andy.These sketches are just a masterpiece.
Seven years ago, when I was in high school, I was assigned to read and study John Steinbeck's 1937 novella, "Of Mice and Men", in my English class, and it's no surprise that I still remember it clearly now, as it's not a story to forget.
Chaney's portrayal of a mentally handicapped character may not be flawless, but it's still good.
This first ever film adaptation of a John Steinbeck story is not perfect, but overall, it's still very good, and very faithful to the book.
If you're an emotional kind of person, you could easily find tears in your eyes at times, and if you're not, you could still at least come close to tears.
After having seen one hour I was still waiting for my first laugh...
It's one of the movies, which's trailer consists of all jokes of the movie :-)  + i cannot understand why Sandler is still used as a comedy actor.
but it is still worth watching the movie.
The casting of John C. Reilly was also right because he looks menacing enough and is still kind of soft spoken.
Then there's the final scene, with George knowing what he must do, and Lenny, still with a child's innocence, talking about the hope filled future where he can tend the rabbits.
His decision to use still  shots from the movie in the opening credits might have people  checking the pause button on their VCR, and I am not sure why he  did this.
It packs a rather mean punch and while not particularly memorable, it's still pretty good entertainment.
And yet millions of people including myself and Jim Carrey still can't stop laughing.
They act as foils for Carrey, who probably could have worked solo and still made the movie work, considering he's got more energy to expend than the Tennessee Valley Authority.
Although the movie's silly, crude, and often very childish, I still love the damn thing to death.
Can you think of any other actor on earth who could bend over, talk through his rectum, and still manage being funny and make sense?
Sure liar liar is good but this movie blows off the competition.I was laughing through the whole thing , man this movie always gives me a laugh no matter how many times I've seen it i will still laugh 1000 times and more!I think if you ever saw it you would be laughing your socks off too!!!
I really laughed hard when I went to see this in theatres ten years ago, and while I am smart enough to know how crude, silly, and infantile THE MOVIE ITSELF really is, I can't deny that I still laugh a lot.
The Mask (hey, he's still new, give the guy a break), Dumb & Dumber, a sequel to Ace Ventura, Liar Liar, The Cable Guy (oops), The Truman Show (ah, better), Man On The Moon, Me, Myself & Irene, The Grinch, and there's no end in sight.
This might not be one of Guinness's best roles, but it's still a fun movie.
3) Because Jafar wasn't killed off in the first one, they brought him back, and he wasn't so fortunate the second time round, apparently - I didn't see any bones, but if he was still alive, they would have brought him back for subsequent episodes.
Aladdin, even though he lives in the palace, still cannot dress respectibly for most of the film and is still chased by Razoul.
Granted that Pee wee Herman is not a cartoon but its still its just wrong.
Despite the fact that Robin Williams does not do the voice of the Genie, it is still a cute movie and good to show your children.
The returning characters have been reduced to cardboard cutouts of their original selves, with little charisma or energy (with the exception of Iago, who was still as amusing as ever.)
As much as I hate Iago being a "good guy" it was still a great movie.
You could still tell what was going on.
Anyway, Genie returns from his trip and brings back the laughs (even though he is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, even in "Kingdom Hearts", he is still funny).
The Genie is still funny, but without the colorful imagination and brilliant sense of humor he's got on the first one.
The whole movie in general doesn't hold a candle to the original, although it is still entertaining enough.
As rare as it is, Disney will have good sequels that will come out and one of those is Return of Jafar, even though this one you can tell the animation isn't as great as the original and Robin Williams skipped out on this one, I still really enjoyed this Disney sequel.
Even though the soundtrack isn't as memorable as the first Aladdin, I still loved Iago's song "I'm looking out for me".
I'm a little sad that the same cast didn't return, but these voices did just as well and the story still worked.
Well even if Aladdin did end up winning the day, I think Jafar is still a pretty cool bad dude.
The showdown at the end is a little less intense then the rest of the movie, but still, nonetheless, works!
), this movie is still an excellent example of a lower budget movie that really kicks ass, and offers a fast paced, action packed joy ride.
I saw the unrated edition of "The Boondock Saints" two days ago and I'm still reeling in from the experience, which is surreal, to tell you the truth.
And still, there is a sense of beauty and tragedy underlying much of the action in "The Boondock Saints," and its ending will certainly leave a bitter taste in the mouths of some.
I still fail to see how others consider this movie vacuous and without meaning, when its message about the pitfalls of our current legal system and the need for something that transcends it is quite clear.
(Reeve's) character Jonathan in Street Smart is a journalist who's down on his luck with stories until he comes up with a sure-fire bet to spring him back: the day in the life of a pimp for New York magazine (yes, New York has done and still does these kind of profiles).
The only thing that didn't make any sense is why Fisher was still able to keep his job, after being exposed as a complete fraud, as a top news reporter on his top rated news show "Street Smart".
Although the fictional article depicts no murder of any kind, Fisher is still ordered to give the court his notes in the trial, or be subject to a jail sentence.
Ringo Lam"s first Hong Kong film after his try in Hollywood is an impressive one.The plot itself has so many unexpected twists that you can watch it easily twice and still discover things you didn't see the first time.The good camerawork gives the movies atmosphere of tension,fear and the supernatural an extra boost.The cast has proven itself already in several other Hong Kong films and also here they deliver an excellent performance.This movie is a good start if you're not into Hong Kong films but want to give it a try,for the real fans it's a must see!
When he's returned without a ransom, dumped in a supposedly haunted hotel that was the site of a brutal murder, things get weirder still as he seems to have developed an entirely different personality.
Lam is still a director to be reckoned with and he's still adding gems to a resume that already contains such classics as _City on Fire_ and _Full Contact_.
Although the film is lacking here and there, I still liked it.
I have reviewed a lot of flicks that doesn't contain the red stuff but still deliver the horror in some way.
Not my cup of tea but still some people are hunting this one down so I should be lucky to have found it.
I looked it up on IMDb hoping that it might still be available on video.
It is ridiculous that Jesse is displayed as being smarter than any of the federal agents shown in this movie, but it's still funny, in an unintentional away.
The film fleshes out the back story of the Ring trilogies' demon / troubled soul, Sadako, (played by Yukie Nakama), following her attempts to join an acting troupe and at the same time cope with her troubled psyche and the events of her mysterious past that still engulf her.
This could, arguably, be a good thing as it still leaves a veil of mystery over the first two films.
Over all not a bad prequel, which still leaves most of the questions unanswered, but whether you see that as a good or bad thing is up to you...
Growing up I had long loved a film called "Curse of the Screaming Dead" and still think it's a pretty decent flick (okay it's crap but it's crap I like).
The men aren't bad either, as while Robert Mitchum's son Christopher is a little too naive looking for my liking; he still plays his part well.
It's still extremely gory and sadistic, but the storyline is more reminiscent to those typical Italian Godfather rip-offs of the early 70's, with relentless mob bosses violently eliminating their competitors in order to become the only reigning king of crime in a certain city.
His extendedly depicted agony is still horrifying, even though the make-up effects are cheap and very cheesy.
I don't really understand why this film is still so obscure, especially with the recent revival of euro-crime cinema, which put several other highlights of the sub genre on DVD, like "Almost Human" and "Rabid Dogs".
Vitti appears in at least 8 different outfits with lush color and dresses that worn nowadays would still be impressive.
If movie studios are going to get celebrities to be the voices of characters and are still willing to persist with silly songs - the least they could do is make the actual actors sing the songs - or alternatively let the singers SPEAK the parts.
I can't comment on the score or soundtrack, because it was still incomplete when I saw it, but Mr. Savage does a superb job, and the story and writing are both well thought out and interesting.
Considering the fact this was the first appearance of Douglas A. Raine as director, there's still a chance of improvement.
I think the film effectively conveys the rift between both sides, how a war left those still alive wounded, and we are witness to the aftermath, with director Bartlett and Bricken choosing this specific location to speak about issues of that time.
He used to be funny and there are times when he still has funniness within his grasp.
"Cracking Up" in my opinion is not one of his best, but it still has some very funny bits, ie the waxy floor and very beginning.
I still have vivid memories of some of the surreal sets and sketches.
I'm still gonna find it, watch it and love it.
When it was made, the theme seemed more mature than today, but this one can still give you a smile & make you miss the age of moral decay which today represents by taking you back in time to a era where this humor comes from.
Homosexuality was still "the love that dare not speak its name" and was thought by everyone in Bassett, Nebraska, to be a mental disease -- those residents who had heard of it, anyway.
Tho the ending is never in doubt, and the last quarter dries up on the gags front, My Favorite Wife still stands the test of time as a screwball picture of note, see it if you get the chance, it should brighten your day.
Not the best of it's kind, but still entertaining.
When Ellen explains that Stephen was out of commission with a broken leg for the first six months, Nick replies, "That still leaves six and a half years."
Adding to the mix are the two children Ellen left behind when they were still infants.
His joy of realizing she's still alive is second only to the manic gyrations he puts himself through as he tries to deal with the situation without letting his new wife in on the news.
McCarey still served as the writer and producer of the movie though, so his touch is still notable within the movie.
He is of course still best known for the roles he played in Alfred Hitchcock movies but he successfully started off his career with movies such as this one.
Cary Grant and Irene Dunne were great together, and though "My Favorite Wife" is not as funny as "The Awful Truth," it's still pretty good.
Cary Grant's facial expression on the elevator when he first sees Dunne after 7 years is so memorable that I can still remember it 35 years after first seeing it.
I saw this online a couple years ago and still can't forget it.
Compared to some of the stuff I've seen on SciFi channel lately, this is still awesome and certainly wears better.
His acting still appeared as if he were performing on stage rather than in front of a camera.
Everyone talks and talks and talks as if sound was still a novelty.
While many of the porn films during this era still tried to have something resembling a plot, few were as out there as CURSE OF THE CATWOMAN.
I still dunno if it was her.
I still advise anyone to watch this film, as it is a good example of how bad a film can be and it gets you thinking how it could have been improved.
Betty still gazes at Danny's video past to expect a good future, much as she does for Joe's pastime despite his heart condition.
Some of Bugs Bunny's jokes fall flat too but there's still plenty of zany, wackiness surrounding him to make up for it.
And they have no trouble making 96 points while the other team still has nothing.
I'll be the first to admit that the movie was very histrionic (in particular Ms. Crawford's performance) and is pure soap opera as well--but I still enjoyed the film immensely.
The film is drawing-room bitchery, yet with only minimal camp appeal; still, it's hardly enjoyable even on that level since nobody here appears to be having any fun.
But here, in this backstage show biz story, his talents may still be enjoyed at full throttle.
I'm still thinking about it.
Shannon Tweed still is up to the game, but Lance Henriksen does his usual "psychotic villain" number, and we're not impressed anymore.
Ryan thinks he's still after Colombian connections to the dead man's money.
Caught in the crossfire, Ryan takes matters into his own hands, risking his career and life for the only cause he still believes in - the truth.
Clear and Present Danger is still a good movie.
So it is nice to see Clancy still respecting the core democratic values of the US system unlike so many in today's political environment who believe in essentially unlimited and illimitable Presidential authority, and that America can do no wrong.
There is something alive & evil under the water still living in the submerged town & it's come back to claim the living...
"Beneath still waters" is'nt comparable to some of the masterpieces in which Yuzna has been involved as a director ("Society") or producer ("Re-animator").
That said, even though a lot of people have totally slated this movie for other aspects of it, I have to say that I still really enjoyed this as a movie!
But it still is fun and I'm rating this on an enjoyment level solely.
How can one film feature so many exquisite filming locations, nauseating make-up effects and thoroughly depraved themes and still turn out a complete failure?
It was clichÃ©d and methodical, yet still managed to be quite unfathomnnable.
I am still very surprised that this even made it to a theater and even more surprised I didn't walk out of it halfway.
So they go to HK trying to escape these ghosts but yet there still hunted, so they have to finish the last one in order to not see ghosts.
you see it's very disjointed but yet i still enjoyed the movies and some of it's ideas it had.
Nothing really scared me much in the movie but i'm still giving it a 7/10 why?
Also, it's still pretty scary in parts but in a more lighthearted way when comedy arises, and it still looks great.
If you don't like the film's story, or even if you don't like the film in general, you will still stare in awe at its visual images.
But even if it wasn't what i expected it to be, it still is a good movie.
alright well i am still wiping the tears from my eyes, from practically one of the funniest films i have seen that meant to be a horror.
It has some great special effects for the ghost and it can still send a nice chill down the old spine, but nothing that can scare you i believe.
I knew that the brothers wanted to make each episode in the Eye films to be completely different but still stay true to the heart of the films and I very much welcomed that.
That's what I liked best of the film, I loved it's modern feel...a lot of ghost movies are always told in that classic kind of way you know and it was just great seeing it done with that 80's feel but still feeling modern.
I liked the new take, I loved the faster pace, I loved the directing and I loved how the film still keep a lot of it's religious sub plots.
The movie still had a lot of scares and never once did it let up.
In a world where every other ghost story is a wannabe The Ring, it's nice feeling a fun just have fun with it's self and still be smart and cool as can be.
It's still very good, but animation has improved so fast in so short a time period that this is nothing special, art-wise, these day.
Maybe this isn't Svankmajer's best movie ever, but it's still worth seeing.
While the ending may have been a little cliched, it still is a enjoyable movie, and much better than your usual teen flick..I'll never understand why people enjoy "Clueless" when there are movies like Angus that offer far more accurate portrayals of high school life.
The soundtrack is excellent: Green Day is at their top of the game; the Goo Goo Dolls still haven't made the grade; the songs form a nice snapshot of great alternative and punk music reminscent of its time.
It has been one of my favorite movies for a long time now and I still am not tried of it.
A real shame actually, because those short 15 minutes of highlights really proved that there still was a lot of potential to continue the original story of Ringu.
I didn't wanna know that either, because otherwise the horror simply doesn't work (unless of course it's done cleverly and subtle, like in Ring: that "eye" still scares the life out of me).
She is still very much the epitome of evil.
There is still a creepy atmosphere (just without the pay off of the first film).
However it is a decent, if flawed effort and still proves to be fascinating and creepy in places.
While not as good as the original, I still recommend it, if you can find a better print of it on DVD.
In such a world everything has to be defined newly, and most things are not anymore either good or bad, but both good and bad or neither one for which a term has still to be invented.
Up to this moment, GÃ©gauff's character still appears as the guardian of a consistently valid metaphysics; e.g., to his future new wife he underlines many times that he feels freed and relaxed.
Therefore, the final question arises: Does the reflexivity which arises when somebody plays himself still belong to Korzybski's principle or does it violate this principle, because self-reflexivity is excluded in a multi-ordinal world?
The story itself goes more in depth, even though of course lots of things are still left unexplained, like in this type of movies almost always is the case.
The movie does have it silly moments, especially towards the ending and the characters aren't as good as in the original but still "Ringu 2" is a great scary horror movie that is well constructed and from a technical point of view is even better than the original.
"Rasen" (Spiral) was more poorly done, and is a little disappointing, but is still pretty good.
I'd still watch Gore's before this or the others in this particular series, but hey, I am a Westerner.
And this still had me in a tight grip for the 90 minutes.
So she teams with one of Reiko's co-workers (who's still working on the story of the cursed videotape) to try and track Reiko down.
Still, with all of these potholes, the movie still works.
At the beginning of the film, Reiko (Nanako Matsushima) and Yoichi Asakawa (Katsumi Muramatsu) are still in "hiding"/"on the run" after their ordeals in Ringu.
Of course, he still leaves an opening for another sequel as well.
The counselor shows them this device, something about psychological distance, that I still can't understand after watching it twice.
Even if the animation had been better, I still wouldn't have been able to get into the characters.
Wendell Corey was still getting work wherever mahogany was called for and he did about as well as anyone with the thankless part of Craig, who is there merely as something - as opposed to someONE - for Harriet to fool, foil and manipulate.
And while the girls do spend a bit too much time drooling over the one guy in the film, they're still smart, strong-willed, and(in the case of Beverly Garland's character) vicious, as well.
Look at It Conquered the World, which still has the worst, stupidest looking monster ever(at least in my estimation, anyway).
When you've seen the film, you could forget like 60% of the dialogs and still understand it.
One of the greatest Sci-Fi movies were produced during this 'era' and even if you see them now again they will still keep you excited.
I still remember how much amazed I was when I first saw it.
Silly and absurd it may be, but still an engaging sci-fi comedy adventure.
Normally I find comedies not worth watching twice, but Innerspace still made me laugh - even after all this time!!
It's still great!
By the end, you'll be left breathless, and yet it still manages to conclude on a delightful open note.
InnerSpace is one of my all-time favourite movies and one I still enjoy thoroughly every time I watch it.
Several scenes are still riotously funny even for the fifth time.
(POSSIBLE SPOILERS HEREON)   Short overacts but is still pretty funny, and anyway, I suppose exaggeration is forgivable given that he's playing a neurotic.
This all goes to show, however, that the film doesn't stand still for a minute, which can only be a good thing, especially when you have Quaid firing off the wisecracks.
Twelve years and hundreds of movies later, I still think it's wonderful.
I am still unclear as to the implications of the ending, however that does not make me love this film any less; perhaps the film maker intended to leave the ending somewhat open, given the nature of the events and circumstances that preceded it.
This brings down the wrath of Driscoll and Wolverton, but the gang still decides that the job is worth the risk.
This movie is not very long, but it still seems long as the scenes just all feel the same.
On the plus side it may be good for a laugh if you're drunk at home with some mates, although it still doesn't have the drunken laughter appeal of something like Python or any of the 70's and 80's cult movies.
I was and still am a fan of SATC and while I swear allegiance to it, I am open to something different, something new.
What's surprising is how many name actors wound up in this effort, with one on the way up (Connors), one on the way down (Windsor) and one still going strong (Garland).
After watching the movie, there's only one thing that I'm still left wondering about - what prison cell in the country has a window?
There is still the possibility that they develop more chemistry over the course of the series.
To its credit; Demonoid is very fast paced, but the credit ends there as despite the plot playing out quickly, the film is still very boring and the swiftness in the story's movement seems to be a lame attempt to mask this.
"Demonoid:The Messenger of Death" is an entertaining and bizarre Mexican horror flick about a mine proprietor(Roy C. Jensen),his gorgeous wife (Samantha Eggar) and the hand case found by them in an underground mine chamber.During the night the dust turns back into a flying hand,which promptly starts possessing people.Admittedly this crazy horror flick is really bad,but I had lots of fun watching it.Its premise is similar to Oliver Stone's "The Hand":a possessed severed hand is stalking people.The possession of the left hand creates the opportunities for many bizarre scenes:a hand literally catching the train,fortune hunter dynamites his own mine- with his entire crew still inside it and a policeman pulls his pistol on a surgeon and insists the MD amputate the cop's arm sans anesthesia to name only a few.Watch "Demonoid" as soon as possible.7 out of 10.
The acting was OK & you have to consider the fact that it's very hard to convincingly fight your own hand while it's still attached to your arm, isn't it?
Even though the story is pretty bad, I still got interested in it and I was excited to see what happened next which is a testament to Corman's technical skill in handling material.
In this hoped for "revival" of the Blaxploitation genre, you have the superstars of Black '70s cinema: Jim Brown (always with the biggest gun with the longest barrel), Jim Kelly (who I always thought was a posturing joke), Richard Roundtree (still looking good post-Shaft), and Fred "Da Hammer" Williamson (so cool, he has ice dripping down his back!).
Fred still cranks out his Po Boy Productions straight to video flicks, but I will say he still does well in Europe.
That fact that Jim Brown, Jim Kelly, Richard Roundtree and Joe Spinell show up while the movie still sucks does.
That is why misanthropes like Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain are still read and beloved today.
This was a very ingeniously performed routine that took a shot at all the ills of pop-culture, the morbid curiosity of your average person, and ultimately the extreme human behavior(exclusive to us so-called "civilized" beings) that shows how primitive we really are...  And for those of you that don't think there's punchlines how 'bout when he talks 'bout "scarfing" and throws in the pun, "think of how many kids are trying to pull this one off" Also he touches on several current topics like obesity, stupidity, and consumerism that are just becoming too much of an issue to ignore, I mean the whole "pretty soon all you'll need to get into college is a pencil" is so true, I mean I know that i'm not as "enlightened" or "educated" as I should be and I know that if I had the same study habits/dedication towards school just 20yrs ago there's no way I'd be able to get a college degree but now i'm just a couple months away from graduating college, just going to show that they're definitely lowering the standards, I mean I'm no dummy either, but still, getting into and graduating college is becoming less of a big deal 'cause the best way to help "educate" the ppl is to lower the standards....
Extremely few comedians are successful, even fewer for more than a year or two and the majority of those few that are still working the large venues, who prove themselves to be other than just some flash-in-the-pan dressed up in an ill-fitting suit of success by an aggressive publicity team and a gullible, entertainment starved audience; usually build their careers on one or two jokes that they've turned into their shtick: they have a quirky personality that is charming or, at least, familiar.
What's worse is that for the most part, these fictions are still taught to American schoolchildren.
The film concludes with a vignette called "The Gift" about Chief Joseph, still another powerful example of how we misunderstood Native American culture.
I just finished watching A Black Woman Speaks and I'm still crying.
Well, believe it or not, the problem is that the plot isn't all that compelling but the characters are so well-crafted that the film is still outstanding!!
I think for a modern audience the best things in the movie come from Toland (the movie really looks good, the guy truly had the eye of a painter) and for Wayne who is not necessarily great in his impersonation of a Sweede as he ain't holdin' a gun in his hand and he ain't chassin' no Apache or Comanche but he's doing a good job still.
If you ignore all these aspects, you still have a poor film because the film had such poor production values.
I still couldn't figure out why not dump salt in the north of Atlantic to artificially regulate temperature?
Nowadays the average Rothrock fight scene looks very conventional, while of course still remaining sexy by the sheer fact she is kicking booty.
I must admit I'm disappointed in the film, though can still justify a decent score.
But it's still a decent action movie and any fan of Yuen Biao in particular really needs to see it.
But, since this was a first season episode, it may have been filmed before Leonard Nimoy had fully come to understand his character and the proper way to play him, (for example, he was still speaking with that put-on British accent like when he pronounces the word command as "commond").
Clearly, this is not the more controlled Mr. Spock we would see in later episodes like "The Doomsday Machine", but it's still a good performance and the script provides an interesting set of problems to watch the usually unflappable character try and overcome.
Tom can still play Magnum and the rest of the cast can still come back.
Aside from the Higgins/Hillerman character, it is very much entrenched with the style and vogue of the era which still relied on the tried-and-true formula of good versus bad in a singular storyline, unlike the West Wing and other shows whose writers recognized the need for overlapping non-linear stories which may or may not be resolved by the end.
But she still wanted him regardless, and maybe that's why the show is a little bit dated today.
I like the dark overtones of the fact that these Vietnam Vets are still coming to terms with their experiences.
Tom Selleck and cast are utterly delightful, and I think this show is quite underrated, because when you take away the car chases there are still first and foremost good story lines and good writing.
You can argue weather the mystery of Sadako is better left untouched, but the fact still remains; this is a good movie.
While it's not as moody as Ring, Ring 0 still has some very good horror scenes and some smart camera-work.
To me they should be regarded as the "super-race" for the sheer fact that they, along with the Buffalo, after being not only marginalized, tokenized, robbed, and yes, decimated almost to literal extinction (remember, even the kids and babies were shot by the U.S. army), they, into the new millennium are still here and their numbers have increased (as of the year 2000 there are about 2 and 1/2 million Native Americans alive today).
Of course they're the poorest demographic in the country, worse than that of other minorities, comparatively speaking, and still are facing repression and other forms of harassment and forced relocation by the U.S. government (now empire).
The good note is that films such as these shed light on the true nature of the Indigenous American as well as expose the inhumane and inhuman treatment (which exists TO THIS DAY) that they have endured on soil that belonged and by human rights still belongs to them.
But there is hope for many because the roots of them and the old stories are still there.
I am not a native american (or even american, I'm european) but still it was very nice to get to see "the other side of the story".
Not as gritty or violent as Ritchie's work, Bodywork does still have a nice mix of eccentric secondary characters that make this film a lot of fun.
We (parents, siblings and autistic children) are still waiting for the definitive movie, that will open the world's eyes.
Can you still be kind and tolerant, acting reasonably towards a strapping young man who, unknown to you, is autistic?
And for those who have seen Darjeeling Limited and are still asking themselves what it was all about or what was the point of this movie, it is essentially an allegorical tale of how rewarding your life can be if you are willing to open up your mind, enjoy life and above all explore the world and the people around you.
Still Wes Anderson at his weakest is still more interesting to watch than many at their best.
Jack is the youngest still hung up on a ex-girlfriend back in Paris, but has no problem having a quickie with Rita, the stewardess on the train.
The pretentious feeling of Life Aquatic is still there but this time no Bill Murray to save the day.
It's still perhaps an arbitrary and whimsical setÂand has the kind of bright pastel colors Anderson likesÂbut this time, as Brody has said about the shoot, they were learning to "live in the moment," just letting things happen, and using whatever they observed of Indian life as elements in the film.
Despite its relocation from the suburbs, or more recently, the deep blue sea, it's still a film about a dysfunctional family and their endeavours to become...slightly more functional.
People can be privileged and disaffected AND still be beautiful and intriguing.
This move is a mostly funny mostly naked satire of sexuality of the times, circa 1970, that still holds up today.The bodies are perfect and most of the gags are right on the money.It was written by some of the best writers of this century and the acting is superb.The dance numbers are some of the most innovative ever choreographed and the people are naked--isn't that what your always wanted to see in a modern dance routine anyway!Be sure to check out the "Sex Clinic" sketch, it will leave you in stitches!
Calcutta was a clear sign of the times, and still is a pleasure to watch.
In the Victorian London, the botanist Irwin Molyneux (Michel Simon) and his wife Margaret Molyneux (FranÃ§oise Rosay) are bankrupted but still keeping the appearance due to the successful crime novels written by Irwin under the pseudonym of Felix Chapel.
Best of all is Carne's style, completely unrestrained, unafraid to go for 'gag'-like effects (the mugging of dandies for buttonholes is particularly piquant), beavering through fairy-tale sets that do for London what TOP HAT did for Venice, completely at ease with the farce, yet still pulling off evocative shots that reveal the emotional reality behind the nonsense.
Slow at times but worth the effort and the movie is totally in the tradition of Peter Jackson, the movie isn't really the greatest Troma movie there is cause that honor goes to "The Toxic Avenger" but it's still a good and fun horror comedy.
The new interface is essentially that of other RTS titles(don't get me wrong, the engine is all-new), and this, unfortunately, puts some focus on aspects of these games that others(with this other interface) did better which still haven't been attended to, basically all falling into the category of overview... compared to the excellent overview of StarCraft and the Age of Empires games... titles released several years before this.
There are buildings and characteristics that are unique to their respective sides... the GLA, being sneaky and tricky, have tunnel networks, the Chinese, being morally ambiguous, have hackers to acquire further funds(all three sides have an alternate method of continually achieving supplies, so even if you fight long enough to use up all the natural resources, you can still gain more), and the US, having clear air superiority, can call in air-strikes, paratroopers and a nasty drop called The Fuel Air Bomb.
Even after getting it still leads to one vary stereo typical ending for a stereo typical horror movie.
At various points during this film, I noted the time, and thought "Well, I'm still waiting for something to happen".
I still own it from the original release, and only one of the rental stores (family owned) in my area has a copy.
How can you walk a mile in someone else's shoes without unavoidably still wearing your own socks (perceptions).
I still recommend it for those who are into teen movies with an edge.
What many filmmakers only dream or fantasize doing... Troma is one of the world's leading, and only still truly, independent sources of films.
The first hands him a machine gun and suggests (in a more overt fashion than, but still in the mood of, Agatha Christie's And Then There Were None) that he kill himself to spare him the agony of being viciously ripped apart.
Jason Scott Lee is as good as ever as Uffizi, Jason London is cool as hell as Luke, Rutger Hauer proves that Buffy The Vampire Slayer was not his best and is great as Dracula (although I still would have loved to see Gerard Butler return from Dracula 2000).
Dracula in part two was a new actor, but one still fairly young and seductive looking, and able to appear menacing.
shouldn't it still be Stephen Billington?)
You can notice that part when "Dracula" puts his "sword" on Uffizi's neck and say "You can still save her you know, have all you've been denied, but are you worthy?"
The first movie, although it did contain some really bad and ridiculous elements, still was pretty entertaining imo.
Isn't this still supposed to be a horror movie?
It is all modern and yet it still feels like a 19th/20th century run country (in parts of it anyway).
He is such a strong target for the right and even moderates and a handful of liberals that he still remains a potent poster child for spreading lies and propaganda.
Even if you hate MM, and really disagree with everything he's ever made, you should still agree that his films are a voice that is allowed to be heard.
The deaths, which are grisly and at times humorous are still effective.
It didn't totally live up to the hype as being 10 times the movie Diabolical Daddies is but it was still pretty good.
The original "Ringu" (1998) is a truly creepy, modern-day Japanese horror classic; its sequel, "Ringu 2" (1999), is a sometimes confusing anticlimax of sorts, but still quite fun, nevertheless.
The story, though embellished somewhat from the truth, still carries an important message of simple humanity and dignity.
Merrick's response is of a man who knew the answer all along but still allows himself the indulgence to dream.
His transformation into a gentrified version of his erstwhile sawdust and calliope music carnival persona still has the same effect on others.
I can still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over the audience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the big screen.
Even though, since... i've seen hundreds of gory films, but this one is still implanted in my head, possibly because it was my first.
The first 30 minutes are rather tame in the gore-department, but still amusing because of the hilariously inept acting and crazy character drawings.
I still can't feature Burt as a Mexican, though.
The movie is well acted by Dennis Quaid & Jim Caviezel who are stuck in 1969 & 1999 respectively, we see John (Caviezel), a NYPD Homicide officer who is still traumatized by the death of his dad (Quaid), a heroic firefighter.
It teaches love and does so without relying on the tension of plot because as I discovered, it still works after ten viewings when the end is not in doubt and "what happens next" isn't why your eyes are fixed on the screen.
The reason you watch yet again, still eager, is simple.
I think the ending of the movie could be improved, but I still highly recommend seeing this film.
That maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human?
But still, what he does is wrong.Leaving his wife, his beautiful and sweet wife like that is just wrong.But in the last image of the film you can see some kind of regret on the man's face.He's just married Kelly and he starts humming Close To You, that was played on his wedding with Lila.This movie made me laugh several times.Like the time Lenny lays out all his cards for Kelly's dad wanting to marry his daughter.Guess twice how the old man feels about that.The Heartbreak Kid is a real treat.Everybody should see it.
I heard Cybil say in an interview not all that long ago that she always wished they'd done a sequel to it, and that she was still open to the possibility.
As it stands, the last half hour is still the best part.
We finally unravel much of the mystery behind Sadako (although there are a lot of questions that could still be answered), and gain insight into some of the events and comments in the first two-thirds of the film, which otherwise can seem cryptic (it pays to rewatch the first hour after the film is over--I enjoyed it more the second time).
There are some great pieces of dialogue and some good set pieces, yes some of the acting is wooden and some of the action-fighting sequences are a bit crappy but they are still 10 out of 10 enjoyable.
Yet sadder still, is their friend with a video-camera who's followed them around as they playact like little kids- bored during the summer holidays.
of course not... still I liked it better than at least one huge blockbuster I saw recently.
I must admit that I saw this film on a digital projector and the image was somewhat murky (I blame the projection on that), but it was still immediately apparent that this film holds a wealth of visual potential.
(I have not watched this film in over 10 years but I still enjoy remembering it.)
there were so many scenes in the movie that made me feel physically ashamed for everybody involved in this production, that i still feel a bit dizzy.
For me there are still a few questions open.
They are criminals but they should still be treated humanly.
I watched this movie again last week (I've watched Leo ten time since I bought it) and still feel strongly that this a great movie that ought to rank as a classic.
Having been in the industry for nearly 2 decades when this movie was released, it's exciting to see the (still gorgeous) actress making yet another Leaving Las Vegas-style breakthrough.
It is not normally my kind of film but found myself watching it one wet afternoon and I can still vividly remember not only the film itself but the impact it had upon me.
It's been several years since I saw this film, but as low-budget as it is, I remember it was still kinda fun to watch.
And now, almost 75 years later, One Way Passage can still hold a viewer's attention with its story of some passengers on a last voyage before everything changes.
Though we take moving camera as standard practice today, it really wasn't used nearly as much in the 1960s and Fellini had a distinctive way of shooting action and character gesture that still stands out as his own.
I have recently been seeking a video or DVD as i still clearly remember seeing this film in 1972 in Sydney Australia.
I first learned of the film while studying Latin and therefore was aware of the fractured nature of the original work and was prepared for the same in the movie, and while some of the action is provocative a fair amount of screen time is just, well, rather dull--its hard to follow and has no translation to modern times or sentiments, still through all the meandering there are moments--moments that are visually stunning, inspire awe, and feel like nothing from this world.
The mystery still has not been solved, so art (this film, for example) continues to live.
I was utterly confused as to the story almost the entire way through, but I still grasped the concepts, and it really didn't matter.
This film or what there is of it, still remains an Italian Classic.
"Everything changes so that it can all stay the same" is a cynical saying you still often hear in Italy.
I saw this Fellini film on TV, in pan and scan, and even though SATYRICON has to be seen on widescreen format, the cropped version was still mighty impressive to look at.
I was amazed how it was still capable of exiting me.
It's fairy tale and magic theme is well enjoyed as the wonder and thrill to see of how one can age backwards and still enjoy life, have success and discover love is amazing.
That's what this epic masterpiece of a film shows it's clearly an emotional, and touching picture to love for the way it shows how life can be in a different order yet still it shows that it can be memorable.
It is exciting, dramatic, epic and refreshing; it may be flawed, especially from a lengthy running time, but still manages to be one of the more impressive films of the year.
Falling slightly short in the affecting drama expected of its epic scope, Button still beautifully showcases romance with the constant gaining and losing of Daisy; action at sea with the patriotic Captain Mike (who is also reminiscent of a Forrest Gump character: Gary Sinise's Lt. Dan); and comedy relief aplenty, most memorably from a man who was struck by lightning seven times.
Rarely has a film keeps the realism intact while still sustaining the magic of it.
It is quickly revealed that he was born ugly and wrinkled (not quite the appearance of a child, but "still a child of God").
That would actually make him a great father... he'd be around for the same number of years as many fathers are for their children.. 30/40 years, and during that time he'd only have gotten stronger and younger, while his mind was still maturing.
But if it were simply a matter of being Forest Gump, then I would still have high praise for Benjamin Button.
Yet he is still attracted to her.
He spends a lifetime trying to understand how his love for Daisy works and still only gets a few incredible years really loving her.
If you are still reading this I will be impressed.
It is sometimes disgusting, but still a hilarious entertainment sketch show.
It wasn't quite as bad as Natural Born Killers in this respect, but I still felt slightly queasy after two hours.
But maybe it's good that extreme violence can still shock me...
And if you thought Sadako couldn't be scarier than when she crawled out of the TV in Ring, sit tight - because Sadako's still got a few tricks up her elongated sleeve, including a finale that will have people of a nervous disposition reaching for the 'off' button on their remote control.
If you've seen them and didn't like them, still give this one a try as it's a completely different experience altogether.
It's still a point-and-click fest and use-the-weird-object-with-the-other-weird-object-to-make-a-tool-so-you-can-m ove-on extravaganza, but at least you don't have to go pixel-hunting.
They don't even contain red herrings : But this game was still lot's of fun!
The game's story combines elements of science fiction and fantasy to create its own interesting universe but one still heavily reliant on a number of clichÃ©s.
Although the 3D models themselves are a bit lacking, you will still be wowed at the lip-synching.
I'd instantly give this a 9 if only I could justify it relative to the early scenes; despite the pitch of enthusiasm I'd reached by the end of the film, I'm still not quite sure in all fairness that I can.
You can find the lyrics of this track on the Internet, and you will see why Decca Records refused it... Of all the tours the Rolling Stones have made across North America, the 1972 tour is still remembered as the most outrageous, most provocative, most inventive musical outing the fab five from London ever performed.
See it if you can; regardless of its' flaws, it's still an amazing document of yet another turbulent period in the amazing lifespan of this remarkably resilient band.
Well this is a movie from the classroom but still better than the other 1000 coming out of the same class room.
Although the movie makes very little sense going from one scene to another, it is still engrossing to watch.
Extra note: in the scenes with sex and violence (crude for that time, but still a little suggestive) have little or no sound of the people actually saying anything; music takes over the scene just like in Mean Streets, GoodFellas and Casino (by the way, the sex scene is one of the most exhilarating scenes I've seen in a movie).
Not that this is really related, but why has Martin Scorsese still not won an Oscar?
Zina Bethune, as The Girl, is a bit stilted at times but still manages to deliver a fine performance.
However, Scorsese keeps showing us an image of the Virgin Mary on his dresser and alludes to what is really going on - she is still the Madonna, and J.R. doesn't want her to become The Whore.
She knows it still bothers him and when she confronts him, he admits as much.
In this culture, still clearly under a suppressive ethical convention, there are only expected to be two kinds of girls: nice ones and sluts.
Use of music is still very ruff in this film.
This isn't one of the National Film Board's best features, but it was still enjoyable, and it is worth a look if you ever come across it.
35 years later, the signature songs still rings clearly in my mind.
one of my most cherished childhood memories,i would be proud to fly with them anytime,i still burn a warm candle in my soul for Carolyn and always will.
But Mitchum still experiences the nightmares and never quite seems to fit in.
It's still good.
By BBC comedy standards, it still up there with the best, but it's more mainstream.
It's still cheesy and low budget, but at least now they have resources to explore other locations and meet new characters.
And, the last two seasons are still worth watching, even if the storyline does interfere with the jokes.
I was hopeful after the first episode as that was quite good although still a little overdone with that annoying cinema effect they used but then in the next few episodes, Rimmer left and they brought Kochanski into the show.
While in the early series having a tiny budget used on props and the sets it still managed to produce fantastic story lines and new characters every episode, it was when they got a bigger budget(Season 3 or 4 and over) that they really let their creative style loose going to different funny dimensions, meeting equally funny new character's and with jokes about what different dimensions existed they still had great character jokes, which really made the humour of this show something to be reckoned with.
Series seven was still funny, but it was more about drama and story.
Red Dwarf is still a classic series, and will remain so for years to come.
However, the stories were still good enough to entice my viewing throughout all 8.
Even though this was when they were still (pretty much) confined to the Red Dwarf ship, the scripts and dialogues were absolutely fantastic.
Every week the Grant/Naylor writing team concocted some of the most bizarre situations that nevertheless still had some foundation in science.
Time just seems to stand still for young Katie as she loses touch with her surroundings and finds herself miles from the places that she was last at.
This was the first time I saw that movie, but I'll comment while the good impression still there.
This is definitely the greatest science Â fiction surprise of 2008 , little advertised, having been made on less than a modest budget, but still having all that a good movie of this genre requires , namely : visuals ( Fantasy II ) ,acting ( J. Caviezel in the leading role , perhaps the most underrated actor in H-Wood today !
I was content to see that every character that led me to be intressted in everyone, and the outcome in its ending, being dangerously clische, still led a humble road to something which balanced on the edge of not knowing how it would actually end.
It was still well within my acceptance level of good CGI and some of the background compositing was awesome.
After terraforming, Kainan's people settle without knowing some Moorwen are still alive and loose their families to the vengeance.
It's not the best movie I've seen, but it's still great, and every sci-fi and fantasy fan should go see it.
The ending was excellent, in its own right, understated, but still able to put its point across towards its audience.
I would love to talk to these early explorers or see what they saw and I admire them for their courage and sense of adventure, and if they still exist somewhere, how funny it all must seem to them now.
Spectacular visuals lend the film the power of myth, but this is still more realistic depiction of the tragic clash of the cultures in the 16th century America than all the Hollywood productions, including Roland Joffe's "The Mission (1986)" (which, by the way, I do like).
I was surprised to discover halfway through the film that he was still working the more-or-less small-time; too much screen time was devoted to his early years, which could have been greatly condensed.
They have managed to create a perfect futuristic world, very similar to our world nowadays, but still with the cool outfits and language.
Whatever the gist is, it's still a pretty enjoyable cartoon.
But he still played people that one liked or sympathized with.
At least, however, Sinatra could still do dramatic roles while being a hero (like Detective Tony Rome, or "Von" Ryan), but he stymied a section of his acting development.
Even if the point is to show people just how obnoxious these kids are, they're still doing nothing but raising up their pedestal higher.
The worse part of the show are the birthday girls, if the slight possibility of the party being too expensive and it having to be made cheaper arises, even though it is still 10 times more than most people could afford, they cry a bloody river until they get their way.
They should start showing normal families who maybe only have a few thousand dollars saved up for their kid's sweet 16, and how even though they had a limited budget, it was still a night to remember.
Cooper said her lines badly, but they were still good lines; Hayden blunders through a part even a good actor would have trouble with.
With all that being said, I am still disgusted by the people and money spending in this show.
Well still, this show is lame and totally pointless.
While it's by no means in any way, shape or form a remotely good movie, this delightfully dopey and unabashedly derivative doozy nonetheless still manages to provide loads of sublimely stinky schlockoid fun just the same.
Well, "Great White" isn't exactly the best movie ever made, but it's still fun to watch.
It still would have been a rip-off, but the point is the movie starts out on a cheesy but fun level, and then disintegrates into a travesty.
Castellari never ceases to amaze me with his action-packed, stylistic films like Street Law and the Big Racket, and although folks say that he lost it a bit during the eighties, the Last Shark is the only film I've seen by him that's less than great (c'mon - Bronx Warriors and The New Barbarians are still a hoot, despite their limitations).
At the end of the day though, it's still a blatant rip-off of Jaws, and the low budget rears its head whenever shark footage appears, with some dodgy models and terrible stock footage.
And 15 years after seeing it, I still have no answer to that.
If you're still reading, let's get back to the cinematic technique .
Years later, I've seen many, many such films, but SS still holds a very special place in my heart, simply because not only is the film truly demented, but it's also very well done, which is rare for an exploitation film.
I had the luck to find a sub-titled version of this movie because otherwise, I wouldn't understand the plot, which is minimal, but still explains (or tries) some strange situations of the movie.
Mother and daughter spend their days mourning over the recently deceased man of the house (whoms body they still keep around, mummified in the attic) and enacting sex-laden role plays of how they eliminated previous perpetrators.
How can a movie stuffed with such a large amount of extreme filth still come across as watchable, let alone stylish, you ask?
This is one of those rare films that shows that "extreme" subject matter and depictions can still be stylish and innovative, and "viable" in film.
Just in case you still have doubts, "Wrong Way" should NOT be watched by anyone who still has some good taste left in him/her.
At that point, I was really wondering why I was still watching this crap.
I still have a special place in my heart for that very first Final Fantasy game to ever hit the world of Nintendo (once THE hottest game system around).
Dramas such as "Rebecca" (Hitchcock) or "Now, Voyager" (Bette Davis), which are still some of my all-time faves, fare much better because technology won't really make them better; they already have great direction, story, pacing, acting, etc.
It is three hours long, lacks the fancy wire work or CGI of modern Wuxia pan films but still stands the test of time.
Yet still the Buddhist monk doesn't resort to violence.
THe location of the movie offered great colors and excellent views even though i still don't know where it was filmed!!!
I still do but if I had to say five or ten, A Touch of Zen would have to be in the top five.
Has some flaws, such as slow-paced action, and the 'video-look', but still, for a movie with practically no budget, it's very strange off-the-wall, yet enjoyable.
"Do you still love me?"
I think it might have been going for aventgarde, but failed miserably.Even at little over an hour, the movie still succumbs to massive repetition.
For me C&C is still the king of the hill but I won't miss Starcraft 2
Or not really, because he is still in touch with Luna's mother Elena through anonymous internet chat.
But Lorenzo is still far away from her, and, in a way, far away from Lucia.
So she leaves him though she knows she is still in love with him, and then her world shatters when she hears he is dead.
The graphics are excellent, and still hold up well today.
In my opinion it still holds up today 8 years after it's creation.
However I must admit the resolution to "Steel Trap" while it's very simple, is still very good, and very sinister, and for me pretty much made up almost any problem I had with it, to where it is no big deal.
The people are real, and politics is still there and does affect people, no matter how much you want to ignore it.
But the movie is still about people.
Tammy (Denise Richards) is a young college student still living with her folks.
There's even a couple of scenes I could have dealt without, but still they're in there, and quite frankly the makers of this film did a great job with what they had to work with and created a nostalgic, yet entertaining flick that is fun to watch from beginning to end.
This is certainly not the best Japanese movie ever, there are a bit too much technical flaws (could partially have been due to a bad tape though, I've seen it on the Brussels BIFFF festival), and a bit too many clichÃ©'s in the plot, and the gore was a bit too soft(for a movie advertised as a horror movie, that is) it doesn't really have something to stand out from the rest of the new Japanese movie....except for its atmosphere...really liked the atmosphere, which had a lot to do with the decors, which were very well put together.... the two people who I went to see the movie with hated it, mainly for the flaws I've mentioned before, but I guess this is a typical case of "if you concentrate too much on the flaws you'll hate it, otherwise it just might grab you, and you're in for a very enjoyable ride"  So to be brief: I loved it but I can't really recommend it...still I'll give it an 8, mainly to promote a talented filmmaker which I'm sure will deliver a few brilliant movies if he gets the budget he deserves
Some documentaries, whether good or bad in their own right, consist of so many talking heads that you can listen to it from the next room and still follow the presentation.
Horrible things happened back then and now there are movies to show us it all.This is a movie about hope.Hope is still there in the dramatic ending.Hope is seen through the tears.Isn't that, hope, all we need in the end?
SPOILER ahead When Lina discovers that Jakob has no radio at all, she prolongs his lie, so that he can still believe in it too.
In Jakob the Liar, his comedic talents are restricted just enough so that he is able to function properly within the atmosphere of the movie, but is still allowed a scene or two in which his ability to get laughs can come out.
This movie was so bad that even after watching XXX immediately before Sex and Lucia; it was still painful to witness.
If I had to articulate why I liked this movie, which is really a character study more than anything else (and I love character studies - maybe it's why, in fine art, I like still lives, too), it is because it is so true to the characters.
He was a very interesting and creative kid and I still have some of his cartoons and a fond memory of the Purple Flower Joke.
I am 44 and I can still hear the sounds of "Brigadoon, Brigadoon" and "This was a real nice clambake, ..." I have seen Robert Goulet in several plays , Camelot, and Man of LaMancha.
It still retains the quality of the original but as I stated, I love Robert Goulet's singing and I loved how he played the part of Tommy.
I immediately sent for the vinyl record which I still have.
I doubt the blind mice that produced this vomit fest are still allowed to even go see a movie let alone produce one.
I'm still tring to figure out why anybody made this and what the point was.
II you feel too good about yourself and would like to waste 1and a half hours of your life (that you can never get back) this movie should still be penultimate on your list ... cause nobody can hate themselves this much.
In the end its still an overproduced waste of film.
Even with Dominique Swain, Thora Birch, and Keri Lynn Pratt they are still not enough to save this movie.
He sleepwalks through his part as Jeremy the Dork Who Really Is A Great Guy and mumbles his lines and makes standing still and looking stupid a virtue.
But still there is some way to go before the quality in all aspects rise up to what we've become accustomed to.
The moon (positive), the hole (negative or inverse of the moon), the man suddenly arising from the still mud (creation).
Stan was still drunk.
They succeed and make it to Anna's, only to find she and her husband, Victor, were still very much in love.
This is by no means the best full length Laurel & Hardy picture but there is still plenty to enjoy here.
A not entirely successful- but still a very enjoyable late Laurel & Hardy picture that deserves some more credit.
His wife shows up and, in an effort to make her husband notice her, pretends to flirt with Ollie...  One of the weaker Laurel and Hardy features, this still manages to be a lot of fun.
It just moves along for only 70 minutes and still manages to bore.
As cheaply made as it undoubtedly is (and looks it, much like most of his other movies such as Nagai Yume (Long Dream) which was still very much a triumph despite its costing limitations), Higuchinsky is fast proving himself to be the master of how to take a 100-yen budget and stretch it to its absolute limit whilst still maintaining a stylish aesthetic, in keeping with the character of the stories he is handling.
As I mentioned before, I enjoy the American version a little more, but if you watch them side-by-side, you will realize that they are both two great shows that should still be on.
However, whoever wins still plays the last game with the other contestants.
After the disappointment of a still decent "Ring 2", "Ring 0 : Birthday" is a return to form.
Despite the main love story and drama of Sadako's attempt at a normal life, there are still plenty of creepy moments and supernatural happenings.
I still think she's a goddess and one of the sexiest women ever to grace the genre.
For others, the film will probably open up a window into the experience, and for still others, many scenes may provoke disgust and revulsion.
This is where Eddie stole must of his jokes, and most of his style, only one slight difference: Richard Pryor came first, and it's still better than anything Eddie has ever done.
I've watched it another 10 times since and it's still as awesome as ever.
still makes me grin to just say it.
Catch this Legend in action while you still can NO one comes close I guarantee you!
The story of the film is quite old about a simple love story that has been tackled a lot of times in Bollywood but it was still different than them.
Salman Khan was quite wasted in the movie, he is looking older (and bigger) but nevertheless I will still remain a fan of his.
All in all, although Saawariya fails to meet our expectations from a great director like Bhansali, it still has that pulling factor I feel to make it do well at the box office.
Hats of for SLB for making a different kind of movie, its very different from the other movies he made, and yet not as good as the others, but Sawwaria is still a good movie to watch.
Saawaria is much better than Om SHanti Om (eventhough SRK is still the King of Bollywood).
And lastly if the movie had a better ending or a more developed ending, I would say that this perhaps could have been the best Indian Movie i have ever seen...but still i think its second to SLB's Devdas!!!!
But he still keeps following her and both end up becoming friends.
The best of everything is still the dream-world like sets.
First of all after watching saawariya i still have not been able to understand why people did not like it.
The references given to loads of other action films may go over the heads of non-film-festival-type folks, but I still think action movie fans would enjoy seeing it.
Adapted from the HK serialized novel of the same name, it has less details, character development and plot but still leaves a lot to be admired.
After watching the film with a few close friends, days later we were still making comments to one another and having less-than-welcoming flashbacks of the images we witnessed.
The diamond trade was (and still is) controlled by government parastatals, local chiefs and, primarily, by the Sierra Leonian-Lebonese business cartel.
I have watched this movie so many times, I still watch it to this day.
But he's still got concern for his foster son who ain't used to civilization and all the things that entails.
It was called "Al Funzo's.It was a great evening for me, and my family, and the Restaurant patrons that came in that night.As for the movie, The World's Greatest Athlete" was and still is excellent, and ranks high in my list of favorite movies.
Our family found it a favorite when it first came out - and now that I am retired I still enjoy having a laugh at it now and then.
Years later, he's found by this cute researcher who takes him, finds out his mother and brother are still alive and attempts to return him.
This is a movie to watch if you still have the heart of child like innocence and you are down and just wanting to feel good afterward.
I brought a copy of Walk Like A Man from Amazon.COM on DVD and at 46 I still enjoy watching it, but who knows if I will ever grow up.
After his rescue, his brother (still a brat) decides Bobo must learn to read and write...immediately!
I just rented it the other night for my nephews, and it still had me laughing out loud.
One thing is for certain, the ending of the game is so ridiculously over the top that I'm pretty sure the game-series has reached some kind of conclusion (though CMI is still the pinnacle).
Jambalaya island in Act II came as a rather big shock for long time fans and still one of my least favorite sections in the game.
However, one thing is still in the right place, that one thing that Monkey Island is really about, humour.
In the beginning, the movie looked promising (when the spiders were still small), but as it progressed it got worse and worse.
Well no, because than it might still have been quite good, but the directors made such a big mess out of it, that you can only laugh.
As soon as the spider is on the loose, the two "heroes" go outside to see the helicopter that the evil guy was on, just parked in car park with people just walking past it, despite having a top-of-the-range bazooka with live ammunition on the back seat, which has no door what-so-ever, and the keys miraculously still in the ignition.
She was still beautiful, still a splendid actress.
I thought that the film, despite its low budget, was better than I initially expected, but still poor.
He freely ad-libs dialogue between the songs & appears to be enjoying himself immensely - even though the restrictions of the microphone and the static camera require him to keep still & not move about.
( I think it was Sunshine on my Shoulder), and that song still brings tears to my eyes.
I like all the comments that Ihave read praising this wonderful film the tear's just flowed from my eye's when I first saw this beautiful story being so brilliantly portrayed and with such wonderful music of john Denver I still have the sound track of the film MCF 2566 ON VINAL Ilove to sit and listen to the song Sunshine on my shoulders.
and it still brings a tear or two you see friends I myself Iam just getting over ''bowel cancer '' and am waiting for the results of a '' biopsy '' for a prostate may we soon all be able to buy this film on DVD soon   Mr A Wynne   N/Wales UK.
I loved this movie and obviously it had an impact on so many of us if after all these years we all still remember it and are still searching for it.
I still have the audio cassette, which is a constant reminder to me of the film.
The actors,the music,the script were all exquisite and I can remember even as a young person the profound effect it had on the way I viewed and still view the value of life.  
It has been over thirty years since I first saw this movie and I still remember its effect on me.
The town seems to be a very "upscale" slice of suburbia, yet still displays areas of blight and economic depression.
Lloyd Kaufman personally recommended this film to me because I said that my favorite filmmaker was Jodorowsky -- and while this isn't really anything like Jodorowsky, it is still absolutely genius and is essential viewing for anyone interested at all in "avant-garde cinema".
This film probably won't make your all-time best 100 films list, but it's still worth seeing.
Although he then went on to act in movies like Tridev, which would undoubtedly fall into the 'glamour'/'mainstream' cinema, he is still considered to be one of the best actors ever in Indian cinema.
Too bad I was too little to witness any of Queen's concerts when Freddie Mercury was still rocking the Earth.
Maybe not their best performance, but still good!
Freddie still lives in my heart!
This was truly a divine performance (and yes, Love of My Life still makes me cry every time).
The part that truly breaks my heart, though, is this: in the interview with Freddie Mercury, the interviewer asks "Do you think Queen will still be around in ten years?"
But there are still loads of devoted American Queen fans as much as there are British.
But they still showed cynics that they still knew how to rock.
You'll have to put yourself in the right context: this is not a Hollywood production, not even a b-class movie with still decent budget.
It was probably not that expensive and the actors were not the most famous (although they were good), still it worked better than most Swedish films together.
However, often despite the terrible budgets and overall cheesiness of the films, they were still often fun to watch--or at least to laugh at due to their ineptness.
The woeful tantrum scene at the lakeside cabin may be an extreme example, still it does illustrate the problem.
However I still enjoyed it for the acting (Bogart of course and John Derek as well) and for the intelligent exploration of how much responsibility rests on the individual and how much on society.
When they are done, Ned drags Sarah to the barn, collecting the three still naked girls and the two other convicts on the way.
As for Pippa Scott, she's the life of the party in this entry and still a working actress today.
In this case, it's not presented at all, Templeton literally walks out to the door to go to work, we go to commercial, and when we come back he's dropped off more than 30 years in the past, but this episode still has more layers of meaning than any other episode of the show I've seen so far.
Past and present become confused at the end of the episode, but it's still one that makes you think even more than most other...
He is still carrying a torch for his wife, who died very young.
Also fun was seeing Sydney Pollack when his hair was still dark.
Apparently this concept isn't so new or innovating at all, as the obscure (although less obscure now, with its recent release on DVD) and still criminally underrated 70's gem "Chosen Survivors" thrives on a similar premise.
The film seems to have slipped away into oblivion, but unofficial copies are floating around out there, apparently struck from 16mm prints of the film that still exist.
Retribution may look a little bit dated compared to up-to-date films, with it's cheesy 80's feel, but that was just the sign of the times.Dawn of the Dead by Romero, is just the same in the out-dated department-but anyone who's seen it will agree it's still one of the best Zombie films to date!
Retribution still has an un-beatable original story-line.
I was 10 when I fell in love with Errol Flynn watching this film on TV; more than 30 years later, he's still a hottie [grin].
As I believe we have not learned, politics and power will still rule the day for those in higher places than the average rescuer.
The Adventures of Robin Hood (ARH) was so ahead of its time in 1938 that despite wildly swinging experimentation in the wake of silent movies it still got its emoting just right.
`It's injustice I hate, not the Normans', confesses the very Saxon Robin of Loxley to the skeptical and still very Norman Marian.
If you wish to observe disease, religion, avarice, politics, love, hate and still be thoroughly entertained, I recommend 3 Needles.
(Amazingly, the renowned Dr. David Ho was also present at the screening, which added another hopeful touch: HIV/AIDS progress is being made but, as the film shows, funding and education are still lacking in poor countries, and attitudes are often still messed up in rich ones.)
He disguises him self, but is still captured.
I still think it is one of the most graphic, shocking depictions of the '90 s club scene to be put on screen.
The villain I thought was better than before but he still said BS about six times during the beginning:) The music was very bizarre but yet it grows on you as the films goes on.
Daniels has skills but still suffers from that most odious action film clichÃ© of bad acting, true the writing and direction can be some of the culprit but since most of the actors in the piece suffer the same affliction we'll strike it up to 'group effort'.
The battle between Robin and Sir Guy is still nasty and cool, and not to be missed.
This film had me at somewhat of a loss, but I still liked it.
There are still areas of the film that will have you scratching your head, like, oh..The poor lighting in the indoor scenes, the distant camera shots that last over 3 minutes (The first one takes place less than 5 minutes into the film and lacks a close up of a certain female that didn't get enough screen time either.)
However, Black Friday is still worth a peak, but only if you really like Gary Daniels, or if you like low budget action films that aren't afraid to experiment.
Having watched this movie for the umpteenth time, it still retains its freshness and charm.
He discovers that loyalty, friendship, kindness, and compassion are still values worth embracing.
Neil Patrick Harris still comes off very young, but his work as Will is multi faceted.
Watching it now, its probably not as good as I remembered it 13 years ago, but its still lots of fun as a time waster.
Even Hawn's character is dull although Hawn herself is still fun to watch.
His acting is nothing exceptional, but his 'con-man' routine is still amusing.
She's still great in this, but the film is overlong, bogged down by a buzz killing custody storyline with her schmuck ex-husband (Keach) and her two kids.
The "F-word" is still perhaps the biggest shock-value in the vernacular and its audacious vulgarity is on full display in this cheeky and somewhat informative talking-heads documentary incorporating pop culture, politics, religion, social manners and practically everything under the sun.
While the debate of how horrifying it still maintains its ugliness and the way it is colorfully used by the late, great stand-up comic Lenny Bruce remains to be a controversial state of affairs from the prudes who can't tolerate it (Boone and Miss Manners offering ridiculous rejoinders) to those who relish it (Milch whose "Deadwood" series on HBO averaged some 90 uses per episode in its rookie season), the explosive expletive still maintains a running board taboo in the right-wing conservative forum as well as the Christian collective in America (the film keeps the discussion almost exclusively to American dialogue) and how we use language in many shapes and forms, often with miscommunication as the end result.
While the documentary has some entertaining bits, including the welcome animation from Bill Plympton, (for those who don't mind all the cussing) the film still spins its wheels more-or-less shrugging its collective shoulders as to no muss, no fuss with its no-frills demeanor.
While F*ck may only present a small excerpt from a larger, in-depth conversation, F*ck still offers so much food for thought.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   I'm rather glad I'm now a member of the internet based LoveFilm rather than still renting films from a video shop, because I'd hate to have to phone up and reserve this film.
Not as outright obscene (as you'd expect) or as fall-down funny as its more profane cousin, THE ARISTOCRATS, F**K is still definitely worth your time.
And thank goodness we still live in a society where it's not a crime to watch or discuss it.
But even with the laughs that are obvious to come with such a given for scandalous material, including various movie clips featuring said word (Pulp Fiction, Punch-Drunk Love, South Park, Scarface), and even with the Presidential utterances and sound-bytes of the word (Nixon's the most obvious yet still unnerving), and even with some of the interviewees really giving some food for f***ing thought on the subject (Billy Connolly is arguably the funniest, with HST being low-key and observant, and Allen Keyes and Pat Boone delivering very straight-laced answers) with the two-side arguments, there doesn't seem quite enough here to be totally satisfying.
The first time i saw this in the early 90's I loved it and I recently re-watched it (2002) and still loved it, it lost a bit of it's surprise though.
The acting was great, Gabrielle Anwar, who has just vanished since her star turn in the Al Pacino 'hoo ha' movie, and I have always wondered what happened to her, but she is great and still looks beautiful, but she can really act.
Forest Whitaker is always good and the director was steady and precise, the director talked after the movie and he said he had unique problems on this film as it was a much bigger budget than his previous film, but I still think he did a good job.
Some interesting points : - After half an hour of watching this movie, you feel like it still hasn't started but yet, at the same time, you feel like it's been playing for hours.
Well made supernatural thriller that is short on gore but still has plenty of atmosphere and scares.
i found this look inside the life of one woman in the adult film business interesting.for whatever reason,she allowed a camera crew to to follow her around,not just while working but also during her personal life.she seemed very candid and opened her self up.and allowed herself to be very vulnerable.or at least it appears that way.but it's clear she's also a tragic figure.regardless,the film is an entertaining piece and somewhat revealing.you see someone as a human being,and not just as a sex object.as interesting as the film is,there are no real revelations.and,when you get right down to it,it's still a sad subject.for me,The Girl Next Door is a 7/10
Posted this one about a week ago, but it still has not appeared, so I will try once again...  Pornography is big business: while Amazon.com continues to hemorrhage red ink after four years, the average internet porn site is profitable within six months, and the industry as a whole raked in over a billion dollars last year alone.
The plot and Errol Flynn are still simply the best.
GO WEST YOUNG MAN is a good but yes, toned down comedy from Mae's pre-code days, but still fun to watch and not a waste of time at all.
I hadn't seen this film in 35 years but it was still the comic gem I remembered.
With the closing of each act, the curtain comes crashing down making a loud thumping sound; still, the film is clearly intended as a valentine to the days of vaudeville - and even includes a wonderful juggling routine towards the end that showcases Fields' amazing dexterity (in spite of his advancing age, corpulent physique and propensity for booze).
Even after a couple of decades of drink, he still does a creditable job, to say the least.
This is still a rarity and a very unconventional/unacceptable thing to do in India.
The underlying message of the movie was in spite of all odds things still work in India.
What is unfortunate about this movie is that it is, in the end, irresponsible propaganda to make light of the most disastrous thing happening to Americans today- they are losing their jobs because politicians have been bribed to look the other way or worse create new legislation that makes it easier for scumbag corporations to live in America, manufacture outside of it, and still charge similar prices as if it was produced by American labor, and they destroy local economies in the process by removing all wealth from the community via offshoring their jobs to India or china.
Loved that the company's products are American patriotic crapola, and that they still mean something to the striving foreign vendors.
I guess since Boys Town is still here we do know that Father Flanagan did solve the problems shown in this film as well.
- especially since I haven't watched these films for what seems like ages - but I won't be doing so immediately, given that a second set is actually coming in March; that said, of the 10 films included, only 1 will be a first-time viewing for me - THE DAWN PATROL (1938) - but it would still be great to have these childhood favorites readily available on the new medium (rather than in the worn, and often colorized, prints I've had to make do with up till now)!
It has been pointed out that later in its run it began to unravel, and this is non unusual for any series, but this affectionate homage to both the characters and the earlier series is a fun romp that still holds up fairly well 15 years later.
I think that's when everything went downhill...but it was still enjoyable to watch.
I really loved to watch it and still do.
And I still can't believe the series ended nearly ten years ago already.
There have been other series released on DVD that I followed, or are older than L&C, but this still was the first.
This TV show is amazing - still popular while it's been of the network for quite a long time already!
While Lois is still very much her tenacious self, Clark Kent was now a confident, well-adjusted guy and was a far cry from the bumbling Clark of the films and comics.
This is a wonderful fantasy-romance-action series that still holds its own 10 years after it left the network.
Praise should still go out to the supporting acting of Wendy Hamilton, Bill Dwyer, and Will Sasso for their hilarious little performances within this movie.
This was an alright match but I still think that JBL vs. Boogeyman should of kicked off the show.
I still think it would have made more sense for Randy Orton to win the match but hell, what do I know.
The match was terrible but still better than I expected.
Not an outstanding night, but i was very surprised at how the matches boiled out and the rumble winner left me thinking i was still sleeping.
This is back when b-films were delivered with lots of ballyhoo, and watching these today is still a lot of fun.

A hard film to rate as it's not a "film" per se, and I will admit that watching trailers for over 2 hours can get old (it took me three separate viewings to make my way through them all...) - but I would still consider this a "must-see" for exploit and grindhouse fans...8/10
I still remember 42nd street back in the day, before former Mayor Rudi Giuliani transformed the area into a Vegas-like tourist death trap.
During this time the area was still predominately full of pimps, prostitutes, drug dealers, XXX theaters and the grind houses.
At the changeover from dawn to day, in the area west of 9th Avenue, you can still see the world's oldest professionals quiting for the night.
They were not the type of movie you would bring home to show mom and dad, yet you still found a way to sneak it in.
(God she's stunning), The Hammer when he was still at the top of his game as 'Boss N*gger', campy gay bike riders, and a ton of nudity, gore and violence are just a few of the delightfully high points.
However, this is no triumph of style over substance: Raymond gently unfurls his tale, Mary at first still as she receives the message, her agitation growing as she takes the call from Simon and realises he is on the brink of killing himself, and then her flight into the night as she attempts to lay her own ghosts to rest by saving another, all leading to a taught and chilling climax.
Duvall is the brilliant veteran assassin who's not altogether pleasant all the time (this isn't the sweet nice guy Marky Mark assassin from The Big Hit), but you still wish him well.
Just do yourself a favour occasionally and let this Technicolour wonder wash over you - forget that it bears no relationship to actual history; just accept this Hollywood version of how England once was (and should still be).
A pity that as of this review in October of 2005, this is still her only screen appearance.
Even though this was a super-modern state-of-the-art blockbuster, "Robin Hood" has maintained a curious innocence which still strikes me today.
I watched this series for nine years and it still never fails to entertain me.
But knowing him, they're probably still best friends.
This unflinching look at the former Soviet Union just after WWII should be seen by all those who might still harbor some romantic feelings for the communist past.
somehow i still sense "hollywood things" in it, but i think it's understandable, considering we're living in a time when hollywood rules the film industry of the world.
And the stunts, in those days before wire-fu or CGI, are all for real and still take the breath away.
I am still under the influence of 'Est Ouest'.I hope u shall feel the same..
If New York Minute were just that, a minute long it would still be a waste of life.
I saw this movie free on HBO and it still felt like I was ripped off.
it was still pretty pathetic i'll admit but which Olsen movie is not.i'd give it a 2 or maybe a 3
It was very predictable but it was still good viewing, and i would see it again.
Lets not forget these girls are still very young and as they make or get into more movies there acting skills will only improve, but still they deserve a lot of credit.
While I was still living in Holland, a friend of the family said: 'if you want to see the creme de la creme of Dutch acting, rent this film!'
The movie is one of the best Dutch movies ever, if not THE best, I'm still thinking of calling it that.
The question is, is there still a way out for any of them.
Really modern looking films with plots, decent acting and good camera-work were still just a couple years off when this film was made.
But it still is a mildly funny and watchable short.
The squad that went to same Seu Miss (smith, lol still cracks me up), got killed by butterflies?
Yes its clichÃ©d, and yes you'll probably know where its going, but this is still a charming little film that touches both the heart and the head.
The movie explained why they had to take certain actions, but I still felt it was something that could have been improved.
:) The village looks like a calm and serene place where time stands still.
While the story isn't without its logical hiccups, it's still a well told fantastic anti-war film, having the isolation in the village force all sides to have to deal with the humanity of the other.
While the film has some minor logical hiccups and treats its villains with much less nuance than its protagonists, it still remains a largely enjoyable yarn and worth watching for those that appreciate this sort of film.
Maybe it was her director-husband who coaxed that out of her, but the result is still a star-turn for both her AND her husband.
Please excuse bad English, I am still learning :) This is excellent film but I think many Americans will dislike it because it shows American soldiers as "bad guys".
But it is still very pleasant and happy movie to watch sometimes.
but still it tells truth about war which Hollywood has never done because Hollywood always shows good guys vs bad guys.
Sure, their acting still isn't on a par with what the Roach kids were capable of, but it's still rather a warm scene.
Better than the usual MGM short, because there's some attempt at gags and some characterization, but still nothing to write home about.
I can only imagine how funny that might have been, considering the title, the fact that World War II was still going on, and that since there were 221 total films made in the entire "Our Gang" series what the film to make it an even 222 would have been like had it been completed.
It tells about a 28-year old guy named Tanguy (Eric Berger) who still lives with his parents.
The plot is simple - life in his parents Paris apartment is so pleasant Tanguy a post grad student is still there at 28 years old but his parents secretly want him out!
It is not difficult to understand why someone would still prefer to live with his parents under these circumstances - he lives as he would in an expensive and comfortable hotel (minus the bill!).
The movie tells the story of Tanguy, a 28-year old guy who still lives with his parents.
In yet another collaboration with director Anthony Minghella ("Cold Mountain," "The Talented Mr. Ripley"), Jude Law plays Will, an architect who, with his partner Sandy (Martin Freeman), has just set up shop in King's Cross, a London neighborhood that is on the cusp of being gentrified but which still is known for its high crime rate.
In real life Will could not say no when Amira is begging him because (1) he does want to help the boy, (2) she still has the power to embarrass Will and his wife even though she has given him the incriminating photo negatives, (3) it is totally out of character for him to suddenly care so much about the affair coming out, and (4) he immediately confesses it to his wife anyway.
But there also are some weaker parts of the movie, but it is still strong and great for the whole family!
I know they are still there, but I need to take more time outs from them, like I did this weekend, and spend REAL quality time with the most important little people in my whole world!
As for the ride itself, I could tell it was pretty dated but it was still fantastic.
In summary, Imagine That is an execrable and vomiting movie which is really insulting to the spectator.Avoid it like a plague.I still cannot understand how Murphy is so stubborn in burying his career.
Filmed on location during West Hollywood's annual gay Halloween parade, this gives the film a freaky feeling of even though you are surrounded by lots of people, you are still very much alone when a crazed psychopath is on the loose!!
I loved the experience and still wonder how all of the trip was possible (maybe it's best not to know).
I'd like to see a sequel, but I think if they were going to make one, they'd have made it by now... Or, six years later, the psycho killer could have escaped and is hellbent (hehe) on tracking down Jake and Eddie (who are still together and in love of course... or maybe they've split up (over some trivial misunderstanding) and the new danger brings them back together for a bitter reunion... but in the end they realise they still love each other...
And Bryan Kirkwood's surly-boy still manages to draw you in, even when he's more than a little threatening.
3)It irritates me that in this day and age, people still make this drivel and why would they bother if they know they're not going to do a worthy job of it.
If the FX weren't so horribly bad (I assume they were made on a Commodore 64) it wouldn't be so horrible (the script still needs some work), but they are so amateur and dated that the film simply can't be taken seriously at all, making the performances seem ridiculously over acted, (the performances that is, not the 'actors' that turned up for one day of shooting to take their clothes off, stage some unconvincing scenes and swim in filthy lake).
If you want to see a good terrible movie, than watch other Made for Sci Fi movies like Crocidile and Crocidile 2...They are much better yet still terrible.
From the first scene to the last, this garbage proved that there are still Neanderthals out there in the movie making business.
", he thinks it's a joke and still doesn't appear to hear the croc that is about 3 feet from him!
It's kind of a Kramer vs. Kramer as the relationship develops with his child on one hand and his many sexual encounters continues unabated until his love and responsibility for his son override his desire to see still more women.
anyway I thought Dracula was known as a vampire but when i saw this movie it changed i don't know if this is the absolute true story but it was still a very good movie.
In Romanian folklore Vlad is celebrated as a national hero, and many still today pray for his return.
Seeing the way in which this film was done, it is no wonder that the Dark Prince is still a national hero in Romania, whose return is anxiously awaited.
I understood the movie lacked the necessary resources to stage the great battles that took place, but I was still hoping for a fair portray of Vlad and his environment.
And for you gentlemen, Ms. March is still no slouch herself.
That is why, for the Romanians, he's still, up to this day, considered a national hero of special importance, unlike any other, because his name is called upon in times of great oppression, when corruption and plundering of the national economy by the oligarchic political class bring the common, ordinary citizens on their knees.
The father and mother still pay homage to the 50's and cling to to the ideal of raising a home when it is obvious the kids are already grown and moving on.
"Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead" of 1994 was quite poor in comparison, but i was still entertained.
These two actors still deliver good performances as the Phantasm series' two memorable characters.
Willis O. Brien's special effects are still surprisingly good and way ahead of the 1960 version even if he was to perfect them further in King Kong (for which this film feels almost like a dress rehearsal at times), giving the film an epic scale in the volcanic eruption and stampede sequences, while Wallace Beery is a perfect choice for Professor Challenger, embodying the gruff, belligerent nature of the character to a tee.
The dinosaurs aren't as well integrated into the story as you might hope Â usually it's cutaways to herds of dinosaurs in their natural habitat Â and the racial stereotyping from Jules Cowles' blackface routine as 'Zambo' is painfully embarrassing and horribly unfunny (sample dialogue on seeing campfire smoke from the plateau: "That means our folks is still alive."
"This was the first screen adaptation of the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle story of prehistoric creatures still alive on a remote Amazon plateau.
An expedition is lead (sic) by Professor Challenger and consists of a newspaper reporter, a big-game hunter, and his servant as well as the daughter of the plateau's discoverer, who is still stranded in this uncharted land.
The story revolves around a group of adventurer-scientists who go on a mission to rescue a fellow scientist and prove that there are still dinosaurs living in the Amazon long after they are thought to have been extinct.
Which was about Dinosaurs & Prehistoric Creatures still alive in the upper reaches of the Amazon in South America.
His earlier Silent Movie Shorts when he first conceived the idea were corky & primitive but still entertaining today.
However it is still very enjoyable and worth viewing at the very least as a curiosity piece.
A group of explorers find themselves stranded on a plateau where prehistoric beasts still live, cut off from the rest of the planet's evolution.
This is still the best adaptation of Conan Doyle's gripping novel.
The first film of this genre to really attract attention is still one of the highlights.
Professor Challenger leads a party into an uncharted part of the Amazon where prehistoric monsters still live.
Hopefully, one day we'll be able to see "The Lost World" as it was intended to be, but meanwhile, we can still appreciate the enormous importance of its amazing special effects, and how it forecasts films like "Jurassic Park" in many ways.
"Oblivion" is right; further misadventures of Reggie and Mike pursuing the Tall Man still leave too much unexplained; we do find out the Tall Man's identity (Jebediah Morningside) and how he became interested in his "work", but it's never explained exactly how he got his supernatural powers, what exactly the "other side" is, what the flying spheres are or where they came from, how the "other side" transforms bodies into gnomes, and most of all, we still don't know what in the HELL the Tall Man means to do with his evil power.
I still think this is Gary Oldman's best performance of his career and Sean Penn and Ed Harris were very good as well.
The title of the movie explains it for anyone who doesn't understand the movie and if you still need clarification on what a state of grace is Penn's character explains it in detail in the movie when visiting Robin Wright Penn's characters apartment.
As I watched this one, I just kept picturing that he must have been a photographer, a still photographer at some point.
It is also a very telling story about religion and faith, and to my way of thinking still holds a relevance just as meaningful today as back in the later 40's and early 50's.
I must've seen it 20 times by now, and I still can't pass it up when it appears on some random cable station at 1 in the morning!
Just think of the staggering number of movies in any genre that are made every year for ten or twenty million, yet still are total garbage.
And it helps if childhood friendships still mean something to them.
Despite his jester charm, Al's Peter Pan persona irritates his frustrated wife Carla (the sexy Linda Fiorentino); Eliot's a homosexual who has no desire to play "the love game"; Dennis's still struggling on making it big in Los Angeles and Vin gets one-night stands but no romance.
Queens Logic is an excellently written film about a bunch of late thirty somethings who are still trying to figure out how to get their act together.
Although the cast itself was small and a couple instances of plot lines were a bit iffy, the movie still kept me in anticipation of what was coming next.
The Unknown combined the elements of romance, mystery, tragedy and suspense quite nicely to make a picture that would in my opinion still be worth watching even today.
Chaney gives his usual tour-de-force performance, Crawford shows the girl she still was, and the last sequence, involving an attempt by Chaney to murder Malabar in which two horses, rigged for a performance, run out of control as Crawford, is short, bloodless, but spellbinding.
The Tall Man can still deliver the looks that scare.
However, despite the different costumes, it's still a "Hercules" movie with the usual stilted dialog, haphazard dubbing, and cardboard characters.
It's dated, of course, but if you can leave that aside it's still good fun.
This is still a very good film exploring ethic conflict in India post-partition, but just does not have the strength and impact of Bombay (1995).
Kareena Kapoor though still very young, plays the role of a matured person and quite admirably.
This is one actor who still hasn't learned to act, and probably never will.
I consider Phantasm IV to be a little better than the disappointing (but still good) third entry of the series, but my issue with this one is that even though you are entertained throughout and your eyes will probably be glued to the screen, nothing really happens when you think about it.
Mike still sitting in the desert.
Okay, so the monsters look like badly fried eggs, and the scientific explanation of their arrival is pretty laughable, but still, you just can't beat the rural-island-in-peril formula!
I suppose it isn't too terrible though because his character wasn't of much relevance to the overall story, but still).
The conclusion to the movie is open-ended for a sequel (as are all the endings in these films), but we're still awaiting another installment to try and help answer a few questions and possibly bring a close to this utterly bizarre gem of a movie series.
Aids can kill, and still scares people away.
It's rare that the same creative team are still around 4 films into a series, and even rarer that a 4th film has anything new to add, so this makes a refreshing change.
It also goes some way to filling in the gaps, giving the Tall Man a proper origin story and answering a few questions while still leaving enough up in the air to justify the 5th film which is apparently in production currently.
There's still plenty of laughs, but there's a very downbeat tone and some nicely creepy touches, making this a very enjoyable, if slightly schizophrenic addition to a fun series.
While one may forgive Andy's naivetÃ© at thinking Kolkata is still the Baul music city of his dreams, his lecturing to people right & left about how to live comes off as annoyingly snobbish rather than an artist reaching out.
It's still my least favorite of the series, but I've realized that after all is said and done it's really not a bad film.
The two things that could have made this Looney Tunes episode be banned is the showing of Yosemite Sam being hanged (he does not die and the fact that there even was a hanging joke is creepier still) and the fact that prisoners picking at rocks had "banning potential".
The blond lead role chick looks like one of the dumb sluts from the "The Hills" show (whatever the hell that show is about, I still don't know, or care).
It's well photographed, and I liked when the guy beat one of the killers over the head with a wooden chair while he was still tied to it, and a couple of other scenes, but as soon as the movie would come to life, it would quickly fall back into a familiar predictable pattern of said earlier movies in the very next scene.
As usual, the poster was pretty cool, but I still didn't have my hopes set high.
I would love another journey with them, but, in my heart, I know that Reggie and Mike are still out there, traveling across endless dimensions, fighting the Tall Man for all eternity.
Twenty minutes could've been cut off this movie and possibly saved it; unfortunately, it can only afford to lose ten and still be considered a feature; however, that's ten viewers could have back so here's some suggestions for the DVD release.
Set in the southern English county of Sussex of the 1920s, and filmed there in the 1990s - and yes, there are still characters like the Starkadders out there!
But, Reggie still doesn't get laid and on his journey to help Mike he does encounter Jody.
I'm not saying that this film is perfect,the results of part 3's cliff hanger are disappointing, as are the ideas that Mike has about his 'abilities', but it is still a very enjoyable film.
I'm still trying to determine the words to the song that the parishioners sing before Amos's sermon.
Shows Rio de Janeiro when in a hypocrite society, who just ignored social problems like poverty, color distinction and others, that still existing.
As much as I like seeing the Tall Man, Reggie and Mike back in action, Jody still seems forced into the series.
The true identity of the Tall Man is finally revealed but the forces behind him are still kept in the dark.
The schoolteacher never could have foreseen the effect she would have on the butcher, but she is still responsible, and that is what is terrifying.
Like his desire for his mother still lurks in his unconscious, his desire for Helene is always present - and because Helene has rejected him, like his mother had done, Helene has created a relationship as close to his mother as possible.
In spite of their friendship, they do not become lovers since Helene is still recovering from the disillusion of her last relationship.
When Popaul visits her, she discovers that he still has the lighter and she feels relieved.
There's not that much in terms of sex or nudity, but it's still an entertaining film.
While predictable, there still was some charm and I liked the locker room fight scene with Pops.
However, although the script still looks good -- the corruption of an honest boxer -- there are far too many issues to make it enjoyable.
But it's Neil who's the real star: Sean, Roger, Pierce, Timmy, George - none of them can do the standing still bit as well as Neil.
You really can't blame the filmmakers, as the technology was new and they still had to work out a few kinks, but it does make the film seem pretty dated and creaky.
Mob boss Ayres is a supposedly smart man and retires from the mob when he's still very young and able to enjoy the spoils of his work.
Wanting to get Louie out of retirement and thus, with him back in charge, save what's still left of the organization two of his former colleagues the Midget and his partner in crime Gimpy try to kidnap little Jackie.
Though he drops a couple of notches in the screen credits from his first picture, "Sinners' Holiday", James Cagney still dazzles as a top mobster's second in command and hones the skills that will find him topping the bill for 1931's "The Public Enemy".
Well,not in my Dad's instance,because when my Dad saw the film on the Screen, it was shortly after Bogart's death and Cagney was already a long since established star.But still a treat nonetheless.
Though quite hardcore, they still are sexy, and even a bit humorous.
The jury is still out as far as nunsploitation and I are concerned; it's not that I don't appreciate sleaze in movies, just that the idea of a load of God-fearing women living behind convent walls doesn't really appeal to me all that much.
The only difference is that he used the Rockaways instead of Brooklyn because the appearance is still the same or at least in 1987 it was.
Woody Allen takes a look at the 1940s, when radio was still the dominant medium.
I've watched it at least 6 times and I still laugh.
The Radio days are gone but thanks to Allen, the voices of the times passed are still clear and sound and they always will be.
Wu Jing will be a face to watch out for in future action movies and it's good to see the old timers still going at it.
I'm glad they're still making old-style martial arts films.
Although this gets some heat for being sort of bland at times, it is still great to see Lar Kar Leung show us even as he ages he can still move around like he did 20 years ago.
I remember him from Eagles Claw (Tai Seng released this and is also a fun kung fu film), and even thirty years later the man is still ripped!
Gordon Liu and Chi Kuan-chun expertly add to mix in their respective good guy/bad guy roles and, despite being around 68 at the time, Lau Kar-leung can still wipe the floor with many of today's young pretenders.
Its great to see that Lau can still hold a kung fu fight sequence after around 40 years in the business.
The great thing about this film is that you will never get bored with it - I've watched it over 50 times now and it still doesn't let up.
Rarer still, is the film that has a prophetic nuance to it that touches the heart and drives home a powerful message.
If you don't get the reference, think about it... if you still don't get it, this movie's probably not for you anyway.
I must admit that the climax: fight between MD and other "super" man could have been much longer but still it is great finale!
I still believe that Bruce Willis is one of moviedom's most under-appreciated actors.
As far as martial arts films go this still has the best fight sequences outside of Hong Kong.
"Irritating", "annoying", and "aggravating" are the adjectives most often used to describe Mos Def's performance as Eddie in Richard Donner's latest film: a well-paced urban cop thriller which takes ordinary action-film clichÃ©s and raises them to about the pinnacle of their potential (while still remaining clichÃ©s).
It is still greatly entertaining, but has acquired the additional virtue of being a sort of history lesson.
No sound, the character is still, and really nothing obvious goes on in the frame, yet you still get the feeling that Mosely has: "holysh*t, I just shot that guy."
The director is still in the conviction that he can move his audience with these simple and obvious tricks.
Michael Caine's Jack Carter did wrong and he still had to pay for it.
I wasn't tired or stressed, I had just finished off a pot of Green Mountain coffee and I still managed to doze off for a minute or two during the movie.
With that being said the film still suffers it's drawbacks.
Mickey Rourke is good (starts out strong but gets a little two dimensional as the movie develops, but that's OK, he's still fascinating to watch).
So under McKenna's pen we go from a brutal crime flick about one man's darkness in the 1971 film to a crime flick still, but now Carter is the Angel of Justice or something and far less dimensional.
Because I love mobster movies, movies that take place in Vegas, and Stallone is one of my all time fav actors and him playing a hitman, in Vegas was a match made in heaven, but the film still sucked.
Had some good action scenes but it was all still a bore.
But hey, the acting is still much better than a lot of other crappy action movies.
Finally, I admire and still wonder about the ambiguous ending.
I had heard about this film and about how underrated it was,then last week i saw a copy of it on ebay on VHS PAL UK.I was really surprised as i didn't think it had ever been released in the UK.It must be one of the rarest videos in Britain as sadly not many people have heard of it.Luckily i won it for just over Â£3 not bad eh.So if any one else is interested in buying a copy,there must be others available in Britain,if you really look around.I couldn't wait to watch this film,and i must say i wasn't disappointed.Its starts off a mildly amusing story that suddenly gets sadder and sadder until it reaches a climax to a very tragic ending.I must admit the last 10 seconds of this film does bring tears to the eyes,i wont say why,but try and see this movie and you will see.The acting between Gary Cooper and Anna Sten is first rate,her character is very likable as she is totally unselfish,and is trying to please everyone,so she does deserve happiness.Garys character,well he is married and his wife is not a monster and she does love him,so you feel sorry for her as well,i think you have to decide for yourself in a triangle like this someone is always going to get hurt,but you don't know who.Also this is a very early film showing us cultural differences and the sort of conflicts that can arise when two people from very different back grounds want to be together.Can it work?he is from a literate sophisticated family,she is from a poor immigrant family that is still trying to learn new ways.The answer is if two people really love each other then they can over come their differences as true love conquers all,i think overall this was the strongest message that comes out of this film,to some people the married issue may be the point of the film.Any way this is a very haunting film and well worth watching if you get the chance.
Believe it, Houdini would be impressed by these two if he were still around.
It would still have a red light, but it would only go off when someone made a really good memorable action movie.
Only now the lodger has to be saved from the crowd who still think that he did it.
Still modern, still Hitchcock and certainly very interesting!
Yet even if I were to lump The Lodger in with its louder cousins and proceed to rate it purely on its relative entertainment value, this little gem of a film would still be rated as high as 8.
Although there is a happy ending shown in the film, still it is an open ending.
The story retraces the Ripper case, which by the time when the film was made was still present in the living memory of many London inhabitants.
This or some other ending would have made better a film which is still remarkable for its visual power.
Its a Silent film but as the voyeur you can still see everything that goes on you are looking through a crack in the floor of a second story apartment at a "Killer" Passing above your head waiting to strike,
Hitchcock's best work was still well ahead of him.
Hitchcock's presence is clear enough in still shots but the print I saw was so old and scratchy half the scene was obscured.
For one thing there is the influence of screenwriter Stannard and the fact that Hitchcock, although he may have relished the material, was still very young and inexperienced.
But it's still worth seeing.
After the success, or rather lack thereof, of "Curse of the Pink Panther", Blake Edwards realized he had to accept that Peter Sellers was no more and that he still needed to bring the name Clouseau back into the franchise, even if it meant giving Sellers' classic character an illegitimate son.
It was so funny i am still thinking of that line, "Hurry or they cut off my nipples!'
But let's look at it thoughtfully: If Sellers were in this movie, it is true it would still not be that funny, altho it would be somewhat better.
Dreyfus (still) is involved in the investigation at hand, of the kidnapping of Princess Yasmin of Lugash, played by Debrah Farentino.
It is good to see Cato (Burt Kwouk) still around.
And I think I will now play some deathmetal albums volume up to get rid of that nasty blabber echo still in my head.
As they flee in the streets and hide from people trying to kill them, they still have time to sit and babble endlessly, and always loud enough to ensure that anyone looking could find them.
I'm still hoping it will inspire a theatrical look at this legendary team.
At last, it has, and I'm buying a copy to see if it's still the barrel of black humor laughs I found it to be in '68 Brando was one of my favorites.
If you saw this film while you were high it still wouldn't be funny and would probably scare you instead.
I couldn't resist buying the collector's edition DVD of "Candy" but I still have to give it a 1 on the voting scale.
But regardless of that, it's still a really fascinating movie.
from Terry and Mason's novella rather haphazardly, the film is still one to recommend.
Candy is a total mess of a movie, but you should still watch it if only to say you've had the dubious pleasure of experiencing its unique brand of vulgarity, chaos and extravagance.
I'm still not sure how this film found it's way to my local Blockbuster.
I think if you still want to see it after hearing how bad the acting is, then it's your time and your money to wasted.
The actor played the character a little one dimensional, but since it is a comedy it still works.
In the end, Bruce's character is still his old tired self, except he now likes his birthday.
While this is not quite "Babe" level, it is still reminiscent of that same innocence and charm.
Angus still cares for his friend Crusoe.
Someone is still able to shoot truly remarkable movies.
When she made "The Last Dance," she was 82--and still a stunning woman.
I'm only have 3 years old when I see for first time this episode and let me tell you that this experience is still in my memory.
), subtlety is still the last thing one would hope to find in a De Mille pageant.
Consequently, it can still touch some of the 21 century viewers, particularly classic movie fans.
THE CRUSADES, however, is still entertaining in some way.
It's also a refreshingly mature approach to make Saladin an honourable foe, although there is of course still the obligatory moustachioed villain in the form of some anachronistic minor king (played by Joseph Schildkraut, naturally).
However, studios still don't have as much enthusiasm for these kinds of movies as fans such as I would like.
But it's still an interesting and ambitious effort, with a generous array of talent in front of and behind the camera.
Zhang knows when to move the camera, and he knows when to keep the damn thing still: it depends on what each scene calls for.
Zhang Yimou's attempt to squeeze yet another Chinese history lesson into one of his movies aside, I still came away unexpectedly moved by "Shanghai Triad."
The role of Jack Mosely may not be challenging to Willis, but he still gives it all he's got which is plenty.
He certainly did better, but it's still good for a few laughs.
I bought the DVD (had to order it because nobody carries it) and still find it pretty entertaining.
Drew Barrymore is so sweet and beautiful, and still remains my favourite female actress.
Wish I still lived in New York to be able to go see it.
It's still one of the greatest, albeit oft-played, films Adam Sandler has ever been in.
I've seen the movie at least 30 times by now and her expressions still make me cry, they're just so sincere.
The only thing that would make me offended by the show is if they made a parody of Hurricane Katrina, but I still wouldn't stop watching the show.
But despite the foulness of the skits, it still made me laugh out loud, which is obviously what it has done with many other people as the show has continued on for a total of 4 seasons so far.
Among such names was the late, great Michael Jackson, where he was supposedly showing up for court when an alien spaceship landed and the still coloured Michael Jackson jumped out proclaiming that he had been abducted by aliens in their mad bid to take over the world.
Take the first, second, and third seasons of Family Guy, which are well-scripted and still very funny.
The quality of animation in some bits is inspiring, and the breadth of what they are spoofing is amazing, you know your truly geek if you can figure out most of even the most esoteric (look up word if you don't know what it means, because it actually is ) references  Season 2   There are some gems in season two, however due to the fact that the DVD is uncensored, it makes it a bit more harsh, especially because most of the time we know what they're saying the overuse of the word douche seems to be without a doubt lack of a thesaurus in scripting, yes as immature as it can be, it's still kind of a funny word , but not used as a crutch the way most of the fart jokes come across, which there seem to be more in the second season than in the first, even though I don't think there really are in season two.
If you're too in love with your childhood, don't watch this show as this is not for children or people who wish they were still children.
One reason I enjoyed (and still enjoy) Robot Chicken is because it is so damn nostalgic, among other reasons.
My father never went off to war, but it still makes me think.
Nola she was so much different from many of the charters out there and I loved how her character development through out the story and how she actually learned something in the end.People creating movies think that if th guy is hot or the women is hot and a story is horrible the the movie will still do good and yes that is true but this one had all thing tied in it!
I decide to watch this one for two main reasons: first, it has a still young-looking James Mason, appearing in his thirtieth movie (he first appeared in 1935) and there's also one of the heavies of the thirties and forties, Herbert Lom, once again showing his under-rated acting ability.
But still I think it's the best movie I've ever seen.
Even if there were 998 people in England I would still call the nation England.
I am 16 and I am still watching these two cute movies.
Though my situation is the exact opposite of the girl in this movie (I'm Deaf child of Hearing parents) it was still very profound.
):   The whole plot was way to contrived and there was nothing frightening about it, though it was slightly creepy(But still didn't manage to fascinate.)
All the American flag waving of the Forties is still here in full force, but the patriotic propaganda of the Office of War Information (OWI) is interestingly mingled with a Hollywood "love your man" plot.
Our girls can stick it to the enemy while still standing by their men!
Even with all the romance our girls still occasionally find time to do some nursing, which usually consists of them sitting (and sometimes standing) around sighing and telling us and each other about how hard it is to be a nurse.
just sad to know that the whole cast has deceased...maybe lorna gray is still with us.
"So Proudly We Hail" was a timely film when it was made and 60+ years later its message is still relevant as an historical event.
Interesting for the fact that it was shot while the war was still raging ~ so there are a lot of decidedly non-PC references to "Japs" ~ but this is a real salute to the unsung women who served in "the big one."
It's long, yes, and occasionally strives to sound like a documentary, but it is never boring and one of its set-pieces, a patriotic speech made by the chaplain (Walter Abel), still resonates today, during another war.
Hollywood deserves a big hand of applause for making SO PROUDLY WE HAIL at a time when the U.S. was still involved in WW2 and our struggles to overcome the Japanese in the Pacific.
It's still pretty impressive, although some of the flag-waving gets a little heavy and the suds flow pretty freely when the nurses discover romance.
The fact that this movie was released while the war was still going on, is further testament to it's courageous stance in not candy coating the horrors of war.
The first time i ever saw this movie was probably in 1992 when this was still on the video shelves and as far as SciFi Horror goes, this is one of the very best there is.
Ah, the 80s, when Full Moon/Empire/Whatever movies still had a budget and were actually watchable.
"Shadowzone" is a surprisingly well-done horror film loaded with nudity and graphic violence.The acting is decent and the characters are well-developed.The climax is disappointing,though.The film is still worth checking out,if you like bloody monster flicks.My rating:7 out of 10.
The presentation is anything but flattering to the Communist Party and it is astounding the Wajda was able to get this made in a time when the Communists were still in power in Poland.
MAN OF MARBLE is a testament to those who had to live through the oppression of Communism, and also to those who are still living under its iron fist.
Unfortunately, a great performance of a boring character is still uninteresting.
Even though I defended it, I still feel the screenplay left something to be desired.
Meanwhile, Ben Gazarra, still suave after all these years, is romancing Uma's mom, Gina Rowlands.
A played-down, but still gritty and mostly honest look at how women 'survive' our male oriented, female knee-bending society.
Thurman's playing down of her looks still did not disguise the fact that she is a beautiful woman but that did not, for me, lessen the believability one bit.
granted there are even worse, cheaper and misguidedly serious movies than this ("hyper sonic", for example), this still pretty much redefines the term "a B-movie".
:( This would still work today if they would try it again.
I taped it off TV and still have the VHS copy.
Perhaps it didn't age well, but I still like watching it every now and then.
Sometimes it gets personal but their still professional.
This pilot establishes that Crockett is divorced from a woman he still loves, and how life as an undercover cop isn't exactly life-fulfilling.
Terminator: Salvation is still there, but was, for some strange reason, released to the public anyway.
I didn't have chance to see this show earlier so i'm watching it now 25 years later and it still doesn't seem old at all, it's even greater now as you look back at the mid 80's.
It never really get's really scary, that might be it ... Not the worst movie ever then (not close to that), but still not something you have to watch (unless you're a fan, as I said earlier)
I think there is still a lot of potential to explore.
X-Men was a really entertaining, and overall great film.Than again, I use great in lowest term, but still, I think it deserves to be called great.This movie is one of those superhero movies that delivered and stuck.Most just deliver and then you forget about them, but this one always has to be one of the first superhero films that comes to mind when you think of that genre.The casting could've have been more perfect either.I mean, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, and Halle Berry.All of them I've seen in numerous amounts of films and I think they're all fantastic.This is a good movie, and I recommend it for basically anyone.
all decisions a director makes have big impacts, and although I believe MC G will become a talented director, I think the amount of potential and the scale of a terminator film is too big for his abilities, he still hasn't learnt his own directing strengths and weaknesses, he isn't ready for film this big.
This poor direction to release too much and cut out too much story and replace it with action leaves you with still a good film, as the acting and script are pretty good.
Not as good as in Spider-Man but still very good.
All in all X-Men is definitely one of the better super hero movies out there and although it was surpassed by the sequel it still stands as a true testament to Singer's skill.
The new action-thriller, Terminator Salvation is not great, but if it proves one thing: an action film can be mindless and moodless and still be good.
Terminator 3 was terrible, yet a lot of people still liked it.
Yes, there are a lot of good sophisticated films, but when something as brainless and moodless as this comes around, I'm still able to enjoy it.
It was unusual to see folk come down with the disease while it was still classified as a 'mystery' and while docs were desperately searching for cures, reasons, symptoms etc.
Sarah has a physician friend Adrien (Michel Blanc, so memorable in his role in 'Monsieur Hire') who is gay, and while he is older, he still longs for the company of young men.
But the point is still a valid one, at least for the cross section of society, young and old, sophisticated and naÃ¯ve, creative and blocked, rich and poor, integrated into the ingenious and characteristically TÃ©chinÃ©-esquire story.
This movie tries to go against common belief in more than one way; you have the woman who doesn't have friends, but is still very happy, you have the woman who doesn't love her baby,... All these things aren't accepted by the public, but I think it's good to show that it can be different.
I loved Terminator one and two, I was disappointed in three but it still did not ruin the series.
It was actually remade Â and considerably improved upon Â by THE SHOOTING OF DAN McGOO (1945), a Droopy 'vehicle'; while remarkably similar in many respects to the later classic, one of my favorite Averys, it is a minor (if still highly enjoyable) effort Â for one thing, because of an anonymous i.e.
Even though I've seen many of Tex Avery's Warner Bros. cartoons and know what sorts of things to expect in them, "Dangerous Dan McFoo" was still a hoot.
5.Scen at marriage party gives a good glimpse of social interactions in Punjab also how feudal elements still hold sway.
This film is stripped of all the glitz and glamour yet still it manages to be a beautiful portrayal of the harsh reality of life.
I much appreciated the wedding scenes and the Mujra (yes, as intense as this film is, it still manages to chuck in a cute Mujra and a beautiful wedding) scene, they sort of prepare you for the depressing nature of what's to come.
Iron man on pure action left more to be desired and Dark knight is magnificent but still a little to grounded.
A class above the stereotypical Bollywood genre you would normally expect out of South Asia, this Pakistani film explores the origins of religious fundamentalism in Pakistan along with the horrors following Partition that still scar the memories of many in the region.
The film is subtle, and refreshingly free of hysteria, enough to make it one of the best films in the increasingly crowded Partition genre, and reminds us that the subject still has so much to explore.
The film is shot in stark, sharp tones, making it look like a comic book come to life more than any film I've ever seen, while still using real actors.
Here, he pulls out his gun and kills all the bad guys, while still having sex with Belluci.
Clive Owen has always been one of my favourite actors and while Mr Smith doesn't match up to some of his best performances, Children of Men's Theo, Chancer's Stephen Crane, etc, he still launches into the role with his trademark professionalism.
While at the times the stunts are too unbelievable, they still add to the fun and will keep you saying "No way!
Magnificent, in a word, not for the dude who is going to sit in the corner and say 'oh look how far fetched that is, look at all that CGI, this is so unrealistic', that is the brilliance of this film it is well and truly rip the crap out of the films which try to hide their CGI scenes with the good old chin wag, this film goes all out action, forget a good old nip to the toilets or a steady stroll to the popcorn stall unless you are still at a dated cinema which has intervals which always spoil the drift of the film because you are sure to miss a key action scene which all the guys you went to the movies with wouldn't stop talking about on the trip home.
The movie is still very fun to view and weighing in at only 90mins, it won't take up your whole afternoon.
I'll be sure to see it at least a couple more times while it is still in theaters.
But for the rest of us, who all have that 13 year old immature video gamer still inside, you gotta see it.
), it still feels fresh and original.
Monica Bellucci plays the most serious role in the film, and still takes to mocking her life and situation in this movie like the rest of them.
My favorite character would still have to be the sly Paul Giamatti, who is given some pretty crazy situations himself but they are coupled with the only lines of any intelligence (or longer than about four words).
The film takes the best cartoon elements, makes them flesh, and still kicks in that over the top craziness.
Well that is carried over here, these guys won't stop until their processor is dead, but since they're CGI for the most part it lessens the feel of real danger... Somewhere deep inside the Terminator fan in me was wishing to return to that dark skull covered gritty landscape we saw glimpses of in the first Terminator (this definitely isn't the future Connor's Mother warned him about)  Hardcore terminator fans might want to avoid this, it was better than T3 but still pretty far off the quality of the first two, still, if its a Summer Blockbuster you want then go see Terminator Salvation, you could do a lot worse...
"Wolf Lake" plays like an exciting mix of "Deliverance","Straw Dogs" and "Open Season".It's a tense and extremely well-acted survival thriller with some great scenes of violence.The shootout begins after the rape of Huffman's girlfriend.So if you are a fan of survival cinema you can't miss "Wolf Lake".It's a crying shame that such obscure Canadian movies are still unavailable on DVD.9 out of 10.
Overall, while this film does have some flaws; it's still an excellent thriller and it's very unfair that this is so little known!
Is there any one out there,who has information on this.Is the host of the show still alive.Where do i find more episodes of this wonderful show.Is there a DVD collection out there.Is there ever going to be,another series like this one.Since that show was on i have never gotten a feeling of just wanting more,and more out of a show.So i hope.That there will be a show like that in the near future.That could give the same feelings that this show did.
ABC, and One Step Beyond was an ABC program, was still an up and comer with out that many affiliate stations.
I found a few DVD's with some of the episodes (not this one though) and although they are kind of "hokey" by todays standards they are still entertaining.
I still like the psychic/psychotic connection Jaeckel has with the sharks, although I could definitely lose the hokey "shark medallion" sequence, which accomplished nothing.
The film does manage a true seventies exploitation style and while the film obviously shot on a very low budget, it still manages to be fairly good in that respect.
Depending on which line to which you subscribe, T4 still deviates vastly from BOTH sequels and begins a new alternative reality spin all its own.
It's still full of the same old rubbish and nothing has changed.
I'm shocked its still on TV after three or four years now.
They ignore it if at all possible and ask why are the people who are bringing it up still living in the past.
Unlike "Happiness" in which Solondz wallows in the depravity of social misfits, Winterbottom valiantly offers a redemptive glimpse of humankind, in which despite all adversity, there is still hope yet.
I was told at first that this was a typical woman's movie, but I -being male, 17 years old- was still interested to see it.
Second there is the character of the black guy who still lives with his mom.
I had a hard time believing this guy who was clearly infatuated with Nadia would still be living with his mother in such a timid way.
Wonderland will never break any box office records and is certainly not flawless, but it is an admirable film and it warms the cockles of this reviewer to see such worthy films still being made in Britain.  
Mainly, Inuyasha is a very good series up until the midway point, don't get me wrong, there are still several episodes that are good after episode 100 but later on in the series most of the characters you have come to love begin to have nothing to do except for stand on the sidelines while Inuyasha fights and they occasionally interfere.
I only got 2 watch the third one, but it was still really good!I really want everything i can find that is about InuYasha: movies, season DVD sets, toys, collectibles, and anything else i can find that's about InuYasha.I want 2 see the other movies really bad.
I still love the show, and watch it a lot.
The problem with kikyo is that she's a dead priestess who, in the past life, loved the half human/half demon and now wants him dead yet still claims she loves him.
First of all they spent the first hour of the movie acting like Marcus is a person just to have the major revelation that he is actually a machine - but wait, we already knew that from all of the trailers out there, so we just spend the first hour of the movie saying to ourselves "why are they still acting like he's human"????
By the end, only one friend and I were still watching and neither of us liked it.
The only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull (the band of seven).
Kagome and Inu-Yasha never fully fell in love ('cause he was still all in love with his 50 year old dead chick.)
She still managed to get Sesshmoaru some food but he declined.
I felt it did drag on a bit, but it was still entertaining.
Since this was a test screening, the sound was still a little rough and the time code had yet to be removed, both of which proved to be a bit distracting.
But all of the performances stood out, particularly Judd Nelson, who makes us completely forget about The Breakfast Club while reminding us that he can still act.
The PM also said they were still searching for a distribution deal, so I would like to wish Mr. Zambeck best of luck in his endeavors and would strongly recommend checking this out once it becomes available.
You'll still be disappointed.
I guess it was the second Huey helicopter crash with John Connor as both pilot and sole passenger that did it for me (it seems the U.S. army hasn't surplused any twin-engined Hueys yet, because Hollywood is still flying leftovers from "Apocalypse Now", even in the future).
I still fail to understand why "Carandiru" was ignored by inane Cannes film festival 2003 jury.Hector Babenco is a great filmmaker and I have still not seen "Pixote".This film provided me a great opportunity to comprehend his style.To my mind it is simply brilliant.When I saw this masterpiece at a cinema housing 1500 people,trust me when I say that I was not alone appreciating its greatness.There was absolute silence and the remaining 1499 people were glued to the movie screen.
'Carandiru', based on the memoirs of a prison doctor in Brazil, is a fairly conventional prison movie, telling us the criminals' stories (as told to their medic) of life both outside and inside the bars; but it's still an absorbing tale, with moments of humanity flashing through the holes in a very grim backdrop: the ending feels like overkill until you learn the sobering statistics of the real event on which it was based.
In my opinion, although slow, it was still fun to watch.
Brazil - for all its faults - is still my home and I love my country.
ItÂ´s obviously NOT an attempt to get only profit and maybe even an Oscar nomination, but still, it is an easy movie to watch.
Are they still in Kansas ?
It is a bit obvious but it's still a good movie.
And I still can't believe that it made it off of the script.
The human soul can survive the most unheard of cruelties and repression, yet still have the capability to hope and dream even the biggest dreams.
This young girl who has recently regained her voice, yet is still afraid to use her new found freedom, is our hero.
This movie will be very moving, if you can sit still and take the opportunity to be drawn into the disturbing situation of a destroyed Kabul after 25 years of war.
Most of us see the foot note of this 16th Century reference and try to concentrate on the rest of the play that still is strong and relevant to us.
The stars have aged somewhat, except perhaps Patrick Duffy who still looks almost as well as his days in "the man from Atlantis".
Delpy strikes a good balance of showing the positives and negatives of her home country and the U.S. -- for example, the French are a classy, exciting people, but cab drivers make openly racist jokes -- it's still a slightly backwards place.
Although is is clearly a B movie, I have seen it at least three times and recorded it once but have lost the tape and have many times wished I still had it on nights when TV viewing was exceptionally poor.
(Anyway, I still hunger to watch Scenes from a Marriage (1973, Ingmar Bergman))   There were two scenes almost break my heart.
I feel like the ending made a little flaw to the film, but it's still acceptable for me.
I saw it an hour ago and am still wondering why anybody would spend any money or effort making something as vacuous as this.
But even with the above all being true, this film could still have been saved.
The movie made me feel alive and realize that at my age of seventy-nine that I still have a lot spiritual growth ahead of me.
After the first couple of minutes (and arguments between Delpy and Goldberg, respectively) I was still skeptical.
The culture-clash story might have been done before, but this is still a very refreshing and most of the time utterly hilarious movie.
The characters might seem over the top at times, but they're still likable and real (as witnessed by the fact that the artwork in the gallery was actually made by Julie Delpy's father).
She has also aptly captured the emotions and dilemmas of 30-something adults who, under it all, are still looking for meaning, belonging and peace.
Though one might find it pretty easy to pick out where this movie is going, there are still surprises for those who think they have it figured out.
Of course, it is a bit graphic and over the edge, but at least it can do that while still holding the emotional appeal that makes it so great in the first place.
But meanwhile, they are still growing up in Kansas, and Neil gets his first real job as a hustler.
Brian Lackey (Corbet), a bookish, shortsighted teenager, is still troubled by the strange hole in his memories.
While this movie is still fresh in my mind, I want to commend Joseph Gorden-Levitt for taking on a role few actors would dare to touch.
Watching this movie as an 18-year-old girl, who still has a lot to learn about sex and the world that it creates, I took a lot from this film.
Then we have this film - which is what it is - still clinging ever so strongly to the vastly resource-depleted story of Carmilla, and lastly there is Twins of Evil which is nothing more than a Carmilla film in name only because of places and general themes and film trends.
Nothing wrong with that but we are asked to believe it opened up in the heart of Eastern Europe RIGHT BY the castle of a family known throughout the countryside as evil vampires(and still coming to life every so often as we are told through the opening sequence of the film).
Production values are still admirable for a later period Hammer title, and the decision to retain the period Gothic setting is admirable.
Not mysterious in a boring, unoriginal way, where the screenwriter screws you around with information; mysterious in the way that the characters are opening up in front of you, and yet they're still enigmas; their depths hidden in plain view.
I am still processing this powerful movie and the stunning reminder of the cost some of life's choices bring to our lives.
It is one that can be watched over and over again and still have the same effect.
The well-lit colour photography looks more natural than the jewel-like Gone with the wind colours of 1950s Jack Asher period, but it is still beautiful, and the Gothic sets and suitably melodramatic score are wonderful.
I have never forgotten it and am still feeling the slowly growing horror it produced back then when I remember it now.
In the mid-1970s, Hollywood considered homosexuality to be the dirty secret to end all dirty secrets, and films still generally presented gay characters as desperately unhappy at best.
I saw it for the first time when I was 15 in 1976 and I still love to watch it.
There is still the sense of the south, a slower pace, even today.
I watched this movie back in 1992 when I was 14 on midnight but I can still remember the scenes and plot vividly.
Unfortnetely, we are still struggling against anti-gay sentiment in the USA (read ex-gay ministries and conversion therapy).
We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go when it pertains to normal human sexuality.
He still managed to make movies (his big comeback was as the heart- breaking Johnny Nolan in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn") and he always remained likable.
I can still remember watching this movie on a Friday night on USA Network.
Either way Slaughter Studios has remained unused & empty ever since... Jump forward 20 years & aspiring low budget horror filmmaker Steve (Peter Stanovich) is going to break into Slaughter Studios & use the unused but still intact stages for his latest project.
I have since watched it and still find the humor.
I am married, with kids, a woman who had a career and gave it up for family and can still relate to the 'Mickey' character.
I already knew this going in but it still didn't help.
Watch this film as for all its flaws its still classic of its time.
I loved Grieg's music (well, still do) but this film really put my loyalty to the test.
You could say then, that this was a master plan ... but on the other hand, it still doesn't make it an entertaining view.
The setting is mostly quaint -- often opulent and petulant -- in outback, and somewhat eccentric, Australia still inside the first one hundred years of white settlement.
This film taught me that a gilded cage is still a cage.
I still have not been able to find a clip of this piece anywhere on the internet.
"So I Married an Axe Murderer", may not have been as great as "Austin Powers", or "Wayne's World", but I still loved it.
The problem is not that the movie is stupid, cheesy, and inane, but that that the movie realizes it is such and still continues to deliver the same old good versus evil confrontation - and guess who wins, and guess how it ends anyway.
As well as their many sequels and imitations that were soon to follow and are still with up even today.
Sure, the film doesn't have much in the way of a plot and the acting is generally weak, but its still a shocking and beautifully made experience.
An impressive film, that is still effective despite its age.
With all there is to love about this awesome flick, I still have to gripe a bit.
I am still not too sure what happened, but the twist only halfway works.
her friends met a grisly death, with two of them dispatched at once in bed, with the guy on top still pumping away as he is dying.
Despite some dodgy camera-work (rapid zooms and shots thrown in and out of focus), a few plodding moments and some dated looking scenes involving 'groovy' teenagers, Mario Bava's A Bay of Blood is still an entertaining slasher/giallo movie, made even more notable by the fact that it heavily influenced Sean S. Cunningham's 80s classic, Friday the 13th, made almost a decade later.
Mario Bava's eye for detail doesn't wane with this film, as despite being a grisly slasher; there's still more than enough time for beautiful scene setting.
The idea behind it is original and it's still a one-of-a-kind flick, even if the movie itself inspired a gazillion slashers.
This independent gem tells the story of a girl who setup a threesome with her ex to show him she's still the best.
You see, I was pointed in the direction of this movie a couple years ago, while the filming was still going on.
- Kevin Smith, Director Clerks, Dogma  K&C feels a lot like Clerks, but is still fresh enough to enjoy.
The cinematography "felt" a little "indie"- as in not shot by an ASC member, but still felt solid.
As something of an indie film-maker myself, it's exciting to see a film like Kisses and Caroms, because it manages to use it's indie status to it's advantage - free of studio interference, Vince Rocca has crafted an outrageously funny film which could never have come out of Hollywood, whilst still not falling into the traditional pitfalls and clichÃ©s of independent film.
Does this still happen today ?
The story was one of those that is predictable, but still interesting to see how they explain where the characters are going to end up.
The whole idea of Indians still living in the U.S. as they did 130 years ago is fascinating.
that something we thought was gone is still here just over that next mountainside.
A place where time stands still and where life, and the environment, isn't corrupted.
I'm still unclear on whether the sheriff was one of the seven mummies, whether he wanted the gold for himself or to protect it, or why he was after the amulet at all.
I've never liked cowboy or Indian pictures, but this movie realisticly sets up a fantastic but simple premise that there are Indians still living in the wilderness.
The performances are wonderful,The script sparkles and the story still enthralls.
Nevertheless, he is still captivating as a giggling, psychopathic, sleazy town sheriff and supernatural 'mummy'.
I was delighted to find out that the film is still a grand piece of soapdish entertainment, and if you have yet to delved into Hollywood's early classic period of film-making, this MGM production provides a nice starting point.
She swoops her chiffon sleeves and looks meltingly romantic in close-ups, as if she were still in a silent movie, but then speaks extremely flowery dialogue.
At moments there is nothing much happening on screen but due to its characters the movie still remains interesting throughout its entire running time.
But it is the stars as a group glowing brighter than ever in a time to quote Norma Desmond when pictures were still big, the players larger than life.
Grand Hotel still holds up today with its story line and performances but it is also an excellent example of a period that was about to come to an end (1932).
As it stands I can only give it an 8--but it's still well worth seeing.
i was left with lots of questions after this movie, but i still enjoyed watching it.
In 1932, the United States was still in the midst of the Great Depression, but Hollywood was optimistic.
Third-billed, and even with added Garbo scenes to keep Crawford from walking off with "Grand Hotel," she still does.
In "Bill of Divorcement," with Katherine Hepburn, in this same year, he still wears more eye shadow than she, and is still given to the odd sing-song stage (as opposed to film) line reading.
Edmund Goulding's Grand Hotel is a perfect example of how a flawed film can still be great because of its blemishes, and not in spite of them.
What was a great movie in 1932 is still a good movie in 1999.
I still like this film.
Preysling is aware of his feet of clay but he is still known as a big textile manufacturer to the public.
One explanation could be that this was still a really early stage of the talking picture, and silent films solely relied on gestures and facial expressions to convey emotion.
End of minor spoiler  Yes, Grand Hotel still remains splendid entertainment!
The movies have begun "talking" not long before this film was made and the stars of those silents were still doing their acting in front of the camera as though no one was going to hear them talk.
Her way of acting is still imbued with what was expected of her.
All the time I got the sensation he knew the character of Kringelein, a man who has been pushed around by Preysling and is still not quite free of his micromanaging shadow.
When John Barrymore enters her life he's like the audience she entertained over the years rolled up in one person who still cares about her the individual.
Instead, the film has a lot of random scenes that don't make much sense and even when the finale comes, still does not make any sense.
Its a real shame that egyptian cinema's still produce such rubbish until now.
HOWEVER (of course, there has to be a "however"), this still doesn't mean that Jason is dead - the evil force that has animated Jason all these years is still very much alive and free to inhabit a succession of victims.
I will still watch and hopefully enjoy "Jason X".
Jason Goes to Hell is a sequel that brings something new to the franchise by having Jason destroyed at the beginning but he still lives through his heart and after making a coroner eat it he posses him and continues killing people until he finds a new host to put his heart in.
i do still watch it for the blood and laughs.
then the wind starts to blow the dust, and you see that his mask is still there...and freddy kruger's claw bursts through the ground and pulls away the mask while laughing.
Maybe I'm being a touch harsh on it as I've seen far worse but I'm fed up of wasting my time with crap like this, having said that I'll still be stupid enough to be the first in the queue when the next low budget piece of crap gets released.
But still, there's as much blood and terror represented in this film as there is in all the other ( to say the least, in fact ) According to a bountyhunter ( who is a pretty good maniac himself ), Jason can be killed for good if a relative of his destroys his heart.
If you're a horror lover in general, you can still enjoy the huge amount of bloody slaughters without paying much attention to the storyline.
We were lied to and for that I am still mad to this day.
Not actually killed in Manhattan (surprise, surprise), Jason is still at it until an undercover FBI agent (Julie Michaels, who makes time to take a shower) tricks him into an ambush where he's blown to pieces.
The concept that even at this age, people can still maintain, grow and explore all forms of sensuality and sexuality is very appealing - kind of makes me feel that there is sex after 50!
Also, you only had to sit still for 90 minutes instead of 4 hours.
Though still fun to watch, these later films are better and more enjoyable.
I happen to be in the history business, in a way, and was surprised at how good this still was.
See it if you can stomach it - I still have flashbacks.
I'm still trying to figure out where the title "7 Mummies" comes from.
But you can tell western electric was still playing around with sound trying to get the levels right.
She's still a Goddess however.
It's as if the writer of the 1st half let his little nephew still in Junior High School finish the script.
While not the worst recent Urban horror movie, there's still nothing worth recommending here.
I'm not sure if I've seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it.
I definetly recommend this to anyone (you can buy it on DVD or VHS) even if your not a Sinatra fan, you'll still love it 10/10
While a previous reviewer has aptly pointed out, the make-up is amateurish, the details of Cagney's life are left out(especially with reference to his son, Creighton) this is still a good film which manifests the life of a struggling actor, and there is an amusing cameo with a young Robert Evans as Irving Thalberg, studio genius.
I still felt the producers used enough actual events in Mr. Chaney's life to convey to the viewers what a truly talented man he was.
The doctors were afraid the boy was still born,Chaney took his Axe and rushed Lon Jr to the lake,cut a hole in the winter ice and dunked him under.
Although the acting is undeniably Cagney it still shows a range not possible in his hoodlum roles.
Occasionally the film editing and/or writing jumps too quickly across too many years, but it is still able to be followed.
He still can't recover from his previous relationship and suffers from anxiety attacks.
Hollywood 'realism' has never been more obvious or watered down than here, yet the film still manages to give off a quaint charm and appeal that makes it bearable today.
He is chasing after a woman he belives he still loves.
He has reached his peak, and while still near the top, he has become a headache and problem to his studio because of his drinking the past several years.
I couldn't help but think of the adulation so many still heap on the movie stars and celebrities of today.
Binoche's beautician is also far more interesting, and less stereotypified, than American film portrayals (Fran Drescher, Dolly Parton, Jennifer Coolidge...)  Not one of the great French films by any means, but I still give this one 8/10.
"Snapphanar" barely aims for the tree-line it seems, and still it disappoints.
They are portrayed like a bunch of stumbling do-gooders completely without fighting skill, making it very clear why SkÃ¥ne is still Swedish today.
Their spirits still walk among those roads and those who dare step out onto the road shall meet with these wrath of these long-dead criminals.
It has its faults and some of the effects aren't up to par with the 21st century exactly, but it's still worth a look.
If you're still interested in watching it then may I recommend full-frontal lobotomy?
Better still, we've got nice cameos by venerable character actors L.Q.
it explodes, leaving his smoldering (and still standing!)
Personally I still wish for more.
I still found the jokes, the kids and the faculty hilariously funny.
Even without mystery science theater this one would still be full of laughs.
Of course, they still live in the Dark Ages Â wearing togas and the like Â and regularly sacrifice 'obsolete' members in their midst by frying them to death.
It is very camp but it is still one of my favorites.
However, I still should point out the script problems.
But it's still terrific and two thumbs up.
"Mountain Patrol: Kekexili" is Chinese director Lu Chuan's second feature, set in the gorgeous titular Tibetan plateau where Tibetan antelopes were and are still being poached and mercilessly shot with their numbers dwindling from about a million to around 10,000 in the 1990s.
While I know I am biased and I will explain why, I still feel I should write and try and express the depth of feeling I have for this film.
If what I have written here still doesn't move you to see this film then see the film as see for yourself you will not be disappointed.
The visitors in this movie aren't quite the sadistic neo-vivisectionists of Fire in the Sky, but they are still unsettling.
Flip is somewhere in his mid to late 20s and still lives with his parents, and as to how he wasn't thrown out by now is a mystery to me.
This is ultimately the moral of the story, but it still comes off as incredibly trite and has a "TV movie of the week" feel to it.
Except he still dresses the same and talks in a stupid accent.
A man died and he was nearly beaten to death and he still hasn't learned his lesson, and to top it all off he now has a hallucination sequence in a cornfield when he returns home.
Or is he still jobless in Iowa?
I loved the Slick Rick, Doug E. Fresh cameos and am still wondering how they got Snoop Dogg to agree to show up in this cameo.
The color photography is, although maybe a tad washed out now, still striking in its use of shadows.
With all the realness of this movie it is still funny as heck.
With all the realness of this movie it is still funny as heck.
One of them asked if Elizabeth was still Queen of England.
Regardless, it still gave me one of the best laughs I've had in a while.
Oke.. if you are still with me, pause and reread the above sentence.
A mixture of his moral tales with his comedies and proverb series, it is the lesser of each but sub-par Rohmer is still superior to most filmmakers.
Overall his character appears kind of twisted... a cold avenger who uses what he learned in military and takes harsh and precise planned revenge (the "drug party" is some pretty heavy stuff although it doesn't use any gory shockers)... yet he seems deeply hurt and vulnerable which in the end turns out to be true and still the worst revenge on one of the thugs.
I am still in love with him!!
Let me conclude by saying that despite all my points of criticism I still think that this version in its overall great faithfulness to the novel is miles above nearly all other Jane Eyre adaptation, and I would invite all true lovers of the novel Â and using that term I exclude all those who earnestly affirm that the silly 2006 perversion of Jane Eyre is true to the novel or to the spirit of the novel Â to watch both the productions of '73 and '83 and to form their own opinion.
Why, oh why, has it still not been released on video?
It is testimony to the power of those wonderful performances of more than 30 years ago that I can still remember how superb they were.
The forty years old Gina Gershon is still a very sexy woman and is another attraction in this above-average film.
She wanted her kids, she was still the one to take it all in her ex's will, and that she wanted him out of her and her kid's lives.
Simpson in front of a sex-starved black female jury - yet she still has doubts.
Despite its genre clichÃ©s, this is still a rather well made movie.
Hearing this,Sally comes to the realization that she is Geoffrey's next victim of a well-planned crime.Stanwyck has never been better as a panic-stricken wife,trying to survive her husband's evil doings.Bogart gives a highly underrated performance as a psychopath,who gets brutal when his murder plot doesn't go according to plan.His presence on screen is often frightening.The ending is wonderfully witty and comical.While not in the same league as "The Maltese Falcon"or "Key Largo",this is still a highly entertaining Bogart film,that will not disappoint.
However, it is still funny to see how they dramatize things.
The episode is full of "300" style special effects, and is still remains hilarious.
If you are a J.T.T you will like this and if your not it is still a good movie!
While the narrator does give an impression of her own view, it isn't to the point that disallows the viewer to still disagree easily; and that's a nice thing to have.
I think everyone should give this movie a chance, but I still can't see how people don't love it.
Now who can really argue with a movie that manages to work in Ed Wood without totally Screwing itself and while still being good?
When I went to the theater to see screwed I knew it would be a good film, with Dave Chappelle and Danny Devito, I also knew that since Norms previous feature film (Dirty Work) was hilarious and very well-written that this movie could not live up to it, and it doesn't but it is still a wonderful piece of work.
Not entirely unpredictable story BUT still a good story.
I remember this movie as a young child.Pamela Ferdin and Ray Miland were great in it.It was actually kind of creepy and depressing about a young girl who had died.It actually upset me as a little kid that the characters daughter died so young.I never knew kids could die and this freaked me out as a kid.In some ways I guess it made me realize that anyone can die young and old,but the ending was hopeful and made me feel a bit less freaked out.The musical score was very well done and the acting was good also.TV movies in the late 60's and 70's,80's were SO much better than they are today.They actually had a STORY and Characters that were more realistic and original.Today,writers have no talent as they need to RE DO like every movie in a remake.Sad.I like the Originals.Wow,now that I think about it,I must have seen this in the 70's as I am still in my late 30's and this was made in 1969,the year I was born.I probably saw it at age 11 or 12 sometime in the mid to late 70's on a rerun.It really scared me.
Though not Laura any longer, the blue eyes are still beautiful and vibrant, her smile is still lovely, and though illness has taken its toll, she is still beautiful.
"A Day without a Mexican" may not be subtle in its approach, and probably it forces its message a bit too much, but still raises very important points and delivers its message without problems.
The Arau couple had a brilliant idea and raised very good points, however, the film still feels as if it could had been better.
If the film is also very slow and dramatic, the slowness of the film goes on so much that one wonders "is this still the film?"
Even though there is still a lot of racism out there, they showed most white people as racists whom are helpless without an illegal immigrant doing cheap labor.
One last thing that i strongly disagree with this movie is that what if there are not Mexicans around there is still a whole bunch of Central-Americans and South-Americans who are always classified as Mexicans.
If you eliminate the illegal immigrant Mexican you still will have a lot of illegal immigrants of different places of this planet that will do that cheap labor work.
And after the credits roll, I found it to be a film that stayed with me for some time after - indeed, I am still trying to shake it from my mind.
The only good part was how the movie showed that if millions of people disappeared all at once, those jerks in the little toy carts would still be driving around putting parking tickets on the windshields of the mysteriously disappeared.
The only editions of Giallo that are still around are like from the early eighties, and it is logicall that by now they are worn out, and at least the one I watched has editing errors that look more like they were made at the time of preparing the video edition.
So inept are the characters that even with full motor control and verbal abilities, they still seem more dysfunctional than poor crippled Patrick.
Mario Landi's PATRICK STILL LIVES is a weird little film that is weak on pretty much every level - but still manages to be entertaining and pretty fun to watch...  Patrick is the victim of an unfortunate (and kinda hilarious...)accident: while standing by the side of the road, he's randomly hit in the face with a bottle that a passing motorist chucks out of his window, leaving poor Patrick in a coma, but with telekinetic powers (!!??!!)
Regardless, or possibly because of these things, I still got a kick out of this one.
He says he still doesn't know what he's going to do with the year ahead - a remark that mystifies Pete.
Predictably, he has no luck; she bypasses him in favour of Jerry, possibly because he's not as stoned and can still string a few sentences together.
Even so, I'm still hankering after East.
It's been twelve hours since the closing credits rolled and I am still processing my experience of Dead Man's Shoes.
I now own the movie on Paramount DVD and it is still awesome not that it should be in the top 200 but a maximum of 7.1.
A disappointing conclusion, but still all-round good entertainment
But the best thing about it is the huge cast of comedy allstars (some of whom were still relatively unknown at the time) that make appearances.
I'm still both haunted and mesmerised by that long black & white sequence leading to Anthony's death and Richard's lonely face at the bus stop, quietly grieving for his little brother.
Adam Sandler is on screen for 2 minutes and I am still chuckling at his quirky sleaze-ball office geek.
I see pics of her on IMDb and she looks OK now, back in 93 she probably still looked cool, I mean why not use her as the kid?
This falls back to a time when crude and rude was still in its infancy.
Light for the day, it is still lots of fun.
I am still blown away.
This movie also revealed to me the fact that if you have snow camo on in the spring, a motorcycle helmet with black tape over the face mask, and a nail gun with a bright yellow air hose, you can still sneak through the woods.
After a good twenty minutes, half of the redneck population is already dead, while the local doctor and dumb sheriff are still cleaning up the blood of the first victim.
One of the most memorable scenes occurs in this film when a girl gets killed and the killer is gloating about it, unfortunately the girl is still very visibly breathing, blinking her eyes and looking around everywhere.
I think it fair to say that someone who objected to many aspects of the DDR regime but still wished to hold on to his influence with the leaders would necessarily walk a dangerous tightrope; and it is no easy matter to judge whether Brecht would have served the cause of humane socialism better had he spoken out more forcefully against Ulbrecht's regime (though, obviously, that would make for better cinema).
she had the accent down, but still - aren't there talented actors from America?
still, she extracts competent performances with those restrictions.
SHAME on fascist people who still thrive freely !!!
I still can't believe that it was a director's first film.
The only regret I had watching "Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey" was that Bruce, the master of all masters, wasn't still alive to see what great tribute is being paid to him with this documentary.
Fortunately, there's still some decent laughs after that.
When a cheating gambler is fatally shot, grim-faced saloon proprietor Buster coolly disposes of his body through a convenient trap-door, and this still works as a jab at actual Westerns where violent death is treated as routinely as the ringing of the phone.
Though I missed the Romberg/Donnelly score, I still enjoyed the performances of Ramon Novarro and Norma Shearer and the rest of the cast being transported back to Old Heidelberg under the masterful direction of Ernest Lubitsch.
( black and white horrors ).If anyone can help me out it would be appreciated.I will pay money and costs of shipping or exchange for some items from Australia ie White pointers (Shark) tooth pendant.On vhs tape can be either ntsc or pal recordings.Just remember you can never replace the memories or scared feelings that these old hammer horrors gave us when we were young and impressionable.I gave this a 10 rating cos it was the first horror film i saw and the fond memories of how scared i was are still with me to this day 30 years later.
In 1988 (the release year) a large number of people all over the world still had great fears of a nuclear war and the subsequent end of the world.
At that time, I barely knew who the Twins were (I still haven't seen the Twins Effect, and I don't think I ever will), so that only made the whole thing more surreal.
The sound track is typical Eighties (Tangerine Dream), strange today but it still creates a excellent atmosphere.
The 2003 DVD release is sadly a retread of the much earlier full-screen laserdisc release, but still very watchable.
While the movie is extraordinarily captivating overall, I think a few scenes in the beginning have a somewhat cheesy 80s feeling to them, but they're still strangely hypnotic.
Ok,I'll have to admit that it's dated now (look at the clothes...)but that same sad feeling that creeps slowly into your head while watching this movie is still there!
Now, years later, I've just rewatched it (this time on DVD) and I still think it's a very good -- but not great -- movie.
One positive note: the film uses a cute technique of animating still photos, but even that novelty wore off after about 5 minutes of it.
THE GIFT OF LOVE has got to be one of the most cringe-inducing movies I've seen from the '50s when sentimental tear-jerkers were still the rage, especially if they were dressed up in handsome Technicolor photography and settings...and preferably, with stars like ROBERT STACK and LAUREN BACALL for box-office appeal.
It's still banal, all the way, with a ludicrous script and inept performances you've got to see to believe how bad the acting is.
The film has great charm which is enhanced by the incredible animation of characters in old still photos, as well as some wonderful, delightfully original animation.
It does this very well with still pictures, animations and interviews with people who remember the past.
(This during a time when Chinese were still treated poorly by most cultures and by officially repressed by immigration laws worldwide.)
This movie is not appropriate for kids(23 and under), I still have nightmares and must visit a shrink to keep me calm.
We must learn to love our freedom while we still have it.
I still enjoyed the first half of the film up until they leave the leper but after that the pace gets strangely confusing.
Although his story is based on fact and has tried to bring some more gritty reality to the story, it is still a Hollywood formula film where the looking for respect "actor" but really movie star McQueen is paired with the a new wave (for the time) respectable actor but really movie star wannabe Dustin Hoffman to give it commercial appeal.
Homosexuality, nudity, loads of blood and gore, elements which today STILL have it hard and are somewhat still regarded as tabu.
Dustin Hoffman is better but is still more of an "along for the ride" character, not his greater work.
This is all especially remarkable in that Hollywood movies at the time were still rife with abysmal gay stereotypes (see "Play Misty for Me," "The Eiger Sanction," "The Producers," any number of others in all kinds of genres.)
So, provided you understand that this isn't quite a true story, this is still an exceptional film.
As it turns out, they do become close eventually for tragic reasons - the scenes of Evelyn Rudie running close to the cliffs near the beach by their home still haunt me.
Well even though some of these sorority girls *are* big snobs, more concerned with how much money a girl's family has than her character - our Alice still HOPES she will be invited to join one of these sororities.
I still remember this movie through the eyes of a 12 year old girl and while I may not be a good critic of quality acting & scripts, I do know that this movie has haunted me since I was 12.
Ending is a TINY BIT of a copout, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless.
Even if you gave Steven Speilberg the directing job and Brian Grazer produce it would still be a sucker.
One scene in the movie was Lauren reflecting on her situation, looking out an upstairs window onto the garden -- I can still picture it after all these years.
Not only is it a struggle to find what could even be considered laugh lines, but Lehr ensures there's nothing funny about his basic character (unlike a show like The Office, for example, where Steve Carrel could stand motionless and still be hilarious).
Despite not having any experience as a comedian, you would still be infinitesimally more humorous than "10 Items or Less", TBS's new attempt at killing laughter throughout the known world.
Let's take a look at that sentenceÂ You can replace the word "supermarket" with any other place of business and you will still have the exact same show.
I guess it's still better than the endless stream of my husband is a monster because he only takes me out once a week and even had two beers last Christmas-flicks but man is it close.
But still, this movie has been done before.
I honestly don't think she would have cared about her mom being fat if there was still money for her to get an education.
In the end she still doesn't understand WHY people overeat, or the emotional pain of actually being fat and overeating and she still continues to judge fat people harshly for eating bad foods.
Right...well Ali (based on a "true" Story) is a bit of a Fat Phobic (just like almost in one in America who's never felt the pain of being fat)..thinking it all about your attitude..and when she loses her sports scholarship..she decides to enter a student film competition for the prize money for school.....and her idea is to prove being unhappy and fat is all out the fat person's negative attitude....if only people like her little brother(overweight) had a positive attitude their lives would be better..thats why she's popular (not because she's a pretty blonde jock)..the commercials leading up to this promised a true look/insight into one area of life where bigotry and prejudice are allowed to reign supreme... i "thought" finally people see something about the cost of our obsession with weight...how thou bashing of gay and others may be illegal...but fat bashing is More than OK....But the promise of the commercials was NEVER delivered...even although Ali don's the "Fat suit" for at least a month...at the end of it..she's still very hateful over her mom's past weight (its treated like a very dirty little secret)..never asking why people over eat...or even some the different causes people gain weight, her partner on the film has a hard attitude towards the world in general and never stops calling the one "fat" girl and meets and befriends.."her Fat friend"...after a month spent on this Ali changes only a little..after lying to everyone very little is said after ward...you keep waiting/hoping for her "a Ha!
even though the film focuses more on the italian businessman, the struggle for survival that most Albanians had to go and still have to is quite clear.
I hardly think anything about this show could be described as 'genius...'  Having said all that, I have still been sucked into this show!
Bill Murrey was the original choice for the role of Bernard Berkman, yet Jeff Daniels still manages to play the role perfectly with highly comedic one liners.
Not that all tensions need to be resolved, but there were still a few open plot points at the end.
Unfortunately, while keeping the length of the film to a minimum and editing out all but the most important details keeps the film from being excruciating, it is still terribly slow.
In fact they both swear at their parents which, again quite commnon, still doesn't help keep a family together.
Frank is still a kid but he has begun masturbating in elementary school and wiping the residue on selected girls' lockers.
A light bulb goes off in the heads of the audience but the school counselor still looks a little clueless.
But still, it was far harsher then anything he uttered before or after.
He has a keen touch with his actors Â especially Daniels, the centerpiece character, who is brilliantly funny, touching and head-shaking misanthropic at the absurdity of his situation (at one point he says glibly with a touch of melancholy, "that's my home which I used to live inÂas you may know", to his son during one of their jaunts back and forth) that has echoes of his first fine role as Flap, the philandering English professor husband of the doomed Debra Winger in "Terms of Endearment", suggesting a bookend to what Flap may have become ultimately (and I'm damned if I'm not right at one point Walt is looking at his father's novel's backflap and the photo suggests a still from that film!).
Every member of the family is brilliantly brought to life and even though they are acting in their own flawed, selfish, self-annihilating and myopic ways, they still endear themselves to the audience like they are our own family.
Her new found success as a writer sets her off on a trail of confidence and joy, all the while understanding that her family still needs her very much.
Other outstanding performances include William Baldwin (the one from "Backdraft"), Holly Feifer (as Eisenberg's first girlfriend) and Anna Paquin (underused, but still very effective).
Her character has to take responsibility for her infidelity but still make the audience sympathize with her.
And then after a long and sleepy hour, at last some werewolves appear (hello are you still awake, it took me a lot of coffee to achieve that) and then there is some action.
It's still a good film.
Even if this was a made for TV movie it would still be one of the worst ever made.
Worse still, the only scene that showed any potential for genuine sleazeÂa pair of randy teenagers making a home made porn video discover that Griffin is in their roomÂis suddenly dropped without any kind of resolution.
Anyway, I first saw the movie with a friend years back and whenever we get together we still can't help throwing out a "who's idea was the corn?
Lauren is now the only child still living at home.
I still felt the film was relevant even watching the video 35 years after I first saw the movie in a theater.
But at the end of the day it's still just okay and not good enough to warrant a good review.
This movie is VERY loud (basically because Streisand yells nonstop), the humor is pretty caustic (Streisand thinks Segal is gay and throws quite a few homophobic jokes at him) and is pretty risquÃ©--it was edited from an R rating but there's still plenty of swearing and sexual sequences.
Although their catalog is still quite small, NoShame easily gets my vote for the best DVD production company of 2005.
I still can't keep a straight face when imagining him trying to say "as-tro-phy-si-cist."
I think I've seen some or most of Farley's films and I still haven't even settled on a favorite (most and least) yet.
The movie is still funny and still like I said in my comments.
Coco still pines for the hunky abortion doctor that operated on her many years ago.
Perhaps it all was archive footage as well, but I don't think so judging by the diving suits the hunters wore, and even if it's all fake it still remains poor padding.
That being said, this film is more like a trashy and exploitative soap opera than a Jaws rip-off, but even so; the runtime is still far too long.
It's only in the last half-hour (of this 126-minute picture) that the chase is well and truly on Â after the shark attacks and kills one of the two men; still, this doesn't take the other's mind off sex Â resulting in perhaps the film's highlight as a group of revelers is attacked at night, with the girl (one of two American sisters vacationing in Mexico) accompanying the hero ending up killed.
For the record, I recently watched the even more popular (if still essentially dismal) horror/wrestling hybrid NIGHT OF THE BLOODY APES (1969) from this director's father and for which they both contributed to the screenplay.
Surprisingly enough he was still great in this flop but he was the only one.
And yet I still bawl like a baby every time I see it.
It leaves Southern white people with still another defeat that they must get over.
The KKK set a church for black people on fire to scare the black people into not talking to the FBI, when Ward and Anderson walk into a restaurant and try talking to a black person he says: ''I have nothing to say to you'' but still the townspeople beat him up for talking to people from the FBI.
The FBI agents search trough the endless swamps and find the car of the civil rights workers, but they still find no bodies.
Gene plays very dominant and the scene in the bar where he threatens the townspeople is one of the best moments in the movie, because you don't expect it from him but still it fits him very well.
I still laugh the most at the eagle scenes.
But I know they exist, because I know some of them...a few who are still living.
Mostly it is their children I know, who still feel the same way about Blacks, and still do the same encouraging of White trash.
I would say that Karam has got a good story, good acting and screenplay, but still this movie did not do much business ... sad to hear that... Indian audience ... wake up plzzzzz....
Sanjay F. Gupta made a terrific film for his first attempt he only made one film so far but still he is one of my favourite directors.
The suicide element is so brief and tame, that this could still easily be rated G (remember, G doesn't have to mean kids, it just means General Audiences).
The film is about two persons who become connected through death and how it in the end fulfills both of their wants and dreams that they couldn't have while they were still alive.
is a fairly unknown, but amazing and amusing little thriller from the late 1960s that still holds up very well to this day.
I was pleasantly surprised with how great this film was, and how it still, nearly forty years later, holds up well and is just as effective.
Oddly, I still remember it quite well; it is one movie no one would be liable to forget, if only for the deranged character of Mrs. Marrable, and the pesky Aunt Alice, who is out to uncover the murky truth about her mistress.
It still creeps me out to this day.
After seeing this film twice in two days, I am still stunned at the magnificent performance given by Geraldine Page.
although there is one thing that i still don't understand very well.
A very interesting movie still!
Julie lies twice: she says, her mother lived in Nizza (in reality, she is dead, but of course Julie likes to imagine that her mother is still alive); she says, her mother had burnt the novel she has written (which she did not, because Julie gives the manuscript to Sarah, the writer ÂÂ> the book that Sarah gives to her publisher at the end of the film is the copied manuscript of Julies mother (we see her copying it at her computer).
Having said that,I'd say that I'm probably more comfortable in the latter type of film than the former,but this movie is still a nice change of pace where that's concerned.
Later on, when she makes love to one of a few random men she finds during her nights out, Sarah cannot hep but become interested and observes in the same composition before later still, there actually is a reaction shot from Sarah, during another sex act in the house's swimming pool from which the title derives.
This all comes together at the end when you meet the real daughter - the symbolism still keeps me thinking of each scene and what it actually meant.
And even late in life, he was still a good singer, having been a great one earlier.
By 2003, cheap exploitation cinema had become less popular in Italy; but Bruno Mattei was still making movies and apparently he didn't see any reason to stop this often practiced tradition of ripping off American movies, and saw fit to reinvent John McTiernan's Predator and splice it together with another popular American export, the cannibal movie, and what we have as the result is this film.
Great director he still managed to all the filmings in Philippines.
The others weren't as good in my opinion, but I have still given ten points because I think that somehow (forgive the worn-out phrase) the whole is more than the sum of its three parts.
Yet on this second viewing I still felt it worth my time.
However, Europeans were still deeply affected by the war even in the mid-fifties (see "Act of Love," another film of Douglas's).
It may hide behind the alternate title "Hard to Die," and utilize the stage name "Arch Stanton" (the name on the grave in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) for director Jim Wynorski, but with most of the same cast returning and with reused ideas and recycled flashbacks, Sorority House Massacre III is still very much the same cheesy movie.
And it still felt like the writers had no clue what each other were doing.
unfortunately the dvd transfer puts the film in full frame, but one still gets the impression that the cinematographer knew what he was doing.
The attempt succeeded with the title, but that still leaves the movie itself.
And it is still better, as stated earlier, than the same director's "Rush of Fear" - which I sincerely hope BBC1 doesn't show in the same slot that this TV movie was in; it would hurt us Rosanna Arquette fans a lot if it was scheduled after little sister Patricia in "Medium" as well...
Like when Len and Squiggy died and I cried my boyfriend had to tell me that even if the researcher's hadn't been there and this hadn't been broadcast it still would have happened.
I have over 20 episodes of Airwolf and I still can't get enough of it...  Airwolf is piloted by String-Fellow Hawke, an elite combat pilot, who would only return the awesome machine if the top-secret F.I.R.M can find his brother (MIA).
My favourite was and still is Flower, she was a great leader and she lead the family with an iron paw (as the narrated said in one episode).
I also loved Sharkespeare and still wonder what happened to him.
While the way these dreams aren't integrated perfectly, it is still a great idea and a lot of fun to watch.
That said, HE DID AND HE DIDN'T is still one of the best films he made during this period, just not so much, I think, for the sake of comedy.
Mabel wakes up, confused and still in shock, and Roscoe strangles her in frustration.
That photo is a publicity still from 'He Did and He Didn't', though it doesn't actually correspond to any scene in the film as it now exists.
'He Did and He Didn't' is an astonishing film: quite removed from the lowbrow slapstick of Arbuckle's early Keystone efforts, yet still extremely funny.
Add in Arbuckle's casual gags and the result is an excellent comedy that is still highly watchable -- except, of course, when you are trying to make sense of real-life nephew Al St. John's awful mugging and high-speed rowdyism.
Director Edward L. Cahn was the best kind of journeyman director, a true pro who could take a talented cast, a few small sets, and a genre-based script, and turn it all into a solid, unpretentious feature film that still entertains and engages decades after it was made.
Monroe, even with her sometimes doe-eyed stupor, is still captivating---I am a fan, and part of her appeal to me is her sometimes obvious lack of polished acting tricks.
Put her and James Dean in a grave together (maybe with Marlon Brando who seems incongruous in this company only because he's still alive).
and making prophecies was also unbelievable.But this is still a movie!
You know whats going to happen long before it does, and when it does, it looks good, but it's still not very fulfilling.
I know this from a bunch of older films, but this is definitely the only film from the late 60s I've seen, that still uses this form of dubbing, which really needs getting used to.
But it's still at ten.
Besides some of the plot holes that I still can't figure out, I was rather captivated by The Dying Gaul.
In The Dying Gaul he plays Robert, a gay screenwriter who is still mourning the death of his lover, Malcolm.
He still sleeps with Malcolm's pajamas and puts them back into a Ziploc baggie at the end of each night.
Even as the film prattles on about mythic themes and makes references to famed art and literature, yet sells out to a lame technological gimmick, it still has potential.
Clarkson plays the housewife who still has a job even though she could easily live off of her husband's wealth, and she's not as clueless as many other movie housewives are.
Robert has lost his life partner and is still suffering the loss.
Flaws and all, this is still a mature and well thought out film.
Although the movie takes advantage of Los Angeles locations, including a stunning hilltop home (complete with infinity pool, of course), it still feels very much like a play especially in Lucas's use of talking head-shots and voice-overs to amplify the ennui of the chat room activity.
The back and forth exchange here is unusual, and striking in that it is meaningless when taken out of context, but highly enlightening when considered in relation to the film's plot, as this sample shows: "Hello"; "I hear clicking"; "I'm still here"; "Are you still there?
It's good and it works in a structural way, but I'm still unsure whether it works emotionally.
Granted, the technology still remains unable to fully replicate the spark and nuance of actual human performance, but early in the piece, it becomes very clear that Zemeckis and co. have come damned close.
Most people still think that the Andresen's Little Marmaid is an happy ending story because of the Disney cartoon.
Although it is 10 years ago, you can still have a better feeling and know how some lies can be so contagious and outrageous.
It could almost be considered a crash course on what is still going on in China today.
But the plot is still interesting the film throughout and other than a few twists that seemed unnecessary, keeps focus until the end.
The chase scene through the city is very exciting although at times farfetched, but still makes for some good action in between a few dramatic scenes.
Even without on screen violence ala American History X or Saving Private Ryan, this film still manages to invoke fear simply knowing that the Chinese will do whatever they please, regardless of human life.
(sort of) As of now, it's 9:32, so about Â¾'s of the movie have passed, & those damn guys are still trapped.
It still looks incredibly fresh today.
I just saw it this week after not seeing it since the 70's, and the film stands the test of time marvelously -- still as fresh, funny, and involving as when I saw it originally.
I still love it.
Stuart Gordon still has his touch...
Fortress was his first entry to non-horror oriented field, even though Fortress still has many horror elements, too.
This is not as satiric or intelligent as Paul Verhoeven's Robocop, for instance, but still it is little more than just average blast 'em action film set in the future.
Christopher Lambert is not as multi leveled actor as possible, but still he has certain kind of charisma and he is easy to watch in his films.
It's not a masterpiece but still very noteworthy piece of 90's science fiction and action cinema.
One of the best films of the Silent era, right from the start: the stunt where Fairbanks gets to a balcony by means of a rope, a donkey, and a sleeping fat man is still one of the funniest in movies.
These actors quirks are so strong that vestiges of their humanity still manage to come across in there on-screen avatars/characters.
Some of the special effects still look good especially the flying carpet scenes and creating the million man army, but the rest for the main are primitive Â however if you're unfortunate enough to see any of the laughable modern versions, maybe some with eye-splitting digital cartoonery too you'll realise special effects do not make a great movie.
It tells its story visually, but still manages to be engaging and earthily human.
The fact is that this film's audience was probably people who didn't go to the movies often, and were still amazed by the novelty of moving pictures.
This scene, identical in the beginning and end of the movie, go against the traditional rule of "Show, don't tell", but the scene is still a very artistic and beautiful way to bookmark such a film.
The sets are magnificent, the effects fascinating, and all the actors pulled out the stops, many of their performances still remarkable by modern standards.
Douglas Fairbanks was already well into his middle-age but he was still doing his own physical stuntwork and female-pleasing in his looks and charms.
I thought it was terrific then, and after viewing it again now(2003) I still think it is an exceptionally fine movie.
Some of the bands you'll see here went on to commercial success (check the very early footage of Talking Heads and Blondie) and some are still propping up the "influential" lists thirty years on (Television and Patti Smith just played sold-out painfully hip gigs in London last month) and some verge on performance art (Wayne/Jayne County) and some are just plain forgotten (Marbles, Tuff Darts).
Music fans should be happy someone bothered to capture the CBGBs scene while it still was a scene.
It didn't really have very much of a movie feel to it after the first few minutes or so but I still enjoyed it and hope Ms. Lansbury's in good enough health to make a new `episode' or two.
Despite these errors, minor flaws, I still find the Celtic riddle to be the greatest film to be released in 2003.
She never got the chance to try as much comedy as mom was still the star.
While this is not quite as strong as the earlier series, it still has some great moments.
I take funny over bitter myself, but that is why this show like many situation comedies put a little realty in, but still were living in a never-never land.
Not as good as "I Love Lucy" but its still worth watching.
But even so, I still loved that dancing doll of Lucille Ball.
He's really cool in this film, and he was cooler from "The Lost Boys" and I think he's still the Prince of Scary Movies.
But worry not, his humor is still free and easy, unlike his cryptic (no pun intended) football commentaries.
Despite it's problems Bordello Of Blood still manages to be an enjoyable tongue in cheek piece of hokum for lovers of the genre, but it's unlikely to convert anyone else, and isn't a patch on the first Crypt film.
In spite of itself it did manage to hold my attention and mostly entertain during it's relatively short length, mainly due to the afore mentioned great performance of Dennis Miller, but it still should have delivered more than it manages to.
I still can't believe that Robert Zemeckis took part to this fiasco called Tales from the Crypt.
Nathan Lane plays the part of a woman so well that I still find myself forgetting that SHE is a HE.
If you don't like anime, you'll still like Oh My Goddess.
How and why she's still acting is beyond me.
You know it's happening, but the scene when his mom goes into his room and finds him dead in bed still can't help but put a few tears in your eyes.
The predudice is handled well and sadly we still have the same predudices present in our society today ( will we never learn?)
Cher as his mother, and Estelle Getty and Richard Dysart as her long-suffering parents; she is a rebel/Hell's Angel (apparently this was also true) and fights an uphill battle to give Rocky some kind of life while he still has the chance.
Between coping with his mom's antics, dealing with the prejudice he encounters and the debilitating migraines he suffers from, Rocky still manages to win over his teachers and classmates, becoming an inspiration to them.
The fact that the cities Jarmusch chose are iconic world places and that the director 'knows the night' of every one of them and shoots them brilliantly and similarly and trying to tour them all is a remarkable fact, but still I don't feel the necessity of mentioning the cities in this review.
From Taxi Driver-esquire cinematography with cameras mounted atop taxis swimming through the street-lights of the world to the most unexpected characters to come out of those we assume will be something else, it's worth watching and could still be a 10/10.
The poem has been dechristianized: On the one hand, it does take out a glaring anachronism (the action of the poem takes place during the Migration Period of the AD 400s-500s, when they would still be following the traditions of the Aesir religion, but the poem was written down in a very Christianized context in England, and the anachronism does add a richness to the language) The only sop to the underpinnings of the source material come in a discussion between two urinating Danes over the relative merits of Christianity and Aesir-worship, and later when Unferth suggests praying to Christ as well as Odin, a suggestion that Hrothgar rejects out of hand (perhaps a reference to the opposite situation in the poem, where the Danes throw off Christianity for a time, hoping that the old gods will smite Grendel where the Christian ones had apparently failed).
Night on Earth isn't quite as trippy as Jarmusch's later film; but it still oozes that odd sense of cool and while you're watching it you're constantly reminded that what you are seeing isn't just any film.
The third remains the more ambiguous, and maybe more uncomfortable, segment of the bunch, and even if it might be the lesser of them all it's still fascinating due to the actors.
The fifth pairing of Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner is still good and features many gags that work, including a tiger trap, a pop-up steel wall, a motorcycle, a unfateful encounter with a train (Stop in the name of humanity), and a box of Acme-brand leg-building vitamins.
It still brings back many fond memories.
I liked it then, and I still like it now.
I still have the old VHS copy of the movie, but would like to find and purchase a newer copy so that someday my kids could enjoy it as well.
Well, it's still that way but you can now view it in uncut form, thanks to the marvels (?)
It isn't that gory but the idea of such an act, which thankfully was never repeated in another film, still has the potential to disturb.
Turns out a cannibalistic weirdo still roams the island, just waiting to pick off anyone who crosses his path.
The story is drawn out slowly and the island sets and backdrops are simultaneously beautiful and yet still creepy and atmospheric at the same time.
That scene is pretty cool - but is very short and still appears to be cut down.
Overall, not my favorite D'Amato film - I'll still stick with BUIO OMEGA or EMANNUELLE IN America - but ANTHROPOPHAGOUS is worth a look too, if you go into it knowing that you'll have to wait a while for the "pay-off"... 8/10
The version I saw was the recently released 2 disc 'uncut' edition from media blasters/shriek show and I swear that it was still cut.
Even so, unless they cut out a huge helping of gore and interesting plot, it would still suck hard.
That said, this movie was still the most boring, uneventful piece of trash I've ever witnessed.
The plot was so sluggish I wanted to shoot myself (there was plenty of fast forwarding after sitting thru the first 30 minutes), the gore was limited and/or nonexistent, the fetus eating scene looked like it was cut and it was still boring as balls.
It was never frightening and some effects are really poorly done as the head in the bucket and the death of the blind girl, when they zoom in on her you still can see her breath.
What I think he did better than most schlock was that he used actual tricks of the scary movie trade, rather than just thinking of the most vomit worthy ideas imaginable (which are still present here).
The terrified survivors then set out to unravel the mystery, rescue the still missing Maggie, and find the strange disappearing woman.
After these scares, it manages to keep the atmosphere, because whatever is stalking them, whatever this monster is trying to kill them is still an unknown to the audience.
What makes him scary is that you can see that he's still just a man.
I've probably watched the whole series over 10 times and I still watch t every night!
I hate how they canceled the show right at that point, it drives me nuts thinking about it.I wish they had of even starting filming the 3 series with those actors now, even though most of them are in their thirties and a few of the older actors are dead, but it would still be interesting.
I still do watch it every night, I'm addicted, i cant stop watching that show, i love it too much!
I don't know how high schools are now, but I still think that some of the themes explored are slightly misleading, and stereotypical.
I blame that for the corruption of todays youth =P  things the show taught me about: mean people, racism, homophobia, sex, STDs,alcoholism, animal cruelty, transsexuals, homelessness, leukaemia, relationships, prejudice, exorcism, that overweight people have feelings too, working, teen marriage, that sometimes conjoined twins might want to stay attached, about chickens, pregnancy, adoption, substance abuse, blackmail, ulterior motives........and the list goes on  even if it had taught me nothing I'd still have loved this show - maybe even just for Mary cherry =D  it annoyed that there was the 'in group', who were meant to be superficial and uncaring and the 'out group', supposedly the opposite.
The theme is mature(sex/drugs), while still being light hearted and funny.
If only the ones it was made for had watched....it would probably still be on.
I disagree with another poster's assertion that Minnie Driver was cast for her "star power"; at the time of this film she was mostly known for CIRCLE OF FRIENDS and (somewhat) for GOLDENEYE, and was still part of that indy-film group of actors that included Scott, Tucci, etc.
I still am marveling at the choice of Ian Holm as the crazy and ultimately destructive Pascal, but it definitely worked in the film.
Roger Ebert gave 'Big Night' four stars; I would give it 3 1/2, but it is still way out in front of most films these days.
The desperate Fernando Rey, the older, richer, still amorous over-the-hill desires his eighteen-year-old Conchita and the game begins.
I still enjoy thinking about it.
Now I see, we're still able to make fantastic movies.
If anything the ending is most frustrating, as after all that's happened and been told, and even after the seeming break-up, they're still together.
His actual movement of the camera as well- which is often sort of intricate and precise and seamless and actually really powerful even in quiet scenes- shows how someone on his last film can still have the great sweep of his prime running through.
The final shot, by the way, is like one last wink to the audience- if not a totally spectacular one- that still is in my mind after the film has ended.
Chaplin actually plays the part of a more well-to-do individual, but he is still very recognizable, with the traditional look that Chaplin always seems to have.
Also, he still manages to get into plenty of the high-paced and very amusing scuffles that are almost as much of a trademark in his films as that outfit.
Although meaningless liberties have been taken with this true story - what possible difference, for example, could it have made to acknowledge that Mitchell was married rather than imply bachelor status - it still grips in an understated way.
It's all plot and not real, but still, I would have scratched that line, as there is no supporting evidence that Val- the center of this tornado- is anything but selfish.
Military historians from then till now still debate the value of the airplane in war.
The themes and issues it raises are still very much relevant; sexual desire and frustration, the nature of desire, terrorism, the conventions within society that we accept.
Although totally exhausted from a day at the salt mines, I still couldn't turn off the TV.
Stranger still with the picture is that Jackson and Botes almost have a kind of affection for the MacKenzie character- and as the former later displayed with his brawny popcorn epics- that even makes the material not too shallow in terms of approach for the viewer.
This is a great place for BuÃ±uel newbies, it's got his personal touch of the surreal, but it's still linear and coherent enough like a normal Hollywood movie to be enjoyed by the average movie-goer.
But I was still thankful to Jackson and Botes for making me believe it and making me feel that fascination.
I still treasure Forgotten Silver in my video collection as the best documentary I have ever seen.
Almost 20 years and numerous investigations and commissions later still the whole truth has not come to see the light of day.
For now, however, it has left me full and still digesting.
The ending may suggest that in some way he has won, or more likely that they are still at a standoff, even while the terrorists escalate the bombings.
Tap was still around but on its way out; a kind of jazz-ballet blend was becoming mainstream; the avant-garde was a more dramatic and angular "modern" dance.
I'm still not a fan of the throwing(and it gets to be downright common, here), but they kind of had to have it, after it appeared in Mysteries of the Sith.
The latter group is, for example, the first two Prince of Persia games, and both this and the third game(where the focus still laid largely laid in the second of the two categories) of that series attempt for a mix... in the case of both, the result is that you can hack and slash away effortlessly and, more by chance than anything else, take out boss enemies and other players.
In this game, there is still an unmistakable requirement of skill, if nothing or nowhere else, then when you face multi-player foes that are superior, and possibly a boss enemy or two, as well.
Unfortunately I still heard it.
Of course, he doesn't vocalize his speech: he transmits it through the air-but i think that this is still somehow remarkable (I think).
Many symbolic films are so twisted that they became pointless to anyone not still trying to earn that "A" in Filmology 101.
than anything concrete since I'm still pondering the film and wondering when I'll be able to see it again.
I thought I had a handle on it going in after reading about it and still I was surprised by what the film really was up to.
Photographer Joe Rosenthal caught the soldiers' images in an iconic still that captured a perfect moment and reinvigorated the U.S. war effort against the Japanese.
I have to say that this film was eastwoods better works of history.The ability to bring out the real feelings in people about how we view the human race in general.I enjoyed this film for the simple reason that WWII was a turning point in how we see each other.How to come together in the highest need to overcome obstacles in the darkest hour.As the flag was raised and having a photographer just at that moment to take a picture of the flag being raised,coincidence flew out the door.But the film goes further as we see each one remembering the pain it created,from a simple misunderstanding about who gets what flag and why.If anything the flag should have went to the soldiers who fought there at iwogima.But like the narrations pointed out,it was a forgotten past and the hero's also forgotten.It's sad to think that the human race no longer sees why war is not necessary,just as long as money is made in the name of war is what it's all about.They were right though,without the money it would have been lost to the Japanese at least that part of the world.But in reality it would still be Japanese soil.This film impacted on all sorts of levels,financial gain through war,the soldiers dying because of money being made,artillery paid for by millions of people,and the suffering going home without so much as a thank you for keeping the world safe.In reality the soldiers who fought and died i would like to call real hero's.No matter what flag was planted,and why today most of the yesteryear men and women are nearly gone.I have to say this film gave me a bit more understanding why war is becoming a thing of the past.We don't need it and don't want it,flag or not we need this world safe and i think Mr. Eastwood gave us a good vision of it becoming a reality.So go ahead make his day.
Here's the star of spaghetti westerns, Dirty Harry himself, who has aged but still showing no signs of slowing down.
People are willing to accept heroes but only under fanfare and while they are still the flavour of the month.
Neal McDonough & Barry Pepper are great (pepper is older but still hot...fell in love with his bible-quoting sniper in SPRyan).
In a time where America is fighting two separate wars in Afghanistan and Iraq with veterans of Vietnam still being paraded on CNN every evening news to discuss comparisons, Flags of our Fathers is important in that it shows how a single picture or event can change an entire opinion over an effort that will cost young men and women their lives.
So why does Flags of our Fathers still get 3 Â½ stars even though the comments seem so negative?
As a minor spoiler alert: please be sure to stay through the film's closing credits for a thoughtful montage of still photographs of the Battle of Iwo Jima, as well as the three protagonists, Bradley, Gagnon, and Hayes.
i think itz a really really really really goood film, i saw it 3 times n' still not bored.
But even with this flaw, the fight scenes still manage to be very entertaining, My personal favourites are The Dojo fight (where Jet utilises Fillipino Escrima stick fighting) and the fight with the 2 albino twins where Jet outnumbered and outsized by his opponents, uses his environment and his speed to defeat them.
although i really like this movie ....i still wouldn't want a kiss of the dragon though (you'll understand after seeing the movie)  Germy
I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and aside from the car chase, I still get 'tingles' when watching the fight scene with the tall and short guys in the office, the soundtrack playing during this scene works very well with it.
In fact, we get just the opposite--a man who simply loves his job and does it very well, but is still human enough to make mistakes, feel pain and make realistic choices (well, mostly).
But despite its few formulaic shortcomings, Kiss of the Dragon still delivers.
However, it is still a made for TV biopic - the historic characters are necessarily painted a little bland and it is inescapably "light entertainment".
Given Winston's anti-Nazi views, Churchill surprisingly had supported the intended nuptials, but maybe as he was still in his "wilderness years" at the time, could have had his own agenda in mind.
In Luis Bunuel's autobiography, "My Last Sigh" (A fantastic book, still in print) the director discusses the reason for this unique directorial device, and how funny he finds it that so many "fans" assume that the choices were based on the actresses temperment or his desire to "express" something obscure.
If the edited parts are still available this movie would warrant a restoration to its original vision.
Director Stuart Walker helms this unabashedly grim WWI drama with tact and honesty, featuring some above average aerial footage and an unflinchingly blatant anti-war message that is still quite surprising and daring for a depression-era studio film.
Helen Gallagher played the matriarch and she is still a fabulous actress who has done television, stage, and films as well.
Today Hale and Kirstin are still soap actors, as was Roscoe Born until recently, while Hindman, Mulgrew, Bersen, Daniel Hugh Kelly and Helgenberger went on to TV series fame (Hindman was the neighbor in "Home Improvement").
Today, I'm even more shocked that he's still on.
I still remember trying to finish up last-minute stuff, have my shower and get ready for school the next day in time to watch "Life Goes On" (and on many occasions, "America's Funniest Home Videos" after that) Often I would be running late, and would watch "Life Goes On" in my parents bedroom, practically still dripping wet, wearing a bathrobe, with my hair wrapped up turban-style in a towel to air-dry as my dad ironed his work clothes, and I watched the show.
But "Life Goes On" (and a few very select others), had and still does have a very special place in my heart!
Even when there is nothing at all on TV it is still better than The Late Show.
He has done the show since 1993 and is still keeping the spirit of doing talk shows and entertaining everyone.
That is when I started to like it, since BB5 it has still been a great show.
SUMMER would not be the same without this show anymore as its now going into its eight year running and still going strong.
And still the public watched.
I'm still waiting for another classic like this one.
despite this, i still think the show is great.
Since then,there has been an explosion of similar publications,perhaps not quite as cringingly oily to the so-called famous as the aforementioned terrible twins,but if anything even less intelligent and brainless,with similarly garishly coloured photos thrown in for good measure.I am sure there are still plenty of talented writers,actors,singers,comedians,dancers,etc.
that are still out there in Britain,but the TV executives today do not seem to agree,or they are not bothered at finding and encouraging new talent.They are happy now to let talent-free non-entities appear on this show,and others,to create,Frankenstein-like "celebrities",which is rapidly becoming the dirtiest,most foul word for disgruntled UK citizens like myself in this day and age.This word "celebrity" has almost taken on a new meaning from previous generations;it was usually tagged on in the past to famous people,but those who had mostly obtained their fame through talent,sheer hard work and years of struggle.
I wonder if Orwell (if he were still alive that is) would be happy to find that one of his character's names is used as the title for such an excuse for a show, I think not!
The basic idea of this show tanked in other countries where the people are more intelligent but somehow, five years after the rank original, the people of Britain still buy into this crap.
They still fall for the same old, same old rubbish that was boring first time around.
It portrays a fantasy America, still routed in Wild West mores and justice.
He embarks on a road trip to get to former girlfriend, who still loves him, in the picturesque village of Cedar Falls.
There were still a few surprises to come in the noir cycle (Kiss Me Deadly, The Big Combo, The Killing, Touch of Evil), but by 1954 just about every theme and plot point had already been used and recycled.
Deftly, she circumvents an opened ladder, but still her car won't start.
Derivative it may be (corrupt cop, duplicitous blonde), but Pushover exemplifies the swift, hard-edged and unsentimental turn that film noir had taken during the Eisenhower Administration; it's still one of the better titles from the dwindling days of the cycle.
many years ago as a teenager myself (many Oates' works were translated to Russian - she was and I hope still is very popular there), I've been fascinated by it.
Everything is still told from the point-of-view of 15-year-old Connie, increasingly estranged from her mother and marveling at her new-found attractiveness to boys.
One of the early serial killer flicks and it still packs a punch.
A movie that is easy to watch, funny and fun and still allows so many big names a little early days fun.
We still treasure this movie and watch it again and again.
Buckaroo "(pauses) You have a point there" - Tommy, still crack me up.
Things do eventually start to happen and its still no great shakes at all, with uninspired action, lamely edited deaths and a lack of gore.
I know he's older, but some of that 80's 'action star' persona comes through really nicely, and he still has amazing charisma in front of the camera.
I'm still trying to figure out why I liked this movie back then.
So it must have been the creature, which looks reasonable (but still rubbery) and fairly dangerous when it shows its teeth, but it moves way too slow.
Esily, the worst of the Ernest line, but there are still lessons to be learned, and enjoyment to be had.
He enjoyed a rather large following while he was alive, and many still love him and his works.
I have seen it maybe only 3 times in all these years (am 53 now), and it still never failed to have me so emotional at the end.
But - yes, it was still a "nice" film and I wouldn't knock it for that.
Kudos, hugs, and kisses to anyone still alive who helped put it together.
The railroad setting, though, was something I have never seen dealt with in such a fashion (and makes me wish an "Atlas Shrugged" film could have been made when trains were still important).
It's a film that deserves a second look, without a doubt - and thankfully the audio commentary with the director and writer explains so much, because without it you'll still be scratching your head and muttering "what the hell was that all about..." In particular, that strange, terrifying Eastern-block country Gideon finds himself in.
It's still called "100 Women" here in Australia, and I don't think I would have bothered to see this if I was unaware of it's connection to 100 Girls.
100 Women is basically the same movie, but done better this time around (although still not perfect).
So he decides the low self esteem is his True Love and the Model gave him the half heartbroken, "lets be friends so I can still be around you" bit.It just didn't seem to fit the light-heartedness that prevailed through most of the movie.
The entire plot is so hard to swallow and the lead's reaction to the plot-twist is so unreal, but at the same time it still is entertaining.
The special effects really aren't so important in this kind of movie, but they are still quite well done.
I almost thought it was real(for a split second of course)and the fact that the year 2005 is Just around the corner, theirs still no manned space flight or a women president,But 2010 is right around the bend so maybe then.
Gregory Peck's damaged pilot is still suffering from a bad case of 12 O'Clock High after the death of his wife in an air raid on their wedding night until he falls for Burmese girl Win Min Tan.
It's not much of a plot, true, but it's handled extremely well thanks to Robert Parrish's direction, which is surprisingly strong, direct and imaginative when called for, but still knows when to be unobtrusive as well.
I'm sure many teenage boys enjoyed it just for Jessica Alba (though I admit I had a crush on her myself when I was a teenager) but I still loved it.
Jeff Bridges and Martin Landau deserved Oscars (Landau was nominated) for their portrayals of Preston Tucker and his friend/manager, Abe Karatz--they show the intelligence, drive, and unquenchable dynamism of the American businessman in their quest to build the 'perfect automobile', only 50 of which were ever built but of which 44 are still on the road today!!!
Fortunately, 46 of the Tucker automobiles that were produced are still road worthy and highly collectible.
Like Scorsese, Hitchcock, and Ford, Coppola's second-tier works are still head and shoulders above the films of less talented directors.
Although I love this movie and the way it was filmed and the fact that finally someone told the truth about Tucker, I am still a little saddened.
Bortko followed the book faithfully enough but still removed some crucial scenes and added a ridiculous character played by Valentin Gaft made up to look like Beria.
but up to that point there are numerous comic gems, so this movie is still worth seeing.
it looks like these kids wanted to make a schlocky gore version of the real tragedy for their friends because they weren't satisfied with still pictures in the news or the few clips from CCTV available on the internet.
A couple of years back when this movie was still fresh on the market, I had the interest of obtaining it and watching it.
I would never pay more than ten bucks for a dubbed copy of a film, and still, even that seems like too much.
He's a forty year old french man who still has childish eyes and he sees the world in a very unusual way.
Certainly Caligula is portrayed as a madman always on the verge of some tyrannical rage and concurrent action but he is still very recognizably a multi-leveled character in the hands of the superb acting of an often overlooked great actor John Hurt.
If you're still keen for a bit of Roman when you've completed the series, the movie Quo Vardis picks up where it left off, dealing with Emperor Nero's reign (Nero is well played by Christopher Biggins in I Claudius and Peter Ustinov in the movie).
It still was jarring to see Germanicus' wife looking more like his mother...ditto Augustus and Livia.
Eventually, I decided to buy it, and it still remains one of my favorite DVD box sets.
In the mini series there are some minor anachronisms and some events are out of sequence, but it still captures the political intrigue of the imperial family in ancient Rome.
One of the finest pieces of historical drama I have ever seen, if only the BBC could still produce such quality television.
On a second viewing, (all the way through, this time), the Uncle Olie character is not so freaky, and the whole film is very nicely done, though the sound quality is a little off and the opening titles are still very trippy.
"A Return to Salem's Lot" by Larry Cohen is not as bad as it's reputed to be.In fact I used to watch it pretty often when I was a kid.Of course it's not as scary or suspenseful as Tobe Hooper's "Salem's Lot",but it still manages to entertain if you are in the right mood.The acting is terrible as is the make-up of the vampires,but there is enough amusing moments to make the viewer smile.Samuel Fuller is quite memorable as a Vampire slayer.Overall,"A Return to Salem's Lot" is a quirky,occasionally uneven horror film that is worth a look for fans of Larry Cohen's unusual horror movies.7 out of 10 and that's being kind.
Thus I still have no idea how it ends, and I walked out of it over 10 years ago...
Despite the low budget and limited locations, Trinity still looks and feels like a work of art.
Even still, this doesn't save this sequel from being poor.
At the end of the day, there aren't many films you can return to after taking a leak and not realise that's it's still paused for 10 seconds.
I had heard that this movie wasn't typical Van Damme, but I still expected it to be mindless action on the whole.
As if her being a still distraught widow weren't enough, she is also being harassed to a rather unreasonable degree by Ted Levine, who is hilarious and brilliant and the land developer's chief henchman.
Still what I find brilliant and special with this film, is that all though child abuse is a main theme, it is still a film where you laugh.
That SchÃ¸nau Fog can make a film about such a horrific subject and still make you laugh.
You know what is coming, but you still can not wait till it does.
Then the mockumentary melts away into a horror movie where you *think* you know exactly what's going to happen even though every time you think you know what's going to happen you're wrong, then every time you guess and you're still wrong.
How the doors slam shut at just the right moment, how the perfect weapons are always available to the killer while the victim can't seem to find anything to protect himself or herself, and how the killer manages to let all the other promiscuous teenagers in the vicinity know that there is a killer on the loose and yet still manage to pick them off one by one.
While it is a parody movie, it still adds its own terrifying elements.
The main flaw I can see is that only horror buff will get the maximum enjoyment out of this film, but it's still a fun low budget and original film, I really liked the concept.
He is a guy at work, albeit disgusting and immoral work, he is still a guy at work.
I still strongly recommend Behind The Mask and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
The only reason i watched this film is because it was free, and i still feel cheated.
I was (and still am) very into the monster/sci-fi genre.
I remember commenting back around that time that the Planet of the Apes TV series looked like Starsky and Hutch vs the apes and I still feel that way when I see clips of the old ape TV show.
It still conveys a good antiwar message which, in this day of Home Land Security and international political blundering, we all might do well to remember.
Nowadays, amazing things can be done with 3D animation, making characters look more realistic, but for some reason, they still have an unnatural feel to them.
This level of realism within Gulliver is still astounding today, almost seventy years after the film's production.
A few years later, he went on to direct the Superman cartoons, which are still held in high acclaim for their animation style and techniques of realistic movements and absorbing story lines.
He wouldn't let them cut the model from his hands, so they bring him into the hospital with the ship still attached to his hands as nautical music played in the background.
Although it dates from the days when animated films were still finding their feet it lacks the honour of being a pioneer.
They made the 17 classic Superman shorts that still spellbind people today, including myself.
Despite being over the top, it still manages to be realistic and the French director has proved that he isn't one to hold back the bloodthirstiness of a movie with this picture.
I still wouldn't miss anything he's done.
I still do have them on VHS.
Even with the weaknesses that are clearly present, I'm still going to 8/10 for this.
This show was a staple of my childhood and I find that I still connect to the humour and drama, even if the medicine is out-of-date.
The characters were so well-developed that I still find myself hooked to their trials, tribulations, and triumphs.
People asked if I were in "The Rose" during my performances - and do still today wherever I happen to be - and I tell them I was, but it was only another job - as it was just that.
This is a movie from 1979, a time when rock and roll was still considered a lifestyle, and big rock bands were treated with absolute god-like adoration.
The play itself was a real downer; a man (Edmund O'Brien) is still living with his mother and sister although he's in his mid twenties.
Despite this, her two grown children still live with her!
Unlike Laura, he is more open in his disdain for his mother and her annoying ways...yet he eventually does what she wants AND is still at home though he looks to be in his 30s.
Finally, this movie contains poor TV actors and has a rotten script and minute budget for the special effects, but it is still one of the most entertaining TV movies ever made.
LOST is definitely the better written show but still, it would have been nice for DANGER ISLAND to have had a better chance!
Even though the direction is uneven (but gets better in the last half) it carries a powerful message which still has meaning 3 decades later.
It has less sex than the series "Queer as Folk",or cable "Adult Movies", yet still communicates this aspect of gay relationships.
The surprising thing when viewed from an historical perspective, is that society's attitudes toward diversity have changed little and gay people are still struggling with the problems presented in this movie.
I hope they know they created a very special film that still can touch one's heart.
The parade sequences give added flavor and still timely food for thought.
A case in point is The Champion, still a relatively primitive piece that has no great meaning or comedic punch (pun unintended).
It's worth remembering that this was still only twenty years since the emergence of the first extensive film productions, and that it would have been sophisticated in its day.
Probably most notable for inspiring a sequence in "City Lights", this is still the era of large comedy moustaches and lack of screen realism.
But in The Champion, Chaplin proves that we can have well-developed characters, an easily discernible story, and still have enough action and solid slap-stick to keep the shorter attention spanned audience members entertained.
The show is still not great, but I gave it an 8/10 because it is now doing a good job at being exactly what it should be, a campy romp with clever dialog and just plain fun.
As much as I love the 1980 movie (just bought the savior of the universe edition) camp does not sell for comic book films(series) so it needs to be on a serious level but still fun The good qualities of this show....   1.
The way bond looks is pretty good but would have been better if they made bond look like one of the actors but who cares it is still fun to play.
We're still in it's first season and I think it's getting better with each passing episode.
Charles Middleton Ming from 1930's is still listed in Hollywood 100 top villains of all time.
Medals he hangs on his fathers grave, medals which are still there 2 years later (it was the 3rd annual marathon he won in a row)... Dumb on 2 counts, obviously the leaving the medals and having them stay there for years is dumb but it shows that even 13 years after his father died, Flash has yet to move on.
If the comics could be "re-imagined" into the Buster Crabbe serials, and the serials into the animated series, and all of that into the 1980 movie while still keeping the whole Flash Gordon spirit, how hard would it be to make a TV series that can do the same?
It's all very pointless and dull, and absolutely no match for the original, which is still charming after all these years.
'Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles' is a nice family comedy, that won't get you embarrassed in front of your parents and it will still make you laugh.
His innocence is still adorable after all these years, as it is his way of applying the laws of the jungle to the big city life.
Denzel treats them like they have a disease, but they still knock on his door.
In this movie, Mick Dundee is a family man, but still every inch the Aussie bushwhacker.
Yet he still manages to get by with his outback skills and "no-worries" amiability.
sure, it isn't the best thing i have ever seen and probably won't win any academy awards, but still...the return of the crocodile dundee character was wonderful.
First of all I never saw the first two Crocodile Dundee movie's personally I think its not a great movie but it is entertaining but some of the jokes ar not so funny but there are also a few good joke's but still I liked this movie paul hogan acting very well as Mick Dundee now I want to see the other 2 movie's and I heard they are better then this one if thats true then I really want to see them I give it a 7.5/10
Even after 13 years she is still a very beautiful and attractive woman.
(C-)  Note - I watched this film back to back with another British film "The Fourth Angel" which didn't receive rave reviews but was still head and shoulders above "For Queen and Country".
Yet "Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles" is still a pleasant and funny diversion.
Yes, Paul Hogan's Mick Dundee is still the same--still sweetly naive.
It suffered some after Stepfanie Kramer left, but it was still good.
This picture, is still worth a look just to watch this winning team together.
Fans of the movie should also view the inferior, but still funny See No Evil, Hear No Evil which sees the partnership of Wilder and Pryor re-ignited for a third time, following on from Stir Crazy and Silver Streak before that.
And now, at 26, the film is still just as funny as it always was.
The slapstick comedy, and jokes from Pryor and Wilder still have me laughing.
Maybe this is not quite as good as their first film together but it is still one of the best comedies around.
The film always leaves me with a good feeling and i have seen that it still works, even with kids these days.
They are still just as funny.
Not as good as the rest of the lineup, but still funny.
He still spins around in a whirlwind, sometimes through trees and rocks and drilling holes in the ground, and still makes sounds, rarely speaking in complete sentences (though he occasionally shows that he CAN talk normally).
He also still loves to eat, and is capable of consuming mass quantities in one gulp!
Watching episodes of this show now, I can still admire it for the animation (with beautiful backgrounds usually featuring yellow skies), musical scores, characters, etc., just like I did fifteen years ago, but it obviously isn't exactly the same.
This early 90's cartoon series was a success during its run, and still seemed pretty popular in the mid-nineties when I watched reruns of it, but unfortunately, it doesn't exactly seem like it ever was successful now.
And yet, there still hasn't been a DVD release of the cartoon, and reruns seem scarce.
This isn't a particularly great Tom and Jerry cartoon, but considering it was made during the absolute best period of animation from MGM (1941-1956), it still is a very, very good cartoon.
This is not one of my favorites, but by far still one of the better episodes.
"Texas Tom" isn't particularly one of my favorite Tom & Jerry's cartoons, but still it is great fun.
But if your heart still has the capacity to lead you in directions you don't expect, this film will have greater meaning for you.
Many of Rueben's friends are still involved in 'less than legal' occupations, and the poverty and wretchedness of the estate seems even worse than when he lived there before.
Silly and juvenile stuff but still pretty entertaining for a slow afternoon.
And throughout, Poirot subverts his beloved character with hyper-emotional exposition (for no good reason, given his lack of connection to the characters), a hitherto unrevealed religiosity, and a penchant for using 50-cent words that he's never before used, while still forgetting the English words for "thank you" and "yes".
I watched this series for nine years and it still never fails to entertain me.
But knowing him, they're probably still best friends.
I had no idea who he was until this movie came out, but that image is still burned into my brain.
A short such as 'Chute' with Al Parker and the far more gorgeous and naturally sexy Colt model Toby (it would be interesting to know what has happened to this long-ago, never-surpassed porn icon as well; I only know he is apparently still alive, but there must be something, since such illustrious authorities as 'Smutjunkies' have decided that, if they do know anything, it's on the q.t.)
And what is interesting is that, even with this strange persona still intact, he is to me visually by now quite beautiful--there was a cheap look to the self-conscious Peter Berlin of the tight white pants; by now, the mouth has widened and is more relaxed and he is by now at last a truly beautiful man.
This kind of 'dream person', though, tells about early childhood, and there is no follow-up about any further relationships with his family, leading one to assume he left them for good, and remains intoxicated with the days when he can still walk the streets and be told he's 'cute.'
He is definitely 'cute' now, and could afford to wear a lot of dressy things and be a great stylish older beauty by now, and the looser clothing he is seen in when interviewed in the film shows that his taste is still sharp.
All attendees certainly seemed as fascinated by the man as I was, whether or not they agreed with his lifestyle, or the values that he represented -- and still does.
I just saw it again at 41 and I still think it's great.
Not as good as "Let's Scare Jessica To Death" or "The Wicker Man", but still a must-see for people who are into this low-tech type of thing (like me).
I loved this movie when I was 12 years old... and I still have to say that, next to modern movies of this type (Anaconda, Arachnophobia), Frogs is still the champ!
The leech scene still disturbs me a bit... not so much for the gross-out special effects... but for the realistic sounds of distress from the actress (doesn't look like it would have been much fun to film this scene).
Milland's character is a bit too unbelievable, after all of his family's deaths he still wants to celebrate his birthday.
Despite its bad points, I really liked this film and it still delivers shocks albeit in small doses.
There have been persistent rumors that Rosaleen's first husband, an intrepid explorer, is still alive and as such would nullify her marriage to Gordon.
A predictable and sappy ending, but still a sweet little movie, with some hilarious one liners by Bob Hope and Lucille Ball.
Plus, just like in "Cards on the Table", we get to see Poirot back in his London apartment - actually, a different apartment, but still on the same building, Whitehaven Mansions.
Overall, "Taken at the Flood" may not be among the Top 5 Poirot episodes so far, but it's still better food for the brain than most of what is available out there.
Granted, most of those people were kids, we still enjoyed the show.
This adaptation might not always be completely true to Christie's original novel, but still a truly recommended hour and a half of well-made television!
Available in this box set is his 1959 Dino-fest, THE GIANT BEHEMOTH, the weakest of Lourie's monster movies, but still, a fun time at the movies.
Its the sort of thing that will appeal chiefly to an older fan base and younger folk with a taste for this sort of thing, it has at times a creakiness a hokeyness that it isn't quite classy enough to fully hold up against, but its still good fun.
Sadly to say still no DVD.
I watched the movie again last year and still found it compelling, albeit in a low budget way.
In the opening of the film, an American biologist, Steven Karnes (played by Gene Evans) is lecturing a group of scientists about the dangers of not only nuclear weapons testing, but the disposal of radioactive wastes- a warning still timely 45 years later!
The musical score, by Edwin Ashley, while not as bold as David Buttloph's for Beast, still provides both low key tension during non-monster sequences and dramatic enhancement during the monster's rampage.
I will agree with a previous poster that this period of sun Ra's music was far from his best, but still makes for a great soundtrack.
His wit still can be seen through the screen of the more strict narrative line seen in this movie but because the characters need to seem reasonably sane, their range is a bit restricted.
Okay, so John Carpenter's post-apocalyptic vision of the future didn't exactly come true, but "Escape From New York" still holds up as a darn fine low-budget sci-fi/action flick.
Snake Plissken (as played by Kurt Russell) is still one of the coolest anti-heroes ever to grace the silver screen, and the story still contains some great scenes and dialogue .
Ernest Borgnine serves up some welcome comic relief as the cheerful Cabbie, who's possibly the only happy person still living in New York.
Escape from New York is probably the first modern action movie, and still stands up pretty well.
When I grew up and saw it again, I found that unlike 99% of the stuff I'd thought was good when I was 14 years old, I actually still liked this movie almost as much as I originally did, but for completely different reasons.
Much better than the cheesy(but still good) sequel.
"Escape From New York" may be quite dated but it still packs a punch!
Conclusion: i highly recommend this cult classic and you must know that "Snake" is not dead, prove to that is that 26 years later he is still one of the best characters ever.
"Escape from New York" may well be seen as one of the better action movies of all times and even after 25 years it still gives me a good time when watching it.
Despite the fact that it was made in 1981, this movie still feels quite futuristic.
If they had set the date to 2097, this would still have been the same movie and then we wouldn't have know that this was impossible.
As a conclusion I would like to say that a good and still futuristic looking story, some good acting, several interesting action scenes,... make this movie more than just worth a watch.
What you do get is absolutely true-to-form with the rest of the film: Snake walks away after successfully completing his mission (and saving his own skin) and yet can still screw the authority and the society that put him in the situation to begin with...and you find yourself grinning in approval.
Nearly 25 years and an endless amount of viewings later, John Carpenter's "Escape from NY" still ranks high among the chosen few, quintessential cult films of the 80's.
Sure, it wasn't the height of intellectual humor by any stretch of the imagination, but it was still pretty damn funny.
My favorite part was the whole "Schach" bit, I still giggle when I think about it sometimes.
Don't get me wrong though, Trainspotting is still a great film but i prefer this.
Probably more of a bloke's film, but still fun for everyone.
Though thankfully Snow White is still Snow White.
It's been over two months since I've seen it, and I still laugh when I think of certain scenes.
It was still a critical stage for the series and a quality episode was required after the disastrous 'One for the Angels'.
The delivery and execution of classic lines are very good, and even though you know exactly what to expect, they still make you smile when they are delivered.
The year is 2006 now as I am writing this review, and I still remember it like it was yesterday.
I think i've seen it about 80 times & i still haven't got tired of it.
Sure Sandler still plays a goof ball with a annoying voice but "Happy Gilmore" makes me laugh even though it doesn't force me to do so.
But this movie is still good.
I have now seen this film too many times to even count and could probably recite the whole script along to the film, however it is still funny every time I see it.
Though nothing can beat "La Cage aux Folles," the film on which this American version is based, I still found "The Birdcage" delightful fun and hilarious at times, thanks to the comic geniuses of Robin Williams and Nathan Lane.
You'll still enjoy it.
While some gags are a bit predictable, there are still plenty of surprises and some outright lunacy that keep it fresh.
Even once you suds out what the Sandler formula is, the films are still enjoyable to watch.
Adam Sandler still has a great career ahead of him.
But there is still plenty there for those who don't speak the language and overall the plot and humor translates quite well.
I could watch this movie 50 times and still laugh.
I have seen it over 30 times, and I still laugh.
It feels almost weird to review a game that was made almost 10 years ago, but the fact that it still holds a place as one of the best games I've ever played speaks volumes of it's qualities.
We still talk about it.
This was a movie the entire family still talks about.
Although everybody knows the basic story, the film is still interesting and I had to laugh and smile a lot of times.
I still have headaches.
In fact, days later it was still sinking in and affecting me.
If I bought this movie, I would've thrown it away feeling so sorry that I bought it, avoid this at cost and look for better inspirational movie like Matilda even though it might be a little overrated and silly but still worth watching.
It also didn't help that it wasn't presented in the correct aspect ratio, so everybody was 'long' throughout the film (this was the Church's fault, not the film's, but it was still irritating).
I still am glad I went and would rather watch a movie like Indigo that is about redemption than the exploitation that we are exposed to daily in the media and especially Hollywood movies.
I am still receiving emails and phone calls a week later.
Absolutely tongue and cheek, this movie, even if flawed at times, is not limited by its micro budget and still manages to entertain.
But if you take that out, it is still a bad movie, technically and spiritually.
However though, regardless of all that "The Birdcage" still winds up hitting the nail square on the head in terms of delivering to it's audience some astounding energy, superb camp-value and knee-slappingly hilarious jokes/one-liners that are all topped by a nearly uncanny chemistry between the actors.
You'll still have people to talk to, but your circle is dwindling.
It's done with a semi-humouristic twist which makes it not all too sad through the movie, but is still meant to be taken seriously.
I still found certain parts of it to be funny... but I saw it as a much darker film than I'd initially thought.
Her desperate character still comes across but the accent is a little dodgy to say the least.
She's also in director John Crowley's "Intermission" (2003, script by Mark O'Rowe) - taken on, among the stellar cast, the rather offbeat yet still demure role of Sally (the script itself is plucky and unyielding alright - then again, it's probably quite 'normal' in the setting described) - another amusingly enjoyable film from Ireland if you're so gamed.
Yes, it's very, very wrong for Wilbur and Alice to sleep together--but the film _asks_ us to consider what sorts of desires drive people, desires both for love and death, and to suggest that they might actually love one another (as Wilbur and Alice love Harbour) while still betraying them.
it lets the mix of guilt and understanding linger while still bowing to and honoring to a desire for life and intimate human contact.
It's almost 30 years since I last watched Chico, but I still remember the theme song after all this time.
At dawn on Monday 27 June 1880, after a courageous stand-off at the Glenrowan Inn, Kelly emerged wearing his home-made plate metal armour and helmet, still firing at police, before being shot down and arrested.
"Hold That Lion" is still a gem, though.
The child actors are hilariously bad....do private schools still exist like this?
Writer, Producer and Star John Fallon (aka the one and only Arrow In The Head of the eponymous highly respected horror movie site) had previously stated that his intention (along with co-writer and Director Christian Viel) was to, ahem, deaden his disappointment at the 2004 remake of The Punisher, which for all its' good intentions and impressive visuals still pulled its punches where it counted, and create his own vision.
Usually even if Michael Caine stars in a bad movie he himself is still a pleasure to watch.
I still feel aggrieved.
Producer-director Reeve seems to think the film's suspense lies on whether he'll still be able to sing in the choir competition.
No surprise that this skipped theatres and went straight to ultra-cheap DVD, but you'll still find yourself wondering how and why it ever got made in the first place.
Harry Hamlin is believable, doesn't overact, and still looks as good as he did in the 80's on "L.A. Law".
This one may have been made in 90, but it still has the 'pure cop with chip on shoulder' guy.
Watch for a plot that while have some serious issues, is still passable and forgivably based on the movies final line.
The characters don't connect to each other on a dramatic level and you really don't feel for them, but they are still entertaining to watch.
extinguish or survive, or still alive in the "corner" where have been forgotten by the rest of the world.
I sure watched this movie too late at night and since the pacing is slooooow (and thats still a compliment) it got hard to focus on the plot.
Yes, there is still something new to do in this over-used "water running" room, where you are literally naked with nothing but skin and your fears.
Well, it is still a horror movie.
Is the twin still alive?
The movie shows a 1min swimming scene, and i still don't understand what that part had to do with the story.
THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is based on the bestseller by Jack Ketchum, which is based on the torture and murder of Sylvia Likens, a case which I did extensive research on to understand what this film was about, and compared to my research the actual events were certainly more brutal than what is shown in the film, but the film still packs a powerful punch, think of it as a semi truck packed full of mixed emotions, because thats what you'll feel like after you've watched this film, like you got hit by a truck and you're left with a bag of mixed emotions.
I am still deeply disturbed and have been for days after seeing this film.
Other reviewers seem to miss a motive for the atrocities, a reason for the escalation, apart from Ruths obvious derangement and general frustration with life, and ask why the others (especially since they're still kids) join in so easily.
I don't know, I'm still very disturbed by the movie.
And believe me, the worst was still to come for this girl.
As in David Lynch's 'Blue Velvet', the viewer realises that still waters run deep, that all will not be as it seems, making the anticipated revelation all the more shocking.
I'm still alive and kicking so the movie won't kill you.  
Eminem meeting Disney and a horror film (you'll know what I mean when you've seen the film), it really has not much of a plot, but it still is entertaining.
Well of course you might consider it offensive but I don't (OK I'm from Holland and we've brought you Paul Verhoeven) but still, you can't be offended if you have a sense of humour and if you remember this is ONLY a film.
Easily one of the most distinctive and talented young directors to come out of the 1990s, he still remains something of a 'cult' filmmaker, in spite of the $100-million box office take of "Seven," possibly the best, most intelligent serial-killer thriller ever unleashed on unassuming film patrons.
Well, I'm still not a fan of musicals, but I'm a fan of *this* musical, and am grateful to Parker and Stone for demonstrating that it's still possible to make a great movie on one's own terms.
From the droll opening strains of Mountain Town, to the Disneyesque "Up There," to the Les Miserables spoof, "La Resistance," South Park simultaneously sends up the genre while paying homage to it, and still finds room to use the songs to score delicious points against its myriad targets.
To accomplish that and still be known as the guys who made fart jokes and the F word popular is quite a feat.
Watched it recently, and still laughed out loud, even though nuclear annihilation is not much of a hot topic.
I would still highly recommend it for anyone searching for dark humor, sort of Monty-Python style.
You can see echoes of this still today; as an example, in the movie 'Saw', where the Jigsaw Killer seems to have a moral code not too dissimilar from John Doe (Kevin Spacey)'s one.
Since that time, I still believe the Stooges, especially Shemp-era material, is the greatest comedy of all time.
And if you still don't get it, try another twenty times.
At one and the same time, this is atypical of Fields' work generally, but still has his fingerprints all over it as well.
Despite its shortcomings, "Astro Boy" still proves humorously compelling when its hero spreads kindness courtesy of his cant-do-bad heart.
For the next fourteen minutes, he delivered an inaugural address that is still honored to this very day.
the fact is that it was, and still is.
I'm still not too sure of the impact that is likely to have on youngsters, but maybe that says more about me as a Dad than it does about kids, because those in the cinema seemed to enjoy it.
And when a movie teaches you something to make you evolve,and at the same time you enjoy and spend some quality time I think I can say that the goal of the movie was accomplished,they have set up the bar very high,but still,they managed to live up to the hype...which makes this movie a classic...1996...It seems like I saw it yesterday...
When I had first heard about this movie around about last summer, I was pretty excited to see it, even if people were saying it was a waste of time, I still had to see it because I knew it was based on an actual anime/manga series long ago, and because I'm so heavily into that sort of stuff it was definitely something I was going to see and believe, I walked out of the cinema smiling because I felt really happy and cheerful and I knew it was because of that movie.
However, you can still feel the fantasy of it.
He still had the anime look with big eyes yet the other characters looked like generic cgi characters.
Didn't get the point when President is still speaking of reelection after being absorbed by a giant robot destroying city.
The Tenma portrayed in this new movie version is a more positive version, as he is still bound by love for his creation, Astro Boy.
Granted I'm not a fan of Astro Boy, but I still enjoyed this film.
I watched it in a cinema 13 years ago and can still remember the exact mood of that evening.
there is still half a billion people on planet hearth who don't have enough to eat and a few people filling their pockets.
He can still bite, the old pit-bull.
The relentlessly grim tone doesn't make for a top viewing experience then, but this is still a relevant and interesting story that serves as great food for thought.
While it is a noble effort and some effort has been made to highlight the plight of such immigrants, it is still just a snapshot of a much more knotty problem Â a problem that we are all, to some extent, responsible for.
it still was entertaining.
By the way, a vast majority of ignorant Russians are still offended by the notion of him being a homosexual.
Otherwise, Lenin still wins his micro battle in your consciousness, and the bastard doesn't deserve this, and you neither.
I still catch myself saying "Ah nut bunnies!"
I still can't take Brad Pitt seriously, but Kevin Spacey has surely deserved his place among the screen's worst baddies.
Combine that with Fincher's knack for turning even the most mundane scene into a nailbiter Â `Se7en' features a scene with Somerset and Mills standing together in an empty field, and yet the scene is still incredibly tense Â and `Se7en' becomes an exceptionally powerful, disturbing film that's difficult to turn away from.
but still lying somewhere beneath that attitude is hope, and that small glimmer of hope, along with the wisdom of experience, is what prevents `Se7en' from spiraling into complete despair.
We still see it copied in movies and TV-series today.
A lot of the gags are played a little too broadly but are still fun.
It's hard to understand how this change from paying for software to free software happened; for many people not involved in the process, it's still news to them.
But while Somerset still cares about his fellow human beings, Doe hates them, and takes out his rage in a series of gruesome murders based on the seven deadly sins.
At a mere 77 minutes, this delicious serving of pure hilarious cynicism still seems a bit long while you're watching it -- maybe because the writers at times invest too much in milking all they can from certain scenes.
I've just seen it again and it's still not funny.
After the movie was over I was still "playing" these lines in my head and laughing.
Nothing made me roll on the floor, but still cute.
One of the first movies filmed in Technicolor, it still looks pretty good though there is subtle graininess and typical for a film of this age, a constant popping noise exists in the background.
Not as good as "My Man Godfrey" nor as funny as "Bringing Up Baby", "Nothing Sacred" is still great entertainment and a rare opportunity to see the luminous Lombard at full star wattage.
Even today we still hunger for our celebrities some of whom are nothing but professional celebrities.
The color is pretty good for 1937, and you'll see the Wicked Witch of the East portraying her less wicked, but still spiteful self.
Coming in at a breezy 75 minutes, "Nothing Sacred" is still very funny on several levels, for several different reasons.
Even though I knew it was his first--and therefore probably cheesy--I still hoped for something of value.
There were two saving graces: if you're in the mood for a blast from the past, the ultra-hip 70's feel is totally groovy, man; and if you still happen to have a dusty bag of grass in a drawer somewhere, this is the movie for which to bring it out.
While dated, "Shivers" still packs a punch by daring to show the loves that dare not speak their names.
Also, still beautiful Barbara Steele (as Betts) takes a bath; and, later, engages Susan Petrie (as Janine Tudor) in a seductive Lesbian kiss.
Not peak Cronenberg, but still worthwhile and engrossing all the same.
Though the low-budget is pretty obvious and some things about it are dated, (this WAS over thirty years ago, after all), Cronenberg still stages some scenes of horror here that will have you open-mouthed with shock and surprise.
The result isn't as polished as his later films, with less considered direction and weak performances from some members of the cast, but the film still manages to impress thanks to Cronenberg's innovative story, some impressive make-up FX (by Joe Blasco) and a few very memorable scenes.
Although Shivers might not 'wow' today's audiences with dazzling special effects and technical brilliance, there are still plenty of unsettling scenes that make this movie worth a look, especially if you're a fan of the director's later work: an early death scene sees a man strangling a young woman, before cutting her open and pouring acid into her body cavity; Betts (Barbara Steele) gets a bath-time shock as one naughty, phallic parasite pops out of the plughole and nips up her cooch; Nicholas Tudor (Allan Kolman) wishes he hadn't been getting some on the sly when his stomach begins undulating in a rather uneasy fashion; and a brilliant, downbeat ending sees the horny islanders getting into their cars for a trip to the mainland.
Nearly 15 years after her best role in "Black Sunday" she still is the yummiest witch queen of B-cinema!
Cronenberg may have been learning as he went along, making this film and its follow-up, "Rabid", and it's obviously not as polished as his subsequent works, but it's still very respectable, showing early on that he had a definite aptitude for this medium.
SHIVERS is not nearly as memorable as some of Cronenburg's other works (VIDEODROME, THE FLY or my personal favorite - THE BROOD...) but it is still worth a look for anyone that is into Cronenburg's strange cinema.
Again, not the best of his films by any means, but still solid.
In this respect, the film doesn't "preach" any special meaning even though the film's moral statements are still maintained.
It still amazes me how much music adds to a scene.
I still think Darell should have come back again....but then again I am Bias...  Dean N. Arevalo(Darell)
I completely understand this movie has a low rating here, but still I give it a 10 out of 10!
Being a glutton for punishment (apparently) I still find myself sitting down to watch Asylum movies from time to time.
They could have put in 100 more zombies, and this movie would still suck.
Although Byrum Werner (maybe the coolest name for an exploitation director, I'll admit) probably hasn't done a Faith Hill video, the comparison can still apply.
This movie was so painful that I had to watch it in four separate sittings and still suffered all the way through it.
The struggles of previous generations (the first two stories in the film) are still common in way too many places, even if substantial progress has been made in the West Coast, Mid-Atlantic, New England and Iowa (who would have guessed a gay person would have more rights in the heartland than in California?
Even though I know my emotional buttons are being pushed, I still enjoy every word and aspect of this film.
And that movie still had its "Hollywood-ish" elements in the home scenes with Don Taylor's detective.
Even with some very slow bits in this film, I still have to say it is my second favorite film by Kurosawa (after Seven Samurai, of course).
However, unlike Kurosawa's greater films (Dodes'ka-den and Rashomon), Stray Dog still feels like a young man's work.
The director Alex van Warmerdam is known in Holland for his film "Abel", a comedy about a man who refused to grow up and who still lives with his parents, at the age of 26.
Kurosawa's kinetic approach to shot composition is really starting to shine through here, with whirring desk fans, spinning arcade games and billowing net curtains keeping moving elements in the frame even when the actors are still.
But it is still a truly great film, it deserves to rank up there with the best noir movies from America and France.
This may not be quite as accomplished as his later 'High and Low', but it is still a terrific thriller that puts the vast majority of modern movies to shame.
Compared to later entries in his filmography Stray Dog appears to be a minor entry, but it's still well worth the time to discover.
Obviously, Kurosawa as the director calls the shots in terms of the visuals, his true forte, though this is him still in a young director mode, very confident in his style, though only giving minor fluoride's of style (sometimes quite well).
I bought this DVD because I mistakenly thought that the premise had some interesting mystery/suspense possibilities, that the attractive, well-recognized cast would deliver entertaining performances, and that, even if the plot and acting failed, there still might be enough to make the film one of those movies that is fun to watch because of how bad it is.
I haven't seen it since I was a kid but the memory of that climactic collective murder still makes me wince.
As others have said.....This movie stays with you....I was 10.. probably younger..when I saw it....and I can still recall the feeling in my stomach and aching in my heart.
The third didn't really effect me as much as the others but it still held it's place.
Alejandro's language is made of cold lights, cameras never standing still, zooming and moving like it was a video reporter filming a battle.
I've seen the film about five times and I am still touched by her performance.
This B-movie spaghetti war film takes us to a still mostly NAZI-occupied France in World War II where a handful of American soldiers are on their way to the nearest military prison (or noose) for a variety of crimes via a truck convoy.
The cinematography and production values put the film a few steps ahead of much of the spaghetti war film genre but everything is still very cheap, looking and feeling like the film was made in 1968 as opposed to its actual 1978 release.
Anyway, the tagline sez "Whatever the Dirty Dozen did, they did it dirtier" is true to the point that these guys have a lot more fun and a lot less issue with what they're doing, but I still find the ending to the Dirty Dozen to be extremely morally defunct, whereas the excited escapism of this movie doesn't really serve towards such a dark ending.
Of course "Bastards" was also part and well, I will be trying to see all of those films now not before but after Tarantino's "Basterds" and yes, I'm still a newcomer in regards of war pictures and yes if not for QT I probably would have never seen this film, hell anyways it would have never been released on DVD or Blu-Ray (the 3-disc edition contains a really great conversation with QT and Castellari).
The Italian industry from the 50's to the late 70's thrived by imitating big Hollywood box office hits and even though The Inglorious Bastards came a good 10 years after the WWII action cycle of the 60's, it's still a welcome addition to the genre.
Acting and plot is not the greatest in history, but it's still a very exiting film.
Bo Svenson, himself a renegade, still tries to do the decent job as an officer and keep these boys in line.
The creature costume is mildly amusing (with some parts of it having developed more cat-like features and others still human).
But the most important thing still is that I forgot I'd already seen it.
And 77 years later, the Guardsman still brings laughs to us.
I still don't quite understand the ending of this film.
And Norman Lloyd as roguish nephew, he's a veteran player still acting , who joined the original company of Orson Welles-John Houseman Mercury Theatre and after that he was hired to Hollywood to play as secondary actor in Alfred Hitchcock movie and other ones and made him an associate producer.
But for all the earnest concern, there's still too much of the theatrical for my liking.
As of this writing, he's 93 and still working.
But there are still hardships ahead, including a severe storm that destroys all the crops, serving to emphasize the man against nature theme of the entire story.
Renoir was still a master and had definitely not lost his touch when he made this saga about a year in the life of a desperately poor farming family trying to make it.
In todays world the ethnicity is still a root persecution that leads to a lot of violence.
Good to know that big corporations are still trying to mold our opinion with subtle physiological conditioning in our movies, television and magazines.
* Male chauvinism - Austria still is a very conservative society when it comes to roles of males and females and who "has the pants on".
Nonetheless, I was still captivated, and will gladly watch it again.
When she meets Tasha, we are allowed to see her caring and compassionate side in reaching out for those less fortunate still.
Alternating between stony silence and lashing out in bigoted epithets at "Gypos" whom he feels (incorrectly) take his jobs, McGann portrays a total bastard with whom one may still feel some sympathy.
The film does try to create a romance between Melvin and the waitress which is OK but gets a bit overlong (the restaurant scene is a bit lengthy), but still highly recommended  Great feel good film.
Second viewing was somewhat bored but still liked it.
I still feel like "You can't handle the truth!"
Now, I probably wouldn't want to personally know a man like Melvin in my real life, but I still found those cracks to be hysterically funny.
The acting ranged from quite good to ham, and although I wished the scarecrow didn't talk it was still a pretty creepy-looking horror villain.
Night of the Scarecrow deserves more recognition then it gets.It's got a good storyline and plot to it.Theres no characters that are that famous,but if you watch soap opears you'll recognize Cristi Harris who plays "Stephanie".She's from NBCs Sunset Beach.The killer Scarecrow is corny ,like the snowman in Jack Frost,but it's still a great movie.It also has great death scenes;so if you like horror movies rent Night of the Scarecrow,you won't be disappointed.I give it **** out of ***** stars.
Not many people have heard of this, but still give it a go because it is much better then some of the other horror movies out there.
Chronologically, I'm definitely not a 'kid' any more, and wasn't when I first watched this excellent series either, but I still couldn't resist its charms, and thankfully, had the foresight to record most of the episodes.
Sure the overall arc of the story may have been predictable, but there were still plenty of dramatic moments along the way and you enjoyed the ride.
Lewis says, but he is still right about Aslan.
In the Beavers' dam scene, Edmund is shown to look at the hills, still quite a ways a way.
But I screened it recently, and the film still leaves me cold, despite the best of intentions, the flawless direction and the great production values.
The green-screen use is laughable: for example, when standing on a hilltop, next to an animal whose fur is blowing in the wind, we see a too-close shot of the children, whose improperly-lit hair is standing PERFECTLY still... on a hilltop.
I feel that nothing important was omitted and the parts that were adjusted in the script were done so well that it still could have passed for C.S.
Scott Baio was and still is a third rate Steve Guttenburg.
Director/co-writer Robert J. Rosenthal relates the amusingly silly story at a constant snappy pace, does a solid job of maintaining a light and breezy tone throughout, and tosses in an entertainingly nonstop barrage of admittedly dumb, but still funny lowbrow humor.
Scott Baio was and still is a great actor.
Fosse, known for his choreography which is still being used in films like Chicago years after his death only directed five theatrical films and three of those were musicals in Sweet Charity, Caberet and All That Jazz so Lenny would be the first of only two non-musicals he would direct, both biographies, Lenny and Star 80.
I kind of liked the movie because it still has a story to tell despite bad directing and low budget.
He still wants credit for his findings, but it brings a whole host of bad people into the mix.
I'm still looking for a film that really allows her to strut her stuff ("The Thin Man" is the closest I've come to finding one).
I enjoy watching Cary Grant may a fool of himself, he will do what it takes to make a movie funny, but the star of this movie is Myrna Loy, she was in her forties, but she look like she was only in her thirties, and still sexy.
Through most of this film Grant has little scope for his physical comedy (especially as compared to Bringing Up Baby or Monkey Business) which is why the picnic sequence really shines, but his facial expressions and voice make the most of the limited possibilities, especially in the nightclub scene where there is a lot going on in a small space and Cary Grant still shines.
That said, THE BACHELOR & THE BOBBY-SOXER is still definitely a film that's well worth the watch...
I am eager to hear more, to listen to his words, and be intrigued by how his thoughts are still relevant in today's society.
Not so much because of the shock value that surrounded them, but just how relevant his work is still today.
As homosexuality becomes a staple in our community and society, Lenny's comments on the teachers in this film seemed like topics we are still talking about today.
Under the direction of Irving Reis, this comedy is still fun to watch after all these years.
It's a little lesser known as many of these actors other films always overshadow it, but it is still a good example of 1940s film making, with top talent at its best.
Perhaps the most telling scene has Thomas, hands still bruised from "business" dealings, tapping out classical piano chords on a bar, while electronic music blares out in the background and his thuggish partners discuss how they are going to drive their next deal home.
Magnificent stuff and proof that European cinema is still light-years ahead of Hollywood in terms of films that actually mean anything.
He seems to relish the jobs he is asked to do but still dreams of becoming a concert pianist.
But he's 28 and, though he still noodles around on his piano at home, he hasn't practiced seriously for 10 years.
The Beat that My Heart Skipped carefully pushes all the right buttons, but still seems fresh given French naturalistic acting, an unpredictable storyline, great soundtrack, and being entertaining and funny.
two days after watching the film i am still pondering what was meant by the glance at the end, what kind of emotions tom must have & why he does not kill the Russian guy.
The character is still a boy learning to play his life.
i mean, i know the french are blasÃ©, but they still don't like late arrivals.
Based on a flop more admired in France than the US, James Toback's 70's Harvey Keitel vehicle about a violent would-be pianist, "Fingers," this compulsively watchable, thrillingly accomplished new movie by Jacques Audiard ("De Battre mon cÂur s'est arrÃªtÃ©", still showing in Paris as it opens here) echoes his previous compellingly offbeat "Read My Lips" in grafting together two separate moral universes.
I'm still wait for "The Third Twin" from novelist, Ken Follettt, "Sole Survivor" from novelist, Dean Koontz.
This is a pretty good Western, from an expert in the field (Hathaway) â immeasurably aided by its star cast (Gary Cooper, Susan Hayward, Richard Widmark, Hugh Marlowe and Cameron Mitchell), a compelling plot line (three adventurers help a woman save her husband, trapped in a mine, then fight over her and the coupleâs gold), the pleasant Widescreen photography (the format was still a new fad at the time), and a magnificent score (courtesy of the great Bernard Herrmann).
They arrive at the mine with husband and Apaches still there.
When the group arrives at what the Indians call the Garden of Evil, a sacred grounds atop a high mountain where the mine is located, they found Fuller (Hugh Marlowe) still alive, but embittered and with a broken leg...
This was her second movie with Gary Cooper since her appearance in William A. Wellman's superb, high adventure 'Beau Geste,' and her third with director Hathaway...  Richard Widmark proceeds his ways of gambling with a neat line in cynical cracks; Cameron Mitchell fails in his unwelcome sexual advances; Hugh Marlowe uses a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with his angry feelings; Victor Manuel Mendoza gets intensely angry after being hit; and Rita Moreno delights the environment with her sweet voice...  Hathaway was one of the great Hollywood veterans still in harness, a versatile director whose Westerns have been as variable in quality as his other films... Filmed on location in Mexico, his 'Garden of Evil' is a beautiful spectacle to behold...
Shortly thereafter, the couple returns to the USA and Roger starts publishing a brand new newspaper in a small country town but they still find something sorely lacking in their lives and ultimately decide what they need is to adopt a child which presents many unexpected challenges and hurdles by no means easy to overcome.
However, I still prefer her dramatic performances in "I Remember Mama" and "Anna and the King of Siam".
They decide they still want a child so they adopt.
A stirring speech by Grant (and the faith of the kind adoption lady) convinces said honchos that Grant and Dunne are still good parents and that their child will never starve.
I loved it then and I still love it today.
Very anti-climactic, ambiguous rationalizing- and a still shot of space.
One of the weaker entries in the Drummond series, but it's still entertaining.
After 65 years, this film still rings true in many ways.
Mind you, Irene Dunne is lying on top of the cover with her dressing gown on, tensely waiting for the baby's next feeding, while Cary Grant is off to sleep, but I still wonder how it got past the Hays office.
Today it seems films addressing these issues are still underexposed and maligned at times, the message is important and this film should be recommended in schools.
She was beautiful in the movie and once I saw the real Gwen I still thought the same thing she was beautiful as both a girl and guy both on the inside and out.
Schultz wants to leave more than anything, because he's in an abusive home, but Matt still doesn't want to fully make up his mind.
I loved it when I first saw it and I still enjoy it.
I first saw it in 70mm in a cinema re-release in 1995, and still remember that night as one of the most transcendental cinema experiences of my life.
I suppose Jeff Goldblum had to take what he could get in those days, but it's still disappointing to have to sit through his gags (literally).
I would and still do highly recommend this movie to anyone.  
the cut-aways to the aborigines during Glenn's flight up in space) still carry some worth as far as being filmed wonderfully or with a strange quality that makes it fun to watch - any other director might take out the crucial detail of Alan Shepard urinating in his suit before the very first successful launch of a US man into space, but it's left in, and stronger for it.
Yeager in contrast doesn't win the flight record at the film's end, but he is still the hero.
there didn't seem to be any real threat but it was still pretty solid.
I really didn't expect an anime to produce *the* most depressing ending ever and I was totally not prepared to witness it but i am still glad I saw the movie.
But it still got to me, which is a credit to the film.
The movie was still great, but could have been enhanced with a more detailed storyline.
The laughter of the small girl still haunts me and I'd love to watch this film again and again
Also like Ozu especially, this movie utilizes many still shots, especially in key scenes where the emotions are at its unprecedented peaks for an animation film.
It's painful to watch but still you have to see it...
The moment where the ghostly Seita takes the ghostly Setsuko's hand and nods to her is not only a happy moment, it signifies that the suffering - which is yet to come, as far as the viewer is concerned - is over, and they are together again (albeit still without parents).
He still believes that Japan will win the war he thinks it's up to him to take care of his sister with their mother gone and father who knows where.
However, despite some interesting facets, the stench of "Sci-Fi Channel Original" still has managed to permeate this show.
A time of youth and innocence when the realities of life were still on the distant horizon.
I first heard about "Cha Fa Nui" (Camille) from the mouth of my mother when I was still an upper primary school girl.
(So, until now I still don't understand how come the man at one row before me could be sleeping and snoring so annoyingly while his girlfriend/wife/sister was staring hard on the screen without moving her head.)
And the most excruciating of all, I can still feel the deafening horror that the deserted and seriously ill Violetta was standing desertedly in the cruelly empty and stripped big house, letting out piercing shriek of pain.
Their love for each other is torn apart by his father--but she still loves him.
When I walked in the screen was covered by a red curtain (back in those days some of the older theaters still had curtains).
That can't be recreated at your home but this film is still well worth seeing.
And Zeffirelli here is still at the stage designing grand opera productions around the world, while still in his creative prime as a film maker.
Someone should put pressure on Universal (who is still selling the same 16 year old video) to restore this gem, and re-release it on video and DVD.
I just bought another VHS, and was disappointed it was still the original version.
"Stolen" is the rare film that allows us to linger in the still silence of the museum.
As viewers, we feel as though we are truly standing in front of "The Music Lesson," observing the intricately crafted world in the frame and contemplating how the work, so many years later, still connects us to its mysterious creator.
If I had seen this film before reading the book first, I still would not have liked it very much.
It is a testament to this film's lasting power which, unfortunately, remains limited only to Serbian filmgoers since an English-dubbed DVD is still nowhere in sight.
The strangler is the overweight, middle-aged Pera Mitic (Tasko Nacic), still living with his mother and earning a meagre living by selling carnations.
The laughs are still there, but they take on a slightly nervous quality.
In Universal's film, Hattie McDaniel plays with less dignity, but still shows some anger when the white man demands return of his jewelry.
I'm still amazed how this absolutely horrible thing gets so many accolades from people.
But still, this version really wasn't so bad taken just by itself.
Even if Ava Gardner is sexier than anyone intended Julie to be, she is still great and truly heartbreaking in the later sequences.
"Ol' Man River" is still extremely powerful and moving, even if the man singing it has a non-existent role in the proceedings, even if he isn't Paul Robeson, and even if it's missing parts.
He still finds time to squeeze a drop of enjoyment from his difficult life, though, and there is a stunning sequence where the boy and his friends race to the horizon where flaming oil fires incinerate the sky.
This film still remains as my personal favourite.
Matt is still simple and unpretentious but Cora is determined to crash New York's "Society 400" list.
Instead of her usual scatterbrain adventures she plays a self-absorbed social climber, but still manages to infuse the role with her usual comic touches.
This film is different it is obvious that not that much money has been spent on it, yet it still manages to truly scare(for many days).
Then we get to the negative points, beginning with mostly indifferent or awful acting, slow pacing, especially in the first thirty minutes, and an atrociously rewritten script, which keeps the basic plot line,but throws out most of Hammerstein's dialogue to make way for some memorably corny lines ("There's still not enough room on this boat for the two of us!").
When you don't Hav Plenty of money, the one thing you can still do is write a good story.
Lena had, and still has, a wonderful voice and would have been wonderful in the part vocally.
I saw Hav Plenty when it was first released back in 1997 and i still feel about it today the same as i did when i left out of the theater back in '97.
It was just too weak to even be so bad it was still funny.
And Marge Champion is the only one of the stars from this film that is still alive today at age 90.
But that was what set the tone, and this still was fun to view.
He has such a rubbery face, and I can still hear him saying "Happy New Year".
CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN is actually the first Sam Katzman-produced horror film I've checked out Â and it's one of four that were recently packaged together in Columbia's ongoing "Icons Of Horror" series of genre Box Sets; a second, THE GIANT CLAW (1957), followed this straight awayÂand, even if I wasn't exactly enthused with either of them, I'd still like to catch up with the remaining two titles (namely THE WEREWOLF [1956] and ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU [1957]).
Mostly as a filler for the time after the local news and the start of prime time.as a kid and as an adult i have always look forward to the old movies and this is one good flick for its time.I am trying to find this on DVD and would appreciate if some one who reads will help me find it although it will probably pretty tough.When Tris movie was on the TV i would always make an effort to see it.Although seemly laughable i still think it is a worthwhile investment for what is still a good scare.When the zombies come out to do battle with the police is still a shocker even by todays standards
I loved Darkwing Duck when I was 5 years old and I still love it now!
Twelve years later, after finding some taped episodes, I am still in love with this wonderful show and glad to see there are lots of devoted fans out and about.
Darkwing Duck still has loads going for it, including a brilliant theme song and his memorable signature catchphrase 'Let's get dangerous' (or 'It's gonna get scary big-time' as they say in France).
There still life in this bird yet and with the Scrooge McDuck universe still popular to this day then we might just see him return some time.
BuÃ±uel still has yet not to surprise me.
I can't believe that Bunuel was able to create such vividly bizarre sequences that laugh in the face of conventions, and still manage to contain all those random sequences in one film that kept my interest for an hour and forty five minutes.
Though the scenes are quite bizarre, they still manage to feel "right."
Bunuel still lived nine more years after his "Phantom", Pasolini was killed shortly after the postproduction of "Salo".
Pasolini was radical and consistent, Bunuel still had kept his sense of humor (the "Phantom" ranges under "comedy", at least officially).
It could've gone anywhere and introduced me to any character - it still would've been enormously interesting because it was made by the master who had never lost his curiosity, his inquisitive mind, his memory that consisted of the strange and amazing images, his sense of humor, his childhood dreams, his fantasies, dark and shining and who was able to throw them all on the screen like no one ever was able or will be able to do.
I think Bunuel wants to show that complete freedom is impossible because even if you are willing to detach from everybody and everything, you still have your own inner-nature to answer to.
If you like 1930's Hollywood romantic comedy then this is a sweet, unassuming film, which, while not as memorable as many other films of Hollywood's golden age, is still worth a look.
This movie still has camp value.
Wayne, of course, take a role he is perfectly cast for, and makes it better still.
Now if all this doesn't make sense, you need to understand that although Wayne had made many films by 1942, most were B-movies and he still was only just becoming the break-out star he would so clearly be in just a few short years.
Wayne is the one still standing (barely) at fight's end, and Dietrich is his proud (and willing) prize!
When the first version was made the Emperor Franz Josef was still on the throne in Austria.
She gets better as the film goes on, but she's still got a bit of a way to go if she wants to latch on to the Hollywood way of doing things.
Finally, Ramon Novarro still remains the principle reason to watch most of his MGM sound films.
And still a very good movie.
Beware, even though I saw this on USA cable network edited, it is still a pretty violent flick w/ suggested sex & f-bombs ( I could tell what they just said even though it was bleeped out on regular T.V.)
Not that CeauÅescu's will benefit directly from this, but still ...
If you're not from Bucharest but still want to see how they used the place watch it.
She was cute then, and she's still a very pretty woman.....and a good actress.
I can't believe the 87-year-old still is acting.
It's great to see the creators still know how to have some fun with these characters...especially the interplay between Brass and Doc Robbins.
It allows both the writers and the actors some freedom from having to continue to answer questions from previous episodes, while still allowing consistent character development.
I was still at school and found it curiously absorbing.
Our story takes place in the present of the whites and reds, when their rivalry is still alive.
Of course the old mythology is still present and with some flashbacks we are going to see how this two clans ends in the same town that now is almost abandoned and is controlled by the two clans.
I only hope it still exists?
I'm not entirely sure I understood the plot of Sukiyaki Western Django, mainly because I couldn't understand the dialogue very well, but I still can say it's unlike anything I have ever seen.
Sukiyaki Western Django is very dialogue heavy, but it still packs a lot of action and a lot more character deaths than is standard for this type of film.
It comes very close to being too top-heavy with aesthetic for its own good, but, for me, it was still very entertaining and awing.
Having the Japanese cast speak in broken-down English does sort of lessen the experience not by much comparing to some of the horrendous English dubs in some Italian Westerns but still it would have been preferable using a Japanese language track with an optional English one.
The creative script is intelligent enough to keep the attention of adults while still entertaining children.
They will probably still find some joy in it.
The folks are able to learn that she believed they were attacked--but by what they still don't know.
While they still don't know what happened, an 'expert' announces that one of the victims was impaled with a Phoenician sword associated with funerals and Baal worship and they MUST search the island for treasure.
The mass murderer might still be on the island waiting but they don't even consider the possibility or bring weapons or a cop!!!
I met year two years ago and she is still stunning and amazing.
She is saucy and sexy, in this film, that pre-dates "Friday the 13th" but still has some of the same scares.
Fortunately its gets shown uncut on television and though it doesn't have any spectacular content, its still pretty toothsome stuff.
Well, basically I was still in grade school and didn't care for anything that wasn't loaded with action or comedy.
It's something of an easy sell, I suppose, but I'm still left admiring how it's packaged.
I realize he did it because Steve McQueen was originally supposed to be in it--but that's still a stupid reason.
However, its soundtrack is still one of the best soundtracks to date.
But even with the soundtrack, it still rounds out to a disappointing 2 out of 10.
Most movies age, but in 2009 it still felt contemporary.
(He was still warming up for the upcoming sarcastic remarks.)
Uhura: "What are the chances the Captain and the others are still alive?"
The men's antics are a tad predictable, but they are still hilarious, like the episode with Compo dressing up as the ice cream man, with a duck-caller.
The newer episodes are good, but it's not the same without those lovable characters, because Peter Sallis I think is the only one of them still alive, and over the years is subdued to cameo appearances.
All in all, a hugely satisfying comedy series, that still looks good after 30+ years thanks to the amazing countryside scenery.
it's not as good as resident evil but it's still a 10 i did not even get scared when it came on sci channel last week long advertisement though but it was still awesome though that was the best movie i saw that had zombies cause it had a lot of light and the dude who wrote it if your on here good job dude.Shaun of the dead was good to.la.la.la.Ad.Ad.Ad.brass monkey junkie that monkey monkey.
The quality of the show might not be what it once was, but its still more enjoyable than the dire 'Little Britain'.
At almost ninety years old, she is still beautiful, sweet, and brilliant in her role as Edie.
I am sad about Bill Owen's death but the show still manages to go on with his son.
I still get letters and cards from fans despite leaving the show in 1988.
That out of the way, I still enjoyed this movie.
Every now and then an avid movie theater goer is bound to stumble upon something like this, but it still took be by surprise.
I guess it reminded a lot of viewers about the whole "Wild Orchid"/"Showgirls" fiasco which is still etched in the mind's-eye of every self-conscious moviegoer.
It would still be a few years before the director could get back into full stride but this this film must have ensured that he would be able to continue making films, even if temporarily, it was still to be in Mexico.
My friends and I still quote lines from it and we still get together and watch it when we have our zombie movie get togethers.
The older, Mathilde (Elsa Zylberstein), is a wife and mother residing in a modern, developed country, but still living under marital rules and customs brought from her native Tunisia.
The reasons being that the story-line though thin, still manages to interest audiences due to its simple story-telling coupled with great visuals and music !
then when they hit land, for some reason they dress up as hobo's while they're still carrying around M4's and Ak's, while trying to be under cover.This is soon followed by the Rangers wandering around the streets taking they're hobo-taskic costumes off, after they only had them on for about 3 minutes, you can't blame them, this film is such a steaming pile of crap I would've refused to dress like a jack-ass.
I'm so happy to see that he's still got it in him.
I saw "The Aviator" a couple of days ago and while I still have Howard Hughes flying through my brain I felt the need to see again another Scorsese.
But still remember it.
Of course it's a TV-movie clichÃ©, but it was still fun to watch, just like this whole movie is.
I guess it added some doubt and some twists, but I think the movie still would've played fine without it.
Now the tribe still has a witch doctor AND they live in primitive huts, but somehow the girl has managed to go off to college in the US and is a lab tech!!
Even though that wasn't one of A&C's best it still was miles above this grade Z shlock.
Corman would have made an exploitation film that viewers would still be talking about today and it would have been full of nudity and graphic events but alas, Lieberman instead directed a film that is completely forgettable.
It's a pretty cool (but strange) film that even with the poor acting was still entertaining.
Yes, I know it is a Sci-Fi film, but there are still too many holes in the plot.
I'd still recommend this movie for its train wreck factor, just don't put your hopes up high before you watch it.
I'm still left scratching my head wondering why was there such a huge typo in the English movie title.
women getting physically restrained and then usually abused in various ways) this can be viewed as a kind of "missing link" between the Irving Klaw/Bettie Page classics of the early to mid 1950's and the gems from House of Milan/TAO in the 1970's and 1980's (the latter still being regarded by yours truly as the exemplar of the genre).
Late in the going we see Olga let her hair down and start to undress as she gets ready for bed; unfortunately no auto-eroticism ensues (well it was still 1964 and all that).
The girl was still breathing.
Despite the comedy scenes, he is still good in the emotional scenes.
Even when I heard all the deadly reviews, I still wanted to buy it.
After more than 25 years since they released their first album, they are still going strong!
The writing and acting still hold up.
Assuming that the tapes do exist still, I would expect the demand is enough now to justify its release on DVD.
I can still hear the tune.
The story isn't brilliant and the acting is weak, but it still manages to keep you laughing with its originality.
And I am still waiting to see "that show" and "that acceptance" in which female executives and CEO's run the country ...
If I had as much money as they do, I'd still have to find some time to do some stuff not for profit... but for fun -- that's how you keep your goals in check and not purely based on how much money your next gig pays... keeps you straight, in line with your actual creative goals.
Today, Cagney is still a household name, while William has unfortunately been forgotten, the victim of an A-picture career that peaked during the forbidden pre-Code era that never turned up on popular TV.
I don't think I've seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it.
Please someone must have really liked this show as much as I still do?
this film came out in 1950 & 57 years later the son still sounds sore.
However, after working with the florist for four years, he still can't get a raise.
Though released, the detective in charge (Robert Keith) is still suspicious of him.
Yet, in spite of its seriousness, it was still basically a comedy that made me laugh out loud repeatedly.
An easy way to try to create a nice (which nice is totally not in this case) humor about the natural racial preventions which every race still fill in front of other races (unfortunately).
The trailers on TV were excellent and Bernie Mac is an great comedic actor but about half way thru I was getting so agitated and could not sit still.
I cried when I realized the stars of this movie are still employed.
That scene shows that both sides can be racist in their own rights but still enjoy a good joke when it is truly funny.
Ashton Kutcher is an underrated comedic actor, who despite his good looks, can still be quite goofy and amusing.
Even though the movie is corny, it still sends a message that love will prevail.
Even though there are a lot of differences between "Guess Who" and "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner", I still see a resemblance.
Ivan Sandomire's performance, the music, and some externals (including the B&W still pictures) are good, but not strong enough to save the film.
It's not worth making a great effort to seek out the movie, but it's still worth seeing.
Of course they are all still trying to work out why they have been brought here, as there is no indication why but they figure it must have something to do with Rassilons tomb, which lies in the tower.
It's great to see all the old Doctors, for example (even if the first Doctor was dead and is played here by a lookalike and the fourth Doctor rather childishly didn't want to be in the show, so is featured via old, unused TV footage), but it's still a bit cheesy to have simply SO MUCH Doctor Who crammed into one show.
However you look at it, notwithstanding, the film still pulls through successfully.
One can't help but think this could have been so immensely better with a different director, yet it is still surprising that it was carried under his wing.
So even if the movie isn't without its flaw, it's still ultimately uplifting, and a welcome addition to a growing list of movies purport to examine social, cultural and political aspects of the city-state, from "12 Storeys" to "Eating Air" to "Chicken Rice War".
But considering how marvelously done the flying sequences are (exceptional for the time), the consistency of the writing and acting and the overall fun of the film, I think the average person would still probably give this movie a score of 6.
Even workhorse Charles Lane, who is today 101 and says he is still available to do a show, is seen briefly on the tube in a man-on-the-street interview.
She may be elderly but she can still belt the cat with the best of them!
Sylvester is his crafty and rambunctious self, and Tweety is still cute.
(Actually, I only wasted about an hour and 15 minutes, since I fast forwarded through everything that didn't have subtitles...and I was still bored.)
I can't believe this still has an X--I've seen more explicit R rated films.
Now years on and I still love it.
There still aren't that many films in this niche between porn and mainstream.
With its glossy sheen, EMMANUELLE can't help seeming a lot more hypocritical than its many imitators, and yet I still like the movie an awful lot.
no wonder it has been shown in french cinema for 10 years and still shown in film festivals.
It is no longer the shocker that it was in 1974, and anyway I have never been able to watch the 105' French version... so this film has also been a kind of Holy Grail to me, and I am still hoping to watch the full original.
I'm surprised that Emmanuelle still has a notorious reputation, as it's only soft-core at best; but it's definitely worth seeing, if only to see how much things have changed!
Even the music is first class and still does the rounds on its own.
Nevertheless, there are still scenes that seem shocking even thirty years on.
She treats him like s h i t, her "friends" treat him like s h i t, yet - for reasons known only to screenwriter, director and pretentious tw*t extraordinaire Christophe Honore - he still hangs out with them all.
Among my favourite examples of how self-consciously foulsome this dollop is, are the scene where one of Mere's friends sticks her finger up Garrel's arse and then Mummy dutifully sniffs it, and the scene where Emma de Caunes sticks her hand up her "still dripping" womanhood and wipes it onto Garrel's chest.
Garrel is treated like crap but still loves (yes, loves) his mother.
I know the French New Wave threw the book out of the window, but surely some of the rules still stand?
Although not one of Grisham's best, he still deserves credit for daringly going into a dark and despised part of American history.
But still it was not bad.
But still, it's still worth while watching.
It's still an entertaining film, and they forget the value of that.
(A lot of stations must still be exhibiting these films, which usually have "Movietime USA Presents" title cards replacing the RKO Radio Pictures traditional opening with the Trade Mark broadcasting Radio Tower.)
Anderson (still think he was robbed) and because I always enjoy seeing J. Statham beat up on people-heh.
The actors give the performances they need to give, while still having fun with their roles.
Otherwise, catch this one in the theater while you still can!
The assassin is still in the house, to make things even worse, if that's possible.
However, what Jensen finds out is that the man who killed his wife is in there, and he'll do whatever it takes to get back at him while still in there!
Its deliberately trashy, shallow and inept, and for some reason I still like it.
But despite the twists you can see coming a mile away, they're still satisfying.
Society hasn't gotten to the point where we watch snuff films but watching fictional people kill each other is still loads of fun, and so is "Death Race".
I guarantee you you'll still have a much better time that watching something like Capote
Philippe is a perennial student who, at age forty, is still seeking approval for his Doctoral dissertation which argues that man's desire to explore space is built, not on discovering the mystery and wonder of the universe, but on his own narcissism - his act of self-projection.
But the movie wants to show that despite theses lacks, the main character (I forgot the name) is still an original person, with imagination et interesting thoughts.
was a really cool guy, Madsen laid back and Hopper (gettin' kinda' creaky in his way) but still stretching his chops.
But when saying the director wasn't doing hits off of a crack pipe while working is the best compliment to give a movie, that's still pretty bad.
as Kurosawa's High And Low showed the best and worst of Japanese society in the early 60s, this film shows the potential of a country that was newly industrialized, but still coping with the changes of capitalism and being humiliated by world war II.
This movie fits right in; yet still stands out because of the originality, at least in the west, of its story.
Of course this is a Hollywood 7 second treatment of an all day ritual but it was still a fun nod to Thai history.
The action in this feature was definitely entertaining, and the special power aspect gave rising to that of "Kung fu Hustle" while still retaining a realistic point of view.
It shows that there a people that when overworked, still care about their jobs and the people they deal with on a day to day basis.
And it's still amazing how many innocent people are locked away with almost no hope of getting out.
Even though she doesn't always believes in his innocence, she still goes after the real killer.
No, the real tragedy here is that the Louds were really no different from your own friends and family and neighbors, and they still aren't.
A reality that fortunately doesn't exist anymore in the same way in Afghanistan, but in various forms is still practiced in a number of countries.
It is hard to believe that in the modern Muslim world there are still people willing to humiliate and torture women.
If this is how the majority of men still want to indoctrinate their boys in school to behave, then the world will remain a cruel place for woman from Morocco to Indonesia.
I am ashamed that some generally good religious Muslim men in our community still refuse to condemn such outrageous behavior.
That it was made only a year after the Taliban were ousted gives it an authentic documentary feel, but it would still be as effective if the events were years earlier.
Most of the violence is off-screen, but there is still disturbing imagery in this very realistic film.
The repression of the women, the poverty, the young boys being trained for war, the younger girls forced to marry someone they don't want to...they still happens in XXI century.
But other than that, the film is very powerful and although the real magnitude if the suffering in Afghanistan will never be known to its full extent, I still managed to feel empathy for the people I used to be completely indifferent to (I admit to my eternal shame).
It is amazing that such things still exist in today's world.
On a different note possibly more hopeful, though family poverty, hardships of Afghan refugees and girl posing as boy to obtain work are still the ingredients, we have "Baran" 2001, another worthwhile filmic experience from Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi ("Children of Heaven" and "Color of Paradise".)
Although life was hard for them, they still knew how to enjoy themselves.
After enduring what seemed hours of such stagey performances, I was sure that somewhere out in the world, the writer was still hunting down Metropolitan's director, with murder as his sole intent.
"Metropolitan" is like a little piece of jewelry which is beautiful and a bit ornate, and still unpretentious (maybe someone else described it this way too--I don't mean to plagiarize!).
I can say this film has staying power as I've seen it about half a dozen times in the 12 years since it came out; the most recent occasion was a week ago, and it still holds up, like a great play.
She's even below the juvenile/character man (last billed featured player Franklin Pangborn, who's later lavender camp personality is still not locked in stone here, though his comic and dramatic talents are), but when she manages to get a handsome young drifter (little she knows!)
The acting is way all over the top but still works for this kind of movie.
This movie took the right influences and ripped them off in almost a cynical way but still this movie is cheese for the please.
Yes, this is quality here but still is entertaining!
For a movie coming from Peru, I think it was very good, but it cannot stand with international standards: most of the actors were pathetic:) Now, don't understand me wrong, the movie is nice, and I recommend it, BUT is still far away from the Italian neo-realism (It is indeed a neo-realist film..) and WAY far away from the Taxi Driver, that many people compare it with.
Peruvian writer/director Josue Mendez has made a brave little low budget film that deals with a subject currently burgeoning our hospitals in this country as the fallout of the war on Iraq and still plagues the veterans of the Vietnam War - Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (aka Battle Rattle).
Here it is more than seventy years since the film was made, and it still holds up as an entertaining if highly fictional Western based on the life of the sure shot artist and her days with Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show.
While I am a history teacher and my friends and family HATE watching historical films with me because I often find fault with the way movies often handle the facts in a fast and loose manner, I still managed to like this film and kept my mouth shut about its many inaccuracies!
Despite this, I still am not complaining because I liked the film so much plus Miss Oakley is a rather mythic figure already and little impact on history (though she did a lot for women's rights--at least indirectly).
Annie Oakley is a nice film, not as well known as the musical later derived from her life, but still easy to take with good players at their best.
I was tempted to give it a 10, after all, it was made in 1935 and is still good....
He is okay as Richard, and in the second half of the movie he is even good, but he still lacks charisma.
But despite some flaws, this is still an interesting movie.
His screenplay is well-adapted from Alex Gardland's novel, and although it weakens near the end, he still keeps you wrapped up in all the brilliantly confusing plot twists.
70%  Overall: The Beach is an interesting, intriguing and different film, and although it is as times deeply flawed, it is still an immensly powerful and watchable film.
But still a stunning performance in the Beach.\4****star rating/
I didn't even have to pay for it - but I still felt as though I had wasted 2 hours of my life.
The hippie commune, is still a slave to consumerism society, and not the alternative society that it is set out to be.
In other cases he walks away, and still "feels good being in paradise".
It shows that no matter how hard you try to escape all the wrongs in life, and all of your daily annoyances, they'll still be there no matter where you escape to.
Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters.
But Raw is still my favorite brand.
I like Smackdown a lot, but still I think Raw is better by ever way.
I really like Smackdown it is a very entertaining show, but Raw is just still better.
Rather than attempting any realism, Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach, have created an alternate universe where pirates are still attacking ships and the fanciful fish on display are computer animated.
I grew up on the television shows of the late 60's early 70's- you know- same bat time same bat channel stuff- I could handle the weekly cliff hanger, the anticipation for next weeks show, and still function in the world  So as each episode of '24' ended I was completely unprepared for the barrage of cliff hangers I was left with Â at minimum 3, will they kill the candidate, will they kill Jack's family, will they kill, catch or hurt Jack, will they will they- of course there were more issues and more story lines but hey I could only handle the Joker, the Penguin, and Mr.
I would say to myself "after this hour, I gotta go study" at 1 a.m. 5 episodes later, I would still be saying, "Ok ONE MORE hour, and THEN I will study".
Don't get me wrong, the show is still suspenseful as ever, while there are even some interesting non-terrorist related subplots.
Seen it years ago when it came out to rent and again this year on DVD, it is a good film but still in the straight to video bunch of films, some FX are really good for such a film and some are not so hot but it has been done to the best of there budget which has not been much, any weak parts are made up by a good story one i would like to have seen run another 20 mins or more as it seems to end just as its getting in full swing, this is all down to budget mind, if the film had more money, bit more gritty.
Nonetheless, I was still on the edge of my seat and by the end of the year I was left wanting more.
Even though the fourth season was the worst, I was and remain convinced that a bad season of 24 is still better than a good season of any other show.
Update (May 22, 2005): I just finished watching the season finale of season 5 of "24" and despite a few missteps within some seasons, the show is still an exciting thrill ride.
It's like a serious, but still funny version of the A team; "American Idoled up" with adolescent heart throbs from E.R.
At the time when Cousteau's documentaries aired regularly, I was still a child.
Who knows, perhaps a whiff of tar has aphrodisiac properties...  Lewinsky the down-trodden but still spunky assistant/companion to Clay is well played by Roger Coggio.
So, a lot ends up being more fascinating for what is in the subtext this time, even if I still loved looking at Welles's direction, which is always an incredible feat of ingenuity, not to mention here when it's mostly talking heads.
With still some of those same melancholy beats she had when she appeared in French New Wave pictures, she taps into Virgine as someone who's more complex (albeit in small part my plot convenience, oddly enough) than someone like Clay would've thought in his factual-type realm.
And yet the film is, under this surface, recognisably Wellesian - the old man who has amassed great wealth at the expense of an emotional life, who seeks to control others; the use of storytelling as a metaphor; the idea of the author as a repressive God, who makes his characters conform to his will; the subsequent destruction of the author who uses his power to repress, not express, or create, who does not realise that making a story 'real', in the fatuous hope for immortality, can only mean that the author becomes superfluous; the loyal assistant/friend whose life has been emotionally deadened by the need to serve (and suppress moral qualms about) the great man; the tone of the film, nocturnal, quiet, still, cicadas resounding, suffused with sterility and death.
Robert Downy is still up in the air whether I think he is a good actor or not.
And neither is Stone--even now he's still having trouble defending his film.
However, this is one of them movies you can watch several times and still see something new each time.
i still do not know whether it was seeing the entire movie as stone envisioned it, or if it had to do with seeing the nineties play out as a decade obsessed with celebrity, prizing infamy over fame.
Yet, somehow, it was still funny because it was so close to the average sitcom.
Written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Oliver Stone, this controversial film still to this day remains infamous for it's message and the extreme graphic violence.
The movie could still be a brilliant satire of society/the media without going into such graphic detail -- it's been proved in cinema before that sometimes seeing less is better than gratuity.
So yes it does come across as somewhat of a moot point but nevertheless the film is still enjoyable despite its sometimes sickening amount of over-the-top violence (the opening sequence of the Director's Cut is stomach-turning).
After viewing this film many, many times since I first saw it I came to the conclusion that this film basically put on screen my feelings as to why I disliked and still continue to dislike the 90's/Post-Millenium American Pseudo-Culture.
The writers grew up in the 50's and 60's when the paranoia of Cold War was still in their faces everywhere they went.
And then other times still it depends on the energy, desire to entertain and a willingness to admit that there's nothing new under the sun and just crank it all up as loud and as fun as a horror movie can be.
It's all in the tone - fun, of course, but a suspension of belief is still necessary for any movie to work.
The direction and acting could be better but is still not bad.
I felt the stories were properly sequenced, with the weakest link (which still offered a satisfying level of creep) at the beginning and the strongest as the closer.
But even then I still liked both characters, and I think their roles fit them well.
But even then I still liked both characters, and I think their roles fit them well.
"Love on the A Train" is by far the most risquÃ© of the shorts, but it's done in a fashion that still makes it viewable to even the most puritanical of people.
Mercedes Ruehl's character in "Underground" should be proof enough that older women can still be incredibly sexy.
When the film ended, though, it was interesting to note that, while the women in the audience stood and put on their cardis and coats, the blokes sat quite still for a minute or so :-) .  
"What are the two subjects we can combine to evoke sympathy from a guilt-ridden audience while still being original in an annoying Paulie Shore kind of way?"
The woman is holding a machete for crying out loud, and he's still trying to rape her.
It has its flaws but the biggest flaw is that many of these topics still go unrepresented on the big screen.
Because of this, one can view the film several times, and still not see everything it has to offer.
I believe this is a must see for everyone regardless of races..The strength alone of the people, to deal with what they faced and to still rise above that is absolutely Incredible.
Alex Hailey's roots comes to mind, or Gone with the Wind, or any number of Hollywood films about the west that typically just discount the true meltingpot, sumptuous and magical founding of this still very much troubled nation.
They were magical people, these men and women and children, who American history still would demeaningly classify as slaves, rather than people who were enslaved, a seemingly minor distinction, but in that distinction rests acknowledging the wrong done, and the people, the people, not slaves, the people... it was done to.
When the sign "the end" comes, you think that something is missing, it's not possible an ending like that, maybe the deadline are the only explanation for such a sudden end, when you're still waiting for something that justify the movie.
This is about Spain in the 70s, with the falangists still in power.
Pablo Berger, the director of "Torremolinos 73", takes us back to the Spain of the seventies when Franco was still around and where he sets the scene for this satire about the clandestine porno industry.
I am well and truly amazed at this game, still.
Humour has always been the main thing with Monkey Island and the classic laughs of the first game still work well.
And yet, women still did not have the right to vote.
It should not be overlooked that in many other parts of the world it is a right that is still denied; for too many women it remains a distant hope.
This is an important film that should be seen by all to remind us that our country has had and still has a history of denying basic rights to it's citizens.
I just saw a sneak preview in a movie theater, and my heart is still pounding.
It's still ludicrous at times and yet the viewer welcomes it and enjoys it.
I remember this movie serial as a boy in the thirties,we would ask our mother's for a penny on a Wednesday after school,and line up at the local movie house along with hundreds of kids..mostly boys,it always promised fast action,the Mystery Squadron who had their hideout in a mountain cave,the Black Ace the leader always seemed as though he would never would be revealed,would provide the bad deeds,as the action heated up thousands of young feet would stomp on the balcony floor,it was a wonder that it never collapsed.it would build to a crescendo,THEN it would stop suddenly,everyone would hold their breath as the hero would be put in seemingly inescapable peril,NEXT WEEK...see the next thrilling chapter,we would pile outside still gripped in the spell and discus with actions what had taken place,we would then speculate as to how he was going to get out of this latest fix,Bob Steele,Tom Mix,Hoot Gibson,Buck Jones,Ken Maynard,our heroes,who never kissed a girl,in our games no one wanted to play the Black Ace.Happy innocent days.
Goldblum is quickly becoming a favorite actor of mine, while Huston proves that she still has the ability inside of her.
Duccio Tessari really ought to be applauded for this truly proficient but sadly still neglected Giallo-achievement!
Sure she could hunt better than Knuckles and run faster than Sonic, but being a bat, she still couldn't walk on ceilings or use any supersonic waves that bats would use.
I still play it since there's so much to do (get every emblem, get perfect scores, etc).
Times Square was my favorite movie 20 years ago and I still love it today!
I wish she was still acting.
I still love the sound track and didn't even mind the obviously mismatched inclusion of the BeeGees song (my musical tastes are very eclectic)--I thought the lyrics went with the plot.
I've got the album way back when and still listen to it.
Despite some poor editing I still have to recommend the film, because of the performances and the gritty feel.
This impressive time capsule of late-seventies/early-eighties NY is poignant at times, but still fun to watch.
Curry plays a DJ with a bit of a cult following, and here the movie is clearly playing on Curry's cult appeal to RHPS fans -- in 1980, Curry was still sexy as hell, was recording rock albums (remember I Do the Rock?)
After seeing the actual feature I went out and bought the double album, which I still own.
The movie is still lame.
The second cut scene is less brilliant and rather politically incorrect, but it's still a shame it was eliminated.
i found the ending predictable and half way through i was hoping it didn't end the way i knew it was going to, and at that i thought it ended too quickly and left too much still open for thinking.
But it still has left one, strong, lingering impression.
Maconel has fantasised being with Vanessa for years and still likes her the same way despite her condition.
Despite the aforementioned reliance on visual effects, the film is unquestionably carried by the barely-recognisable Slater who, despite his recent collaboration with tragically awful director Uwe Boll, proves that he is still worth something in Hollywood, with comic timing that is nothing short of spot on.
A surprisingly understated (until the climatic scenes) conundrum surfaces as an aside to this drama Â Bob still finds those around him utterly repugnant, and he considers whether or not to carry out what the other gunner started, as well as putting Vanessa out of her misery, of course.
It may be exaggerated, and at times, even humorous, yet its approach is undeniably refreshing, particularly in relation to how the disabled manage to still engage in an active and healthy sex life.
They're still married.
Truly textbook psych101 stuff but still fun to watch.
Actually, I haven't seen one film of Lynch whose philosophical questions wouldn't be covered in Schopenhauer's work, but I like his films still, because he always goes a step further, personalises the questions, links them to his own life.
His resemblance to his father was so striking, and she was still so very beautiful.
Inland Empire though, sheesh, I still have no clue what many of these scenes mean.
the director says but she still hasn't woken up.
Whatever, it is still hypnotically watchable which says a lot for Lynch.
It is also far from being a great film, (though it has at least one great sustained sequence - you figure), and at times it resembles nothing more than the out-takes from "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Mulholland Drive" though it lacks the cohesion of those films, (it's the most off-the-wall of any of Lynch's works and that includes "Eraserhead), and yet it is still extraordinary, unmistakeably the work of a unique and visionary artist and no-one, only Lynch, could have made it.
And although I will admit that I will still miss the look of a David Lynch movie on film, I didn't find anything to be lacking at all.
Perhaps there is some way out still, into Sweetness, to The Palace, to Pomona (a city named after the Roman goddess of abundance).
still seem a little hazy at the moment, so I apologise if the following is, well, junk frankly.
While it is still not his best, it's among them and it's what Lynch fans have come to expect and love.
This new work, three hours long but unified by a savage and harrowing performance by Laura Dern channeling three or four or more overlapping personalities growing out of a lengthy free-standing monologue that was the film's starting point, is proof that the man isn't playing; hasn't lost his touch; still produces work unlike any other, work to be treasured.
There's a group of pretty prostitutes in a motel room, who talk to Laura Dern's character and sing and dance, "Do the Locomotion," and then at the end lipsynch Nina Simone's "Sinner Man" behind the closing credits -- one of the great closing credits of recent decades, a rollicking, gorgeous episode, which cheers you up but still contains flashes (Laura's face) that haunt you with memories of the strangeness and terror that's passed.
Lynch still seems to want to take a stab at the evils of Hollywood.
Very few movies have the overall excellence of this one..."My Favorite Year" melds together a superior script, outstanding ensemble cast, and outstanding direction from Richard Benjamin...and the crowning achievement of it all is the tour de force performance by Peter O'Toole...Mr. O'Toole takes a character that potentially could have been a buffoon and creates a hilarious yet touching portrayal of an aging action film star who has to do American TV for his "new business associate- the IRS"...assigned to watch over our British invader is Mark Lynn-Baker, who is lucky to still have hair by the end of the show...which by the way is one of the cooler endings ever...and ya gotta get the movie to see it for yourself...I could say something wonderful about each member of the cast...and you'll want to pay particular attention to Joseph Bologna as "King Kaiser"...in fact, rent this movie, enjoy it, then buy it...you can watch it over and over again and love it each time...one note...the scene with the firehose on the roof is one of the funniest movie sequences ever...but it is all good...and I loved it!
It loses a lot on TV, but it's still enjoyable.
A time where TV was still a novelty.
Now 57 years later I can still do it.
After 20+ years, the characters, the situations, the wise-cracks....they are still funny!
I used to watch this show as a young teenager every week and now I'm watching it every week as a young adult and I'm still loving it.
And i know i will still love it after 10 or 20 years.
they only just recently opened a new one across from the Public toilets, the old bank   they only got Bendigo bank now , the Pub that they used has now Been Reopened was closed for a while, they only had one pub for awile down near Primary school end great people there nice lunches the emppty Bakery still there, the supermarkets still there, the chemists still there, most hasn't changed they still use the football Ground minyip-Murtoa alternate games between Minyip & Murtoa got a lot of friends both places   i remember going into the Milk Bar where i met Viki Blanch she was nice some talk to you for a while especially when their between shots
In this film, Jimmy's character never meets the title character, but The Schnozz still shares some scenes with Rupert.
There is also a great supporting cast of young actors including Samuel L. Jackson when he was still known as Sam Jackson.
Scenes are still being quoted amongst my peers and has definitely lived up being a "hood classic".
This cavil to one side this is a seriously pleasant movie and if families still exist this is the sort of stuff they should be watching en masse.
Now, six years later, I still cry when I watch this film.
While this is not as good as Seth Macfarlane's other work, LARRY AND STEVE is still pretty funny.
but it was still pretty good.
Cut to around 2003-ish, where we meet are heroin Vanessa, daughter of one of said killed persons from 1987, who's convinced aquanoids are still out there.
HOWEVER, the one remaining goofy old guy is still out to get Vanessa, tries to shoot her with a sniper rifle, but gets dispatched of via harpoon-to-the-face by a police officer.
it still is worth to watch, a very good time pass.
I am still amused and confused why this stinker ever made it to the theater.
saw the movie 25 years ago and still can find its traces in my memory - amongst these the strongest when Robert and a hitchhiker drive along a forest of power line pylons and find them awful.
The landscape, the lyrically still, gently moving camera, the haunting, 'dehumanized' pop strains of Bowie, Lovich, Kraftwerk; these phenomena bring out our responses... Or rather the cumulative effect does.
I didn't know that this kind of movie was still made in HK.
Graphics (4/5): The graphics, while not as stunning as Bahamut Lagoon's graphics, are still beautifully crafted.
Not one of Hitchcock's most outstanding thrillers, but still: a Hitchcock.
The film opens with a theatre curtain rising and we are immediately introduced to a postwar London still containing the ruins of World War Two.
"Stage Fright" is an entertaining and mostly lighthearted mystery; perhaps its themes are less consequential than in other Hitchcock films, but it still delivers a good time.
Even though it's not in the same league as "Psycho" or "Rear Window", it's still an extremely delightful piece of film making.
Although most people still don't want to ever think that the characters in a film are lying, you still see it, especially in neo-noir (think Chinatown, Body Heat, etc, although those aren't flashbacks, per se).
I still remember how the touching story burned inside of me, and the soft music that soothened the flames, created a epic memory.
And if you're the type who likes throwing-knives, lurking, complex revenge plots, and barbarian swordplay, this is still the movie for you.
Endurance: 24 years on and the film is still standing strong.
The director still hasn't made anything nearly as impressive as this film.
I still remember how the touching story burned inside of me, and the soft music that soothened the flames, created a epic memory.
The whole story takes place in 900's, so Iceland is still a heathen country, god Thor is frequently mentioned and his one-eyed figure is also often addressed to by several characters.
I still think this could have been a really nice movie and it had it's moments.
All three of them are quite different, still tight together by a deep friendship.
I saw it four days ago and it still hasn't let go of me.
So that if you're really down, there would still be the music...and when you're the happiest in your life the record would skip and the moment would never end..." After their last night, when Floyd looks up into the Hamburg sky one last time, the soundtrack to the film DOES skip and captures that perfect moment, the essence of parting, that loss that really isn't and that unbearable inevitability that tomorrow your best friends will be far away.
By the time he did "The running,jumping and Standing Still" movie in 1960 just about the only person in the UK still doing "The Goons" was Prince Charles.
And although this film doesn't carry the Richard Lester stamp, it is still one of his best films.
It still stays with me...clearly and distinctly.
It was as though the character in Petulia got transferred to New York, still lost but still the good doctor.
Christie was so young and Scott was also still quite young as well.
While not great or amazing like the contemporary films of Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s, this is still pretty good and watchable--particularly the slapstick ending!
It is a motion picture that makes you cry, laugh and admire this little guy who is just struggling ten times more than the others and still trying to handle everything...the story is full of feeling, and the father-son combo Smith is just as genuine as they could be.
It's nice to see him move towards movies that raise issues in today's society and provide inspiration to the average person, however I hope he still does some action films :D.  I would recommend this film to someone who wants to experience something real in society, instead of clichÃ© violence and romance.
I'm still working on getting the job that earns me enough to have a less painful life - when Chris finally achieves it, I want it for him so badly that I feel it in the very fibre of my being.
His comic timing is still evident in the lighter moments, but it is his sincerity in playing a man with no options, no family, no help and little hope that shows him shining.
50 Cent.. and how he's still around..
Myths are not necessarily false simply for being myths--we can make some of them true by choice, and our belief in this myth still helps make America great.
The characters are bland, with very little dialogue, in fact, there is really only an escalation of dialogue after the 40minute mark, till then it is pretty much people running, but don't worry after the 40min mark, people still run for the majority of the film.
Besides, the twist is managed covincingly enough Â and with enough respect for the audience's intelligence Â that it still packs a pretty good punch.
Although it's definitely not his best performance, it is still very good, not worthy of a Razzie.
There are still scenes with stagecoaches and saloons, but they don't seem as romanticized as in other Westerns.
Yet "Wyatt Earp" would still be bad without this sexism.
I kind of lost my understanding of what was going on in the last hour or so, but it was still worth seeing the events in Tombstone and O.K.
I know it's a low-budget, but still.
Movies like The Shining and Taxi Driver were also made in the 70's and they still look great.
The ending is somehow predictable, but it's still shocking.
IMO: While I've seen worse, this was still not worth watching.
it is still a low budget movie, a very low budget movie in fact, but that gives this movie just that specific feel and gritty look.
The ending when he finally loses (reminding one of "Taxi Driver") is predictable but still powerful.
Creepy and depressing, but still worth seeing if you can stomach it.
Comedy, even black comedy, still needs a moral center, something we can laugh with rather than just laugh at.
John David Carson is less impressive as the young kid, but still turns in a good performance.
The film doesn't work at all as a mystery - it's completely clear who the murderer is right from the start - but still, getting to the conclusion is a lot of fun.
You'll never see a high school again filled with as many thin, beautiful coeds as Mr. Vadim presents in this movie all sporting the shortest of mini skirts that is, while they're still IN their clothes.
I think the reason it still hasn't found a home on DVD is because the film takes a libertine view of adolescent sexuality, far more than any other American film has.
In Tombstone Canyon, orphaned cowboy Ken Maynard comes to town to find out about past and tangles with a nasty group of thug cowboys and the disfigured Phantom, a black robed fiend who scares the hell out of all who enter the canyon, a sort of western version of the Phantom Of The Opera mixed with a bit of Batman, who at that time was still a few years off.
However, it is still a nasty bit of femme fatale noir and thus enjoyable on it's own.
Though not in Linda Fiorentino's class - certainly as far as this role is concerned - she is still a stunning and sexy woman.
I was sorely disappointed to see none of the original cast in the credits, but persevered nonetheless; maybe it still had merit, I hoped.
You can still watch it.
Cause i am 11 and i still watched it.
It is more for kids than adults but some may still enjoy it.
The stand out scene is the one where he interrogates the Michel Lonsdale resistance man, and chops off his fingers while cooking dinner, we don't see it the camera pans away, but it still is terrifying!
The first segment with Vanessa Redgrave shows the problems gays have, because there is no way to have a legalized partnership... they are talking about it, but we still don't have the rights every married couple has... it probably was the best segment of the whole movie!
I was still moved by it and sad at times but overall it's very good.
Although there is still a lot of work to do, compared to 1960's, there has been a lot of improvements and more freedom.
Still, this, overall, is about two percent anime, which is not a lot, but still.
Alas, despite plenty of daft moments, the film still proves to be extremely tedious, thanks to a script that, like the movie's train, goes nowhere fast.
I didn't know what I was in for but the movie was so bad I can still remember how bad it was.
While this game isn't on the grand scale of GTA: San Andreas, it still holds true to the normal GTA style.
I recently got a PS2 which came with a controller,memory card,3 PS2 games and 1 PS1 game for a good price.I didn't play the GTA series when it first came out starting with GTA3 in 2001.I started loving the series in 2005 when I got GTA Vice City for Christmas.I loved it.I then got San Andreas and thought it was the greatest video game of all time.I had GTA2 as well.Now with my new PS2 I play Liberty City Stories which was originally out for PSP.This game costs $30.00 and it is definitely worth it.Remember this is a PSP port and PSP is not as good as PS2 so the game is definitely not as good as GTA San Andreas or even Vice City actually but it is still a good addition in the series.Liberty City Stories takes us back to Liberty City(where GTA3 took place).The year is 1998 and you play as Toni Cipriani.During the game you do various missions for different people just like in the other GTA games.When you are not playing missions you can steal cars,kill people and just plain be a cold-hearted criminal.The storyline in all the GTA games are good with Vice City having the best one.The storyline in this game is pretty good as well.There are some parts of the game that are not too good.First of all the soundtrack.Just like in Grand Theft Auto 3, aside from the classical music station and the 1980's station the other music is re-created.Not real music.It is re-created well but we want music that was popular for the time.Actually out of the whole series, this game has the worst soundtrack.Flashback FM is the best radio station in my opinion but there aren't that many good songs there either.Even in GTA3 the only good station was Flashback.It had some good songs from the Scarface soundtrack but there were so little songs.I like 80's music and GTA Vice City provided the best radio station with actual songs from the 1980's.San Andreas had classic rock from the 70's and great rap and rock songs from the early 90's.If the soundtrack was better the game would be on-par with GTA Vice City.Anyway Liberty City Stories is a good addition in the GTA series but don't expect that much since its a port from PSP.
I know it's a comedy, but still, you have to draw the line somewhere.
Sandler's character in "The Waterboy" was annoying but the film was still funny if you're in the right mood.
People in the Middle East dress like it's still 1989?
The story about A Mossad agent (Sandler) fakes his death so he can re-emerge in New York City as a hair stylist is a little exaggerated and with some repetitive jokes but still very funny to watch.
I also understand it was shot on a fraciton of the budgets of Chuck's, Stevens and Jean Claudes, movies and still manages to look the most expensive too.
I kind of knew Zohan would be bad inside but I still wanted to see it, I loved Little Nicky even though critics trashed that.
It gets a four because while it mostly reeks of bad, it still has some good jokes in it, the beginning to film promises a very odd and refreshing new comedy and the first 5 minutes will tickle your spine.
But then it just gets odder and odder - to a point where it's almost unwatchable and through this try hard weirdness it still produces some lovable Sandler comedy.
I'm still in awe of the throngs of people who were dragged screaming into this fiasco.
But I'm still frustrated because of the relentless cameos.
'You Don't Mess With the Zohan' is not one of his best films, but it's still enjoyable.
And yes, while I have aged a bit since I could appreciate the his silliness, there is still a part of me that enjoys the goofy fun that Adam Sandler likes to put on screen.
They went in expecting to see an evolution of Sandler's humor, and while I would say that Zohan raised the bar a tad, it's still Adam Sandler.
Every time I watch this film, and I still do, regularly, there is always something new in it.
Other reviewers have already commented on the superb photographic artistry, so I'll just say that, more than 20 years after first seeing it, what still stands out in my mind is its ending.
It's astonishing that (as of June, 2006), Purple Hearts still has not been released on DVD.
Until then, you still may be able to rent or buy it on VHS.
I can't completely figure it out, but I think the reason this movie failed to garner better reviews might have had something to do with the timing of its release; one must remember that the Vietnam War was still an open scab for this country in the mid-'80s, and all the film treatments of the war up until then had been pointed tragedies - from "The Deer Hunter" to "Apocalypse Now", "Coming Home", and even director Sidney J. Furie's other 1978 Vietnam film "Boys in Company C." So, audiences and critics were probably not very open at that time to a film about a romantic relationship in the middle of the war with a semi-happy ending.
While no masterpiece, I still recommend this little-seen film.
There's a night-lamp that still seems to work after 20 years?!?!?!?!
Nothing happens for the majority of the movie and when it does pick back up towards the end it's still pretty lame.
Over the decades this particular type of Horror film has evolved, from classics like 'The Haunting,' which eschews the use of big effects for suspense and subtle scares to more recent hits like 'Poltergeist,' which does a great of mixing style and substance, still being very scary.
The house is still haunted by the young girl who used to live there and her spooky clown doll (the clown is great by the way).
Why was Calen (Koestler's son) still writing "numbers" after the big crash was forecasted?
It seems a lot of the problems people had with the movie had to do with the plot, and while it's not flawless it's still really well told.
I still think it's really well made, but I have to comment on the weird symbolisms and imagery used in the movie.
Their final goal is to sacrifice all of humanity to their solar deity who they still worship.
Regardless of what I though of the movie overall, nearly 24 hrs later and the movie is still with me.
But that said, I would still highly recommend this movie!
This is one of the films that borrows, yet still stands alone in creating a revolution of beastie pictures.
Despite the fact that there is not ONE memorable moment delivered by anyone in this entire movie, Cage still manages to be out shone by everyone.
I hope that you love this movie as much as I did and still do.
Kurt Douglass while showing his years here, plays the street wise detective hot on the trail and his acting is still top notch.
As mentioned, the first segment is still entertaining.
Mrs Deagle, the harridan, is wonderfully evil and still scares me to this day (As does "The Wicked Witch of the West" in "The Wizard of Oz"!
The moments where he cared for Kira as his own daughter seem to momentarily suppress our perspective of his condition, but when he starts to put her in situations that suggest a setup for someone to potentially abduct her, we know he is still unstable and it keeps us guessing as to just what he is planning since he's spent a good deal of time reviewing his daughter's kidnapping over and over again, attempting to orchestrate what could have gone differently.
One still can't help but empathise with him thanks to a bravura performance from Lewis that doesn't descend into thespy showboating.
We know that if his missing daughter were to show up unharmed tomorrow, he still wouldn't be okay.
We see this world very realistically, with no excuses but we still feel great sympathy for Keane as he struggles to find his missing child and recreate his life through friendship with a woman and her daughter.
still, out of the 4 inuyasha movies out there, this 3rd movie contains all the good qualities an anime movie should have.
I really hope they stop making these money and time wasting, worthless peaces of dog sh*t. It seems that they're just repeating the same "jokes" over and over again and thinking that it still makes people laugh.
The cast is not extra ordinary, which makes it also feel so fun to watch, but nevertheless, the cast is still great, though the character of Billy wasn't the best they could have chosen, but like I said, that's part of the fun of it all.
I like the whole atmosphere of this film - it`s dark, but still hopeful.
On top of all this, there's a testosterone-sodden bi-line about these violent scum-of-the-earth criminals (who are yet still exceptional enough to be qualified helicopter pilots) that makes 'Shawshank' seem like a holiday-camp.
I found myself wanting to scream realizing that two more ghosts still needed to make an appearance if it was to follow the 'Christmas Carol' theme.
As Marine Sergeant Volkom, Robert Forster of "Jackie Brown" plays the bride's father who marries his daughter, and Anne Archer still looks mighty fetching as his divorced wife Vonda Volkom.
Waliking into the cinema i could tell that this would film would be a drag and yet i still watched the whole movie.
The whole thing was distasteful to say the least that any man can treat numerous women in that way and still get away with it, for instance grabbing the future mother in law's breast with not even a raise of the eyebrow from her in the least, any man doing this in the real world would have received quite a hefty slap.
Needless to say, they are disgusted, but Connor still has a knack for attracting adoring females.
Some people I have talked to said McConaughey has lost his touch in this movie, but I think just the opposite and is still a great actor.
He is getting older and I think still has some good movies to do in him.
And no matter what our main character has learned by this point, we still don't like him.
He breaks up with 3 girls on a conference call in front of a fourth girl and after such a despicable act, the fourth girl still wants to sleep with him.
the ending was very weak for an already weak storyline with a seemingly impossible wedding being put back on again after Connor has a 2 minute pep talk to the bride ,in which she realises she is wrong for not wanting to marry the man who slept with her best friend still sitting in the same car on the way to the airport.
I can look back on it now across the track of 80 years and still remember what it was like.
They met on the set of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, where Elliott had a bit part but Katharine took a shine to him and they are still married.
By the way, I met Anne Lockhart and shook hands one time back in the early 90's and she is still just as lovely and ladylike as ever.
The soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard and although Harvey Keitel is an "adviser", he still gets the chance to show that he is one of Hollywood's tough characters.
After the death of a family member, Kelly's Christian decides to turn against the crew that did it, becoming a powerful tool for Keitel, but the whos, whats, wheres, whens, and whys are never answered Â still giving us nothing but quick scenes, literally teleporting us from point A to point B, without reason or consequence.
Joe Dante's "Gremlins" is a fun and enjoyable film, but it is scary at times, but I still love it.
now here is a movie martial arts fans will definitely enjoy.i wish all of jeff wincott's movies were as action packed as this one is.i don't think you will be surprised to find out that the plot is nothing you haven't seen before in other b movies.but who cares about the plot in a martial arts movie.all us fans want to see is nonstop martial arts fighting and that is what you get in this movie.jeff wincott is awesome in this movie showing off some good high kicks to peoples skulls.this movie and martial law 2 are the best movies that jeff wincott has starred in that i have seen.this movie isn't as action packed as martial outlaw 2 but any martial arts movie fans will still really like this movie
Gary Hudson, while not too impressive in the fight scenes (at least where kicking was involved) also impressed me in his role as a man whose greed has led him down a dark path but who, deep in his heart, is still a good person.
There's actually a lot of pathos in some of the scenes between the two brothers, and both actors are totally convincing as two guys who don't like each other and are complete opposites in every way but who, in the end, are still brothers.
Although a small cameo, it's still awesome to have her around again.
My friend and I still talk about it from time to time.
And it's not as accurate as the New York in Spider-Man 2, which wasn't entirely accurate, although this one is still a major disappointment compared to the SM2 one.
I still cannot believe how Jose Cassella captured the images he did on such a low/ nothing budget.
Character development?, in a horror film?, who knew there were people that still used that....
This is the vomit-fest magic roller coaster ride that horror fans still go to the front row of a theater to see.
Ultimately though it is the performance of Diane Goldner, the real heroin of both this film and the TV show, that made this the first big hit of "Project Green Light" and I eagerly await her return... in the up coming "Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds" (still in production) as the Biker Queen this time instead of the Harley Mom in "Feast"(2005).
I thought Feast was a satisfying film.I will say I was just a little disappointed, because I was expecting a tad bit more, but still, it was very enjoyable, and even though at some parts I felt as if they overdid some stuff a bit, it contained cool action scenes, and I believe really lovable characters.Also, they kind of throw you off guard, and do some of the things that you least expect, such as how they killed of Heroine, which when I thought since she was like, one of the most important characters of the story, they would've kept her alive, and also at the part where one of the creatures devours that child, I wasn't expecting that either, which I believe was clever that they were able to do that.There was even pretty laughable comedy, which one of the best mixes of genre is Horror/Comedy, and like I said before, I was really into the characters, like the old woman and Tuffy were some of my favorites in Feast.This was a good movie, and I think it has a pretty reasonable rating, so I have nothing further to say, except that if you absolutely flat out hated this movie, you DEFINITELY need to watch it again, and maybe you'll see the error of your ways.
Even though there are no explanation to them, it still does not matter, as the movie just circles around the characters, and their battle to survive... which in fact never gets boring.
After all this time - it's been a while since I saw it - I still get a kick out of it.
I tried to indulge in Feast: Unrated, the latest Project Greenlight, umm...project from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (co-created with Wes Craven, the horror movie genius behind the Nightmare on Elm Street saga and the Scream Trilogy--still one of the best mystery-slashers ever made, even with the degenerating quality and originality that is seemingly inherent in sequels).
With style, charm, and humor to spare, this film was among the top echelon of movies from the glorious '80's (Man that decade was GREAT to be a kid or teenager in).Never overtly slapstick comical, this film is still tongue firmly in cheek none the less and seeing the amazingly great Dick Miller is ALWAYS a treat.
For the life of me, I still see no reason why the monsters decide to wear clothing and bulls heads when the bull skulls don't even cover where their heads are located.
Though a small gripe and not a defining factor for my rating, it still bothers me that creatures which hump items at random, eat humans whole, and throw up on people have some sort of issue with not wearing clothing.
If you're simply a horror movie fan like myself who has seen many and is looking for something that has slipped through the cracks.....I'd still suggest looking elsewhere.
I watched it when I was three, and while it did scare me there for a while, I still loved it a lot.
Despite the good actors, there were still some problems with their performances.
There are so many shots to savour, I'll name just a few which caused me an admiring intake of breath;- for example the scene early in the film with a reflected image of the at that point still optimistic newly-weds sitting by the frog-pond, the expressionist use of shadows seemingly radiating out from Fonda's cell as he paces it in frustration and what may have been the first cinematic use of the three possible "Hold the front page" headlines in the press depending on the outcome of Fonda's trial plus of course the rightly famous eerie smoky set-piece where Fonda panics and shoots his friend the prison priest.
This serene Spartan outlook radiates through the film's last scenes, as Eddie and Jo suffer their last trial, as Eddie gazes off inscrutably from a hilltop, still trying to elude his pursuers.
Fonda doesn't entirely convince, but the film is still very good.
Sometimes, large swaths of the show would go by without a single laugh, but you would still turn off the TV feeling you'd watched something entertaining.
The genius lies in the modest scale of the film -- it isn't just a crude horror film with evil alien species (see "Critters"), but a tongue-in-cheek parody of the rest, that still manages to fit in a few thrills along the way as if by accident.
It lost the darkness of campiness of the original and went for all-out laughs (many of which failed) instead of the laugh-out-loud laughs of the original, which were concealed within a film that actually made sense (in some ways) and still managed to be dark and fun.
OK, this has to be one of the best films I have ever seen, I saw it about 5 years ago when I was eight and can still remember it so well!
But I'll still give it a 2 out of 10, one, for making me laugh, and one also for the mum, for dealing with an alien invasion by getting completely blotto.
It wasn't as good as the original, but it's still a good movie sequel.
Even though I recognized him the show still was very freaky and scared me so bad that I had trouble falling asleep that night.
I first watched this around 5 years ago at 11pm with the lights off and a storm outside, Scary no?, Thus making me lose 2 nights sleep...The ways the Aliens were conveyed were okay, and the "powers" they had were a tad far-fetched but still a great movie to watch alone and in the dark, the bad thing though is if you watch it for a second time all the scary moments just aren't there leaving you to sell it or watch as your friends are scared by it just to play small jokes on them for a day or two(worked with my brother, so meh).
i think this film is psychological and really gets to you.evan thought this film was fake some say it actually happened and this was the remake, ethier way it still freaks me out to this day not as much but i get those shiverer's down my back when i watch it.
Genuinely scary and gripping from start till end, though still requesting more footage, this film gets a 9/10.
I am aware of it being a fake but I still liked it..
Apart from still shaking ( I don't like horror films at the best of times ), it was a really really good film, the screenplay and acting of all the characters was too perfection ( apart from the Black guy, his performance let things down I think ) The imagination and initiative of the scrip to make it seem like it was not plotted was one to be reckoned with, a truly amazing, spine-shivering film.
I still have tingles going round my body..I doubt I will sleep tonight!
Thank goodness, I can still watch FOLLOW THE SUN and relive my teenage fantasies.
All of the jokes are still funny, most of them are nearly identical, although on some he adds more, or does it with different emphasis, but that is expected.
Even though I knew every joke, they were still great.
is still an all-around well-made film with pitch perfect casting, exceedingly memorable and quotable dialogue, and the sort of high quality not generally seen in a directors' duo debut.
But still, It aired again a little while later and even though it was my second time seeing it, it was still very funny.
But still, this is a work which is undeniably a masterpiece of sorts.
Whatever the case, Seinfeld is a consummate professional who has obviously perfected his timing and delivery over his many years as a stand-up comic and he still has what it takes to make his old jokes work.
Yes almost 30 years after I read the book and saw the movie, I still have fond memories that are obviously lasting a lifetime.
The whole killing and story approach of this movie however still give it an overall original touch.
Later on after the ordeal the man still happens to be the house, but she grabs a shotgun and shoots him.
I still have yet to see more Bronson classics but I'm just getting started and this one definitely 'wowed' me.
I had still remembered since then some of the memorable scenes, like opening the fist of the rapist's body to find the button, and Charles Bronson giving Marlene Jobert the button.
Even though he didn't live to see his 50th birthday, he still looked like someone my father would have played bridge and drank gin with at the Tarratine Club in Bangor, Maine in the mid-70's.
You don't have to be a teenage boy to appreciate it, I'm female and I still laughed my head off!
But I'm sure that most everybody else will still find this funny enough (and short enough) for at least one viewing.
For a crime show to be funny, but still uphold it's great plots is something the directors should be applauded for.
Wherever you are Jack, we miss you still after 30 years.
The fact that the cast can take a lousy script and still get a watchable show out of it, is nothing short of amazing.
The part of the story about black woman's family was more believable but still not explored enough.
Anthony LaPaglia stars as Leo Waters, a Chicago-based architect whose domestic life is not as stable as his professional; to wit: his eldest child, Martin (Sebastian Stan), has just dropped out of college and his aimlessness leads to an unlikely assignation; his youngest, daughter Christina (Hayden Panettiere, currently on NBC's hit series "Heroes" as the cheerleader impervious to pain), whose blossoming into young womanhood is proving to be a painful event; and his wife Julia (Isabella Rossellini), a homemaker whose anal retentive disposition is masquerading some still waters running deep.
after one episode (i watched it on accident once after that 70's show, which is still the very best show on tv), i was hooked.
The half hour format makes these a bit lighter than Freaks and Geeks - and when this show was canceled they weren't quite as able to still wrap things up as with the earlier show.
I don't think I've seen every episode, but I still enjoyed it.
The acting is way all over the top but still works for this kind of movie.
This movie took the right influences and ripped them off in almost a cynical way but still this movie is cheese for the please.
Yes, this is quality here but still is entertaining!
Even if Gregg Araki didn't try so hard to be profound, his movie would still be horrible.
I'm still not convinced that James Duval is an actor.
During the night, the clerk shows up, still armed.
There is still life in this spin-off franchise.
And yet the viewer will still get the feeling that they didn't show enough emotion for the dog either.
The thing is, once the the head lands in the guacamole, it screams and lurches, as if still alive.
The opening credits claim this is a `heterosexual' movie by Gregg ArakiÂ Now that statement is still open for discussion.
It didn't take prisoners, and while its a bit dated it still has the power to terrify the audience.
That being said, "Evil Dead II" is still quite enjoyable on its own merits.
Also, the film is very atmospheric and still maintains a sense of unnerving creepiness, which was completely jettisoned for "Army of Darkness".
This one has plenty of gore to still appeal to fans of the original.
While its not as successful as the first installment, "Evil Dead II" is still a lot of fun and one of the best combinations of horror and humor.
Campbell breathes some life into this movie creating a frenetically eerie, over-the-top performance of Ash, a man having lost his hand by cutting it off himself still having a sense of humour and seeming to fear nothing(including in his performance).
He still is using a small budget in comparison to what an A-list film would take.
I own all the Basil Rathbone movies on VHS (he is still the epitome of S.H.
7/10 I still prefer the first film, but in truth they are about as good as each other.
"The Evil Dead" is probably one of the most popular horror films of all time and it has inspired too many horror flicks to name.It is not only extremely scary,but also gory as hell.In comparison to that masterpiece "Evil Dead 2" is nowhere near as gruesome,but it is still worth checking out.The camera work throughout the film is spectacular and the special effects made by Mark Shostrom are pretty good considering the budget.The cinematography is really beautiful and the action is furious.Some scenes are deliciously funny especially when Ash cuts off his own demon-possessed hand or when a woman swallows a flying eyeball.Sam Raimi was a really talented guy,he could be a real horror master but nowadays he is making Hollywood garbage.What a shame!!
According to most horror fans, this is the finest installment in Raimi's trilogy (completed in 1993 with 'Army of Darkness') but I still prefer the charming cheapness of the original.
You don't even feel sorry for the hillbilly who gets stabbed, slammed by the door, kicked, yelled at, while still being stabbed mind you, dragged and then finally something unknown happens to him under the cellar, but it involves gallons upon gallons of blood.
Army of Darkness (the weakest of the trilogy but still pretty good) is an awesome horror/adventure movie, with more laughs and less scares.
The performance by Bruce Campbell (Ash) is still the best I've ever seen in a horror movie.
Few sequels live up to the original and fewer still surpass it.
The rhythm of the acting, too, feels like it still is out of those vintage masterpieces of the 60s and 70s.
Even after when I came to know that Ashutosh Gowarikar is directing this movie, one who gave us amazing experience in "Lagaan" and "Swades", I was still skeptical to watch it.
The camera moves too slowly, sits too still, and those great costumes and sets don't get the treatment they deserve.
Here, they're in regular motion but it still feels like slow-mo.
I still think he has all the potential in the world, no doubt.
In fact, as how most historical epics would go, such as the likes of Alexander or peer Bollywood film Asoka (starring Shah Rukh Khan), while efforts are placed into extensive research to try and stay as authentic as possible, there still are various interpretations to characters, some of whom will be taken to task (like Oliver Stone's vision of Colin Farrell as Alexander the Great) by audiences.
Yes honestly, i still feel that SWADES is Ashutosh's best film, Jodha Akbar does not had the soul to hold the movie till the end.
Although she does not have as many lines to deliver or have as much screen time, she still makes you sit up and take notice of her through her extremely expressive eyes.
Nevertheless, I would still say that Jodha Akbar is a great effort and a well made film!
I saw the 3hrs 40mins film on Saturday but still its lovely characters and the setting has left me amazed !!!!.
Although "Hollywood" has long been morally bankrupt, we can thank God we still have some old and timeless classics, and some B movies worth watching like this one.
It wasn't as good as I remembered it as being but still better than 80-90% of the kids' movies these day.
Rowe and Cox (and the script, of course) made younger versions of two of the most iconic characters in all of literature credible as teenagers while still more or less staying true to the spirit of the characters in Holmes canon.
When D'Artagnan first sees Milady in the beginning of the novel which started in the year 1625 and ended in 1628 Milady was twenty to twenty two years old and towards the end of the novel Athos in the chapter called How Athos found his outfit Athos when he finds out that his wife is still alive describes her as beautiful,tall,well-made,blue-eyed with a strange look to them (which might have inspired the screenwriter of this adaptation to make it appear that Milady was a demon possessed secret Satanist) and blonde who would be 26 to 28 years of age.
There is even room for some humour (of the pitch-black variety) which is still very brave in a German film about the holocaust.
The music is quite haunting and lovely, although I still feel quite strongly that "Life is good" and I am not struck with a desire to end it all.
His widow,was found dead outside her apartment,She jumped out the window.When authorities arrived on scene,her record player was still spinning,Gloomy Sunday.
Going 5 years and still going apparently...  Now I'm no drama lover.
After you finish the film you walk away feeling the film is very thought provoking... still thinking about each of the characters and how they changed during the course of the film.
The one that really got to me and made me shiver is by Diamanda GalÃ¡s, the Greek born American singer/pianist/performer with the voice of such tragic power that I still can't get over her singing.
With all of these thoughts, it is still an entertaining and uplifting movie, with the most exquisite theme.
Fine acting all over the place, especially by Krol and Becker (still brave in German moviemaking to show a Nazi not as a complete monster, even if he is, after all, the bad guy), and despite the overall sad story executed surprisingly lighthanded.
What can I say, I just watched it once as it first aired decades ago, but still had positive memories and thus watched it again a few days ago.
(If you keep this in mind as you view the piece it will be easier to find other clues and make sense of the myriad allusions to anatomical development, sexual differentiation, and the period of embryonic sexual development - including the period when the outcome is still unknown.
This seems to suggest the splitting and multiplying cells of a still androgynous gonadal system.
Overall, it's still good old Conan!
I agree not all of his episodes are good but still he does an awesome job of making that show worth watching.
There's not a minute of the show that my abs are not still recovering from my last gut-wrenching outburst of laughter.
He just still seems pretty uncomfortable being the leading man on an unscripted show.
Little Dakota Fanning ,who plays Emily,is absolutely awesome in this film and i will be watching her career closely in the future and though this is the sort of role Robert DE Niro,the dad,could play in his sleep,he still puts in a great though slightly muted performance.
i still don't understand the story now about if Charlie was part of the dad or a thing that went into different people , cos what was with the pervy next door neighbour ???
still confused now and I've watched it lots of times.
I am still shell shocked, after watching this shameful waste of a beautiful island.
I can't even try to be witty, as my head is still spinning in disbelief.
They gave it a happier ending than Dick did, but still, a solid film.
This film and its music still stands the test of time as implied by the recent success of Diana Ross' CD, "Blue" (which was previously unreleased material originally recorded for Motown as a follow-up to this soundtrack) on the jazz and adult contemporary Billboard charts.
But this was supposed to give us Billie Holiday's story and that story still remains to be depicted on the screen Diane Ross did prove herself as a worthy actress in this and it's sad that this movie remains as the only one of hers that showed her in that light.
Although there is some doubt of the accuracy of the book in which this movie is based, I still found it enjoyable enough to watch.
And I think that's what the director wanted to clear up right from the very first scene, with a flash forward to Billie Holiday's drug bust while the credits were still on.
It doesn't take away the fact that this is still a fun movie to watch, but it at the same time also prevents the movie from being a truly great one.
Even though she did not win, we are still left with a performance of depth, passion and layers that could only be described as magnificent in an experienced actress.
In 1936, she was still playing small clubs in Harlem, and it is generally believed that she didn't touch heroin until the early 1940's.
Ann Harding plays Joan, the oldest of two sisters and the daughter of a man who is still wealthy but has been hit hard by the depression.
RAFTER ROMANCE had a good deal of pleasant humor still going for it, and A MAN'S JOURNEY has some wonderful performances and a good story.
Family and filial devotion are still big matters to people today, but this film stretches these points way out of proportion.
Brown manages to sponge off Harding (using up all of Harding's private money) but still coming back for more.
But still, at the end I felt a bit hollow.
This film was shown here in London during the Foreign film exhibition together with other remarkable Filipino films like Imelda, American Adobo...etc....the venue was a bit small( Riverside Cinema)thou the number of Filipinos base in London is quite large now but still of many reasons, Non Filipino viewers are more than our "Kababayans", i cant say that Filipinos are not movie goers cos it's not true.
it's a common story but it's still extraordinary.
But I'm glad this movie is still getting the appreciation it deserves.
The story is a kind of nostalgia, but is still  amusing tale, with not much tension and thriller, but still worth to watchÂ  (If you have a good copy of it...)   At a time Â I think Â in the eighties the film won a some prize in a Film Festival, in Europe
Characters are full of charm, flesh and blood, and life... yes, Central European life after WWI (some visits to the area are still a good help in order to take better understanding... but be careful because later the understanding becomes LOVE forever, I can assure)   Just waiting the next one by Menzel, based on another classic by Bohumil Hrabal: I served the King of England.
The movie shows that you can still make good quality entertaining family movies!
They are still fun to watch, and all are quite different in appearance and mannerisms.
Debby showed that a girl could still get a gorgeous hunk like Burt even when she was 48!
It gives us hope that we can still get a man!
Deborah Kerr still had a great body at 48, and that is why I think she did not mind doing the nude scene.
Although I understand she now lives in Switzerland, I have often thought that even though I am in my 50's and gave up the thought of acting professionally years ago, it would be great if she still lived in Hollywood and I was able contact her.
Deborah Kerr, I still love you and I always will.
All based on a Marxist conception of criminality in modern society that, by the way, still after 40 years rules among most criminologists in western Europe.
Delon portrays the truly reformed character Gino, struggling against the injustice of a criminal and legal system that still lives in the dark ages with a deliciously watchable class.
Let me start off by noticing the obvious - Ray Liotta is still one of the most underrated actors there is.
),against an elderly musician,minus one hand, who still manages to play violin by tying the bow to the stump of his missing hand.
Better still, Yust shows a genuine warmth and compassion for the elderly, scoring points for his incisive critique of our society's gross disregard for senior citizens and how said elderly are among those luckless and powerless people who often don't benefit a bit from progress and urban renewal.
Just as good are Ian Wolfe as the building superintendent, Ruth McDevitt as his wife (also the conscience of the group), William Hansen as a widowed writer, blind Peter Brocco and Frances Fuller as a wig-wearing agoraphobic who still talks to her dead husband and hasn't left the building in 20 years.
Dated but still worth it if you can find it if cult is your thing.
And while LL might have lost her Parent Trap appeal (the freckles, although this film shows that she still has some on her back) she can actually act.
A woman finds a mutilated young girl by the road who is still alive.
Lindsay, for all her personal issues, is still a really good actress.
In addition to the constantly surprising narrative, viewers are also treated to some surprisingly nasty bits of gore, but, unfortunately, no nekkidness from the star (although there are still a couple of moments in which she does turn up the heat: as a stripper performing a pole dance, and during a sex scene).
Eventually, the girl is discovered, mutilated, but still alive, and is taken to hospital.
She is found on the side of road weeks later, still alive, with her hand and leg viciously amputated by her captor.
But when she awakens in the hospital, Aubrey claims to be somebody else... a woman named Dakota Moss, a rough-living stripper who says that she is being mistaken as Aubrey, and that the real Aubrey Fleming is still in mortal danger.
But, I still had to sit through several scenes of dismemberment and pain, which made me sick.
Next she gets pregnant, but they still can't stay away from each other.
At the end Camilla and Charles are tearful that he is going to be married, but this still dosen't make them nicer people to feel sorry for, because of what they are doing.
There are factual errors, the most blatant being when Camilla tells Charles Princess Caroline is a prospect and probably still a virgin (this takes place in Fall 1979 when Caroline was married about a year to Philippe Junot).
This is why, for many people, "Grease" is still the word.
It also shows how virginity was still the vogue back then and that all the other provocative women were putting on a show.
I ended up seeing it three more times while it was still in theatres because it brought back the same feelings plus new ones from having watched the film from an adult perspective.
What makes this movie a classic is that it is still great even if you cut out the songs.
I have watched this movie over and over ever since i was a little girl and i still cant forget this movie, its so enjoyable.
That's the main reason that this film, despite being nearly 30 years old and set 20 years earlier than that, still manages to appeal to young people of today who laugh and have fun with it, and of course, sing those timeless songs.
However, aside from being an excuse for Frankie Avalon to sing that song, the plot line goes nowhere and she still magically graduates high school along side everyone else.
I'm a big fan of Olivia Newton-John and her (earlier) music, think she's lovely in this picture and a lovely lady still.
Although it is old, Grease is still loved and watching by adults and children alike.
Why she did not go on to reach any particular heights in her career is still mystifying.
She is a powerhouse and made such an impression on me with her voice as a young girl that I can still recall the lyrics to all of the Judy Garland songs she sang in this film.
In Paris where the World Championship was held, she was second after school figures, but the difference in score between her and VrzanovÃ¡ was rather small, so she still had good chances to win.
But she was still too young to be dangerous to my mother if my mother had taken part in the 1950 or 1951 WorldÂ´s.
Although her skating style may look a bit old fashioned to us now she is still a strong personality on the ice and also as an actress in the frame story.
This film is a step in the right direction for contemporary Mexican film, but it still has a way to go.  
But this is still more than good enough to overcome those obstacles.
I still remember after seeing the movie I was shivering all over,and couldn't get the crazy scene out of my head~it was like the first time i felt that way after seeing a horror movie,kind of cool in a way!For those horror-movie lovers out there,I'd say this one is a must see!
Later down the line (months, possibly years), the group of kids has a reunion at their friend-with-the-f'ed-up-stepmother's house and, conveniently, stepmom's still hanging around--though she seems pleasant enough.
However, if your intention is to get some scares, then this movie still delivers, if you'd be forgiving to the ending.
The road still carries its original name in some places.
The fact that I still remember well the movie after seeing it once about 7 years ago should tell you it made quite an impression on me, as well as my funny-bone!
When the great potato famine of the 1850s strikes Ireland, Katie, still in love with Paul, persuades Shawn that they should go to South Africa to start a new life...
Hot Bubblegum is the third entry in the Isreali Lemon Popsicle series.There are nine films in the entire series.I have seen the first three because they are on youtube.Part of the fourth film is on youtube and the whole film should be up soon.Anyway Hot Bubblegum is not as good as Lemon Popsicle 1 or 2(which was the best one), but it is still a funny 1980's teen sex comedy with a good mix of drama and romance in it.My only problem with this film is Bobby and Benji are always friends even after the events of the first and second film.In those, they always fight and never become friends again, yet in the next sequel, they are best friends as if nothing has happened.Also Nicki from the first film(played by a different actress) returns.Benji and her date and talk as if none of the events of the first film happened.Also in the first film, she seemed like a nice girl, yet in this one she's a b**ch!
I think probably most people should be able to enjoy this film in some aspect, at least those of us who still have a sense of humor childish enough to laugh at East-German bearded spacemen named RONK.
It was still good though, Slade helped add the serious tone and each character actually had character development.
The story of the Legion of Superheroes also gives an insight into the sheer heroism of Superman Prime back when he was still quite heroic and not tainted with the insanity that made him into an intergalactic scourge.
In fact I still remember when I saw it and where I saw it!
This cartoon still have the power and I believe that will have forever -  10/10
I have not seen this movie for years, but I can still remember it.
I was seven when I first watched this movie and am still captivated by it as a 26 year-old.
It's still watchable, but not quite up to my standards.
After that I saw "She-ra" again too, and although this show was a little better, I still found that it lost a lot of it's magic during my growing up.
)but the film is still a mighty good piece of nostalgia and melancholy.
After reading the many comments on this site,I slapped it on again today.Those remarks praising the use of Wagner's music as used in the film were just a little off the mark.This whole film is Wagner minus the arias.Richard would have loved this!There is a near cultish devotion to the nobility of barbarism in it's purest form.Lancelot was heroic ,literally till the armor came off.If Boorman hadn't thrown in the occasional reference to justice for everyone I believe Hitler himself would have financed this film.This is close to Aryan mysticism [without the Aryans].I'm surprised Boorman mellowed to the point he could make "Hope and Glory".Aside from the Wagnerian fatalism,I still love this film!
Forget the 14th century plate armor,17th century saddles,and polo ponies with polo bridles.This is still the best Arthur to date!!
They were flawed, and still we loved it... because we knew how to suspend our disbelief.
This movie was far more impressive then it's contemporary rival the rather silly (though still enjoyed) Conan the Barbarian.
The most moving part for me is still the climatic finale, in which, after the death of Arthur, and the world seems to have ended, Excalibur is brought back to the Lake and Three mysterious queens take Arthur away on a barge, all this while the dramatic music to Wagner's Siegfried's Funeral March blares triumphantly.
Humanity is flawed, the end of the world is coming, but the world may still be renewed again.
Of course, if the film has any reputation at all it is with its vicious battle scenes, which are still gory even today.
Having seen the film numerous times, I still get more out of it with every viewing.
And there, she produces the ancient timeless object hidden beneath some linen: the sword Excalibur, still gleaming, still magical, still potent to fight in the battle that Arthur cannot win.
However I still don't understand the anachronisms.
Some of the hair-styles and special effects are not quite what they would be today, and the quality of the dubbing is not first-rate, but this is still stunning.
You get this series, the first and third series if you can get ahold of them, a lot of movies (Though I only like a few), 2 manga series (One hasn't completely been out yet though, and there are others that haven't been released in English) as well as Lupin the first stuff (Novels from Maurice LeBlanc that Lupin III is based on, as well as movies based off those books, most being hard to get ahold of though), some people don't make their Lupin stuff very Lupin-ish though, so even if you don't really like what Lupin is, there still is probably something with the Lupin name you'll like.
In her delusional world, all the characters still had parts.
Marissa Tomei is still very Hot and a great actress who gave a stellar performance.
Difficult question as I still favour the original version.
There are still lots of loose endings and unresolved questions, but maybe this movie was just too "psychologically thrilling" for us to understand!
You know, the typical soft-horror/thriller/drama flick in which the main character keeps having hallucinations and visions about horrible things happening around her and the rest of the characters are dead worried but they still don't do anything to help her out.
Psychological thriller .. well the thrills are a bit artificial and unrelated to the story but there's a bit of suspension still.
I personally thought it was a bit too dragging and slow to rank anywhere higher than 7/10, but a decent psycho-drama still.
The only thing one can recommend about this familiar drama (which still doesn't make it worthwhile) is the solid acting: Barkin's performance stands out.
Weak as he was in all ways he still responded, to great familial damage.
Oh well it was an amazing game with hard puzzles but still the best game I've played for GBA so if you don't have this game BUY IT!!!!!!!!!
i was disappointed at the end, thought it would end differently felt like an enrage about what happened at the end, i think perhaps it could have had a different ending and still have the same impact.
Originally a 6 part three hour TV series about a rocket that returns to earth with only one of its crew still alive, and he's horribly changed.
That said its still a very good retro-sci-fi drama 7 put of 10
I enjoyed it particularly because all of the characters from the cook to the main characters were very likable, and in spite of the brief nature of the film, I felt that they were still well developed.
I would still recommend it if this type of movie in general is your cup of tea.
Although it is in a completely different language and you have to follow it by subtitles, the morals of the film are still clear.
Maybe because of that particular scene, one can survive as a viewer to the end of the movie, and still feel light as a feather.
I'm still thinking about the movie two days later.
I still can't describe this story in few words, is one of those one in a life time experience, its very short but great, you have not a full, crude view of any relationship or the bonds among characters but everything is there.
This is live TV modernized but not homogenized... assembled using the best of current technology, but with the emphasis still very firmly on script and performance.
There's still much to admire, and any reservations are dispelled by the central romance, depicted with disarming frankness and performed with relish by Knoller and Levi.
But still, it's the most wholesome gay film I have ever seen.
I just saw this movie- in fact its still going on- at the Miami Film Festival and it is another movie about people making movies in Hollywood.
Norma will do anything for him, and she also truly believes she is still famous even though people barely remember her and she can make a comeback to Hollywood.
It's been almost 60 years since the films release, and yet today, it remain as relevant as ever, as still the biggest stars in the world, gets destroyed for the exact same reasons as displayed in the film.
He goes through the forms of saying he doesn't want Norma's gifts, but he takes them, claims to be surprised on New Year's Eve when she throws a party just for the two of them, but surely he has known from the first that she wants not only a writer, but a young man to reassure her that she is still attractive.
All in one, I still don't know how the movie hasn't got the most important of all, the Oscar for Best Picture.
Cecil B DeMille, her card-playing buddies, even security guards still working at the studio.
If he'd never actually heard of Norma's fate then he would have been long gone but once it was relayed to him, and still with the fresh memory of the part he played, then he had to make sure that he hadn't done any long-term damage.
"I'm ready for my close up Mr DeMille" is an unforgettable line and still remains powerful, with the performance stealing the scenes.
The film clearly shows us that at age 50 Norma is still vibrant, still beautiful, still energetic and eager to make movies.
I know, there still serious discussions whether Judy Holiday really deserved the Oscar, or if Swanson wouldn't have lost to Bette Davis performance in "All about Eve" anyway.
Much more important for me are the results: We still watch the movies, if it's "Born Yesterday", "All about Eve" or "Sunset Boulevard", we still enjoy them and still are enchanted by the performances.
I didn't throw my gum away like Gillis does, but still, I did feel a little disconcerted.
Despite the fact that the beginning reveals the end, Sunset Boulevard still manages to keep you hooked from the moment Holden sits at his desk for the first time right up until the movie's cruel, haunting, tragically human conclusion.
Almost every sentence, remark, Swanson's antiques and postures have become part of our cinematic heritage now, we sometimes forget how delightfully crisp and clever the dialog was at the time, and still is.
Of the three directors featured in the film, Cecil B. DeMille was still well respected and would make some of his greatest films in the years to come.
To those who have never seen it, you are warned that it is not an easy film to view, it being a portrait of a pathetic has-been silent movie star who still thinks she can come back after a long hiatus and be a star again.
-- again her playing is ratcheting up emotionally into madness, yet is still as contemporary as any Stanislavski method.
You could still see the magic that had made her the global phenomenon she had been in silents.
You could still see the technique that astounded audiences with "Sunset Boulevard" three decades later.
It's ironic that Norma has no place in Hollywood (the parade has passed by) but DeMille is still working and in the scenes from Samson and Delilah we spot other old-timers like Henry Wilcoxon and Julia Faye--still working but not as STARS.
I can still watch Gloria Swanson in THE LOVE OF SUNYA or MANHANDLED and yup, she is ageless.
She is still twenty something.
Norma is demented and believes she will return to the cinema industry, and is protected and isolated from the world by Max, who was his director and husband in the past and still loves her.
The last time I saw this film was on 22 September 2002 and even having watched "Sunset Boulevard" for maybe five or six times, I still get excited with most of the scenes and I dare to say that it is in my Top 10 movies ever.
"The Making of Sunset Boulevard" with the presence of a still impressively beautiful Nancy Olson telling peculiarities about this awesome feature.
Sunset Boulevard still remains as one of the most eerie film in the cinema history and still a realistic depiction because of its reflection of Hollywood.
One of the reasons that this movie is still not dated is because of its courage.
Another wax figure still alive and kicking in 1950 appears as himself in an important role.
It's easy to see that "Profiler" influenced some shows that are still going strong today but it's dead-on serious approach is what eventually distinguishes it from the rest.
Surprisingly enough, I watched Gun Shy again with friends after watching Analyze This, and I still enjoyed it.
It was very fun, but still it had a serious and solid base.
But it's always there, waiting to shine starkly when the waters are still at last.
If you think you know how well Liza could dance, and how captivating she was on stage, and if you think you know how extraordinary Bob Fosse's choreography & direction could be, and you haven't seen this performance, then you still don't know.
Caught this about seven months ago and am still trying to take it all in.
I'm still not sure.
All in all I really enjoyed the film, I do wish I had been just a little bit fresher for the screening as per film festival requirements I had slept about four hours the previous evening and was still a bit hungover.
This wasn't the best PPV of course but it was still okay in my opinion  FIRST MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN & CHARLIE HAAS VS. LOS GUERREROS {EDDIE & CHAVO GUERRERO} FOR THE WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP Nice long tag team match to start the Backlash PPV.
Suddenly Big Show returns & while Mysterio is on a stretcher, Big Show grabs the stretcher & slams it against the ring post with Mysterio still on it adding more injury to Mysterio.
2/10  THIRD MATCH- JAZZ W/ THEODORE LONG VS. TRISH STRATUS FOR THE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad match but it was still pretty boring at some times.
And held together musically by Jaubert's haunting theme melody, which I can still hum in the nostalgia cupboard of my memory fifty years after I first heard it.
), she was still the Queen of the Concert Stage in the US and Europe.
I saw her on Broadway in CHICAGO in 1975, and caught her first "Post-Betty Ford Center" tour in 1985, and she was still brilliant (That's when she starting singing "When I gooooooooooooo - I'm NOT - going - like - El - sie!")
last time i saw this film beginning of March 2003. the magic was still there.
While Godard and co were still in diapers,Duvivier,Renoir and CarnÃ© were inventing the best French cinema that had ever been.
She will have to delude herself:what she discovers is ruined lives,regrets,embittered characters,human wrecks.Time is a hard Master and it leaves no one unharmed.As always in Duvivier's work,the harder they fall,the better the sketches are.For it is basically a movie made up of sketches,Julien Duvivier's mÃ©tier.All youth ideals have gone down the drain:the brilliant medicine student has become an abortionist;the lawyer with bright prospects now has a lousy shady cabaret;one of the woman's beaus is dead and his mother gone nuts acts as if he's still alive.Two of them have escaped to a doomed fate:but one has become a priest and the other keeps his love for something else than women .
i enjoyed reading the books more than watching the same tired old animation by rankin bass...fine for kiddies but still below par animation...why they went back to this low grade animation after ralph bakshis fantastic animation in the lord of the rings beats me.
For a 'Rings' movie this short, we are still able to sympathize with Sam.
i think she was such a great performer in her day , she still have that great performer in her to this day.
I gave this a 4 ... only because it is still Tolkien somewhere there in the background.
It is still the battle of Pelennor fields (and they don't show it just like dots as they did in the battle of five armies).
With all of this in mind though, in retrospect it still might have been better if Rankin/Bass had done the whole thing.
This is not a case like with "Hobbit" where leaving out a particular story element like the Arkenstone or Beorn leaves the whole still intact -- with a lot of things missing, even the elements that remain only appear in a warped and inappropriate form.
The ringwraiths look comical, like Scooby Doo villains, except for the Witch King who for whatever reason still resembles the scarier wraiths from the Bakshi version.
We're left with a very inadequate film, although it's still good that they finished the trilogy.
It is not overly accurate nor thorough, but it is still quite memorable and enjoyable.
The Toronto Film Fest alone, proves that Liza is still sharp as a whip!
And I'm still trying to find out the name of the male singer that starts Preacherman.
As much as I'm thankful for the careful restoration of this major event, I still feel that an integral part of the show has been slighted: the dancers!
(I know Candy Brown is still around)
I still hope for its return to video in some format.
Bob Fosse's choreography is still so modern looking and sexy.
Halston's costumes were gorgeous and even when he put her in knickers (which believe it or not were IN for about 5 minutes during this time) she still doesn't look dated-you just think "Wow, I didn't remember KNICKERS looking that amazing"!
Forgetting the idea of inter-racial economic cooperation and money making, the idea that a white and a black woman could become close is not totally impossible, and the issues of the problems both women have with their daughters are still relevant.
Among other things to note in this film is the use of the "Aunt Jemimah" clone in 1934 - a key to the long term success of that brand with the American public (and one that still exists), and the business deal that Ned Sparks and Colbert are negotiation with a clone of General Mills or some other food conglomerate.
But the acceptance of racial inequalities that really are not acceptable anymore (although much improvement is still needed) does stick in one's craw.
Now if Delilah was beaten and raped on a regular basis and still wanted to please her white employer while denying her race the previous poster would have had a point.
Maybe actors are not always particularly exciting and the directing skills are still under development, but it deserves a 10 for the pure display of genius!
But still, how does he come up with these sorts of things?
Certain scenes I would mark as some of the funniest I've still ever seen from Woody Allen.
This was the first time I have seen it since I was 13 and I am amazed at how well the film still holds up.
The other impressive factor about this film is that it still has a capability to be pretty close to the bone despite being over thirty years old despite not being anywhere as near explicit as predecessors which have covered sex during the following thirty years.
I saw her live years later here on my hometown, she is still great, but I think that this is her best concert ever.
Even the few things that don't are still creative enough to get kudos.
Gee, what a cast Woody Allen was (and still is) able to muster for his movies, even though none of them is paid blockbuster wages since Allen's movies tend to draw in a selective audience.
Not for the easily offended, this may seem tame by modern standards but it's still quite enjoyably racy adult comedy.
True, this 1972 collection of extremely lewd skits isn't quite as impressive and thought-provoking as some of Allen's best works, like 'Annie Hall', 'Manhattan' or for that matter even the follow-up 'Sleeper'; yet there's an energy to 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know' that Allen has not shown for at least a decade, and in that light it's still entirely classic.
Influences of both Monty Python and Mel Brooks can be felt in it, but it's entirely Allen; and still, it's Wilder that makes it perfect.
However this is still so bad it deserves a 1.
Not as terrible as people say... ...but it's still very bad.
Despite the logo that pops up every ten minutes, this movie still stinks.
It could make some point if it was released during 1995; 1996; or 1997; considering that war and Yugoslavia were still "fresh" and all... but in 2006, this movie just doesn't make sense...   Legacy of this movie is big.
it had potential to be a very very good movie, but still it's very good directed.
But still a disappointment.
The characters were every bit as likable as they were in the first- Bambi if you forgive the fact his facial expressions were overdone at times, was still adorable and appealing, and Thumper is hilarious.
And still laughing about those growling frogs!
Sometimes there is silence in the forest, and a character standing still while the light falls just so, to convey wonder or loneliness.
I must have cried 5 liters... And it left me with such an impact that I still remember the feeling that I had....
I am still a little confused by how many springs go by before the birth of the twin fawns.
), and, most importantly, a certain cheerfully off-target, yet still unyielding and unbridled go-for-it hearty gusto which blithely permeates every last fabulously fumbled frame -- this choice chunk of delectably dreadful cinematic cheese rates as essential viewing for hardcore bad film buffs.
I am partial to these movies because I live in Wisconsin where deer hunting is part of our culture but this one is still a cute movie(I really wish we'd get a look at the hunters in these movies though!).
The one flaw that comes into sequels is how different the voices are from the previous film, despite that you can still notice a difference, Bambi 2 fits the voices very well for the characters.
I also enjoyed this new chapter into Bambi's life as he is learning how to become a prince, but still holding onto his childhood and his favorite friends.
Faline and Bambi are suddenly in looooove with each other, ignoring the fact that they'd still be in the cootie phase at that point in time if you paid any attention to the original film.
It's fresh enough with it's humor but still stays on track with the feel of a classic Disney movie from the the opening scenes to the the musical score.
I'm an 18 year old guy, and I watched Bambi for the first time when I was 3 years old and I still remember how sad I felt when his mom died.
Story-wise, well....that's one of the things that I still ain't all that thrilled about .
Despite having been "kiddiefied" from a book that was essentially written for adults, the original "Bambi" was still a wonderful film that catered to both ends of the age spectrum, a talent that Uncle Walt had in spades.
On the other side of the coin, The Great Prince looked gorgeous as did the other deer.......Friend Owl was drawn absolutely spot on, though Thumper and Flower did look nice they still did'nt look quite enough like their original incarnations to retain all their charms.
Despite it's flaws, it's still better than all the previous Disneytoon releases and well worth at least one watch.
(7) When network moves show to a slot where it will get beaten in the ratings by a competing blockbuster, make sure production company still has connections at the network so they can sweet-talk and cajole the network's executives into keeping the show on.
However, if you ask me, it was still a good show.
Elsewhere" and "Dallas" plot points were not played out the way they had, "Newhart's" ending, though still funny, wouldn't have had the incredible explosive impact it had.
He's getting a little long in the tooth now, but I still chuckle whenever I see him on his occasional visits to one of the late night T.V.
Nevertheless, the film still connects with us Occidental types, possibly because it explores that universal belief all humans seem to share - undoubtedly implanted onto our DNA way back in our primeval days - of a so-called enchanted forest, a place where evil in a monstrous form may be lurking beneath the dark underbrush ready to jump out and devour us at any unguarded moment.
Even if every single moment is not comprehensible to us, this is still a wonderful film to watch, primarily because Weerasethakul brings such a lyrical, impressionistic style to his direction.
Not only that, there is still a possibility that he did murder those people.
This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully.
If John Cena ever wins an Oscar (presumably the same year that gravity is disproved) it would be for the best animatronics in a movie, although I think that he still has less emotional range then that talking tree from "The Lord of the Rings."
Oh well I still get paid."
Looking over the posted comments here regarding this one, I can't help but feel that Television has wrecked havoc with the taste buds of most viewers- because MIGHTY PEKING MAN, more than anything else, reminds me of an episode of a really bad television show (take your pick, from day first to this- and they're still being cranked out with mind-numbing regularity); nothing more, nothing less.
The dramatic effect from the shots is completely lost, the acting is terrible (yeah yeah, I know they're kids... they were still terrible), and it's almost insulting to try to watch an hour and a half of their strained, horrible accents.
appears so calm and collected with his sunglasses and cool glare, via a long, still shot, is meant to force the viewer into seeing the Jew as haggard and racist, and E.S.
I still cannot come up with an answer.
Having been made 35 years ago this movie is still a winner as the environment it is happening in is kind of timeless, and the animation dolls are just as timeless.
The viewer can decide what sort of leauge it is.First things first,some reviews have given the impression that the bad girls/innocent boy scene is more graphic than what it is.It's a scene that's more like 50% visual-50% imagination.The newspaper in the film states that the young man was attacked,it doesn't use the r word.Some reviewers are stating an act happened that the law says is not possible.At least that was the law when I was an adolescent more than 40 years ago and spent time researching important information like that,I'm still trying to figure it out.
Still after all these years watching this movie again and again I still can barely believe it's norwegian!
Too bad it contains so many internal references to norwegian characters and surroundings as these jokes then will be somewhat lost to foreigners, but there's still lots and lots left.
But the film still provides a good lesson for young filmmakers about what to do, and especially what not to do, when making a cheap movie.
(possibly because Ed Wood only wrote it, didn't direct it) but it's still terribly entertaining.
While this tragedy is at times overly done, the point is still well made that parents need to be involved in their children's lives.
I'm sure that the translation is bad, but it's still worth seeing!
it wasn't really a movie.more like a collection of scenes strung(loosely)together.i'm not sure how much this thing cost to make,but i feel confident in saying i have more than that underneath my cushions.brutal,but still nowhere near as bad as Dracula 3000.a very reluctant 1* for the mouse's performance.
Sure it's not fair to compare it with Dawn of the dead, but still they don't even try.
And as bad as SON OF KONG is, I still like that one more; it's more enjoyable, more relaxing, and there are way better fights because there are dinosaurs and giant bears and you can at least have a good time.
It may be difficult to understand all the humour in the movie if you are not from Norway, but it is still a great movie!
I am still puking!
At the end of it you think back to the film and although most of it was less than mediocre, you still class it under "Ok" simply because of the ending.
If you like realism then i wish you luck when watching this movie... and worse still it sucked 3 hours of my life away!
For sci-fi fans this is a must see, for everyone else it's still solidly entertaining 7/10
I watched this movie on video last night and my stomach is still queasy 12 hours later.
The second story is by italian horrordirector Argento and it's at least twice as good, but still not good enough.
After all these years it still amazes me how big a blunder this film is.
For that fact, his wife still looked a little too pretty to me with that heavy make-up, which did not resemble any sedimentary cosmetics produced by mother earth.
Technically impressing in the 1970's, but still a charming and excellent movie now in 2002.
This thing has been unjustly compared to The Great Dictator, which is maybe the worst movie Charlie Chaplin did, but the the comparison is still unfair, The Great Dictator is an overrated sentimental bad movie, but it is not fascist propaganda like Roberto Benigni's.
Maybe that's why I can still be entertained by it.
"Allan Quatermain And the Lost City Of Gold" is the adventure genre's "Plan 9 From Outer Space" (though the special effects are slightly better), and I can still enjoy watching this delightly dreadful disaster of an adventure film.
But the film is still really funny (mostly unintentional, of course)so I would recommend it to any viewer who is scrunched in a seat with nothing to watch.
The ending was completely predictable and obvious as opposed the the classic what the hell ending of the original that still makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand.
I enjoyed most of the murders and even though some of them were a little bit far-fetched, I still think they were good enough for the slasher sub-genre.
As I pointed out already, I'm pretty sure a whole bawdy crowd will embrace this with open arms just for it featuring returning "stars", Paul DeAngelo as counselor Ronnie(..still in stunning athletic shape, but still lacking in the acting department), Jonathan Tiersten as Ricky(..blond this time, still needing his mouth washed out with soap)and special guest Felissa Rose as Angela in a cameo(..and in another secret role as well).
Though the movie is set in the real Ireland and not some fairytale facsimile thereof, writer and star Barry McEvoy is still guilty of spinning a totally fatuous yarn that strains a bit too hard for whimsy while at the same time never managing to find the right tone; set in Belfast "sometime during the 1980s," the movie revolves around two friends and barbers at an asylum, one Catholic and the other Protestant, who get the rights to the only hairpiece company in Northern Ireland, and thereby hangs our tale.
I'm surprised anyone is still able to remember or care about the murder subplot by the end of the movie since it concentrates more on the soul club scene of the late 1970s .
I am now 29 and still do.
I have not seen any of those, but still I urge you all out there, if you ever get the chance to see this wonderful movie, then DO IT!!!
and its so true but sad how even though her mom treated her soo bad she still loved her and felt bad for --what happened-.
I needed to see a young man still interested in becoming the lyricist that he once desired to be?
And I still think this movie is stupid!
Of course that's an entirely different picture, but still the racing scenes are conspicuously similar to the ones in the thirty-some years older Pinchcliffe Grand Prix.
Well, I do know which one I would vote for; still, I can't help but think how wasted the talents of Meryl Streep and Uma Thurman are in the absolutely dulling 'Prime'.
What was particularly disappointing is to see again that Hollywood still fails to confront the fact that meaningful, long-term relationships exist between partners in which the woman is significantly older than the man (including a large number of theatrical pairings).
I guess it's nice to know that Rip Torn is still managing to get work though.
She's still got "it," in spades.
It had some funny moments sure, but I still left the theater feeling empty.
And although the tragic female ribbon dancer/swordfighter (far classier than her descendant, O-Ren Ishii) gets relatively little screen time, it's still more than the later additions to the group get in terms of character development or backstory, which is practically none.
I still love "da boyz" and think it's theoretically very sweet that Brian Littrell helped orchestrate this monster, even helping write "Olive Juice's" theme song, so his actress wife could have a vehicle to spice up her career.
I feel sorry for all the Jews that died in WWII, but its still not an excuse for making such a horrible film.
Being made i 1975, the stop motion animation is surprisingly good, and the story still hold to the ones we have been served in more recent animation flicks.
I'm so annoyed by the film i am still planning my revenge on the "friend" that brought it over to my house.
I would further explain the similarities, but do not wish to ruin it for anyone who still has the desire to view this film for some reason.
The one somewhat positive aspect of the film was that there were attractive females throughout, but I still was very upset that I paid to see this film.
I have been privileged to watch 'Van Wilder 2: The Rise of Taj' while it is still a relatively unknown despite the enormous success of its predecessor.
Now those two sight gags may have been funny at some time on their own, but like a s... sandwich everything in between still reeks.
Let's start with the premise: a girl (freedom fighter/terrorist) becomes impregnated by a wounded "brother in arms" while they find themselves hiding from the government troops in a ditch (and the latter are still raiding the area, might I add).
Can she even stand still?
While this movie may not be the best in its class and may suffer from numerous flaws (rancid acting, unrealistic plot, pathetic villains, stanky clichÃ©s, annoying ninja kid grunts, Hulk Hogan's dialogue, Hulk Hogan's wardrobe, Hulk Hogan) it still maintains one splendid aspect which I find delightful no matter how many times a week I sit down and pop this VHS in: its soundtrack.
It still amazes me that this could have been printed, honestly, the movie is just one stupid gag after another, one's we have already seen and are tired of.
I saw the first time as a kid, and I can still watch it over and over again without any loss in pleasure.
It is a children's movie, in a way, but I'm over 30 and I still love it.
The number one cult movie in Norway still attracts full houses with its naive and wonderful tale of the bicycle-repairman Reodor Felgen and his two trusted companions; the porqupine Ludvig and the bird Solan Gundersen.
There are a few pop culture references there simply for the parents (and then, some parents are too young to appreciate them...I swear I was the only one in the theater who "got" the Poseidon Adventure reference...perhaps the other parents were still in diapers when that movie came out in the 70s...) but other than that not too thrilling.
Not particularly enjoyable as a thriller, certainly not scary and why the DVD still carries an 18 certificate in the Uk heaven only knows.
I really enjoy them... =) I almost felt sick after the opening scene... Who wants to se a girl loose all her legs and still keep on running?
But still, I don't understand, why 60 years after-wards, we still have to suffer by having awful German cinema !
By the way, I am a white curly blonde haired guy myself, all the more reason to feel shame and sorrow that our society is still this openly racist.
And yet, I still have nothing good to say.
But even if everything else was perfect, it still wouldn't have been good.
It wouldn't be half as bad, granted, but still not yet good either.
But for that kind of adaptation to be good, you still need good casting, good writing, good acting, and good direction.
The zombies in this aren't a bad lot really, they still have their human personalities & even though some like to eat human flesh most don't.
Not that bad of a film, it implies that a "Night of the Living Dead" type virus has hit that resurrects the recently dead, who still retain most of their mental faculties.
Besides the direction, writing, lack of plot, constant mugging (aided and abetted by constant straight-on camera shots), and a .050 joke batting average, it was still an utter waste of time.
20 more minutes went by and still - nothing too interesting.
For most of the movie, I couldn't tell whether she was still an addict or not, which I'd attribute to Heather's terrible acting and possibly some poor editing.
Why not years earlier in her life while she was still vulnerable before she had fully developed her personality & career?
"Citizen Kane" it obviously isn't, but it still manages to retain its overall fun and shock value.
While the American business man is supposed to be a everyday man we (or let's say a "western" audience) can relate to, but still stay ambiguous enough, that never fully gets "exploited".
She still shows her remarkable poise and maturity as a performer at a very young age (she was 11 when it was filmed), but this lifelessly conventional release doesn't deserve her.
Even as her parents try to calm her by telling her it wasn't her fault, she still blames herself, and has a tough time adjusting to her regular life back home.
why he would get a tattoo of this group, which is still in existence and in many nations, i have no idea.
And there you have it: You could have had a good movie, and still been politically correct.
Then you could have your movie and still be *completely* politically correct.
If William Peterson is wanting to leave the show, I bet he will still be the Executive Producer and will not want to lose the millions and millions of fans of the show.
Hopefully you are still awake by this time.
And it still won't help raise this stupid thriller above a one rating.
OK, maybe he didn't have a big one in HOHH, but he still owned a lot more than what he does here.
I can only imagine how the creators of this film pitched this and still got some idiot to pick it up.
Surely they can still do better even though they both have seen their best times.
IMO the worst was Steve the Drunk, but I would still give his acting an "A".
I got it as a freebie from Blockbuster, and I still feel cheated.
As in all movies of this sort, the villain's ability to destroy the heroes' lives is dependent on his almost supernatural ability to predict their behaviour, and his willingness to endure pain to achieve his goals; the film's execution is unsubtle and the every plot development is heavily signposted; but up to this point, it still holds up as a routine but serviceable thriller.
The officer said, "Whether he has a lease or not, he's still a tenant."
It can be fun for me to see how Japanese still are portrayed stereotypically in the movies from the west.
Because it's like gazing at a mirror which people living in a insular country like Japan lack and no matter how exaggerated or bad or untrue the stereotype may seem for the first glance, there is still something that holds true in it, something that reminds of part of self that we've been succeeding at hiding from ourselves.
Anyways, like I said, I still admire them for their mere guts in doing this film.
Through a town meeting filled with some of the most awkward dialog ever filmed, the superstitious ramblings of Gretchen Caswell (Jamie Donnelly) who is described as a "funny looking lady with white hair", inform us that "Martha's Land", where the windmills are being built, is haunted by a 250 year old ghost Martha (Rachel Harker), who is still involved in a never ending search for her abducted/murdered daughter Lucy Keyes.
appears and flies through a little crack in Lucy's window, but instead of grabbing Lucy as any childless mother ghost would, just stands still and allows the scary music to play.
But somehow Stewart has convinced himself that his interest in sharks, his efforts to conserve them, and his perspective on shark mythology are unique and profound whereas most people (except for Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd staff) are ineffectual morons still clinging to myths of sharks as vicious maneaters.
He's looking grim and bummed out, but he's still tanned, well-coiffed, and is obviously thinking about the camera that's on him.
The now-very ill Diaz is nowhere to be seen in Cavite, but fans of those low-budget Corman flicks might still enjoy this film.
He wasn't *as* bad as the others, but still had his moments of "Can someone please buy me some acting lessons?"
but hey i heard the original script (was turned down, you can see the guy's name still on the inside) it was R rated which sadly means it was probably correct, and they could have inserted a little of Chris and Cathy's relationship, right?
Yet there is still plenty of abuse.
It has been almost 20 years since my girlfriend of the time, an obsessive Madonna fan, talked me into seeing this piece of trash, and I still go to bed at night praying to God that I can somehow get that two hours of my life back.
There's no character development whatsoever, some very dodgy acting, zero chemistry between the leads and worse still, very little to like about them.
I never actually write reviews but this absolutely undeserved score pretty much forced me to; I'd hate it if you passed on this one just because some people are easily influenced by the news they're fed (note - I'm still going on my totally uneducated guess).
A perfect blueprint to filmmaker hopefuls who haven't the means but the idea, "Cavite" is bold, cunning and still thrills.
And though with the script still a bit amateurish, Gamazon somehow scores an almost convincing portrayal.
If you really want to see a good Swedish movie, see `Smala Sussi', or `Ondskan', better still, see both.
Even if it isn't really a horror film as some claim still it's a bad movie no matter what it is.
From the start, you begin to sense that this is an atmospheric film that may lose you in its boredom sometimes but still maintain enough of an edge to hold you for the near-2 hour running length.
I can't understand how this awful movie is on DVD and the one of the best zombie movies EVER, Return of the Living Dead, is still not on DVD.
The film is too bland to be truly terrible, however I will still give it a rating of a "2" for wasting so much talent (Rani and Amitabh) and for going nowhere with what could have been an interesting premise.
I am not really sure why I am still giving it 3 stars.
And, still, the guy claims that the story was his concept?
Her horrible warbling is exactly what the producers were looking for and back in 1934 it would have gone over quite well at the time--after all, she could sing, though in a style that is so out of style today that many will find the singing quite painful (my ears are still bleeding).
Good thing none of the cast is still around to be embarrassed.
I saw it once because of the director, lead actors and wonderful character actors (still I think the best part of this turkey.)
However, its still a league above David Spade, Rob Schnieder, Adam Sandler and the gang and for that reason I will give it 3/10.
The performances of most of the actors were good except for Virginie Ledoyen who still has not showed that she can play more than one style.
He played the part, but didn't build the character, and after all of it I still had the looming thought that Rydell left me with at the very end Â the "educated guess" which completely debunked the film Â but that is another story.
I think the other dilemma of making a film about James Dean is that he was so young and still in the process of rising to fame when he died, that there doesn't seem to be many significant points of his life that can be stretched into an hour and a half film.
Forty minutes into the film and I still don't know where this film is heading.
I enjoy dark, disturbing films, but it still must be a good film.
Wish the film's color quality had held up better with time, and of course today's sound would be better, but this is still a joy to watch and listen to.
When the film ends, more or less, with the utterance of "everything could still work out, maybe even tomorrow," the viewer is left wondering if Woody Allen was asked to provide the closing dialog.
and we still never see drew.
i still want it back though.
3: After one of the female character's boyfriend dies she runs 10 feet away and sits down crying, cut back to here 10 minutes later still seating then decides to make a move.
Despite some eerie locations such as the abandoned farmhouse falling to waste and ruin, a barn still equipped with livestock and hay, and a slaughterhouse up the road from the main setting of the film, there should be an abundance of atmosphere.
The artwork was fantastic and although it reminded me of the Texas Chainsaw I still bought it.
But there are a lot better Slasher style pics out there which have been made on a similar budgets and still retain a good story with lots of good chills.
Granted this was an amateur effort, but that's still no excuse.
So, "The Battle of Shaker Heights" was made and released, and yet again after watching I realized it's still more contrived, fluffy, and safe offerings into the film world.
Kelly played by the very talented Shia Lebeouf is a world war re-creationist who takes pride in knowing about the wars fought and is a bit rebellious, and one day he meets Bart the youngest in a rich family who befriends the troubled youth and the two become friends, until Kelly meets Bart's older sister Tabby well played by Amy Smart who doesn't seem to acknowledge the boy but still befriends him slightly and goes about her business.
They took that story and made some monster flick about how one dude (Tom Hardy from Layer Cake) found out his girlfriend was still alive in the maze and he set out to save her and the village.
Once, the Minotaur is only a few feet away and the guy still can't shut up.
He's also convinced that his girlfriend, who was sacrificed three years earlier, might still be alive somehow.
Cy Carter met the physical description of Shepard and at moments captured his heart but still left me wanting more.
It really shows how sometimes people can feel one way but still be conflicted.
Yet still, the message gets through and the important facts of the trial and ensuing panic were represented well.
But even with all the added on stuff, it still only runs 72 minutes long.
The presence of Benoit Poelvoorde is this unbelievable cinematographic shipwreck is the only positive element :  Scenario :	0/10  Direction : 1/10  FX : 3/10  Actors (except Lanvin and Poelvoorde ): 1/10  Images : 2/10  G. Lanvin : 4/10  B. Poelvoorde : 6/10  Total : 2.4/10 (I still have the feeling that I over-rated this trainwreck)
it's hard to believe that this movie got still so much of positive feedback...
Early in the film when still portrayed as a happy idiot the father is constantly abusive and stern.
This might be an indication that the distributors need extra reasons to convince people into renting/buying their film, because the plot summary and the still images on the back of the box aren't convincing enough.
After killing his mother, he's still loose?
Then, apparently not searched, he still has the knife at the funeral!!!
Seed was way more cynical than what we've seen from Uwe before, but still had some silliness because the absurd comic book-style killer.
It goes into horror-territory (almost) when the tunnels are introduced, but still keeps it realistic.
He's still your dad."
I watched it at 1.5 speed and still the pain did not end quickly enough.
I still don't know; worse, I don't care.
Phew, I watched this film last weekend and boy, it was pretty awful, but still, perhaps it was awful in a funny way.
I didn't expect anything great, but still it was a kind of disappointment!
Fulci, the king of gore, has proven in the past with such films as "ZOMBIE", "THE BEYOND" and "CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD", that a movie with a terribly thin plot and terrible actors can still entertain with high levels of unnecessary and perhaps redundant gore - but "HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY" is an entirely different story altogether.
The actors are little known but still I recommend watching.
He finds endless support from his curiously optimistic mom (Brinke Stevens), but is still torn between two peer groups at Hallow's End High.
!The acting I do have to admit was well,but the story line,characters and death scenes were either stupid,mediocre,or unexplainable.There are other films that are the same genre and fall under the same category as this one,and they all are way more superior.The concept however,was still just a bit creepy.If what had happened in the film happened to you,you would have to put yourself in the main character's shoes.Most of the ways people died were also avoidable.It just seems as if the director told them that they needed to act so stupid in order to make people like this film.Avoid this film as much as possible,but if you absolutely feel the urge to pick it up off the shelves one day,I warn you with the deepest concerns a person can have for another.
In Uwe Boll's stunning "Tunnel Rats," the increasingly interesting (but still no less maligned) German director has made what essentially amounts to a chronicle of the madness of war told in a confined, claustrophobic, and frighteningly intimate way.
I might be so wrong,because I haven't seen this show in years,but how is this realistic?And what the hell is with the slang?I'm around lots of gangs nowadays,and I've never heard anyone say I've never heard the word "shoobee"or whatever it was.Even when I was at the beach in Maryland,I never heard one surfer kid say that.And what's with he word "lame-o"?Honestly,these kids are like 13 or 15 and they are still using baby ghetto talk.I haven't said "lame-o" since I was like firkin ten!
I wonder if they still air it.
I give it a three out of ten because at least McNamara owned up to something, though not nearly enough, while Henry Kissinger still walks the streets with his goodies intact.
I hadn't heard very good things, so I didn't go into it with high expectations, and still it managed to disappoint, big time.
Not as awful as I thought it would be, but it still stinks!
Self-confidence is what I especially liked about this bald-headed character... Thirty years later, the kidnapped boy still roams the countryside in order to collect one hundred and three children.
I just wanted to cry after watching it and I still do...  BTW - I am gay, so don't start with the anti-gay movie review comments.
Maybe I wouldn't rather go to the dentist, but this film still isn't very good.
While the acting is not Academy Award Winning and the film is not the scariest horror movie I have ever seen, it still delivers a lot of what a horror film should have.
Well, I got it....I even went in skeptical, and knowing it was a lame 'un, but still was disappointed.
Being more of light-hearted kind of guy, I have to say that I personally didn't enjoy TUNNEL RATS as much as I enjoyed Uwe Boll's action-packed, over-the-top no-brainers such as HOUSE OF THE DEAD, BLOODRAYNE and IN THE NAME OF THE KING, but this doesn't change the fact at all that TUNNEL RATS is still one of Uwe's most atmospheric and coherent films so far and definitely worth watching for all fans of unsparing war movies such as JOHN RAMBO and Co.
The previous Basket Case movie was still a fun self aware silly movie but this movie really crosses the line.
The first movie "Basket Case" was still a horror movie, while "Basket Case 2" was more like a horror comedy.
"Basket Case 3: The Progeny" on the other hand is a full-blood comedy and simply for most part has abandoned the tension and gore the previous two movies still had.
There are still some gory moments but they mostly are part of the humor and camp of the movie.
But still because of the reason that this movie is a completely silly one, the movie remains still far more entertaining and watchable than just the average B-horror movie.
I still respect Henenlotter a great deal for his early contributions to the B-movie horror world-but both of these sequels just straight-up suck in my book...3/10
Duane still wants out of the whole situation and is retained in a straight jacket while the litter of small Belials are born.
Far cry was better but still not great.
though its not that great and still some visible cracks but at least its the cracks are not so wide.
the dialogue is still full of problems but the plot is rather good.
many of the characters were still 2 Dimensional but the music,action,plot made up for many of the mistakes.
I know many teen comedies from the early '80s still had that '70s sensibility, and nudity/vulgarity was common.
I did, and it still stinks!
Well, due to some really poor plotting, a total lack of continuity and weak directing, Joseph Mazzuca still somehow managed to mess it all up!
His role is simple and still he doesn't seem believeble at all.
This is definitely a film of and for it's time, although not  quite as painfully dated as St. Elmos Fire, you'll still laugh at some  of the hair styles and fashions and music.
And those that are alive still live happily ever after..or do they?
The scene is filmed in Moorpark, California in front of the Cactus Patch restaurant on High Street (the restaurant is still there and I highly recommend the breakfast plate called the "Riley Special")  The movie would put most people to sleep but I enjoyed watching it because it was filmed almost entirely in my home town of Moorpark as well as Piru and Fillmore, which were all combined to comprise the fictional "Finleytown."
Plot summary: Jody(Tyrese) is a 20-something slacker who still lives at home with his mother but is also the father of two children from different mothers, drives his girlfriend's car like he owns it, and basically is living off them both without a actual job.
I believe he would have still made movies of substance like Higher Learning if Higher Learning was universally accepted(with all its flaws) and not universally panned.
He still lives with his mother and seems to think that is cool for a man his age to do that.
Taraji P Henson as Yvette: a very naive young woman that sense that Jody is cheating on her and still sticks with him.
That scene is still a head-scratcher till this day.
(Spoiler) So, the moral of the story is that you transition from being a boy into being a man by moving into your "baby's mamma"s dilapidated apartment and sell stolen clothes on the streets, while probably still cheating on her.
The mother came close, but was still a few bullets short of a full clip.
Isn't dramatic tension and character development and the need to engage the viewer still a necessity for a successful story?
It's a disaster of a movie, and, considering it never actually gets to "move" anything, it should more be consider as a "still" than as a "movie".
The serial killer constantly looks at the camera intensely and asks us "insightful" questions like "why are you still watching?"
While I liked Helen Hunt's portrayal of Pam Smart, I still do not understand what was her reason for getting rid of her husband.
Hours later, the cut is completely gone and the lady is back to being full of life and still beautiful as ever.
Who could have possibly seen them that night - or was their 'victim' still alive when they dumped him into the sea?
Originality cannot be expected from the teen slasher genre anymore but an effort can still be made to ensure films of this ilke are entertaining and scary.
I recognize a good movie when I see it, but I can still giggle and smirk during Bubble Boy (yes folks, its true); so when I say to avoid something, you KNOW I'm not kidding.
Debutant writer-director Siddhartha Raj Anand, tried to delve into a mature topic and somehow manages to hold interest till interval with his some witty, smart, one-liners and hilarious situations when the film is still finding its premise.
and still that wouldn't give the movie a genre.
The formula of "Deadgirl" is dared and definitely a whole lot more original than the majority of mainstream horror movies being released today, but still it falls short in several other and equally crucial departments.
I am happy in a way, there is still an opening for a good film maker to make a wonderful Max Payne film.
It is, again and too often, sad to see how money can be used in such a bad way and I still can't understand how the cinema industries works so this kind of project can actually benefits to someone.
(By contrast, even if Seoul is completely flattened, South Korea would still be viable.)
Go back to the beginning and the Lutzes.could we have imagined back then what their hoax was going to do to the world .even to this day people keep trying to go to the house which has been remodeled and the address changed,hollywood still keeps churning out these stupid fictitous movies regarding the orginal hoax ..the owners who moved in after the lutzes never had any incidents and even sued hollywood and the lutzes for fabricating the whole thing.
I still fail to see why the guy's who made this film went through the process to acquire permission to use the "Amityville rights" which would have cost money.
Whats even worse is he's still training in the same stupid plimsols that gave him a gigantic blister in the 2nd training sequence, I also don't see how skipping or running up steps is going to help train for running on mostly flat roads.
Plus anything I say isn't really going to make much difference because the film's been showing for well over a month now and by the looks of it is still really continuing to rake it in.
how Simon pegg was able to walk those last 9 miles in about 5 mph while it was still dark and I'm not sure when i was supposed to laugh as its very poorly written with a small poetic plot.
For being the introduction to one of the most enduring horror series in European cinema, FRANKENSTEIN'S BLOODY TERROR is rather lame - apart from being an edited variant of the original Spanish cut, bearing the more accurate title THE MARK OF THE WOLFMAN - but one tends to forgive Paul Naschy the many shortcomings of his script on this occasion because here he was still treading the waters, as it were.
The acting isn't the greatest, the film-making is a bit awkward... but still, they have something-- a fun, camp sensibility, an imaginative bizarreness, some catchy songs.
And if even you do know the filmmakers... you'll probably still be disappointed.
25 minutes into the movie I was still thinking, "who are these people??"
I don't know if this is a spoiler or not, but I have no doubt that if the extremely unlikely events depicted in this teleplay ever occurred, millions of us (literally) would be out in the streets, guns in hand (yes, we still have guns up here!).
Just to tell you one scene: the police are searching for Snipes, and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars, they are shooting around inside the building, but still they are whispering so that Snipes doesn't suspect a thing.
There were children walking around, but the police were still stating they had a clear shot to shoot him, does this happen in London?
that without 9/11 they would still be trapped in useless existences not being able to break free?
They even do a pretty good job with what they are given, and I can't really fault any of them besides the fact they read the script and still wanted to be involved.
He still plays one-dimensional bad guys better than anyone (LEON, LOST IN SPACE, TRUE ROMANCE), and in SIN he does try.
It's unimaginable that this kind of stories still hold a grip over the public.
I thought Oldman's performance was a little more natural than that of Rhames, but his was still decent.
I was amused as I watched this flick how characters are blunt and honest about others giggling and insulting them while they are still in the room(..such as gardener Ralph who seems to be the butt of everyone's jokes, even though he moves about, saying little, without really warranting such constant ridicule, despite the fact that he's a wee bit creepy).
Even when they uncover the heavily-mutilated body of Ralph the albino gardener, they still refuse to accept that a maniac is trying to cut down the guest list for their Xmas party.
Director Jordan has apparently gone on record as saying that he had no input over the editing process & what was released was substantially different to his original cut, to be honest that sounds like an excuse for making such a bad film as he still directed the scenes which ended up on screen, it was still his script this mess came from & quite frankly how much difference could there have been?
Perhaps they were hoping to find (or save) the center of Jordan's muddled plot, but in the end it's still a wash-out.
(Spoiler: Why the scientist was shot in one potential futures by an alien is still puzzling).
The other type ("Riders of Destiny" and "the Star Packer," for example) are still quite entertaining 75 years later.
It looks good, while it's still.
I had to watch the first movie over again, just to cleanse my palate, but I'm still in mourning.
Babe is still as sweet as ever just matures as his ignorance fades away.
Anyway, now that that rant is over, Average Joe was an entertaining enough show, but it just proved that all the stereotyping dating philosophies apparently still hold true.
overall, its still watchable, but unfortunately so many difficult stereotypes were confirmed that it really reflected badly on the state of dating in America
No wonder why he went all out in the final twenty minutes, but this creature could've been mistaken for a machine since all of the punishment it encounters and still it doesn't bleed.
Demon of Paradise is a terrible film, it's dull, boring, badly made & just painful to sit through (I still have the emotional scars to prove it).
When the kids finally do realize that Lizzie is still in the asylum, they have moments of panic, then they revert back to their druggy horseplay, then another panic, then horseplay, then panic again.
The questions were mind-numbingly dumb (as was the commentary), if anything it makes you realise why the Sept 11 campaigners still haven't been able to prove a single one of their allegations.
The nightmares still linger in my head about this, truly the worst film that I ever saw.
However, HORROR OF THE BLOOD MONSTERS proves that this genre of bad films was still alive and twitching!
Adamson is the man responsible for "Dracula vs. Frankenstein" (1971), easily one of the worst films I'd ever seen, and I still hadn't forgiven him for that awful evening.
The acting is  poor, especially Ralph Byrd (if he stood still for a moment, he'd be  attacked by a woodpecker).
  OK, just saw the movie (rented it, thank god I didn't spend more than 2'50 Euros on this thing) and hey, can't remember the last time I saw something sooooo bad... Oh, and if someone got what the hell is going on, I'll be glad to know it... my sister and I are still discussing our views on what we have just seen...
I will say though this movie is obviously set up as a comedic fun-ride and not to be taken seriously for a second, the underling messages of homophobia and violence against kids still is very disturbing.
Jezz what are they trying to make a movie or a bad version of the Excorsit  Well thats all I have to say if you still want to watch it be my guest but bollywood needs creativity.
But still, I will rate this movie good, because it is of one of the first and boldest attempts to revolutionize the trash-can Bollywood stories and movies.
However, this piece of crap still sits steaming away in the *beep* pile (like crap does).
The movie ends with voice-overs, still pictures and rehashed footage.
Unfortunately, they still managed to screw it up.
Just when you think it's over, you see that there is one cannibal still alive which implies the real horror of a sequel.
This still ranks FAR below "Borderland"   My Grade: C-
It addresses a topic that is still untouched, in horror films at least, and is able to play off of human nature quite well.
Even if this movie was free to rent, I still wouldn't rent it!
The acting was par for a children's film - not as bad as Tim Allen in "Shaggy Dog", but still not on the level of an adult's film.
These have simply been "translated" for us, where necessary, or conveyed to us "as is" when they still make scatological sense today.
One final note: the climax, although still good, was pieced together in such a way that it did not hold the tension enough for the theater audience.
Greta is an astonishingly trained dog, but her skills are still underused and the script at one point even reveals that black magic is responsible for her turning into a merciless killing machine.
Films for children would still be more clever.
The people of the future still understand this too.
Though we gave it a relatively low rating of four (4) stars**** it is still worth a watch at least once.
No, HAINES still comes off as a 'Prissy Ham' with none of the charm he showed in SHOW PEOPLE (1928), the first of his films we had seen.
This is David Hasselhof a person that is still on the T.V.
That was still too much to pay.I hope you never have the depressed shock to shoot a movie and have your voice looped without your permission or notice.There's nothing like the feeling of being laughed at by movie goers in Norway.
You're still not even close to how nasty it sounds.
Take it from me just don't bother, I began watching it, thought, yeah not so good but maybe it will pick up, no, an hour in, nothing happens, still no sign of any plot, comedy, I then did something more interesting like watch someone else watch paint dry.
Some of this may be a little preposterous, even goofy, but Bob Shaye and his team bypass the obvious but still perilous pit-falls for filmmakers investing themselves into children's movies.
When Banek traces Gipson, however, and asks him to return the document, Gipson, still angry about the collision and about the outcome of his own court case, refuses.
The stylish intro of "Der Wixxer" was quite good, so I still kept my fingers crossed for the movie, but the movie degraded from minute to minute.
- you'd see a parody of the Edgar Wallace series, very low budget - well: cheap - German crime movies from the early 60ies that still get some admiration for their tackiness and camp value.
I still can't understand why these four totally different girls would go on a road trip together, none the less know each other.
You could set them on the moon and they would still fascinate.
They have literally soiled their nest so badly that they could go to another planet and they would still be that talentless band who were given everything and chose to rub it in everyone's faces.
I knew almost nothing about the Pixies before watching loudQUIETloud, and now having seen it, I still feel as though I know nothing about them.
Okay, it's nothing a friend should do to cheat on his best friend with his wife - but hey, feelings sometimes make us do things that are not really clever, but still that's what feelings are there for in a way... and since it always takes two persons to cheat on a third one, I really could not understand what this movie wanted to express in the end.
I make the aforementioned statement comparably to the director's other films off course, as this one is still quite watchable in it's own right.
And that's really disappointing, because when I first heard about it, before there was a trailer, before the characters were nailed down, when they were still talking about one of the Olsen sisters as an actress, I was thinking this film was going to be great.
Not the best actors, not the best plot, not the best anything really... still it's quite O.K.
I have no idea how well this is gonna do at the box office, although Amber Heard's constant nudity will certainly catch some attention and give her lots of job offers (too bad her acting skills are still rather poor).
Multi-layered narratives can work but weak trivial garbage on top of trivial garbage is still ... well you can work it out.
And some still do.
The movie cannot has 1/10, since it has still one funny part: "Oh Silvia!..."
The truth is you know all this already, and although I feel a slight guilt that I don't surrender my free time to the discussion of more pressing matters such as those aforementioned, I still cannot allow myself to let the memory of Feed pass without discussion.
I suppose that he's not supposed to be a street cop, but it's still inexcusable.
I suppose that he's not supposed to be a street cop, but it's still inexcusable.
I saw this movie for free and I still paid too much.
In the last weeks of his life he had been drinking very heavily and went home where the tubercolar meningitis and alcoholism caught up with him but he still insisted that Jeanne give him more to drink.
The film (if not its subject's life) is a catalogue of clichÃ©s: The miserable childhood, the penniless adulthood, the difficult love life, the threat of insanity, the critical incomprehension, the refusal to 'sell out' (possibly the most long-lived of romantic clichÃ©s, it's still thought to be relevant in the world of rock and roll) and the god-damned post mortem vindication are all present and accounted for.
If a director, producer, and/or screenwriter rely too much on lazy re-caps, re-usage of images, and "specials" based on re-used and re-edited scenes; then one wonders why people like them have been hired or are still employed.
There are a couple almost funny moments, like one teen losing his virginity to the girl of his dreams, while she's being attacked by raccoons....the realization of her plight while he's still busy is probably the highlight of the movie, such as it is.
The main character just die because the film need him to die at the end in order to continue the stupid script,if he's still alive, audience will not cry and the movie will not have the strong impact on audience.
Believe me, i have seen many bad Korean movies and i still accept it if it can help me chase my boredom for a while,but this movie is just nonsensical, it makes me wonder how can a director can make a movie this bad!
while she's gone the girl working at this cafe along with just about every other girl in the universe, makes a play for him but he can't forget his bitchy annoying girlfriend he still loves for some inexplicable reason.
so then all these not by any means terrible looking but nowhere near as darling as the star of the picture guys make the scene, by this time I'm really quite honestly watching at +1 speed at which I can still read the subtitles.
I hope that hot doll face makes lots more movies though, he was awesome... better still why doesn't he just come to America and sweep me off my feet.
Though I found Pixar's earlier work to be more enjoyable and humorous, such as their shorts from Toy Story 1 and A Bugs Life, it still was fun to watch and suitable for all ages.
It had many built in messages, most of the hidden ones recognized by the older audience, but children still get the same type of impression of what is going on and why the outcast, goofy looking bird was left out of the group of all the other birds that looked alike, because children start to build social groups at younger ages than what most people would think.
Why shouldn't we expect global temperatures to increase since we are still coming out of the last Ice Age?
I really wonder why movies like this still come out.
But the characters of the movie, most of them men, are such losers and are so repulsive that a PG-rated version would still look bizarre and something about it would seem askew.
Hollyoakes still runs despite my best efforts so.....
That's one of the reasons I watched it, though hesitant, I still viewed it anyway.
In fact I still found the movie hard to watch despite Murray's performance.
Micah is still in jail, but has a new buddy - Christian Slater, playing Finch.
This is what the original film did so well and why it is still remembered so fondly.
It would still do well even today and would fit right in with today's society.
The acting is horrible, the camera quality is equally terrible, and I'm still not sure if I even fully understand the plot.
I was a little young when I watched it, but still, it was entertaining.
Of course the budget in Full Metal Yakuza was much smaller than in those mentioned films, but still the film doesn't offer any significant achievements of its director, other than the typical ultra violence and silliness.
We still had miscegenation laws in most states at the time so the message of sticking to your own kind was in keeping with 1939 mores.
Now if the casting of Austrian-born actress in the lead was the only problem, the movie still could have been interesting.
The head of security at the party is an ex-cop friend of the PI, and the PI also has a friend still in the department.
Though I'm still on the fence, I really detested this film.
The first one was deep and twisted and really made you think about the world and colliding realities, it was such an inspiring film and it still gives me a cold shiver thinking about that little girl saying 'you can't save me, you can only save yourself'..
Boogeyman 2 is the sequel to one of the worst horror films I have seen during the last 10 years.This sequel is better than the first part...but it also is a pathetic crap.Besides the good presence from Tobin Bell and ReneÃ© O' Connor,there is nothing to recommend in Boogeyman 2.The screenplay is horribly bad,the characters are completely generic and the movie is tremendously tedious from its first scene to its last one.Jeff Betancourt,who was the editor of some very competent movies (like The Good Girl or The Ruins),made his first work as a director in this movie,and it would be better if he goes back to editing movies,because the direction from Boogeyman 2 is pathetic for many reasons,but mainly,because it never finds a good tone and it is very chaotic.Boogeyman 2 belongs to the worst kind of horror cinema and I suggest you to avoid this big piece of crap.As I said,it's better (or,more properly,less bad) than the first part,but it's still unbearable and painful to watch.
Kurt eventually married Mylee and they are still there partying today.
Just Kurt and Eric who are still living it up in Thailand.
Why are we still accepting adequate films today?
In a way, I still am.
But still up to today, freaks are hunting autographed stuff or OOP flicks from her.
I will admit that this is a very atmosphere flick but the whole movie still falls flat on its face.
It seems that the director of the movie (Luigi Cozzi) still loves to have people having their organs blown to pieces.
This is not my attempt to completely bash the film , I will also add that there were some good musical parts and dance sequences but still the movie couldn't keep me or others watching the movie glued to the screen or even interested.
Even if you force a laugh, you still feel annoyed.
Movies just like it are still being made, and they're still getting acclaim.
That's something directors/writers obviously didn't get back in the 70s, and it's something they still don't get today.
and still holds up quite nicely as a savage black comedy of words, forever a monument to the man as a writer and director.
They could have used the best actors in the world (which they certainly did not), and the "story" still would have dragged this down.
  Standard, and worthless, sequel to standard original has Hewitt back as Julie James, who is still haunted by the events of the original.
I should have (still) known or remembered what a poor movie the first 'Summer' was.
'I still know' makes the original seem like a classic.
Jennifer Love Hewitt is certainly easy on the eye and Im sure she has more talent than the filmmakers allowed her in 'I still know' Shes pretty much reduced to walking around aimlessly wearing as many low-cut, two sizes too small T-shirts as the makers can cram into an hour and a half of film.
Julie shot the man like 7 times and he still has enough energy to not die, follow her to her house, crawl under a chair (like he would fit), and then pull her under it!
Willis apparently found out where Julie lives and where she goes to school.Immediately,he goes to get his son out of nowhere and gets him to go to the same school and make friends with Julie.Then he fakes a radio show(I think)and lets Julie and her roommate,played by Brandy of all people,win it by guessing the capital of Brazil(to win a trip to the Bahamas,is this still making sense to you?
When they arrive,turns out it's the rain season.Why would a radio station give people tickets to the Bahamas in the rain season?Can't they just like,call the station and try to change the date or something?Freddie Prinze Jr.(he has a name,but unlike Ben,I don't still know)also heads for the Bahamas right after waking up from a coma or something to save the day and he kills Ben once and for all,after Ben killed his own son by accident,cos he apparently never watched pro-wrestling.
This movie is utterly insane,but amazingly,I still don't like it.It's just hard to enjoy a movie about Jennifer Love Hewitt not being killed I guess.
I read The SPOILERS*   Julie James (Jennifer Love Hewitt, who is as one-expressioned and scenery-chewer in this as she is in 'Ghost Whisperer') has changed college from the first movie, and is still obsessed with The Fisherman (Muse Watson, who has been given way better material in 'Prison Break' and 'NCIS'), who pays her a visit in the Campus' Disco (hey, Fishermen just wanna have fun!).
At the end we had to check on the internet the duration of the movie because we were sure a part were missing... but actually not,  ;-) So to summarize, here we go, a sexy girl from a town want to be an actress, and once her boyfriend cheat on her, she and her best friend go to Madrid and spend all their money, buying clothes, making new tits... then she is sad because she can't be an actress so go to her boy friend, and once the figure out that he is still seeing the girl he cheat on her with she go back to Madrid crying, that's more o less the whole movie.
I'm still trying to figure it out.
We cut to a flashback of her introducing the two of them to each other, just in case we still don't get it.
I would chuckle if I did not feel sorry for everyone still playing.
Even though new races and weapons have been added to the Warcraft series it still gets boring and annoying.
He's still annoying, still dumb, still unfunny.
At the end of the day Pauly still hasn't learned his lesson.
You know you are in trouble when a film includes John Goodman, Eddie Griffin, Harvey Firestein and Michael McKean (and a scene-stealing Carol Kane) and is still dull.
Sure it has problems: the plot's kind of dopey, the audience is always ahead of the characters, David Schwimmer's still irritating (though oddly, in a completely way to usual) but enough of it worked to satisfy me.
It is rare that a film can possesses such a fine display from one of the co-stars in Elijah Wood, but still ends up a total disappointment.
The other characters are just as they are in the games; Tails is the mechanic who idolizes Sonic, Amy lets anger get in the way of reason, Knuckles is the cynic, Rouge has large breasts, and Shadow still makes me want to bash my own skull against a brick wall with his ridiculous "badass" attitude.
I have been a sonic fan ever since the old genesis games and I am still a sonic fan.
Brian DePalma, not anywhere to be found on my favorite director's list, really did a top-notch job with the first movie...if people complained that the first movie was too hard to understand, they will be pleased to know that the second movie throws not only logic out the window, but also any sense of adventure, suspense or fun...it's a big disappointment...i can't think of anything else to say because i am still dumbfounded by how LAME this movie is.
(Wouldn't it have been better if they just attacked the HQ with commandos etc)  In the original film Ethan Hunt gets promoted to Jim Phelps rank within the organisation but in the sequel he is still a "Point man" jumping around in commando gear.
Not far off from a talking heads movie, yet the conversations were slow enough that even if the movie involved gunfire they'd still be boring.
Meanwhile, we're treated to the most god-awful stereotypes of human beings: a whiny and neurotic single gal, Jersey girl snobs--with accents to match, a morose poet type, punk rockers, a cute but dumb bartender, two best friends (one of which always sleeps with the other's boyfriends--and yet they're still best friends), a handsome young man who has the curse of women falling all over him, and, worst of all, the wise and flawed Black person to offer commentary on all these white people.
It might be creatively written, it might have been done a nice small budget, but I still can't give the movie much praise.
The fact the film still today remains banned in the UK, is not due in any respect to any offencive material, but due I'm sure to the fact that no distributor can be bothered to resubmit the film to the BBFC.
One of the infamous video nasties that were banned in Britain, this one known as Forest of Fear, is still banned.
Both cartoons are still child-oriented, neither really is great, neither is very artistic, and neither really transcends the child/family genre to appeal truly to people of all ages.
I still cant actually get over the boy with the horns hahahahaha.
Even if your not a western fan this show might still be for you.
The only reason I gave this movie 2 out of 10 instead just 1 is because I found acting pretty solid and good old "jumpy" effects a la John Carpenter copied pretty well (like she is walking back and bumping into someone - simple but still scary).
I find two things fascinating about this movie forty years out:  (1) what passed for sexually suggestive or titillating once upon a time, which still has some fetishistic appeal (pay attention to Nancy Sinatra's scenes).
And worst yet, the basic story concept, of the internal conflict felt by a bright young woman who can write winning popular music, in an era still as stuffy as Mamie Eisenhower's tea parties ... was a most intriguing concept.
My eyes still hurt.
Julius was my hoops hero at the time (still is in some ways), and I was major-league embarrassed for him.
Oh gosh, and why does every young lost love story have to include an ex-lover that committed suicide (simone's ex lover that she still mourns for) ...
She is still one hell of a funny lady but what she saw in this film besides a paycheck is an enigma wrapped inside of a riddle embedded in a mystery.
Only good point is a white-black romance without any eyebrow raising or racism (made in 1993) and we still (2008) haven't had many of those in theatres).
Then the Mold, an evil character from Irena's past, performed by an excellent Michele Placido, who was killed by a giant scissor that would have killed an elephant, is still alive and comes back in Irena's life.
Even if he did not kill all of the people that he claimed to, he is still a degenerate who has still killed.
Henry is still at large after his initial killing spree and homeless.
Children of today could still probably have fun watching this, but even for adults addicted to silent films, like myself, it may be too childish.
Halfway through I was wondering why I was still watching this.
It's possible, but 13 years on I still have flashbacks to the ridiculous sheep-like noise which echoed through the room every time the main character had a personality change...  Who can forget the looks on the faces of my fellow movie watchers who moved straight past blaming the film itself for being so bad to blaming me for renting it.
I can still feel the stabbing pain of their dagger laden looks....the "Well...I'm going home" which was 'overlooked', simply for a swift and silent exit from my house.
I have seen this movie 5 times and I still cannot come up with an answer to a question a friend of mine had.
Polanski's masterpiece is still the gold-standard by which fright flicks are judged--40 years after its release.
Reese, I still think you are on top of your game, and this was ten years ago during your indie phase, so I don't hold you accountable, just please don't let it happen again.
Although it might be understandable given the format and the low budget, it still is quite bad.
Reese, I still think you are on top of your game, and this was ten years ago during your indie phase, so I don't hold you accountable, just please don't let it happen again.
I still have a bad taste in my mouth from watching it 4 years ago.
Time actually seemed to stand still as we watched and we actually started thinking "a rousing game of chess would be fun" it became blatantly clear that not only was this film a total waste of time, but it was pure crap as well.
We all have stumbling blocks along the way, but I still want the hour or so of my life back...
But I am sure I would have liked the movie when I was a kid so maybe there is still hope for this movie for some age group but for those that are older then 14 or around that age and know the movie culture at some level will see those many flaws is this flick.
it makes me think that people are still searching for that dare to be unemployed situation because if anyone ever try's to sell this they will surely end up in the unemployed section of the world because of traumatic reasons.
I'm still wondering who ever told these Asylum people they are movie makers.
Attack of the Killer Refrigerator is like 15 minutes long and still better than this one.
By the end, I still didn't know much of the plot, but I didn't walk away completely empty.
I will give the film its due in that it is trying to be an arty scifi movie with more flair than pure scifi.But still, something thats that hard to follow just cant be appealing.
None the less, the idea of a hundred teenaged Xeroxes of Der Fuehrer set to "go off" around the Globe is still a concept that seems to have come out of an episode of "Get Smart", as does the whacky script.
Her Hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the Paul Verhoeven movie "Showgirls", so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies- and television series like this one.
Paul Greenberg was in the Vacant Lot, a highly underrated show that I still don't get all of.
I still like him as a bit player, but he's proven that he definetly can't carry a film.
And another thing, I find it depressing that in this day and age they still try to use the laugh track as a cue to where the "funny stuff" is supposed to be.
Johnson is at least still baby faced enough to pull off the High School look but her and Smith have zero chemistry as soul mates and best friends.
Back at his Castle he finds Alys is still the housekeeper, Victor picks up where his Father left off by having sex with her on a regular basis.
While certainly not in the same league as the legendary Cushing, Bates still manages to bring much to the role, playing the evil doctor as a supremely confident, smug and single-minded type.
It is based on a true story, but still this movie is boring.
As the story continues it gets even more depressing plot wise but SIN AND REDEMPTION still failed to hold my attention except to make ask how can one woman be so unlucky in life ?
maybe the estranged retarded cousin of the crap family, but still in it.
I am so disappointed but still giving it 3 out of 10.
Unfortunately reasonable production values still don't save it from being conceptually awful & a complete total utter mess.
By the way, Donald Duck is still 100 times better.
I had a feeling when i rented this movie i may not like it because of all the horrible straight to DVD movies these days.It reminded me a lot of the movie "room 6" that came out a year earlier.Literally the exact same plot in almost the exact same screwed up hospital which no longer existed.Hallucinations and weird nurses running rampant as some chic is trying to escape encountering other weird patients who are trapped.Finally some soul ripping creature dressed in a black cloak is killing off each patient in her dreams.This movie makes no sense.There is no way to tell what is really happening and it has no continuity.She wakes up from a nightmare to find out she's still in it.
Low budget films can still be pleasing to watch, but not this one.
I'm no expert in the world of trick photography, but still there has to have been some advances between "Attack of the Puppet People" and "Empire of the Ants."
At least, the thing is entertaining enough while it's on Â and I'd still like to check out director Gordon's other Wells adaptation, THE FOOD OF THE GODS (1976), eventually...
Now, if only someone reworked it and made it today, I bet Joan Collins is still available.....
Yeah, I knew it involved a girl and her horse, but still, I was open-minded, plus my date wanted to see it.
and an impossibly perfect mom, but it still does not disappoint.
Daniel Bernhardt, still in his action man prime, is also wasted and of course when he fights Chuck, the simple fact that they are filmed to hide Chucks double and Chucks lack of speed, Bernhardt can't do much.
is still kicking away and if this is any indication of what we should expect from Chuck Norris for the next couple of years, perhaps it's not such a bad idea that he peddles total gym commercials.
Well, he's back at it alive and kicking (unwitting pun) here, duking it out with smaller time fellow fighting star Daniel Bernhardt, but that The Cutter would still be less fun than BOI even in spite of this should speak volumes.
Other than this it would be hard to respect it for very much today, but it is still easy to enjoy it on its own terms as a totally zany romantic comedy with a story in which anything goes.
We can still share much of this fun today!
While it's of infinitely better quality than the T&A show that is Ghost Whisperer (who would've thought skimpy outfits + ghost mysteries would actually be boring), I still was not impressed much by this show.
People hoping to learn about Italian politics from this movie will be disappointed, but it is still possible to gain a few insights.
In conclusion: coming from the director of "Caro Diario", this movie is a disappointment; but it might still be worth seeing, at least the first half.
I'm still trying to get my mind around why his hair was piled so high he looked like Elvis.
It's still early but I would be surprised if I saw a worse movie this year.
I am trying to fix a glaring error, which must be obnoxious to Una Stubbs who is still living, I hope and also to Dandy Nicholls, who may not be still living, but I remember watching as a child - but it may be to her family!
Even though events take different turns towards the end, she still doesn't learn anything new, and the movie remains with the same shallow thought that is started out with: spend more, take risks and you'll be happier.
In the end you find out there is a fish in a lake, the guy says Zah to scare people, the guy refuses to believe she is a witch till the very end (and frankly I still don't think he really believes), and both end up in the clutches of satan.
It still would have been a B-movie, but I don't think it would have been as painful.
It makes the mistake by starting up years after this event, where the witch lady is still as youthful as ever and has tricked a nice (if a tad bit dumb) guy to assist her.
Even watching on MST, it's still rough
But still....
I still would say, go see for yourself.
At this point I still had high hopes.
Once again the have an example of characters that are supposed to be in school, and still under their parents wing, but look to be pushing or over 30.
Despite everything I just mentioned, TERROR AT TENKILLER still retains some 80s trash charm.
The setting is still fairly interesting.
However, i still rented out this movie, thinking that being based on a Michael Crichton novel, it cannot be that bad.
  Oh, man....I finished watching this movie a couple of hours ago and I'm still laughing hysterically when I think about it.
Of course, I still respect the efforts that cast and crew put into this but you can't help but roll over the floor and laugh.
I am 50+, I belong to the rock generation, I love all kind of music and pretend to be a liberal, but rappers still are beyond my taste.
Furthermore the actors are so obviously playing to a camera and getting cues that even if the first 2 problems with the character depiction weren't there you'd still have the realism of the typical elementary school Christmass play.
They always persist in running off alone on pointless errands, instead of sticking together and overwhelming an often vulnerable looking killer (such as the "Redeemer" here) through the sheer force of a mass attack while they still have the advantage of superior numbers.
I expected very little, yet was somehow still disappointed.
Why would the two of them still be married?
and Maggie Q still hasn't become a house-hold name.
Despite working with crummy material, he still puts in a decent comedic performance as Feng, far outshining the other actors.
But still in patches in delivered one or two eerily, hasty scenes involving a graphic decapitation and trippy dream sequence.
This has a good cast with (a still looking good at 42) Joan Collins, Ralph Bates, Donald Pleasance and horror-eye-candy stalwart Caroline Munro.
Caroline Munroe also appears in a supporting role but that's still not a good enough reason to make this movie .
17 years later and I still shudder at the memory of having seen this in the theater.
i still dont know why i rented this silly movie.. Steve Martian was so weird in this one.. as was Bill Murray... what were these people thinking when they made this movie???
we still have their counterparts who try to keep 'cine mexicano' being as bad as it has been for so many years.
She previously used her breasts in "Deadly Weapons," actually smothering people to death; here, it's more standard, like garroting someone with a cord, though there's one scene involving ice cubes which is different, if still dull.
I know it's bad for me, and I still can't stop.
I saw this as "Alien Chaser," but it is still pretty bad.
If you haven't seen it and still want to, I wish you luck.
So you still have basically the same things going on with the girls (Galleria gets big headed and then humbled, Chanel struggles with parental problems, Dorinda enjoys dancing) with the addition of Aqua and her fashion thing.
But if you still decide to watch this film, the scenery is beautiful and Jason Robards sr. always a pleasure to watch.
Everything looks low-rent, which is cemented by its compact setting and stuffily framed direction but still lingering within is a grim atmosphere.
You may prepare yourself for the worst, and then still "The Terror Within" will surpass your most cautious expectations.
6)The film probably just took a few days to shoot; still I think George Kennedy had other, more urgent places to go to.
I have seen Travels three times and still think it's great fun.
I am still working out what the film was about and what was its cause.
OK it's the 80's but still.
The script and plot are pretty thin and you see quite a bit of nudity by women who frankly don't look very good naked--but still, the film is oddly watchable and the worm sequences are pretty cool!
People will CLEARly still be watching Deadwood in a hundred years -- probably still in a THOUSAND, if the species lasts that long.
Ivan Sandomire's performance, the music, and some externals (including the B&W still pictures) are good, but not strong enough to save the film.
Not as bleakly derivative and shoddy as one might expect, Candyman 2 is still not all that inventive, original, or good as well.
After repeated viewings, I still can't remember whodunit, not because it is so cleverly hidden from the viewer, but because the solution makes no sense at all.
I saw it on Turner Classic Movies, but I still want my money back.
Even if your not British and don't know who he is, it's still not gonna sit right.
I get the feeling the whole thing is devised and made by inexperienced, retired cage fighters still high on after show testosterone fuelled steroid binges.
The movie is still worth watching as every 14 year old boy's fantasy comes to life and love is not what it is all cracked up to be!
Had Jack lived he most likely would NOT have been re-elected as Goldwater was way ahead in the polls and the American public was still quite angry at the poor handling of Cuba and Kruschev!
Apart from how boring this was, it was also historically inaccurate (apart from Kennedy's assassination), but even still, setting this during that time frame is somewhat distracting.
They still did a segment every episode in which they folded laundry and traded one-liners... but now they were just miserable whining pigs.
It is still quite watchable, with plenty of heroics deeds, good production values and adequate acting for the genre.
It's also very bad history and bastardizes the story terribly, but is still much closer to the original source material than this silly film.
I think that while Richard Grieco might be good looking, he's still pretty much a cheese-puff!
Old men tend to make art that is shallow, imitative of their earlier, better works, and which would never garner an ounce of praise were it not for their backlog of greater works somehow letting their patina still rub off.
Fellini might take some solace in the fact that Intervista is a better film than Bergman's incest-ridden Saraband, but it's a minor comfort, at best, and this shoddy film still falls well shy of even Dreams.
It's only saving grace Is the actors, who understandably still work well together after all those years, even newcomers Rosario Dawson and whoever plays Joanne fit in nicely.
I rented this movie, since the awful (and yet still too kind) reviews kept me from wasting my $$$ at the theater.
Really not worth my time writing this, typically I'm the type that keeps negative opinions on films to myself because I still consider movies an artful expression.
What "art" there is in this movie is limited to still compositions.
Admittedly all these things have their artistic rhyme and reason, but they're still about as fun to watch as an elderly relative cutting their toenails.
In conclusion this film has very deservedly earned itself a position on the Bottom 100, and I'm still blown away by the fact that there are movies this irredeemably awful out there.
Even though I was just a dumb kid at the time, I could still tell the difference between a good piece of film-making and and a film so bad it hurts, but what is it about the movie that makes one hurt you ask?
however, the best part, and the element of the movie that still, 18years on remains unsurpassed for me, is the Goblin masks.
The watching itself may be painful, but it is ultimately worth the pain to be able to say, with conviction, "I survived 'Troll 2,' and I'm still technically alive."
ADDENDUM (October 2007): This is still the worst movie of all time.
However, while I loved and still love Lewis' 1960s gore films, "Taste of Blood" is EASILY the weakest effort in the Lewis horror library.
As of 2009, Herschell Gordon Lewis is still the master of Gore.
In fact, I'd place it in the top half of his films for quality--though it still isn't that great.
This film is full of great characters, who are rounded out into real people,and despite any flaws in them, they were all still likable.
I saw this film when it came out in the theater 23 years ago and I'm still mad about the $4.50 I paid and the precious 83 minutes of my life that I will never get back.
I saw this over 20 years ago and still remember.
However, it still was a terrible movie.
But it still remains a curious and strange gem.
But here's an interesting contradiction: Not much really happens in this movie, but still there's a lot going on (just remember the previous things I mentioned).
I have to say, although this film was badly executed, it still had a cool storyline and a lot of potential.
It also never portrayed the conflict of Rock 'n' Roll music: jazz music was still popular at the time.
It was 15 years ago, and the event is still fresh in my mind.
This being a funnier story than a lot of others that I had seen, it's in league with "The Secret of My Success" "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure" a lesser talented "Tootsie" but still very much a fun and wacky teenage tale of ' investigative mischief '.
This is fun and will be loved by some liked by others and not thought of still by some more.
And so free from visiting friends and amusement parks and not wanting to waste the evening looking at four walls of a motel room or watch the novelty of 24hour TV (remember this was 1981 and TV in the UK still closed at around midnight) I ventured out to the local Cinema to watch "Agency".
If you ever get the chance to see this film do yourself a favour - lock yourself in your house and throw the keys out of the window, tape up your eyes, plug your ears or better still stay in your room and look at four blank walls.
Though this movie is still watchable, it doesn't even come near the brilliance of the original.
Predictable and somewhat overreaching family-oriented drama shoehorns in Kevin Costner as the father of two of the central good kids; he's just back from Vietnam and still hears the choppers, but we know he's in big trouble once he puts everything on the line to take a dangerous mining job.
If you like your drama to be slightly slower than normal, then this may be for you, but even those who appreciate thought provoking over action will still be bored senseless by this absolute tripe.
Seems like the filmmakers in Sacramento are still trying to ride the coattails of Blood, Guts, and Octane.
Then, she made FOXY BROWN--a very similar film but still very watchable nonetheless.
It's predictable, but still fun is to be had here.
Caricatures abound with clear labels as to who should be hissed and who should be cheered by any audience member still awake.
Before reading the comments here I didn't know this little misogynist comedy won an important award in some foreign country, and I still don't understand what makes it a winner.
I am still wondering how I managed to sit through the entire movie.
Sometimes and with some issues we provincial Americans are wrong...in this case, however, I suspect the French have something to learn from us about the way we have taken sexual abuse cases more seriously in recent years (though, of course, we still have a way to go).
I know that is the point the film makers intended, but that still doesn't mean I have to like it.
It's the only time I recall seeing Jack Carson playing a dramatic part, although he still had some sarcastic lines that were apparently supposed to inject a bit of humor - inappropriate in this movie.
Even viewed as a film of its time, it's still not very amusing.
Of course, watched in an ironic kind of way this slab of pure cheese can still produce a wry smile.
But i still love their music.
I suppose this movie was amusing, but still, the word that describes it best is "annoying".
Is this enough text, I wonder... Nope, still not enough.
This movie is clearly stupid and mindless yet still mildly entertaining.
He makes his films simple yet still entertaining.
So for those still searching, here is the answer.
If only places like "Ajax" (Telluride) still existed today with it's good friends, good tunes, and good times.
I've watched this video over and over and still find myself singing along, reciting my favorite lines, and discovering more of it's charm each time.
of all the times that i've watched scrapple (some 100) in all kinds of venues (at 3 in the morning on a couch with other bar stragglers, at new york film festivals), nothing compared to seeing it in its hometown at mountain film festival, with a hometown crowd as they whooped and yelped at all the local references, ski town tributes and cameo performances (all of which still has appeal to broader less tuned-in audiences).
ten years down the road -- and still going strong -- scrapple has endured as a classic, and judging from last week's screening, it continues to mark a time, not only in skitown history, but as a way of life still worth celebrating.
It's still a lot better than the first movie though.
I found the first one to be complete garbage, while this is still at least somewhat entertaining at times.
dominik moll tried to make a thriller, but I guess he still have to learn.
I'm still searching why Charlotte Gainsbourg changed her mind for around 45-60 minutes in the movie.
Having said that, I'm still trying to understand the level of praise heaped upon this film.
Although Celestino's focus on obsessive behavior was clear, it still remains a rather typical story with typical outcomes.
Not only was Jackie better when he was younger, he still IS better and he is more than twice the age of the stars of this movie!
It would have been best if Chan were still alive and be able to serve as the comic relief.
4) 15 years after the "Lucky Stars" series, Eric Tsang is still providing the same kind of lame-brained "comic relief".
The whole I'm an ex- CIA agent, whose still really working for the CIA - shhhh don't tell anyone got old after Mission Impossible 1 and stinks here about as much as MI3 does.
Don't get me wrong Steven, I am a fan and this is my 2nd worst movie from you and I hope you will comeback in a movie where it is better than this but I still hated this movie for the rest of my life.
The car chase, some decent gunfights and the presence of character actor Timothy Carhart elevate this above a one, but it is still very, very poor.
As with Streetcar Named Desire, I've seen this twice now, and still can't say I'd recommend it, except for James Michael Bobby (the Cowboy) as its seductive, off-kilter Blanche Dubois.
Whether he's pursuing his fate by lolling, cavorting, or chopping wood in desert heat, the Cowboy is an odd, heartfelt portrayal of a tender, lost boy on the edge of crazy, especially in scenes with Elyse Mirto as the crazy, lost Mrs. who's still tender, despite being crazed by Gregory Christian as her manipulative, cowardly, deceitful Hubby (imagine Jeff Goldblum without charm).
Hubby's fantasy is that he can stuff married respectability down his wife's throat and still have a piece of its expected decency to tempt the Cowboy.
You will be moved to tears to see that God is still Alive and well and watching over His own.
I still don't know what it was all about despite the "helpful" explanatory subtitles on the DVD.
The mass persecution of Christians still goes on, and many are continuing to lose their lives and their freedom, simply because they are Christians.
Now obviously, the filmaker is going to try to make you lean one way in your decicion, but you still get to make a decision, you feel that you've been informed on all sides and get to choose an appropriate belief in some idea that the movie is about.
Just to think that such things even still go on today around the world, is a painful reality.
and selecting a capable cast, the entire effort was shot in the head when it came time for the script - not to mention some model sequences which, in spite of emerging technology, still just flat don't 'work.'
For those of you in the States find a Veteran and ask him about the truth, while there is still time?
Good Western in which the Reno gangs raid bank ,treasure offices ,train,robberies in post-civil war Indiana.Stylish,fast paced,solid ,meticulous and a violent look with numerous shootouts.Randolph Scott leaving times ago the secondaries roles as when he was still playing supporting roles in top films as Â¨Jesse JamesÂ¨(Henry King), Â¨Virginia cityÂ¨(Michael Curtiz) and Â¨the spoilers'(Ray Enright).Scott also played an famed outlaw in Â¨Doolins of OklahomaÂ¨(Gordon Douglas).The support cast make equally notable performances.
I still think we should confiscate Italy's entire supply of blank film, just as a precaution.
However, if you are gay or, especially, lesbian, you should have quite a few problems with this movie since there is a homicidal lesbian depicted (not an altogether ugly portrait, but still...).
A nation that had just fought a major conflict and still had weapons and trained soldiers was simply a fact of life.
The sight of old, wrinkly people stepping in and out of bathtubs does make me shiver, but it's still not the type of horror I anticipate to see on film.
It is uncomfortable watching a character who is so out of her depth, while the Nanny in the book grew up in that society, yet could still see the ridiculousness of it.
Then the movie came out, it suffered from bad reviews and low ticket sales, so my hope that the movie would be as good as the book were dampened, but I was still interested in it.
But "Bad Moon" still is nothing else but a normal horror film with little creeps.
These films may have been crudely made but at least they were a realistic interpretation of the Afro-American way of life at a time when white America was still laughing at Stepin' Fechit.
Let's start with the premise: a girl (freedom fighter/terrorist) becomes impregnated by a wounded "brother in arms" while they find themselves hiding from the government troops in a ditch (and the latter are still raiding the area, might I add).
I'm still waiting for some good movie or show about the revelation.
That being said, I could win $10,000,000 in the lottery, be jumping for joy, and "Full of Life" would still be a stinker.
Richard Thomas is pretty good - although he still looks about 25 and as if he just wandered off the set of The Waltons.
We're back in the desert, only a few miles away from the initial tragedy that overcame the Carlton family, and the cannibals (including the charismatic creep Michael Berryman) are still lurking around.
Somehow Pluto (Michael Berryman) is still alive after the first movie.
Michael Berryman is still good as Pluto (though the character is nowhere near as scary as he was in the first film).
The movie starts the same as "Texas Chainsaw Massacre II" with a prologue that tells what happened in the previous movie and reminds us that "the hills still have eyes".
and still remembers how she almost kills Pluto.
Anyways, the gang returns to the hills (duh) and one by one these kids are killed by Pluto (still as ugly as in the original, or even uglier!
The potentially cool bits are the only saving grace of this one, but its still about 95 plus percent useless so Id say avoid.
Her Hollywood career is as good as over after appearing in the Paul Verhoeven movie "Showgirls", so unfortunately she will probably only still appear in movies- and television series like this one.
Is Jennifer still alive & will Hope be able to find help?
You know, to be honest I was sitting there watching Broken & I was just thinking to myself when Hope slashed the back of that guy's leg but he still had her back didn't he realise things were not going to work out?
Even then she still has problems: an overbearing boss, a fruitcake mother, a totally anal boyfriend, and a bitchy co-worker.
And, for the record, I still watch 'It's A Wonderful Life', though many have gotten sick of it, sad to say.
In accordance with the campy aura, the film's main focus are a group of teenagers who hang out together, and whose camaraderie is indicative of such films, and could still be an inspiration.
I watched it twice and still wondering if it's made by the same group that did the first movie.
It's a good thing they want to have a princess instead of a prince, but it's easy to tell the plot is still highly underneath Kovu.
There's still lots of conflict like Simba's daughter gets into trouble and stuff.
Ow silly me I'm still typing.
Because even for several years after his death, he kept on appearing in tiny horror productions like as if he was still amongst the living.
The only point of this intro is to make clear that the events take place on an island where the natives still practice the voodoo religion and that they're capable to do supernatural things.
Nearly forty years old at the time it was made, Tongolele still possessed a knockout figure and sexy aura.
Belgrade is thorn apart by war and neglected and lot of people still isn't recovered from Milosevic's regime.
The story is rather old yet this type of movie can still make for a good popcorn film.
Harrison Ford is over 60 years old yet he's still a better action star than some people in their 30s.
In true Macguyver style, Harrison still manages to steal the dough using part of a fax machine and his daughter's iPod!
Belgrade is thorn apart by war and neglected and lot of people still isn't recovered from Milosevic's regime.
Had you asked me in 1998 would this show been still running in 2006 I would have said definitely not.
But to my surprise the three writers who make up half of the Hole in the wall gang are still going strong.
Yes it is stereotypical and two dimensional but this show still has a large fan base throughout Ireland.
I managed to watch this tragical attempt, but I'm still considering claiming a health damage insurance.
If USA still ran their "Up All Night" showcase of B-Movies I would have watched it and enjoyed it thoroughly.
The fight sequences are still good to look at.
And like the rest of us I dont like to lower my standerds once a a while for pop-corn movies that arent very good but still have some entertainment value.
Christopher Lambert, while not being an excellent actor, was still VERY cool in the first Mortal Kombat.
I watched the original Mortal Kombat when I was about 10 years old, and it was bloody brilliant to me back then, it's still "ok" not absolute garbage, unlike its sequel.
But it is still a long way away.
It makes absolutely no sense, and thinking about it still makes me laugh.  
We who haven't left the room yet are saying "no", but oh boy do we still get a fun surprise.
Do yourself a favor and just watch the original, and if you still crave more, go play the games.
How on Earth can you get such a bunch of wooden actors together and still manage to hide all the strings?
Everything you could expect from a made-for-TV natural catastrophe movie is present and accounted for, so much so that even a few minor tweaks here-and-there still render it indistinguishable from the usual early Sunday-morning drivel.
Ivan, The Axeman is a ridiculous unstoppable killing machine who is stabbed numerous times, shot in the back numerous times, pinned to a stone wall by a truck going really fast, & even falls off a mountain..yet, he still keeps coming!
Gisella is also being black-mailed by someone in her inner circle(..of the remaining still alive).
I know you can still menace, can still show depth, can still out-act the handsome rockjaws and the grotesque Brody's every bit as well as Rush or F.Murray ....  No one will see your fine work here- and I'm sure you know that too.
I won't say anything more about what's in this movie, but during a time when Neil Armstrong put his foot on the moon, the success of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was still strong, and there was a cold war (see the opening cartoon for what I mean), MOON ZERO TWO was slapped together to cash in on all of it.
It obviously won't stand comparisons with the likes of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968), though still valuable for being one of the very first films to exploit the 1969 landing on the moon.
Having said that, It's undeniably superior to ZETA ONE (1969), which I watched recently, though still containing a definite camp factor Â starting with the goofy animated credit sequence (accompanied by a decidedly infectious title tune) but extending to hilarious costumes and propsÂnot to mention the presence of a dapper megalomaniac villain (by the way, as was the case with ZETA ONE itself, the cast features a member of the "Carry On" gang in Bernard Bresslaw, again, appearing as a baddie albeit a dimwitted brute!).
It's interesting, though, that co-star Adrienne Corri would appear in Hammer's more traditional VAMPIRE CIRCUS (though still contriving a twist in its tail) and Kubrick's subsequent piece of sophisticated sci-fi, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, within the same year (1971).
I've seen plenty of stupid and utterly worthless slasher flicks,but "Fatal Pulse" manages to be the worst of them all(still I need to see "Blood Lake" and "The Last Slumber Party").It's extremely routine and offers zero surprises.The plot is simple:a black-gloved killer is knocking off sorority sisters...The acting is awful,the gore is non-existent and the killings are lame(the victims are strangled,electrocuted,etc.
Oh this movie had so much potential and I still recommend it as the soundtrack rocks and Robbin and Tim are both beautiful and so lovely to watch, but....this is an example, to me, of a good movie just made too fast or something, I was bummed because it just has such great potential, there were just way way way too many inconsistencies and unbelievable situations... i.e.
Complete with a false blond, French-styled womanizer sporting a thin mustache, cozy police inspector John Hannah who appallingly enough gets the (false) blond, in stark competition with, yes folks, a Hollywood movie star version of an American WWII fighter pilot (from Brooklyn), still in his leather jacket!
Here are no mysteries at all, just cannibalizing on a famous brand name, still selling heaps of untampered paperbacks to be found in most bookstalls.
Despite top-notch performances in Short Cuts and The Funeral he's still paying the bills with straight-to-video 'entertainment' like this derivative turkey.
Ditto Michael Madsen - there's actually a scene where the two sit quietly facing each other, presumably lost in thought over why they're still paying their agents.
The first Ultimate Avengers, while not perfect, was still a solid introduction to the characters, their dynamics and their personal issues.
It still is fitting: this movie is definitely a "Mess", if not a "Fine" one.
Tim still the loser and the wonderful likes of Johnson, Taylor-Young and Facinelli hold their own.
The mood is still there but it's impact is lost when seeing in WS.
but still manages to convey the film's two main selling points--sex and violence, dished out in fairly equal measure.
For the ladies in the audience, the picture features Nino Castelnuovo, so fondly remembered from 1964's "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg," still looking hunky here and sporting a perfectly round butt; and for the men, another exquisite appearance from the Queen of Giallo, Edwige Fenech, short-haired here but still quite dee-lish.
), but still nothing compared to what filmmakers get away with today.
The folks at Blue Underground should be thanked for a fine-looking DVD of a true Italian rarity; still, I'd be thanking them more had they supplied some subtitles rather than the lousy dubbing.
If you still want to see it, go into it thinking of it as a comedy.
Yet she still has to match the results with the packaging before she reacts.
Fenech has had her hair cut down for her role here, but she's still the sexy little minx that Giallo fans love her for being, and seeing her strip nude is always a treat!
All right: I still own it, and I even pre ordered this, since I'm a giant fan.
PS--I still have no idea what a cat-woman is.
After their rocket lands on the dark side of the moon the astronauts find a deep cavern where air still exists and where these suits can be dispensed with.
But, I still watch it!!!
He's still cool though.
In Buffy, his English accent was convincing, although it veered between Olivier's Henry V and Eastender's Peggy Mitchell at times, it was still very good, in this film he paradoxically sounds like an Englishman doing an incredibly bad US accent.
Although she was past being a teenager when the original silent version of "The Road to Ruin" (1928) was made, beautiful Helen Foster (as Ann Dixon) is still an innocent young thing.
Hollywood although as multicultural as ever still would seem to orientate towards white audiences and also of course towards men, hence there are few interesting roles written for men of non-Caucasian heritage and also women, but importantly the figures are better.
Still, however the films of Spike Lee and co although important are still essentially cult movies.
The various camera experiments didn't really pay off, it's still got that kind of daytime drama feel to it, (great for daytime dramas, not so good for films) and the less said about the painful slow motion scene the better.
Ditto at the start of the film when she's still a girl - she's more demure and softspoken, but the high pitch of her voice mostly succeeds in conveying YOUTH, moreso than GENDER.
While it is still watchable, this isn't exactly a glowing endorsement.
Ms. Hepburn was a good actress, but better parts were still a few years ahead.
What can one say about a movie like this?I feel like I've been in a pillowfight,where all of the pillows were soaked in Ether.I can't believe anyone thought that this would be a good idea.Apparently some of those guys in Hollywood,drank too much wood alcohol during prohibition.I still can't believe I saw this.OK,imagine this,if you will:A Roy Roger's style western,complete with its stupid translucent plot line,extremely lame acting,pathetic special effects(assuming there are any),lousy stunts,silly slapstick comic relief,and horrific,lunatic singing.Now,shrink all of the characters down to 1/3 their normal size.And,Viola' you have,the Terror of Tinytown.Sort of a Roy Rogers on acid,if you will(or if you won't).Although, in all honesty, when I first saw the "cowboys" riding around on shetland ponies,I nearly busted a gut laughing so hard.But, other than that,its pretty much a waste of time.
Well, despite being a very bad and offensive film, in a way it was still oddly fun when it wasn't being creepy.
No, it's still deserving only of 1 star and perhaps, if you are a bad film fan, it's worth a look.
Although built smaller scale to make average western stars look bigger, the town is still way too big for little people.
I still enjoy following the French soundtrack and evaluating the quality of the English translation.
The thing that I REALLY like about it is the fact that the production team found a way to put sci-fi elements into the story while still making it believable.
I would definitely recommend this film to anyone old enough to understand it; although it's gotten mixed reviews, I still think it's a gem among other more shallow, lackluster films.
A man in his seventies makes a short film (under fifteen hours) in the French language, a man who was the vrais thing in France and a totem among cinephiles...so we went, as we are Francophiles (and have seen hundreds of French films here and abroad in the last decade) and are ever hopeful (despite towers tumbling, poison powder letters, and Jacques Chirac still in power)that the human imagination and a film budget will lift us.
When it is presented originally Va Savoir looks tantalizingly delicious, but after ten minutes of eating you realize that you finished and still hungry.
It was as if he never really wanted us to fully understand them, but still accept them.
The connections made at the end tied the film up nicely, but still left too many questions unanswered.
The first two hours of the film are a great displeasure to sit through, being dialogue-heavy with characters that are still "normal" in their actions and dialogue.
Even if you read into it and say that it was about a war between Nixon and Lennon, I still say that's a flimsy reason.
I walked away really wishing that John were still around to state his case for himself retrospectively.
You'd at least think that the utterly infuriating little toad Watney would have been killed by the Queen, but no...the last scene is of this total moron walking down a road in 'America'(for America, read Italy), still wearing the lame ass costume he got in Gor.
Then someone noticed that they still had three days left on their equipment rentals, so they decided to film a second movie.
If you read this and still want to see this "film," I encourage you to go on youtube and watch just 5 minutes of the thing, you'll see what I mean.
After reading about this notorious film i finally managed to get my hands on it.In some ways it lived up to my expectations but in several ways it did not.The female acting was good, male acting was bad, the sound was bad but the music was superb and spooky.Although still quite disturbing and gripping the violence displayed was quite poor and very overrated, and without giving anything away the supposed real footage at the end, wasn't worth waiting for (one reviewer even suggested that the footage was fake, surprise, surprise!!!
The concept and idea is decent but the film's overall plot is so absurd that by the end of the film, if you are still awake, you are squirming in your seat hoping none of your friends find out you watched it.
At least the movie didn't turn out to be a kill all teens slasher movie and they tried a different style in the storytelling to put away the worthless teenagers but it still doesn't really work as an interesting movie.
At least he's still working.
he was an "American" psycho...a fraud...a tacky, tacky fraud, as most people were in the 80's...as being the purpose of this book...to comment on the American condition during that time(and in my opinion it is still mostly apt) thus negating the premise of this entire movie...unless your an idiot and completely missed the point of either the book or the movie...then the movie will still suck!!!!!!!!!!!!
i still can't believe when business in America count on American stupidity...they win...because it's true...how could anybody misinterpret such a concise ending...how exactly do you feed a kitten to an atm anyway...arrrrgghhhh.
That would make it bad, still, but not necessarily awful.
But it is still very disappointing.
Films I like better: "American Psycho", which seems to have been developed by vastly superior beings, and is only related by marketing ploys, "Wild Things", which features more entertaining female psychotics and murders, "Bible Black: Lance of [...]"(its still in production, so I'm not sure of the title, but it is going to be good.
Rent this only if you're a vapid teenybopper who still thinks the "Scream" films are 'hip.'
If you saw the original you will hate this , if you haven't you will still hate this .
hell no...AND the Hummer will still be drivable afterward!!!
But, in 1926, movie-makers were still struggling to discover the basics, whereas in 1959 cinema was a relatively mature medium, and 1959 version could look back on two prior productions (not counting The Circular Staircase, 1915 and 1956).
If one disagrees with my assessment, then he or she will still be free to buy a higher quality copy for future viewing.
Still it did make me chuckle a couple of times, laugh once and cry lots when after ten minutes discovered it still wasn't over...
Terrance Howard still recovering from the diabolical August Rush puts up a decent fight as the sadistic doctor who seems hell bent on killing Christianson and after viewing his performance I would gladly assists.
Alba, still recovering after Fantastic Four Rise of the Silver surfer.
I just saw this movie last night and, being someone who had very low expectations to begin with, was still disappointed.
This falls in the so bad it's good area--but still it's just a 1 all the way.
I observed a BAD Humphrey Bogart recently that actually had a much higher percentage of scores of 10 than CASABLANCA--even though the overall score was still quite low.
If you have seen it as a child I can understand why you may still like it as an adult.
This remake was a lot better than the one made several years before, but it still is missing something.
On the bright side, effects were solid, Ivonova still rocks, and the audio commentary was fun to listen to even though not enlightening.
Independent or studio, it still has to be good, and this isn't.
Supposedly there is still one special effect left undone.
Or maybe Americans still think that Eastern Europe is some kind of wild land, the land of poverty, devastation and murder, and it's dangerous to be even near those places.
Perhaps there is an audience of Americans willing to exchange their ignorance of Europe for the misshapen image that risks becoming the pop culture residue of this movie: a Sybaris for bored backpackers, where women resemble lingerie models, preschoolers gang bang mercilessly, and where the occasional ex-Nazi still hobbles about his same unspeakable errands, more circumspect in his depravity than forty-odd years ago.
One of the characters is supposed to seem like a nice guy, but still never really develops enough for us to care.
But it still wants to base the horror in exactly the same sort of scenes as Serras short - and fails miserably!
And he's still glad he's human.
The industry at the time, which was even before 'The Birth of a Nation' (1915), was still struggling even to attract middle and upper class women to theatres.
The voices of reason, one might think, but she still tries and fails.
While Scott has toned down the ultra-kinetic cuts and filters for the main action, his style is still stamped on the graphics of their screen showing the past.
Yes, the most basic and essential elements of the story are still there, but only the bones.
Well, I suppose there wasn't much to do with the material at hand, but still.
Especially the ending where the victims are located in a place where there was no chance they could have had access to, but they are still spotted immediately by their rescuers.
Then when you get to the half, even if you were trying to still believe its contrivances, the storyline becomes so incredibly stupid and fragmented you start thinking you must have dozed off at some point and missed something.
Apparently, not but they were still hired to make the movie.
This is cemented when the campfire Jason story is interrupted thus a newcomer still wouldn't know anything about the origins of Jason.
Yet they were still hired to make this movie.
Yet, her very clean shirt is still nicely tucked in and her finger nails nicely manicured.
And we still don't know anything about Mr. Voorhees!
I still haven't figured out if they really intended on making a slasher or a porn - the sex and nudity far outweigh the gore.
Hollywood's remake machine still droning on, and eighties semi-classic Friday the 13th is the latest film to get the unwelcome treatment.
Luckily, it didn't cost me anything to see (but I still want my money back!)
So expecting nothing and knowing I had my old favorites still to watch I went to check it out.
And if Jason was playing possum the entire time, why didn't he just kill them when he still had access to a wood chipper and a barn full of tools?
Why was his body still intact after all those years in the lake?
Why are you still reading?
A still lovely Karin Dor wanders into the film from her retirement as a distant relative of one of the victims, and joins forces with the plucky detective to try and get to the bottom of the mystery.
So, even though I didn't like it much, I'm glad movies are still being made that a kid can watch and get lost in.
Definitely a "B" movie, with limited special effects and wooden acting, but still fun for kids.
I wish Joe Bob Briggs was still reviewing movies, because that's the most entertainment anyone could hope for from this film.
A viewer still gets that rich sense of chiaroscuro and guns flashing out of the dark still pack a punch.
Most blue collars workers in Singapore put in 50, 60 hours per week and still stay poor.
Neo's direction still looks like a newcomer film student who wants to play with the effects and have more the aspect of a TV film than a cinema feature.
This is another one of those rambling, pointless mid-1980's comedies that keep going on and on, without having anything to say, and without caring if the viewer is still amused or interested.
Beyond that, I still don't see what everyone loves about Neverwhere.
However, that's still half on their part that they suck at.
However, if you did get past all of the above problems and loved it still, I highly recommend running headlong from you television sets and diving in to American Gods, The Sandman, or any of the other fine written works of Neil Gaiman.
Not exactly action-packed but still silly enough to provide a few chuckles to bad movie aficionados--but probably of no interest to others.
Despite its near epic length, it still feels like at least a good 20 minutes of the running time were added simply to make the film longer.
As it is, watching it is more history than enjoyment, while the novel still holds up as well written detective fiction.
SPOILER ALERT: Worse still, the "killer" that is terrorizing the females (the detached penis of the protagonist), is never related psychologically to its owner, so that an opportunity for discussing male violence or a split between the civilized and savage parts of male desire, is missed.
While one must assume that this was intended to be that way, the movie still turned the corner towards "cheesy" way too hard.
He takes a generic, usually one note role; the haunted man, and imbues him with multiply layers of emotional depth (quakingly fearful yet strong, bravery in spite of moments of cowardice, morose but dryly humorous, fatalistic yet willing to act, haunted but yet still able to hope, etc) turning in a well rounded, excellent performance.
i really enjoyed the original Tremors.it worked on a lot of levels.unfortunately,this sequel doesn't.it seems to be mostly played for camp value,but i don't think it works very well.i found it very mostly very slow and boring.there were a few almost amusing moments,but overall,it was a disappointment.Kevin Bacon passed on this one,and it's easy to see why.he must have read the script.Fred Ward is back,but without Bacon,he his character just doesn't work as well.Michael Gross returns,and doesn't have much too do.also,i thought the dialogue was pretty cringe worthy at times.plus,the movie isn't really original.in fact it borrows heavily from another big movie that had come out a few years ago.i've seen worse movies,but this one still ranks as a major disappointment.for me,Tremors 2 is a 4/10.
S.S. Wilson handles the directing reins for this movie, and while he doesn't match the incredible job Ron Underwood did, he still does a solid job behind the camera.
I got to see this movie for free and I still feel as though I have been cheated.
It's been more than 48 hours since I watched this pitiful exercise in ego masturbation disguised as film, and I still can not erase that truly vile scene of the narrator receiving oral sex, out of my mind.
I was drawn to this in that manner - a wreck on the highway that apparently no one else but me sees ... why is it still there?
The result is still a second rate sequel with poor animation, and worse music.
As someone who lived through,and still remembers that decade vividly,if the actual '70s had been half this funny and (semi)normal,they would have been so much more enjoyable.Actual kids in that era did not act or behave anything close to as bright-eyed and normal as these kids did.The country's youth was still under the influence of the hippies and the drug culture all that '60s rebellion that it spawned,especially in the behavior department;the petulance,the smugness,the self-righteousness,the childishness,the unreasonableness of them - none of the characters exhibit any of that.
On risquÃ© Broadway the girls who are still virgins wear beanies; in the film they wear them to signify that they have never been kissed (it is amusing to watch these aging and jaded RKO starlets trying to pass for ultra-chaste teens).
This is a kind of "morality play," featuring a young albino man who has superhuman intellect and psychic powers ostensibly due to his mother having been killed by lightning while he was still in utero.
That being said, it's still terrible.
I thought I was going to puke during many scenes and lines that, however tamed down, were just quieter racial and sexual stereotyping, still echoing throughout America today, by either well meaning and mostly caucasian "moderate" liberals or conservatives.
Oh yeah, and I forgot about the redeeming message in this film --- I'm still trying to figure that out.
seriously if I were to recommend any of the Pink Panther series which I am still trying to put my finger on why the #### anyone calls the series COMEDY (don't worry I get that a lot like with movies like Charlies Angels 2, Pirate Movie, Muriels Wedding (I am still ashamed I even watched it) (don't watch Full Throttle even if somebody pays you $100) well this movie is horrible not for anyone with intelligence (maybe from Cluesau to Clueless)
En la Cama is an improvement in Chilean cinema, thanks to its technical details, but still it has a long way to go, it needs to figure out how to truly reach the audience.
I think this film is awful it was done when Peter Sellers already was dead.Maybe there are funny clips when Peter Sellers are in but I still donÂ´t think that this film are a little bit funny.
Having said all this, I still think it's possible for someone else to enjoy this movie.
There are many potential characters: Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom, twitching again), the head of the French Mafia (Robert Loggia) - still struggling from their defeat by Clousseau in 1978, and even Sir Charles and now Lady Lytton (David Niven and Capuchine, reunited for this second film).
I still can't figure out why they made a Pink Panther movie after Peter Sellers died.
For one, the film's audience must accept that adopting a child or inseminating a young wife are less harmonious actions to a newlywed's continued happy home life than the notion of pushing a husband (who truly does not desire to remarry) to marry an additional wife for breeding purposes with the resulting children being emotionally commandeered by the first wife while the biological mother (second wife) still lives on in the home with no deep attachment to either children or husband.
Some of the character tensions and a non-clichÃ© ending manage to make up for this rise above the crap pile, but it is still poor and given the premise and potential, very disappointing.
But that said THE UNTOLD is still a very poor film in just about every aspect , especially editing .
What they don't know is that she was killed by a sasquatch (Taras Kostyuk) and it's still out there... waiting for them.
Still you can still see that Cusack was destined for bigger stuff.
Not quite a "Limbo" or "Lone Star", but this is still entertaining and involving stuff.
And the werewolf is naturally still after her, while she continuously injects herself with monkshood to stave off her inevitable transformation.
While it may not be completely satisfactory for viewers craving a high body count, it still piles on a fair bit of gore for prime visceral impact.
I wanted to like it more, and I still do.
I've watched it three times now and I still fail to see how this is a horror movie.
Afterall the story of Annie Sullivan teaching Helen Keller communication is timeless and the 1979 version does prove that remakes can still work.
Hellseeker sees the return of Ashley Laurence to the series in the role of Kirsty, and the good news is that she still has the charming good looks that made her role in the first two films so good.
Concerning Pinhead, I really have no idea why Douglas Bradley still does this crap.
I always thought she was a talented and attractive actress, and I can see even 15 years later, she is still talented and beautiful.
$650 every TWO weeks is a more realistic going-rate for undocumented housekeepers in the wealthier enclaves of southern California, and THAT figure is probably still too high.
In the end, we are expected to believe that Flor is too virtuous to have any personal desires, though there is still something resolutely selfish about pulling her daughter out of the scholarship-funded private school.
Leoni does a good job with Deborah, but still, her character is so two-dimensional.
I attended one 30 years ago and my mother still teaches in the school system, which is now about 90% Hispanic and/or African American.
She changes law so that Sandler's character can marry her mother while still married to his own wife.
Dan's true love actually recovered from her coma and is still alive!
Moral Orel is still an interesting watch (as long as it comes between superior shows on Adult Swim) because it is a satire.
Following the first half hour, we still had no real clue what was going on, we thought maybe it would improve and that we had not lost the plot.
I was fortunate in that the DVD I have has been gut to 1:43mins, but still had to reach for the fast forward button after 1:30mins.
Moreover, Hooper's wise decision to keep the violence largely off-screen enhances rather than detracts from the film's alarming power to scare and disturb; this welcome and refreshing concession to the viewer's imagination ensures that the movie never deteriorates into a mindless and revolting bloodbath while still allowing the jolting outbursts of sudden brutal violence to retain their ability to startle the audience.
overall together with the first one my favorite part, i mean normally i'm not a fan of little girls in movies, and i hate it most if the director wants to force you into still liking her after she killed humanity or some sort of that, like the children in 28 Weeks later who have just wiped out our world and humanity, hated them right from the beginning, while i even liked Ghost after we learned about her, i mean it's quite a feat playing at the end a little murder girl and still appearing genuinely innocent, but i think it's the way her illness makes her into believing what she does.
From Hell is like Dead Presidents (which is better, though itÂ´s still pretty bad): graphic violence and thatÂ´s it.
One suspected his heart was not really in this hotly steaming turd and he just went through the paces playing the exact same role as he did in "Sleepy Hollow," which, though it also had a tired old plot, still turned into a great movie.
Even late into the movie, as all her friends lay horribly slain, she still stubbornly sticks her nose in the air with these ideas rather than just taking the money offered to her (and at this point it should be quite obvious that it's not someone trying to get in her pants) and getting the hell out of dodge.
Take The Evil Dead (1981) 10 film students, $375,000 and still a great film.
I still believe that it is the worst movie that I have seen (with an actual budget).
So, "Blade Runner" and "Minority Report" are still the gold standard.
(it didn't require much) 2)Do they still have a job?
Alright this was a total mess on every level - still, it was very, very funny and for that reason I think I could recommend it, caution: in the end you might feel a bit ashamed for laughing so hard at something that wasn't meant to be laughed at.
It's still probably 1 star more than it deserved, though.
A few beautifully natural breasts get bared, but I still cannot give this anything higher than 0.5 out of 4 stars.
Ha Ha - I would sooo love to see some Roman gangster - however darkly handsome and with an unlikely past - fall head over heel in love with Amelie Poulain ha ha ha - I'm still laughing.
ha ha ha ha - I'm still laughing.
Everyone to their own tastes, but I found nothing to get excited about ( and nothing entertaining) while I was watching KCET's "Saturday Night Movie", and Martin Sheen promised me I'd see a hilarious film - I'm still waiting to laugh.
I still am pleading STORY, STORY, STORY, please......
it still had the same impact as the remake even without the blood and gore.
Of all people, Brigitte and Ginger should still have a lot to say to each other.
The only high points to the film are the presence of Robert Forster, who is still good even in dreck like this and gets a few good lines and one scene later in the movie when the banker deals with his blackmailer.
All of the episodes were boring, and I think even if I appreciate The Ten Commandments, I'd still hate The Decalogue.
Now other countries are advancing faster than us because the cowboys are still riding the same dead horses.
For starters, the characters I once thought were "cool" are still cool, but nothing else beyond that.
The (very blatant) references to 'Mr Vampire' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' prove that, but it still felt like the movie was taking itself too seriously.
Even over thirty years after release, it is still terrifying, which can not be said of many well-remembered horror films.
So campy, I stopped the DVD many times, and until now, I still haven't finished watchin' it!!!
The original still has the ability to impress any public...and how !!!
If John Waters wants to still be subversive in 2007 why not make an ironic Gen X comedy film called 'A CLOCKWORK CHUCKY"... or FERRIS BUELLER'S UNEMPLOYED ......think about it.... hmmmmm?
To be honest, I've only seen the MST3K version, but it is still easy to deduce that this is a total clunker, with horrendous use of stock footage, dialouge that can induce a grand mal seizure, cheap, CHEAP cardboard back drops, and terrible acting all make this movie, one to avoid.
And at just an hour long it still had 15 minutes of padding.
I think the fact that I saw this movie when I was about fourteen, at the height of my FPJ crush and still didn't like it, really says something.
Hollywood makes these movies because they know that they're trash but the opening sales will cover the cost of the production and still make a small profit.
Sometimes you can watch a comedy with a predictable story but still enjoy it because its funny.
Even so they end up going to the same uni and that's where they become friends, but as Jennifer can pick any guy she still continues not to be satisfied and where Ryan was concerned he seemed like the perfect guy she could talk to since he wasn't interested in getting involved with anyone there were no problems between them.
I still say that the french translated version of the first is better then the original English version (both are good in their own ways)  Here tho we get a bad attempt from the dubbing company to recapture the magic of the original french translation but all we get is a badly translated movie.
It also shows that even though Disney is making shorts again, they're still sentimental fluff on topics the maker's don't really know that much about.
Therefore nobody invested in the renewal of machinery, in the 1980s they still produced the Ford Falcon model of the 1950s (maybe they still do?).
', but still give them relief: Death.
And granted, a bad Meyer film still has a lot going for it.
I'm saddened to see that a show that I watched from 1965-1992 and then started watching again when Steve and Matt and Mary Beth returned is still going to be so terrible.
This was a TV movie, a lesser episode of Degrassi Junior High (sorry Degrassi for making this comparison, I still love you), an After School Special.
Daniel MacIvor, you did your best and played your role with heart, for this I thank you...but then again you also wrote it, so I'm still upset.
If you like mindless fluff, then there are still a hundred other pieces of mindless fluff you'd be better off watching than this rubbish.
Finding the couple's blanket outside the neighboring house, he investigates and finds Pam still alive inside a freezer.
Loving "Ginger Snaps", a film which if you're like me felt left too many unanswered questions, coming into "Ginger Snaps 2" I was eager to see not only how they answered the unanswered questions, but seeing if they could keep the name Ginger Snaps still alive.
Besides even still as a sequel there are still too many unanswered questions, and don't even get me started on that ending.
Toni Collette's face is still in my memory - her terrified-to-do-or-say-the-wrong-thing rabbit eyes, her rapture at feeling connected to her 3 fellow temp workers (and specifically, seeing her nose crinkle the way it does when she smiles), the desolation of seeing their bond destroyed by wretched but inevitable bone-chilling office politics and fear.
is a sham, the "Commies" are treated as the usual moron's we were taught to believe them to be in every other propaganda flic, but it still serves to remind us of a time when even seduction was innocently provocative.
Although intended to showcase American airpower in the 50's, it could be redone as cold war retro flick because the footage is still cool and beautiful.
I think what is still with me after this is the sense of fear and utter WEIRDNESS that emanates from the movie...  And it all seemed so realistic...no hokey fountains of blood, no running into the shower, or overused cliches, just a bunch of kids that need to get some gas, meet some very odd characters (The Hitchhiker is superb) and then fall into the wrong place at the wrong time...
Why John Landis is still thought of as a great director is beyond me.
Instead of showing the film world she was still a player (post Beatty), she drops out and bombs doing it.
These women have not changed since high school and still have low self esteem and I can't believe he supports them and then tells these other women on other shows that acting like that is wrong.
It doesn't matter how much you are paid, it still hurts.
It seemed like a sad show for sad people (and it's certainly still that) but I admitted certain things about it, like finding out whether guys had cheated or were the fathers of children or not, could be quite suspenseful.
Amazingly, it's six years later and this nearly 70 year old man is still presenting a show that has obviously remained popular enough for the networks to keep broadcasting it.
This has gone from being a 'sad' show to a truly pathetic show and it says a lot about society that six years after my first review it's still going on and it will nearly have been on air for twenty years!
like, "why am i still watching this crap?"
Besides, how do Kuntz and McGuire still have a job in America after writing this blatantly hatred-based "comedy"?
Oh, I forget, America is still a breeding ground of racist folks.
As Fred Allen once observed, "You could take all the sincerity in Hollywood, drop it into a flea's navel and still have room for an agent's heart."
The eyeball effects are good, adding color change to the original glow (which effect, by the way, still stands up in the B/W version).
I didn't expect a masterpiece in "Dracula's Widow" of 1989, but I was still somehow disappointed.
This is still pretty appalling.
Jumpin' Jack Flash is still the best of her early big screen comedies.
Ta-taaaaa...the police arrive to tell the still non-sleeping members of the audience that they knew what was going on all the time.
What makes the film more interesting is that the Korea War had only been over for six years and Peck's character was still alive.
But still, I could not look away.
"Frankenfish" is still the best Sci-Fi movie yet, IMHO.
It took me almost a year to get this film back, and the person who borrowed it still had not watched it (though we ended up seeing it together).
But still with a little help from my buddies I could have made the films digital effects three times better!
other then that the film was still one of the worst films I ever saw Sci-Fi channel produce, (and they have made some bad ones).
Afterwards, the terrorists flee to some island, still with their prisoner, and the SEALS pursue.
Though there are still some scary parts, and a few jolts here and there.
The bad news is that the film is still covered in the muck and mire.
I still don't know.
I'd sat and watched the DVD of 28 Days Later the previous night: now that's a film not afraid to be British that still went down a storm in the States.
I am a HUGE fan of the books - but even with my many readings and understanding of the plot - it was still at least 45 minutes in before I figured out who Merriman was :( Some good actors in there - I often wondered how they must feel, locked into a contract and just KNOWING that they are involved in something truly awful.
Take the time to find a place that is still showing Stardust, if it is 2 counties away, still worth more than subjecting your self to this terrible "coming of age" fiasco.
Gregory Peck is the commander of a company of 135 men who knowing that peace talks are being held and the fighting will soon be halted must still take charge of his command and follow his orders to take Pork Chop Hill.
If you did not read the book, still skip the movie.
They even still have time to celebrate Christmas, even the ones who know the world could end in five days.
It's fiction but it's still more factual than this waste of film.
but if you ignore the flawed story, "takedown" is still mediocre.
This powerful and well-made Korean War drama is not quite in the same league as Milestone's earlier classic, but it still paints a vivid picture of the harsh realities of combat, and conveys a palpable sense of the pointlessness of war.
It was pretty decent with the gore, but it was still kinda disappointing to me.
this was the worst movie ever....i can't believe i paid to see it... this movie tricked you into see it by claiming "based on a true story of a serial killer still at large" please...very very mad...i really would like to beg people to not see that movie...they'll thank me when they see it on tbs in a couple of years or something...and one more thing why did the black guy die???
But yet I'll walk out my front door and everyone will still be applauding this satirical trash.
And Debbie Reynolds, who tries her best in a horribly written and conceived role, is still a delight in the similar 1954 comedy "Susan Slept Here," which was far from a hit in its day but now looks better than ever--especially compared to this mind-numbing disaster!
On a scale of 1 to 1,000, I'd still give it a 1...  Perhaps I should point out that all the others I saw this with also said it was the worst movie they'd ever seen, and one of them was nearly 50, so I'm not alone.
Who cares if little miss moneybags doesn't get her boy, she still has her thousands of pounds, her family and friends and her otherwise amazing life (the boy who, by the way, is referred to as a 'sex-god', and is also 16 years old, two years older than her.)
She then goes running through the streets, still dressed as a stuffed olive.
Imagine a Hammer Horror edition of Crossroads directed by Michael Winner and you still can't begin to come close to the unmitigated crappery of this ferrago.
Like Faces of Death there are many "disturbing" scenes and recordings.Animal slaughter,murders,suicides,autopsies.There is just about the same amount of gore and violence as FOd,but this seems to have more of an edge.Faces of Death was a bit too dull.I'm still watching the movie,so something might change.But so far,this movie is very good with keeping me watching,except I'm not at the point of throwing up.But,the only thing that almost got me there was the autopsies.Pretty disturbing and graphic.I think these series would have been a lot better off without the animal slaughters.
The great majority of the movie is still photographs of murders, suicides, electrocutions, car crashes, blah blah blah blah blah ... and it's mostly SILENT FOOTAGE, so they've added in some canned background music and an idiotic narration to fill that particular void.
Just one still photograph after another, another silent video after that, all edited together randomly, with that annoying hack hairball "Damon Fox" providing an obnoxious and grating narrative.
The original Ginger Snaps was a refreshing take on the werewolf story - the way that it blended the similarities in the story with the puberty of teenage girls was both amusing and original and it proved that there was still some originality left in the genre.
This first sequel isn't quite as good as the original, but there's still much to like about it.
I could still notice the sadness and the general rubbish of the movie.
I still laugh seeing James Earl Jones shooting a shotgun and delivering fine lines like, "Damn boy.
OK... i'm now a little more than half way through and i'm still clueless as to what it's all about...
I started watching this after seeing footage of devastation in the film's first 25 minutes thinking there's going to more, even it if was CGI or old archive stuff there would be more chaos--BUT I got instead was boring by the numbers human dramaÂHey this is not the Hallmark Channel; I was baited and then the emphasis of the movie switched--and I am still livid over it!
If you loved Plan Nine From Outer Space you will be happy to know that the genre still lives on, albeit only on late night HBO.
This is a largely unknown cast, less John Rhys-Davies, Rutger Hauer, and the actor who played "Zale" on TV's M*A*S*H.   The story is stale, but still this is not an awful film; the actors turn in, in my opinion, as good a performance as could be derived from the material.
A poorly developed script full of diabolical dialogue and precious little action doesn't help matters, of course, and with Findlay's visuals having that distinct porno quality (an effect helped no end by regular nudity from some suspiciously low-rent bimbos), the result is a nasty looking and amateurish yawn-fest that, although not quite as terrible as Blood Sisters, is still a chore to sit through.
But the next winter sacrifice is coming up and one of the cult members suggests using his granddaughter because she's still a virgin.
Even with the finale slamming the door on you; this mild horror movie is still fun to watch.
The puppet special effects are the worst of the series so far too, there's a few seconds of stop-motion by the vast majority of the effects work is simple poorly operated rod puppets which look still & have very limited movement.
Okay, it is realistic material that is filmed, but still... First of all the introduction of the main character takes very long - and it's not worth it!
Brazilian movie industry still needs a lot of improvement concerning casting !!!
She was, however, cast in a mediocre film but was still entertaining.
The movie should be viewed by students of film, sociology and American history so they might have a better understanding of the negative, demeaning attitudes toward Blacks so prevalent in the U.S. until relatively recently, traces of which still exist.
It's sorta nice to see that movies can still inspire sheer, honest dislike even after being taught to be accommodating about art.
This was during his later years when he was getting a bit long in the tooth to believably play those nasty, tough guy parts... but he is still the most interesting thing in this movie.
During the 80's and 90's,director Abel Ferrara was one of the leaders of the independent cinema making amazing films which challenged the spectator.But,his recent works are far away from his previous works.New Rose Hotel and R Xmas were a little bit disappointing but they were interesting experiments.But,I do not know what was Ferrara thinking when he was making Mary,a tedious and boring movie and,by my point of view,a huge let down in his career.During 83 minutes,the movie shows us three stories which are totally boring and uninteresting.I think Ferrara wanted to make an analysis about the religion but,still with that,I think he had to do a better work to make a coherent connection between the stories.For me,it is very disappointing that Ferrara,who made excellent films with very little resources(like,for example,Bad Lieutenant,The Addiction,Ms.45 and The Body Snatchers),was behind this crap.I hope Mary is only an unexplainable false move in Ferrara's career and that,he will get redeemed soon.But I cannot recommend Mary,which is a tedious film.
On the other side we have two stories about New Yorkers having spiritual identity crises, and an actress still neurotically lost in her role wandering through the streets of Jerusalem looking for something to eat, or something.
I bet that today most Americans still don't know about the revolt in Syria.
It was and still easier to concentrate on doing war movies against the Japan and Germany since we won those wars.
Some great stuff in here that still leaves me in shock of how it was pulled off, especially the mutant that helps the good guy; some great scenes with him.
Far from great, it still kept my interest and I made it to the end.
I'm still unsure as to what the filmmakers were trying to achieve seeing as it felt like they gave up hope early on in the story.
If so, that would be very clever of him, but the movie would still be a waste of time.
Hated it when it came out, still feel the same.
(Unless she just changed her name to prevent Honus from finding her, still in Pittsburgh.
Joe could have kicked the fire out and saved the cards, enabling him to go back to 1985 and give back the one card to her, while still have plenty for himself.
I thought I performed well, and am still waiting for my credit!
I'm still laughing- Not!
I'm still asking my myself what the point was.
This is a pretty awful movie that allows one to wander the house, do laundry, read a book (even the book upon which the movie is based) and still be bored with it (the movie that is).
She then marries again, while still married to her first husband, to the grounds keeper, Clancy Brown.
Then after a mail incident, her first husband finds her and comes looking for his wife, which of course he is still in love with.
I m still confused why this movie received such a high rating on IMDb.
It's still fun to pass the time with though.
THEN (it's still not over) Our Hero jogs up to pool side to shake Brett's hand for his fancy dive (and apparently raising enough money in doing so to end world hunger).
Los Angeles detective Nick Ferguson (Rhett Giles) is on the case & catches up with the killer but loses him after being stabbed in the heart, waking up in hospital Ferguson realises that he had heart surgery & that the killer is still at large, Ferguson's captain (Steven Williams) is on his case to get results & the pressure is also on from a sensationalistic media & a worried public.
Filmed in real locations the film has a very made-for-telly cheap bland look about it, it's competent but forgettable & I still don't get the red sky at the start.
It looked more realistic than chimps looked in films in 1940, but still looked bizarre and a bit scary!
It's now nearly 20 years since it was made, but my two daughters can still recite the entire dialog, and we still "crack-up" when we think about it!!!
I still don't understand what the f'n thing was about.
But part 1 is still o.k., and it's much shorter than part 2.
The triumph of the movie is that even with flourishes like psychic powers, a serial killer and an evil lunatic capable of blowing up the world, it's still the story of two star-crossed lovers, still the story of an ordinary man caught up in extraordinary events.
It's still human and down-to-earth.
This film was so bad that the memory of it still pollutes my brain some 25+ years later.
Two hours in, you'll be pining for the original film, with the "epic" karate fight in the lawn, Howard Hesseman's rambling improv comedy, and, yes, Coven's camp classic "One Tin Soldier" - and you'll realize that there's still an hour to go!
I watched it, and although the animation is not on par with anything that is out today, it is still probably one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life.
Not as bad as LAPD with Dennis Hopper but I still gave it a 1.
For better or worse, Walken's cool charisma and Argento's numerous nude scenes may still keep you awake through the whole thing.
Spending last night drafting my review of "Lord Of War" (only watched it the night before) and not really getting anywhere, I was distracted by the BBC who occasionally broadcast films that I have never heard of but still persuade me to watch.
Sienna Guillory plays Julie, a young au pair working in Italy and still traumatised by the death of her mother in a fire when she was 15.
A better film than "Zombiez" and "Dead Heist," "Gangs of the Dead" is still a rather pedestrian urban horror flick that thinks racial stereotypes and bad dialog are better than actually giving the viewer anything good as far as horror is concerned.
Thailand is shown to be a technologically advanced while India is still so backward.
But what impressed me about this movie was that it still managed to be scary.
I didn't think the 1931 Frankenstein was a great film, but it was still twice the entertainment that Branagh's is.
It's a well-acted, good-looking movie that I was still thoroughly bored with and unfortunately cannot suspend my disbelief and negative attitude toward the film to give it any recommendation except to those who want to see a faithful movie based on Mary Shelley's Gothic classic.
There are many great actors in the film such as the multi-talented Kenneth Branagh who both directs and stars in the film, Robert De-Niro who plays the distraught creature, Tom Hulce who plays Henry Clerval (Frankenstein's closest friend) and Helena Bonham Carter who plays Elizabeth, but this still doesn't bring the film to life.
With these cavils, I will still say that SPOORLOOS is at once terrifying, gripping,...and, well, amazing.
I still have no interest in really reviewing this film, but let me clear up a few erroneous statements from previous reviews:   1) Please don't trash James Whale's 1931 film unless you've actually SEEN it Â all of it, because it's a far superior film to this, bolts and all.
This film obviously has no understanding of the original plot (which is still current and worthy of discussion today), but the person(s) responsible did see "Bride of Frankenstein" and managed to screw up that plot as well when they tried to incorporate it into this film.
The cast is fantastic, stellar; but they are made to spew such insipid, laughable lines that I would not be surprised if not a single one of them doesn't regret being in it - excepting Kenneth Branagh, who is probably still in denial about blotting his brilliant career with this utter tripe.
Always the same old "stars" play in the "blockbusters" telling really bad jokes, but still, have really high reputation here.
They threw in some native characters to remind you that this is still a Batman story Â just on the off chance you may have seen Blade 1 and 3 and thought Â "Hmm, this sounds familiar!"
I still try not to think about that, because normally I really admire his work.
This just didn't seem very funny at all and even though it's been a number of years since I've seen it, it still reminds the standard against which I measure how bad a movie is.
And even if I hadn't seen this lame-assed movie with the knowledge of its origin, I would've still given it a failing grade.
Even for a movie made by college kids, with limited time, budget, equipment and resources, this is still an absolutely horrible film.
I still don't get the prudence of a gun battle on a submerged submarine.
Robert Englund is still a good actor, but this movie has not been watching, if you're the fan of Roberts character Freddy Kruger.
I am still trying to think of at least one good thing about this movie...well I am done thinking...Nothing Good !
The movie is not that bad, but it's still a waste of time.
Still, it's so apparent she's trying so hard that, throughout, you can't help but feel for her, a feat helped by the fact that she is obviously the only cast member who tries to create a character, though as written it's still the "hooker with a heart of gold" type, which is NOT the case with the 1980 film.
The use of the bookends felt like it gave the film a more authentic feel at first, but when they were revisited at the end, I felt slightly cheated and still confused.
Panic sets in; you check everywhere, question everyone, go over every detail until your head hurts and still nothing makes sense.
Three years pass and Rex is still searching.
For example, after sitting in a warehouse for 1000 years, Harriers will still fly.
And 1000 year old fuel will still be good.
1000 years and they still haven't finished mining the planet!
man animals as they call us) is weak and stupid and can't mine or do anything constructive, yet there is still the evidence of everything man built after the invasion.
Military bases still having power, surely the Psychlos would have destroyed any and all bases to ensure of no uprising?
I still can't decide if I think the Psychlos look is daft or inspired, but definitely not one of Patrick Tatopolous' finest hours (Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla etc).
And even under thousand of layers of bad make up you can still notice Travolta hysterical overacting (who takes his character waaaay too seriously, channeling Vincent Vega by the way of Danny Suko with a little bit of Tony Manero on crack) and Forest Whitaker face of complete embarrassment.
We are asked to believe that Earth has been strip mined by the vicious Psychlos for 1000 years, yet can still produce useful quantities of valuable minerals.
The next question I found myself asking is this, "How long would certain things (books, computer-dependent machinery, combustion engines) last and still be of any use to anyone?"
I don't particularly want to because I can still remember it vividly 16 years later.
Though that still doesn't begin to explain the end result.
There is a ghost-story twist to the whole thing, explained in about as heavy-handed a way as the filmmakers can muster (but still manages to make little sense).
anywho, Ingrid doesn't believe its over because she thinks Frankie is still on the loose.
To be precise, he is killed with the pick side of a two-headed ice axe, but even then, that's still not an ice pick, which is something entirely different.
Three years later, Saskia is still missing, and the abductor, Raymond Lemorne (Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu), a cool-facaded college professor, begins contacting Rex, promising to tell him the truth of what he did to Saskia... but Rex, desperate for answers, finds himself in a situation more horrifying than he could have ever imagined.
It, as well as the rest of the film, is depressing, dark, and somber, and while I wouldn't call it a "twist" (because it really isn't), it's still extremely effective.
Even if you view the movie as a drama instead of a potential romantic comedy, it still lacks depth and doesn't tie you to any of the characters.
While some of the acting is decent, the accent of the local Caymenees is hard to understand some of the time, and harder still to believe it comes off real.
Altogether, if the series was released in around 1991-92 with the books most promoted then it would have been more understandable and rightly timed but still probably would have sucked the same.
For a low budget the directing is tolerable, the screenplay still a disaster, and the characters are terrible.
45 minutes in and still nothing, just pointless conversation that Im guessing was supposed to be the character development?
After i couldn't get a ticket for Clerks2 or Silent hill because of the age problem( i am still not 15, not long to go though) so instead i bought a ticket for this film since all the other movies looked quite stupid.
Several years later, Rex is still obsessed with Saskia's disappearance.
Rebecca Romijn still looks good for her age but still has little screen presence.
Hollywood still loves a good fairytale.
Fifteen years later, it still makes me shudder sometimes.
Overall, there isn't really anything good about the film, though the production values are a lot better than Larry Buchanan's other films--which still isn't saying very much!
We still laugh about it, 30 years later, but it's definitely the top of the list as far as bad movies go!
Too many tequila sunrises were adding up for this director, and though he still had bullets in his gun, he wasn't placing them as well as before.
Frankly, I'm a fan of both sub-genres and still hated this, because it's still a ripoff, and as such, rates a 4.4/10 from...  the Fiend :.
Cut ahead three years and you still have him searching for her.
Meanwhile, you'll be wondering if the monster is still lurking about, or just fell asleep waiting for victims to get out of that bar that's featured quite prominently.
Even when The Asylum isn't ripping off another movie, they still suck.
After watching it I still couldn't convince my teenage kids to take a midnight drive with me down Bray road on Halloween 2005.
In classic fashion, if you can still find Graham Masterton's novel (which made the best-seller lists back then), when you read it you'll discover that what was great in print didn't necessarily come across that way on the big screen.
Yeah, I still have a soft spot in my heart for flicks like this, because without them, I wouldn't be the salivating, drooling horror/sci-fi/fantasy geek I am today.
Unfortunately for everyone, she's had so many X-rays to find out what's wrong that when he comes out, he's dwarfed and deformed, though still quite powerful (as demonstrated by his stripping the skin off a live human male and freezing the entire floor of a hospital, one hapless nurse right along with it!)
I saw this movie with a friend of mine about 20 years ago and we still laugh about it.
shes completely changed except for the fact shes still a werewolf, and is now an independent woman with some "problems" but soon after passing out in a snowbank from an overdose of monkshood is taken into a drug clinic and the story begins there.
Wow!I am quite disappointed that this could not compete with his recent sh*t called 'Kaalai'(The Bull-It was even more pathetic) Vallavan-has no story,screenplay and direction.It only has a good original score by Yuvan Shankar Raja.If he hadn't been there,the movie would have fallen flat.Even when he is there the movie still falls flat.
I think even SUPER STAR RAJINI did not had such "Build Up"s than Simbhu in his films...  Simbhu still have a long way to go and as a result he should TALK LESS.
i thought this show was awful cause new york didn't win and she was the one who went back for flavor the second time when she could of had someone else her mom was right she was the only one who really loved flavor not that dumb face ugly girl he chose gross what a fat hag gross new york is way hotter and sexier she is way more than the other girl flavor you made a bad choice you just better hope new yorks mom don't come after you but i hope she does just playing but why didn't you pick new york she is all you need telling you the truth she really loved you and you made her go home again after again sad but i guess thats you and whats up with the grills at the end i think its cute but i still think new york should of been wearing them
Mission accomplished and ... oh great, you're still in bed.
Instead they stand still (facing each other), wave a hand or two, and shoot little balls of light that knock their opponents out.
Nevertheless, the effects are still worth waiting for, just too short.
Or more importantly, was still a 14-year-old boy who could delight in laughing through a cupped hand at the hardcore sexual references.
Gwyneth does not have acting skills - I still wonder how she got that Oscar!
In the beginning he still seems like a cool guy but later on he suddenly for some reason turns into a complete- and boring dorky sort of person.
For too long the movie basically lies still when it isn't heading toward one clear direction and the characters and situations aren't interesting and strong enough to keep your interest.
Myers raises a few smiles as a lazy-eyed air crew trainer,but it is still baffling how this eclectic cast felt there was any mileage from a minor potboiler such as this,especially Oscar winner Paltrow (who has since described the film as 'terrible' in a subsequent UK newspaper interview).Gwynnie is a fine actress,and has ability in light comedy (as proved by her AA triumph in 'Shakespeare IN LOVE'),but she can do little with the feeble,uninspiring part she has taken on here (though she does look lovely in the numerous,if rather tacky outfits she wears),as is the case with other cast members such as Ruffalo and Applegate.There are also some rather pointless cameos from Rob Lowe and George Kennedy (recalling his Joe Patrone character from the AIRPORT series,which are actually rather funnier than this film),and the short running time (around 80 minutes) also indicates that much re-cutting and deletion took place beforehand (it sadly didn't improve the quality).
The first UL killer is still alive and has just gotten with the UL2 killer.
Despite constant reminders that the ghoulish Mary might be lurking about, most of the deaths still seemed like they really were just freak accidents.
Even "Final Cut", which had a new story and a new set of characters was still somehow connected to the original "Urban Legend".
Her reluctance to kill Angel in season one leads to Jenny's death among others but later on Giles still trusts her judgment.
She should be thankful she is still alive and wait for info from Spike and Andrew, not taunt the guy who gave them a thrashing on just a day ago.
Although occasionally diverting and sometimes innovative, it is still a small-time-crooks-run-rings-around-their-problems.
Almost laughable production, but still basically just plain bad.
Movies made in the late 80s/early 90s generally do, but they still remain some charm.
The only real instance we are 'some-what' presented with a feel is when a still shot of the school/warehouse/prison/business building is darkened using Photoshop for night and re-lit for day)a virus has changed FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE!!
Actually, I'm still not sure if this was supposed to be a comedy or not.
I mean the Freddy films became a bit silly, humorous, comic book and people still enjoyed them (I know I'm one of them) But the fact of the matter is, if your looking for a serious, creepy, dark horror film then your best bet is to stay away from this horrid sequel.
This is the case here too, but still I couldn't enjoy the movie.
I've seen this film about 20 times since I was a kid and it would play on cable and I still couldn't tell you what it's "about."
Which is not to say it isn't entertaining--it is, I still laugh at the commercial parodies and the ding-bat sexpot stenographer who has trouble spelling a certain very naughty word (by the way...DO you hyphenate it, I wonder?)
The outsider in every one of the movies is lame, nothing like the book (and I know, if they tried to make it like the book says they would have to spend a lot of money and it still wouldn't be up to par to Koontz's imagination) but at least make him like the 3rd movie, more reptilian looking with big claws (that don't dangle!).
If you're still curious to know why this movie is so incredibly bad.
The acting isn't particularly good and the dialog is a bit cheesy at times, but this is still a fun movie for those who like these low budget horrors.
They also fluff their lines on a number of occasions, and it's still included in the movie.
After nearly every shot the actors will be standing still and in the wrong positions from the last shot.
The seriousness could have been turned down and replaced with a lighter one, it could have warrant a passable rating (and perhaps, still keep its R rating).
I hated the 80's...still do and always will!!!!!
My brother already said it was bad, but I still wanted to see it for myself.
If you still want to see it, go into it thinking of it as a comedy.
Only thing I still don't get from this film: How the Hell does the hottest member of the team get placed as the mascot?
Yet she still has to match the results with the packaging before she reacts.
As you are still waiting for them to answer so many questions that have been brought up by the attempt at a plot.....the movie ends...we actually had to check the chapters left on the DVD to see if that was REALLY the end!!!
It's amazing that you can take a cast that includes the aforementioned Janssen (regardless of my rant, I still like him), Senta Berger, John Saxon, John Ireland, Elke Sommer, Ray Milland, and Anton Diffring and make something this bad.
The Free Will was not in itself awful, but there were so few points of interest that I found myself becoming restless within forty minutes, and when the credits rolled in what will doubtless be considered a brilliantly emotional finale, I still felt little attachment to the characters.
Therefore, in 2007, he would be seventy-nine year-old, still working and in an excellent shape.
The only reason that this show is still being aired is because half of Norways population is youngsters and oldies, who does not understand English or manage to read the subtitles fast enough, and there's no other shows to watch in Norwegian(Okey, you have the sucky sitcoms).
The only mildly redeeming area is friends turned and still pretending to be themselves, but even that wasn't done very well  Sorry, but I would only ever recommend this film to someone who has to treat insomnia, otherwise watch something else instead
And for the last, if you still want to watch this thing, watch it like something else, not the sequel to the Big Smash Hit.
Of course I was wondering myself why they still want robbing the bank after they become vampires (LUTHER and Jesus).
I found it a bit absurd, they still want the money; but that "explanation", even trying to be humorous, is really ridiculous and unnecessary!
I still give the show three stars, because of the soundtracks.
I was coming down from a hangover state when I saw this movie ... and it still couldn't satisfy me.
Who ever it was idea to put rock music on the movie you have to be out your mind I was high and thought to myself I must be out of it so I still continued to watch and sat through the whole movie.
I still can not believe this movie I was looking for a great World War 2 movie to watch and I get this.
I am still trying to recall if i have seen acting, direction and storyline all that bad in the same film.
Amazing that money is still being spent on making such rubbish.
The story of the various treasures stolen by the nazi's is still actual, and it should not be told by people who do not know how a real Dutch windmill looks.
It's sequel "Vampire Bats"(while still far from perfect), draws on this film's strengths and builds upon them.
In the case of the Matt Helm series it was obviously a still birth   THE AMBUSHERS is an awful movie not only because of its Bond wannabe format but because it`s woefully made .
007 is still going strong with many actors who now have done the role and it shows no signs of slowing down.
***SPOILER***  He goes back from the past to stop himself falling in love with a beautiful woman, who'll make him rich, but due to his own stupidity, tells himself she's bad and gets him burnt (and still gets the girl, the love and the money !!)
Even with the finale slamming the door on you; this mild horror movie is still fun to watch.
The puppet special effects are the worst of the series so far too, there's a few seconds of stop-motion by the vast majority of the effects work is simple poorly operated rod puppets which look still & have very limited movement.
However, my low expectations were still too high.
This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen (still not as bad as Glitter though).
It's been over 20 years, but the taste in my mouth is still bad.
This is a pretty good sequel for the most part that's quite entertaining with fantastic performances, however it comes nowhere near close to matching the original in my opinion, still I highly recommend it.
Tatiana Maslany is brilliant as Ghost, she played the creepy psycho very well yet she still managed to be quite likable, she was also energetic had some good lines, had a wicked character, and was totally unpredictable, I predict big things for this young actress!.
Eric Johnson is great as Tyler he was a bit of an ass and very cocky, but somehow yet still charming and quite likable I dug him for some reason, he did a good job.
Katharine Isabelle is still gorgeous as ever, but had only a few scenes was totally wasted!
Then, when we find out that these new insidious creations are flesh-and-blood, that still left me thinking, "How on earth would you create a human clone from thin air?"
That would still be a world that people would want to enjoy, and the tragedies at Delos weren't any worse at Westworld than they were at the other worlds (in the original film).
The director seems to think she is still on junior year abroad, her European, romantic literary tour.
However, there's still a problem: the plot is the most boring and poor script, this kind of movie could have!
The 'feminist' who produced and endorsed this give women and mothers a bad name, and I wonder if they still can look at themselves in the mirror.
And yet "Cabaret" is still standing as one of the most crucial films of the 70's, although it has to be said that the actual love story is secondary to the immortal songs and Â especially Â the portrayal of frustrated Germany during the years prior to WWII.
I applaud what Greg accomplished with the budget that he had, but sadly I still see this movie as a misfire.
Do they still buy this tripe on the Left Bank?
Though I have seen Tim Curry do some of the most startlingly different roles while still coming off as brilliant, this is not one of them.
When he's not on screen you can still hear him and when he's on screen but not staring he's always fidgeting.
Hollywood filmmakers LOVE tacking this moral onto their corny action epics, and apparently it doesn't bother them that if society never changed, we'd still be in caves right now eating raw deer carcasses.
I expected something like the "Shogun" with it holliwoodish but still interesting entertaining exploration of Japanese culture.
The worst part is the ending where Tom Cruise (an Amercian officer who came to teach Japanese the modern Western war technique and subsequently underwent a transformation embracing the "old ways" of noble fighting with the katana sword) together with his noble friends dash in their last suicidal charge with the naked swords right onto the machine guns of emperor's army and... what I see: all Japanese are dead and Tom Cruise is still hanging on, all wounded of course, but alive and with this tremendously heroic face he tries to stand up, alone among the corpses of all his friends.
The synopses you can read in other comments are accurate, but by the halfway point the story still hadn't picked up enough momentum to hint at an interesting outcome.
Unfortunately the spirit of Charles aka Chucky is still resident and he once again resumes his quest to regain a human body, which puts the now fostered Andy in trouble once again.
A little more humour is added to the mix but still the movie offers nothing of any real distinction to be a satisfactory sequel.
Chuck is back and still after Andy is now placed in a foster home after the tragic events of the first film since his mother was committed.
This film was made in the early 70s and I've probably viewed it almost ten times, but it still feels fresh and sharp in it's analysis of different people in a highly frustrated and controversial society.
We are in a sense encouraged to follow Chucky and still despise him at the same time.
Any joke involving Chucky isn't tongue in cheek, the viciousness is still there.
I tell you, she still is as adorable as when she played her role in American Werewolf in London...only older, of course.
After reading this review, ypou will probably still rent it, thinking it can't be that bad, but I thought the same thing!
Now it's true that many of these were for musical or set design awards, but still the film doesn't seem that exceptional.
It's still a rather good looking movie.
Now, that was really a pretty gutsy move on somebody's part since the war was still going on when the movie was released in 1952.
Originally, the location shots were probably interesting; I would still like to see the actual places.
While the business world finally realized that serving & pleasing the customer is the idea, the American media still obsesses with messaging us to death, reasoning, where else can we go for visual content?
I've seen it more than once, just to make sure I wasn't crazy, but I still don't get it.
I'm still not sure why they apparently have gotten rid of jet engines, but apparently they have, because there they are, flying across the Atlantic in a small turboprop.
If it were made in 1931, it would almost certainly be in Black & White, have primitive sound quality (sound pictures still being relatively new at that time), and maybe be a little less frank about its homosexual content (although being that 1931 was a year pre-code, who knows...).
If this had been the version that was originally released on the theatre's in 1991, then the series would still have been alive today.
The other world plot line is abandoned, thank God, but the main problem is still there.
having recently seen it again on cable it is still utterly woeful.
But still, destroying a concept so completely is almost enviable.
Well, even if we do overlook that major flaw this is still complete garbage.
MacLeod's still alive.
Movie-fans still discuss whether Liza was actually acting the role of Sally Bowles or just being herself (her Oscar-win still draws debates--Diana Ross in "Lady Sings The Blues" is oft-times described as 'robbed' for the Best Actress statue).
Wait for the DVD, and then you may still think about renting it.
First and foremost, I find it incredible that back in 1995 this film got an 18 cert in the U.K, and films like Straw Dogs or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre were still being refused.
"Tomorrow Belongs to Me" still gives me goosebumps every time I watch the film.
The actors are very good.I never cared much for Liza Minelli before but in this film she gives the perfect performance.Being very believable as Sally,who goes through so many things but still,in the end,decides to continue like before.
The old guy's nemesis finally shows up near the end, still after that skull.
If after all this you've red you still want to watch the movie better rent it from some tormented soul
Joel Grey's raunchy "Two Ladies" on the Kit Kat stage to the hysterical delight of the decadent crowd reminds us that all sexual propriety has broken down (including in the lives of the main characters, now involved in a threeway with one of the few Germans who still has some wealth intact).
To put it simply if it wasn't for being able to fast forward with subtitles still on I would have stopped this film within 30 minutes.
This movie was made for people who have read the book, and then they still need a little help.
Indeed, a very typical stereotype of the interwar period, think of Marlene Dietrich in "the Blue Angel"...Minelli's performance onstage with garter belts and a bowler hat still looks elegantly naughty today.
does a bad job, are they justified in telling you not to complain because they're still better than you?
Nearly 23 years later, my sister and I still have nightmares of this movie.
We were so afraid watching this slasher flick, that the very words in the title still bring chills to both of us.
Even after seeing all the Scream movies, I still haven't experienced that level of terror.
If MST3K were still on, they surely would have devoted an episode to this one.
The people who made it were very clever to capitalize on what are hot controversies in their part of the world, but it is still just fiction.
Even 19 years later it hasn't dated a bit and still sounds brilliant.
Not as bad as "Carnivore", this low budget film is still sh*t, but I have more respect for it then I have for "The Worst Movie Ever, Carnivore".
I fell asleep for the beginning of the third story and didn't even bother rewinding it, because by that time I'd learned that seeing the whole thing still wouldn't make it make any more sense.
They turn him into a violent version of Edward Rochester, with a still living wife hidden in the ancestral house, in squalor (similar to Bertha Mason Rochester in the attic in JANE EYRE).
Both also pace their story with still, calm images of scenery, Ruoholahti or Scotland.
By the end you still don't know if any of that was true and what were the people after her going to do with her once they caught her.
Direct discussion of the point of the whole story could hardly be a spoiler, since the final success or failure f this point is left for readers to discover, if they are still interested.
I'm still not quite sure what point the movie was trying to make.
Director Mathieu Kassovitz has been in the business for a while now and is a well complete actor as well and still something about this project went wrong.
New York City is jam-packed with neon advertisement, fold-out road maps are like Google Maps on paper and touch sensitive, and taxis have scrolling message boards on their sides, but Coke Zero is still around and advertising on passenger jets and the bad guys drive vintage, mint-condition 2008 Range Rovers.
is still a virgin and can't get any girls, so he obtains a plant which he keeps locked in his bedroom.
I still can't quite believe that a film like Please Don't Eat My Mother exists, who was the intended target audience?
The mincing machine is nothing more than a large box with a few dials & buttons on it and an opening for the body (still wearing underwear) to go into.
Even if you don't compare this series with the original, you still end up with a series for the masses, filled with oversimplified characters, jokes that aren't funny (the talking dog- OMFG), poor acting, and a way of telling the story that's insulting to the audience's intelligence.
There is obviously an audience out there for very dumbed-down versions of masterpieces but it still hurts.
While a few interesting individual episodes still managed to sneak in to Season 3, this season was a marked decline.
He's generous with his credits and he didn't mind if people laughed at the crummy effects when the picture was released and he still doesn't mind.
In the movie, though, he looks to be about 10 or 11, but seems to still act 6 or 7.
The director forces the actors to continue their rehearsal, and nobody apparently considers that, oh I don't know, someone was just pick-axed to death and the maniac who did it may possibly still be around.
The DVD is in B & W. Remastered but lacks any depth --- still looks old.
And it still stinks today!
I'd still like to see the film someday for its location cinematography and it's always fun to see the young Dean Stockwell.
Despite the still relatively low number of independent cult movies produced in Australia around that time, "Snapshot" is an adequate and professional accomplishment with proper production values, respectable performances and ambitious story contents.
But still, it could have been more interesting and dynamic.
Every 10 minutes or so there are these big emotional outbursts, and while you do eventually come to know why, there still is a serious separation.
Let us not forget Bill Macy from "Maude" and "The Jerk", still a cut up in his 80's, , and William H. Macy frequent David Manet collaborator.
His jovial, consoling advice to Ophelia to "get thee to a nunnery" is laughable, and while he hits the right note in the also well-conceived, but displaced finish to the scene, leaving the rest of the speech on her answering machine, we're still so busy laughing that the rage loses it's power.
I still wonder what Paulie was doing in that movie.
If you haven't seen Feds, do yourself a favour and rent it if you still own a VCR.
Little did I know that the film was, outside of the race footage, little more than exciting than the still.
1) The Jag is seen approaching the starting line with no race number, and in the next shot it is still approaching the start bearing the '55' that had been allocated.
Almost the entire movie takes place in the cockpit of a 1954 Jaguar XK120 roadster, a stunningly beautiful car in its day, and still highly admired by classic sports car enthusiasts, who will be the main audience for this movie.
Try the PBS documentary if you're looking for a less biased background of the conflict (though that still has some significant omissions).
The movie is something else, in quality it's not as good as for example the Beck-movies, but still an okay movie.
However, at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable.
No, Chaplin as the cute Little Tramp was still evolving.
However, as I have seen a major portion of the available output for Chaplin, I found myself still wanting to see all his films--even the bad ones!
However, it is still historical of course to see Chaplin in his first film, even though he is not honed.
Although I still don't know what's more painful.. watching this show or having the mob after you...
I am even sufficiently endowed with a huge circle of friends of many 'preferences in entertainment' to grant you that even minor criminals (still murderous but less stylish, say) can grab your attention for a few episodes.
As a half-Italian good old fashioned communist girl I took particular offense at the implied witless remarks suggesting Italy is still ruled by the Mafia.
ignoring the poor production value, The Other Side still totally blew.
It also seems odd with their appearance in the film that Sugar Ray didn't write an original song, instead recycling a song off of a 9 month old album (though the song was probably new when they began filming, but still...).
It combined comedy with intense straight up action and still works today despite having its conventions replicated in a thousand films since 1982.
Yeah, the nuns are still "good guys," but don't fool yourself: there's a lot of secular bias in this script.
I hate sequels, but I still watch them in hopes that there will be one that actually is as good or better than the original.
It was still a feel-good movie.
Regardless of whether crap was produced for only ten dollars or ten million dollars, it's still crap.
Supposedly the tongue grafts still work like tongues, as Torque says he can taste things through them.
I imagine that those still populating drive-ins as this flick came out(..I'm guessing, temporarily)probably cheered when Buzzi was on her way out of the picture.
Nothing was said about Canadians sending their slaves to what is now Michigan (then still held by Britain) to avoid emancipation.
His assertion in the film is that if the South would have won the War of Northern Aggression (AKA the American Civil War) that we (as a nation) would still be condoning slavery...not out of a need for inexpensive labor (which is a fallacy in its self), but out of a sentiment for the ways of the Old South.
(That those two would still be candidates after all these timeline changes or that there are elections at all in such a country is truly mind boggling).
The art direction is also good, and though the storyline is a bit muddled it's still not too difficult to follow.
I'll certainly still check out more films from Rollin based on the positives here even though I was less than enthusiastic about this effort.
I saw street fighter, Armageddon, Clockstoppers, the Core and the Day after Tomorrow in theaters and spoiler is still the only movie I've actually almost passed out from watching.
I don't like this film for it's really boring,story of a father who wants to satisfy her bride after the death of his son.like every Hindi movie the boy comes from big cities like New York or whatever & just after the entrance,he meets a typical Indian girl,they marry each other during one man still loves the girl & has dined his love to see her happy... You can watch this film which takes a lot of time of you & after it ends you are totally board.Amitabh Bachchan does the better job.as a satisfying father to do the right move whenever necessary.Salman Khan is a bit old to play a young man comes from abroad to fall in love in India.he doesn't play like he should.Rani Mukherjee is my sort of favorite actress in Bollywod,but i got to confess that she isn't prepared for such a role,Hema Malini is unused.she walks in the stage to prove she is there.
So, the movie should have been set where this is still an issue (like the movie WATER).
I'm still certain that somewhere, behind the propaganda, there's an interesting story - how did hatred of Catholocism spread so rapidly when only a handful of years previously, everyone in England was Catholic?
I'm with everyone here astonished that this film's still not available for personal acquisition.
I can still feel this film in my blood, though it must be 20 years since I last saw it.
Not dirty in your sexual or violent way but for the fact that a film could be this bad, and yet still make it on to TV screens.
Hitchcock has been one of the greatest film directors ever, and his movies are still evocative and compelling today.
I'm not sure if it killed people or not, because I was still laughing about the killer-cat, so I wasn't really paying attention to the third story at all.. One thing that I do remember is that the monster looked very strange and fake..
But this film still did not do perfect justice to the book which I still think was better.
Everyone else seems to be posing up a storm, like they cast a  bunch of models, led by Gorgeous George Clooney, still tilting his head  and smirking as though that made a character come to life.
A failure but a beautiful one, that still is not worth seeing.
I spent a good two or so days trying to forget this movie ever existed but it remains to this day... and I still want my 7.50 back
Apparently Tim Burton was set to direct this but decided to make Ed Wood (1994) instead, he might have actually injected some horror & mystery into the plot while still retaining the Gothic romance just like he did with his excellent Sleepy Hollow (1999).
I think my favorite at the moment is the scully dog (if he is still there).
- Exhausted by the effort of slapping man with a bottle, The Sandman stands bolt still for a good 5 seconds before diving on the floor while Burke waves his feet in his general direction.
And still strong though not as water-cooler talk as it used to be.
But still goes strong placing in the top ten of TV ratings about each and every year!
Worse still in a fit of angst and guilt it was this led to Dorian's grandfather killing himself and his daughter " Who'd have thought that the smallest thing in creation would kill the most number of people " Hmmmm well since the film ignores any sense of time and setting I think it's only fair neutrinos are smaller than atoms whilst firearms have killed far more people than atomic bombs .
(i.e Crumb) When Daniel Jackson instead went to deliver an idiotic moralistic speech following Vala's come-on I was overwhelmed with shock just how bad this bit was and that the production staff previewed this yet still allowed it to air.
The end is over pathetic and disgusting, the acting is bad, and worst, as it's still to play feminist no one will dare to say that girl, dÃ©sirÃ©e, is as bad, violent and stupid as everyone around her.
This last season (Fiji) was really boring, but I know the show can still stay fresh.
Seasons from best to worst (I haven't seen seasons 3-6)  Guatemala- It was really great after the merge, had great players, and Steph and Danni were the best Final 2 ever (I wish they still did the Final 2).
Pearl Islands- Unpredictables with a capital U. I hated Jonny Fairplay, and Rupert was a little irritating (he was better in All-Stars), but Sandra was great, and Jonny Fairplay still put a great spin on the game.
I think it only has 2 seasons left, but I still love the show, and enjoy it while it lasts.
There is a fairly high body count & a fair amount of blood too although it's not that graphic it is quite violent & whether Red Dawn would still get a PG-13 today is debatable.
The animals are still lovable and fun to watch, but the lack of adventurous moments makes it is pretty boring compared to the first one.
I also wonder why Chance still behaves like a terminally-naive puppy despite his last experiences in the wilderness which would surely have taught him a thing or two!
Not forgetting, in the first film, Chance explained that before he was adopted he was a stray dog, and was abandoned when still a puppy, so he'd know a little about living on the streets don't you think?
He's the embodiment of every guy in a midlife crisis who still wants to do "something really cool" with his life, to get away from it all, with a threesome in a Nicaraguan hotel thrown in for good measure.
The movie still succeeded in gaining a cult-status over the years.
What about all of the monsters still left in the sewers???
It still had some bite to it in the movie, but I just would have preferred they keep the focus on the monsters and not have the twist at the end they had.
Not sure how this one did, but you still get mentions of C.H.U.D.S in popular culture today as I remember a Simpsons that mentioned them.
I still laugh at the deep-burrowing craft developed for the mission itself....which is the mechanical equivalent of a Diamond/Carbide-toothed sea Lamprey(species of Leech).
I did try doing that and it still wasn't very enjoyable for me.
The plot is an absorbing one, which doesn't break a whole lot of new ground like the original, but still comes up with enough hunger to set it out from most other horror flicks of the last decade, but also adding another dimension to the tale.
The field may be weakened, but the atmosphere would still protect our little bridges from cosmic radiation.
Combine with some script holes, and you've got a mediocre movie, which is still much better than the Marlon Brando/Val Kilmer version.  
First, maybe I was still kind of young (but it happened while I was in HS) and I just don't remember any kind of nudie bar involved in the movie.
Tim is such an excellent actor he could have ran a Florist Shop and still come off as the bad guy.
Even though it has shocking and sometimes stomach turning scenes, it can still be funny and make you laugh.
Leslie is still grateful to Bogart but she rejects his possessiveness, and he leaves her forever with Ida Lupino.
Maybe it's a case of "so bad it's good," maybe I'm just partial to Van Damme, or maybe it's because I still have that promotional "Double Team" baseball cap from working in a theater.
VHS copies are still available and the movie has appeared on IFC.
Forget the fact that like any Van Damme movie, all character and plot development are non-existent, this movie still finds a way to suck to a new level.
Even though Huston was getting old at this point, he was still tackling challenging material in his old age, which possibly explains the odd mix of provocative, dense material with stilted, unintuitive storytelling.
And for those who are still with us: The sound mixing is the worst I was forced to listen to in years.
And for those who are still deaf and are wondering when they see people dancing.... 'Nowhere' is about the direction-less kind of life and thinking, people in general, have.
But even still, I can think of no reason why such a talented actress had to stoop to something this low.
Apparently, Miss West wasn't too keen on having these four stealing her limelightÂ However, she did approve of her leading men who, of course, are requested to still be lusting helplessly after Mae Â an aristocratic Timothy Dalton (who gets to sing a duet with Mae and whose remarks are frequently misinterpreted in the press!)
West, having enjoyed a late film career resurgence with 1970's "Myra Breckinridge", made one final celluloid splash before her death (at least, it is widely reported that she was still alive while filming this!)
Sure, there's nothing redeeming here but I still love this movie.
But I have to give Mae West credit for still marketing that same image at that age.
While the movie is certainly presented tongue in cheek, it still relies to heavily on the idea that Mae West at 85 is somehow still a desirable sexy vamp.
Despite being based on a short story, the material here is still painfully underdeveloped with major dramatic portions of the story left untouched.
this movie is not that great.i found the story too banal(ordinary).there's not much originality here.it's a combination of many other movies.it's equal parts a Christmas Carol,It's a Wonderful Life,How the Grinch Stole Christmas,and Even The Cat in the Hat movie.the movie isn't very funny,but there is a bit of slapstick that works.this movie is,i felt,overly sentimental and preachy.in fact,i felt like i was watching a 90 minute commercial on how important family is.now,don't get me wrong.family is very important.i just find that subtlety works best with these movies.this was just way too heavy handed for me.but there is some good news.the movie has a great visual style.i mean,it looks fantastically magical.and Martin Short is terrific as Jack Frost,the baddie of the piece.he's not really scary,more mildly disconcerting than anything,and even a bit sad.i also like the look they gave him.this movie is also a bit of a tearjerker.anyway,this is a case of style over substance.and while it's not nearly as mean spirited or creepy as part 2,i still don't think it was as good.the negatives just outweigh the positives.for me,The Santa Clause 3 is a 4/10
The plot was something pulled out of a 1st graders Christmas story he made for a school project(of course this story would still fail even for grade 1).
It was one of the few Christmas movies that still holds up for me.
This is twelve years later and the kid is still in high school.
The third film I went to see with my girlfriend at a dollar theater and still walked out feeling like I wasted two bucks.
So while there is no sign of Uwe Bohl directing (not nearly enough copious amounts of blood) nor any appearance of Wings Hauser (who probably would have fit well), this movie still sucks.
But in the end, there is still something lacking (and probably at my age, I would no longer find it all that funny) in a tale of an obsessive, overbearing father trying to prevent his teenagedaughter from participating in the dating game.
And while this comes as a shock to her father at first, despite the insistence of his girlfriend, Janet (Catherine Hicks) that this is all normal for the girl and in fact, good for her, he is still unconvinced and becomes not only paranoid, but soon enters therapy.
Yet, I'm sure it is still a favorite among 80s nostalgics (although, I'll pass on this one).
I think my tolerance for Mickey's bad acting was higher (but still not all that high).
It's still kind of cute in its own way, but once again, whatever "gags" are here are ruined by MGM's bad sense of pacing.
With all the fun to be had, there's still a strong apocalyptic feel in the air, like something bad is going to happen, which Dark finds depressing.
"Nowhere" just might frighten you at the most unexpected time, and even if you aren't frightened or disturbed, you'll still be thinking "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?".
This is all I really wanted to say about the film, however, since I need more lines, I'll just say certain aspects of the movie are alternately funny, sad, strange and still relevant today.
I'm betting twenty or thirty years from now, it will still seem up-to-date and probably still relevant.
I just finished watching this show and my mouth is still agape.
Even if there were no other wives involved, every molecule in my body would've still been screaming, "Don't do it lady!!!"
And of course, at last, the commando leader catches up with the terrorist, still dragging the hostage behind by the wrist and they face off on a suspension bridge.
It's a shame that such a top rate cast was let down by the insane camera-work and direction.Quick cutting has it's place,Natural born killers and the Bourne trilogy are enhanced by it because it furthers the story, but you are still able to actually focus on the characters.This rubbish is so quickly cut you are't given the chance to appreciate the acting or follow the plot.The director should definitely never work again.
But flies on a wall have one perspective, because they are sitting still on a wall.
What's really important are those frames showing that Janie is still wealthy in spite of her tragedies.
It would've worked better if Blair Underwood were still a great guy until the end, exemplifying the patience, sincerity and charming qualities that made Brian the winner, and then some.
Now where do I start, well I know comedy movies can be disgusting and gross like in Scary Movie and it can still be funny, but not with this movie.
Some is so bad it is only embarrassing, but then again, there are a few jokes which are still pretty bad, but where I couldn't help myself and laugh a little.
This is hardly a criticism Â while still on the unpredictability drive, Araki even throws in a large reptilian alien, just to see what happens.
Ultimately in the end not worth the effort or your precious time.What still amazes me though, is how in hell did IMDb give this movie a 7 out of 10??
And for those who still like to watch it, the remake did nothing more than colorize it and substitute a decidedly less gifted actor in the lead role.
However, that a Jeep could be beat up by a mutant genius bear bent on revenge, rolled down a hill and still drive for miles is absolutely believable.
But it's still GREAT.
And I don't even want to comment on the car which over heats, flips, and amazingly enough still runs.
As the sub-par Fast and the Furious style credits sequence shot past with a low rent nu-metal band playing in the background, I was still reasonably sober but could feel the effects of two purple nightmares (look them up) taking effect and knew that soon, I would be swimming in a haze of my own creation.
You can get attacked by a bear, rolled off a cliff in a car, thrown spine first onto a bear trap and spend all day battling for survival on a sun parched strip of mid-western wilderness and still have better skin and hair than Andie McDowell.
Smashed land rovers will still run for miles if rolled down a small hill to gather momentum.
I understand that King's novel was over 1,000 pages long, and the writers couldn't fit all of those details in one movie, but I still feel strongly that they could've replaced some of the crappy scenes in the movie, with some of the horrific parts in the book.
This movie was still very terrifying to me, and it's one of my favorite films, as well as my favorite novel.
This wasn't as unclear as Stan's cleanliness issue, but it was still a little blurry.
Instead, there is no forced promise; they do it themselves, cutting their palms with a glass Coke bottle and making a blood pact that they would return if It was still alive.
"I saw this movie when I was a kid and I'm still scared," or "It's the best movie ever!"
The story introduces two middle-aged brothers still living in their secluded parental mansion and filling their days with, well, nothing reallyÂ except kidnapping random young girls and subjecting them to torturous games.
The mother is still watching over her boys, by the way, though she can only seen from behind or heard in the distance.
Apparently the title Schoolgirls in Chains was substituted with Abducted, but some censors still found copies with the original title and flipped.
But....it's still a lot better than The Forest.
His intensity, concentration and facial array are still finely honed, so what's a first-rate actor doing in dirge like this?
I still can't believe they have created a Star Wars ride without a single Jedi Knight, Sith Lord or light saber fight.
but still has time for some interracial bonding later, proving that lust conquers all.
But still, watching a loud, obnoxious cartoon feature with precious little to interest those over 9 is not really worth a chunk out of your day.
I watched it countless times as a kid and I don't think I ever knew what was going on, and I just realized I still don't.
You could just cut him out, cut out all the live-action stuff, told the whole movie as just a straight cartoon, and still have the same story.
While this film deals with a lesser known extinction level event, the science is still dubious as presented.
NYPD Blue started that awful trend, and while NYPD Blue was strangely still a hit (but not as big at it would have been had it been well shot!)
So for a rather light Richard Pryor comedy that still has some good laughs, give this movie a try.
The last flashback too is prolonged and also the entire clash between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu  N Chandra disappoints Music is okay, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out  Govinda tries a negative role and does very well in it though he overdoes it too much at times Karisma is good but irritates at times with her cries Tabu is okay Nirmal Pandey still doesn't know the difference between loud screaming and acting rest are okay
He'll have more drive, and make her "proud", but she'll still be bored hanging around the house waiting for him to return from work.
(He didn't know another would come along from the opposite direction and almost kill them for really-real, but it's still funny right?)
Still though, for all its faults (there's plenty), it's still kind of fascinating at times, in a "why am I watching this?"
While it's not as bad as declaring 'worst film of the year', it's still pretty lousy.
I'm 3/4 the way through and still waiting for just a hint of something original that I have not seen before (employment woes, civilian misconceptions, drug and alcohol abuse, slams against the VA -yawn).
I knew going into it that this film was probably not going to be some engaging, powerful war drama, but still something to leave audiences satisfied.
But at least Riggs and Murtaugh were still Lethal Weapons, THAT was the whole point in the films being so called right?
From the Schizophrenic SAAB driver, to the scary next door neighbour you can't get away from fast enough, to the dog who you have to put a mirror under it's nose to see if he's still breathing!
b) Daryl Hannah, still looking gorgeous, but no sexy scenes at all, just farcical groping and snogging, and c) Tom Berenger, a great guy to have in an action movie, and d) Romanian women, the second-best looking women in Europe(after Slovenia).
Bill Gunn artsy attempts to disguise the lack of budget with various ingenious camera angles and sound effects, but he still can't hide the fact there's no suspense or involvement in the screenplay.
It's still quite fun, but if they don't make movies like this any more, there is a reason for it.
But, overall, you still leave the movie feeling somewhat bemused, let down, and on the whole, dissatisfied with it.
Mitchum found the brother's body, no blood, no nothing, even still has color in his face!
On still other occasions, Objects that were supposed to be white appear on screen as being pink.
Sorry, Betty Grable was still the queen of the legs department.
They meet and say nothing, they do not meet but talk by cell phone, still saying nothing.
The acting was not good in either movie, but still nowhere near as bad as "Leigion of the Dead".
He proves that even if you don't say a word you can still overact.
I actually saw this before I saw Dial M for Murder, but although this was a good story I still found the original better.
It still has a good plot.
While not as good as some of his previous films, The World is still an excellent movie.
I grant this, but much more still could have been done with it.
Even now, I can still hardly believe how bad it really is.
I remember liking this film as a child, so at least on that level Thumbelina is a success for it is a film aimed for the children, but whilst many Disney films can still hold some of their magic for the older audiences, that is where Thumbelina falls down for once the viewer reaches the age where they become critical, then this film will give them much to be negatively critical about.
It has been years since my experience but it is still a vivid memory.
We`re shown that despite being unsophisticated and non white European they are still capable of being noble , loving and caring members of the human race .
The act of union between England and Scotland didn`t happen until 1707 while the St Patrick cross of Ireland wasn`t added to the flag until later still so considering this movie is set in 1620 it`s totally wrong .
I spent half the movie wondering why the hell he was still in Cuba, and the other half of the movie waiting for him to die or be killed or die.
Characters are not well developed, even Arenas is still something of a cipher by the end of the film, and the supporting players are not given any depth at all.
It's probably still pretty easy, right?
I'm still here!".
They often are borderline insipid, clichÃ©d, predictable, and dull-witted, but those that aren't completely inept still manage to entertain to varying degrees.
which aired on Fox several years ago was a Twister copy-cat, but was still half-way decent.
I was pleased to see Mike Ironsides still in the movie biz.
I think he could have thrown in a few more drops of rabid drool for fun, but still, it was acceptable for a demented scientist role.
I started watching this movie when SyFy broadcast it a few years back, but couldn't get past the scene where the guy's intestines literally fell out of his stomach (not terribly realistic, but still a bit upsetting).
Add in the stereotypical science project goes wrong plot and "band of everyday heroes" that save the day and you've got a film that you could do yourself the favour and just NOT watch and still know what will happen at the end.
But still it's just so tiresomely predictable that it's hard to make it through to the end.
Most imbecilic scenes: some magma burps a skull out, landing near some horrified witnesses, it's still (no, I'm not kidding) smoking like a piece of burnt toast.
While this film is radically different from Jia's earlier films it still packs the same cultural criticism wallop.
As adults (they are played by Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis and Timothy Olyphant) they still have the powers and that is where the movie begins.
Some of the scenes unspool without editing for several minutes, the camera mostly still, sometimes moving with the action but never on the whim of the filmmaker.
This ride was WAY ahead of its time when it was new, and is still a great ride and lots of fun.
I still wonder WHY so many people say this is a good film.
During the period such B-movies in this very overworked genre usually are still turning up clues, this solves the mystery.
Coming to the movie, the plot was an oft repeated one of two cops pairing up, both different in personas (infact diametrically opposite), and still great pals, one has a wife and kids and other is single and hot, the usual clichÃ©s.
Just about everyone in this enterprise deserved to be praised, but it's still a rotten film.
But after that slog out, it still has a 'few' amusingly stupid merits throughout its shoddiness and vapid moments.
Even when his flashbacks are of new footage, they're still boring, and extremely poorly acted.
How many ways can you do the revenge plot and still keep it interesting and thought provoking?
Then it gets back to Ricky being adopted and seemingly OK--but the events he witnessed as a child are still with him and--at the age of 18--he snaps and goes on a killing rampage.
Yes he DID try to rape her beforehand but still... And when Ricky and his fiancÃ©e go to the movies they end up seeing the first movie which means we get to see it TWICE!
It doesn't go much lower than the movie theatre sequence, but there are still plenty more examples of stupidity sprinkled throughout the rest of the film.
By 'hooks up' I mean they hold hands or something, this being a Christian movie, so we never figure out if his parts still work.
La dee da....zombie boy takes a bullet for the girl or something (I'm still pretty sure she doesn't even give him a kiss as thanks or anything), it turns out blondie actually DOES have the mark and she was just pretending to be a Chrisitan pretending to have the mark (?).
Grace Kelly was still probably with a swell-head for her undeserved Oscar win, the year before, for "The Country Girl."
A low budget, badly acted film............ everything about this film is poorly staged, wooden acting by C list actors and unbelievable settings, I'm still watching this as I write........... OMG so awful.
He's dead (immediately pull sheet over head LOL)  I'm still cringing as I write this, if second graders presented this as a home movie I would expect better acting (and sets :) )  Please, let me write this comment without having to make up ten lines about a film that doesn't even deserve one!!!!!
The second film was more entertaining than funny - but it was still good and the characters were strong.
What they made was a movie so horribly unfunny that five years after seeing it, I still use it as a measuring stick for movie futility.
I'm going to start with the good parts, see, Eddie Murphy is still great as Axel and is always very funny.
The comedy added to the action but the movie was still about the good guys vs. bad guys.
I would like to say it might do okay in the Direct-to-DVD market, but I'd still end up hitting the fast forward button.
The first two in the series were fairly simple, fun films, relying mainly on Eddie Murphy's performances but nevertheless with strong backup from the rest of the cast (particularly in the first one), and a certain eighties 'cool' factor that, while obviously dated, still charms.
De Wald secretly leads a complex money printing scheme within the park and Foley, still seeking revenge for Tood's death, defies the wishes of the FBI and goes after him in his own, unique way.
Murphy feels out-of-sorts while Reinhold still has the wide-eyed look of someone who is surprised that they're acting in a film at all.
I'm really surprised that she is the lead actress in this movie, I mean it has independent written all over it, but still she is atrocious, many of the extras could probably have done the role/movie more justice.
Needless to say it is still on our list to catch when at the Disney parks.
Considering the technology at the time it came out, it is still the foundation by which other "sim" rides attempt to duplicate.
She was lying dead but they still used her for the voice-over.
I still need an answer as to why I watched this entire film.
Even though the movie deals with more serious issues, it's still very funny and you laugh a lot.
the graphics and animation are excellent and its nice to see the whole gang in CG form Sephiroth's still cool  now the reasons it only got a 4 well the characters feel like planks of wood with some of the worst voice acting I've ever seen(I've watched epic movie)  the movie just seems cloud orientated so much so that it make even the fans embarrassed with cloud this and cloud that.
- After six weeks of evacuations, there are still people waiting at the airport when the big day comes.
SRK then races to the hospital to see if the woman is still alive, where he pretends to be her husband in order to save her life.
Daryl Somers refused to change the format of the show (like the bosses/fans kept telling him he should) and so it got axed (yet he was still suprised).
By then, the show was rating in single figures, which is no small feat for a country that has only five free-to-air television channels, and still thinks impediments to its recording industry like Molly Meldrum are relevant.
If the writers were abreast with colorful subtext, or the least bit clever in their abilities, the movie still may have recovered from this flaw.
Man, I'm still hurting!
Ok, Basinger still looks good in her upper 40's, and I applaud her at not using tons of facelifts like most of Hollywood past 40, but that's the only reason this film gets a 1/10 from me!
Romantics will still gush and choke up at this story.
Critics will still hold noses and give Bronx cheers.
Valentino was a tango dancer and a gigolo but he still had dreams of buying his own orange grove in California.
Soon Valentino becomes a screen sensation and he becomes involved romantically with Rambova but technically he is still married to his first wife.
This was still early in his career, but his use of inventive angles and a moving camera showed brilliance.
The look of the film is rather stylish, but still it's a hysterically formulaic piece that overplays itself.
Indian film industry is still trying to come out of the bad drug that it got infected with.
Sorry I saw it only after 2 years and it was still running full, and I din't like it.
And I forgave my friend for wasting my time, but I still have the runs.
While still not nearly as good as the original, as least it did not look like a deliberate parody of the show!!
This, however, would still be excusable.
However, the movie still is very good, and one wouldn't realize flaws unless you go deep into the movie like me.
This was a shame because the dubbing for the dialog actual was one of the better efforts I've heard from this era - the dialog is still stilted and clumsy, but it seemed as if the ESL voice actors might have been allowed to actually rehearse a little before they had to jump into the studio.
The writer of Thika still doesn't understand why they had to go.
It is still ironic how the 'inferior' Kikuyu have managed to get all the good land, while the 'superior' Masai managed to only get land fit for cattle herding.
Remember that in 1981, Zimbabwe had only been free for 2 years, and that Apartheid was still the system of the day in both Namibia and South Africa.
Well, I still remain a fan and don't blame her for this 'spy game' drek, but still, what were they thinking?
I'm still actually wondering what her official mission was, or did I miss something?
Magical realism requires a deft directorial hand and a great screenplay that can present you with the absurd but still make you believe it.
With such mystical tension and drama leading up to his deep dark secret, I am still left wondering :So your great grandpa gave you a magic feather...and???
However I still watched the film till end.
- Unnecessary voice-overs, really got to me As I said, if you go in with no expectations at all, you could well enjoy it, but its still a poorly made film.
Watching Dan (Brett Butler) try to sneak his old mattress out his ex-girlfriend's apartment was pretty damn funny (note: this is attempted while his ex is still in the apartment).
HELLBOUND was a rather plot less runaround but was still reconisably Barker inspired .
The first was HELLRAISER: DEADER, which was better than the average direct-to-video release, but still not nearly as good as HELLRAISER was.
We're in a perpetual state of not knowing what we're supposed to be concerned about until 80 minutes into the film, when instead of revealing the answers to the mystery by making connections in our mind for ourselves, we're dealt a five minute scene of the villain saying, "Let me explain my dastardly plan that's been going on for the last 80 minutes, that you as an audience were completely unaware of, while you watched random scenes that still don't make any sense or have any connection to the plot, even after I've explained it."
No matter how sure I am that something is going to spring out in a situation like that it still gets to me.
His friends later mourn that they all knew what was happening to him but still kept playing Hellworld, although if you watch the making-of featurettes on the DVD, Director Rick Bota refers to Hellworld as "a website, or video game."
At one point, still very early in the film, the male lead character can be seen reading a copy of Jules Verne's legendary novel "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea" and even later in the film the book is mentioned several times more.
Given that the National Board of Reviewers ranked "Closer" as the third best movie of 2004 (behind "The Aviator" and "Finding Neverland"), I'm still stunned at how patently ridiculous it was.
It's not the genre it's the style with which it is done - audiences will watch Indy climb onto a submarine and still be on it hours later because the care about Indy and are engaged by the film.
Shahin still insists on using songs & dances in his films which alienate viewers from the serious continuity of the film, when it exists.
I really tried hard watching it at different times but still, it's almost unbearable to watch.
One could still see the potential for greatness that would follow.
The attraction is a decent, if not great ride, and even though the only character in ride you see is R2, you will still hear some memorable quotes, and see memorable faces during the preflight safety videos.
Though still amateurish, any attempts of a B-movie being 'stylish' differentiates it from a movie shot with a home video camera, and that is okay in my book, at least in that respect.
Though, it wasn't as stupid as others I've witnessed on the screen (there are a couple, surprisingly crude jokes that are somewhat amusing...at least they're right with the times, that's all I'll say), it still had way too many groaners, and was way too predictable.
I am glad to have learned the following 1) tequila can cure anything, 2) that body shots can perform miracles, 3)Joey Lawrence is still alive, and 4) that dreams really can come true in America because apparently anyone will give anybody a bunch a money to make anything no matter how crappy it is.
How can the Enterprise drop the warp core yet still make it back in time to save Picard?
There a nonsensical subplot about him still being upset about his ex-girlfriend, the lesbian who is bringing all of her lesbian friends to be impregnated by Jack, but only after her.
At the risk of sounding like some typical jerk, for such a thing to be torturous to a man we need to have a real, real good reason for him to hate doing it, and still being upset about a relationship that ended nearly half a decade earlier isn't even close to reason enough.
I'm still wondering whether is was good or not...
And even when this muddled mess comes to its conclusion, there is still a blatant lack of satisfaction with where it has gone.
Better still, I feel like kicking David Ayer in the groin.
I am still thinking about it!
I mean I didn't see it coming or anything but it was still stupid and the acting isn't very good in the film either but I don't look at that as much if its a good story but this movie was just a plain old sleeper compared to the awesome horror films I have seen in the past.
but if you do like comedy and medieval then  watch it if you don't like that just see if you like still i did not like this movie and wish it was never made!!!
But at the end, the light is still gray and smoking... with a: "look who's dunnit again!"
I'm still on edge.
The film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.)
The phantom-parenting of Dexter/DX and the fact he still cares for DX's mother is a conundrum in the view that Gene is married to a white woman (Who does not wash her hands after using the bathroom, nasty!
There is still footage missing, but that doesn't matter a great deal as, alas, the photoplay is boring enough as it is.
It always gives me hope to know that there are still Canadian executives who, like Diane Boehm, are prepared to take a chance on Canadian talent that is relatively unknown in our so-called "mainstream", simply because it is Canadian.
But it's still enjoyable.
For that matter, I was still confused about half of the characters in the scene.
After being threatened with the kidnap and rape of her child, she still goes on television telling her story, it became obvious to me that this is not the tale of a hero, but the story of the self-obsessed idiot who only cared for her own career.
films like Apocalypse Now still looks absolutely fantastic even today but every time i give born on the fourth of July another try it gets worse.
Rothrock has one fight which is good and she still kicks but like the best of them, whilst showing her ample jubilee off in a cleavage boosting low cut dress.
The film is still reasonably fun though because it is so cheesy and they have some clichÃ©d and hokey drama in it that is so badly done you can't help but laugh.
I'm still trying to come up with a good reason for this character to exist, and I'm not finding one.
That I still came away very disappointed should speak volumes of the lowly piece of trash I was treated to.
A fake Prince William turns up, fluffs some line, but it was in keeping with the rest of the acting so nobody really notices and the ironing board and the bad boy, who clearly hasn't done anything bad except forget to send a birthday card get together Â hurrah you should say  We both could have cried, not at the appalling script/acting/Directing/ (I would say delete where applicable, but they all are) but that it cost Â£3Âstill it looks like by our single purchase they recovered all their budget.
If you don't understand me let me break it down, for example (this does happen in the movie) problem: they realize the Icarus 1 is still orbiting around the sun, there is a distress call and the crew of the Icarus 2 believe there could be someone still there, or they could take the bomb from the Icarus one and use it in case their bomb doesn't work to restart the sun.
There's nothing really good about the movie, but its still interesting (for a while).
If it delivers at only 10% we would still be treated with the best SF in decades.
The beginning doesn't ruin what now can still be hopeful expectations.
But wait, maybe I'm astray, lost from Sunshine's ambitious path...  Not invited by the movie itself, but by a state of boredom, stubbornly still not fully convinced of Sunshine's dark failure I start to wonder about possible philosophical implications the makers may have intended when abandoning simple movie conventions that enable viewers to see what's in front of the camera and to follow what's going on.
There is however still some attraction in seeing it for its good looks and missed potential.
While still not absolutely crushing the movie, the characters themselves certainly ensured it could never get a rating better than "semi-decent".
Even with the above massive stupidities (which seem to be the main driving force for the movie's plot) the movie still would have had a chance for maybe 3 or 4 out of 10, but alas, it was not to be.
It could have still gotten 2/10 at this point, at least it would be reminiscent of a great movie, but at this point the plot turns to "We need to kill crew members to conserve oxygen!"
At this point my mind wandered to how this movie could have gotten one extra star if it had asked an interesting question, such as if humanity is worth saving if it will so readily kill it's own (still a questionable question).
Nothing much happens until the crew discovers that the ship from the first mission is still orbiting the sun.
Naturally someone is still alive on the original spaceship.
The movie is made like a B-movie, with a B-cast & crew but still the movie is visually looking like an A-list movie.
Oh well, at least it still had Jeffrey Combs in it.
This was a waste of 99 minutes, even if there is a unrated version I still think that it would stink.
I still remember a scene in which the female leader character was talking about her rape when she was a child and she defines the raper as "The soft man", everybody laughed at that and the dubbing of the Spanish actress Monica Van Campen was so ridiculous that again everybody laughed when she talked (Despite her undoubtful beauty.
Yes, I still don't know if I like it: Divoff was right as M, I liked him.
Jeffrey Combs still is the man, although it hurts to see him being downgraded straight to the supportive cast.
Curse your Oscar grade acting and damn you for still being sexy after all these years!
A psychologist,Jade(Isabel Brook, a stunning beauty) who uses music to get inside what makes the mad crazy, soon becomes a chess-piece between Divoff's Lucifer and Faust(still John at this point).
(And don't get me wrong this movie is BAD, but its occasionally as low as you can go in badness and still be enjoyable in a jaw dropping sort of way.)
He eventually turns to her, still crying, and there is an overhead shot of their naked interracial bodies intertwined.
This is an absolutely horrible movie (though still better than both Queerwolf and On Deadly Ground (best use of Michael Caine's hair to sop up oil spills)).
Taken as a parody of the genre it fares a bit better, but it's still deficient insofar as it's not so much funny as painful, and badly paced at that.
The acting was decent, assuming that several actors were still kids.
These are just my ravings: even if you could get the actors to return, the reputation of the original would still be there.
And Hazel Croney should be very grateful that with such a think foreign accent, she was still allowed to dub her own lines for the film.
Frank a hard working son of an English born mother must face hardships with the Italian community in New York and still uphold mockery from his Polish brethren.
It was an interesting twist on the old Shakespeare poem but I still think it could have been A LOT better!
Obviously this movie is not for Shakespeare purists but neither is it for anyone with a few still active brain cells.
But Matt Czuchry is still really hot!
Even after "Scotty Farkus" had been burned hard by a casting agent he still believed that a shady guy from "back East" was going to fund their movie and were shocked when it turned out he was just snowing them.
If any directors want to have a good movie despite his bad editing, Kubrick's movie was a bit long, not well edited in many scenes, he still won the day because his premise for the story was strong and plot elements were there to prove his premise, which buildup to a strong message or a theme of the overall masterpiece, which we can sum up in few words, such as in Dr. Strangelove, that an accidental holocaust can happen.
If you for any reason still want to see it you'll probably survive, but you'll never be able to make up for the lost hour and a half.
He has handled some scenes well but has still a long way to go.
The Joy of Sex had just been published, Aids was still many years away...what carnal delights could be had in those bell-bottomed, glammed up times?
Timmy puts it about but he finds himself falling for the blond Liz (no English Bardot but still light years out of his league) who inevitably takes a dim view of her boyfriend eying up nude school girls and so forth.
You can probably tell I've just finished watching it, the adrenaline is still pumping through my veins, my wry smile still plastered across my face.
I'm still trying to figure out the point of it all.
Joe Dalessandro and Sylvia Krystel were top sex symbols at the time "La marge" was made; the former still had the infamous Warhol trilogy stamped all over him , while the latter had found stardom a couple of years earlier with the legendary "Emanuelle".
Ultimately you couldn't careless what happened to Watts and company and I still don't know what happened since it became so excruciating that I called a halt to proceedings with less than 10 minutes to go.
There's nothing physically impressive about either of them: indeed I had hoped and still believe that someone like Tim Roth could've throttled them to within an inch of their lives, golf club or not!
17 years later, it still works as well as it did 17 years ago, brilliant.
This is just what I suppose we can call a perfect popcorn movie, the kind of movie where you lean back and just let the thrill ride begin, you know things will end happily, but still it entertains for the 2 hours it lasts, and it entertains at a very high level.
This is a really great action classic, an unforgettable movie that never gets old, no matter how many times you watch it, this must be like the 5th time for me, and it's still highly entertaining, it has no slow moments and just moves out there at a perfect pace for 2 hours.
However, at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable.
No, Chaplin as the cute Little Tramp was still evolving.
This film is still exciting to watch and I definitely recommend it for this upcoming holiday season (as they play many Christmas songs throughout)!
A kidnapper is apprehended by the police, but the young girl he abducted is still missing.
The police bring a medium onto the case to see if she can contact the girl's spirit, or at least determine whether the girl is still alive.
Once at the Christmas party, he learns that his wife, Holly, still uses her maiden name, and meets Ellis, the womanizing, cocaine snorting, co-worker of Holly.
He's still an evil man who will kill anyone if it serves his purpose.
But there was still enough to keep me interested, and I thought that if I could see the problems of Season 2, then surely the writers could see them as well.
Die Hard, one of the greatest action movies of all time, still to this day, it's more impressive than ever.
When i brought it home i began to watch it, and i have to admit the opening scene, while not as scary as i remember, still holds up as being a truly terrifying moment in the film.
One of the best action thrillers ever made, Die Hard still rocks like a thunderstorm nearly twenty years after it was first released; often copied and arguably never, ever equalled, this film introduced the set-up of the lone cop/soldier/tough guy against a team of terrorists who have taken over a secured area.
Despite a raging indifference to the acting chops of Carol Kane--I still can barely stand to watch "Taxi" largely due to her annoying grate--I decided to give "When A Stranger Calls" a chance.
But although their hearts are in the right place, I still have to say that they're wrong.
Those poor animators...  Poorer still are the Canadian Tax-payers who flipped the bill for this one.
The style still looks like it was fished out of Burton's recycling bin, the main character is more grating than necessary and there are the usual comedy ensemble stereotypes.
Still not even close to his performance in Angus, still it's interesting to see him older.
The film then really starts to go into its own as we follow an average police officer from New York in LA trying to just to get home for Christmas, still more about this film.
Upon noticing that the building is being taken over by terrorists John escapes and heads to the top floor with work is still going on, and sets off the fire alarm in an attempt to get the police there.
They go that one more to make it fun and try to make the story still remain simple.
But I'm not giving it the lowest because there were still some elements that could've been worse.
Jesse (Jonathon Trent) has always been interested in the hotel & drawn to the mystery surrounding the still unsolved murders, he has convinced some of his high school mates to accompany him, during the middle of the night of course because going there during the day when it was light would just be silly.
Written & directed by Cartney Wearn I watched Pray for Morning last night without knowing a thing about it, the title is rather vague & could have referred to anything so I didn't go into it with any great expectation yet I still found myself disappointed & not particularly having a good time.
Who would ever think that power would still be connected to an old abandoned hotel, yet they try the breakers and presto, they have lights!!
It must be so easy to maintain an indoor pool, after so many years the water is clear and the pool is still full to boot, I have a hard enough time keeping mine clean on a weekly basis!!
Though miles better than the (awful) first game this still suffers from major bore.
It is one of those movies that could play every weekend and would still be watched.
I'm still holding my sides!
This second chapter is less repulsive than the original, but still contains more than enough sequences to make your stomach turn.
But without editing you still end up with a steaming pile of cow dung.
Character development is superb, and even though Stuart and De Souza leave some loose ends untied - like how a man gets hung with a chain and still comes back for more - the film remains to be an action classic.
Ten years later, he was still making good movies along the likes of "Mystery, Alaska" and the decent remake of "The Longest Yard".
Then he joins his crew and travel from Italy to Paris chasing the last greatest European clowns still live in these countries.
Older kids will despise this, unless it has a nostalgia factor to them, which it does to me, and I still hate it.
The film still is all about the images though, and right from the start you know it's a Tsukamoto when you see his trademark: Maggots eating some rotten flesh.
Living in Bristol where Blackbeard lived and drank in a pub that still stands today, I thought I would give this a try.
Karate Cop is a title that makes little sense, since while Richard Marchini knows martial arts and is a futuristic law enforcer, being that there is obviously no law in this phony futuristic scenario, can one still be considered a police officer, if you no longer have a public to serve?
The films has some sort of charm but it drags (I nodded off to sleep a time or two) and there really isn't much going for this film, but amazingly, I have still seen worse.
I eventually skipped to the "action" parts and this movie still came up empty handed.
Just try to envision an R rated Power Rangers movie (which still sounds better than this movie) and see what you think of "CRAP", I mean "Kibakihchi".
Scenes stretch out forever and at several points in the film, the pacing stops at a stand still.
Continued: for the people who have been bashing my comment:  You're right, this wasn't a horror movie, but it was still complete and utter garbage that contained no suspense, terrible acting, a stupid killer, awfully done death scenes, and not one hint of hope that anything good could come out of whoever made this heap of trash.
This, however, would still be excusable.
Tsukamoto has always brought a collection of directorial styles, his camera can sit still, smoothly glide, follow the actions of a situation feverishly..whatever is taking place in the story, Tsukamoto has a certain way of conveying it.
This was a shame because the dubbing for the dialog actual was one of the better efforts I've heard from this era - the dialog is still stilted and clumsy, but it seemed as if the ESL voice actors might have been allowed to actually rehearse a little before they had to jump into the studio.
How can one man continually create such irritatingly grating roles one after another and still be allowed to make more movies ?
Having read on the film I knew what was happening and yet I still had to entertain numerous other possibilities.
Time stood still, and not in a good way.
Granted, the 1959 Hammer version and the 1982 flick with Ian Richardson aren't much more faithful, but they each have an excellent Holmes - Cushing remains my favourite, as he rescued Holmes from the cliche which Rathbone made him, and Richardson has an airiness which still seems refreshing compared to Brett's ham-and-more-ham approach.
The previews should have warned me what to expect but I still watched it.
With all displays of Holmes' deductive reasoning dropped (even the famous scene with Dr Mortimer's walking stick is gone), his disguises omitted (he just appears on the moor as if he were still dressed for Baker Street) and his drug use wildly overdone (rather than resorting to narcotics when bored, he even jacks up in a public toilet while working on the case in this version), he's such a blunt bull in a China shop here that rather than pay the cabby for information, he beats him up instead as if he were a 19th century Popeye Doyle.
And yet, this is still a parable about Japanese society, which has a strangely universal-appeal.
Still, even with its many shortcomings, it still was a long way from 50 worst territory.
I wish there were still shows like this now.
Its sad and pathetic but still rather humorous watching the film makers trying to co-opt the religion of the Jews as they cram Old Testament harshness into modern American Fairyland.
So I thought to all who are wanting to see it ( Australians, unless it's still not released else-where) To do something constructive with the time you would spend with this film.
I didn't give it a lower vote because with all its flaws it still entertained me for a while (it was a Sunday night).
I'm with everyone here astonished that this film's still not available for personal acquisition.
I can still feel this film in my blood, though it must be 20 years since I last saw it.
The movie was only ninety minutes long, but i swear the hands on the clock stood still as this abomination continued to unfurl its tenticles on my mind.
The prime example of this theory would be the American Ninja Series (I-IV anyway, V is still unwatchable).
It is terrible, cheesy, low-budget, slow, and although it has such an incredibly innane straight out of Thundercats plot, still manages to be one of the most confusing films I've ever seen.
Even if you don't put much thrust in the police (as they claim in the movie) you still can act on your own, and I am talking here about him as a protector of his daughter and as a protector of his own skin - for God's sake, that kid RAPED HIS DAUGHTER , BROKE HIS HEAD AND SET HIM ON FIRE TO DIE !!!
The film does highlight some great obscure films I still haven't seen but surprising shows no footage whatsoever from the Z channel itself.
I remember finally getting a pair of all white-leather roller boots, hard to come by over here, but they were the best present ever - I still have them and they still fit and I hope to be wearing them when I teach my niece how to skate too!
when i saw the trailer to this film i had high hopes and then when i found out that Mark Jones was behind it i figured it would be good i loved the first leprechaun but even though the trailer was good sadly thats about the only good thing about the film, it trys to hard to be funny and you just start feeling sorry a quarter of the way through asking yourself why am i still watching this maybe it might get better I've seen it all the way and let me answer that question with a big no.
To be fair to Triloquist the film moves along like a rocket & there are few dull moments but with such a bad story, such unfunny jokes & gags which miss by the proverbial mile & an extremely unlikable central character it's still an incredibly difficult film to either like or enjoy.
Did Joe Don tell her the secret to being a hatchet face that still gets cast as a romantic lead?
Maybe will bore some, but still got it's cheesy magic.
The current definition of heroism now encapsulates twenty guys rushing one teenager with a box-cutter and a fake bomb, and after discovering the bomb to be fake, still beating the teenager to death Â heroically, of course Â with no trial.
Whilst the Towers were still upright and smoking, somewhere in Hollywood, a movie exec's amoral mind was ticking over with shot angles and how to pitch this disaster as a theatrical release, while a television exec's mind was simultaneously projecting how much advertising time he could sell during a Movie of the Week based on this calamity.
The government told them so enough times --- in fact certain tenacious hardliners still do.
Pitt is a bad actor in this & still is a terrible actor now...The problem with this film is the acting, plot, setting, music etc.... Somewhere there was some potential for a campy/scary film , but unfortunately it seems to be more intune with an amateur gore hound & friends running amok with a second rate video camera.
The script is laughable and the actors try to do their best but still turns out bad.
I've always been a huge fan of hers and while her role is horribly written she is still breathtaking to watch and the best scene comes as she's doing her nails by the pool.
You can probably put this in the "It's so bad it's good" category and while it's always easy to just say this is crummy it's still a film that's exactly what it advertises.
"Cutting Class," however, still receives a failing grade in my book when you think the movie couldn't get any more tedious, when it reverts to type and descends into typical slasher/haunted house movie territory in the third act.
After doing five years of rehabilitation time, for killing his father, a still disturbed-looking Donovan Leitch (as Brian Woods) returns to town.
Schoelen, who played several roles like this, is also well past sixteen - but, bending over, she is still sweet.
Sometimes all that it requires to take your mind off of everything is a simple-minded, bone-headed 80's slasher, especially if it's one that stars a young, hunky and still unknown Brad Pitt as the high school jerk and Roddy McDowall as the dirty-minded principal.
The plot is textbook 80's guff, meaning no purposeful twists or any attempts at building up tension whatsoever, but still it guarantees a good 90 minutes of dopey fun and chuckles.
He is released into the general population (though obviously still unbalanced) and becomes the prime suspect in a series disappearances and murders among high school faculty and students.
His performance is very lacking, but fans of his might still check it out as his a main lead.
The plot is weak; that's there's not much to hang a story off (and still there are holes!)
A real lemon of a flick, but still I found this mindless slasher watchableÂ thank-you Schoelen.
Many films I enjoyed as a child still hold up wonderfully.
This show develops too slowly, and why are all the girls still so pretty with their hair done so nice with their make up and collagen lips and plastic hips after a nuclear holocaust?
Despite him being about 70 and giving them every chance to get it back, he still manages to smash the TV thingy and then all the evil folks start to melt like they are made of gallons of colored latex.
Naturally, I wasn't pleased and after drying it out, I hoped it would still work.
I know it's only a fantasy film but, still, if you know the slightest thing about baseball this movie can be annoying at times because ballplayers would NOT act like this.
My hart still starts thumping when I think about the episode.
She has a theory that Eddie is still alive and believes that the band may be on the verge of a renaissance, if the missing final recordings, named A Season in Hell, can be located.
I just picked up the soundtrack CD last Saturday, and after more than twenty years the classic Fifties-style songs with the unique Beaver Brown sound still hold up.
And Johnny, though successful at times, still seems like a major amateur.
He is the nice guy, the charming guy, but in the end, still a hopeless doofus.
I can still only give it 4/10 though.
He has to find a way to let people know he is still alive.
Time is running out and unless Callew can show he's still alive, he is going to be declared dead.
A rubber something was fixed across the back of the bird's head to no avail: it still looked a duck.
Despite regaining slight movement in a single finger, nobody seems to recognise that Callew is still alive, and he seems destined to be buried that way.
Three months later, Abe is still grieving and attempts suicide by overdosing on many pills at home, only to be rescued by his friend Marty Bloom (Adrian Holmes) and saved by doctors.
This sequel bears little similarity to it's predecessor, and in some ways it is an improvement, it certainly has a little bit more story to it, but as before, it is only good for the okay special effects, and it is still boring quite a lot.
Even if this movie had been cast with the greatest actors of our time it would still not be worth watching.
my partner got this on her Netflix and i was still upset to see it.
Even when the authorities and emergency workers arrive at the scene, he is still mistaken for a dead man.
And you still never once see any fire fighting equipment.
In reality your still going to recognize the same person.
I mean, he must be cheap... but still!
Even if you could get past the idea that these boring characters personally witnessed every Significant Moment of the 1960s (ok, so Katie didn't join the Manson Family, and nobody died at Altamont), this movie was still unbelievably awful.
Even so, I still found the sixty-nine minutes of this film rough going.
However, I still enjoy watching it despite the cheap props, lousy story, very horrid acting.
While is does not sink to the subterranean levels of Plan 9 or Robot Monsters, it is still a must see for all loyal turkey fans.
He constantly bickers about how he hates sponge bob and Pat and yet he still lives next to them.He's very pretentious and is very sad all the time.Every time I look at him he's gives you this suicidal mentality!!
so folks if you want to see this show you can but still stupid!
Right now, I'm in high school, and it still sucks today!!!
I liked every game show that were Nick when I was little, and I still watch them today.
The episodes were witty and funny, having jokes that people of all ages found funny while still keeping it innocent and clean.
Each episode was fresh and new, while still keeping it's old charm; but after a certain point things turned for the worse.
However, I will still like SpongeBob in the early years.
It was the first time I ever saw a fully naked women, I was male and 15.....and it was still only marganially entertaining.
April Lang as deranged hag Ms. Mayhew, Bill Jacobson as hulking disfigured brute Franklyn Mayhew, and Annie MacKay as tongueless daughter Angel are reasonably creepy, but they still aren't anywhere near as scary and disturbing as the cannibal clan in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (a horror classic that this crud shamelessly copies to the grating ninth degree).
Like...the police jeep...is right there as they leave the house trying to escape from the chainsaw killer...jeep is not damaged in any way, shape, or form...and still...they run.
If you still decide to rent - or God forbid - buy this movie just make sure your fast forward button is working.
But there are movies that are bad but still kind of good if you know what I mean.
I'm still amazed that this movie got distribution and a release.
Maybe youÂ´ll still watch it, despite my and other peopleÂ´s words, thatÂ´s what I did because I was curious to see if the Olsen twins had finally grown up...but it isnÂ´t worth it, trust me.
Ave in Cambridge, the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go, which should put me squarely in the nerd-who-would-obsessively-love-comic-book-films census group, and still I hated this film...).
Admittedly I'm not really a fan of comic-book-to-movie conversions so I didn't go in with many expectations, yet still I found Elektra to be incredibly underwhelming.
I'm also (still) scratching my head over the fate of Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa's character, which seems to have gone by unexplained.
By the halfway point, I had this film in my liked column, but then it just went on and on and on, in fact, even though I have left the theater, I still think the film is running.
I've read that this was based on a story originally by Ben Stein, who still finds the memory of the way it was slaughtered too painful to talk about.
The American first strike is still 1091 nukes that sounds like Pt 109 won the war and that says back off brics alliance.
It takes place in a backwoods liquor still.
I'm still trying to find out why a main character who is supposed to exude virility,gangsterism,and respect has a name called "Summer G"....Gosh, STUPID!!
Even though his character is the most vile, evil, manipulative, and ultimately unlikeable person in the entire film, he still manages to give an awesome performance and show what acting is all about.
Old feelings still there, what will happened next??
Nothing to original about it, but still could make for an interesting story.
Technically, I am a Boomer, though at the time when all the "idealistic youths" of the '60s were reading Marx, burning their draft cards, and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in grade school.
Luckily, Bella's still got her unused switchblade from the Iranian, so she stabs him eight times in an amusement arcade.
How anyone survived the water for over 10 minutes no one knows, but it is true that at least 6 person's were pulled alive and stayed alive, after this time though originally 150 were pulled out still alive but died and were buried at sea by the rescue ship Carparthia.
They also leave out all about the mens expedition except finding the miners body in the mine in northern Russia, and don't mention that his widow who was a lot younger than himself in 1912 is still alive in 1987 now aged 93 and gives an interview to one of the important people.
I know that these parents can act pretty badly, push their children too hard, and just generally act like a bunch of jerks, but it still raises the question of whether it is right to dupe people in top something they are not aware of - especially something that they will be judged the rest of their lives for by millions of people.
I was excited to re-watch it on Reel 13 because I felt that now, as a more educated and hopefully more sophisticated viewer, I could fully appreciate it for the important work of art that it was supposed to be, butÂno Â it's still pretty boring.
Luxo Jr. is a wonderful example of why people still prefer cartoons from 50 and 60 years ago to today's material.
ISLAND OF THE ALIVE is a very entertaining bad taste horror comedy , maybe not a classic like Peter Jackson`s BAD TASTE but still fairly good as the film opens with a woman giving birth in a New York taxi cab and a cop trying to shoot the new born baby , while the next scene features the knowingly stupid line " It took four bullets before it died - That`s some baby " , and of course there`s scenes of the mutant killer babies ( Done by stop frame animation , none of this CGI rubbish )going on killing sprees , and I haven`t even mentioned Michael Moriarty doing a great Al Bundy impression .
Worse still, I got this impression the film makers were vastly overestimating the importance of this movie in their own minds.
The ending you could tell the way it would end but it still had some holes.
I would never recommend this movie to anyone unless you have to watch and even then I am still sorry for you.
I don't have cable and I haven't seen a movie in a long time, but I can still recognize a poor movie and that was a prime example of a poor movie.
Sure you still want to see it ?
The first and third stories are a little cliched, especially the elevator sequence, but they're still quite great.
And after you've been robbed, car chased and after your dad's car ends up in a lake, there is still a good chance everything will be fine, with no serious consequences!
He was still cute back then.
This movie was Tom Cruise's claim to fame, probably still is.  
He lucky he only get house ripped off, he still have his privates!
It was better, but it still wasn't as good as a Hollywood remake could do.
Here's a director with a huge potential, a cinematographer who'll soon be one of the greatest, but they still have a long way to go.
PLEASE I saw the movie for free at a screening and still want a refund!
Later still, she arrives at Randolph Scott's cave soaking wet from a rainstorm and straight away passes out.
When the shuttle attempts an RTL (Return to Launch) abort, they do a nose over, a half a barrel roll and then attempt a turn to starboard....uh, with the external fuel tank still attached and the main engines firing.
First off, the cast has the same racial make up as USA for Africa with a Latino girl hanging out with an Asian girl, a black girl, and what I originally thought was some lost member of the Russian Aristocricy but ended up being poor even though she had a huge house and her introduction to the movie dealt w/ her enormous shoe collection: funny, a movie that tries to break down walls still has plenty of stereotypes.
There is a sequence where the movie fast-forwards by two-years and this girl is still the president of the student body and running the school like the Gestapo.
And now I'm still trying to wash the nasty taste out of my mouth.
I can honestly say that, my brain is still in the process of recovering.
Bratz was on the bottom 100 when it was on the cinemas but still has a very low rating, which is fair enough.
For me it's still a very negative word meaning that your parents have spoiled you.
One of my friends became very still, and started attracting flies halfway through the film, and another one became temporarily quadriplegic from watching this!
Unfortunately, this movie is live action (but still concentrates on the whole "appearance is the most important" thing).
Friends, the combined talent of the entire cast and crew of "Bratz" could be put in a thimble and there would still be room for Rosie O'Donnell's butt.
There are a lot of his movies I still haven't seen, but currently this one ranks lowest on the list.
You're gonna be red as a lobster, there's going to be white residue around your lips... the fact that the movie depicted the young adults as merely whimpering for water after days and days of no shade or drink is highly unrealistic, and even still they would've been in worse mental states and other bad physical conditions.
I haven't met a musical that I couldn't find something to like about it, so although the story is somewhat bland one can still enjoy the good highlights.
And the SPCA/HS still put them down... this movie is total, twisted garbage.
Good grief, we are still trumpeting the old canard of the Treaty of Versailles being the cause of the Second World War - read Margaret MacMillan's "Paris 1919."
Frequently despairing of ever being listened too, we see Winston go into times of deep depression overwhelmed by the feeling of powerlessness in a nation whose memories of WWI still horrify the populace into desiring peace at nearly any cost.
Absorbing and insightful, I wasn?t bored for a minute watching the story of this great man?s beginnings and the great woman who bore with him and supported him through all the frustration and aggravation of trying to turn around a nation still grieving the horrendous losses of the previous war.
), she still has sex with him.
I still feel soiled.
the only person in this film that still should have some dignity left is the chef guy who claimed all black people are addicted to ranch dressing, that scene was not bad.
"Chopping Mall" is by far better than most movies he's made, though it still isn't great.
The overly familiar "Friday The 13TH"-type premise (with an extra Sci-Fi note thrown in) is better executed here, but the movie still amounts to a complete waste of time after it's over.
I left the cinema very happy and with a feeling of a still lingering fear and intense joy that perhaps could come close to what you feel, still running but just having escaped unharmed after three hours of torture by a sadistic lunatic.
Sir Clifford's own inner anger comes through quite well, knowing that he can't perform for his wife in the way she'd like, but still refusing to let her go completely.
The plane had clipped pine trees as it came down and there were still pine needles stuck in the prop.
Oh, I'm still commenting.
Any real help comes too late and still no one is confronting the real issue that Laura is insane, not depressed, insane.
But even upon re-reading the novel she still had the same feelings.
Steve Burns does the best of anyone in the cast with what he was given, but is still not enough to make this entertaining.
A lesson we still revisit now!
DR. GIGGLES is actually so busy and cluttered that it's story becomes overwhelmed in a cacophony of arty camera angles, dark cartoonish neon lighting, plot twists, secondary characters, background development sketches, musical segues, billowing clouds of steam, leering closeup faces, hysterical supporting players, over-choreographed shock sequences, jam-packed picture frames that never sit still, excessive cutting for continuity, obscure character motivations, disposable unuseful dialog, people banging doors & breaking glass, and a self-conscious ongoing effort to never allow Attention Deficit Disorder plagued viewers from ever getting bored.
Though this entry still keeps the levels of visual style and production quality very high, the writing and characterization are so shallow and bland, it was pitiful.
The main character (the still stunning and drop-dead gorgeous Brian Benben) comments- "retarded."
He was still fixated on sharks a couple of years later when he made THE LAST SHARK (1981), a film which was partly shot in Malta and featured such second-tier American actors as James Franciscus and Vic Morrow.
Anyone who tries to make a movie for little or no money deserves a little credit, but at the end of the day, I still expect to see an enjoyable film.
I'm still recovering.
Oh, nope, they already did that...  anyhow... see this film... you'll still have a laugh or 20.
The vampires at the end where not only completely lame, but also ancient beings still dress in long flowing capes.
(and what was with him still living with his girl's parents?
When the director wants to make the action scenes 'dramatic', he thinks he can fool the audience by filming everything in slow-motion, while adding an 'echo' to nearly every word spoken in the dialogue - it just boggles my mind as to why amateurish garbage such as this still gets financed in today's economy.
I have always enjoyed the twist associated with 'good vampires' and I guess I am still waiting for a film to properly use it.
The script and the acting were pretty deplorable and the direction was anything but tight, though still one can sort of envisage what was intended; and those stolen fleeting glimpses serve to supply enough motive to keep watching.
British authors used to do something in this style (sometimes even in darker mood like Loach), American kids are too infantile (but still beat adults...), Italians are too mature (because of social context), Czechs forgot that they have children (and were among the best in 70's), so only French authors can stand next to Scandinavians.
But in the same time he can still feel joy in small things and in spite of accelerated maturation he keeps the soul of child and his real age comes to surface whenever allowed by the circumstances.
Neither of it should give second thoughts to any of those who believe that kids are still kids, despite what modern society tries to make them to be or make us believe they are.
I still lament the death of this fine young actor.
And throughout, Poirot subverts his beloved character with hyper-emotional exposition (for no good reason, given his lack of connection to the characters), a hitherto unrevealed religiosity, and a penchant for using 50-cent words that he's never before used, while still forgetting the English words for "thank you" and "yes".
There have been persistent rumors that Rosaleen's first husband, an intrepid explorer, is still alive and as such would nullify her marriage to Gordon.
I would still like to compare the film with the original book as I often find that by their very nature books deal with thoughts and feelings in more depth.
And return they do, and when they see their leader dead on the ground and the girl still in the cage, they start shooting at her.
Ruggero Deodato, of Cannibal Holocaust fame, directed the fairly enjoyable Cut and Run, an adventure movie with a little gut munching to spice up events, and Mario Gariazzo presented Amazonia, an unexceptional tale (actually about headhunters) that still managed to successfully capture some of that savage vibe that we cannibal fans know and love.
Group of strangers including a handsome, wisecracking paleontologist, a professor and his hot daughter, a grizzled Vietnam vet and his alky, unsatisfied wife, two nude models and their photographer are on a plane which crashes in the 'Valley of the Dinosaurs', where headhunting and cannibalism is still practiced by the resident tribe!!
But still, there are some good laughs if you're not expecting an intelligent movie.
Well, OK, actually it sucks, but you know you still have to have it- if you can get it!
It's too bad MST3K is not still around.
He still has on his suit with jacket, tie and tightly buttoned collar.

People who still retain all their faculties will likely find it a hoot from start to finish.
The street fires are ridiculous... supposedly it has been years.. but there's still refuse fires burning.
Some movies may be bad and still have good scenes in them and sometimes one of these scenes may acctually make the whole movie better but here thoose scenes are abscent.
Well Van Damme's acting is robotic, but he still gets to kick butt in human form as he goes after a cyborg woman carrying vital information that could cure the plague that affects civilization in the 21st century.
The whole ordeal opens with Jemma getting Pete, Mark, and Fred to come down to the Amazon, because she has a good hunch that some Professor Korenz, who was believed dead, is still alive.
Even if Climati was trying to take a jab at Deodato and his genre, he could have still done it by making a better movie.
The acting and plot get lame sometimes, but it is still fun.
Even though his life is on the line in every adventure, he still makes it very entertaining and sometimes adds a little humor into it to.
However, a problem would be that at least half way through the flick, we still don't know where they've come from.
It's still on here at my house, it is near the end, and I could care less about how it ends.
Now thinking about it I still can't.
At one point, towards the end, the black thug kid shows up for the ball room dancing competition still in his thug clothes, and he decided he must dance with the girl who's brother shot his brother, but they have since resolved their differences through dance, so Antonio takes off his jacket and gives it to him.

I admit I still watch portions from time to time and can actually feel my IQ lower while doing so.
I just can't understand why this garbage is still on television.
It's still on though even though during a recent live Halloween investigation it became clear that head investigator Grant was guilty of trying to pass off a fake voice and on the same show tried making it seem like his jacket was pulled on by a ghost, when it was clear he was doing it himself by something rigged in his pocket.
Will I still be entertained by other entertainment containing these elements?
How and why it's situated in the present, and even more so, that its story got through the datedness that bogs it down is a mystery, but then again, Latin America is still in a mire of its own ultra-conservative values -- men are supposed to be macho; women who take charge of their own life are seen as little more than "zorras" in heat, and everything happens in a very hush-hush way.
We never find out their mechanics, but it's still a pretty funny story.
Gonzalo- is a stud, is very selfish, was molested by his brother (and is still haunted by it), likes to paint phallic symbols, doesn't want to work in the rumored factory, doesn't want to get married but does want lots of sex.
It's still a very interesting movie though, I'd rate it a lot higher then this if dialogues and acting was better.
Even if you do not enjoy violence there are still many problems with this title.
The film is astonishingly wrong headed  This movie is different to the others, it has a different message, but its still the worst of the series.
We don't know who's who on the first viewing but still, what a boring a lazy way to start a horror film.
If this show wanted to be realistic, at least SOME of the characters WOULD be good people (Who can still make the odd mistake).
As long as you try to not yell at the shaky camera you can still watch this.
I still can't believe they managed to cram 48000 people, a cat and a dog into that tiny fleet.
I am the great fan of the old Galactica so maybe this makes me too critical, but still I think that the new one deserves only 1 star ( I would give it 0 if I could).
But I still watch.
But I still watch, and for the most part, enjoy.
He's still got that wry smile on when he faces down old friend Paden at the end.
It was considerably short of that, and one is left to wonder why this re-make was ever produced, and with all due respect to Geraldine McEwan, magnificent actress though she is, the late Joan Hickson still reigns supreme as Jane Marple.
Firstly, she has none of the subtlety that both the Miss Marple in the books and Hickson's portrayal still enduringly have.
The 1986 version went at a much faster pace, which gave an exciting and sinister edge to it, and didn't use half of the sub-plots used here, yet still managed to get a good hour and a half slot.
Plot concerns an emotionally fragile woman, still grieving over the choking death of her young daughter, sensing the spirit of a child around her, which may be causing death to her acquaintances.

I can see why VH1 would want a happy ending, but I still felt it chopped the story off too quickly and differently than real life.
My cousin still complains about it today.
As a matter of fact it was better that the book despite the fact that I still thought it was awful.
Knowing that thugs are after him, Tom still walks to work alone along miles of desolate country roads.
In summary, from the moment Viggo's family crowded around the little girl because she had a nightmare and all were there to console her (in Cronenberg's hackneyed attempt to show Tom Stall's initially perfect existence) to the end when Tom/Joey/Michael Myers comes home to find his family tensely sitting at the dinner table and little girl Sarah pulls out a plate to show daddy Tom/Joey/Jason X is still part of the family, the movie was a complete package of one terribly directed clichÃ© after another.
Flying hatchets were never that scary to begin with, and WITCHTRAP proves that they still aren't.
The result is mildly disappointing but might still be worth it for some.
Each time I'm hoping that the torture is over, but no, it still goes on.
I'm still amazed at how much of it was based solely on building a sense of ever-increasing dread without so much as seeing a single limb hacked off and barely any blood at all!
Director Mike Flanagan reinforces the theory that still stands the test of time: it's not what you can see that really scares you, but what you CAN'T.
OK in this case it is not taken too far but it still feels false and as though it has been added in just to keep the lady's in the audience happy (or rather the Hollywood executive's idea of what will make lady's in the audience happy).
I'm smarter than the average Joe; I can't believe people still fall for the 'oh my goodness, the bad guy is actually the person who appears to be the victim, the good guy!!'
One might be tempted to look at the failure of the family business or his parents' divorce as a catalyst, but still we are given absolutely no insight into the character.
Any fright film fan will be thrilled to see that there are still truly gifted film makers out there who can scare the Hell out of you.
Yes, in 2005 we're still trying to gett mileage out of that one and the perpetuation of gay stereotypes.
I'm very lenient with a movie that tries for something but falls short, but this one doesn't try for that much, and still doesn't achieve it.
Sadly, I can't resist pointing out that, with the mainstream cinema and media still completely allergic to even most innocently presented displays of same-sex affection, not to mention actual sex, films like this still do have a function to fulfill, even when they fail to live up to its audience's expectations.
2) After the horrible things Gwen has to say about Kyle at the end, Caleb (who earlier professed how much he cares for Kyle) doesn't even bat an eye and still wants to be with Gwen.
Despite this misstep, Jeff Bridges is still one of my favorites.
When Masturbating Woman awakens from her drug-induced slumber, her vision is obscured by gauze filters over the camera lens, but she can still distinguish the Mistress, Stern-Looking Woman and Wimpish Man, all of whom are now donning various S&M costumes.
Fortunately, 20 odd years later, we're still waiting.
The last half hour of this extremely overlong (120minutes) exploitation ordeal is literally disgusting and actually discouraging for those who were still expecting a happy ending.
And of course it starred Carroll Baker, still a knockout at 47, even without a hint of makeup.
The plot seems all too easy and done plenty of times before, but it still somewhat keeps your interest.
Obvious why it's a DVD feature, but still have to give credit to Johnathon Schaech for his drive and determination to adapt this screenplay and get it made.
Secondly, there are hundreds of dead mutilated, mostly real animals throughout the entire film making it one to watch on an empty stomach (I actually do biomedical research using rats, which I have to dissect biweekly for brain and spinal tissue, and the animal carnage still gave me a foul taste in my mouth).
The boy gets kicked out of private school, ends up in public school, but still wears the blazer with the private school emblem on it.

I am still trying to wrap my brain around the awards this film has won.
Trying to escape the country, Indy must outrun the Austrian secret police, led by the sinister Prussian (Joss Ackland in a wordless but still effective role).
I am not talking about just story here, because you can have a bad story but still keep people guessing for more.
Even the best reviews on this site mention the bad acting and the (obvious) low budget, but try to say that those aspects of the film are simply something a "low budget" or "indie" film maker must deal with and the writer/director/actor should be commended for dealing with such shortcomings and still finishing the production.
No, on second thought, even if those two conditions are met, there are still better things to do.
As does the comparison (generally unflattering, but still...) with Star Wars.
Audiences still don't know when they're being narratively cheated, or when a slightly promising idea has gone off the rails, or become a bloated, maddening mess.
Comparisons with Altman's McCabe and Mrs. Miller are interesting but mostly serve to demonstrate that this is (sorry but it is the best description) still pretentious drivel.
She has a lot of talent, but I still don't understand what drove her to make this movie.
The film does have some good moments, but I still think that they should've made it a whole lot better, which I know they could've.
This two-hour snooze-fest could have been EASILY cut down to half that length - and it would still not be fascinating.
This version of the film, which gets about everything from the novel wrong in spite of a competent cast and some good location shots, is one that all of its participants -- all who are still living, that is -- seem never to mention.
Long lost in a prolonged rights battle and unseen for years, Dario Argento's Four Flies On Grey Velvet may come from his most consistently inspired period but it's still such thin and often tedious stuff you'd half suspect he was keeping it hidden himself out of embarrassment until you realise that he's happy enough for the far worse Phantom of the Opera and The Card Player to still be out there.
Though the elements are glaringly contrived, the film still manages to generally pull them all together into an adequate whole, and there are some good comic moments and decent performances.
There were so many things TO laugh at: the plot was completely lame, the dialogue unrealistic, the acting terrible, yet I still think that for as bad as it was, it should have been funnier.

Nick Broomfield found some footage of the two stars past, but there is still the questions of who really committed the two murders, and were they connected?

LL Cool just looks at everyone, his face screaming "look, I can act like an alcoholic" but it still doesn't work.
Even if this was aired somewhere else, this would still be a pretty mediocre show.
At least Nick is still smart enough to know when they need to cancel shows.
I was the principal cinematographer* on EVIL'S CITY ( credit omitted from the film at my insistence for countless reasons although it still shows up on IMDb.com ).
Numerous people involved brought talent, experience, heart, energy and hope to the project, most without benefit of paycheck, but ultimately if a pilot flies a plane straight into a cliff, everyone still dies.
Everyone involved should best leave it off their resume and I am still angry for wasting the time and cash to see it.
Focus on the direction and characters, no matter the power of the story, and still something will stick to the audience.
I think it was "wild things" that had like a pretty poor double twist and I still liked the film because the rest was OK and it wasn't trying too hard to be a big twist.
It had everything a great movie should have except for an original story, being adapted from a novel it was still damn good.
I was even more angry I lost valuable minutes of my life sitting still to watch this.
But still I think it wasn't good, this movie wasn't good at all.
Just watch Cruel Intentions, whilst not a classic, still is a decent film and treats the subject matter well.
Westerns from the 30's and '40's were still much different than the later spaghetti-westerns.
But yet he's above all of course still an hero in this movie, who does everything right, everyone respects and admire and whose clothes never get dirty.
Now this does have a very well known cast of 1983 & still are known today.
For a bit of nostalgia or else those still desperate for a fix of anything ninja related the series is probably worth a look as long as you don't set your expectations too high.
But I don't care, I still love Helge Schneider!!
Nevertheless the music being played at the movie is still of high quality as we are used to from Helge.
Yes the movie has modern production values but still it doesn't seem to look very good and could have been directed alot better.
Rather than compare apples and oranges, I simply recommend people forget this film, and search for the 1979 Public Television Production-the first film ever made by PBS, and still the most requested item ever for PBS.
If we forget his American adventure (Arizona Dream), the decay of his movies was apparent already when "Underground" came out, but it was still bearable.
"Black cat, white cat" was still watchable, though clearly worse than the rest.
We could have done without Olivia Newton John altogether and they needed to do more with Beau Bridges' handicap--I'll say nothing more about it so as not to spoil this for anybody who still wants to see this movie.
Save your time, watch an episode of "Sopranos" instead, or, better still, watch "Whole 9 Yards".
But he's still at heart an awful human being.
And this is still a boring movie.
Who's still a selfish, obnoxious, jerk stuck in an utterly boring movie.
The only reason that they are still together is because she is to stupid and naÃ¯ve to break up with him.
However, this spoof of the 2005 hit documentary on the lives of emperor penguins in their frigid habitat is still pretty lame, and it's probably a good thing it wasn't played in theatres, since that probably would have given it more undeserved attention.
The plot is miles better than Xtro 2 but this still only ranks it as an average one.
Not nearly as sheerly dreadful as "Canadian Bacon", but still a far cry from classics such as Uncle Buck, Plain, trains and Great Outdoors.
Part of the problem would undoubtedly be down to the awful subtitles on my DVD (it said they were English on the box, but I'm not so sure), but even if they had been perfect, I have no doubts that I still wouldn't have had a clue what was going on.
It looks like you should start being scared about what's going on, but you aren't... and after that plane scene the overlong style is still killing this movie more and more, slowly until its end.
Add to this the fact that 3), Eliot's face is still covered in blood from the previous night's attack when he walks into the choir room, and no one in the choir expresses the slightest alarm at this.
You can see it a hundred times and still be thrilled with how our intrepid heroes deal with their situation.
I mean, once they were 16 and the abuse was continuing, there was no excuse that they would still have no idea what was happening.
Another example (a large one at that) is that even though one person in the film claims he is haunted by what happened everyday and that he is against the church (due to a lawsuit he's filed about 18 years later), the Church is still a big part of his life.
I still find this movie to be dis-miss able.
However, Ezterhaus should still be taken to task for writing yet another movie about a wildly successful and sexually adventurous female psychologist/author that lives in San Francisco and is under investigation for murder.
The whole action stops, and still the music continues till the scene is changed??
So the overzealous policemen are killed, but the governor stays alive and well, and the main hero can do nothing to him... Great going, all for naught, evil still walks the Earth.
Together with the woman's husband being yet another killer, and her still being trapped in a very uncomfortable marital situation.
But they're usually still OK to watch.
It's very much a primitive sound-movie, in which the director is still working with silent movie techniques, although not in any sophisticated way.
It shows that even a superstar like Errol Flynn didn't hatch from the egg fully formed, and that however bad you are to start with, there's still hope ...
Even though the poker tournament itself is boring, this movie still could have been laugh out loud funny.
I don't want to summarize the plot for you, because I'm still not sure what that was.
I still cannot believe how horrible this movie was.
I'll leave you with a bit of the wit from this movie; while the scientists are taking miko's pulse with the x-ray machine, they still don't know whether he's an animal, mineral, or vegetable.
Chaplin was still in his apprenticeship at this point and had only recently started directing his films.
After all, I still remembered how excited the previous movie had left me and the sixth book is perhaps the best of the entire series.
Setting the house on fire with all the blood-traitors, mudbloods and chosen ones still in, no, that would simply have been too...
Then there's the acting which still needs improvement on the part of the younger actors, especially Ginny who's acting was completely wooden for most of the film.
But the essence should not still be missed.
The acting has improved dramatically, although there are still a few cringe-worthy moments.
However, it is still not worth going to see by any stretch of the imagination.
The book still has excitement throughout all of the story.
On the theater's exits most of the people was still wondering what was the Half-Blood Prince, why is that name, what is the story, and all that kind of stuff.
The second half of this episode is a genuinely frightening horror tale with no letup till the memorable ending, which leaves our heroes M & S still basically in the dark, only able to guess at what just happened.
However, I still had tickets to go see it this afternoon.
And I am still looking for the marsh that Sutherland was supposed to be warden of?
I think most of the 'Carry On" cast were still alive at the time & would have been a great help/support in bringing a giggle to this long slow movie.
I suspect that some scenes developing the relationship may have been cut; still, shame on Agutter, Caine, and every other Briton involved in this production.
The movie ends neither too soon, which would leave them still tacky when you got up to turn it off, nor does it run long enough to disqualify it as a good excuse to sit down and paint your nails and let them dry thoroughly before starting in on any other projects.
Again I hope whoever has to see me in this film will understand my horror that it still exists.
When the over-scaled conclusion finally arrives, somehow it manages to still be unsatisfying and trifling.
But still the plot manages to be structured like any decent police-investigation story.
But still, I've seen worse.
Not as bad as Diplomatic Siege, but still bad.
But, "Buyu," which was sent to me by a Turkish friend from Australia is indeed a reminder that bad- truly bad films can still be made in Turkey.
Jeremy Glazer and Chad Allen give fine performances as two men who have found their way to clean lifestyles but still need to be who they are and seek love with another human being.
And Helen Trent still hasn't found a husband.
Sadly that magic has faded, and boring realism and drama has taken the forefront in an attempt to reinvent Bond, though it may have been acceptable if the Bond was right and if the Bond spirit was still in tact.
But it's always been a clear and obvious fact that the Bond films have never had much in common with Flemming's novels except for the titles, yet it has still become one of the most beloved film franchises of all time; Obviously not beloved enough to stop them taking over forty years of tradition and mythology (the one liners, the gadgets, the over-the-top villains and their over-the-top deaths)and flushing it all down the friggin' toilet!
Some say that it is still a good action flick, but hey, which movie did those people watch?
So, in order to help those fans, that still want to see the movie, to save some money, I'll round up the story now:  Bond kills one guy in a loo, then kills another guy in an office.
The torture may have stopped for Bond, but increases for me: Bond finds comfort in the arms of his girlfriend Vesper (yes, girlfriend) who tells him, to rebuild his pride, that even if the only thing left from him was his little finger, she would still love him.
The scenes with Will Ferrell and Matt Lauer still make a good YouTube video, but the rest is difficult to recommend.
I hate this movie so much with love.I love French Stewart,but I hate him in this.This film makes no sense what so ever.How did claw get old when this film takes place 4 years later.Why didn't penny get older.Why does the town look different.Why is Gadget still stupid when his glitches are fix.Why ask why.This is stupid.Too many question,none of the answers.
Yes, I accept it was more faithful than the brilliant cartoon show, but I still think it was a very poor sequel.
Penny still doesn't have her book and Brain still isn't getting anyone out of trouble.
French Stewart should stop working while he still is remembered for his humorous work on "Third Rock from the Sun", while the rest of this cast shouldn't even bother with another feature.
now it would have been nice if the story writers would have been more considerate and had it like all the world ad been taken over and the US,UK and the USSR joined forces to eradicate and had you fighting in different country's it wouldn't be as insulting to any one would it   Summary: now you can either agree with me (i doubt it) or disagree but at least give it abit of thought before you agree or disagree I've made my review and i stick with it.... Good Graphic Good Gamplay just racist maybe without intent but it still is racist
(And still, Dieter sleeps with him, throwing caution to the wind Â sure he might have used a condom, but protection was never shown.)
I was a young teen when I saw this but was still on a high from "Star Wars".
Although some of the themes are still maintained much of the story has been decimated.
Although it would still be a terrible movie even if you have no idea what Death Note is.
But still I'll try.
But why sometimes L speaks Japanese to the boy and he still understands (?)
The world is still rotten after this movie.
Matsuyama tries his best, and his presentation of L still manages to be simultaneously super-cool and super-cute, but there's only so much he can do with the ill-conceived storyline and juvenile scripting.
I'll agree that the movie is indeed awful, but it nevertheless brought a nostalgic smile when I came across the title as I was looking up some information on Ian McShane now that I have caught up on all the Deadwood episodes but still find myself wanting to see more of him.
I guess I should really see it again to confirm that I still feel that way all these years later, but I'm not willing to go through that ordeal.
I know the first Vampires being set in New Mexico wasn't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be.
All of a sudden they find a wounded baby elephant and Angela bonds with it naming it Dandy, but there are still poachers around hunting for elephants.
Sometimes the budget is mot there but the story is still good and entertaining.
Not all the answers will be answered, but still most of the points it lost are due to the ending...
Blood, gore and nudity was tossed into the picture but it's still bad.
The Mark of Gideon is one of the subpar shows of season 3--not as horrendous as The Way to Eden--but still bad nevertheless.
Overall, Hodin, Odona, Kirk and Spock's performance elevate the show to a 4 out of 10 rating in my view--still a failure but not a total disaster.
But the movie still takes Euro-centricism to a disturbing level.
Children's movies seems to often struggle with this point - a movie aimed at children still needs to appeal to the adults who are taking those children to see it.
We have three broads arriving on a boat, still in the clothes they were apparently arrested in, tried in Court, and then literally, sent up the river in!
It's a shame that this is just another entry in an overpopulated genre too, as the film features a good cult cast - Rosalba Neri is one of my very favourite actresses, and the film also features the likes of Maria Schell and Maria Rohm, as well as the great Herbert Lom; but the cast considered, this is still a rubbish film and I wont be recommending it!
Simon is DEAD, and his conscious integrated Travati, Anna and the emergency room doctors into his illusion, in order to give cohesiveness to the illusion that he was still alive and experiencing "time travel."
But such movies like "Der Heisse Tod"/"99 Women" (1969) still stand here in the now historic landscape like monuments of an epoch when the level of the German film sank below zero.
"99 Women", at least the original non-hardcore version, got released during the earliest stage of "W.I.P" madness and thus Franco was still clearly 'exploring' how far he could go with inserting lesbian sleaze and brutal whippings.
Amick is still one of the most beautiful and sexy actresses around and one of the most underrated too.
Even though this one was an hour it still did not feel like it, this one isn't even as satisfying as Dead Zone or The Worlds Strongest go watch those instead.
Antonio Margheriti still is one of my favorite Italian directors (thanks to his 70's & 80's films), but the mix he presents us with "Alien From The Deep", he has done before and much better already.
I watched it at 1.5 speed and still the pain did not end quickly enough.
I still don't know; worse, I don't care.
People are left behind and they change vehicles but still catches another person.
For instance Dudikoff is crippled in the beginning of the film (My guess is that he broke his leg doing one of the stunts for the movie) and yet despite this he still manages to outdo his American Ninja styled heroic actions with plenty of gusto to spare.
Not recommended by me but I'm sure there are diehard fans out there who will still watch this show.
After all, she knows Samara has returned for them, yet when Aidan has a nightmare that he refuses to share with her, his temperature drops five degrees and he starts acting really weird, she still is entirely clueless to what's going on.
No one bothered to explain why she is still haunting people through videocassettes.
Sasquatch spent most of the 90s toiling away in such horrendously lame'n'tame children's movie bilge as "Little Bigfoot," "Bigfoot: The Unforgettable Encounter," and "Big and Hairy," which makes this regional redneck horror/action hybrid a definite anomaly, but still nothing to get all excited about.
John Schnider still cannot act unfortunately.
He understands that he has given a second chance, but someone still has to die, so he must choose between his life, Peter's or Clair's.
They rarely ever do anything to the engine so even though you have car that has a TV in every seat and a stereo system that could cause permanent hearing loss, you are still driving the same old car underneath.
I'd recommend this to anyone looking for something off the mainstream, but it should be taken with a "the film's what you make of it" approach towards the end to still be enjoyed.
These cartoons are mostly recommended for movie buffs who will still recognise the stars being parodied (here they include the Marx Brothers, Carmen Miranda, Ray Milland, Frank Sinatra and Humphrey Bogart) but 'Slick Hare' offers a chase between Bugs and Elmer for anyone not interested in celebrity spotting.
Maybe those who died gave up, and those who lived still had something important to live for.
Though the rating of a movie to simply overall 1 to 10 can be difficult, and I am still on the fence of how much I like it (having just seen it, and would like to come back to it a few weeks from now).
She's smartly dressed and coiffed but still has that matronly appearance that makes her unsuitable for what is supposed to be a light romantic comedy.
When a film that's had such a bad press as "Buffy" still manages to disappoint you, that's one bad film.
There is one fairly good action sequence at the halfway point as well as a neat stunt that sees him jumping down a building via the air conditioning units, but you definitely get the feeling that Chan's no longer pushing himself but is just doing what he knows he can still do while Yuen Biao is mostly wasted in a nothing bit part.
Like it sucked so bad I still can't believe it.
Her dyed blonde locks now toned down to a still teased, yet slightly more modest black.
No doubt she was cast because at the time she was still Hollywood's flavor-of-the-month, but we are asked to suspend disbelief and accept her not only as a New York police officer, but as one who would be selected to go undercover and infiltrate the Jewish community and live with them as one of their own.
"Kingdom of Heaven" still is winner in this genre.
"Xtro 2" had nothing to do with the original and is basically a derivative "Alien" movie, but was still reasonably fun for mindless entertainment.
As badly made those films were, they were still incredibly fun because of all the camp.
THE I INSIDE give more answers at the end than OLDBOY or MULHOLLAND DRIVE, but it is still a fascinating film.
All this might still be fun in an archeological kind of way, i.e., look what passed for social philosophy in the Sixties, if there were any energy in the directing, the writing, the music or, barring all that, in more than one or two of the main performances.
These young men (and a few female dates), although mostly conservative-minded, were still eager to absorb the mod culture of the times, and probably had enjoyed movies such as "Alfie".
I can still remember what those still left in the theater, towards the end, spontaneously and simultaneously yelled at the screen when Joanna said "I'll be back!"
Heather O'Rourke is still adorable as Carol Anne, Zelda Rubinstein, in a glorifified supporting role, stops by to help the Freelings the best she can(..having delved into the history of what took place in the cavernous dwelling under their house), and Sampson as the Indian shaman is a charming, welcome presence who wishes to bestow wisdom to the family often just confusing poor Steve whose life has fallen on hard times thanks to the spirits which won't leave Carol Anne alone.
All talk about how the family must stick together feels strange considering that one of the kids from the first film isn't in this one, and no explanation is given either (yes, I know the actress was killed shortly after the first one - but still...).
Though, it's not as engaging, it does lack the panache of the original and the special effects aren't as imaginative this time around, but still it's the film's strong point.
Although it's a well documented fact that the actress who played her, Dominique Dunne, was murdered shortly after the first film was released, I still don't think it would have trashed her memory to have explained her absence; quite the opposite in fact.
At the end of the scene, the characters are still in the some location, doing the same thing, and nothing new has been presented.
Even though its free, its still a waste of 50 minutes of your life, So save your bandwidth and avoid this fanfic.
If curiosity is still getting the better of you, watch the first 5 minutes and you'll know what I'm talking about.
Far from being a good movie, one should still consider this a good fan film and applaud all involved for their effort.
Perhaps more could have been accomplished but still it's a good ride.
In fact, it was so long ago that the main feature still included a B-movie companion.
If he were in light entertainment even today, this is still the stuff he would be producing.
Even though I disliked and heavily bashed a lot of the films he starred in, including this "The Werewolf and the Yeti", I was still a big fan of his work and charismatic appearance and I hope that he'll rest in peace in the hereafter.
Even if every word of dialogue were cut and the characters used sandwich boards--it still could not be done.
Twenty years later and still a lousy director, practice doesn't always makes perfect.
Nothing new, nothing special, average acting, typical H. B. Davenport' story, weak and cheesy FX's, bad ending of movie, but still the author idea is good.
The novel on which the film was based was a straight thriller and I think could have been played straight to better effect--and still could be.
"DIL chahta hae" still reminds me of inner me.
The Arachnids are still far more numerous than the humans, and is ever testing their defenses.
And I still managed to get disappointed.
It's obvious that there was a lower budget on this movie, what I like is that they worked on it and still made it watchable (only if it is average) even on such a budget.
I still remember that evening when I first borrowed "DIL CHAHATA HAI" CD secretly on the way back from mathematics coaching & very excited to watch it because my sister watched it two days ago & highly praised.
even the bug CGI is barely up to video game standards and not a patch on the original (which is 11 years old (1997) now and still looking much better than anything in ST3).
I still remember how impressed I was afterward.
However, this is still a bad TV movie.
Her husband (Mitchell Ryan) is dismayed that she still has not gone back to work or that she will not renew their mutual hobby, mountain climbing.
Meanwhile, aspiring ballet dancer, Diane (Jennifer Garner) still has to ask her parents for money to make ends meet, something no family member likes, including Diane.
I have since watch other films to see if DCH was a fluke but for me there still was that Bollywood magic.
"The Bostonians" still remains a politically offensive minor effort easily overlooked because it also commits the crime of being dull.
i gave it 45 minutes of my undivided attention and there was so little going on i realized that i could do at least 2 more things at once and still know exactly what was going on.
I know all of the above and it still made me feel sick.
You can take a pig, dress it up, put lipstick on it and call it Monica, but in the end it's still a pig.
Second season was very good, not as good as first one, but still kept the high level.
I put up with this insanity for about half of the show's duration, still enjoying the interplay of the actors, but the final straw came in season four, when Mr. Monk went to a rock concert (ho ho, he thinks it involves rocks) and mistook a port-a-john for a phone booth.
I don't have to have a totally action packed movie in order to enjoy it, but wow... this movie is a pretty honest account of something like what many people go through, but still... geez.
AND... there is the third type of people, who have no much wisdom, but still wanna show their "wisdom" to others, try to explain the world with their stupid way...
I was totally wrong, it's nothing, it gots no laughing( or got some cheap ones), no real actions, fake romance, and a lot of disgusting scenes(with only commercial purpose)... And, all of these are ok, i've seen too many movie got these elements, and i still enjoyed them.
(I never expect too much on movies, any kind of cheap movies, if it has any kind of spark, i will still watch it to the end).
Dil Chahta Hai was an amazing movie for me when I first saw it...and it's still one of my favorites.
Yet i still kept wanted to watch it.
Too much of flashback, some stupid scenes and they still have a lot of ammunition!
Chances are you will still be disappointed.
Throw in a typecast Pam Grier in leather as a lesbian prison guard (as if JACKIE BROWN never happened) and a mechanical Anthrax score, and you still havenÂ´t got the edge to help this turkey anywhere.
He burst onto the scene with Halloween, which was not only masterfully done, but spawned a whole genre of bad sequels that still plague us today.
He followed that up with a string of hits, including The Thing, which is still for my money one of the scariest movies ever made.
i am 13 and i watched Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century when i was like 9 and I still successfully HATED it.
If it isn't, and I hope to God it isn't, it's still painful to think about the puppy as it's held by its fur in the air whimpering for as long as it takes to shoot that gratuitous, 100% needless scene with all of these intimidating, cold humans going about their business not even thinking of tending to its pain and fright.
I am still waiting to see him portrayed well.
Leaving alone the fact that this woman looks exactly the same in and out of costume in front of the Martin guy, there's just the fact that when she's rejecting him, she's still wearing his earrings.
How ironic then that this all-talking backstager is spoiled by a camera that just won't sit still.
When the camera is still it is often at some daft high angle or pointing at the actors' legs, to no real advantage.
All these things were by then established cinematic conventions, and they still are, for good reason; they bring human interaction to life on the screen.
14 years later, I still don't.
This is what `Tepepa' was fighting against, but by the end of the movie with both Tepepa and the Orson Welles characters killed we're still not sure whether this country will be ruled by the people or by those who have the money.
Basically a one character script due to the fact that Randy (Michael Pitt) had very little dialog and most of the movies dialog was by Stephen Adly Guirgis (Jake) who gave a good performance but still was not enough to save this movie from being awful, all and all i didn't enjoy this movie to recommend to you, so the best i can say is in this one sided movie was lackluster and didn't have much to offer it's audience in the way it was written it had no surprises or Suspense and little if any drama, the only thing that made this movie anything was Stephen Adly Guirgis (Jake) who's acting ability kind of saved this movie from being a total disaster which is what it came close to being, he did give it some uplifting moments at times but other then that it wasn't worth seeing, so take your chances if you do decide to watch this movie as it really failed in the script and the ending.
Bob Mitchum is no Dick Powell in Fairwell my Lovely, or Ralph Meeker in Kiss Me Deadly; but he still manages to do a fairly good job.
After 70 minutes, there was still nothing, and I gave up.
We also get here another of Lillie's stage schticks: she is seen standing still on stage, wearing a formal gown that reaches to the floor, entirely concealing her feet.
After 12 episodes there was little threat from any aliens, and there was still no sign of them.
Those questions were discussed very seriously in the late 60's (and still are) because "2001" was a believable world where our powers of disbelief remained suspended for 2 1/2 hours.
And we still do.
The original "Xtro" (1983) still remains a cult favorite these days, because of the gory effects and weird nightmare sequences.
But, still for any viewers around the world this movie could set the lowest limit of how a movie could be made.
today when i woke up and found out he's still alive and in office, i had the shock of my life :-)   but honestly, this film was well meant and everything, but as always you get pointed in the wrong direction.
Just pitifully, we have lots and lots Hindi speaking people in town and they have been here for a very long time, still the local Chinese don't really care to know their culture, let alone watch good Indian movies.
Let's continue it  Bollywood is ushering itself into the world stage but it is still not a strong counterpart to Hollywood.
But it is just unbelievable that in this advanced western culture we still get garbage like this passed off as a work of art etc.
However this will remain to others, who have seen more than this movie and have a different understanding of this world in which we live in, an intellectual 'wheelchair' to the Liberal base that doesn't indeed look for the good in America but continues to find a 'Villain' in the U.S.   My question is, before 9/11, when there were still three thousand people in one piece, and Bin Laden was offered to President Clinton, on two different occasions, when William passed on taking him, because he said, "We have no business, with Bin Laden."
The too-close to reality of a story that never happened and the 'victim' ~ the President is still alive.
Dum duh dumb...dumb  I'm still stammering to figure out what the purpose was to even spend the time to write this story?
we couldn't understand how this even got air time, it has good actors but still you could see that they are ACTORS.
But it still retains the same passion and romanticism that has become a Bollywood staple ever since the beginning, thus making DCH a thousand times better than other "Hollywood-wannabees".
You'll be surprised at how much hope is still left in Bollywood.
But he still has not found that special girl.
Sonali Kulkarni is wasted and Dimple Kapadia still looks gorgeous and plays her role well.
a lot of questions which you will never get an answer to them it's really so bad but still the main idea of the movie is not so bad this haunted house and whoever connect with it is disappeared by somehow i think i like it maybe the language has it's effect my mother tongue is Arabic and as you know we all used to English but Japanaise is very unfamiliar .
I still wait for the definitive Sherlock Holmes which takes the original stories and makes them as exciting on screen as they are to read.
John Cusack has made a number movies that border on the strange, yet still work.
I am still asking myself why I continued with the DVD.
I am sure some will sing praises of this effort, but if a rose is still a rose by any other name so, too, is a messÂÂÂÂÂ  I now remember why I continued with the DVD.
First we have the three young men, who are borderline still boys, who are wearing suits and hats and driving one of the lad's father's black Cadillac, without permission.
Then when Florence finally shows up out at the fort where Leon is, Leon, who has already been blubbering, which seemed completely out of character for him, does still more bawling around, and Florence sort of comforts him in a rough kind of way.
High marks for this film since it beat the Bollywood standard of being completely incoherent and inane, although still sticking to the three plus hours.
It can be crude and offensive, as when Marsh jokes to Ross' question about why he is still single, "I'm a faggot.
Although i think Robert Patrick (agent Dogget) is quite good he is still no match for David Duchovny as an actor.
2 and 3 were OK, but still they still don't compare at all with the first.
(A CLASSIC)I think Kickboxer 4 just made Tong Po look so stupid and weak.In the original he lost to Van Damme but he still was a bad mofo.In 2 and 4 they made him like look an amateur.I know Van Damme ain't a great actor but his action scenes make up for that.Sasha Mitchell on the other hand is a terrible actor(acting scenes and fighting scenes)If your gonna make a sequel u better make it better then the first if not don't make it all.
They felt it was still a good movie despite being without Van Damme, well we fell this is a good one despite no Satcha Mitchell.
Other than that, I still shudder at the confusion I felt as the film prodded along (quite slowly).
But something just tells me that even then it would still suck.
Anyone who still believes this movie shames the original ... or that the series itself isn't worth seeing needs to have his or her brain removed ... because it's obviously not being used correctly.
By the way, another thing that really bothered me was that in Krrish, Rohit in the flashbacks while he was still young looked too much like the mentally handicapped Rohit from the first film.
At the end of the film I still cared more about the characters from the previous film than i did for this one.
Starting with a baffling opening - note that the poachers see strange lights while the asteroid/egg chamber is still in outer space - and ending on a depressing note (most of the interesting characters are dead and poor Trumpy will inevitably follow them), Pod People provides two hours of... well, pain.
Geez, just think about how good, exciting, thought provoking films like "Metropolis" get chopped up so badly to the point of scenes being lost forever, and then released, yet films like this are still released in their original form.
(I thought it would have been more realistic and still funny if the bandits were actually menacing.)
Even with the assistance of Joel and the bots, this is still a very painful viewing experience.
Second, Roz, while appearing somewhat matronly, still looked a little too young for the role.
Dr. Jim and Laura finally roll onto the shore, stand up without a broken bone or bruise, make-up still absolutely perfect.
What a bogus effect, especially since you can still see the guy's flame thrower in the background and the little tiny flame on the tip!!!
These types of movie are one of the reasons that the UK film industry is still flagging ('cough...nepotism...ahem).
My partner still hasn't forgiven me for taking him to this, do you know how many Arnie / Bruce / zombie films I had to (uncomplainingly) sit through as penance?
Tom goes back up to the Hollywood sign, where Redcoat's body is still in the car.
An example is the Oscar winning "Life Is Beautiful", which to me is still the best film of all time.
"Edges of the Lord" is still a big disappointment.
While, the make-up effects of the outer space visitor are questionable, it still manages to hold up for its tiny budget.
It may have traded in being left at home for the city of New York, but its still the same exact story as last time.
Its amazing they're still breathing, much less walking after the things they go through this time.
However there are still some drawbacks to this as in several scenes one can literally count the different parallax and compositing layers.
And yes, you can still identify CG even though the shaders are extremely good and I do not want to know how much post-processing they put over it.
His place has Japanese wicker furniture, a polished hardwood floor and yet he still mopes around in a funny hat just like in BUSTING looking all burnt out & washed up, which Elliot Gould is of course very good at.
Walter Hill has done some GREAT movies (HARD TIMES, his first, is still his best, THE DRIVER, 48 HRS, TRESPASS is pretty thrilling too), but this is among is weak works, unfortunately NICK NOLTE, whom I love to watch, does a hammy job (on purpose, probably), the whole movie is poorly photographed (it looks like "made for TV", but in fact I have seen better photographed "made for TV"-movies !
I still remember the trailer they used to promote this movie in Europe (it's a different trailer than the one here on the IMDb, which is a weak trailer, too) and it was in fact a TERRIFIC trailer, just great, with the soldiers being introduced in scenes I never saw in the movie (you never see the soldiers sparkling in Nolte's glasses in the movie either...), so I remember having felt let down when I saw it first (nearly 20 years ago), but recently I wondered if it's time for a new viewing, when it was aired on TV here a few days ago: well, as said above my memory was unfortunately right and it still has not improved with time (never will).
It's diverting fun but it lacks entirely any of the poetry that Sam Pekinpah might have brought to it while he was still functioning adequately.
However, for film nuts like myself, it's still worth seeing for all the strange and unexpected cameos, such as Henry Fonda and John Garfield (among others).
By the end of the movie I still had no clue what was going on.
I mean at first it was cool, then it become OK this is his thing, and now its just wow your still doing that.
While his fellow actors Shah Rukh Khan, Aamir Khan, Salman Khan, and Akshay Kumar and progressed he is still stuck in that some place.
They meet up with Kevin, and still having some left over bruises from last time, want to carve him into little pieces.
Some though they were copies of Hollywood movies but still worth a watch.
Sterling Holloway gets minimal mileage out of his home made still bit, and Wills is mildly entertaining with 'Sweet Bessie From Pike'.
So, all in all, let me summarize that I still feel this is a mainly uninteresting, dull, boring movie that has nothing new or really profound to tell, and that misuses the element of cancer (or any serious illness, for that matter) for its dramatic effect on the audience.
First of all, that accent is sexy, don't get me wrong, but are we really supposed to believe that a well-educated 24 year-old who's been in the U.S. since she was 11 still talks like that?
Or better still, kill them off in the first act, and put them out of their misery.
To me the movie gets still somewhat saved by the Roger Moore cameo.
Oh well, he probably was too expensive at the time to cast him for further Pink Panther, plus he of course at the time was still committed to playing James Bond, so no way they would had allowed him to play a different 'cop' in a different comedy movie series.
While this is not quite the train wreck that TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER was, it's still a pretty weak entry in the PANTHER series.
Still, surprisingly "Curse of the Pink Panther" isn't all that bad because I can still watch it without throwing up and I'm sure that's something everyone can't manage to do.
There's couple of good scenes here and there and I can still enjoy it because of the old team: David Niven, Robert Wagner, Herbert Lom, Joanna Lumley, Capucine, Burt Kwoak...they're all here to fill the enormous hole Sellers left behind.
Following the death of Peter Sellers, the Pink Panther series seemed to have little future but director Blake Edwards still managed to grind out two further entries.
Fonda appears bored, while still trying to appear smart and glamorous, in her role.
It could easily have been a radio play, still popular at the time (1951) or a live TV show from Playhouse 90.
FINAL CHAPTER holds several very good scenes that stand with the best of the series and does create an atmosphere that was notably missing from PART 3, but is still pretty bad.
I still wholeheartedly recommend PART 2 as the best of the series.
Since assumptive reviewers' good part favorably sees the past and as the past is "better" than the present they have given several credit to the preceding episodes being still the last episode more explosive and spectacular.
Better still, find some stills on the net and use those two hours of your life to do something interesting like cleaning the grout in your shower stall.
To this day, I still wonder what is he saying.
I still think so today.
even though they lack everything else, but it was still nicely done in animation wise.
George Lucas has fallen in love with computers and failed to notice that his digital animals don't move at all in the way that real animals move - worse still, they don't move like any kind of physical object at all.
I watched Phantom Menace last night and my thoughts are still the same.
It felt to me like the movie was still just beginning until half way through the final sequence -- nothing that felt like a plot had happened yet, so I had assumed that the real action was yet to begin.
I was still waiting for the story to get started when the final battle began.
Are you still with me, OK stay tuned it gets more and more hard to follow, the family also have a sister who was locked up in an asylum after she murdered her father, except she didn't, as the truth the doctors told them would be worse for her mental state.
Hello are you still there, for those who are I hope you're following it because I'm pretty lost.
Although the 2008 "Severin" Region 1 DVD release is bare-bones, it's still not worth buying.
If it had any semblance of success in the US, it was likely because people were still hyped by the previous film, and did not realize that American Adobo was produced by Philippine filmmakers.
While I don't mind any of that (and indeed was willing to watch this movie), still, I found the characters to be weak and mostly fall into type.
I'm watching this movie while I write this and still can't believe this wasn't filmed in jest.
While no longer a lawyer, Russell still gets to keep his integrity as he does charter fishing down in Florida.
His Aunt Georgette from the first movie is still in Paris so he uses her half-renovated home as a huge mousetrap for the bungling burglars.
I went into this expecting to see a fun, mindless action movie... maybe a little bit campy or predictable, but still entertaining.
It still has me constantly laughing 'till this day, I think if you loved the first Home Alone, I'm sure that you'll just naturally love this one as well.
Bela is healthy and strong and powerful and I daresay still sexy here -- why was he being wasted?
For anyone else, it's still a pretty good dark comedy of its time.
The plot is full of holes and unexplained people and circumstances--I'm still not sure what Rossitto is doing in this.
But the film still comes across as one of those throw-aways that were on the lower half of the double bill at the local Bijou.
Of course, if the film worked even on that level, it might still be entertaining: a latter-day Captain Blood swashbuckler, perhaps.
The historical backdrop might still be of some interest, but that too has been horribly botched.
While a case may possibly be made for leaving that out, less understandable is the fact that, although the film covers the team's career in radio and movies, for some unfathomable reason it completely ignores the fact that they had a hugely successful television series for several years (which is still being shown in reruns today).
I think that in this day and age it is very sad that for whatever reason women are still being perceived in such light on screen.
Since then I have seen this movie several times, and still find it uproariously funny.
Gotta tell ya, folks...i was really pulling for Brad Garrett, but this show has "mid-season cancellation" tattooed all over it...Garrett is one of those guys who's funny standing still, but even he's not going to be able to dig his way out of this level of sub-standard writing...the whole premise is DOA...Fox broke some ground with "Married With Children", but this reconstituted substitute of a remake is 20 years late and as tasty as margarine....  As Elaine Benes herself might have said, "Next!!!
What is weird is that while the show has obviously turned in to a train wreck, it is still on even though you can tell no one cares anymore... Their daughter has been replaced twice, even going from a brune girl to a blonde girl between 2 episodes, but if you can't tell that it's a sign even the producers don't care anymore then keep watching by all means!
But still did not understand anything the movie tries to tell us.
So yeah, there are artistic ways of showing nudity and some scripts need it, but this movie didn't need any, it had an interesting plot itself, but it didn't move an inch from the synopsis, nothing interesting ever happened in the film and even after the rushed and ridiculous ending, I was still waiting for something, ANYTHING, to make my time spent on the theater worth it.
Last time we checked, there are still a few directors honest to their trade who do not copy so brazenly.
Nope, still no good.
Well, the single merit of this thing is that it has more scenes of people lying on beds than a porn movie (but in this case, they are not doing anything, just thereÂ and still thereÂ.
Despite the above listed complains, I think Martel is talented but may be she still has to find her own voice.
The only thing that was great was the stunt driving, but I'm probably one of the three people who still go to movies who doesn't go to the movies for that.
Puffinstuff and I still would say it's more like Puffinstuff, in the sense that it makes no sense.
The idea of having radio/TV stations still running while earth is being taken over clearly influenced Romero in Dawn of the Dead.
The second time I watched the show was again out of disbelief because I still thought it was an animated short whipped up by the network during a commercial break.
sketch comedy (Robot Chicken again), though I'm still sometimes at a loss as to whether I want to laugh of just smack them.
Would love to know if the original theatrical version still exists somewhere.
Or *is* horrible, I should say, as I'm sure it is still playing at a theatre near you.
Albeit marginally, but it still does.
Julie doesn't have an independent thought of her own (which she admits within the text of the play) but she still regurgitates what she has been taught with extreme deliberate passion, for an attempt at control and to create a notion that she is far more intelligent than she is.
I doubt that anyone still takes this movie seriously these days but it's funny seeing how people went paranoid about pot in the 30's.
However, when you decide to watch it up against the original you realize it is still a weak movie.
The pacing is better and the characters, while still a bit stiff, more relatable.
I especially was opening my own wrists in the Arena shootout scene, looking at the princess just standing still and shooting around, without a hint of any kind of battle tactics or trying to take cover.
Now, dont get me wrong, there were still some good things about this flick.
It's evidently cheaply made and pretty bad overall but, I guess, harmless enough; still, virtually the only thing of interest here is the film's comic-strip look, complete with captioned descriptions during transitions.
Watching this disaster, I think I must've said "I can't believe that I'm still watching this" about fifty times.
Watching this disaster, I think I must've said "I can't believe that I'm still watching this" about fifty times.
!If those of you, who's still having life pumping through your veins,are going to watch this worthless pile of crap, be prepared for a couple of scenes in particular that is probably some of the greatest comedy ever put on screen; the scene with "evil" genius getting angry at woman for having a dog, the scene in which "evil" genius and woman is attending a concert together, and right after, the scene in the carriage.
Then, if things couldn't get worse, the crooks take over the cop car with George and Gwen still inside and then decide to dump them in the middle of Central Park.
In the early 1970's, veteran stars (Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, Kate Hepburn, Olivia DeHavilland, Joan Bennett, and Bette) were all working; Hepburn and Stanwyck pretty much remained unscathed, while Bennett's "Dark Shadows" was still a hit no matter what the critics thought.
And I'm still in dark why the director chose an old-man figure as the killing cyborg.
If you still want to rent this you can watch the documentary on the DVD where you will meet the director Rosa van Praunheim who will tell you how famous, wise, and intellectually and sexually experienced he is.
Many early sound films suffer from varying sound or sound that is simply too soft, as they had still to work out all the ins and outs of the new medium.
I still don't know how this pair landed in the zoo.
Not one joke in the film worked, and even if it was a mediocre one (which is the best they had), it still was terrible because of Matthew Perry's awful timing and the overall bad acting.
Lemmon's shear repetition of wanting to get everyone's phone number and address is hysterical, because through his fatigue in trying to cope with one problem after another in The Big Apple, he still finds the strength to take down everyone's name and number, and promises to retaliate at a later point in time.
Dectective Lucas McCarthy (Lance Henriksen) is still haunted by the night he captured the notorious serial killer Max Jenke (Brion James) who has murdered over 110 people, most of them with a meat cleaver.
I'm still "rewarding" this film with a generous 3 out of 10 rating, only because the murder sequences are ingenious and remotely gory.
I went into the movie with rather low expectations, but still i came out totally disappointed.
Having read the books, I knew roughly how they ended up in the places that they did, but I still felt a little in the dark about it all.
He could make a two-hour film from a story that could have been told in fifteen minutes, full of dead ends, boring, irrelevant fluff to make up the time, dull action scenes and shameless pretentiousness, and yet still the public lavishes him with unconditional love.
Ray Manzarek is a legend of the keyboards and has a Masters degree in film from UCLA but its interesting to note that he is still more famous for Light My Fire than Love Her Madly.....
The outsider in every one of the movies is lame, nothing like the book (and I know, if they tried to make it like the book says they would have to spend a lot of money and it still wouldn't be up to par to Koontz's imagination) but at least make him like the 3rd movie, more reptilian looking with big claws (that don't dangle!).
Maybe, but for what it's worth, it's still better than Friends.
Now some observations on the performances of the principles:  Julia Ormond: At least in those days they were still actually casting British born actresses to play British characters, sparing us from having to spend two hours listening to the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow or Texan Renee Zellweger blather on in their phony English accents.
You could have put Richard Petty next to Julia Roberts in that puff fest and still made mega box office).
Their idea of sword-fighting is two people standing still and swatting each others swords.
For those two points alone I've given it an extra star, but it's still an awful movie.
If it would have been a pure fantasy-movie with no connection to reality it would be still a bad movie but perhaps not that bad.
lets just say I was so disappointed its unreal, OK i knew it wouldn't be an Oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun no-brain film in the bloodsport mold.
The film was still watchable, and while it's not one of the better films I'll be seeing this year, it has some redeeming qualities.
I still can't believe I watched the whole thing.
But it's still more than worth watching.
However, even with the little propaganda and Holly Hunter's inclusion in the film, I still recommend this film.  
I still don't understand why the mother does not like the wife.
I guess we are to assume she "wised up" during her 3 years in the Big House and Joe, still full of admiration for Mary for her virginity as well as her smarts, willingly lets her start calling the shots.
She's still a frigid little virgin, as he suddenly realizes when he tries to kiss her (just as Joe had earlier in the movie).
Mary is still crying, but clearly relieved.
And that would still be more than they spent on the original.. 2/10
Even the first two are not as sick as they could have been, but they are still very rough and mean spirited.
I found it interesting to see that all the procedures and conventions had already evolved into much the same form that is still used today.
I kept up with it because I'm a Star Trek fan (features, of course, Bill Shatner and a short appearance by Walter Koenig), and still want to like Columbo, but with this, I'm not sure anymore.
One can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it's obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and whimpers to an end without making much of a statement.
How many thousands of live hours will be still stolen to another thousands of innocent spectators.
I still can't believe the respect some people have given this picture.
It's it jumped from another area to the area with no detail explanation on the drugs other than the ending which is probably my favorite part but still that is not enough.
The settings were beautiful, but every internal scene seemed to have been filmed in semi-darkness.At least the actors didn't fall into that awful American habit of inserting what sounds like 'full stop' every 3 or 3 words, but dialogue was still slurred and on occasions difficult to discern.
FoxxÂ errÂ I still cant get past his Living Color days to take him seriously.
Bob swore live on air in 1985 but he organised the life saving world changing concert so he can get away with it , but here we saw Green Day swear in a pre recorded piece from Berlin while Hyde Park heard the F word come from Velvet Revolver ( I've still no idea who they are ) while Snoop Dogg continually ranted on about a " mother figure " or something .
Live Aid raised money via the Â£20 ticket for the concert , and the pledges , tens of millions were raised but the concert goers for Live 8 attended via a text messaging system and this means the world wide concerts were effectively free , no money was raised for NGOs and the general public who unfortunately are ignorant on African affairs went home still ignorant on African affairs .
I do probably more than most, but I still don't really know why the hell Africa is such bad shape.
It could have had nothing to do with Africa, it could have been to celebrate sponges and people still would have shown up.
Let's start with the premise: a girl (freedom fighter/terrorist) becomes impregnated by a wounded "brother in arms" while they find themselves hiding from the government troops in a ditch (and the latter are still raiding the area, might I add).
Some I wish I still knew.
You still get to see Jim Carrey do his quirky and funny impressions, so that's a plus.
I'm surprised they got away with this since the Hays Code was still very much in effect in 1952.
Now conceive of a "plot" written by selecting random snippets from twenty seconds of Gumby dialog (a la Monty Python), and you'd still be imagining a less torturous movie than ROTOR.
I'm still trying to figure out how to collect compensation from the production company for the hour of my life they wasted... and concurrently how to involve them in some appropriate form of torture.
); and the technological advancements still haven't gone beyond 5 1/4" floppies.
Bottom of the barrel is still too high to reach for "R.O.T.O.R."
Surprisingly ROTOR didn't sweep the Oscars that year but i'm still at a loss at why this camp classic has yet to get a DVD released.
At some point, still early during the production, I presume the cast & crew realized R.O.T.O.R was going to become a gigantic failure and so they started adding ridicule self-parody and even hugely irritating jokes about everything resembling a "Bad B-Movie".
The film still wants to try and be some kind of a western at the same time!
It's a slow moving story with a very very bad contents - unbelievable that such poor scripts still are made.
I simply can not believable that such bad movie still are produced.
I still remember "Underworld"...Pant's more like, but I digress...
Until one day, officer Shade survives a mysterious incident in a freezer (I still haven't figured out what exactly happened there) and all of a sudden he enjoys monstrous powers.
And then still this movie fails to impress because of its many boring sequences and the completely illogical structure featuring at times.
Worse still, in addition to all these problems, all the gloom and mayhem is seemingly endless!
The portrayal of the teenage boy and his struggle was believable, but I'm only 25, so I still remember quite well what it was like to be a teenager.
I watched quite a while back, so can't really comment on the editing, etc - but the bitter after-taste still lingers and when I came across it here on IMDb, had to vent some latent frustration that had been pent up.
That being said, i know many will feel entitled to tell me that a lesson learned from anyone is still a lessoned learned, which is true, i suppose, but it is still keanu reeves, and he plays a chain smoking dentist The argument is further broken down into pathos and logos The pathos of this movie is most likely the strongest element, not because it is in anyway strong, but because the logos is poorly executed, there is no logic to this movie.
i am still not sure about the "killer" in this movie, OK i get he was an escaped mental patient that looked like an idiot, but was he also a super hero?
the style of this film is very out dated as previously mentioned they even decided it was a good idea to include a token wise cracking black guy in it all, along with the non stop techno music accompanied fight scenes, if at point you do feel drawn into what happening in front of you it so still dispelled by the drivel that holds it together.
still if you like formulaic,dated horror action films then you'll lap it up if not then it'll do as post pub fodder.
The first RE had a lot going for it.Nice cast.Good fx.Some suspense and general scares.A nice visual style.And a surprise ending that set the stage for a lot of promise to build on toward making one hell of a Horror flick.But a lot of people griped that Re was not like the game enough.Well the bad movie gods heeded their collective whine and have given them what they wanted.While the rest of us are still reeling from this disaster.
However, even when ignoring the numerous plot holes -- which is almost an impossibility -- the story itself is still laughable, revolving partly around an insipid "fight for survival" that seems to rely on the main group splitting up and one of the subgroups being brutally slaughtered for no good reason, with the other part being about Alice (a character invented by the script-writer, as she was never in the game it is very loosely-taken from) and her relationship with the monster "Nemesis".
JOE, fire a 100 shots and still no one's hit.
Yet it still kept an edge-of-your-seat level of suspense.
I always believed the ending could have been different, but it still left you with the sense that it was far from over.
They couldn't make it just like the original novel/movie, because the original is not that obscure, and there isn't any good way to change the story and still make a reasonable production.
In the second part, we get some cursory mention of the two survivors and some theorizing as to why they may still be alive... but then they're simply forgotten and don't even figure in the overall plot.
I saw this movie when it came out in 1979 (ironically at the same drive-in theater I managed in 1990) and it scared the daylights out of me then, and it still creeps me out today!
Well not counting commercials it is probably ONLY 3 hours but even still it is just not watching.
For example:   - Telepathic germs (you gotta be freaking kidding)   - Messages from the future (I freaking wish I was kidding) --- Note to future guys: instead of "739528", maybe "hey, look on the space station" would get your point across a little better  - Orbiting wormholes (still not kidding)  - Blackbird attacks that kill soldiers in helmets and full combat gear (shades of Alfred Hitchcock)  - Endless blather about "vent mining", and even a terrorist attack on a vent mining platform.
I'll never get those four hours back, but you still have a chance to miss this movie.
I'm sorry Michael Crichton is still alive to see this hack job of his masterpiece.
The plot is original, the acting acceptable, the special effects teetering on the cheesy, yet still utterly entertaining, this film is a must-see for any true horror movie fan.
At times the acting is a bit thin (but not terrible) and the story still has some holes in it (ie questions that could use answering) but what it does have going for it is a creepy atmosphere and a director that knows how to use suspense.
The agent, Keanu Reeves, is shown getting close to a surfer gal in order to get 'in' with the surfers; he tells her his parents died (which is a lie--they are still alive, we later find out, in Ohio) to gain sympathy from her, because he has found out thru records that her parents died in an accident when she was a child.
Even with at times bad plots, you still could watch it and not kick yourself in the head later for watching it.
But the redeeming side of it, was the relationship between the sisters and up till the first half of season 5, this was still present but severely diminished.
They killed him of in the worst possible way by sending Paige and Cole to an alternative dimension where he's still a demon and not a avatar.
I'd have to say the story and the way Danny St. Claire goes about calling her boss a 'Protoped' when she herself is still confused on the definition of said word.
After a half hour I started fast forwarding, then skipping sections to see if anything would happen and there was LOTS of bad acting and still whatever I'd skip to was long and boring and finally I couldn't watch anymore.
IT WAITS is a horribly disappointing creature movie about a young female forest ranger, still grieving over the accidental death of her friend, due to a car crash.
The movie has a nice look as well as a cool looking creature, sort of looking like the Creeper from Jeepers Creepers combined with Pumpkinhead, but it still seemed to be lacking in suspense and action.
May be a hero, but Peter's still a MAN!
I still would have given it 3/10, but right now it's in the top 250.
Phantasm is one of the most creative horror films from the late 70's/80's.From the imagination of Don Coscarelli,it doesn't play like a slasher film,it's a lot more clever.The setting of the horror is a Funeral home/Cemetery.A smart move,people fear funeral homes/graveyards because they associate them with death.I'd say it a cemetery is a smart place to set a horror film,because we fear it to begin with.The plot is about a boy named Mike,who lives with his brother Jody,they have a friend named Reggie who is an ice cream driver.Mike/Jody/Reggie are the main characters of the film.Their friend is killed in the cemetery.They bury him in the cemetery.Mike hides in the bushes,and sees the funeral home director known as The Tall Man,take the casket.He suspects something is wrong.Mike doesn't hesitate to investigate the cemetery.He sneaks into the mausoleum,where a flying sphere nearly kills him.The Tall Man attacks him,and he cuts off The Tall Man's fingers.Yet the finger still moves,he locks it in a box,and shows it to Jody.Jody decides that they have to investigate.They encounter dwarf slaves,they look like Jawas on film,but I'll forgive Don,because of the low budget.These Dwarf slaves are actually the corpses of the dead of the town.They bring Reggie in on it,and decide they have to find and kill The Tall Man.
So overall, it's probably one to skip since even with the missing chunk in place (which it isn't), it's still not a great movie by any stretch.
And while it is still easy enough to get the gist of the plot, the background in those minutes would have been nice.
Fortunately the plot is simple and you can pick it up easily but you'll still be burning at the Faux Pas.
Then you think, well maybe he's still alive, after all, in the first movie you thought Lou Gossett Jr's character was killed and yet he turns up alive and well at the end!
The fun fact is the Plymouth HemiCuda is a rad car back then, and still is now.
We also had Night at the museum 2, which wasn't art but was still decent.
We get it, but it still doesn't make the movie any better.
My attorney is still trying to get me listed in the credits as the "Out-of-focus-concession-patron-guy-#1".
If the sound of that sonorous, ball-rattling growl wasn't enough to make you wet yourself, you needed to check your pulse to see if it was still there.
There is nothing more to say, while many of the old actors are still there, several of them died under recording, unfortunately this wasn't enough to stop this atrocity from being made.
If they had a written a decent story and stuck to the whole caper aspect of the movie, this might've been a pretty decent (though likely still obscure) story.
Oh, so he's dealing stamps, he's still dealing with criminals, or people he must be smart enough to know are criminals, so that doesn't make it much better, does it?
but i must say that Donnie Yen still rocks!!
They were accompanied by spooky noises or music, but they still dragged on for way too long.
Compared to most other martial arts movies... it still sucks!
Cool, but still so super fast and therefor less cool then it could have been.
It managed to keep me watching, but merely to see something spectacular happen (and I'm still waiting) A BIG problem here is that the movie does not fit much with the first one: the 1993 film was set in the 19th century.
Iron Monkey would not have been so bad if it had been subtitled instead of dubbed over, but it would still have been awful.
There are a few pluses here: the many explosions, James Woods in a decent crazy villain role, and a shower scene with the two attractive stars, but still - something's missing.
The action sequences such as the Sly kicking ass and taking names while encountering a couple of thugs on a bus and throwing one out the window, a hotel room explodes and collapses into the ocean with the bad guys still in it, and the funky way Sly sets traps for the bad guys gives this movie redemption.
The Specialist is a terrible film which I hated when I saw it back in the 90's & still hate now when I saw it but a few hours ago, there's nothing much more I can say other than I personally think it's complete rubbish except some decent explosions at the end which aren't worth waiting for.
The story is lifted directly from 'Hollywood's clichÃ© underdog story writing' manual, yet the writer/director still manages to destroy this basic formula.
I can remember loving the first two flicks, and I still do enjoy them.
I am a huge fan of the first and second Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, they were both fun films that even the oldest adult could still have fun too, I grew up with the cartoon and movies, so I just loved them from minute one.
But like the most complex of David Lynch films, there are still some parts of the puzzle that are too warped to fit.
It's not an ordinary finger, it oozes some kind of yellow puss (embalming fluid perhaps) and still pokes around on it's own.
Raphael is still gray on that decision, but Donatello wants very much to go.
I would have enjoy it more if the movie continued with the Turtles still fighting crime in New York.
Well after the amazing first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film and the second not quite amazing but still good Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2:The secret of the Ooze the turtles return to the big screen for the unlucky third time where in the first 2 films they had a great opening sequence like in the first we had never seen the turtles on the big screen and really alive before so they kept that suspense going for about a awesome 10 Min's we finally see them all together right after there about to jump at the main titles and in the second one the turtles all jump up and the main title goes right there it was pure awesome and everyone couldn't wait for them to come up.....but in the third there is no thought no imagination its just the turtles dancing witch couldn't even succeed at being funny and brings me to splinter witch if you think splinter was an undeveloped character in the second...wait until you see him in the third splinter is supposed to be a main character that teaches the turtles but in this movie he just stands in his under ground house and at least the first two films he looks really cool but in this film he looked like a puppet behind a wall and only appeared in a few scenes witch was pointless so lets get to the plot April buys a some sort of time warp thing and warps the turtles in time and this movie would have been good story and have something that fans wanted such as shredders return and the debut a krang if thats what you are hoping to get......your wrong...instead you get 2 weird stupid undeveloped characters that nobody cared for why?
Sincerely, I still don't understand why they did the film.
Well, the Turtles are still selling on comic book stands, and you can still see some of their adventures on DVD, but as to whether it survived the 1990s is a matter of opinion.
Sure, they are still portrayed by men in suits, and those suits are still maintained by the Henson workshop, but the overall tone of the turtles' skin and the motion of their mouths indicates that Golden Harvest told the Henson workshop that they just wanted something passable.
One of the reason why Phantasm is such a unique film is the well established characters unlike most Horror films; whilst the acting is somewhat absent from the strongly written character it's still enough to redeem the awkwardly delivered lines, odd facial expressions and comical snappy reactions.
It was filmed by Nassour Studios, though the team was still under contract to Universal.
And the story still has some good spots during most of the first disc.
Of course, it is slightly better since you can still use items, unlike part VIII(But at least 8 was still good)  Don't get me started on the characters.
The ATB system still functioned exactly as it did before, with none of the refinements you would expect to see in a game on a more powerful system.
At the end of the game, Shinra is still bad, Sephiroth is still loony, the party members act the same way, etc.
I really enjoyed the effect of this (remember, this is 1979 when effects still took some creativity).
Written, directed, photographed, produced and edited by Don Coscarelli, this doesn't make much sense but it's still a great bit of fun to watch with the lights turned out.
This movie has many different layered meanings, over the years some people have said that it's a reference to corporate America coming in (in the form of The Tall Man) and killing off everyone (by turning everything into a 'business') and some have said that this movie is also about a kid's loss of innocence and fears about everyone around him leaving (or in this case dying) Whatever the hell this movie is about it's still great fun followed by a couple of really disappointing (and belated) sequels.
While both overdone and underdone at times, it still serves us a reminder that people are people and we should try and forget the stereotypes we create.
I found the humor somewhat forced and obvious, which you expect, but they have in the past still made it fresh.
Even if this film wasn't based on a classic Christie novel, it would still NEVER, EVER deserve to be garnered with that amount of stars.
I could at least respect, if still disagree, if this commentator had said they liked the original film version better than the novel.
The virgin writers still have a lot of work to do.
I saw an episode a few years ago, which was so disturbing, i still can't get it out of my mind.
I think that this series tells you that it is alright for men to beat up their wives which may lead to the wives beating their children, or they could be forced to admit they do by their animal husbands, but the wives should still be punished, even though they're being led to believe this is the way to treat people.
And if you watch this film from beginning to end you will see why this makes all the sense in the world, yet it is still an abstruse concept that is meant to be exactly what it is.
9 out of 10----As I said, I still can't tell you what this film is all about nor can I tell you what it all means or how it all ends, all I can say is that it made me feel something strange with it's disingenuous stroke of the brush.
it still reminds me of the trees in the Wizard of Oz.
I'm sorry, but I still can't understand why so many people like this movie?
Some good camera work, but it still feels like a Leaver it to Beaver episode.
Hearts in Atlantis had an esp element in its plot and still managed to seem more true to life than this cartoon.
The Only question that came to my mind after watching this film was - Wowwwwwwwwwwww how can someone make such an awful film and still get 9.5 rating in IMDb???????
If you still think your discovery holds after you've gotten a good scientific background knowledge, then you should have also gotten to know some people with whom you can discuss it...
What the hell happened i still don't know the bald heads were to many to tell who was who...i want my money back I've been cheated.
The budget isn't large for this movie, that's obvious and still the director pulled some extremely good shots and some solid acting while being uneven at times (considering the budget, I can only guess that some takes as to be done only a few times), still, beyond that there is nothing to properly think of.
As said, the story was somewhat promising at the beginning ... and sadly looks still promising at the end, it's a tale with a slow beginning and no real end or ground to rely on - an etheral narration with some pretty visuals and scenes empty of meaning.
Overall, the movie itself isn't bad and you can see it without regrets it's still a nice movie but it's nothing more and that is probably the most disappointing thing about it : you don't feel more than looking at an OK film.
A movie that I would recommend that still has a magical feel to it would be the 1976 version of Freaky Friday.
You know at one point I thought I saw the price label still hanging on one of the zombie masks, it looked like it was 12 dollars.
On her way Rebecca picks up a hitchhiker named Stan James (Timothy Prindle) who also lives near the lake, they quickly become friends as Rebecca still feels bad about her parents & needs a shoulder to cry on.
Having said that it still looks cheap, bland, forgettable, flat & extremely dull.
We would still have a bad movie.
However, I still just can't bare to give this a one.
The end of the movie made absolutely no sense....it made my head hurt and my girlfriend still has a confused look on her face the next morning ;) I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for examples of no talent....otherwise...curl up on the toilet with a nice magazine and you'll probably be more entertained.
And I still wonder how the lead-lady figured out the secret of "now is the 13th year, so they are going to kill 13 people", for instance.
I've watched it twice recently, but i still haven't managed to pick up the story.
I'm still puzzled about that.
That and a later routine with Ted in which the boys perform "The Elevator Dance" (in which Larry stands still while Moe hand pops his mouth and Shemp rubs sandpaper together) which has "no steps to it" are the funniest parts of the movie.
He's the taciturn, muscular guy who can be thrown into an empty elevator shaft by three hoods, save himself after falling down a few floors by grabbing a cable and sliding to a halt, haul himself up to a doorway into an empty warehouse, and deck the three armed goons who still pursue him.
So, if the New World Order wants to kill 80% of all people, why Alex Jones is still alive.
In GREASE, she was (and still is) the embodiment of sex appeal in those black tights and red slides, but she also looked beautiful and appealing in her girl-next-door costumes.
Then he still has to bring back her other daughter, the sinister Katy, back to the heavens.
That would make this film the most ambitiously complex and admirably disguised rip-off ever made, but still a failure nevertheless.
I'm a 14 year old and I still love this movie!
Someone mentions the tapes the Moors murderers made where they recorded the deaths of their victims, Longford goes out into the garden to see if it's still sunny out.
In England, the American pathologist Dr. Richard Murray (Jeff Fahey) still grieves the death of his wife Carol (Geraldine Alexander) eight months ago in a car crash.
I am not talking about just story here, because you can have a bad story but still keep people guessing for more.
Not as good as another similar one called Session 9, but still a fairly entertaining horror thriller about a mental institution.
Want to see an archaeologist who's been poking around in an abandoned building "for months," but still has no idea of its floor plan?
Despite knowing that the film industry will always sacrifice originality (and therefore risk) to make money it still amazes and annoys me that rubbish like this gets made.
Should you still choose to watch it, remember you were warned.
The special effects as far as Superman flying, and using heat vision were at their best here, but still this wasn't enough to save the movie.
(God rest his soul...)   Okay...I'm still waiting for someone to explain how someone with no computer training or education can solve this unsolvable code...using print statements!
when i saw this for the first time i was more of a kid than now......a little kid and i was a big superman movies fan.....i even liked this one a bit....and when i see it right now i still enjoy some of it....it is enjoyable to see superman turn evil....it is the best part of the movie....or maybe the only good part of it......richard pryor is too dumb at some parts of the movie and the opening credits belong to a Charles Chaplin movie.....a bad Charles Chaplin movie........the musical score is not bad.....mostly because it is filled mainly with John Williams' music but still it could've been much better........the only excellent thing in this film is Christopher Reeve's performance......but the rest is disappointing....specially when the big computer battles superman....disappointing but certainly better than the fourth superman movie........** out of 5
It's one of the highpoints of the entire series, yet still can't avoid being disappointing by the overall poor quality of the production.
As a stand-alone movie, not connected to the show, it still stinks, but man...it kills Thomas in a way I've never seen before.
Even in the original Japanese, Angel Cop would have still limped in over the finish line somewhere around the 99th place mark.
I was still waiting for an explanation when the credits rolled.
I still don't understand why so many people hated this movie.
Secondly, we've come a long way, except that black people are still often cast as the violent criminal in popular entertainment...just like in this one.
That one poster actually commends this absurd gay-bashing propaganda as a worthy film that should be remastered and shown to kids today suggests how much ignorance and unexamined bigotry is still out there.
The later TV adaptations, coming into being alongside Christopher Awdry's extension of the book series, wandered somewhat further afield from the feel of the originals, but were still recognisably on-model even though I am aware that Wilbert became somewhat frosty towards Britt Allcroft for deviating from his vision.
Hewitt is mediocre at best, Hopkins phones his performance in (but still blows away Hewitt in their scenes together) and Alec looks bored.
He's a rebel who still is mainly good inside but he gets in too deep and along the way gets to f**k insanely hot chicks.
So despite its many flaws, I still must reluctantly recommend it for younger children, who clearly love it - just be forewarned that as an adult you may have a very difficult time sitting through it over and over again, even if you are a kid at heart like myself.
In fact I'll stop typing this right now, because that movie is still occupying my time, and not another second...
Word has it that Miss Stiles will also appear in four more movies in 2000 -- there's still hope!
I am in college, and have had a relationship in college and this movie still didn't make sense.
But Chucky is still watchable.
He's still somewhat creepy I guess, but now it's nothing but good old humor!!
Absolutely not, I still can't believe this use 2 give me goose bumps!
But still not good enough.
No explanation is given as to who this demon is or where he came from & Goyer also throws in some of those annoying dream sequences & the demon taking the form of dead characters trying to trick those still alive, you know the sort of thing.
Great title, below average film but still maybe worth a watch if your absolutely desperate or a killer toy film fan.
Even though Steven Seagal has made movies who are much worse than this, this is still far from being his best work.
Some of the fights in this movie still are pretty cool, but there are just something that isn't there.
I didn't realize the same guy who did certain Outer Limit and Star Trek episodes was still alive (tilt the camera 45 degrees).
However I still believe the most insightful, smart, intelligent, powerful Skinhead flick is "The Believer".
Despite the fact that I'm slating it, I still gave it 4/10.
He still loves it 2 years later.
Even if I agreed with All the Rage's blatant anti-gun agenda (I don't) I would still have to say that it sucks.
Again my feelings about the "anti-gun" agenda aside, agenda or no, this is still a very bad movie.
I am not a child but I still think that children should be shown a sense of consistency from the TV series.
Months after watching It's The Rage, I'm still not sure what the director and writer were trying to accomplish.
Nonetheless, the statement that guns are a bad thing in the hands of the wrong people is still a valid one.
Even the bad kid isn't that bad he shoplifts a couple of sodas (I think) the bullies aren't that scary,I mean what's so bad about riding your bike around the nerdy girl granted she'd get dizzy ,but still.
Oh I wish that Joel, Crowe and Tom were still in business.
And Erin Moran of TV's "Happy Days" should be ashamed of herself for agreeing to appear in this (she also gets the unfortunate task of having the most gruesome sendoff in the film, a moment that still makes me cringe big time).
It is hard to rate a movie that is so bad, but still can be very amusing.
And yet it looks like another wise investment for master Corman, as "Galaxy of Terror" is still a guilty pleasure of many horror fans and it's frequently mentioned as one of the more tolerable "Alien"-imitations ever made.
"Galaxy of Terror" is unpretentious and relaxing entertainment, but still it could have been a lot better.
This is a far glossier presentation than Talaat Captan's earlier work such as Digital Man and A.P.E.X., but it's still glaringly low budget.
He discovered (as he discovered in many other episodes) that he is still a human being.
With all that being said, it was still a great learning experience and having Lion's Gate on the resume can't be all bad.
But I still think it was unnecessary to be so graphic; but he truly shares the perils of heroin addiction in the most real way.
There are still many questions to be answered and many things to be resolved.
This one hour show was combined and intercut with another and retitled "Power, Passion and Murder" and still shows up on TV occasionally.
Margaret's boyfriend Robert Wyatt (a totally bland Eric Lutes) tries to solve the mystery, along with dodgy treasure hunter Corbeck (Louis Gossett Jr., who still sounds and acts like the Drac he played in Enemy Mine) and ex-copper Daw (Mark Lindsay Chapman).
Don't crawl back into your couch as an avalanche of bad scenes is still coming your way: bad special effects (toy helicopters anyone?
Juan Piquer Simon is sometimes compared to Ed Wood, but at least Wood had a vision (a vision hindered by a budget, but still a vision).
It doesn't really do anything & I struggle to see why anyone would like it & even at a brisk 20 odd minutes in length it still bored me.
Well, that's not entirely true as I had seen her hardcore/horror hybrid COME WITH ME, MY LOVE back in the day when the lady still vehemently denied any involvement in the explicit side of the sex film industry.
I gave this movie a two because it never made me want to kill my self... but its still very, very bad.
Even though it was funny beyond words it is still a very very bad movie, everything in it, there is now faint sign of hope for any of those people who participated in it.
This is maybe one of the director's more intriguing ideas, were he want's to show us that time doesn't stand still even in Olympus and that they actually have cars there.
The Bad Points: Cuneta's acting was lackluster (I still think she can do best in drama films over comedy ones).
I've been out of a competitive drumline for 25 years, and I can still play better than they did.
The message in this movie seems to be you can treat non-human living beings as horrible as you want, use them, dispose of them, and you will still be their master.
In the end, even if the father is brought back to life by the dog, the father is still a loser, poor, and can't get a date.
Dickey is still dumb and picked on at school.
Now I feel inexplicable anger that such raging self indulgent sh*t can still make it onto the cinema screen.
the film actually had an interesting start -3 young woman on a girls holiday meets a group of lads on holiday in a rented boat, drinks, drugs, flirting and banter... at this point you are still awaiting the film to really kick in, however up until this point, the film is still more than just watchable, which i thought had potential to continue in its tracks... suddenly, the whole film changes direction, they 'lose the plot' so to speak.. after a perfectly filmed porno styled orgy scene where the infamous DONKEY PUNCH DEATH occurs and the the carnage begins... words cannot explain how unrealistic the rest of the film plays out.. completely idiotic unbelievable murderous acts coming at you like flock of seagulls until all but the 'good girl' is left.. it was laughable.
It's quite a feat to take a really good play, give it a great cast, and still manage to make a bad movie.
Harland along with the couple still locked in the 60's made this movie.
The story and film, however, are still top notch and stand the test of time, in my opinion.
But, I still prefer Champion as my all time favorite.
I gave up on this channel a long time ago but still see pieces of shows when I flip by and they are all terrible except for the reruns which they can't really take credit for.
Perhaps this elevated his image above the work he left behind in film - but still, this film and a handful of others are quite good.
You can make films to please the box-office that don't completely massacre your intelligence as well and still have the final product (that's what they seem to call it, because they don't make films anymore ) be intrinsically Bollywoodish.
He still seems to be stuck in the 1970's school of directing on this film, with very old school camera zooms and over indulgent scenes, like the scene in which Jones walks through Yemen and the over-long opening of the Yemen riot scene.
Unlike A Few Good Men, still the best of its kind, Rules of Engagement falls flat because even as none of the character actions make sense, nothing is surprising either, and that is the biggest sin of all.
When it isn't daft, it's risible: a couple of weeks after being machine-gunned and having one of her legs amputated, the six-year-old victim is out of hospital and miraculously adept with her crutches (whilst other victims of the same blood bath still lay in their hospital beds with the same bullet holes and blood stains).
I knew it wasn't going to be a HotDog-ish movie, but I was still expecting something fun.
I think this movie just tried to be too many things that just didn't fit together - trying to make HotDog into a chickflick while still being cool is just plain impossible.
But it's still tragedy played for lower middle-brows who will weep generous tears as the director manipulates their sentimentality and rakes in the shekels.
One of the greatest casts ever assembled help this, otherwise turgid, melodrama to chug along for over two and a half hours, (three, if you are unlucky enough to catch the US video version), but they still can't manage to lift it above the level of a second rate television movie.
Furthermore, starving families still exist (although Stella's mother does well to encourage ignoring that), wars continue and isolated tragedies like Unity's go unabated, yet the intertitle states "all's right with the world."
It turns out, that Stella has only moved from one fairytale to another--she is still oblivious, and the film itself, it seems, is a fairytale just as bogus as the one Stella was originally led to believe.
To be frankly, I used to think that he was the no.1 guy in Chinese film production, I can still recall those tear-shedding moments that he gave me through his unique and humane perspectives and works.
Yet, I still don't understand what this movie is trying to tell me.
However, I still don't have a clue what "The Promise" is about.
there are certain situations where you can understand why it is needed but in this case they could have done the standard skin tight sari's and clothes and still got away with it.
Charlie also realizes what a jerk he's turned in now getting his brains beat out in order to enrich a bunch of gangsters who'll use him for as long as he's is still useful to them and when he isn't they'll drop him just like they did Ben.
Albert Brooks still knows how to spin off a great one-liner but something has happened to this man since the great "Defending Your Life".
Sure, we got in free, but we still want to bill Eddie Murphy for wasting our evening.
It's still an effective movie, however.
Part camp, part thriller, part adventure, part comedy, part sci-fi, part action part romance... and it still amounts to nothing.
Yet, Charlie Davis is likable, for despite the hardened exterior, he is still fundamentally a good man who is struggling to do what is right despite the pressure to cave in to those who merely want to use him.
Or when the Elite see the car of the bad guys, lying on a train railway, and say "They might still be alive", but then a train arrives and drives over the car, just classic.
Jeff Bridges was bureaucratic in K-PAX, but still convincing, he was like "hey, I'm so glad I got this role, I'm really enjoying being here!"
SPOILER, for those who still think they may bother to see it: The best (worst?
I couldn't believe there were still people left in the theatre at the end -- perhaps, like me, they were hoping that the Q&A would clear up their bewilderment.
I cannot understand why certain directors just do not retire as they shouldÂ Ermanno Olmi delighted us with at least one masterpiece (L'Albero degli Zoccoli), a lot of boring movies, but never had he attained such a horrible levelÂ and still there are reviewers on the web that hold this movie in good opinion (have a look on Google and you'll see)!
At that time the Gable hood with flowing lappets hanging below the shoulders was still in.
She suffered emotionally and financially due to the marriage, but was still glad she finally married for love.
I still watch reruns of Three's Company whenever I can...  -Al
It treats the subject with dignity, gravity and a cast that is fully committed to the material (not to mention it is still scary as all hell, too).
Christine Moore, does good with the lousy script, however she had her off moments, still i liked her, plus she's gorgeous!,but her chemistry with, Gary Warner is off.
She is 39 in this film--18 years past her yummy Suzie Wong debut--and still looks very beautiful.
Heck, she's still a looker TODAY, at 68!
I still firmly believe the above could form a fantastic starting point for an exhilarating and suspenseful Man Vs.
Lucilius (to Cleopatra); "After what happened last night I'm lucky my heart still beats at all."
Tom Cruise, though not terribly bad in his portrayal of Lt. Pete "Maverick" Mitchell, was still largely amateurish.
And as you may have gathered, I still have no clue what the movie was about.
Occasionally there's a lull in the proceedings that gives Dunne and MacMurray a chance to remind us that they're still the same old likable stars.
I still have nightmares from having to sit through that horrible movie.
The only thing worth recommending about this movie is the fact that you do get to see some attractive girls in schoolgirl uniforms, but once any enjoyment from that passes and an unsettling feeling of dirtiness settles over you, you'll still have 90+ minutes left.
Basically, the film is about Tripp (Matthew McConaughey), a man who still lives with his parents as an adult.
Tripp is a man in his thirties who still lives with his parents.
Given its middle aged focus and explicit sexual content, "Never Again" will play best with more mature audiences who can handle vulgar language, absurd comic relief, and still appreciate the sentimental and poignant moments without rationalization.
If you don't care much for either of these actors you will probably hate this movie... and if you are a big, big fan of either one of them... well, you probably still won't think much of it.
It shows up that a lot of American chicks are shallow, as they still go for the dropkicks, even though most of them have slept with heaps of women.
Incredible but true, people still think that in Sicily we live like that.
Jeffrey Tambor is a brave and always interesting actor, and Jill Clayburgh is one of the best American screen actresses - and still sexy at 54.
The plot trudges along through double-crosses and betrayals involving various police officers, mobsters, and the obligatory love interest (Kathryn Harrold, given little do since, even though his wife is awful to him and he's technically dead, he's still a dutiful married man).
Having seen this film 3 times I am still struggling to understand the raw deal arnie is given?
Although it has to be said, this is my favourite part of the film, I still cannot see its relevance in the overall storyline.
I won't spoil where and how he shows up, but let's just say it's twelve hours since I watched it and my ribs still feel a little sore from laughing.
"Kill Bill 2" is made as an Italian western (Ennio Morricone has vowed to kill anyone who'll still call these films 'spaghetti westerns') and you sort of feel this as you watch the film.
She still wins.
There was some kind of money in this movie, clearly, and some of the flashing lights and stuff amount to a dream date for stoners, but it's still an 80s sci-fi epic from the director etc.
They really need to have a warning for that, I'm still recovering.
Kirk Douglas is just ugly, clearly he took this role to show he was still a leading man, yes, he may be in shape at 64 years old (which is how old he was when this was made) but its creepy!
I had watched this as a kid on local TV in the early 1980s (when only black-and-white sets still existed in Malta!)
Craggy Morris Ankrum is just one of a number of familiar faces that populate the still engrossing after all these years Earth vs the flying saucers.
Credit Ray Harryhausen's dazzling special effects for much of the film's appeal; the scenes of the saucers zipping through the atmosphere still look great.
Now, instead of dragging her along (the zombies still wouldn't catch up) or closing the doors to keep her safe, they leave her there, only to stop 10 ft away to film her dying.
The acting is plain terrible, the script is awful, the camera won't stay still, the effects are decent according to the budget, and some parts will make you go "WTF?".
There's a bit more zombie action in this chapter and the make-up on the zombies is still quite realistic.
Nothing really good to say about this crap-fest....the acting as horrible,the script was lame,even if it was ad-libbed it was still bad stuff.Special effects non-existent,they mainly consisted of newspapers blowing around in the streets.The zombies were those half-ass done kind with just some pale makeup smeared and there and some blood dashed on here and there.Long camera shots of a dead spider on a counter and rain splashing in a puddle were also counted as special effects I assume.Apparently the special effects budget was shot in the opening scenes where a handful of soldiers wearing gear that looked like it was from WWII ran around for a few minutes taking cover behind objects as they moved toward some buildings as though they expected the zombies to shoot at them!
TZD tries to put seriousness back into the zombie genre, but there is one essential catch: no matter what kind of make-up you give them, zombies are still silly, comical creatures.
The trio leaving the village have put together a make-shift radio but as we soon realize there are few places to go where you can sit still very long.
They still would have been mindless idiots.
They could not afford good actors, the bad make-up effects are hidden by the poor image quality (intentionally poor image quality, but still...) and the script does a 360 at the end, branching to a cringe inducing subplot about a couple of serial killers that does nothing to move the so-called script forward.
I remember being 7 years old and watching Dawn of the Dead, it freaked me out, I had nightmares for weeks, even seeing it when I was 25 it still freaked me out.
You can shoot a feature-length movie on a home video camera with bad lighting, and it can still be good as long as the script is well-written and the characters are engaging.
More than almost anyone he raised set and production design to the level of art; and his sets for the silent Fairbanks Thief Of Baghdad are still eye-popping.
I still don't understand why so many critics thought this was such a great movie.
The action sequences are so preposterous that my eyeballs still ache from absorbing this audio visual toxin..
If you still want to watch this: 1.
They could have cut out much of it and still been faithful to the book.
And the first girl still wants to marry him.
Yesterday was a rainy day in California so I decided to watch this movie while my memory of the 1995 production is still fresh.
But 'Abominable" proofs that turkeys still exist in the genre.
But I found the movie as pretty lame, but still pretty fun to watch.
He appears to act as if his lawn furniture has come to life and he's not sure if it is reality or he's still stoned.Probably needs just a little more time to stare thoughtfully into the camera...I swore the deck chair just winked at me.
ComÃ©dia de Deus for me is the only movie that I ever ran away from, after some short debating with my two companions, leaving the other two spectators the cinema to themselves (I still sometimes wonder whether they managed to sit it out).
Well, the point still stood at the conclusion of the film.
Members of the chamber of commerce (or whatever) were interviewed while still under the impression that the WTO was really closing down, and they seem to think that it is a good idea to do so.
Though her acting has improved from the previous films (due to large part of her being voiced over) she still looks like she has nothing better to do then pace around in a scene to waste film and expand the films running time.
Problem is that by now few viewers still had the patience to follow his "vision", that had strayed so far from the original (and, by comparison, very entertaining) "Nemesis".
She was extremely intelligent,haughtily aware of her superiority though she never behaved in a condescending manner which would manifest her superior status -rather,she assumed it as a responsibility.She was ever judgemental of her own actions lest they should hurt another's feelings.A proud little soul, during her tribulations we repeatedly read in the pages of the book how her determined mind curbs a fit of pique, or accommodates her bodily wants and her emotional grievances through fanciful imaginings of better possibilities, so that destitute as she is she still gives freely from her heart , even if all she has to give are dreams and reveries, as we see in the successive visits she receives from Lottie and Ermengarde in her garret.It is the least a princess can do.
There's plenty of hand-to-hand combat sequences which could really hum if the director and cinematographer could keep their damn camera still long enough for us to enjoy it.
I grew up in Britain and still love old British comedies: Ealing, of course, Will Hay, Alastaire Sim, Peter Sellers, and so many others.
(1969) and Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965), both of which are set in times only slightly later than Three Men in a Boat and are equally far removed from contemporary audiences, but are still relatively amusing.
The silent movies of Chaplain and Keaton are still wonderful; the Three Stooges are still ridiculous and funny; much in Norman Wisdom's movies is dated, but when he falls through a window he is still hilarious.
I recall seeing this movie when I was young and being a fan of the book (the 'tin of pineapple chunks' scene is still the funniest bit of writing I've ever read) but having just watched it again, I am sorely disappointed.
Most of the minor deviations from the plot I assumed Â still do Â were because Sara had to be shown growing up and the story had to fit within length restrictions.
So, in summary, if you've never read the book, you're in for a nice surprise: comedy that is still funny after a hundred years and more, but don't let this film put you off.
It seems that his university has just purchased a coelacanthe--a primordial fish species that was discovered to still be alive in the 20th century.
I don't mind ambiguity in films, but still.
ON A SEPARATE NOTE: It is a shame that Bollywood is still producing anti-Pakistani movies.
"Our Hitler..." is the extreme example of 1970's  too much talk too little action self absorption (every word we blather out should be preserved- every idea however tangential and unfocused - is precious to preserve ...) film work - but there are still nuggets of visual and verbal power in this way way way way way way way way way way way way way way way too long film.
Is it the still bad conscience of the Germans themselves which cannot be made responsible for what their fathers or grandfathers did?
There are some good lines, decent kung fu action, and naked girls, but it still seems to lack something.
After all, he still had the royalties from the bionic shows coming in.
Like CYBORG, this is a very serious, very adult novel that still holds up well.
POSSIBLE SPOILERS:the screenplay is not that much strong,and the suspense is not really here.The first hour is boring and what remains is a spate of clichÃ©s:best/worst example:the killer,leaving "clues" on the dead body ,I've seen it (and read it) so many times that it leaves me amazed :how can a writer ,fifty years or so after Agatha Christie and co,still think of a such hackneyed idea?Giving the killer's identity or the key to the mystery half an hour or more before the ending can be rewarding (such was the case in "vertigo" (1958)),but here ,it destroys any fear:who could reasonably think that the hero -and his girl-could be really in jeopardy after that?Only a whodunit could sustain the interest till the very end.
.... may seem far fetched.... but there really was a real life story.. of a man who had an affair with a woman, who found out where he and his new wife were staying,, and she killed the wife,, making it look like a murder rape.......  in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him.. so she quit her job in Wisconsin... and moved to Minnesota..........  last I heard she was in a mental institution, Security Prison....  she was still wearing the "engagement ring."
I was particularly impressed with how the Merill character turned out-- she could have SO easily been the stereotypical vampy-sexy-screwed-up character, but she was so fragile and so NOT in charge of herself while still remaining appealing-- and with Cherry Jones, of course ("Sit down, Shelly"), and Sean Hatosy is heartbreakingly dear -- could he possibly be anything other than a small-town cop searching for stronger self-esteem?
I was literally counting how many characters are still alive, so I'd know how soon it'll all be over.
Anyway, they start getting all killed, of course, by the mutant sh*thead still in the houseÂ Or is there more than one killer mutant dude?
You learn everything you need to know from a two minute speech at the start of the movie (the bit where the guy explains the history of the house) and from then on the story is at a stand still.
Greek pledges find themselves in an abandoned mansion that is rumored to still be occupied by the deformed offspring of the owner.
C: A test by Kitano to see how long he can keep his camera still on his expressionless face, without giving us any insight into his character (apart from the fact that he's a cop, and he's violent)?
But one thing is for sure: by the time (SPOILER WARNING) Kitano gets hit by the 15th bullet or something and still doesn't fall down, it was clear that my second experiment with his films (after the equally awful "Brother") will probably be the last.
We kept on guessing the movie would show what 'it got' in the next 5 minutes, and we kept repeating that to ourselves every 5 minutes, but when the movie ended it still had not happened.
The first few incidents that indicate that something is about to go horribly wrong aren't creepy at all - at that stage the audience is still stuck behind the first hurdle of, "What is the POINT of this theme park, anyway?"
That is, if it's still on T.V.
(17) United Center/Chicago Stadium - The Bulls did not move into the United Center until the 1993-94 season, during which Jordan was temporarily retired; in the film, it is spring 1993, and Jordan pulls into a stadium parking lot, where he talks with some kids; you can make out a partially obscured sign in the background, which says, "ED CENTER"; the Bulls played in Chicago Stadium during the 1992-93 season, as the United Center was still under construction.
NCAA Championship won the game outright when in fact there was still time on the clock and the other team failed to score.
I only watched it once, and I still ask myself why I did.
The only frightening thing is that people still pay to see movies like this.
And then again, the pencils aren't long enough to get all the way through still being able to have a grip on it!
I think much of people's adulation of this show comes from the fact that at the time it was on the air, cable was still quite a luxury and being able to watch it was one of the bragging rights of elementary school.
Some of the dream sequences and close-ups of frightened eyes remind me distantly of Lucio Fulci but still, there's nothing in the imagery that would save the film.
It doesn't create atmosphere and terror as Frizzi did but is there in order to make the silent scenes not to look so dull, which they still are as well as the whole film.
They are quite sadistic and graphic at times, the "body splitting" and tongue impaling, being the most memorable examples, but still they are not as haunting as in the earlier films that were also effected by the soundtrack and visuals.
Even though she admits she still loves Gable and wouldn't have gone through with it if she'd found out he survived.
You know something is wrong when a movie is 3/4 of the way over and you still haven't got a clue what's going on!
My pleasure stems from watching the hero, Hunter (played by Michael Beck of 'The Warriors' deliver the monotone one-liners while still having the physical charisma to run, dive, punch, kick, and shoot.
If the creators of Mystery Theater 3000 were still doing their magic, this film would be a perfect candidate for parody.
I am still uncertain about how I feel about this movie.
My anticipation level was even higher than for The Crying Game 2 (which still has yet to be produced).
I have been a fan of Michael Ende since childhood and, although this interpretation of the Neverending Story strays from the plot of the book, I still found it delightful to watch.
The film's second act begins when Kit's father loses his car dealership (it's interesting that he was still able to have a thriving business as late as 1934!).
So he reassures Kit that he intends to remain in Cincinnati (despite the fact that there is still no work for him there).
This is still a Classic film made in 1958 and ten years later, Boris Karloff passed away to the Higher Stage in the real Spiritual World.
Avenging partner who looked like he had been a cop for all of two minutes, but was still able to offer cryptic life-affirming advice to Tom (who looked twice his age).
Doesn't matter that it "isn't real", it is still depiction of animal abuse/torture.
Several of the players survived him including, John Hoyt, William Conrad, Peter Mammokos (who is still living 50 years later), Chuck Roberson (stuntman, no screen role in this film), and the Duke's son Pat Wayne, who still lives.
If John Wayne still thought of his character as a 'cowboy', he should have tried to imagine a real cowboy- or even a fictional cowboy- speaking lines like that.
The military had been doing atomic bomb testing near the location before the film, and the area was still hot.
When Fox refused to cooperate, Howard Hughes apparently remembered that John Wayne still had one more picture left on the RKO contract he signed back in 1939.
The whole concept of the previous highlander movies is bypassed, but thankfully they still keep enough sense to not mess up the time line for the other movies, of which one is set in the future.
I just looked back at my notes on Highland: Endgame, still the only other Highlander movie I've yet to see (also never seen an episode of the show), and an a little surprised at how high it was rated then even at a C+ grade.
But it's still a waste of any viewer's time, even for die-hard fans.
But once that is past, then one is left with direction that seems to come out of a school that is based entirely on a time when MTV still made music videos, with touches of would-be 300 knock-off thrown in either as unintentional or as sucker-punching for genre fans.
The bewigged, face lifted, slimmer and worked out, but, still so very handsome, Adrian Paul is back as the Highlander.
I watched this on the Sci-Fi channel, which means that I didn't have to shell out money for a movie rental or a theater viewing, but it still cost me dearly: two hours of my life have been spent.
And that would still be more than they spent on the original.. 2/10
Kristy Swanson is still pretty, but by no means as irresistible as she's supposed to be here.
However, I still found the film watchable enough to give it *1/2 out of 4 stars.
The plot is great for an action movie - Its the early 1980s, and POWs are still being held in viet nam.
So he heads back on an official US diplomatic thing, but he has an agenda of his own - to singlehandly break out POWs that are still being held.
Kalatozov fails to harness his tremendous visual talent as he did in THE CRANES ARE FLYING, certain scenes flailing for attention but lacking the dramatic pull to justify them, but still someone who likes movies for their pictorial quality, for the endless possibilities of capturing images with a photographic lens and moving inside a thridimensional canvas; such a person will be left in awe and admiration of what Urusevsky achieves.
I saw this on TV and still somehow feel like I'm owed a monetary refund.
And it's a shame, because it does start promising enough and there is a funny moment here and there ... but not nearly enough to grant this movie more than two stars ... it's still a waste of time!
So, even if this review gets voted as "zero-out-of-a-hundred found it useful," I'm still urging my fellow movie-goers to boycott this movie, and spend their money on a full-fledged vacation.
With that in mind, it still never fails to stupefy that in an industry of such excruciating rehashes, Hollywood can still churn out a film which exemplifies the above conventions and still manage to up the ante in terms of sheer lack of quality and coherence.
While he escapes with more dignity than others concerned, it is still nothing less than a shame to see a promising upcoming talent reduced to such a point.
I know this is a movie and thus not a real depiction of any reverend, but still...it was very discerning to watch. )
But now I realize simply that I have been watching good movies, and "License to Wed" is a healthy reminder to myself that I can still recognize the sight of horrid cinema when it veers before my eyes.
Mandy Moore is still Mandy Moore: Beautiful and talentless when working with lazy scripts.
I felt sorry for this couple that this guy was still a part of their lives, and imagined what hell awaited them in the future.
It is very strange for such hyper patriotic movie but it seems to be pretty anti-patriotic sometimes as officers do smoke Havana cigars (isn't it still illegal in US?).
I rented this DVD for $1 as a weekly, and I still feel ripped off.
It still would.....suck.
However, even with those somewhat high marks added to it, "Mom At Sixteen" still fails in it's attempts at coming across as realistically as possible due greatly to the facts that the characters are not as well-written nor nearly as fully-developed as they should have been, and even the story itself takes too many twists right smack in the middle of it which ultimately causes the remainder of the film to fall apart towards the extremely unsatisfactory and sadly contrived ending.
Yes, people lived like this, and still do.
Despite this,however,there was one good joke in it which I still remember after all this time,about the squirrel in the forest.
And I still can't figure it out even after seeing all these times, aside from leaving a bitter aftertaste.
Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal's fake Argentinean accent is awful, but he still gives a good performance.
I appreciated significantly more those that ran 2 episodes for just under an hour, even with the fade-outs still causing boredom.
When I searched for it before, I took a road trip across all of my country's video stores and still didn't find it.
So, in one segment a group of characters are talking, and it suddenly jumps to fifteen minutes later in a different room, and they're still talking, and we're left wondering what on earth is going on.
However the rest of this film lacks his typical visionary edge and I suppose it's because he was still learning (and that's clear in every frame).
But, this is still a good Western which doesn't follow the conventional theme/structure narrative.
Plot: A serial murder tries to kill some local small town teens before they ruin any respect we may still have for comedy.
Most of the actors in this movie aren't known too well, and I don't think it would even matter if they got better known actors, because this movie would still be horrible.
Then, we are treated to Divine shopping and you assume Pearce is still lying in the car bleeding.
I still love this movie.
In one of the scenes notice that they are dancing on top of the World Trade Center as it is still being built.
This film was a solid attempt to reach people with the Gospel of Jesus while still portraying him as the Messiah rather than just a spiritual leader.
The impression of great adventures brought distinctively to life in "I Love a Mystery" is still vivid in my memory.
They move away but nothing changes, Jacey still wants her baby, she wants to be a mother.
Worse still, Ralph Staub (who squeezed maybe a dozen feature assignments in between his excruciating "Screen Snapshots" series) has handled TMM in a mercilessly heavy-handed and thoroughly routine style that totally smothers every latent spark of wit in a screenplay that was none too promising to begin with.
Man, I'd really be worried for Maxine Gates if she were still alive with this "desimone_ken" character on the loose (sheesh).
It showed that even though those girls have kids they are still just like us.
It's still enjoyable because upper middle class London in the 1950s, the relationships among the people, their entertainments, the beauty of the homes, the clothes, the accents, is a pretty enjoyable place to be for this movie's duration.
Yet the movie is still enjoyable - the characters of Gregory Peck, Charles Laughton, Charles Coburn and Louis Jourdan are well-drawn and enjoyably relate to each other.
If Hitchcock and these stars were not involved in this movie, no one would ever watch it, and it would probably still sit gathering dust somewhere, unreleased for home viewing.
I'm a 22 Year old male, and i do have a daughter of my own, this movie was great, from the start i was glued to the screen and i was still there at the end, and i didn't even move to grab a drink, or go the loo.
It's like having a kazoo band provide background music for your dinner party - no matter how many leitmotifs and riffs and themes they play, it's still kazoo music, and you wish they'd shut up and let some actual instruments play...or even allow some restful silence.
She plays a mom who is still in High School and has her divorced mom takes care of her son while she's in school.
Nope, still haven't found it after watching this.
Some people still can't believe that anyone expects great acting, etcetera, from low-budget films, and shouldn't criticize anything without a big budget.
Despite the best efforts of Hoolywood...you occasionally still see a compelling drama, and this is one.
I'm still laughing every time I think of this movie, it's just, how do movies like this get green lighted?
Anyway, and then you have all the capacity to start with: a great landscape, fairly decent actors, average budget, CGI that sucks only to a point where it's still bearable, but then... *drum roll* ULI EDEL rears his ugly head, to top it all!
Acting isn't much, but you still see the occasional wonderful camera moves and he has always used music very convincingly.
It's hard to believe that in this day and age, with a significant amount of resources and first-class collaborators like Ennio Morricone, Gerard Brach and Julian Sands, the picture still manages to completely fail in any kind of dramatic sense.
I have loved this story since I was a child and as an adult I would still like to have it in my memory as a good story, not some type of killer film.
What a total let-down!What a huge disappointment!I still can't believe that Dario Argento was responsible for this Hollywood-influenced piece of garbage.It's simply a romance with some splashy gore thrown in.All of Argento's trademarks are gone here:no cool camera angles,no Goblin music,no playing with colors,no black-gloved killer,no bizarre dreamlike sequences,and worse of all,absolutely no suspense.The direction is very flat,the acting is horrible and the characters are not interesting at all.The gore scenes are well-done,but the film is extremely boring.All in all,"Phantom of the Opera" is pretty hard to sit through since it is so lame and unscary.I wouldn't be able to watch this trash again.I only hope that Argento's next horror project "I Can't Sleep" will be really worth watching.Avoid "Il Fantasma dell'opera" like the plague.Better watch "Suspiria" or "Deep Red" again.Not recommended.
But I DID see the aforementioned film so this one while still horrid, doesn't seem bad in comparison.
The fight scenes are still incredibly cool, of course, but not worth sitting through two hours of cheesy dreck.
The old kung fu teacher's leaping-and-shouting related death, and the fact that his body still stands there looking annoyed afterwards.
I've never had a long shot finish in the money, and thanks to Daddy Day Care,I still haven't had the big one come in.
I'm thinking there's still a chance Daddy Day Care can recover and get better.
To be honest I still had some respect left for Eddie Murphy before this.
You could do worse ("Wrong Turn" may still be playing at a theatre near you), but this is just the sort of formulaic Hollywood psuedo-family comedy that is so tried and true it should work, but falls short in every laughless scene.
It was stupid and kind of had a weak story but I still liked it.
Perhaps you think it will be different for you, maybe you're too cool for the room and able to appreciate the finer aspects of the struggling low budget film that still respects the art man.
I rented this movie the other night, and I'll be damned if I still don't have a clue as to what is going on throughout this movie.
But I have to agree with those who still find something enjoyable on it.
After watching it, I still came to the conclusion that it's a poolhall junkies ripoff and a poorly executed one too.
I saw the bad reviews on this one, and decided to rent it anyway because I love pool and I'm still waiting for a decent pool movie.
Lastly, the only reason why this film gets a 1, is because they are after some rare diamond (although the plot is still pathetic) and the beginning titles was actually decent (like showing the 7 ninjas individually).
U.K. actor Roger Rees plays Nat Banks, a Virginian farmer who even after living his whole life in the South still hasn't been able to stop speaking with a British accent (seriously, he does, and without explanation).
Dick Van Dyke still looks reasonably good (for a man of nearly eighty).
They should have done this in 1984, not 2004: all of the actors would have been alive still (except perhaps Richard Deacon, depending when they filmed), unsedated, and not all that old; and maybe Carl Reiner would have been fresher as a writer.
we have money and we're still alive and kicking!
Like Sean Connery, Bill Shatner, and Paul Newman, the aging actor still has more to offer the audience than do the clueless folk running today's film and TV studios.
As it was, I still had to rely on Cliffs Notes to alert me to the mythic and Christ allusions.
I still found no redeeming value in this "spoof".
I know that after WWII, Bud and Lou had some serious tax problems and lost their fortunes, but I would have assumed by 1952 and with a lot of films behind them they still didn't need money THIS badly!
Abbott and Costello were only a bit beyond their prime, ready to do the first year of their still beloved television series.
Although Selleck is bad, he still delivers the best performance in this film, because the other actors are so incredibly bad -- perhaps with the exception of Nigel Bennet who plays Harrison Pendelton who's good, but unfortunately only on screen for about a minute throughout the whole film.
'The Van' represented a slight change of direction for Doyle, a weighter piece of fiction than his earlier efforts; but it's still fun, and a sensitive portrait of male friendship.
There's nothing wrong with films aimed at kids as long as it still treats its audience with a certain amount of intelligence.
Like I said before, the whole script is riddled with such silly contrivances that it was almost impossible for me to enjoy it but being a fan of S&S films, it's watchable for sure, but then I would watch the cheesiest of them all and still be entertained.
If you're still not sure, just watch the very stupid ending and all that I've said becomes clear.
Even after the women make life-altering changes, they still look weepy and pathetic.
They killed the Ra' Zac easily when the Ra' Zac are still in the third book.
There are way too much "memorable quotes" in the movie, so that movie becomes kind of too much theatrical.Everybody, from director to actors failed, but still, I personally bealive that the biggest failure is Peter Buchman, screenwriter.
But it's still hard over look many of the mistakes here, so I can't give it a rating higher than a 2.
Featuring a hysterical leading performance by a sixth rate actress, below budget effects you could probably recreate at home with some ketchup and a running time of just over an hour which still feels like an eternity, it all adds up to a real waste of time you watch at your own risk.
Although just over an hour long, this amateurish home-invasion exploitationer is still rather tedious stuff, being extremely slow and very predictable.
I'm still wondering why "Axe (a.k.a.
I guess we have institutions like The Daily Mail to thank for this film; not for the making of it, but rather for the fact that it still has audience when it should have been forgotten along with most of the rest of the Last House on the Left rip-off's almost thirty years ago.
But it still could be completely without interest (and run longer), so spending the hour with this odd example of the seventies B cinema didn't just go in vain as it could have!
Even though the TV show manages to make us laugh at the same things over and over, it still has variety to it, and each season kicks ass (even season 6, which a lot of people dislike).
Louise Randall Pierson went from a childhood of privilege to almost poverty after her father died when she was still a girl.
The debut of one of the most hilariously inept monster creatures ever spawned still awaits you.
Even considering that "Kiss Daddy Goodnight" was made twenty years ago, it still seemed more like a college film student effort.
In this pivotal point in the history of The Walt Disney Company, where its relationship with Pixar is still on the rocks while a new president is stepping up, I wanted this movie to be a smashing success.
It seems they think they know what makes a successful movie, over-riding many decisions of the animators and storytellers--those who are still at Feature Animation--who have proved they can make great movies.
In Disney's quest to prove that they are still the Best of the Best, movies like this will prove to the world that they are merely the best of the rest.
Kyanka, his vacant expression and breathless surfer dude delivery still intact, reveals the Promised One to be a Zen master virtual-reality gamer.
Cannibal Holocaust still rules.
I'm not sure he even had anything to do with it despite still being listed in the credits here.
The acting was bad, the script was bad, the story was bad, the gore was disgusting (but still bad), and the cannibals take the cake as being the worst looking I have ever seen.
I still love the Flintstones cartoon.
If you were or still are a fan of the Hanna-Barbera cartoon, this movie probably isn't for you.
Not all people who loved the cartoon show would bother with this, but it is still quite fun for the family.
Steve James is not his usual fantastic self, he looked very bored here, and gave a mediocre performance (Not his fault), and had no chemistry with David Bradley!, still he was able to keep this movie barely bearable with his presence.
The ninjas scamper, still in full ninja attire, across an open field.
PS: Three days after seeing it, I still couldn't stop laughing...
There are some nice atmospheric scenes and the ladies are pretty easy on the eye, but this is still not reason enough to recommend this lacklustre effort.
There's a certain charm to what Naschy does, and I'd still pick it over some Jess Franco projects, but on the other hand it sucks pretty bad.He just can't really make movies.But I do respect how me made it fairly big with little talent.
I have begun to even avoid its commercials because I still am astonished how its been on TV so long.
Even the person who knew about the "killer piranhas" still decided to go into the lake.
For example: M.Bison is a Blondie and not even a menacing one - i still wonder who has been hired as the casting director of that crappy movie.
The "plot" is so lame I can't even begin to describe it's lameness, the acting sucks like a Volta (especially the cops, God, it still gives me nightmares!
Yes and No...Yes because there was better acting and no because it's 2009 and they still can't seem to get it right.
I still think one of the best scenes in South Park was when Mrs Crabtree screamed at Pauly Shore and made him pee his pants.
), but he still made comedies that were modest hits.
Both comedians contemplate about how they made the same kinds of movie, played the same kinds of stupid people, yet Sandler is still a high commodity and Shore isn't.
Although some people loved Sandler during his "Billy Madison" and "Happy Gilmore" days and hate him now, Sandler's still famous because he grew up.
You know, I don't even hate Pauly Shore nearly as much as many other people seem to, and it's still hard to remain objective during the course of this movie and actually judge it for what it's worth.
Son in Law: Certainly no Encino Man, but still some funny moments.
If it had stopped there, there would still be a few remaining strands of credibility left, but, unfortunately, he had to pull an arrogant and pretentious stunt by making Pauly Shore is Dead.
Other than the aforementioned actors comic relief turns in this flick, the delightful eye-candy that is the luscious Anna Friel and an uneven soundtrack with a small handful of classic 70's rock ditties that still make me want to hold up a lighter even to this day I just can't bring myself to say that "Sunset Strip" is much of a movie, and certainly not one that comes highly recommended to anyone!
However though, I'm still an unabashed and devout sucker for flicks from and or set (which is this one's case) in the 1970's no matter how poorly made, overlong, demented, disjointed, incoherent, lame etc.
The story is given every conceivable, foreseeable twist and turn - a romance with the sex bar proprietor who just had to sample her talent on the sly; her friends who are dying to be let in on the particulars, but still are too prudish not to turn their backs on her; her son finding out and flying into a rage, and the reconciliation with her hostile daughter-in-law when she learns about Maggie's sacrifice - all predictable, but still: I liked it.
Marianne Faithful's slow, slightly hazy style is recognizable still, and I'd say she carries this film through in a very touching way - no pun intended.
It is as though the writer came up with what he thought was a good idea, and then after writing a few pages realised that in fact he still had writer's block.
I can still hear the voice of the Academy Award-caliber actress Monique Gabrielle, in her "if you can call it that" costume, plaintively calling, "Stalker?
But still, nothing too wrong with that, I suppose.
Part of the fun still comes from unintentional events, like scenes starting and ending abruptly, a chase-scene on horses were people just seem to be riding the same part of the road endlessly, stock footage from the first DEATHSTALKER (with a different look, easy to spot) inserted in this sequel for pointless reasons, etc.
Those bloopers are likely to kill off any braincells one might still have after viewing DEATHSTALKER II: DUAL OF THE TITANS!
I'm a big fan of the Italian thriller known as the Giallo and while I went into this film knowing that it is not a Giallo; I was still hoping that director Luigi Comencini would be able to make the film interesting enough to at least be entertaining.
Pete still has both legs in this one.
Renee Zellweger shone far above the rest of the cast, Chris O'Donnell still needs to work on his comic timing, and the entire plot was an insult to women.
Conclusion Statement: Half way through "The Bachelor" I still did not know the character's names.
A Jerry Lewis vehicle that delivers exactly what his fans want while pleasing no one still hoping for a surprise from the comedic actor.
I still get the feeling that there is something not quite right about it, but who can be sure?
There is no way in the world she would still be this uninformed, inexperienced, and helpless.
Or is it something still more disturbing?
I still liked 'Go,' in which Polley completely steals the entire movie from Katie Holmes.
Now if you can ignore the silly and racially insensitive casting, you still probably will hate the film because of the horrible writing.
While still chilling and ambitious, he is also sympathetic and loves his wife to death.
Then halfway through, he comes back, and still he has no purpose.
He still leaves the phone and dust covered with a blanket though!!
In the meantime, a specialist group of army technicians and possibly doctors (it's not clear) come to the house, question the sole occupant and take away a sample, for analysis, of the dust that is still just sitting there under the blanket.
They board up the house, with him still inside, and gas it inside a chemical control tent.
Regarding Batgirl, I was not exactly happy that she was in costume only briefly, but as Barbara Gordon, she was great as a damsel in distress, but still able to take care of herself, just like in the Heart of Steel 2 part episode.
I am still waiting to see a story from Louis XVI, which is worth seeing.
Hell, even during the still shots, the camera-work is pathetic.
If you still wish to see this movie, however, just fast forward to the Brittania dance-sequence.
For a reason that I do now know, the last 1/5 of the movie got slightly better, but it was still way below mediocre film making.
Actually...I still do.
In the end, I still love the show.
But honestly, this movie was crap, and I'm pretty sure it was just made by Matt and Dave to see how much random crap they could pull and still get your 10 bucks (the most genius part of the film).
Even though I didn't smoke pot, I still felt like I did about half-way through the blathering non-existent plot, stop and notice the insanity and ask yourself what's going on as you see two people leaving the theater movie.
They then could have added the radio station and maybe some people trapped in their houses and even some still on the street.
By the 80's they had the formula of it down, but back in the 70's they were still working it out and a lot of them failed.
A good "war is hell" movie still suitable for younger viewers due to its lack of gratuitous gore, and a memorable portrayal of ordinary people facing up to the bold task of confronting tyranny.
You know you're in trouble when you're watching a Jackie Chan movie & 20 minutes in there still isn't a fight.
With great martial arts/HK flicks like HERO & KUNG FU MASTER (the epic starring Donnie Yen) still without wide US distribution I am afraid this may already be happening.
City hunter will entertain let's say 3 to 8 year olds who are not so bright and it makes one wonder how this scrap made it on DVD while a genuine masterpiece like "The fearless vampire killers" is still waiting for a DVD release.
While the brown and yellow Romeo and Juliet seals (to distinguish between the Montague and Capulet herds) are closer to the look of Casper the Ghost and friends than the more detailed "flat" animation from the corporate giants at Disney, Pixar or Bluth, it is several steps ahead of the still popular (among the undemanding young) work associated with Rankin-Bass.
The idea... Maybe, but no, still not good enough.
Then there are stupid movies, and some are still okay, as there are some chuckles along the way and likable characters.
But then, this movie is not about them, but 2 middle-aged men who have been coddled by their parents and not only still live at home, are waited on hand and foot.
The plot is about these losers who still live at home, unemployed 40-year-olds who live with their mother and father they meet and they develop a relationship and get married Ferrel and Reilly hate each other and Ferrel does the worst thing in any comedy movie (besides Charlies Angels 2 with hiring those writers(even though writers isn't a word to describe them) he puts his balls on Reilly's drum set (no wonder earlier in this piece of crap he said "Don't touch my drum set") and then they find out they have more in common and they decide to start a new music band (REPLACE THE DRUM SET) and then Ferrels younger brother is in town this guy is a success with a love relationship Ferrel says he's an ###hole and the brother sells their house and they try to get it back by doing the unthinkable like dressing up as Natzi's and putting makeup on Ferrel's face trying to make out he's dead (if only it was real) and later Ferrel's younger brother runs out of people to sell it to and one night they release their first music video see they wanted to be in this band with 2 people the step-brothers and Reilly's father owns a boat and that's where they were filming it while it was in the water with nobody driving it.
Do you still think jokes about penises and masturbating are hilarious?
It's pathetic, and all it really does is make you embarrassed to still be watching this movie.
Ferrell plays an even bigger dumber lout than usual, still mistaking screaming for comedy.
Seth Rogen shows up for a cameo scene to remind us how people can seem like real characters and still be funny.
Since Brennan and Dale still live with their parents (even having 40 years old), they need to live as step brothers.
The movie follows Dale (Reilly) and Brennan (Ferrell), two single, unemployable 40 year old losers who still live at home with their single parents (played by Mary Steenburgen and Richard Jenkins, two very good actors that don't have much to work with).
I think the reason there's no cross-cutting is that there's no content - some lawyer clearly wouldn't let them talk about Moog's battles with the company that bears his name (don't ask me for more detail), and all that's left is a sequence of short arbitrary rambles - still life with Gershon Kingsley, still life with DJ Spooky (who is a pompous ass), Moog picking bell peppers, et cetera, plus some wan recitations of the word 'spirituality.'
I can still remember the cinema, the seat, the friends I first saw this film with - myself British and a friend Ausralian, both weeping with laughter as we recognised ourselves in that gawky Scottish lad, and his hilarious younger sister.
I have seen the movie Knight Rider 2010 and do agree that it is not the best.in fact,it is extremely poorly produced.However-I think Tug 3 should get his facts right.James Doohan is in Knight Rider 2000,and not Knight Rider 2010.Dont' roll over my leg KITT!In any event the original is a great show which,although very eighties,still carries enough punch to make the grade.Reading about how some of the stunt work was done makes the big budget shows of today a bit naff.some of KN might seem a bit cheesy,but then again,some cheeses have a great flavour.and if super pursuit don't blow your mind just see a black pontiac close up-KITT is timeless.cue purple sunset
I've grown up with it and still find something to smile about every time, much the same way that I do when listening to Jonathan Richman's mid-80's albums Rockin and Romance and Jonathan Sings.
The TV movie before 2010; KR2000 was crud but it at least had some relevance to the 80's series, Team Knight Rider was also terrible but still had ties to KITT and The Foundation.
It wasn't improved by the fact I was in a bad mood when I watched it, but still, they could have done much better than this.
Still, as Season Two comes to a close, this beats a lot of other trash which surfaced during the course of the Season Two, but it's still pretty rubbish and is one of many X-Files episodes I wouldn't watch again if you paid me.
Khaila Richards has discovered that the baby she left in a cardboard box is still alive and lays claim to him, stating that he should not be raised by parents of a differing colour.
It still feels funny and true after almost thirty years.
People like this exploit grieving families who are so desperate to believe that their loved one is still with them somehow, that they blindly swallow the info that he "tells" them, never questioning the fact that he does NOTHING!
However, at times these films were still very rough and not especially memorable.
No, Chaplin as the cute Little Tramp was still evolving.
Her friend, Geraldine Ferraro, finally believes her, but still has no problem leaving her alone (while drugged!)
I still have no idea.
Worse still, her brotherÂthe killerÂnow seems to have a psychic connection with Beth, knows that his lil' sis is back 'home', and wants to finish the job he started 14 years ago.
Okay, what makes a slasher is in it, some nudity and first person shots but still it is missing suspense.
But even if he has made money in his life, his messages are still important in that they expose, more than any other source, the failing of our nation whether by chance or design.
It is just so gentle and laid-back that it won me over almost immediately, and even with the weak finish, it's still one of the finest British comedies that I have ever seen.
Suburbs are happy, filled with black loving grandma's who feel safe all the time - towns where the infrastructure is ruined are still okay because the American dream lives on in a boy who makes coffee.
Okay, so that's ridiculous, but still, this filmmaker is suggesting that Moore owes it to the NRA or Charlton Heston that his film also includes all the nice things he said at his NRA speech?
Needless to say even with those effective moments the film is still crap.
is still in his 20's & therefore Weiss's story is psychically impossible.
Even though at the end of the day it's still a mess with the story all over the place.
One of their more recent releases (although the IMDb says it was made in 2003) is Jake's Booty Call, an animated comedy using two-dimensional computer animation not unlike that used in South Park, but still with the characters looking like cardboard cutouts.
This film was made in 1993 and the `horrible' creatures featuring here still look like typical 80's cheese.
Nice looking artistic girl after three years still suffering from the dead of his over-self-confident boyfriend, who was cheating on her with her best friend.
So, why are they still involved?
That still isn't enough to give this poor excuse for an episode a full point, but IMDb doesn't allow a rating lower than a one.
But I still have the dragon spear!
', followed by holding the spear up so we can see he is telling the truth and does, indeed, still have the dragon spear.
In between some scenes, we cut to a shot of the moon, perhaps to assure the viewers that there is no need to worry, it is indeed still nighttime.
I am still a Mandy Moore fan, but I think she made a mistake by making the film...but hey you live and learn.
I couldn't sit still it was a slow pace movie.
Now don't get me wrong even though I am a guy I still enjoy some chick flicks like Down to You, 10 Things I Hate About You, and Boys and Girls.
This movie may have given cinema an iconic character in its visualisation of Count Dracula Â every kid ever to do a vampire impression has used Bela Lugosi's accent Â and the film is undeniably influential, but, like Boris Karloff's creature in the same year's similarly overrated 'Frankenstein', Lugosi has very little to do besides stand still and stare a lot while someone shines a torch in his eyes.
Now if brilliant Clare Danes had been cast, this movie would still be poor, but not quite as unwatchable.
But I figured I take a chance on this film but that still didn't work.
The film still has the same effect on me 25 years later.
It tries to be powerful, but why should I care when I still don't know the names of the characters, let alone their motivations.
The scene drags on for long time, emotional soundtrack joins the scene, many perspectives are taken of the hero getting a tear - and all while the bad guys still fire at them.
I caught it from around the beginning and thought it was a Japanese movie somehow on the foreign movie channel - Japanese actors, Japanese dialog (even though the lead still had a bit of an accent).
Eventually, he gets a greatly deserved butt-kicking by a group of midgets (one of the many feeble attempts at getting a laugh), and he still doesn't get the point: nobody likes you, Alby, you need to grow up.
The most annoying thing is the fact that you can still tell Anthony Hopkins is a good actor!!
Along with "Paris, Texas" and "Until the End of the World" it still holds a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to the genius of Wim Wenders.
It ends all too suddenly and there are plenty of questions still left unanswered by the end.
Even while tinkling the ivories in the new happy ending, he still seems like a self- absorbed brooder.
I saw this film over 20 years ago and still remember it as the worst ever - without having seen it since.
I think that, in the unlikely event that someone actually PAID someone else to see this tripe, the person who was paid would still be getting the raw end of the deal.
This girl killed a god (or at least a man perceived as one) for Imhotep, and she has already been brought back to life, still she freezes in fear while our brave (and beautiful) Rachel Weizs races to the rescue.
The first picture showed that Universal movie monsters could easily be remade into big budget, special effect extravaganzas, and still be good.
Heck, you could be paying attention the whole movie and still be confused.
He's one of those characters that is scared to death from anything and everything, and still quips out the bad jokes.
They've got that really rebellious "I'm REAL punk rock & I'm not a poseur & you ARE & the rest of the world sux" thing from high school still going pretty strong.
I know Joe Karlosi (if he's still around, that is) won't be too pleased with my review of this one as I know this is one of his guilty pleasuresÂbut I have to say that my negative impressions were certainly amplified by the abysmal state (correct aspect ratio notwithstanding) of the print I watched which was replete with print damage and missing frames which not only managed to shorten the film to around 70 minutes (against the official 83!!)
Yet Jolson's dynamism as an entertainer still shines through and when he's singing you almost forget about the plot.
Now I know there were some grey areas as to which was going on in the past and which was in the present but Hardy did state that it was only 1943 inside of the sub and still very much 1981 outside... hence the reason why the Russians of 1981 were getting a little anxious at the sight of the sub on its radar... so I'm assuming that the boats they blew up were real and of 1981 too?
In short, I still like Benjamin Bratt (not that he needs an endorsement), but I did not find this to be a good film.
But they still sell on ebay for prices that range from $50 Â to as much as a staggering $120 a pop, just because they've become as rare as a teddy boy's quiff.
Worse still was the plot, which presented a nauseatingly sentimentalised picture of family life, not to mention a hopelessly unrealistic adolescent relationship.
I still think that the best-ever coming-of-age film is "Rebel without a Cause", but that is a tragic drama about situations outside most teenagers' experience.
And since teenagers are still building their personality, this is symbolized with rapid, successive changes of clothes.
In addition, even if the film was subbed and a pristine copy, it would still only perhaps merit a 5.
In the early 60s he was still producing quality work (Splendor in the Grass, America,America) when he turned to writing a best seller (The Arrangement) eventually bringing it to the screen in the late sixties.
Kerr for her part seems like she's still in rehearsal.
This stagey adaptation of a French play is fairly creaky but still provides the occasional chuckle as Frank Fay essays a double role as a husband missing with amnesia for five years.
Her reaction at finding out her friend's betrayal seems very true-to-life; her marriage may have been on the rocks, but it's still a shock to discover that he is involved with a person extremely close to you.
Not completely awful, but still I have a hard time finding the point.
Yet here, the Russians attack and virtually destroy a US nuclear carrier, we bomb a Russian airbase, and we're still standing at that brink.
The pacing is bad; one minute the bomb is still being constructed, and a few minutes later its already placed in Baltimore and about to explode, with the cliche of Ryan hot on the trail, trying to warn the President.
He doesn't do or say anything particularly funny, either, but just by being a stoned hippie and saying "dude" and "man" he still manages to be funnier than everything else.
I have to admit that the version I saw was only seventy three minutes long and may well have been a cut version; but unless they cut out all the interesting bits, this is still a bad film.
Jose Ferrer doesn't seem to be putting a whole lot into his haggard performance, however he still comes off reasonably well.
They, along with the superstitious locals (who still like to dress as if they are movie extras) live with the everyday reality of vampires.
It's uncalled for but it's still decent.
Now...still waiting for the dramatic part, or some narration explaining what his writings were all about...or SOMETHING to make us know a little bit of the greatness of this man.
Since my brain has an automated trash filter and defragger (I still run on NTFS), I only remember small pieces of the film.
So, for those of you who have read the above and ca see that i am still sitting on the fence regarding this film.
If you can still find it, read the novelization and consider what this film could have been.
Not because he's a relentless one-man killing squad, of course, but because he's the living proof that you can still chase your dreams and realize your ambitions even if you're physically disabledÂ Yeah right, enough with this rubbish!
There are some good special effects, I didn't think Farrell was that bad, and even though the premise of a blind superhero is ridiculous nonsense, there is still some fun to be had.
He may have lost his walking legs, but he's still a Mack Daddy Hustla Pimp who can satisfy the ladies.
1st watched 10/18/2001 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Jack Gill): I actually expected this title to be much worse than it really was, but it still was not good enough to merit it a good rating.
A-Pix entertainment doesn't usually even come close with it's offerings but this one was closer than normal but still a grade-b movie that tries to be a little more than this but doesn't pull it off.
I still say it's better than any movie with Pauly Shore in it (I realize that's not much to live up to but still).
Obviously she didn't know yet, she was still gathering clues and thought she was going insane!!
Not to mention the confusing side crime story that I'm still attempting to decipher three hours after seeing the movie.
Or, when poor cop Josh Hartnett and socialite Hillary Swank engage in carnal relations in a seedy motel, and afterwards, as he, sitting in bed, is lighting up cigarettes for the two of them while she cuddles near him, is still wearing his fedora while she still wears her pearls.
There are still parts that I can't understand or don't see the significance.
It is however beautifully shot and lit in many scenes, but even a polished turd is still a turd, and that is essentially what you have here with DePalma's latest offering.
I was originally going to give this movie a two rating..but for two reasons only I bumped it up to a 4 (which is still bad btw) The two characters that made this movie even remotely watchable were Wes & Big Mac.
Story line = 0 Music = 0 Martin Lawrence = 10 / = still awful
It's not too high on the chick flick scale, yet it's still high enough to be watched with that special someone.
That was what made it easy to feel for the character and remember that there is still the mind of a man deep in there.
This remains to be seen as the movie is still actively shooting here.
Well I still don't know how, but it did, big time.
Even if you're looking for Catherine Zeta-Jones' butt, you're still going to be disappointed.
Here we get an endless 100 minutes of an unappealing actor trying to hide he's a psychopath (a character as supposedly smart as the woman in this movie should have been able to tell after her first conversation with him, but like the rest of the movie, she remains stone still with a concerned look on her face while he has any number of freak outs), mixed with clumsily directed murder scenes, and an ridiculously repetitive and drawn-out final twenty minutes.
I haven't seen most of the cast and crew since, but I still think about all, OK -- some, of you occasionally.
Some curious cameos are also featured here from a number of character actors that are passable considering all, though to be honest I'm still scratching my head as to why any of them would have actually made appearances in this flick in the first place; the actors I'm in reference to are: Maury Chakin, Christopher Walkin (!?
As bad as Live Wire was, it was still better than other films released in the same decade like Tango & Cash or Raw Deal.
Even though it begins to lose its puff towards the end, gladly the time still breezes by if transparently.
The hero of the movie I guess is Michael Pare, who has gotten fatter and still can't act his way out of a wet paper bag.
Sadder still is the participation of Charles Durning, who really is a good actor, but does three scenes which make absolutely no sense so they can put his name on the DVD cover and trick you into thinking you are seeing a better movie.
The premise is that what we are seeing represents the thoughts in a condemned man's mind during the last two seconds that his brain still functions, as he dies in the electric chair.
This original operetta was a flop in 1930 and still is, despite good production values (no surprise, with Goldwyn as producer) a shimmering leading lady (Evelyn Laye) and a fun supporting turn by Lilyan Tashman.
The original "Pet Seamatary" of 1989 (also directed by Lambert) was certainly no Horror-highlight, and I personally found it to be overrated by many of my fellow Horror fans, but it was still an atmospheric and entertaining film that had many creepy moments.
I will say the last scene in the movie is the most brutal I have ever viewed and say I am still wondering if that whole scene was performed on an actual human being.
It may have been carried by some reasonable acting, but if the word had been defined by the standard in this movie then I think actors would still be waiting tables as it bought in a higher salary.
But still, even though the idea was great in the end it was the ham fisted execution of the concept that will probably make any self respecting movie go-er recoil in horror the most.
The script by Keith Leopard is pretty faithful to Browning's original but with several changes, the basic story of a 'normal' person trying to exploit the freaks by marrying into their number is still present & correct but it's the character's which are the main difference.
That's probably unfair, she's not bad and does bring a sense of panache to the role, but she raises a problem--why would the main character still be interested in his co-worker after getting a gander at Ms. Hurley's cleavage?
From Ellyn Bache's novel about the feisty mother of seven boys, most of whom are now grown and out of the house, still worrying after them, concerned over their health and safety, which eventually puts a strain on her sanity.
This is not a wonderful movie, but still very enjoyable.
But still, it had it's moments and was watchable.
I shouldn't have expected more from a movie that has a little kid being chopped in half and still talking, with his legs just standing there.
Everything is innocent (they go to an opera) till they are robbed and madame Kinski begs him to stay the night with her as she's still dead afraid.
For anyone who still disagrees, let me put it this way.
After the horrid reviews, I had low expectations but still -this movie is so predictable, so false, so by the numbers that it just unfolds because it has to.
This movie was encouraged to be filmed at the time because Irwin Allen still had one film left on his contract to be directed and the film studio wanted to get their money's worth while they could.
Director Cliff Owen wisely makes the most of Berova's awesome physical attributes to try and distract his audience, having her slip into clingy white robes that give viewers a tantalising glimpse of her marvellous milky puddings (please note: my workmate Phil wanted me to use that phrase in one of my comments), but even with endless gratuitous lingering shots of her semi-clad form, the film still winds up as something of a snooze-fest.
However, it was still worth a look to see Lupe Valez.
The 'princess Sophia' nickname is still one of the best nicknames I already heard for a guy's part.
Also, this director has a great cast of actors and yet they still end up sucking (though I personally don't blame the actors, I blame the director).
Matthew did a good job i guess, but i still don't particularly like him a lot.
Thank God Americans still have some semblance of good taste and sent this abomination packing.
I had a crush on Michelle Yeoh, I am still a big fan and tries to catch every film that she's in.
And I still think that I'm right, by the way.
But still, if you've seen everything else already and if you're in the mood for some charming and typically cute Sci-Fi, you won't regret choosing this movie.
The Brooks gag formulas are definitely still there, but seem lazily inserted as dependable fallback material, rather than inspired stylistic substance.
Young Frankenstein still holds up after 30 years.

So  far, the Spanish still deliver the best Euro-horror so far.
It is possible for a cheesy movie to still be good.
Satan is still present in the house and he terrorizes everyone who dares to enter the mansion...Pretty dumb of course but some of the aspects that are related to Satan ( like playing the violin -- symphony of the dead ) prove that some tiny elements in this movie show potential.
I still cannot believe this movie was actually about my aunt's case.
If MST3k was still going, this would be one of their targets.
So incoherent was it that I declined to watch the whole thing and instead wasted still more time watching "Shadows of the Dead" so if you like you can read my review on that hunk-o-junk too.
Noonan is a little more restrained than usual, although he still seems very hammy because his role is in such stark contrast to the rest of the cast.
She owns all the toilet paper still, and charges him a million twist ties per roll.
Rent first  I saw this years ago in the theater when it came out upon release and my first impression still stands.
I won't say it was a huge disappointment, as I wasn't expecting much, I still found it to be plodding and boring.
Even with this added bonus I still found myself checking to see how much time was left in each of these 30 minute episodes.
I can still watch the movie and laugh out loud.
But then I still went ahead to watch, and i was wrong.
There is no plot line, no events that will lead them to even change their views of each other at this point of time(half the movie gone)and seriously, there are such little chemistry or sexual tension between the two leads that I for one, even though knowing that this is to come, still can't quite imagine them falling for each other.
(Not quite as funny as the "I'm a lesbian but I guess I'll stop it" line from EVIL COME, EVIL GO, but still...) Though watchable for the most part, it's by no means a great film and the annoying non-ending will leave a bad taste in your mouth.
While there are still some funny gags typical of Tex Avery (such as when Bugs' various body parts quickly disconnect when he gets scared), the Fetchit character's presence makes the whole thing uncomfortable, especially during the final sequence when he's challenged to a crap game.
Even if this film had NOT been banned by Time-Warner, it would still be very skipable, as it's far from the best material from the era.
Naturally all previously released versions pale in comparison, but that still doesn't mean they aren't interesting to watch.
This movie is timeless, in so much as there are still women killed by their husbands in such a violent manner, that it begs one to question the existence of a "civilized" society.
I am still pondering, however, the fact that Amy had quite a growth spurt and the rest of the family stayed physically the same.
The aliens can be clearly seen still standing around, alive and well, yet for some strange reason the family and Stockwell think they will all be safe from that point on.
She still denies that her son is capable of murder.
The reason is presumably that this detail was plagiarised from the life of Lana Turner, whose boyfriend Johnny Stompanato was indeed killed by her daughter Cheryl in self defence, and as Lana was still alive in 1987 too much attention to the incident could have resulted in a writ from her lawyers.
The rest you don't really care about as we hear about this one loves that one, but that one loves the other, who loves still another.
The shades are always closed, but warm, golden, late summer sunlight filters through, suggesting that it would be a wonderful place to either visit or, better still, to grow old in.

A minor film, given the talents of Rathbone and Neill, and a million miles removed from Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic hero, but still a pleasant enough way to kill an hour.
But that bang is still not loud enough to make you forget all the illogical and dishonest tricks the story plays on the viewer.
Not only could a child still in the womb predict the outcome of this movie after only watching 10 minutes but the last half of the movie was just one big gun scene.
But it still hasn't.
The producers tracked down everyone they could find who had worked on the film, such as Harry Thomas, the makeup genius who tells the story of how he made up Tor Johnson; the lovely Maila Nurmi, still lovely, very well spoken and extremely intelligent; and Conrad Brooks, who played a cop in the original Wood film.
In the final tally, it's still an average SciFi channel small budget movie.
I cannot understand the nerve this guy has in preaching to us his "truths" .., I still cannot believe that the very same people that build the Socialist Republic of Romania, still think they can teach us something, to us the people that made the '89 revolution, we the young, the generation that pushed this ass-pit of a country towards NATO membership and EU.
I still can't believe that Nastassja Kinski agreed to be a part of this.
The show is still a tiny bit addictive, but it just doesn't have the same appeal to me it once had.

He exclaims, "The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike, the devil will come!"
Generally, the performances were almost there, but not quite (although i still found Seth Green entertaining).
It is fascinating that studio heads were still giving her "leading roles" -- but then, once you hear the lines she had to say, you'll come to the conclusion that she must've owed somebody something, because this film is absolutely atrocious.
I really wanted more from it, but viewing this is kind of like having an almost flat soda and trying to tell yourself it's still good.
She never got a specific Oscar, although she did get nominated for her best recalled role of the villain Phyllis in DOUBLE INDEMNITY (still the champion icy killer of that period).
(Adjusting for inflation this still isn't much.)
BY BARBRA WALTERS   Unfortunately, many have forgotten and still countless others have never known how Ms. Fonda betrayed not only the idea of our country, but specific men who served and sacrificed during Vietnam   The first part of this is from an F-4E pilot   The pilot's name is Jerry Driscoll, a River Rat.

Is there still life on the Silent Planet?
This made the film a bit of a letdown towards the end, but still, I have seen worse sci-fi films and the dubbing was actually pretty good.

Edward Dmytryk returned from the McCarthy hearings to direct this slightly expanded stage show of eight World War Two soldiers, sitting around in a wrecked basement, waiting for their chance to go on furlough .... but the sergeant --- played by a Lee Marvin so young that he still has dark hair -- wants to go out and find a missing man.
still good though), and there weren't any bad performances!
Okay first i want to say even if i'm a Turk i don't like these type of movies but still i wanted to say a few things.The first movie 'DÃ¼nyayÄ± Kurtaran Adam' was a total disaster everyone in Turkey makes fun of it because it was made seriously as a sci-fi movie and they stole many things from Star Wars.But the second movie is a comedy.Now the MOST important thing in a world class comedy film is to make EVERYONE on the planet laugh,but it doesn't mean that you have to make everyone laugh to make an ordinary comedy movie,i read that one commenter said that its not even close to funny,now i'm from turkey and believe me there are MANY European and American movies people from here don't laugh at and there are many movies you people don't laugh at,this films aim is Turkish population because Turkish sense of humor isn't same with the others,actually EVERY countries sense of humor is different with other countries so MY OPINION is that it doesn't make sense to say 'not even close to funny' to a 'comedy' movie that isn't in your country because it may not suit your sense of humor but people here liked it not very much but still they liked it,so please make your comments on comedy movies according to these things..i'm sorry if my English was bad..
So I decided to give it another go some almost 20 years later... and its still one of the most disturbing animations I've ever seen (and I've seen quite a few!).
Although the technocobblers did get dulled down the second half it was still rife with it.
Another problem is that the film lacks purpose; the tapes of the title seem quite irrelevant, and although the confused ending is in some sense superior to the glossy "perfection" at the conclusion of movies like "Ocean's Eleven", the viewer is still left asking "so what?".
Although, it still wouldn't have been good.
Worse still, filler at least used to be action material, but here most of it is Soap Opera, recurring diversions into the Private Emotional Relationships of the two detectives, the hero and his wife, the hero-plus-wife and the victim's three children (who, as per tradition, they take in to raise as their own), while the advertising sets us up for cop action.
maybe seeing the remake first clouded my judgement a little even so its still crap, over all my rating is 1 out 10 and that is purely cause there is no Zero score.
And how did the crime lord get the news that they stole the gold while they were still making their get-away (cellphone?)?

I'm a huge Beatles fan...But I still have to be honest.
Lucky McKee's long-awaited (at least by me) new film is perhaps slightly disappointing when compared to his debut "May" and the exquisite Masters of Horror episode "Sick Girl", but it's still a spooky supernatural chiller and easily one of the most stylish genre-efforts released during the last five years.
Brian Epstein, their manager and mentor, was dead, and this film - their first movie project without Epstein's guiding hand or Richard Lester behind the camera - was thrashed mercilessly by the critics, and this clearly still rankles with Paul McCartney decades later.

I'm still not sure what was going on in that school, but I know how it felt to watch it, and I found this movie riveting.
While the l951 original still fascinates with its powerful acting, script, production and that fabulous Bernard Hermann's musical score, this new take features a shockingly inept cast and grade-Z special effects.

SPOILERS FOLLOW   In the original the scenes of the Earth standing still occurred at a point in the story line that made sense in the flow of the story.
The movie was moving slow but still holding my attention.
not as intricately paced as May but still a good film....i do have to correct IMDb on their error comment dealing with the lesley gore song mention....in the film, the dj clearly says, 'you first heard her at the ripe old age of 17 with the #1 hit, It's My party, Heres lesley gore' and then it goes into "you don't own me'.
7) The final scenes completely missed out on the dramas of the "standing still" time and the alien departure.

Would not recommend letting children watch a movie that, despite it's unbelievable Harlequin plot line, still could implicitly condone maladaptive behavior.
This kind of thing happens in the story: They go into some underground tunnels beneath a graveyard with no plan, no guns, no secret charm, just Don Knotts and Mr. French going to see if the monster that killed 4 people last night is still there.
You're probably thinking,"Oh well, it's unbelievable, but it's still great fun to watch, right?".....WRONG!!!!!!

Spaghetti Western regular Aldo Sambrell is curious casting for the unsympathetic vengeful head of the family and his sluttish wife (whose spirit possesses the teenage lead) is not all that attractive either (which did not prevent her from getting it on with the novice while still alive)!

Based on a novel by Daniel Carney, "The Wild Geese" presents Col. Faulkner (Richard Burton), a hard-drinking soldier of fortune still shaking off the pain from losing good-guy African leader Julius Limbani (Winston Ntshona) to a cruel dictator years ago.

The leading character is a young man named Singer, performed by Allan Arkin, who is still going strong forty years on.
Many of my generation still regret the demise of the traditional Hollywood B movie made by major studios with high production values; and intended primarily for late night showings, or drive in theatres, where a simple linear story line was all that was required for audiences who just wanted to relax.
The same sequence reappears twice later, first as the source of still photographs (the existence of which had been indicated by instantaneously superimposing rectangular frame lines on the screen during this introductory sequence), and as a videotape.
Now that's no reason to give this movie a one it could still be fun, right?
Charlie tells stories of the ranch and explains how his "world" is still there.
But spending money you don't possess still has moral connotations--and unfortunately for this movie's audience, personal ethics have no place in the propagandistic world of commercialized victim hood.

Not quite the same emotional impact (well, I knew the ending), but still a very powerful movie.
Thirty years after first seeing this movie, it still stands up, and still touches my heart in a way few movies have.
It also has its occasional 'Carry On' moments, yet, still, the bawdy pen of Talbot Rothwell would not have saved this effort.
While no where near as good as the original this long awaited sequel still manages to be a lot of fun.
In the second half, still things don't get into action, I waited, waited but it never came.
Films like Dennis Hopper's "Easy Rider" (which didn't age very well in my opinion, but still keeps a rugged charm of 60's anarchy) and Danny Boyle's "Trainspotting" portrayed those "trips" and a whole generation without ever being dull.
I'm actually close to being a Depp fan, but I'm sorry to say that I still haven't been able to keep this movie rolling to the end, or at least I can't remember an end to it.
By my standards of gore - my standards being Jackson's 'Braindead' as the godfather of gore for a zombie flick; 'The Dead Next Door' is slightly below average, but still having enough squirting blood and decapitations to keep me happy.
i first heard of the film years ago, lots of hype about it being a great little indie zombie film (i am a huge huge fan of the genre), then when i eventually got hold of a copy it was well packaged and the cover looked good......after the opening sentence i had already made up my mind that this film was complete and utter tripe but i still gave the movie a chance.
Bookwalter is still at it today, nearly twenty years later, and is just as talent deprived (ie- Ozone) as he was when this piece of trash first came out.
Selma still looks very much like it did in this movie - it is a town that takes you back in time... and it was the perfect setting for the film.
For example, there is a "zombie squad" (ha-ha) which consists only of cops who are repeatedly careless about what they do in the company of zombies and hence constantly get bitten (and turn into zombies - at least THIS zombie rule still applies).
But the acting is still totally awful.
People like this exploit grieving families who are so desperate to believe that their loved one is still with them somehow, that they blindly swallow the info that he "tells" them, never questioning the fact that he does NOTHING!
This film about reaching out and touching someone, irrespective of one's ability to verbally communicate or via signs, of one's race, color, or background, still rings true.
Kyra made even less sense, as in the beautiful long haired acrobatic girl who can apparently take care of herself, then still needs Riddick to come save her at least three times in the movie.
- after seeing it twice, I still can't figure that one out.
The movie drops you right into the middle of this mess - I suppose that it was meant to be an intriguing way to start the movie but after the first 30 minutes you'll still be scratching your head trying to figure what the heck's going on.
And even then, her character is still saddled with a name ("Aereon") that would go much better on a car.
And I still can't believe Judi Dench took part in this film.
I suspect that the director had a bunch of poorly choreographed, clunky sequences and had them edited for highlights, resulting in scenes that look more like a series of still photographs than a film.
HOWEVER, I still think it was done badly--and probably will offend people on both sides of the issue.
I can only imagine how the creators of this film pitched this and still got some idiot to pick it up.
He still hasn't forgiven me.
This film is better than Omega Code and Left Behind but was still unbelievably bad.
I still can't believe I sat through the whole movie!
To be able to give so much and yet still be denied the love and understanding of the very people you have helped so much.
Not only that, there is still a possibility that he did murder those people.
This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully.
Even a film like "Emmanuelle in prison" which is only a middling effort in the WIP genre, is still ten times better than this one.
From there, the whole thing begins to fall entirely out of control and gets worse and worse until roughly about the beach scene and beyond, which if by that point you're still paying attention and caring about where the characters are going, you're just going to be lead to one of the most antithetical climaxes in film history.
Sure, they had to cooperate to get back to Eden, er, Goya, but the snurk leader still had to bribe the "creator" to get equal treatment.

Today, I'm even more shocked that he's still on.

), but still it is missing its own point of view and especially any coherence.
None of the torpedoes hit the sub, even though no decoys are fired, and yet the sub still takes hits.
Basically this film is a very clichÃ© action film that is not in anyway stylish or well scripted but it is funny, notably the bad Russian accents and the puns, one of which had me in stitches when Dolphs sergeant is briefing him on his mission saying "have you ever heard of agent red" and Dolph replies " it sounds like a bad action movie", so at least the makers of this new they were not making a classic, overall this is not horrendous but is still pretty bad,you could quite easily stomach the full ninety minutes on a good day, if only for the hilariously cheesy dialogue but if you have a choice between this and an earlier Dolph flick theplace this nicely back on the shelf.
Dolph Lundgren does what he can with the very crappy material he is given here, however his chemistry with Meilani Paul is way off, and while he was likable, he just seemed to be going through the motions, however i still Love Lundgren , and he deserves better movies then this lousy crap!
I'm still reeling from the experience of watching this piece of garbage and I think I'm permanently brain damaged after being exposed to it.

Story line - very poor  Acting - mediocre to poor  Character Development - very little  Violence - heavy  Sex & Nudity - NONE  Tough cop Traci takes on a very bad drug dude, and in the end, she's the last cop still standing, mostly because it's her arrogance and stupidity that got the others killed.
Don't watch unless you're just currious how bad a movie can be and still make into your local video shop, the most horrible horror movie ever!!
If this was made by a first year student filmmaker it would still be a result of the grossest incompetence.
How the hell did Darren Day get any acting part - when I realised he was in it I was totally put off (if you are English you will know all that he has ever done or is famous for is poor seaside style singing and dumping girlfriends at the altar), but I still gave it a chance... And it was abysmal.. French Poirot style detective in England?
It still made me laugh just as hard as when I first watched it.
I sat watching the film knowing that it was 19 degrees outside and a magazine editor had just informed me that my review of The Pianist, which I wrote for them in November, wasn't going to be in the issue he just took to the printers and he doubted whether it would still be relevant for the next issue in May.

BUT (and this is a big BUT) the fact remains that this is still pretty awful stuff.
I still want that leather knife case!
Vincent Price looks so tired and fed up that he almost becomes pitiful.yet he still manages to ramble a funny monologue near the end.
Fellow Gothic Horror enthusiast have warned me about the film, and so did several other reviews on this great page, but as an enthusiastic fan of even the cheesier kind of Gothic Tales, who loved the other Amicus Productions, I still decided to buy it cheaply, especially since Vincent Price is my all-time favorite actor.
Even though disappointing, however, "The Monster Club" is still worth checking out for its superb cast.
Carrier based aircraft was still an unproven tactic for war, although aircraft carriers had been developed since the early twenties.
Flight Command out of necessity has to be dated, but it is still a good film to watch bearing in mind what these men were training for.
If you happen to come upon Judgement Day in a video store (unmistakeable with a cheesy green "satan" on the cover), count yourself among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still has a working copy.
the movie's slightly clever, some intriguing shots, still haven't figured out about the baby...
He then answers the door with the joint still in his mouth.
This is nothing new and yet still had potential to be something great if the writing and acting and all the elements came together but they didn't and as a result, this movie was average at best.
They all do a good acting job and I still - the next day - feel quite a bit about the film, as you can see.
I recently watched it again (I'm now 15) and I can still see why I was so afraid.
Even at the end, the sky is still dark, and you see odd creatures made of stone surrounding them.
How you can take a dramatic theme like an ongoing nuclear standoff, great actors like James Earl Jones and still end up with a giant piece of garbage so lame that calling it hackneyed melodramatic drivel is far too generous a complement.
But die-hard fans may still enjoy the commentary track.
"Purple Rose of Cairo" is a really nice change of pace for Allen, the type of film that will still challenge his audience but also give them the escapist romantic fantasy that we so yearn for when we go to the theater.
Since apparently there was no money for a set sound recordist the whole film is 'explained' in voice-over...and still it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.

Yes, we can still leave our mind at home to watch a movie but there should be some sense and element in your work.

I must fill out a few more lines to submit this, and with the videotape still in mind I now submit these lines:   nose breathing is not funny.
I was roped into this travesty because... 1) I enjoy zombie films 2) I usually enjoy both Debbie Rochon and Trent Haaga and 3) For some reason I still think there's hope out there for Full Moon, who have lost most of my respect over the years with a succession of incredibly bad releases.
If we still had book burnings as in the old days this would be a prime candidate.
With that said, there were still moments of stoner brilliance and with some quality editing and an extensive overhaul this movie may still have a chance.
Remember that this movie is still in the works and they have a chance to kick it up a notch, but I think it is unrealistic.
In this movie it looks like she is desperately trying to recreate being stoned, funny and yet still managing to be cute while clinging desperately to a mid-20 something youthfulness.
Despite the title, this isn't a horror film at all; the werewolf elements are only introduced three-quarters of the way in Â which are, in any case, merely suggested through the lead character's hallucinations Â but these obviously constitute the film's highlight (though rugged, pasty-faced star and co-director Chesebro isn't exactly Lon Chaney Jr.); still, the transformation-by-transfusion is an interesting concept, one which I don't think has been done in subsequent films.
And when moments of drama come up, they are either eluded to as still being subtly funny, or just come off as plainly amateur.
The actors within the film are clearly better trained than the material, but despite this, it still acts as a barrier limiting their every move.
He just does not seem to understand at any point during the film, and of the mere moments where he shows a brief glimpse of the actor that was born in Punch Drunk Love, they still do not seem to cut it.
Even at his worst, Walken still succeeds in being better than everything in the entirety of the movie.
Her husband, Monk (a name presumably chosen as an ironic joke), is violent, abusive and unfaithful; he is unemployed, but still manages to find enough money to drink and gamble.
Never done in film till that point, the plot is as original as it was and still is today, a sheer whimsical reverie to say the least, and is thus very entertaining, much the way you'd assume Allen Konigsborg wanted his films to function- as an imaginative escape from the hum drum banality of this world.
Having said that, it is still generally more sweet content than deep and complicated satire- in fact it's just like the popcorn that Daniels' character Tom Baxter first tastes- brittle, the stuff is sweet, and like Baxter says, 'gets annoying when you keep chewing on it'.
Few people but Woody Allen could have pulled off such an ambitious plot that still held on to its messageÂand its humor.
While a meaningfully deep comedy, Cairo is still a comedy, and a great one.
I got tired of the heavy handed approach early on, I guess, but it still kept on coming.
I still struggled to stay on, but this was only to see a hammed speech by De Niro.
The movie is just not even what I'd charitably call a 'B' movie... it is tortuously drawn out... not well written, not Hollywood-made (and if you value 'indies' above Hollywood, then this is still even below Hollywood-made)... simply sub-par.
I didn't really expect this kind of quality still existed... not in the U.S. at least?
At one point a guy is poisoned and shot but still kills a fort full of men and then carries a girl across the desert without water.
All of a sudden, he starts displaying signs of criminal behavior, and starts abusing Deanna...but still she stands by him!
I still like PokÃ©mon, and I am a die-hard fan of the games, but the TV show didn't really get me that excited.
I am still wondering why the husband left so abruptly, and then why Priscilla didn't give it a second shot.
"Yonggary" is a pretty amusing film about a big lizard from Korea named Yonggary.It's a fine example of giant monster flick that will keep most monster lovers entertained.The special effects are horrible,but they are still fun to watch.The script by Marty Poole is laughable.The acting by a bunch of unknowns is not too hot,either.The film features giant monsters,car chases,exploding jets and helicopters,spaceships and space aliens,so kids won't be disappointed.I love horror movies,but this one is surely nothing special.Avoid it,but if you have enough time to waste...4 out of 10.
As bad as the acting is, one still can't help but feel a bit sorry for the actors for having to spout out such astonishingly inane dialogue, and to portray characters that couldn't possibly be more stereotypical, in a storyline that would make the average 12 year old cringe.
Then, in the first of several changes in tone, we get annoying attempts at humour, where Jackson tries on cowboy hats in a store while still wearing his hockey mask, a cornball sequence where they go for a stroll on the beach one evening at sunset, while Jackson is still wearing his hockey mask(!)
after seeing a marquee at a local movie theatre which reads something to the effect of "Coming soon: 'Unmasked part 26'" hinting that he still will never be able to stop killing, no matter how much he may want to, because the producers will keep bringing him back again and again in more sequels.
This movie really sucks, but still itÂ´s fun to watch.
I know they weren't trying to make "Schindler's List" or anything, but still the worst family comedy since "The Shaggy Dog.'
I can still get my husband to throw things at me when I sing the first bar of that song...  
Shark Bait's cast includes R. Lee Ermey; John Rhys-Davies; Donal Logue; Rob Schneider and Freddie Prinze Jr. Love or hate any of the cast, that's still an impressive array of different personalities but judging by the animation, did they blow all the money on the cast?
THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO is a lovely, funny, and heartbreaking entry from Woody Allen that still remains one of my favorites.
An inventive film that still holds up today.
The triumph is amazing, because, despite the depth of the symbolism, PURPLE ROSE can also be seen as sheer entertainment; on its surface, it is still one of the most entertaining pictures Woody has ever made.
Did you see how still he lay on that horseback?
The two that really stood out were Sanaa Lathan and Big Boss Hogg Lance Henriksen (still going!!).
Hokey, yes... but I'm still buying it.
Yes, he is a step above Uwe Boll...but still.
If they had of just shifted the F word to the ugly mother part then there could have been just as many F words yet still kept the trademark line!
Could've saved a lot of people a lot of time and energy and money...If you've read this and still decide to rent it, you deserve what happens to you.
The movie would have us believe that someone could get away with betting that a shot could be made on a player's turn and then being able to take the next shot because the player bought his opponent's turn and therefore the subsequent shot was still his.
I also carry in my mind a (slight mis-)quote from the end of episode one which I am still waiting for Jack Bristow to say; it sort of sums up the experience so far in this show where nothing is as it seems yet everything is totally predictable - "Sydney, I'm not your father, I'm your mother".
While I do have respect for what the creators of this movie accomplished, I still hold stronger feelings towards The Blair Witch Project.
But, it's still pretty cheesy.
However, every universe, no matter how perverse or obscure, still has its rules.
It still looks like a hand-held shot which leaves me asking who is this other person helping the narrator film?
I'm sure the filmmakers wanted the perspective to be switched to "outside observer" instead of seeing events through the narrator's documentary lens, but then, shouldn't they have used a still shot or at least a mounted camera to avoid the viewer thinking that someone else is hand-holding the camera?
Rather than a switch from doc to regular film (why the heck is the picture still the same - in bad quality?)
As such, there is plenty of narration and often over still images.
For this story to work, the "interviews", video extracts, still images of exhibits and so on must all be carefully co-ordinated to ensure a clear narrative.
If you want to see a truly great fake documentary, I highly recommend GHOSTWATCH - an excellent piece of work that is carefully scripted, genuinely puts you on the edge of your seat, contains great scares and still makes you question what you've seen even when you know it's a phony.
Characters inexplicably will not keep the camera still (a really annoying scene showing this is when David Beard is filming himself in the woods towards the end and keeps revolving).
It can still occasionally to rarely be found in VHS sale racks, and was remastered for DVD.
I'm sure Kevin Costner "cared" about "Waterworld", but it was still a terrible movie.
After the credits end, there is a minute of the screen pitch black and the music still going.
It's the kind of film that has you constantly counting how many people are still alive in order to guess approximately how much running time it has left.
So, I was still a big fan when this film came out (I was even still a big fan a year later), and remember watching it over and over for a while.
however i did like the Cameo of Kimberly (pink ranger number 1) and Jason (red ranger number 1)thought it to be really cool that they still acknowledged that they were a part of this story.
Almost everything Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel have ever written has been brilliant, we'll ignore the City Slickers sequel and The Flinstones, and this is one of their early movies which, while still hilarious, somehow didn't do that well at the box-office.
The major baddie Mali...something was not threatening at all MMPR had more impressive monsters than this rubberized reject but I give it a four because of a hinted romance between Jason and Kimberly I mean who goes out with a girl solo and still be just friends plus they acted a little too friendly around each other flirting and whatnot and were hardly seen without each other and only fraternizing with each other if that doesn't say love I don't know what does.
Further still, the film ends with a cute and a tidy ending.
Polish a turd and it's still a turd.
I watched this a least three time already and is still lost.
I keep watching and watching and I'm still lost.
I'm still looking for more.
Maybe he still just likes it.
Michael Keaton just bounces off the walls as Billy Blaze, it is still to this day ,one of his most memorable turns.
Right -- my last word, if you're still reading.
It is a complete failure of a remake, and even without comparison to the original Hongkong version, it is still a ridicule of an otherwise excellent plot.
When I heard that the whole ensemble changed, I still was looking forward to the film.
a. Costello, if he is a big time gangland boss, and that he is dealing with international crime lords, why is he and his right hand man still going round the hood to collect protection money?
(They say she's in the lift; I still won't go back, as in 'go back for what'.)
Sorry, Frank, but I still have to give this one a 2 out of 10.
While not truly horrible, this movie is still a nearly unwatchable mess which is only barely saved by Zappa's music.
To many people, musician Frank Zappa's counterculture rants were dangerous, to some sexually charged and stimulating, and still to others tired and boring.
I'm a peace and love kind of guy, but right now, four hours after seeing this, I find myself still wanting to fly to LA to find Jamie Kennedy and kick his ass.
They enter a dance comp for some inane reason, but Justin's agenda is to show his ex-girl (Maria Menounos) he can still kick it, so she will leave her asshole boyfriend (Michael Rosenbaum) for him.
What almost became an Olympic sport in the 80s has been marginalized in the 2000s, but the people who still do it, do it extremely well.
Dated though it is stylistically, we appreciate the astounding expertise of the kids who can still jam, break, lock, snap, crackle and pop it.
ALL THE WAY (aka THE NIGHT WE CALLED IT A DAY) is a docudrama of sorts: it is based on a true incident that happened in Australia in 1974 and still is grumbled about today.
And there are still monster car chases and car crashes.
I still say "That Barney Rubble,..what an actor".
Some are still working out their anger issues.
Tarantino and Rodriguez are two of my favourite directors but this film still left me cold.
They had Antonio Banderas, Selma Hayek and Quentin Tarantino(hope I'm not forgetting anyone) but the movie still managed to be worse than dirt.
But still the movie is quite unfunny.
So no matter how bad this movie actually is, it's still a movie that can and most likely will make you laugh, with also some cameo's from people such as non other then Ray Charles and Hulk Hogan.
I'm still not sure how I can summarize best the story for you: Ewan McGregor plays Nick Leeson, a stock trader for England's Fairbank is given a mission in New Delhi.
It is not your typical 80's movie, although a lot of movies were (and still are) being made where this one takes place in New York City.
And, this guy is hit over the head by two lamps and a glass dish, is stabbed through the leg with a fireplace poker, with his eyes doused with floor cleaner, yet the girls still can not subdue him!
Now Chuck has to train the new man, one Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) a real `idea man' who can't sit still and never seems to quit talking, much to the chagrin of the conservative Chuck, who likes to keep things quiet and simple.
This is still a pretty bad and silly simplistic typical slasher but when being compared to the previous sequel "Slumber Party Massacre II" this movie is a step up from that one.
I've read plenty about director Ulmer being some poverty-row genius but this flick is only 70 minutes long and is still boring.
The reds are still under the beds so it's a cold war drama instead.
I just stumbled over this gem on a very independent TV station & I'm still stunned.
I mean, making an upbeat, easygoing (yet still R-rated) comedy about prostitution would seem like a crazy thing to do.
I watched this at night with a good friend who was equally unimpressed, and we still have no idea what this movie is about.
That being said, it is still, unfortunately, a Movie Americans should watch and take to heart.
It may be dated, but it is still funny after all these years.
I'm a political liberal, I hate Fox News for reasons that go beyond their political viewpoint, and I like documentaries - and still I thought this was a pretty bad movie.
After 52 minutes, when the plot was finally underway, I was still waiting for something suspenseful.
I watched it and didn't hate it, but it was rather boring and even for a drama it still was a major let down.
I am no fan of Salman Khan and while I am still willing to give Ash a chance, this film is the sort of junk that gave her a bad reputation in the first place.
It could make some point if it was released during 1995; 1996; or 1997; considering that war and Yugoslavia were still "fresh" and all... but in 2006, this movie just doesn't make sense...   Legacy of this movie is big.
But still, I'd have no problem giving it 10 had it not been for the forced ending.
Despite this it was still a good movie, entertaining, scary, creative, etc.
SPOILERS - READ WITH CAUTION  While this movie claimed to not follow any rule, there was still one big general rule that really should have been followed - as pointed out by Randy Meeks (who makes an appearance via a recording filmed before his death), at the end of a trilogy, ALL BETS ARE OFF.
If so, It would be close to the bottom of the pile...where movies you will only ever watch once and still regret doing so, live.
I bought this movie on sale and I was still robbed!
We paused the film many times to talk about what happened but still ended up finishing the movie with no clue.
But still, those 4 stars are for quality of workmanship alone, and NOT for an enjoyable film.
Both, still bitter over the difficult break-up, decide to make each other miserable by flirting with other people, inviting loud friends over, quartering the condo up into different compartments, and more.
As always Jennifer Aniston did *nada* for me -- I still don't get her appeal so I can't recommend something else she's done (sorry, you're on your own here Jen fans).
Thomas Van Hasebroeck (teasingly nicknamed Van Chickensoup) is a lifelong dreamer because he fears action and commitment after his precocious sister (Alice) is killed because of his demands that she do something that will prove she still loves him.
Even after breaking up, they still live together in their apartment because they need a place to live, and they have continuous disputes about whose room belongs to who (annoying).
You can definitely see that they are hiding their emotions behind their smiles and that they still want to be together.
But it's still a waste of time.
Jackie (Gershon) is the lead singer, who is turning 40 and still doesn't have success or a respectable recording contract.
I am still spiraling downward with Jimmy.
And many of the wonderful actors are still at it today.....nice to follow their careers.
Nevertheless, Matthau is still fine and Bruce Dern is excellent as his unexpected partner.
If I came into this film with no understanding of how the US Government screwed the Sioux out of their land (and this was the case), I still have no idea how, when, where, or why this happened.
Perhaps the most affecting moment in the movie is a closing title saying the Sioux have never to this date taken a dime for the Black Hills, implying that they're still doin' the Ghost Dance, waiting for Whitey to destroy himself (won't be long) so they can just move back in.
This was typical for the period, and is still true today.
At 57, he still has that slim body and innocent baby face that, here, doesn't camouflage Hap Holden's more than academic interest in the girls.
Langdon still is amusing in his mannerisms.
This was an excellent series and is still relevant today.
It tackled social issues such as abortion, the right to die (think of Rose) and the woman's role in society as well as racial issues, and those issues are still so relevant today.
I got in for free, went in with very minimal expectations (I expected a mobbed-up version of Space Cowboys), and still left the theater aghast at the pointlessness of this movie.
Bruce is still the greatest martial artist whom has ever lived.
First of all, let me say that I am just beginning to get my 'Italian Horror' cinema education so I'm still getting used to the unique aspects of the genre.
He went downhill fast from here but "amoung other things", he still looks good next to Alexis.
as fans stick up for it and say that haters don't understand its aims, I on the otherhand can understand its aims and the context and still think its a pile of rubbish.
It's the scene when James and Vaughn are driving slowly past a crash site as Vaughn takes pictures of various things; getting off over the blood, the death and the way the victims are trapped: the camera shots are close ups of numerous things such as the still bodies, the blood on the door and the way the pliers are applied by the firemen as they crank down and break off the metal framework blocking them from rescuing the victims Â this is not only disturbing in the sense it's supposed to be entertaining but odd that the film-makers assume that we even care about what's going on and think we will like these characters.
One particular hilarious scene involves a skater who is still spinning pirouettes on the ice as the avalanche engulfs her and the crowd (like she couldn't hear or see the avalanche coming until it was about one foot away from her?).
in the early '80's, and even though I was still kind of young, I thought it was awful.
If I remember the scene correctly, a group of people are still in either a wrecked hotel or a cave and some guys wife has just been declared dead.
Yeah, I know, admission was probably only about a quarter at best, but still, you could have had a couple sodas at the malt shop.
What surprises me is that there is no mention of the war that was still raging in 1944.
I still get chills down my spine remembering the revelation of how Rose was betrayed in season 2.
(Coincidentally, Richardson's real-life mother, Vanessa Redgrave, who has never given a bad cinematic performance, still had to struggle in the 1985 adaptation of James's 'The Bostonians'.
Never repeated on BBC television, and only the first season available on video (and long since deleted), Tenko still holds strong and popular places in the memories of its audience.
Hopkins does a decent job with his role but still doesn't manage to breathe into the production more than a flicker of life.
It has progressed with humor, but still clichÃ©.
The jury's still out on that verdict.
(Don't worry about me, I've already gone mad..) And if all that still hasn't put you off, get this.. Our muscular, tough-as-nails lead character's real, non-acting first name is.. PETER.
Susan Sarandon is still hot, I don't know why she's in this loser.
While he still gets the laughs, it's the rest of the film that fails horribly around him, It makes me wonder how many more of these films we are going to get.
To those of you still determined to watch this because you think it might offer some sexual gratification I can only say again "THERE IS NO SEX IN THIS MOVIE This film is as entertaining as athlete's foot.
I still think Wild Things is a better showcase for her talent.
A bitter revolting taste still remains in my mouth from having watched this one hour ago.
Seeing it again a few years later, it didn't feel the same but the movie is still good light entertainment.
She was so sexy and lovable in "Fear City", "Body Double", and "Something Wild", yes even in the rotten "Cherry 2000" I still loved her.
Next up, you get mild erotica with Ms. Griffith, as the still sexy older woman, wrapping her legs around Mr. Dancy, as the attractive young stud.
Well, it's been a while since the 1995 release of Wally White's ode to self-absorption "Lie Down with Dogs," and the film still ranks as the worst gay movie devoted to celluloid, and an atrocity on all levels.
No horrorfan can just sit back and enjoy EDT2, it is a disgrace to the genre...after 1 hour and 28 minutes you see one or two better scenes (breaking the arm is one of them, but still not impressive), and that's about it I'm affraid.
Rating: 2/10, and only that good because Moment By Moment still exists.
Of course, amongst their prime suspects are two veteran squatters, who still stay at a formerly occupied tenement-house.
The story is flawed, but it's still interesting, the performances are great, and the visuals are kinda cool but nothing outstanding.
At the time, it represented some kind of point of no return for bad taste movies, and could still hold its own today.
I understand the quote on all the billboards and things now... 'No one knew his name, they still don't'.
(where the film was made) No doubt still laughing their way to the bank because suckers like me rent this drivel.
i wasn't too impressed with this movie.it is in the style of both the Conan movies,but i didn't like it anywhere near as much.there was lots of action,but i still found it to be slow and boring.it becomes a bit more interesting from the halfway point on,but barely.i didn't find the acting very good,although Kevin Sorbo was good as the title character.but it was Tia Carrere who i thought was very impressive as the evil Queen.however,the only real reason i stuck it out was i noticed that the beginning credits listed Harvey Fierstein in the movie.he doesn't show up until about halfway through,but i liked him in his role.otherwise,the movie is tedious and very hard to get through.for me,Kull the Conqueror is a 4/10.
From the cheesey rock music sound track at the opening credits you realize they are not going to give the genre any respect..and great movies like Army of Darkness..can make fun of the genre while still respecting it.
Some films are mediocre, some films are bad, but still other films are so misconceived and poorly executed that the film-makers should be embarrassed of themselves.
How can a movie be this noisy and still put me to sleep?
Yet, despite this, A New Beginning still manages to do the original no justice by being a total flop.
It doesn't do the original justice, but its still fun
it still is a major failure.
And to those IMDb-commentators who still believe that Sueton and Tacitus propaganda is true, please read a book about Nero that was published less than 20 years ago.
The movie still shows a lot of mistakes, errors and is by the way made in a really cheap style, especially the sets were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looking like some villa, the city itself looked like..well like a cheap set.
So there still is the potential for an epic biography of Nero that shows the true Nero, who was one of the best emperors who ruled Rome, despite the lies of Sueton et al.
Nero is declared emperor, although he's still perhaps only 18 or 19 years old.
Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes.
The playful toys are all still there, but they've turned gray and quiet ?
I am still scratching my head...
I still don't know what the plot was about actually.
I have never had the privilege of serving but I know men who have served and men who still do and I pray they never have to bear witness to a movie such as this.
The worst part of this film though is that the tragedy that took place in Haditha is still under investigation, it is only a few years since blood was spilled there.
Even if there is a full US withdrawal from Iraq, the insurgents will still be there.
Jessica Lange comes closest, as Big Edie, to a convincing portrayal, since she builds her character from the inside out and doesn't depend on impersonation, but still falls short because she holds back (as has always been her habit as an actress), especially in the later scenes.
you know, it's a horrible situation but still you can't take your eyes away and you want to see how bad the damage is.
If you still want to watch it, go ahead.
But it's still fun.
But regardless of all that, this is still a decently fun movie.
Here are a few examples: the woman who collapses dead at a restaurant is still clearly breathing, the newspaper that you see at the 43 minute mark looks nothing like a real paper (the font and style are all wrong) and you can see the different cut and pasted portions peeling off if you pay attention.
In all probability, it is an opportunity to put gross special effects on the screen when the Hayes board went away and the MPAA was still trying to figure itself out.
Naturally, I had seen it before, but my attention was always focused on the extremely inept (yet still revolting) gore effects.
the two start to feel that it would be better to take off with the money, they still don't know that it's been burned to a crisps by the absent-minded Malik, and leave him to flounder around in his own fantasy world.
The characters are still dull, but they're in an interesting place.
I spent money to rent it so I kept watching it for another 45 minutes...still no plot after an hour.
If you're able to get along with the acting, homemade gore, and home movie quality, there's still not much of a story or funny acting to be found.
I just don't want anyone to waste their money; if, after this, you still feel some strange curiosity to buy and watch this movie, remember that you will never have back the time spent watching this, and will hate yourself for that for the next year at least.
They are always releasing bad movies and I am surprised they still have fans.
The movie looks like its been taped by some local kids doing a homework for their drama lessons, but even if so.. it would still get F minus as a grade.
I can try to find anything positive about this movie... and still fail utterly.
Even though its obvious that Warne knew the slasher guidelines inside out, she still breaks one of the most essential traditions of the cycle.
Hope they still enjoyed themselves.
It strays so far from the original literature that I still have difficulty connecting the two in my mind.
This truly has to be the worst film ever, a bunch of five year olds would surely be able to write a better script, construct more realistic sets and props and act to a higher degree than the actors in this movie seem to have demonstrated and still be more understanding to historical accuracy!
To someone watching this movie, who has not read these works before may not be as...repulsed...by it as one who has.However, even someone with no knowledge of the texts will still not enjoy this movie.Really the only good thing about it is Sean Connery.
Granted the movie "Zardoz" was strange too, and it made no sense as well, but it had a certain style and actually seemed to work even though there are still parts of it I have no clue as to what they were about.
but ill still rate it a worth watching film for its effort.........u don't get to see that lot scary movies in bollywood ,u get movies with stupid fake stunts with no good plot.
Basically Dennis Mitchell (Liar Liar's Justin Cooper) still causes misery for old neighbour George Wilson (Toy Story's Don Rickles), his wife Martha (Betty White) likes her and keeps reminding him he's a child.
Yet they still decide to stay downstairs and have a PARTY?
Well Wes, if you still are promoting those kind of horrors then surely this will be your last appearance on the set, got it?
This time next year I hope his name would not be escaping me still....
Given all of this, I still like his stories and find the guy amazingly charismatic.
The (very blatant) references to 'Mr Vampire' and 'Nightmare on Elm Street' prove that, but it still felt like the movie was taking itself too seriously.
Again, she's made her bed here, not as completely as the two who are actively cheating, but still.
Though it looks nice and shows off some beautiful scenery, this film is slow, OVERLONG, unfocused, mostly pointless and very badly acted by everyone but maybe William Holden (still not stellar) and Victor French.
Contrary to many comments, the dissatisfaction is not about the slow pace Â we still love L'Avventura, Bergman, etc., but when there is nothing to look at in the frame, things become very boring.
I'm still bitter about an incident at the 1982 World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago, when an audience full of idiots (jaded by high-tech S/FX movies) laughed at the cardboard sets in 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari'.
I'm glad I didn't go see this at the theaters, but I'm still disappointed I paid to rent this movie.
Legion of the Dead isn't a great film that's for sure but I found it a mildly entertaining way to pass 90 odd minutes although I wouldn't be able to argue with anyone who called it crap, not as bad as I was expecting but still far from what one might call a good film.
The scenes with the "witch" still make me cringe.
The Gangster realizes that Karen and Mays still love each other and his incomprehensible envy towards them has not caused a dent in their affections, and when Mays emerges as the more human person, McDowell sinks in his own self-hatred.
Even with this kind of crucial time constraint, she still has time to do a flying ballet when she arrives on Earth (already in costume).
The all-star cast is interesting; the 18-old year Helen Slater in the title-role is wonderful; she's very beautiful when she flies with the mini-super costume and she gives to character the right mix of naivety and courage; she's the real perfect choice for the role; it is a pity that the picture's failure have run over her and have ruined her carrier still after to start.
In few scenes this enormous ham female falls in ridicule ruinously: when Dunaway prepares the spell-love potion with a spider and a walnut she's really embarrassing or when tries to seduce Etahn painfully or still in the final battle when she screams clumsily before to become feeding for the monster.
His Superman may have been human-reared, but still very much Kryptonian in his soul.
Nice... Well if you are into that sort of thing, this movie still wouldn't be anything for you.
I suppose you could also see inspector Jansen as a parody, which might make it a bit more bearable, but the storyline is still too thin to make it worth while.
Maybe I should be happy that comedies featuring black leads are no longer trying to copy 'FRIDAY'(a great film,in my opinion) yet still they're gonna have to try harder than this.
So then wait, Jones apparently had a child with someone so that they could pull a " double take" on the real bad guys, only Griffin is still bad and the U.S. cops are bad, but the undercover cops are good, but the undercover mofia as undercover cops are bad, and eventually the head moffia boss guy is also good, but only until he is bad again.
Also why do they X talent and then still send them through??
And that means networks will put on the cheapest poop they can get away with and still sell soap in the mid-west.
She was still outnumbered, and Snow White's coming back, but that's not the point.
if these people can't run with the big dogs, they need to accept it and move on.. and the judges and producers need to take an UNBIASED approach, instead of one thats tailor-made for primetime ratings, yet still dosen't deliver.
Legend has it, they're still roaming the woods.
Vote isn't for this movie, but the original team of hill and Spencer in the Trinity days, cm-on you got to admit to actually make fun of the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, and still have some good gunfighting, it was great.
No one complained when there were extreme freak rednecks in the likes of Texas chainsaw Massacre or Wrong Turn and considering I believe there are people in this country who still believe in "the banshee", fairy rings and other such insane Carroll's Irish Gift Store endorsed ideas, that it is entirely appropriate to enhance this image into that of the drooling country freak.
From the opening shot with some unknown woman writing in her journal about a mysterious man who ruined the planet or somesuch, into the overly pretentious 11 minute opening credits....... OK, I digress.. but seriously, who cares about the radio stations still working and the 2 fat guys who drive around for a while mumbling.
I went back later to try again... and still couldn't.
No...I get it, and it still sucks out loud.
Even accompanied by a liberal amount of alcohol and a very healthy suspension of disbelief I still think this is truly just an awful movie.
In this movie (I think the "brawling two" is still working here, but it's not that great as in the earlier years, decades.
But there are still good jokes, I laughed many times, it's worth a watch, but they had many better movies.
I had always been interested in watching this well-regarded British ghost story Â but was still pretty much blown away by it, being generally deemed too low-key for complete success.
I watched it with my best friend over the telephone, who is like 1,000 miles away, but we still both cried at the sweetness.
to make the most of it, meaning that when that show was *finally* put out of its misery, he still had good chances at finding a new job.
An important movie in the 'New Hollywood' movement, 'Bob & Carol...' is an engaging comedy that still might seem daring today.
That didn't upset me - I was pleased by the ending of the movie, but still surprised.
Robert Culp and Natalie Wood play a VERY liberated couple who basically love each other...when they cheat on the other they discuss it and talk out their feelings and end up still madly in love.
That aside, I still sort of like the movie.
The performances are BRILLIANT, and are still Oscar worthy.
The pay-off, it seems to me, is in the fact that at the moment when the enthusiastic couple and the reluctant couple submit to the full and unfettered concept of free love, they finally realize the truth that no matter how much love and social freedom they feel towards their dearest friends, there are still some areas of human experience that are best kept private and intimate.
it was (and remains) a brisk paced "fun, and funny" movie that still holds up in this somewhat jaded time we now live in - most viewers today would not have a clue how racy this movie was thought to be at its first showing way back in 1969.
I can still remember my wife and I discussing the movie for weeks after first viewing it - with a little bit of embarrassment but over-all just plain laughter!!
thinking back it really fun to elicit the red faces from our friends - still makes me chuckle even after all these years - thanks for the opportunity of sharing this information with those who haven't seen it - its worth much more than the price of admission.
Natalie Wood is less interesting: she's at her most beautiful here, but there's a plastic quality about her work that she can't seem to shake (perhaps she was still stuck in her star-vehicle mode, being overtly 'nutty', and this clashes with the more subtle work of her co-stars).
B&C&T&A is still entertaining and has a number of funny scenes.
Sure the clothes are different, the latest self-help fads are different, the priorities are different--but SO much still resonates today.
Ãngela Molina doesn't have the chance to shine, but still does a decent work, with what she has got.
If only one could still find a board for $25.
Although it is an old movie, it is still quite enjoyable.
While not a good double-feature match for "Rebel Without a Cause", it is dark and serious enough to still have some relevance  While presenting a rather tame portrait of California's surf and beatnik counterculture, it fits solidly with the better coming-of-age/generational revolution stuff of the 1950's and 60's.
Bharati is still running away to commit suicide.
Even 20 years later, during the day with all the lights on-it still has the same effect.
I still get goosebumps just thinking about that painting.
First shown on NBC-TV in November 1969, NIGHT GALLERY, the pilot to the 1970-73 TV anthology show of the same name, was the last major work of Rod Serling, creator of what may still rank as the best TV series ever, "The Twilight Zone."
Although Serling's moralizing sometimes gets a bit on the heavy-handed side, NIGHT GALLERY is still superbly conceived, with the case giving excellent and often chilling performances.
Roddy was undoubtedly one of the most intrinsically likable stars there ever was, so much so that he could play the most despicably evil characters and still make the character a delight.
If you ignore "some" of the flaws in the script it still comes out a pretty good psychological horror movie.
Perhaps not as belly-laughingly funny as the Full Monty, but still loads of laugh-out-loud moments and an all-round enjoyable film.
Just saw this film a couple of hours ago and thought I'd write a review while it was still fresh in my Mind.
Bill Nighy is a plus point to this film, but still doesnt get enough funny bits to do.
Subsequent excuses for the film's disastrous performance at the box-office varied from good weather putting people off going to the cinema to the revelation that the screenwriter had done time for IRA offences (subsequently overturned, but still about as endearing to the British public as Al Qaeda are to Americans).
In fact, we're still singing that crazy "Four Months at Sea" song and laughing about it.
However, it does shed light on the difficulty of maintaining a relationship while still enjoying the university lifestyle.
Albeit less than a few decades ago, but it is still happening around us...
I'm still upset about the name "National Lampoon" in the box.
This is a great first date movie or for any guy still trying to get his girl into bed.
The Save Miracles Team, even after a year has passed, is still doing what it can to save the show.
Conclusion In the end, the movie is very good, but still misses something, and that mostly is for the storytelling/development account.
Despite script holes, I still found it entertaining.
I liked it in 1991 and I still like it now 15 years later.
The mech designs are amazing (and by the way the Valkyries would work in real life if someone just put some money in to the project) and still some of the coolest ever in anime.
As I said in my title, this is still the greatest SF animated film ever made!
And still, even after all of these years, SDFM:DYRL not only holds up, but is still a force to be reckoned with.
Some Japanese directors have claimed that Japanese animation is actually more of a mix between the detailed still drawings of manga and the fluidity of traditional Western animation, thus it is an art form in and of itself being neither comic book nor cartoon.
The cloaked "phantom fighters" that made their debut in Wing Commander II would still have been in development at the time of the movie, let alone well known skipper missiles for the first movie.
Anyway, despite not being able to get my head around this aspect of The Hole that well I still think it's good entertainment, it's different, it's memorable & I liked it a fair bit.
(I can still hum the main theme to "Heart of the Tiger," some six years after I last played it, and it still sends chills down my spine.)
I feel that this movie should have gotten better reviews but i am still happy with it.
Freddie Prinze, Jr. looked like he was still shaking off the remnants of a trendy teenage mindset, but he was adequate.
It's no wonder he would still be somewhat immature.
But they still managed to make a decent SF movie.
The acting is not top-notch, but it's still pretty damn good, especially Tcheky Karyo's performance as Paladin.
In one memorable sequence, we get to see a wrecked space fighter, with its pilot still within, pushed off the runway by a futuristic bulldozer that seems to grip the tarmac using the traditional wheel arrangement.
It puts the director kid on a bed of spikes, entraps the great grandson behind bars, and does something to Lewis, but Lewis can still talk, and he tells the director kid that the only way to defeat the great grandfather's ghost is to destroy the clock.
Awww... it's Lewis... Everybody with me, Awwwww... Lewis is still alive.
Norma, distraught, tells him they have to face reality, that he'll still want to see Marian (although why he would ever want to see Marian again escapes me), and that if he marries Norma, he would shame his family, be alienated from his children, etc., etc.
It's still a good film - beautiful to look at, interesting themes intelligently developed, plenty of room given for good acting, and some very lovely music, but it just lacked the depth I was expecting.
At some points it even started to resemble a music video...  Maybe I'm being harder on this film than it deserves - it's still more worthwhile than a lot of the films I've seen over the past year - but Shinji Aoyama is capable of genius and simply doesn't deliver it here...
Are you still reading?
Don't you think that these people can still have fun?
It has a social engagement (showing that even in biggest misery, people still care for each other and help each other), that probably will never be found in a Hollywood production.
Why is my woman unhappy, do we still talk to each other?
Wow, not only is she a goddess and still looked great 10+ years after FYO, but she is a riveting actress.
The acting is up to scratch and especially moments when the captives are in the prison and they really are feeling the pain and torture and still managing to resist the urge to stop it.
I miss the old cast the further I get into the seasons, the old cast is what made the show so great I believe even without them the show is good but the old cast had the better times and the most memories.I own all 10 seasons and I am still working my way through to the end.
Then we cut back to the rest of the cast all standing still with cow-like expressions.
I am familiar with a good portion of the work of Jules Verne, as well as the astonishing and disappointing creative liberties that are so often taken with his work (it still blows my mind completely that they added a DUCK to the 1959 adaptation of Journey to the Center of the Earth), but I have not read Mysterious Island so I don't know how faithful the film is to the original story.
c) the hole is abandoned since WW II, but there still is electricity.
The one problem I have with the audit though is that the auditor questions what Mulder and Scully are still investigating if they have solved everything.
I understand that the brain surgery he had is killing him but that shouldn't affect his throat, and having to smoke through it as if he still had lung cancer.
It still comes as a big shock if you don't catch the clues.
If the joke was lame it was rendered even lamer still by the fact the camera isn't locked on the actors close enough before the joke was revealed , we knew they were sitting on a park bench long before the punch line !
I 'think' the film wains a bit towards the end, but it's still brilliant viewing!
I don't care, I still love it.
I still don't fully understand but apparently that kid Gabe knows about the collector and he can see the devil and has something to do with the redemption of the collector himself.
I saw this film in 1994 or 1995 on Canal+ and I can still remember that I was really impressed by this film.
As long as there are still so much under aged girls and women that are forced to work in this business, I think it's completely inappropriate to glamorize prostitution.
It's never clear for most events just what is meant to be "objective" and true versus what is still the potential fantasy of the storyteller.
If you like good looking women showing their breasts then this film is still not for you.
I felt it lost a point for the ending, which even though I had a feeling was coming to some extent, was still disappointing.
Over-all, it is still a great movie, which is why I wasn't willing to dock too many points for my own disappointment.
Director De La Iglesia did a great job making this film a hilarious Horror-comedy and still maintaining a dark and somehow gloomy atmosphere.
I'm still surprised at each one of his new films.
I have to say there's some good music in the film also :) I don't care if it's associated with satan, it's still good to hear metal in films like this one.
He was the least offensive of the three main characters although still a drunken crook - but he seemed less harmful.
The supporting cast includes the sprightly Joan Lorring as Lorre's loyal girlfriend; Alan Napier as Fitzgerald's estranged husband; Rosalind Ivan as a widowed dowager still in communication with her deceased husband; Arthur Shields as a stern prosecutor; and the always competent Doris Lloyd as Lorre's slovenly landlady.
The story is solidly constructed and focuses on three different characters and plot-lines that of course are all still connected to each other.
A few years later I found it on video and still really enjoyed it, especially the lurid vid cover.
I wonder if he's still married.
The dialogs went very fast and of course in French but still it was enough to cause hilarity amongst my family.
Kramer stars as Taylor a bright and head strong young woman who is still haunted by her brothers suicide and her fathers growing distance.
(and is still more inspiring than anything produced today)..the character of Stash also amazing....but Burnadette Peters with Ashtray Lopsided Hat is beyond PERFECT...this is perhaps MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIME...PLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEASE RELEASE ON DVD...Merchant/Ivory has never produced anything less than a first rate film!!!!
But this was really bad, not as bad as Epic Movie ( How CENSORED like that got made is beyond me), but still pretty bad.
The killer is a ghost, but they still killed him.
I still do the costume of horny the clown is the best iv seen in a while the music was great.
Ray Wise plays him brilliantly: he is sadistic, intimidating, funny and still has room left for rare moments of affection(?).
I still think the show mustn't get rid of the parents of these slackers.
Remember, one of the quips is that they are all (*Or most of them - still at Home)  Maybe a future episode can be written whereby all 3 of them leave Home and get a flat between themselves (Sam, Ben and Sock) eventually.
I have seen the season like 3 time already and I can still watch it.
Ben (Rick Gonzales) is not as good as the others, but still very funny.
This movie is beautifully scripted,acted and directed.The on-board surfing shots are unreal and still hold up to the test of time.Surely the best surfing and coming of age movie ever made,and quite possibly just the best movie ever!10 out of 10.
ex-Marine or not, I still do NOT WISH to try Surfing, either!!
I refuse to give up though- I still chat with a few of them, those who made it.
I know when we have a few drinks, I see the old glint in their eyes that our youth is still alive and well inside, it's just having a lie down.
This is to me the proof that Big Wednesday was and still is a masterpiece.
At the heart of this movie is this purity... and after the draft, relationships, addictions, and just plain adolescent insanity, the characters find that their friendship is still alive because of a common love.
A great feel-good movie from when movies still felt pretty good.
I mean, I know the film focused on their love, but still if you don't have the right information to play in front of the camera, other fans will dislike it.
Lombard in particular deserves a decent biopic, as her timeless, iconoclastic qualities still resonate today.
It mostly consists of Brolin and Clayburgh screaming and arguing with each other or hopping into bed...but it still works.
And the concept of a killer clown, though a bit clichÃ©, is still pretty funny.
After having seen this one now several times it still hits hard every time and probably keeps doing it.
But for now, '110th' holds its place as a forgotten landmark of Black film-making, still entertaining a limited audience.
He's still the same nice, personable guy people my age remember from 60s and 70s television.
Anthony Quinn is also excellent as a corrupt police captain who has deluded himself into believing that he still has some ethics.
Yet, she also still makes a couple of stupid decisions and all of her friends, including her horny boyfriend, are more than dim-witted enough to compensate for her cleverness.
One could easily watch this film on late-night television and never quite see the power behind Shear's camera, or Quinn's acting ability (that final scene still haunts me), or the challenging music that accompanied our visuals, but watching it on a bright and sunny Saturday, the excellence of this film comes full force.
The aging and corrupt but veteran Captain Mattelli is forced to hand over the investigation to Lieutenant Pope, who's fresh out of university and still full of ideals.
I still have a copy of "The Todd Killings" lying around, so I hope it's as masterful as this film!
The way Quinn and Franciosa interrogate doesn't leave too much room for difference, except that Quinn's subjects were still breathing after it was over.
Kotto's character is younger and still willing to keep on, but at the end of the movie, he may have another thoughts about his life, too.
Romance Sentimentale is grouped as avent-guarde with L'Age D'or (Which is still pretty disturbing nearly a century later) and Blood of the Poet but this is really avent-guadre poetry, a move from Dadaism and it's desire to shock into surrealism and a more introverted internal viewpoint.
'Couers' (which I believe, from my limited knowledge of French, means 'hearts') is a little dull compared to the English title of 'Private Fears in Public Places' which, while perhaps not perfectly relevant to the film, is still an excellent title all the same.
Finally, Algaroc was imprisoned by the King of Gods himself, but after that time, the brother and sister still despised each other, so the Children of Fire and Water forever remained apart.
At the very least, "The Hoaxters" is worth watching as a lesson in history, and also as a textbook example of propaganda techniques which are still widely used and very effective today.
Anyway when young Gene Reynolds grows up to be Robert Taylor he's now supporting dear old dad who's still drinking and gambling.
But even ignoring that, the cartoon is still quite clever (as were all the cartoons released through Warner Bros. back then).
It's a spoof of The Jazz Singer, and although seeing that film helps make the cartoon even funnier, you can still appreciate the cartoon without seeing it.
At the time, it was viewable on the Warners Brothers site but I am not sure that's still the case.
The three are in Stevens' house when the time arrives, along with the niece, her fiancÃ©e and two servants, but still they can't prevent that the killer Â known as "the Gorilla" strikes at midnight.
We find out later, but if one took the film seriously, it still would make no sense.
We never seem to know why the gorilla is targeting those who he eventually does in until the the very end of the movie which, the explanation, is so off-the-wall and confusing that when the movie is finally over your still not quite sure who the killer, or gorilla, is!
Ah well, he's still enjoyable.
It's still a horror movie and contains plenty of innovative and gory kills.
There is, in fact a "real" gorilla on the loose (played by Art Miles - the makeup, while not great, wasn't as bad as some that I've seen), who can't be the murderer (because first, gorillas can't write notes and, second, he hasn't been on the loose long enough to have committed the murders) but still he provides plenty of comic relief in his scenes with the Ritz Brothers.
Bela Lugosi does a great job here as The Butler and i wish he had more screen time!, still the film benefited a lot with his presence.
Episodes seven and eight are still lovely to look at (probably due to the nice and somehow "softer" color palette used for ep.
There still is lots going in favor of BGC, however.
Morelli isn't as accomplished a director as Meirelles, but the film is still well directed on its own more modest terms.
Thugh the new movie 'City of Men' is less specific than the TV series (judging by the DVD collections of episodes that I've seen) and suffers a bit by comparison with either it or 'City of God,' the vibrancy of the life on offer in all these films is still unmistakable, as well as the attractiveness of the young actors, the warmth of the world evoked--and vernacular swiftness that of the filming and editing, which somehow is both relaxing and unnerving.
Even though "City of Men" does not involve the same characters of "City of God", it still does incorporate the same themes of it predecessor including: friendship, loyalty, drugs, poverty, violence, and survival.
The film is still set in the favelas in Rio, but instead of focusing on the gangs as in City of God, it focuses on two 18 year old boys.
And trafficker Nefasto suddenly changing sides in the gang war; and Acerola's one-chance-in-a-million spotting trafficker Fiel still alive, and the phony solution linking Acerola's and Laranjinha's fathers in the past, etc.
The available technology had me wondering what wonders the great Jacques Cousteau could have delivered to us were he still alive and working.
(I still haven't got an answer on that question) and I was right: it was boring and annoying as hell, I was eating my nails, it was a stupid documentary.
But yet it was still interesting, light-hearted and mind blowing to see the condition of the ship itself.
Experiencing the ship firsthand and her mysteries, histories, details respected and moralities still teaching, it's a love, an awe inspiring and sad tale of Bibilical proportions.
This would have still been a fantastic documentary on the big screen even without the 3-d effect.
Even 90 years later the ship still has the power to take your breath away.
So I still watched the episodes but I thought the show got weaker with Ellen Travolta playing Charles' mother.
One thing McGoohan still does right though is the movie its humor.
Oh well, at least he still probably had lots of fun with it.
Far from being a third-rate performer, Desi Arnaz discovered innovative techniques still used in television and film production today; he also invented different types of cameras that led to great improvements in the television and motion picture industries.
It combined comedy with intense straight up action and still works today despite having its conventions replicated in a thousand films since 1982.
Sure its not as fresh and original as the first one, but its still entertaining.
The script by Jeb Stuart, John Fasano & Larry Gross is a more balanced film, it moves along at a tighter pace, the action scenes are better, it still has plenty of amusing one-liners but has thankfully dropped the racist overtones & there's just more going on.
I like them from back when they were new, so I still do.
I liked this film, and it still holds it own pretty well today for a new generation of viewers, despite the autos and clothes now starting to look a little dated.
Sure, it's not a patch on 48 hours, but it does stand as a perfect example of ne plus ultra 90s sequelitis as tougher, simpler movies are retooled into flash bang gee whizz action paintings with money flushed into entourages and re-doing the same things they did almost a decade earlier on the cheap, only this time they all actually get paid (rather than the studio running off with the money and leaving everyone to wonder why a major success still isn't in profit).
Bult Walter can still trade gunfire with anyone out there, and for that reason alone it's worthy of your attention.
Nothing seems to change in that movie, the fun factor was still there, and the comedy was there as well.
Reggie is back in prison and Jack is still a cop.
Nick and Eddie still had awesome chemistry, and the film is constantly entertaining, it's just it's nowhere close to being as good as the original, and felt they could have done a bit more new material.
Eddie Murphy is AMAZING as always, and is just plain hilarious,however both of them seemed to be going through the motions at times, still they gave it there all, and they were both great, plus Eddie gets to show off his comedic talent more!
While the script falls short of the witty dialogue you'll find in comedies like The Palm Beach Story and Bringing Up Baby, it's still a fun trip down memory lane.
(SPOILER COMING) Even when he is about to be arrested for the murder of his wife's lover, we still have to put up with 20 minutes of preaching and singing and shouting and praising the Lord before the police can finally lead him away.
Even though I had a few moments of sobriety during this particular binge, it still never occurred to me to pick the remote which was still in the same place.
Though Sonny is a murderer and a womanizer, God still chooses to use him.
I can watch this over and over and still find parts which I love.
If Disney's name was still somewhere on this one, I bet they wish they'd have taken it off by now.
But the story is still an important one, and it's worth sticking with, concluding on an upbeat, uplifting, and inspiring note.
In the most significant period of sexual liberation before the 1960s, and still in an era where plucking a bride from a primitive culture did not seem a bit dodgy, a picture like Bird of Paradise could exist.
The movie themes were in contrast to the fearful, "control-freak" reactionary ways that still exists today, & can be seen in other cultures & decades.
Quite a few things I still have not grasped from the movie, hence the need to finish the book.
But it still made a very good adaptation and a very, very good movie on it's own.
The story is complicated but somehow still easy to follow.
This was still hardly ever a problem.
Between the struggles to just see each other without Henry disappearing, to the pains of miscarriages and the possibility that they may never have children, to the knowledge of so much that will happen and trying to still believe they are making choices, the DeTambles are not your normal family by any means.
You still have to buy into the whole time travel thing, but rather than take the leap of faith scientifically with the printed version, you only need to want to see these two lovers grow old together.
The story is complicated but somehow still easy to follow.
I loved it as a child and still find it absolutely amazing now.
Still to this day I still can't stop watching it!
i would recommend this film to the girls aged around 4&10 even though i may be a little bit old for this film i still feel the same way i did for this film when i was younger.
And for the most part, I am still not.
I love this movie & often wish that my family could live where they did.I first found out about it when I was little from my mother- it's a good mother/daughter movie.I don't own it yet but will very soon so my daughter can watch it.I hope that she loves it just like I did (still do) The are some sad parts in the movie where it shows how Collins mother died & the garden was never open again.It took a little girl with a kind heart to win over her uncle-in-law in order for him to let her have the key.To me this movie says that anything is possible with love & care & that children are brilliant,not only do they learn from us but we can learn from them as well.I think that the parents that are too busy & have way too many things going on in their daily schedule need to take time out to watch this movie & do something with their children.There is a plot of land next to us here where we live that I want to make a garden out of & I want my kids to help with it (: thanks mom & to all mothers everywhere (patting myself on the back- I'm a mom too (:
Now I'm 18 and probably more cynical, so it has lost some of its magic to me, but I still like to try to get enchanted and I would urge everyone to ... well ... open his mind.
But I was looking at the five dollar bin at Wal Mart and found The Secret Garden, I figured since I hadn't seen it in a while that I could check it out once again and still I think I have a special love for this magical story about bringing life back into a dead world.
Jovovich's character adds mystery to the film, it may be gory and concentrated on violence and heavy metal music background, but it is still interesting and you will be curious as to what's going to happen.
This Movie Was Terrible to put it in 1 word.....  3 out of ten is actually quite good for this movie.....  With its complicated in depth story which never makes sense anywhere through the film to the characters terrible performance which lacks emotion within them, really makes me ashamed to say I am a fan of the game.This film doesn't have a hero to be straight,i am actually by the end glad there all being killed of because you honestly don't really care and have no reason to care what happens to them, if your still watching it by that time that is.
Sure they were still making them throughout the 90s, but we didn't really hear about them as much as we did films like Romero's 'Dead' films, the 'Return of the Living Dead' series, and so on.
When the film was announced I thought it was going to be rubbish because mostly films that are based on games are completely crap especially the ones made by Uwe Boll, but I still went to see it the first day when it came out in the UK and it was sooooo amazing.
With the release of the second installment and all the advertisement and hype Apocalypse received, it drew the mainstream fans a bit harder; the casual fans were less casual; and the fanboys were still disappointed, but resigned to the fact that this was just how it was going to be; take it or leave it.
Director has done a great job by having that videogame atmosphere by use of light, but still keeping the movie tense.
Not giving the fan-boys their favorite characters was a good choice since characters tend to get mangled in adaptation, and yet the fan-boys still complain.
The film takes place in the early 70s, when hippies were still around, and on the fringes of society.
Not incredibly violent, with Khorda's neck attacks shot in a non-offensive way, and DEATHMASTER still follows the basic vampire principles established in filmdom(..the cross effects them as does a stake through the heart)that we're accustomed to.
And it even features John Fiedler, as Pop, who wears a medallion and a hippie vest but still looks pretty much the same old geek....he who voiced 'Piglet' in the Disney movies for years.
One of them, a creepy looking dude named Barbado, seems to set off invisible wind chimes wherever he goes, it can't be his necklace, that seems to stay pretty still.
Of course, behind all this groovy mysticism Khorda is still nothing but a vampire and pretty soon so are most of the hippies in the commune.
Even though he is still a teenager, his seriousness and bravery make his a truly amazing character.
I still find it to be the greatest 80's anime of all time perfection.
Boring at moments, banal structure, but still worth to watch it!
I'm not Polish and don't speak the language, so I'm sure I miss a lot of the jokes, but on its subtitled face this movie still exerts a certain charm; it seems to be more than the sum of its parts, and left me feeling oddly elated.
Although it's more explicit than earlier Franco movies, it still contains some of his trademarks:  - Out-of-focus camera work.
After having Arthur's character seemingly make her choice, they tacked on a rather strange ambiguous ending suggesting that the "losing" husband might still have a chance.
Businessman's wife, widowed for one year before marrying her deceased husband's best friend, finds out her first husband is still alive; he was believed by the Coast Guard to have drowned after the sinking of his ship, but instead was rescued off an island.
This isn't necessarily bad--the film still earned a score of 7.
Despite this and it's talkiness, it's still a decent film with an exceptional print through most of the film--though in a few tiny spots it is scratchy and appears in need of further restoration.
The film does hold up after 80 years now, and it's still an entertaining precursor of a genre that's largely gone today.
Curiously hesitant to show much depth; still, "The Racket" exposes, while inadvertently glamorizing, the gangster lifestyle.
Turner also did a good job digitizing this, as the film quality is still high.
Minor characters still got their chances to shine in the spotlight and even the non-speaking -- well, of course all the characters were non-speaking in one sense -- the un-named characters whose job was to look menacing or even just interested in the goings-on, all stood out.
I am surprised to see how amazingly addictive this games are still to this day.
We get the same old same old from Anna Faris and Regina Hall, who I still think serves no purpose.
That said, this one (for me) falls a tad below part 3, which I thought (and still do) is the best in the bunch.
Though some jokes misfire, this is still better than part 2.
WARNING DISBELIEVERS Now i know the scary movie franchises aren't perfect but they are still the only thing i see in the cinema even close to being funny like this.
Maybe scary movie 3 lacked the split you side in a roar of laughter factor but it was still decent enough for the franchise.I hope though that the franchise ends at 5 as i don't want it to go on and start to get boring.Whenever i watch these films i cant help but kill myself laughing and really i don't know how people can find these films even the slightest bit unfunny.
As i said these films are not the perfection of its kind and they are not the most....Polite, of their genre but i still stand by that these are great films with the help of the one and only Leslie Nielson and Anna Farris with some extra help from Charlie Sheen and Bill Pullman you cant go wrong
Especially if you are a fan of film such as airplane and the naked gun movies, there are still plenty of moments in it.
The opening is rather funny with Shaq and Dr. Phil doing a "Saw" recreation and there are other celebrities who make short visits as well however it is still the same group who forms the core of the cast.
One such trip takes Cindy and her best friend Brenda into The Village, a place where time stands still and the resident blind girl (Carmen Electra) can't find the outhouse.
I went into this film a little hesitantly...How can there possibly be a fourth Scary Movie that still keeps its humour?
Although the overall structure isn't as tight as the other three, the jokes are often still 'fresh' and there's a lot of slapstick, which, although predictable, is still funny!
Anna Faris (Cindi), as always, is still on top form, as is Regina Hall (Brenda) and together, they deliver some fantastic comedy.
Worse still, there were times when it was difficult to tell what was going on.
Though I know Schumacher is an established and good director, it's still hard to forgive him for practically ruining the Batman franchise.
And though the plot (or I should say, the second portion of the movie) isn't the most original (SEE: Tales from the Crypt Presents Demon Knight) it's still entertaining and recommended for horror buffs.
(As of this writing, the IMDb listing is still "Town Creek," and not "Blood Creek.")
However, this is still a good soap opera.
Having laid out the possible flaws in this film I would still urge anyone to watch it.
The second part of the DVD picks up a little bit, but it still didn't draw me into it as much as I wished it had - Peter Coyote just appears that little bit too obvious and over-the-top in his role of the manipulating killer, and the whole connection between him and Jay Smith (Robert Loggia) never really got clear to me - yes, they were working together, but why did Loggia only have a few screen minutes if he's so essential to the plot?
Coyote especially plays his ruthless character without any self-pity, without justifications, and yet still manages to instill a great deal of humanity in him.
Everyone else, Grant, Seigner, Thomas, are put in roles that their fit well into (Grant especially as an up-tight yuppie sexually awakened/confused), but Polanski still uses them wisely from scene to scene.
Even when the sexual excitement wears off, Mimi is still in love.
I have been watching Days of Our Lives for 11 years and am still a HUGE fan.
Nevertheless, this soap opera still offers romance and a variety of story lines that cater to the genre interests of television fans.
It delivers high-quality entertainment for soap opera fans and luckily has many of the original actors that people have come to know and love (Alison Sweeney you are still my personal favorite).
It debates some moral issues, how far is it acceptable for a society still full of consevative people, such as the one performed by Hugh Grant, to acept a relationship such as that of the main characters?
While not as good as some of Polanski's other works, Bitter Moon still stands out as a highlight of his filmography and is certainly a lot better than many people have reputed it to be.
I'm saddened to see that a show that I watched from 1965-1992 and then started watching again when Steve and Matt and Mary Beth returned is still going to be so terrible.
It may not be as powerful or well made as Sunset Blvd, but it still has a great quality to it that makes it one of the better works of Vincente Minnelli.
Of course we're steered in the former direction not only by Douglas's terrific performance but also by the clever concluding scene when Sullivan, Turner and Powell, all with ample reason to have nothing do with him, still find themselves effortlessly drawn into his comeback plans.
Sullivan went on to a successful career of his own but still resents his rough handling.
Without Mr. Douglas, this would still be a good movie, but his performance raises this movie to the level of a classic.
Deirdre Hall still looks great in her 50s.
You could dress her in rags and she'll still look great.
In the next scene, still at night, the two of them reach the accident scene, where he identifies her body.
The story is better, as is the acting and direction, but still down deep this is a soap.
While it isn't quite as good, it's still an excellent film and shows what happens to people like Kirk once their star has faded.
To some it may be a close call to make but I am certain that this is still the best Hollywood-on-Hollywood film of all time.
I never miss a chance to see either film and those who are still around who were a part of it should be very proud of its enduring power.
Not especially revealing about Hollywood, which at this stage wasn't quite ready to unmask itself, but still engaging and intriguing.
The animation is cheap, though still not half as bad as shows like Pokemon.
Plus, he has an affair and still keeps his hotty bride Iole.
The riffing of Joel and the bots is still entertaining, but it can't disguise the fact this film is pretty thin on usable plot and relies mostly on Steve Reeves rugged looks to sustain itself.
In this instance, the original is still the best.
I grew up watching this stuff as a Saturday afternoon matinee 30 years ago & now, it's still as much fun to watch.
However, one look at the rugged carved from granite Steve Reeves & all her black widow tendencies fly out the window, but she still wants him for good.
And no matter what, it's still a better use of a cinema screen than "Jackass: The Movie"...
And pleasantly surprised too how good some of the women still looked, infact better than some of the Hollywood's younger women that attempt to pass themselves off as actresses.
I still got the lovely story that was beautifully acted.
The still  photos of the ladies, although they are not the originals,are very  artistic and well made.
So far the girls have raised just over Â£1 million, but there is still so much to do to fight these deadly diseases.
Although things as they stand in 2007 are no where near as bad as they have been, there are still completely wild areas in the America's (parts of Columbia are in anarchy with rebel groups still fighting a very long war).
If you watch this movie and are not moved by the story of the abuse and the archbishop's fight against it, you need to go to a doctor to see if your heart is still in your chest.
Even though I know that the Care Bears are not real... and in fact are animated- I still view them as real beings and follow their actions by caring.
That being said, and the fact that I still love the Bears as a 18-year-old, gives this fourth instalment my most solid vote of 7 after "Jetsons: The Movie" and "Hocus Pocus".
Yet I am still hoping for better to come when another movie is made.
It builds up very nicely, but I still do not get it why the doctor while drinking beer starts to bleed more and more (suicide?.
The Bassani family adjusts to Mussolini's racist laws with success at first, their father stating that despite their new limitations they can still live a reasonably secure existence.
The garden is still seductively attractive, the country around it still relatively free, but will we follow the course the Finzi-Continis took or will we come actively out of our garden while there is time?
DeSica still wanted to show the world what it was like in Italy during the darker times and even though he had a larger budget and professional actors in his films his attitude never really shifted.
So it's better to die young, when there's still time left to recover and live again".
OK, so Fear Her isn't on such a big scale as the rest of the series, but that still doesn't make it a bad episode.
I'd say this is probably one of the best episodes of the series - although, to be honest, still not even a patch on The Girl in the Fireplace, which is easily the best since the show was revived.
In a way, it's a tombstone of granite and pumice, still steaming and hot despite more than two decades of slumber.
Anyway, this isn't a masterpiece, but I still recommend it.
Only being born in the 80's I am still able to appreciate his work.
Even though this one is so-so, it still has some character.
I write this 18 years after this movie came out and she still is the hottest woman in Hollywood.
In a time when movies like Primer and The Man From Earth are showing us that great films can be made on a shoestring budget, Limbo acts as a cautionary tale that small films can still be terrible.
I still find it outstanding, being a filmmaker myself, that Ikimi managed to assemble a crew this good to produce such excellence for a meagre $9,000.
naked women, sex, huge explosions, and car chases), in order to be extremely engagingÂ "Limbo" is dead on point, and not to worry, you will still get your fix.
Here he gets to really grizzle for all his worth, his Vinson is a bitter man, blinded by hate, yet still capable of softening up if engaged in the right conversation.
Tho sadly not having a DVD release and therefore not getting a remastered work over, the current print of the film available to television networks is still a treat in this High Definition age.
I still remember moments in the movie as if I just saw it yesterday because of its gripping mature story line and deep rich character portrayals.
I still get goosebumps when I think about it.
Now, if you're still with me, picture Dracula, who only appears in about fifteen minutes of the film, with a goatee and an afro looking a lot like a youthful Al Gore, and Frankenstein's monster, who appears even less, with face that looks like an overgrown raisin with eyes.
I still don't understand why Dracula and the Frankenstein monster were even in this movie.
He and his mute assistant Groton (Lon Chaney Jr.) are still at it, murdering unsuspecting young girls for experimentation from their secret location in a House of Horrors located in an amusement park.
Overall, it may not exactly be a "good" movie, but Adamson gives it his all and delivers a movie that still has some assets and entertainment value.
Additionally, he had lost an eye and could not remember his lines, so he read from cue cards--and you could literally watch his one good eye darting back and forth while the glass one remained still.
Yeah, the budgets were tiny, the productions were unpolished, and the stories were ridiculous; nonetheless, all involved took the films very seriously, and produced something that is still being enjoyed 35 years later.
It was one of my favorites 30 years ago when I caught it on the tube, and I think it still holds up.
J. Carrol Naish and Lon Chaney Jr., both old, sick, and at the end of their careers, and having every reason to walk through their parts, perform like troupers, and lend Dracula vs. Frankenstein their significant talent, and their tarnished but still formidable charisma.
I don't know how to exlain it better than this... the acting is bad, the directing is sub standard the effects are complete crap but it's still an excellent flick.
To the remaining cast and crew that are still around if you see this comment.
The direction and visuals were fine, but still, I have never seen a more poor adaption than this.
Do they air this on TV still?
You're probably thinking,"Oh well, it's unbelievable, but it's still great fun to watch, right?".....WRONG!!!!!!
I still chuckle thinking about it.
Afterwards, our teacher said she actually likes the movie (like most people unfortunately do), but still, she told us this is NOT HOW YOU MAKE A MOVIE.
I still remember that to this day.
He doesn't even regard his victims as human beings...  His paradoxical character is in nearly every scene... McDowell captures Alex's human and inhuman side with equal skill... Alex is a victim at the mercy of an uncaring society, condemned to the physically unbearable "dislike therapy" and preyed upon by his former targets...  Set in England in the near futureÂ a future which vaguely reflects our own, but it seems that society has started to crumble and at night the streets are driven with teenage gangs who run free of parental control...  "A Clockwork Orange" is too strong for some people to accept and is still too powerful today...
The response of lawmakers who banned this critical statement on social order proved their fear by banning it almost immediately though it still managed an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and Best Director and deservedly so.
The film presents the absolute worst aspects of man, but shows that even these are still favorable to a man without the choice.
An experiment so probationary it is still being tested and held under wraps.
After the fourth time, there was little doubt in my mind, that this was the finest film ever made, and regardless of how many great masterpieces I see, A Clockwork Orange still towers above them.
Even after 34 years, this film still speaks volumes about our current culture, which many ideals are ringing true today.
There's interaction with Emily's son that could have been excised (although it serves as the source for the movie's title), and there's not quite enough interact between Hank (who's investigating, near the base) and Joan (who's still at home, a two-day drive away); true, too, that the stiff-necked bureaucrats are a little too stubborn and uncaring.
In the USA, there are still drugs, but there is on-going program of random testing, and if you do drugs you *will* get caught.
When he stepped behind the camera himself (Crash), the result was good, but still lacking something, and though In the Valley of Elah isn't perfect, it represents a huge step forward in the right direction.
And with the war still on, the theme of PTSD - Post Traumatic Stress Disorder - is topical and relevant.
The David of our hopes marched into Iraq, but the lengthening shadow of Goliath still stands before us.
Theron presents her character beautifully, surging up my hope and optimism of seeing those who do still abide by their moral conscience and make wise choices and decisions.
Deerfield soon understands, however, that it is not enough to fight your own fears in standing up to an adversary but it is necessary to treat the enemy as a human being while still doing your job.
Tommy Lee Jones gives the best performance of his long career as he plays a quiet, emotionless war vet, but still shows tremendous amount of emotion.
The film is often quiet and still, with very subtle humor.
Killing is just a job, between jobs there is constant attention (and no time for emotions), yet the enemy still strikes unexpected.
But this is not the lone hero plot line of Hollywood, it only serves to free the yakuza and show that he's still hopeless and burnt-out: he shoots himself on the road back to the woman.
He could have still retired like he wanted.
I'll still enjoy good ol' HK pistol operas, but I'll never see them quite the same again.
Beat Takeshi is a genius with this kind of stuff, he makes his gangster a real man in full 3D, hardened by a hard life but still full of uncertainty and needs, and who in the world could have outdone his deadpan but humourous face, especially in those bleak final scenes.
The theme of Sonatine is that those brutal and violent humans return to the time when they were still innocent and free of all the wickedness of the world.
Some 18 months on and I still love the film and is certainly one of my top five international films.
I have seen Kitano's latter films, Hana-bi, Brother, Tokyo Eyes & Gonin, and even though production values have improved, especially with Brother and Hana-Bi, I personally feel that Sonatine still remains Beat's best film to date.
They were caught, but Ms. Silverman's body is still not found.
Excellent, excellent work of Billy Crystal as the director of this TV film, which brought me back to the 50-60s when I was still a child.
The story is nearly exact, still in Baltimore, Maris had to face powerful pitcher Hoyt Wilhelm, whom he could not bat properly, so he failed to tie the Ruth's record in his 154th game.
Even years after, hearing Joe Buck call the short shot to the left field corner still sends chills up and down my back.
first, i was aiming to say few words about this amazing series in the forum..afterwards,i decided that such a still in made masterpiece must have the gratitude..which-believe me- it deserve.
Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs in the 1927 season, and Yankee stadium was still known, a generation later, as the house that Ruth built.
However, the press (and often, it seemed, the fans) were still favouring Mantle, and sometimes booed Maris when he would hit a home run.
We were still a borough in mourning at the loss of our beloved Dodgers in 1958 and even their rivals the Giants from Manhattan.
1 fan, and yet he still comes across in a positive light, as he should.
Then we learn that V-Day is still a few days away, then Charlie Brown goes to a school dance.
Nevertheless, it was still rather fun to watch how this train wreck of a movie would get worse.
Alas, "Mr. Monk and the Candidate" is still the show's best episode.
Season Two was still amiably enjoyable, but hardly great.
But I can still most heartily recommend Season One to anyone I meet, and most particularly recommend this fantastic episode.
While it still sacrifices some realism for the sake of suspense, it's probably one of the most realistic "hacker movies" ever made.
Even though Hitch portrays people at their most loathsome, there is still something so charming about them that you can't help but smile and forgive their all too human foibles.
Hitchcock is still with us.
That MacLaine held the screen then, and still does 50 years later (!
There is much singing and dancing and Bobby Van has a long scene where he hops through town -- even with two or three cuts, it's still a whole lot of hopping!
How even when it is illegal it still happens.
Marceline Day was excellent as Mary Phillips, so much in love with Anson, but, still putting her faith ahead of her heart.
It is very similar to "The Wedding Planner", but is still it's own movie.
I think it was the latter, as a lot of the skits had clever writing and I still laugh about them.
Despite the fact that I don't know that many answers, I still have fun playing along.
More interested in actors who are still making movies and computerized special effects, see the even sappier (and, in my opinion, horrible) 'Pearl Harbor'.
While the first movie was in my opinion great and I still watch it sometimes, the second one is a disaster!
He could've married Kirsten and I still would be happy.
10 minutes of research would've helped this film a lot, But the again the acting was so brutal, they could've used the Library of Congress and still made a horrible film.
He was still able to captivate me and take my breath away (I know corning!)
She's also studying still to become a doctor.
All the things showed here are all disappointing except for Luke who still perform a great job.
It is incredible that at this day in age, someone still supports this kind of crap.
I saw Battle in Heaven at this year's Cannes film festival, and though I had trouble sitting still and keeping my eyes on the screen, the end result was an incredibly interesting movie that experimented with new ideas, while most of the films at Cannes this year were just recycling the same ideas and techniques.
Joe plays a jingle writer who dreams of being a serious musician, even though all of his "serious" songs still sound like extended jingles, and the classical piece he composes to show off his true talent would be better suited for a group of musical saw players instead of an orchestra.
I still can't believe a film with this many fine actors could be this poor, I had a fight with woman I was dating at the time.
1978(she thought it was wonderful)haven't seen her since.This is the only reason I still remember this clunker... Other people told me not to waste money.
My guess is if anyone took a woman to this movie she probably still hates him to this day!
First of all, let me say that I am ASTONISHED that in 2008 anyone is still aware of this movie and further taking the time to comment on it on IMDb!
So here's to Joe Brooks and the rest of the cast and crew who ended a long day of shooting in the Central New York snowbanks by sharing drinks and laughs at the Caz Bar - i still have my "autographed" napkin and swizzle sticks taped into my scrapbook along with review clippings and snapshots of our Hollywood Moment together!
i can't watch this movie without becoming totally entranced and still think about my lost love often...the music is just beautiful and so moving and joe brooks is funny and charming...shelley hack is very lovely and does a great job with her winning smile and poignant tears as she says goodbye instead of goodnight in LA...  well, i'm going back East in March and we'll see if maybe one can go back again...i may even move there, since i can't seem to get him out of my heart...it's been a part of me since i was 16 and the strangest thing is the movie came out a few months after i met him in Disneyland and i flew back to Boston to see him shortly thereafter...we've been trying ever since off and on...
Here, Seinfeld and company do it rather easily, and still have plenty of room left to continue on.
But even with its off and on dialogue, the story still manages to be effective and rather clever and creative.
The animation, as wonderful and vibrant as it is, is still not up to the par Pixar is setting.
It still looks great, but it just does not attempt to overcome any barriers.
Bee Movie, even with its problems, is still a treat to watch.
We still catch up with you on reruns and buy your DVD sets and never stop laughing.
If your still thinking of watching it, think like a bee.
I was pleasantly surprised just how much of a kid I still am!
Whether it's the sidesplitting one-liners, subtle pop culture gags, or the hilarious cameos (Ray Liotta's scene was comic gold), the Master of Nothing still has the jokebug in his blood.
I read the back and knew then that it wasn't a straight up werewolf movie but it still sounded interesting so I got it.
But Binder's wit is both subtle and blatant: the dialogue makes use of every cliche imaginable, yet is still fresh and funny.
This was a very simple cartoon with some short and simple stories involving all the characters, but it was still good.
I still love it today and wish they still aired it...I suggest you find out where you can get the videos, buy them, and let your children see them...it is a very entertaining show.
They are "The Lucky Ones" , they are still alive.
Hong Kong martial arts movies were and still are made in just a few days and the storyline is rushed through as the emphasis of the movie is the action, and that's not lacking here as Norris stars as the adopted son of a casino owner who is under pressure from the local mafia.
On this 1990's version, Burke was still as sharp as ever, big name guest stars abounded just like in the Sixties, and for a little while CBS looked like it had showcased a nice revival of a classy Sixties favorite to its lineup.
still feels there's a chance for December 25, so she agrees to try and change the mind of the Morgans, with the future of Yuletide at stake.
Though some may be able to, it would still be beyond me if you can somehow see through these disastrous details into its "warm-hearted cuteness."
Call me a "Grinch", but I still stand by the fact that this is definitely one holiday movie you could go without.
I still get goose bumps when I hear the wonderful duet "It Might Have Been" and the song with the lyric "every man shall be my brother" Unfortunately my copy is getting a bit worn and I would like to secure another copy.
After sixty years what is still most striking about this film are the evocations of Flemish Art from the opening scene in a market place crowded with Brueghel figurines to the subsequent groupings of the good burghers of Boom in the style of Rembrandt and the Rubenesque womenfolk.
Not to speak of the 1930s Hollywood counterparts, for which Feyder would have been light years off the mark, proving the point that there was and still is such a thing as the "French cultural exception".
I saw this movie over 2 years ago, and it still sticks in my memory as one of the best, most shocking, most eye-opening movies I've ever experienced.
With Argento still working in the genre ( he recently did a real good one called NonHoSonho) I hope it comes back and we have choice other than Scream, the Blair Witch Project and all of those stupid teenager so called " horror" movies.
I still had a fine time with it though, Antonio Bido has a good eye and easy command of his art, crafting some cracking moments, and Corrado Pani and Paola Tedesco make for an appealing couple of leads.
JOE, fire a 100 shots and still no one's hit.
It is most likely a side effect of having no loading screens but it still bothered me.
and if you don't play games, you should still play this game.'
If one can ignore the obvious political bias, it's still interesting.
Although not hard to predict given their "past performances," the finale was still dramatic and interesting to watch.
I've never played a crossword puzzle in my life and I still enjoyed the film.
If I was still trapped in CT I would consider going to the next tournament.
(Not sure if non-gamers would enjoy, but I would still encourage them to try it out.)
I have to admit that I'm no match for the people involved in the tournament, but it's still great to see this all.
But it's still entertaining.
Still, for all it's shortcomings, it's still a fun movie to watch.
It is a disappointment to see a women who is obviously talented still obsessed about having a man.
It is a film that all should see, male or female, to better understand the world around us and the strides that still need to be taken to ensure equality and peace.
It made me think of my own parents' idea of me as a woman and how that has influenced my upbringing and how it still influences their dreams and expectations for my future.
Women still don't have parity even in the West.
Remarkably, she can be experiencing dire personal struggles yet still the professional in her captures it on film.
You can watch this movie straight through without missing a second and still feel as though you walked away from it several times for 5 minutes.
I watched it (sporadically) on tv for free, and I still regretted it.
Jeff Morrow is so bad in this, I'm shocked to see he still had a career afterward.
I still love the movie despite its problems.
This made-for-TV movie was so good that 11 years after having watched it I still can't get it out of my mind.
Monty Python is still the right choice if you want to see some real humor.
While the Roger Corman/Vincent Price version of the tale is far better, this update still has a lot in store for the horror fan, most notably it's superb European styled atmosphere, and a fine performance by Lance Henriksen, which may even be the best of his career.
European movies are so interesting and rich in comparison with US films, and I don't get how is possible that people still watch low quality stuff, when there are masterworks like this one.
And not only the main characters, as every single one of them (no matter how small the role is) is highly detailed and serves a specific function as if the whole building was one of the odd machines that still work in this post-apocalyptic portrait of France.
Their very own brand of surrealist fantasy flows freely through the film making a unique visual fest (although it definitely goes a bit over-the-top at times), and while it doesn't reach the artistic level of their follow-up (the 1995 classic "La CitÃ© Des Enfants Perdus"), it's still a nicely done movie that most importantly, never gets boring or tiresome.
While "Delicatessen" still shows the excess of the young and raw talent of Jeunet & Caro, it's not hard to see why they became known worldwide after this initial success, as this movie shows the enormous potential of their skills as filmmakers.
In a stark contrast to Dreyfus, Marie-Laure Dougnac; the young lady that plays his daughter and love interest for Pinon is very down to earth, and is the most 'normal' character in the film...although there's still room for her to be a nearly blind klutz.
sort of mad max (see the prisoners and the atlantean first cities ) meets sinbad (SFX would still be poor if dated 20 years earlier ) meets cable TV tripe, like those "lost/treasure island" short telepictures from the 1960-70s for a young audience.
Harrihausen stop-motion animation in all its choppy glory still has an endearing quality that the sterile CGI effects of today could never duplicate.
One could complain about the cheesiness of the whole affair, or the less than stellar special effects, but for me it still adds up to likable, undemanding fantasy escapism.
The monsters may not be that high tech, but I'd still take these kinds of creations over CGI any day.
The Octopus still looks quite good now and the effects were good for then 1978.
My local video rental store is eliminating all of their VHS tapes and as I am still trapped in the 80s and do not have a DVD player I was more than happy to take some off their hands.
The big difference is that Next of Kin stays interesting through the whole movie right up to and including the end and still has some really great action scenes to boot.
I enjoyed it then, and I still enjoy it today.
So the plot is pretty basic, so what, it is still an enjoyable action/crime-drama.
The "project" was recognizably Cabrini-Green, and Truman and Jesse's restored three-story house could almost be pinpointed to Lincoln Park (except that the "bad guys", and Truman, would never have found such open parking - they'd still be circling the block).
But i thought that it was still a fantastic film.
You're stuck there in the best seat in the house, centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat - and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there, uncomfortable and itchy, thinking "When the F*** is this film ever going to END???"
Sometimes Robert DeNiro has stretched himself too thin and hasn't come off well in comedies such as WE'RE NO ANGELS and MAD DOG GLORY, but here his timing is virtually flawless, and his comic rapport with Billy Crystal (also excellent, as he avoids making his hapless but still dignified shrink a buffoon) is wonderful.
Visitor Q has the FEEL of a genuine SNUFF film, and I'm still not sure it isn't, actually.
His purpose is somewhat unclear but he somehow brings the family closer together, not that any of what they're doing is particularly Ozzie & Harriet but they're still doing things as a family again.
I still feel that the over use of video in Motion Pictures can be cheap and nasty lookin' but "Visitor Q" proves me wrong.
Some people have commented on the shortness of the series, but it was and still is common practice in England to produce seasons of less than 10 episodes per year, in order to maintain quality control over the content.
Yet the heirs to MGM's copyrights still reap millions annually from little Frances Ethel Gumm's blood, sweat, and tears.
It must still be fresh in Stark's memory, because something in 'Julietta' smells derivatively of the latter film.
And, viewing her later performances, one could see the fire still in her eyes, she was such a fighter!
But it's still well-observed and disturbing, although it's almost as shocking to hear its really quite distinguished cast speaking in Forest of Dean accents as it is to see them dressed as children.
dennis potter is still the best playwright of the television age and this is his best work.
I'm still unclear on whether the sheriff was one of the seven mummies, whether he wanted the gold for himself or to protect it, or why he was after the amulet at all.
Nevertheless, he is still captivating as a giggling, psychopathic, sleazy town sheriff and supernatural 'mummy'.
i was left with lots of questions after this movie, but i still enjoyed watching it.
Maybe I'm being a touch harsh on it as I've seen far worse but I'm fed up of wasting my time with crap like this, having said that I'll still be stupid enough to be the first in the queue when the next low budget piece of crap gets released.
I'm still trying to figure out where the title "7 Mummies" comes from.
Unlike Hancock, Harry is thankfully still with us, and one hopes he gets his career back on track one day.
Later, when she arranges matters less formally and straddles his lap, he apologies because he still can't perform.
I can still feel the salty tears running down my face after seeing this as a kid.
This movie stuck me deeply - to the point now, I'm 46 yrs old & still think about this movie, happened to look it up to see if I can purchase it somewhere & found some leads (I hope).
I still love J.T.
At age 50, I still remember the profound effect this Holiday classic had on me as a kid.
The novelization is, by the way, still in print and can be found through Amazon, etc.
I can still feel the salty tears running down my face after seeing this as a kid.
After I got one I still had no luck until I, like so few others, got wind of a store in NYC called Carousel books and films.
during Religion class (they obtained a 16mm film of the show from Carousel Films, Inc. in New York City; back then, VCRs were still in their infancy).
for the next decade until I discovered in late 2001 that Carousel Film and Video (as they now call themselves) still owned the video rights to "J.T."
I think this movie made in 1969 would still hold its own today.
I haven't seen it in 30 years but still remember the feelings it provoked.
I still remember "I want me this cat I found"!
builds a paradise for the cat, when his mother won't let him bring the animal home; he creates an oasis of comfort for his pet in an abandoned tenement, showing that he still has a huge capacity for love despite his harsh surroundings.
He still has hope, and through his gift he gives hope to J.T.
It isn't shown on TV much; the last time was 1987 on CBS when they were still committed to showing programs that meant something to young people.
That said, maybe some reviewers are right that the audience wasn't 'there' yet, as the D&D gaming crowd was still mostly a little young to fall into the demographic they were shooting for...but I certainly loved it!
It is still missed.
At least I still had "Tales of the Gold Monkey".
In this Ernest film, Ernest has a job picking up golf balls, it's a crappy occupation (still, beats scrubbing toilets) but Ernest loves every minute of it, thanks to his vivid imagination that keeps him in his own little world where he pretends the golf balls are mines and he's a war hero of some kind.
I still laugh at the same scenes I laughed at when I first saw the film over fifteen years ago.
Now it's years later, and I'm still quoting its lines.
It's the type of comedy where most of the characters are intelligent but still end up at each other's throats because of differences in personality and background.
I give this movie a 9 because I've watched this movie a record 32 times (if not more in bits and pieces) and still manage to fall off the chair laughing through most parts of the movie.
I would still pay for any material about this movie that I can lay my hands on.
It'll still make you laugh continuously, but not as hard as the first time you saw it, when what was coming was a surprise.
The only thing I can figure is that a lot of snobbery about serious dramatic portrayals somehow being more worthy of honor than great comic performances still very much lives on in much of the film community.
Even though Marisa Tomei broke through and won Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards for her performance, an award she earned and much deserved, I still say underrated.
i still do.
The idea is small and it stretches out too far but its still great fun.
While Laurel and Hardy had begun to decline since hitting an-all time peak in 1937 (Way Out West), this was still only four years on, and just a year after the reasonably amusing A Chump At Oxford.
So it is that, despite having no back-up on the writing front and being acted off the screen by a crow, they still manage to find some last residual laughs in the tank.
Jokes like Ollie checking the time and spilling his drink down his shirt seem old now, but were possibly reasonably new then (and still considered good enough to be homaged 43 years later in The Young Ones).
While Stan and Ollie still looked much like their old selves in this film, it's like they were almost afraid to be those two zany characters from their GOOD movies, like they didn't feel like they could pull it off... like maybe they didn't believe in themselves anymore?
On the other hand, as accurate as I find all objections to the way this movie was made, the negatives still do not outweigh the positives.
Stanley still gets a few magical moments, like clipping the grass with tiny wire cutters and a bird on his shoulder, and trying to shave with a (lit) light bulb in his mouth.
Oliver shows off his physical deftness dancing with a crow, and he can still begin to run without getting anywhere.
This wasn't "hilarious" as everyone told me it was, but it was still very enjoyable and pretty solid entertainment.
But only we most dedicated of followers would even notice this, and even then some of us don't mind as long as we can laugh a bit (which we still do).
This is one of those typical Twentieth Century-Fox Laurel & Hardy pictures, that in style and humor quite differs from their early work but still has its certain charm and entertainment value, although the movie is far from an hilarious or great one.
There are a couple of sequences that are still are of comical greatness, such as the scene in which the boys ride in a jeep during a combat exercise but like often was the case in their later movies, there are more misses than hits with its humor.
Reason why this movie still works out quite well, is due to its well written story.
As the political upheavals increase Anna is more pugnacious in demanding her rights and the finest moments of the story demonstrate how a child can respond to political change and still find her 'place' in the world that she chooses!
But despite this, The Brothers Bloom is still a very enjoyable movie.
Sure, the movie is named for the Brothers, but not only was the script originally titled Penelope, Penelope's quirky character also still brims with so much mystery and potential for surprise in the finished film that one can't help but wonder if the resolution of her character's journey won't place the spotlight firmly on her.
All that said, I'll still be lining up for tickets ASAP when Johnson's next film comes out.
The Walsh parents showed up at the very last second to remark how James Eckhouse lost his hair and to bellow how everyone grew up (like they didn't already know it since half the cast is still bumming around in showbiz).
He is famous as a kind of art film director, and his films are also not that failed but still his name is popular but his films are not that much, I think.
Think of that scene in James Dean's "Rebel Without a Cause" where the father of Dean's love interest becomes angry when she still wants to have close physical affection with him, you can tell that buried beneath he has desires for his daughter, and hence he becomes easily angry and strikes out at her.
This old man still desires, but it's plainly obvious that the girl is much to young for him, and that he cannot compete with younger men.
It's still probably worth watching-- one reason being: to see what kind of sap a talented artist is able to produce apparently without flinching an eye.
I'm not sure what I make of it all, however I do know the film still haunts me and on some level colored everything I watched after that.
However the film still breezes through without identity crisis or confusion.
Even by the time everything comes together, there was still no desire to care about any of these characters or the idea behind the movie.
Chrysalis breaks the Hollywood conventions as well and still stands firm in the French tradition.
And though I've watched it twice and am still not sure of exactly all that happened, I don't care.
Sure we get Spider-man, Wolverine, Venom, Daredevil and more to choose from, however the marvel universe is so expansive you could have had twice the number of marvel characters and still had the three they choose to knock out of action early.
My connection (DSL) created some jumpiness, but there was still a lot of quality visible, from a story by the great Oliver Drake, to directing by the equally great Joseph Kane.
To be honest, I rated it higher than I felt what I saw deserved, with my jumpy connection and the abysmal attempts at "comedy," but, still, it's the Mesquiteers and Drake and Kane, and some great stunt work (the unsurpassed Yakima Canutt) and great camera angles, and what was apparently great stock footage in spots, and an exciting score by the great Raoul Kraushaar.
The kid actors were very charismatic, and still kids.
Yet, this movie still shows the themes of the struggles of growing up and making choices.
The filmmakers did a beautiful job of capturing the excitement of the adventure while still maintaining the humanity and innocence of the two boys, played perfectly by Jesse James and Reilly McClendon.
And while there may be a few elements too rough for the youngest viewers, this is still a great film for the whole family.
I still cannot believe I wasted my time because of this movie.
I have still bearing the questions about the place of Dragonball Z that was it really necessary - That Gohan character, or Goku's being grown up, etc...
So when his granddaughter Pan gets sick, he's not there for her yet he is there for his great-great grandson, that's helpful but still proves that he's a lazy runaway.
This film adheres more closely to the Giallo tradition of stylish and bloody murders than the earlier movie, but still finds time to ensure that the plot always revolves around the central situation.
That is of course assuming I'm still alive, a print of the film exists and McDonalds continues to pump out Quarter Pounders like no tomorrow.
OK so it didn't top No Holds Barred, but it was still fun to watch.
I will give it a 6 out of 10 stars, but its still very good, so don't take the low ratings and don't rent it, its worth it.
This was one of my favorite movies as a child, and it still is.
Sure, it is more kids movie than even a family movie, and it can not compete with glowing old stream-liners like Back To The Future, not to mention recent Harry Potters, etc., still, it delivers the unique combination of funny comedy and warm atmosphere of kindness and personal achievement.
Former 1950s teen heartthrob Tab Hunter, still looking very handsome here in his early 40s, stars as Eddie, an outwardly respectable high school phys ed teacher who is tormented by both his impotence and some childhood trauma involving his mother (which is left obscured by the filmmakers).
The conspiracy still seemed so new and mysterious with so much to look forward to.
Steven Seagal might be getting old and he also might not have the same shape he had 20 years ago but he certainly still can make a movie great just by being in it.
Well... this still is a direct to video release, I guess they have to include some cheesy stuff.
But I still kind of like him,strange isn't it?An affection forged in the white heat of his masterpiece "Under Siege" still holds sway.
No-ones motives are ever fully revealed, I still don't really know what that CIA guy played by Luke Goss is all about, why were Seagal & his men fighting at the start, who was Chapel & why did he hire people he couldn't control & the whole thing is just a mess that jumps around from scene to scene trying to be clever but it's so poorly put together it's annoyingly confusing.
Steven Seagal might be getting old and he also might not have the same shape he had 20 years ago but he certainly still can make a movie great just by being in it.
Well... this still is a direct to video release, I guess they have to include some cheesy stuff.
They look down right horrible, but still better than flash animation.
Its not perfect but even with its flaws and the following of a well worn path at times this still manages to be a solid little thriller of the B variety.
If the film be imperfect, the real film lover will still attempt to see it for what it wanted to be; for what it's actual *point* was.
However, allow me to still add that that if you are looking for a movie along this theme and want one that is *really* well done, watch "A Tale of Two Sisters."
The score (with the filmmakers realizing the not everything is of-the-moment, and the avant garde of the 30s would still be "processing" the avant garde of the 20s, teens, and before) gives us snippets of Le Sacre du Printemps and some of Satie's piano pieces.
But still, it is a very good love triangle story.
I am still affected by this film.
Philip Kaufman, does anyone remember just how handsome a man he was at that time, triggered performances that still haunt me to this day.
We still have suits and ties deciding what is "safe" and what we shouldn't be allowed to see.
It's like the writers thought to themselves, "Hmm, wow I blew all our money on cocaine and I still don't have an ending.
It even ended with the words on the screen saying "A few tribe still have not made contact with the outside world.
While he gives us a throughly entertaining Henry, I still however have trouble seeing this character as a writer of erotic fiction.
The cinematography left a little to be desired - the HD format still looks like video at times.
It is fortunate that a video record of the production still exists, complete with performances by Robarts, Dewhurst, Nicholas Surovy, Bill McCutcheon (as Mr. DePinna), Jack Dodson, and others of the original cast.
The original has a lot of nuttiness and common sense mingled into it, and is one of the few comedies of the 1930s that are still capable of revival.
When Tomme is a young adult, about to be married to young native, he runs into his father, who is still searching for him.
Jane Curtin, a rarely used actress, plays Maureen, the wife that has decided to move on, rather than to stay with Frank, yet, she still stays close to home.
I still want to go to movies.
They still had love but a past that showed many bumps, many choices and all in their eye contact.
Currently the slave trade is still quite active and unfortunately those still profiting from it skirt the law quite well.
Great title song by the 4 Tops ("Are You Bad Enough") doesn't measure up to the classic "Shaft" but still delivers.
Terry West will never be confused with Orsen Wells, hell, he'll never get confused with Lloyd Kaufman even, but this "Lord of the Rings" parody is still his clear best, and yes I know that's a bit of a back-handed compliment.
Amongst the native Indian tribes, that still live there, the infant mortality rate is something like about 80% and adults who live much past 40 years are rarities.
Production values are of the B-movie variety, (do people still really say B-movie anymore?
On repeated viewings, however, I have to say the film still holds up in the manner it was intended: over the top, extremely silly, fun.
Although they're quite well written - the "Hypno-Ray" song still sticks in my memory - the songs do seem a bit out of place, but when you're watching the story of an alcoholic ex-superhero who's retired to Australia, well...
But money can't buy you brains: learning nothing from their real mistakes, they still throw logic to the wind at every opportunity, this time working from a script by Jim Vance, the first movie's hipster boyfriend.
what strikes me about this film is not only the explicit content, but a brief sex scene between the killer and the young girl, which she (the character) willingly participates in (its obviously a body double, but still!?)
Lisa Gastoni (at 43) is still a sensual and attractive woman and has her hair dyed reddish blonde here, but this proved to be the last of several roles in a similar mode Â to which I alluded above and of which I wouldn't mind catching Jerzy Kawalerowicz's MADDALENA (1971) and Giulio Petroni's LABBRE DI LURIDO BLU (1975); in fact, she went into a long period of retirement right after this one before re-emerging two years ago.
I don't care that they of course didn't REALLY shoot the horses, it was still gratuitously sick.
(Actually, Richard Jaeckel, Skip Homeier and Richard Boone played numerous bad guys who I still enjoyed watching even though I wanted them to 'get theirs'.)
Marshal Ward was suppose to be such a good shot to make such misses at still targets.
He then missed Will Kane and Ben Irons sitting still at a closer distance, several times.
Having failed to do so and still retaining the High Noon title it does open itself up to the unfair criticism of being a rip off of the original.
Even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl was still wanting to play with the kits.
We still don't know when we'll see each other again, but we will.
Seen on my TV, the photography is not as breathtaking, though it is still very beautiful.
The wildlife footage is still fascinating.
Still worth it if they can sit still.
My friends are still fooled by its graphics, they think this game was made recently.It still is and will always be my favorite game.
Passable, satisfying cannibal film, still does not hold a candle to Cannibal Holocaust.
It is interesting to hear the makers' own opinions on these (low) films nowadays, now that most of the directors have retired and are old men, and the actors also aging but still possibly in the business.
Still Cannibal Apocalypse has a place in the minds, hearts and shelves of the enthusiasts of Italian (exploitation) horror cinema which still has MUCH more noteworthy and greater pieces to offer and thankfully so.
The story may be complete bunkum, and the dialogue rather cheesy, but Antonio Margheriti's Cannibal Apocalype is still a great way to pass the time.
1980: a drab, miserable year, but a time when the culture was still pretty active and vibrant.
Corporate-domination of film and most other media hadn't been-consummated yet, so there were still genuine indie films, and it was a sad thing to watch all this die as a kid.
This is really why horror wasn't that good in North America for some-time, and it's still trying to recover (a wait-and-see).
The Vietnam war had only been over for five-years when Cannibal Apocalypse was released, so the wounds were still ripe.
Speaking of being bored, Christopher Lee doesn't exactly approach his role in this film with gusto and his performance, although still malevolent as Lee always is, pretty much is the epitome of this film; bored.
Choosing to develop To The Devil A Daughter, however, was probably a bad decision: budgetary constraints meant that a faithful interpretation of Wheatley's book was impossible to achieve, and after much script wrangling, filming went ahead whilst further revisions were still being made.
With such a troubled production, To The Devil A Daughter is an understandably less than perfect film, but despite its flaws, it still proves to be an entertaining dose of Satanic nonsense.
Nowadays it's seen as something of a curiosity: a well-intentioned but belated addition to the Satanic horror cycle, still distinctly Hammer but laced with tasteless moments that don't do anyone involved any credit at all, and at times so clumsily edited that you're never really sure what's going on.
It seems to serve no purpose at all, and yet at one point is thrust up into Nastassja Kinski's womb, and at another has its throat cut on camera while it's still wriggling and crying.
I still believe the film was good and I understand for the most part that is really what happens but Boorman could have made the film a bit more interesting and different and still portray his message.
Nanny by now has become friends with Peter, even to the point of his letting her use the apartment to write in while he's in the office and Iris is still out of town.
I'm kinda warming to Ms. Rogers, though I'm still not finding her face memorable.
She brings her brand of energy to her roles, so that she stands out even when the role or even her acting isn't all that good, she still shines.
While not big on acting talent, she was still capable enough to fit perfectly into femme fatale roles in film-noir movies (e.g.
Gene Tierney still looks good, but doesn't have much to do.
And I love Soliel Moon Frye, she is still pretty cool.
This is, in fact, the live proof that a witty, well-written series can actually be successful in our country, and I hope it will still run for a few more years to come.
I Like ManiRtanams movies  But Geetanjali is something different and its a class of its own in the sense even if you see after 15-20 yrs its still looks fresh story.
It still is even though the year is 2005.
I saw this film, accidentally, in t.v., and I feel astonished how dramatic stories can be expressed by so simple and poor instruments and, still, be so strong and unforgetable.
It doesn't make this the fastest or best flowing Columbo movie but its story still keeps the movie interesting throughout.
The acting isn't great, the plot's a little cheesy... but the movie still has very redeeming qualities: First off, the Dodge Turbo Interceptor is a bad-A car.
But, its still just as fun to watch as it was when i was younger and watched it.
In my opinion the key elements which make it in every part a "sci fi classic" is it still remains the one movie l can continually watch over and over again.If you allow yourself not to scrutinize certain predictable outcomes and appreciate the legacy of what essential was a low budget film,it has in my opinion more than delivered a satisfactory movie.
I've seen this movie several times, but it's still amazing!
But you still need to see "The Wraith".
The bit where Jake's scrambler breaks into 4 meteorites still looks great, the tasteful re-animation of the Wraith mobile after crashes (nowadays that would probably be done using reverse photography).
As a b-movie for it's time, it is a technically superior easy watch which still towers over many newer movies of the same genre.
Okay, so it was very low budget and looked like a high-school class assignment, it was still somebodies baby.
Even if you hate the movie, remember two things: It is easier to criticize than to do; even a bad example is still an example.
this zombie movie was just corny,and made no sense.It was also so slow the jokes were just hours long and the dialogue was cut and so slow this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen by far.Mostly I never read ratings and decide if the movie is bad or not on my own but this was one of those cases when you should.There's bad and there's horribly stupid disgusting waist of time and this is past that.The makeup was horrible and was more of a porno then a zombie movie,The acting was the worst i have ever seen, a 5 year old could do better.Wow I'm still disgusted on how horribly bad this movie is blah!blah!blah!
I'm still laughing about it!
So he goes, and after one of the most brilliant montages ever, hes able to return home a ninja, though like a lot of kung-fu films he still doubts his true ability.
In Strange Illusion, at 51, his profile was still as sharp as a crease, but his face was beginning to look its age.
Paul also feels that Barrington faked his own death and is now back to eliminate those who may be able to expose him as still being alive by being in the position of finding Judge Cartwright secret files; the Judge's family.
While traveling after signing the papers they discover discover an old diary and some pictures, things which tell the story of a serial killer, a killer that may still be operating.
Even while the film isn't making a whole lot of sense, however, it still remains interesting by way of its atmosphere.
What seems initially to be a giallo movie (and arguably still is) becomes a bit more supernatural than is usual for that subgenre.
And, if you're like me, and are still young or even old for that matter, the guys, especially Casper Zafer(Gaston) and Nico Nicotera (Etienne) and some other young Musketeers are very nice eye candy :)!
I liked John Rhys-Davies in it, as he is one of my favorite actors, but he must have still been in his Gimli stage when doing it because he came across with that sort of Scottish accent of the dwarf.
In this Hallmark TV production Louis XIV is still under the thumb of Cardinal Mazarin (Gerard Depardieu).
The story, however drawn out it becomes, still contains enough of Dumas' great swashbuckling tales of derring-do, evil, honor and action to be entertaining.
And they, although sometimes out of breath, are still the best around.
Eddie Murphey is still funny but I still liked him better in his R rated films.
Oh well, perhaps children will still find the movie funny in parts, though some of the jokes are obviously aimed toward adults.
So humour, Gothic scenery, and hints of horror make this film a delight to watch...over and over again; I am still SHOCKED by the negativity towards it though.
"The Haunted Mansion" is no "Pirates of the Caribbean," but it is still worth a look.
When this movie came out critics and audiences were saying how rubbish it was and it was a waste of time and money, but as i have a keen interest in the paranormal i still wanted to see it anyway and i glad i did!
Nothing spectacular, but still not too cheesy looking.
and still find myself thinking about it.
The battles are a lot smaller scale than normal and have more of a guerrilla war flavour to them, but they are still as gripping as ever and the fights come fast and frequent.
Being over forty years old and still not knowing that much about love in the true sense of the word, I will refrain from stereotyping what I don't understand.
I was only 13 and I still remember it.
He's shown better moves elsewhere, and no one expects great acting from him, but he still delivers an adequate performance.
Scooby and Shaggy have still got their fun and charm, and there are one or two appearances from Scooby Dumb.
All in all, not as good as Scooby Doo Where are You, but is still an improvement over most of the stuff with Scrappy in.
He was still safe.
As a mature Racer, Rex, finally realizes his own inherent values and becomes independent but still feels obligated to his younger bother Speed.
While I still think it was complete crap, this is only in regard to the American version of the show.
I still haven't quite figured out what really to think of this filmÂBy no means it's a mind-blowing thriller or even a memorable eurohorror entry.
Though I'd rather have seen it in the original language with subtitles, I'm still happy Anchor Bay has rescued it and released it on DVD for folks like me who enjoy obscure films.
And Clerks still is great today.
Even if you aren't a fan of the film, you still have to respect the achievements he has made, going from store clerk to successful filmmaker with this one little black and white gem.
11 years on this film is still the best Kevin Smith has done.
Caitleen Bree, who is still secretly loved by Dante, even after she cheated on him 81/2 times, and who is marrying an Asian Design Major.
Kevin Smith has delved into action ("Mallrats"), drama ("Chasing Amy") and philosophy ("Dogma") in his Askewniverse, but Clerks, the first film of the series, is still the best.
But in my humble opinion, it's still Smith's best.
I still want to know who the Face was.
Enter a 'conflict' point in the film, and also enter a very big 'clunk' of disbelief for me: why would such an upwardly mobile, very ambitious guy, who escaped the tedious, dead-end life of a suburban Jerseyite, still consider the pathetic, terminally whiny Elliot his very best friend after all these years?
Lots of sub plots are thrown at you and still no story can be found.
When "The Last Rebel" came out, it was still acceptable to refer to African-Americans by the 'n' word.
The director attended the screening and explained that they were still editing the film, and he seemed to acknowledge that it was difficult to hear at times.
I bought this garbage for only $3 in the used DVD bargain bin, and I still feel ripped off and cheated - out of money and time.
Most of them are still an "art", not like Hollywood-made ones.
Nevertheless, even with the flaws in this movie is still worth watching.
But still, its a good, light-hearted comedy that'll still get a few laughs even today.
There could also be a college level version of the course also, the controversy generated would be just as educational as the content....as, no doubt, there are still many American's who still don't "get" what the organized labor movement was/is all about.
Most of the movie is pure nude soft porn acting with a little creepiness thrown in especially the decayed toothed butler that really gave me the creeps, ohhh I can still see those teeth!
For the most part, this is very dream-like (or nightmare-like, to be more accurate), and while it's somewhat nonsensical it's still quite interesting and a far better offering than the other trash I've seen by this director.
4.Its a Cult flick(Enjoyed by some and despised by most)  The reason i didn't give it full marks is that it doesn't have as much nudity as i wished for,but still pretty good.It has very good atmosphere which i totally love about these movies and the wooden acting also makes me happy.If i want to see great acting i would watch a Mira Nair film.
Which still isn't bad but not as quick as you initially think !
It's still something people talk about and I regularly pop the DVD into the player to show friends.
It's still the same open jawed reaction !
Even if it was done in a Parisian taxi, the footage is still amazing.
It's still an amazing piece of film footage.
I have seen this movie several time and I am still impressed and deeply touched by the way the movie tells the story of Amy Dustin.
And if you're still not convinced, then you're a very weird person!
So, I tried the unique "watch-able" movie there, the unique romance, the unique that still had some tickets in that competitive world: "Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Laurence".
It's still quite a lot of fun, and pretty far from boring to say the least.
It's a TERRIBLE film - my dad's in it, and I still have to say it.
But Roger Moore - then still the reigning James Bond - as a women bashing, cold-blooded and bearded anti-terrorist expert does not just save the day but runs away with every scene he is in and eventually with the movie itself.
Its still captives me every time after having seen it possibly more than 30 times, if anyone reading this could explain the scene to me where Harald (cramers No.2 guy) says that it feels like the last minute and asks about the escape plan.
Also, see it because it is still a solid movie after 22 years and I still am entertained after 20+ viewings.
10 of 10 mainly because of Roger Moore, but can still stand on its own.
So it's no wonder, that his role as Rufus Excalibur Ffolkes is miles away from 007, but it's still Moore.
This movie also gives you an idea on what life was like during the 1950's including a village fete which were popular at the time and still are today.
it was a film that was absolutely perfect with not a mistake in sight!Oh so scary and frightening and hilarious rolled into one!But that goes for the experience at the movies1On DVD it lost that sense of scariness as the film is not knowing who is doing what and not knowing really what is going on.in the movies,you sit in darkness for 2 hours with up to 200 strangers.this added a sense of scariness to the film.that sense was lost on DVD.it still has the odd scare on DVDand is still hilarious but through out the film i felt a sense of loss.but i would still watch it over and over for entertainment value purely but to do with scare i don't think so.it might be different for people who ONLY saw it on DVD but for those in the UK and Ireland where it is still on release,see it in the cinema first.still highly recommended outside of movies though
It had a new and fresh feeling with teens and it worked, despite how it seemed a bit more predictable than Rear Window, it still was pretty clever.
Disturbia is loosely based off the 1954 Alfred Hitchcock classic Rear Window, but it is still a film all in itself, and it is the best thriller I've seen in a while.
The movie makes you laugh uncontrollably in parts where you KNOW something funny is going to happen yet still laugh because it's outrageous.
Even though there is nudity, and they want that R rating, they still had to cut back on the f***s and other rude language, but that's not what really held this film back.
Despite all of its flaws, Mallrats is still one of my favorite films, and definitely my favorite comedy.
I still give it a 10/10, but it could have been an 11.
Even at double the ordinary speed, it was still slow moving.
Perhaps about the importance of the everyday matters of no significance, which can still, somehow, ruin our life.
Everytime i see the film it still cracks me up, even after a few years have passed (nearly a decade....does time go that fast!!!)
After the success of Clerks gritty, realistic story, Kevin Smith was given a budget (still small) and more respectable actors to work with.
Playing a slightly more central role than in Clerks, these two are still great.
I still think that this is a film for people who know films by Kevin Smith.
I'm not a big fan of Smith's work, as I've only caught his first three flicks and I still think his third film "Chasing Amy" is the best.
But this commercially mainstream project isn't all a failure, because the film still does come up with an entertaining tale of laid-back characters with a muster of jokes set-up in a mall.
It's not his best, it has flaws, but it's still classic Smith!
We were told this was because the audio sources varied, but I still felt like this could've been corrected.
Instead, the decision to shave his moustache is so jarring that he "jumps" to timeline A, or more accurately he jumps to timeline A but elements of timeline B are still known to him, such as the photographs of his vacation, the license in his wallet, and his overall consciousness and memories are still from timeline B.
Ten years later, the trend is still going strong, with at least a couple dozen films with the same concept of hand-held terror.
Maybe THE SPLIT felt too calculated to Maltin, but to me, it represents the era when Hollywood entertainment still managed to assuredly deliver the authentic exploitation of a formula.
It's as if the film were stating that Hollywood needs to pull the breaks a little, but still not give in entirely to the Puritan demands.
These films do not have nice tidy plot lines where everything makes sense -- they are still brilliant films.
Maugham was a successful West End dramatist, whose works are still revived on occasion (in 1990 I saw Glynis Johns and Stewart Granger in a revival of Maugham's comedy THE CIRCLE).
It's his short stories and novels that people still read, not his plays.
We are still stuck in a post-code madonna/whore view of women that was clearly not in place in the early 30s.
It might be obvious not long after he turns up what he is after but its still a good film.
As a child my daughter was traumatized when I took her to see 'Cement Garden' and she still reminds me that it damaged her psyche.
This movie still sticks in my mind 36 years later as one of the most effective dramas I've seen.
Eight children whose mother's just passed away want to go on with their life as if nothing happened.Besides ,they do believe that their mother is still with them,and Pamela Franklin 's rendering is absolutely stunning when she acts as some kind of medium:far from the usual clichÃ©s -as you can see in "ghost" for instance-,she will give you goose pimples.This mother will remain a mystery,maybe a saint steeped in piety,maybe somebody much worse than a goody-two-shoes,as Charlie eventually claims.
We see a girl walking the street of a suburban part of London and immediately one knows that this is a film different to many others Â it's slow, it's silent, and still it's intriguing and exciting.
Upon their close relationship on the one and their fear of being torn apart from each other at the other side, the children decide to keep on living `normally', as if their mother was still alive.
As expectable with children these age (ranging from, I'd guess, ages 3 to 12), they create their rituals (the German translation of the title is `Every evening at 9 o'clock') and manage to find a way to keep in touch with their world `before' Â when the beloved mother was still live.
This is where the writer/director weaves two fundamental issues together: first, there is the male angst about whether his wife still loves him - which generates the bizarre dream set in Paris (while they are both on holiday in China) and second, there is the deeper philosophical issue about reality itself.
I even enjoyed the Kyle MacLachlan-esquire style of Andras Jones Â then there was Ted Raimi, whom didn't almost fit within this film, but still made it fun to see him sweat.
I still see its scenes playing back in my mind as I try to wrap my thoughts around the plot.
But we still have the bullmoose loud senator, the dippy but earnest girlie, the solid naval officer and such.
By a lucky accident, it was a way to earn decent money, be relatively cosmopolitan but still stay in a role of servitude.
He starts by asking his live-in lover Agnes (Manu Devos) whether she would still fancy him sans moustache; since she's only known him with it she can't answer.
The best Sherlock Holmes films tend to be the ones with a horror element (such as The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Scarlet Claw), but even though this one offers nothing in the way of horror; it still manages to present an excellent mystery for Holmes to unravel.
"Washington" is one of weaker entries in the series, but still enjoyable on its own merits as a B picture.
Although not based on any particular tale from the Canon, there is still enough mystery and intrigue to keep detective fans well satisfied.
Many can't relate to the emptiness of Chuco or the inner struggle of his older brother but these stories are ones that have played out for years and are still relevant today.
These scenes are still available on the old Video Treasures VHS release that is available used.
After that I waited for 10 years before it came on TV and it still holds up today.
I was just watching a bunch of people talking about the Andy Griffith Show ans the Don Knotts Barney Fife character and immediately, I thought about this film and one scene that still makes me laugh out loud when I think of it.
Even though at the time I wasn't old enough to get all the jokes, It still had a magic around it that was clearly evident.
he is rivaled by George Carlin in a dramatic role a first for Carlin This movie shows us how the tale Ends but to me it still leaves a lot out maybe to lead to another story in the Lonesome Dove universe about the Final Years of Woodrow Call.
The narrator waxes admiringly about how the Muslims were using paper when Europe was still using parchment.
Was still coming down off the high of the series finale of TNG as it was extraordinary.
If people of the future don't need money, yet ferengi still value the non-replicatable gold-encased liquid latinum(the gold is a worthless container for up to a few drops of latinum) for it's rarity, then how does the cast ever afford to go to Quark's, or the holo-suites, or anywhere on the promenade, including tailoring by Garak?
Oh by the way, in the first season of TNG they mention gold as being valuable still - so that's weird.
When reading the reviews, I agreed with Neil Doyle's, though I felt he was still way too kind to this incredibly annoying and stupid film.
SPOILER (not that it matters...) Final ridiculous turn - the entire world has been destroyed by nuclear war, but they find one area that wasn't targeted by a nuke and therefore is still a beautiful green sunny place, with no radiation and no nuclear winter and little children playing ball.
Nice to know in the future we'll still have second-rate casinos in this country, equipped with slot-machines circa 1977.
The other character is more realistic, but still too military.
Killer cockroaches, Jan Michael Vincent, Paul Winfield, George Peppard, giant scorpions, ultimate SUV's, inbred hillbilly types and dusty old Las Vegas where the slots still work...all combine to make a fun little, albeit cheesy, flick.
As a kid this movie was a fun Saturday matinee movie and to this day, still a fun Saturday Matinee movie...grab a big bucket of popcorn, turn your brain off and have some cheesy fun...
Even considering it was a low budget movie it was still a very good story and very well acted.
My favorite part of course is the Landmaster vehicles it was and still is one of coolest movie vehicles ever made.
4) Jan-Micheal Vincent has his eyes open, and George Peppard was still in his pre-"A-Team" form.
This is one seriously incoherent mess of a film, and even though the 'Landmaster' truck still remains an ultra-cool method of transportation, the rest of the scenery and special effects are pathetic and not the least bit convincing.
She forcely drags him into Neverland where they meet his old nemesis , the one armed chief pirate Captain James Hook (Dustin Hoffman) who still wants his revenge.
I still cry during the scene where Pan goes back to the tree where the lost boys hid out in the original cartoon.
Also, the story is believable in its unbelievability - I still like to think my kindergarten-crush will pop up and be right for me.
I'm 19 years old and I saw this movie eleven years ago (1992) and I still love it after over a dozen viewings.
Also Dustin Hoffman is still as intimidating as I remember him.
Hook is undeniably a love or hate movie, but even after so long, I still like it, though I don't think I could call it a classic to be perfectly honest.
I had watched the movie when it came out and found it very pleasant and enjoyable and, re-watching it again just recently, I still found it a very good movie   The movie's strong points to me are the scenery and design, the storyline, the music and the quality of acting by most of the cast.
The Lost Boys were terrible -they came across as bratty, overindulged hoodlums rather than young, innocent, mischievous children and it was quite impossible to feel any empathy with or them -they were good actors but badly written characters   Nevertheless, despite these flaws, this is still a worthwhile and enjoyable movie that I think young children will enjoy.
Kevin Conroy is still the best actor to play Batman (IMO), and Mark Hamill (!)
On top of that, he's got the emotional turmoil of reliving his first love and the reasons she left himÂand the fact that maybe he's tired of being Batman, that he wants a normal life but he still feels driven to work off the guilt of his parent's death and the pressure of the vow he made to them.
Batman is a character that should have everything but still not be able to obtain the small things that we normal folk hold dear.
The former love of his life Andrea Beaumont with her father comes back to Gotham as Bruce Wayne falls for her again, however there's trouble stirring in town as an unknown and mysterious villain called The Phantasm is killing off gangster members one-by-one and The Joker (voiced by Mark Hamil) is next on his list as Batman must find this mystery killer or still be romancing his love.
To this day this is still my favorite Batman movie, in my opinion it dwarfs all the live action movies, yes even The Dark Knight!
Luke Skywalker voices the Joker and I still stand by the claim that he should have been cast as the joker in the next Batman movie.
Without Walker the movie would still have been good but not great so I hope that more people give this amazing woman the respect that she deserves.
But it still retains that dark edge the 2 previous movies had and many visual thrills.
Although much of Danny Elfman's theme is missing the music is still powerful and involving.
The visual style still sticks to that of the comic book like glue and it all makes for a very exciting film.
the camera goes to a close view of Bruce's lower torso, Alfred still in the background watching.
Out of all the Batman films so far, including all the live action films, this one is still the only one to really explore the character of Bruce Wayne/Batman and examine what drove him to becoming Batman.
It was only a dollar but out of principle I still feel dirty having supported this movie in any way.
It should be noted that most acts of terrorism are done with ideological motivation, rather than religious ones, but still in this movie you see the 'terrorists' praying to the east every other ten minutes, and in almost every line they speak about Allah, and their devotion to Islam.
For the life of me, I still can't figure out why Traitor is getting such poor promotion, but if I were the studio I'd be trying my damnedest to get people into the theatre to this.
One of the ways you can tell a movie is good is if you watch it multiple times and still find something new or amusing in the story each time.
Unfortunately, this movie falls prey to an overwrought treatment of what many would consider to be a still esoteric, but increasingly popular, subject.
Many nations, including the United States, realized that winemaking could be approached using new techniques while still adhering to terroir and tradition.
Certainly this Coen brothers comedy "Burn After Reading" will not be no Oscar winner like their previous effort "No Country for Old Men", but still the direction and over the top funny story makes this offbeat film one to watch.
It's good for some laughs, and it's still rather Coen-y so go pick it up.
It may not be as strong as The Big Lebowski but nonetheless proves that when it comes to sarcastic humor the Coens still stand way above the rest.
I remember seeing the "Trouble with Harry" which seems like a million years ago but still remember laughing my head off.
I think critics are taking this movie way to seriously ...its a movie a comedy made for laughter and ones personal enjoyment don't come on here bashing it and saying rude things just because you didn't like it...frankly, I really don't care if you liked it or not because it was a good silly laugh out loud movie...my friends and I still quote this movie and laugh about the crazy scenes If people just want a feel good movie that'll make you laugh and give you and your friends something to do this movie is perfect... Chyna*
After watching this movie, I can watch again and its is still funny, I recommended it to my m8s and they love it too, hell they wanted to watch it again.
Anderson isn't totally convincing in the role, since some of his ghetto slang pops up even when he's not playing the part of a stereotypical black man from the hood, but he's still very funny.
I didn't feel the second half was too strong, as they spent too much time trying to wrap the plot up, not enough time on humor, but all in all it was still pretty funny.
The Hunt for Red October -- the best film adaptation of the Jack Ryan series thus far -- still stands as my favorite film of all time.
You still there Jim?
His trip takes him through California and Oregon, where he learned that while his girlfriend was replaced by an android, others that vanished with her on an airplane flight she was on are still human.
And so we see a spell and a trick, yet Cinderella still gets her man.
The opening song is hysterical when it gets them and Drusilla's every sarcastic remark still makes me smile ("A stick... let's beat her with it."
While this film's animation hasn't the beauty of other Disney flicks, it still retains enough of the magic to keep you riveted.
I watched this worried that it would be worse than Cinderella 2, which I still think is one of the weaker Disney sequels, and guess what?
The whole movie still has that "I'm not even going to try to live up to my original" sequel feel.
I don't write this review to simply be critical of this piece of poorly-conceived garbage, but rather as a warning to all the Clancy fans out there still considering seeing this movie.
I love the way she progresses and shows that though someone may come from a family of cold black hearts, that one person can still be warm and caring on the inside if given the chance.
And because I still think like a kid, I say you should listen to me on this.
Cinderella III also gives the character of the Prince a chance to develop (even though they still don't give him a name!)
Disney's watered down version still taught that lesson- sort of.
Well, this is still a Disney film so magic is used and the slipper now fits Anastasia.
still worth a watch if it happens to be on tv.
Whether Dolly had her own reasons for offering the information is still open to debate.
The plant shut down one year after Silkwood's death, and there is still debate about whether or not plutonium from Kerr-McGee was supplied to Middle Eastern entities.
SIlkwood was a movie that had to deal with the reality of situations that are still considered problems today.
they still have not found who plotted to kill her or who really did kill her.
It's still not as dramatic as reading the book.
I was expecting some cheesy romantic line here, but instead he goes, "Well, I still want to f*ck you...I sure as h*ll don't wanna f*ck Thelma anymore though!"
Everything is pulled together neatly and tightly by Mike Nichols here, and the movie, despite the 80's haircuts and style, still gets you going today.
Several scenes could be trimmed or cut entirely, and Karen's character arc would still be in place.
She plays Karen Silkwood excellently, and although she doesn't resemble any likeness to the real Karen Silkwood, she still manages to fool us that she is actually the strong woman herself.
She changes, however, when she realises that the management of the plant have a cavalier attitude towards the health and safety of their employees, particularly the risks of radioactive contamination, and that, worse still, they are doctoring x-ray photographs of the fuel rods in order to cover up potential defects that could prove disastrous.
While not one of the best movies of its type, it's still pretty well done.
If she had not spoke up in the seventies, Kerr-McGhee would still have a nuclear reactor plant in Crescent, Oklahoma.
It's her wrecked car being slowly towed past the restaurant where a union meeting is still in progress.
This game is still in my library and i still play from time to time.
When horse riding, the skirt was pulled through between the legs, still covering the knees.
I won't go into too much detail here, not even sure you're still reading this.
The island was called Ynis Mon, still known by that name in Wales today.
When poltergeists appear, Crane still doesn't believe until one fateful night... My only problem with this is that it does not remain trueful to the book by Irving.
The story is a little modified from the original but that's okay, it still works very well.
In many ways, the Disney one is still my favorite.
I've seen 3 other Sleepy Hollows, including the most recent one with Johnny Depp, and I still prefer this one.
I grew up with this movie and still love it, from the period clothing and locations to the close ups of Palmer in the barn.
When this TVM was made in 1999 I was still somewhat ignorant of the internet .
For example if the internet collapsed tomorrow computers would still work even if it means you can't send emails or write reviews at the IMDb .
I could still use my computer as a word processor or play computer games etc the world wouldn't suddenly revert to the stone age because the internet failed   There's also several other blunders which led me to believe that the writers are nowhere near as being smart as their audience .
I have since purchased the video and watched it two or three more times, still loving it each time.
In fact it's all still somewhat a wash to me.
Even with over two hours they still came back with this slop.
While Hollywood had just about completely switched over to talkies by 1929, several nations still produced silents well into the 1930s--among them France, Japan and China.
It was a pretty upbeat movie, and a few parts had me laughing, but it mostly consisted of making-fun of common film clichÃ©s and stereotypes, and despite this, the film still employed a few of these on its own.
When the movie was over I had a smile on my face and I am still thinking about the provocative theme of the story days later.
An incredibly insightful and daring film that works on so many levels that my friends and I are still talking about it and going "Whoa!"
i mean, since the sixties our society has bandaged itself up and learned some lessons about radical politics, and our country is still full of idiots.
But still, "Woodstock" transports you back to the era, and everything associated with it.
I understand that she was so messed up that she could barely perform, but she was still part of the gig.
The greatest rock artists like "the Who","Ten Years After","Crosby,Stills,Nash & Young","Jefferson Airplane","Country Joe & the Fish,"Jimi,the Great One,Hendrix" etcetera.Of course,some great artists and groups are missing like "the Doors" and "Pink Floyd".But still,it makes for an unforgettable 3,5 hours(I've got the Directors cut,which is critically acclaimed) of non-stop beautiful music and scenes from the festival visitors.
Not every artist or legendary event is shown in this documentary,artists like Joni Mitchell and the Band are not included which I personaly would have enjoyed.And the forgotten "Abbie Hoffman incident" is also not included.I have this incident on CD,the Who box set,but I would have liked it when I had on DVD also.But then,You can't have everything!Also some songs and artists are kind of misplaced.Best example for me is the performance of Sha-Na-Na doing "At the Hop".This Rock 'n Roll song doesn't quite belong on this festival,but still it is a funny sort of intermezzo.
This print is gated correctly, though still a bit rough going in terms of visuals; the print has a lot of wear.
with 56,000 us soldiers and other killed in Vietnam this is an historical piece what ever your opinion about the war, it is still a tragedy to lose 56,000 to the war.and to this day makes you wonder why?
Wadleigh shows a deep empathy for the men and women in charge of the festival (although you can still take him to task for his dishonorable treatment of some of the foot soldiers, most notably the Port-O-San man) as well as the townsfolk of Woodstock, New York; and he shows just as much passion for the music.
Janis, Jimi, Jerry Garcia and Max Yasgur have passed on, while bands like The Who and CSNY are still capturing the magic for legions of (aging) fans.
For someone who was part of that time, things that were "cool" back then now look and sound a little stupid and naive, but it's still fun to watch.
Weapons and locations are good: although the sounds of the weapons is historically incorrect it gives the player a rush: yes, the M1 Garand still is a great rifle.
But this was still a good game.
However, it might still be worth waiting till it gets cheaper than it's starting price.
Unfortunately for Dud, the writers didn't lose much sleep drafting some of the patchy story lines, in this average advertising/mental home comedy romp (is it still safe to say that?
Somehow the parts donÂ´t really add up but itÂ´s still worth watching.
Frankly, I wouldn't want a man living as my neighbor who would just stand still and meditate as two thugs butchered his wife and children.
Even if you manage to look past all that and try to enjoy it for the fights, it still disappoints: no original moves, lousy stunt work and 'enemies suddenly distracting each other so the main character can get away, even though all exits are locked' are some of the things that come into mind.
The characters still not being interesting enough (except Nico for the reasons above), and the male characters are being very unnecessary than it should.
I don't think you can do an entire series about them, and you can't put them in those roles and still try to make them just nice, hard-working underdogs just trying to get by.
Even during blackouts and air raid drills, we still had to depend on ordinary policemen to maintain order.
The standouts for me amongst the regular cast are Michael Kitchen who is incredibly effective in underplaying his role while still managing to make Foyle a very sympathetic character, and Honeysuckle Weeks who seems perfectly suited to her character.
My favourite is still Simon West.
This last sequence still has the power to unnerve the viewer sixty years later, and is one of the best of the Lewton "buses".
Whether this was intentional, or the child actor felt like doing it and didn't know the camera was on him, I don't know, but I found myself yelling at the DVD player, " That a..hole is still doing it!
When more young victims are claimed, Jerry begins to doubt that it's still the work of the leopard.
Since I still own it, I'll give it another look.
Their solutions proved inspired, resulting in a string of classics Â The Cat People, The Leopard Man, I Walked With A Zombie Â that still rank among the moodiest, most memorable fright-films ever made (with different directors, Lewton oversaw The Seventh Victim and other distinctive works in the same vein).
Perhaps not as mysteriously beautiful as "Cat People" or not as nightmarish as "The Body Snatcher", but still this Val Lewton production equally is a solid horror milestone that should be viewed by everyone who wants to learn about the roots of atmospheric horror.
Film tails off near the end, but is still a minor gem.
This movie isn't as full of great scenes as Cat People was, but there is still some really good stuff on display, including my favourite scene which sees someone mauled behind a closed door.
Venis looked pretty good in the ring, his character was still relatively fresh at this time.
Edge has always been tremendous in the ring, and even though he faces off with the talentless Marc Mero, he still manages to put on a decent match.
Shamrock is able to defeat Owen in the end, but I still applaud Owen because he was such a great wrestler.
A good documentary, not award winningly shot but the message is clear to see from the makers 'Don't get scorn by porn' Not for the faint hearted, I saw this when it came out and every time i see it i still feel really bad for her and that i should do something about it, mainly to those directly responsible for corrupting her.
If you're watching for the second reason you'll be bitterly disappointed since there's very little on screen sex but if you're watching for the sensible reason you'll still be as disappointed as the voyeurs .
As I said, this film is flawed in many ways, (I'll let you decide in what ways) but a few weeks later I still find myself thinking about the issues it raised.
I mean the scenes like "the suicide attempt" and the angry and almost comical face expression Chow gives to "Scarface" at one point; they show that these men really can act (and they can) but these kind of actions should be little more restrained and explained, but still Chow's character is here much better than in "City on Fire" which suffers a lot from the weak character of Chow's.
His real masterpiece was still to come (Full Contact) but still "Prison" is among the most noteworthy achievements of his.
Or maybe the disease is spread via the Olsen twins and everyone becomes anorexic cocaine addicts that still eat human flesh but then promptly vomit it back up so their re-animated asses don't get fat.
Even tho it was a good refreshing zombie movie, there still wasn't anything incredibly new.
While the influences of Night of the Living Dead(characters trapped in an apartment complex as infected humans await them outside)and 28 Days Later..(the "giddy-up" rat-humans, shaky cam style and running humans trying to escape as the predators pursue them)are undeniable, I still found "Mulberry St." a pulse-pounding thrill-ride.
Though we never learn exactly what happened to Casey and how that affected her relationship with her father, it is apparent that the relationship is strained even though there is still love between the two.
Or read the whole review, which will (once again) hype it up, and hopefully you'll still enjoy it as much as I did.
I really haven't been this freaked out by a movie since The Shining (albeit I only first saw The Shining only a couple years ago, but still...)   Not to say there weren't some parts that could've been better.
In a way it is still hard but it's starting to progress slowly because there still is a little racism out there somewhere.
There's still people who wants to leave a message to the viewer; people who has something to say.
Nivola, a talented but still not recognized performer (stole the show in the blockbuster "Goal!"
and brought grace alongside Amy Adams to "Junebug"), stars as Robin, the most rebellious kid of a small town which is no longer a kid but still does the mischief a teenager does when he wants to get attention.
He loves her and she loves him too, but she went to the University and he never finished high school and still doesn't know what to do with his life.
However, she still wants to do things with him but he is no fool.
Groucho Marx and William Bendix play two navy buddies, Benny Linn and Tim Dunnovan, who get a race horse that turns out to have a twin.They try to make a little money with the help of the twin horses.Chester Erskine's comedy A Girl In Every Port from 1952 isn't all that bad of comedy, if you ask me.It has got Groucho Marx in it, who can safe any movie.If course this doesn't reach near the classic stuff he did with his brothers Harpo and Chico, but he still gets to deliver some witty lines that safe a lot of this movie.William Bendix doesn't stay too much behind.He and Groucho make a great team.Marie Wilson plays Jane Sweet, a dumb blonde and isn't at all dumb in her role.Don DeFore does also good job as Bert Sedgwick.This movie may not be a masterpiece, but pretty good anyway.It made my Sunday afternoon a little better.
The second story "non-fiction" is not as painful but still is a joke.
Is political correctness just a big cover up for uncomfortable yet still very real desires and thoughts?
There are films that are far, far harder to watch... but this is still not one you put on to enjoy yourself.
Her American accent is pitch perfect, and while she isn't as good as she was in Atonement, she still gets the job done.
Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan is here still giving her best.
I also love how the filmmakers created an entirely plausible distant future where beauty still thrived despite crumbling infrastructure.
And i still think that was the performance that earned Ledger his Oscar.
Lots of other good stuff could be commented on, but let me just get back to my pronouncing it the best gay LOVE story told on screen; Even thought the character of Luke can be seen as only a projection of Jon's diagnosis as HIV positive (His way of coping with it as Scottie has to invent Madelaine in "Vertigo" facing death).... it still is a love story, sick as it may seem.
It also proves that the nature of the beast hasn't changed and that HIV/AIDs still isn't really a priority of the U.S. government...at least, not in any beneficial way to those afflicted.
Bugs is a famed pianist, the kind of fastidious virtuoso you still find today, but worshipped in the 40s because arrogant eccentricity somehow signalled class.
I still just love her, she is so likable.
It may not seem as original and maybe it isn't, but I am still thinking about it, 12 hours after I saw it and personally I think that is great in this era of popcorn films...  Other aspects that are part of a movie, like lightning and acting are really great!!
I couldn't have gone to the movies but every week I had in mind to see it and when I saw it at last there was many people and it continues for the same reason, people is still interested about this film.
It's a shame that the story is being clumbsy told, the movie has a bad flow, well not that bad but still enough to notice.
But the movie is still very see worthy, and I recommend this movie, it's not a oscar winning movie, but still.
I haven't seen this film since 1982 but I still remember it fondly.
The cinematography is not very good but I would still like to have this movie in my DVD collection.
It certainly lacks a certain rhythm, that I was tempted to compare to Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for... but it still is an undeniably good movie !
I know it's a real pain, but I still have to write 4 lines of this comment for it to be submittable.
But still I think there was something not very 'palpitant' about the movie: a certain slowness, a lack of suspense -I think- that I missed.
Regardless of how famous a director is, it is still a laborious exercise in lavishly fawning over and entertaining bureaucrats   2.
So, I guess while I chided the industry for their almost suicidal handling of foreign films, I do need to give them some credit for still letting us Americans, who don't mind reading subtitles, view them in their unedited glory.
After 2 1/2 hours of being bombarded with a World War II love-and-hate story that's both exciting and dragging, chances are you will be still pinned to your seat, anxious to find out how it ends.
I personally dislike the raw sexual scenes, however, the film is still a masterpiece!
But aside from that, it's still a really good movie.
By them, Ang Lee tells us he was once like them, and still is now, sending message to the audience through art, through culture, and with passion.
Thus, through minimal dialogue and character development, Ang Lee was able to depict Leung's character with great insight and accuracy, all the while reminding us that he was still human on some level.
I saw this movie yesterday and I'm still thinking about it.
I still love this film nevertheless, now that I am able to appreciate and articulate exactly why.
The opening sequence is still hauntingly beautiful, with the tracking shot from idyllic Disney forest to the gloomy castle's stained glass windows as the Alan Menken score smoothly segues in accordance with the changing visuals.
In fact, all the music in the film fits well with the visuals, and the songs are still quite catch.
The characters are not particularly complex (hence the "slight"-ness of the film), but are still pretty well-drawn.
Doctors are delving still further into how the brain works.
But, it still would be cool.
Are you more the the fun parts, you still won't be disappointed.
Beauty & the Beast is still one of my favourite Disney films.
It is still astounding to me that this is the only animated film to be nominated for best picture.
Like many other Disney films, I'm still impressed with this one after rediscovering it.
So, while not the greatest film in Disney history, it's still one not to be forgotten!
I hope someday we will see an animated movie win best picture, but sadly i think it will not happen, the only one in my opinion that came close was spirited away, and thats still no Beauty and the Beast.
In conclusion, I believe that this movie is one of the greatest ever made and I'm surprised it's not in IMDb's top 250 'cause it really should be, anyway, to all of you who still didn't get the chance to see it or thought that it was to silly and childish, believe me it's not, it's a true masterpiece.
Even with all of the animated films that have come since the release of Beauty, I am struck by the polished clarity of the animation in that the background and its objects remain completely in focus in proportion to the objects in the forefront, as critics are still astounded today that young Charles Foster Kane playing in the snow is able to remain in focus through a window in proportion to Agnes Moorhead in 'Citizen Kane.'
the animation was top notch: even now, after disney has had time to develop better computer animation techniques, it still has beautiful color and flow.
I've seen it many, many times, yet the ballroom scene still gives me goose bumps.
Youth Danny Embling (Noah Taylor) suffers the pain of learning his long -time favourite piece of crumpet is starting to expand her own social circle, leaving him still too slow in the growth cycle to keep in step.
Even though the young leading actors still have a lot to learn the movie has extraordinary supporting actors and also very good film editing and sound editing.
just like eating too much chocolate, still you won't regret about doing so.
Even though it was obvious that the relations between The Beatles themselves were then too strained, they still blasted the gray Liverpool sky with that album.
Even then, there is masses of stuff (even from Ringo) that's still way up there, especially from the 1970s.
Interesting to see how different he is with George on the bonus disc of the Beatles Anthology, yet GH still exhibits a wariness that hides lots of stuff I daresay will never now be known.
With all that said, it is an interesting look at how they could create wonderful music and still just goof off by playing songs they remembers from their youth.
The Beatles are still a very popular act (even though they haven't really performed together since 1970) and this movie helps to debunk the moptop myth and shows two and a half very creative musicians creating songs still that people still enjoy listening to.
You can tell from this movie why Paul McCartney still enjoys touring.
There was the joy of the fellowship of being a band, still, even whilst in the middle of a messy divorce.
You have to see Let It Be to understand how they could still make wonderful music together, and have fun doing it.
Depending on one's point of view and opinion of McCartney, he is either the one Beatle still trying to create magic, or a colossal pain in the ass.
Sure they argue, there are times when they seem to just "do nothing" and let the hours pass, but still, when they play...
I just watched this again and it occurred to me that it still works in 2007.
Second, it struck me as odd that they could accurately digitize human beings but they still shot the commercials on a real set.
Overall though it's still a solid and enjoyable flick.
The Rolling Stone review of the film from 9th July 1970 that I remember so well was typically over-reverential but had some telling points Â the first being how deliberately grainy the photography was which still can take some getting used to and that there was over 800 hours of footage from 4 cameras to edit down to the brief 80 minutes we got.
It all leads up to that rooftop concert that is still one of those big bad-ass moments in rock and roll history (if, again, not filmed with the best lenses or cameramen, it was perhaps a given that they had to shoot it on the fly).
Having never seen any VHS copies of this last Beatles movie and since it will probably be a very long time before it gets on DVD, I was stoked when I found out YouTube had this uploaded since the later part of summer 2007 and it was still there.
They were not at their best during the filming, but what is shown in the movie is still about the most fabulous thing ever to see.
They haven't yet figured out all the lyrics yet but it's still nice to hear any the songs in a unfinished stage.
You still want to insist that the film "shows the breakup of the Beatles"?
Nostalgia apart, it is impressive to see how this series was ahead of time and the time tunnel facility is still amazing and the story is not dated.
(Yes, I still have a copy of it on beta format) It is also kind of prophetic since the advancements in computer animation.
I was so happy to finally see an independent movie that wasn't prententious, but still smart enought to take the audience on a journey without talking down to it.
still it is quite entertaining.
The film benefits from a strong Italian cast, including Maurizio Merli; who may be no Clint Eastwood, but still delivers a strong and entertaining lead performance.
He still has some- however rare- sound opinions but he sure as hell ain't open minded and generally focuses on increasing the current smokescreen put up by this dirty white house.
It was shot on tri-exposure Technicolor with the lighting a bit flat but, all in all, a loving tribute to the era complete with many of the top song hits of the time, some that are still celebrated today, in the 21st Century.  
I still think of this, one of his first movies, as his best.
In this case, the male lead is actually the son of the original sheik, but Valentino also plays, just as engagingly, the father who is now middle aged, wiser (this is essentially the adviser role Adolphe Menjou had in the original movie) but still commanding and able to wield a sword.
Fox was still well-taken with their new CinemaScope process that just begged for action and beautiful, colorful settings.
There are a few interesting characters, and a few people show that they have acting potential, and if you get into the frame of mind where you can deal with all the large amounts of shiny computer game cgi, then there is still the problem that the movie just sucks anyways.
This is still something that does not deserve to be watched twice, maybe not even once.
CGI is still something you would be proud of if you got it out of your own computer.
I sat down to watch this expecting a b movie, not great but one that was still entertaining - I didn't get that, I watched it with a friend of mine and we didn't talk to each other for half an hour after it finished simply because we were in shock at how bad it was.
I suspect there still are quite a few people like him out there.
But still, this movie never becomes really boring, 'cause the CGI frequently provides nice images to look at, with the 'cave-exploring'-sequence being a good example (nice glowing flubbery creatures).
And even if it can't compete with most of the underwater-creature-flicks, it still is way better than that Casper Van Dien SHARK ATTACK-tripe.
Anything was possible, Korea had not yet erupted, and there was still a homey and "gee wiz" attitude towards the future.
The story would be painfully predictable with no random elements if it wasn't for the presence of Joe Â the credits pretty much tell us everything about both the good and the bad (Blick for instance is a "stool pigeon and frame-up artist") and so perhaps I should have expected for things to turn out in a somewhat less than usual manner but I was still taken somewhat by surprise simply because the style of the film had lulled me into a state of acceptance.
And, although on the surface everything is resolved in the end, there are still a lot of questions one asks.
THE TIME OF YOUR LIFE is a pleasant play, and still gets revived, but it is a lesser work for the stage.
The relationship is written very effectively due to it being exaggerated to the point that the audience are prepared to believe that this woman will still love a genetically mutating man.
"The Fly," like "The Phantom of the Opera" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," shows us a monster who is reduced to a grotesque (and in the case of Brundle, inhuman) appearance, while still endowed with the bare instincts of love, morality, and fear; under increasingly heavy makeup, Goldblum retains his trademark sardonic wit, but it connects with a plaintive sorrow that is truly affecting.
The special effects were brilliant and still are to this day.
Cronenberg, of course, never shortchanges his audience with graphic gore, and even viewed with the critical eye of Generation Y, the film's mid-eighties effects are still quite sickening, none more so than Goldblum's slow physical transformation.
David Cronenberg's version of "The Fly" has little in common with Kurt Neumann's 1958 film of the same title, one of the cheaply made 'creature-features' of the 1950sÂ Instead, it reveals many of the director's obsessionsÂ   Jeff Goldblum is Seth Brundle, a Mad Scientist who is working on 'teleporting', a means of transporting objects through spaceÂ Geena Davis is Veronica Quaife, a magazine writer who becomes interested in his work, and in himÂ They start an affair, but Seth believes Veronica is still seeing her former loverÂ In a rage he tries to transport himself, and his genes become caught up with a fly that gets into the machineÂ Slowly Seth takes on the features of an insectÂ   As in other Cronenberg's films, sexuality is seen as a dangerous force that leads to disasterÂ Seth cannot get his amazing machine to transport living creatures until he has experienced the delights of sex with Veronica, but then almost immediately his jealousy leads more like a fly he develops a raging libido; the more physically repulsive he is, the more he wants sexÂ   Like many successful films of the 1980s, "The Fly" is a hybrid, fusing elements of both horror and science fictionÂ Considering that the plot is from the latter genre, the elements of fear and disgust with the human body are traditional to horrorÂ Both genres, as this film will illustrate, benefited greatly from the increasing sophistication of contemporary special effects technique, and the make-up abilitiesÂ The success of the film led to sequel in 1989, in which the son of Seth and Veronica begins to display familiar symptomsÂ
It's been over 20 years since this movie was made, but the special effects are still amazing and the story is an entertaining - and disgusting - as ever!
The special effects, mainly created by Chris Walas (who went on directing the 1989-sequel) are definitely still staggering and they don't look the least bit dated by today's standards.
Yes, imagination & inspiration do still live & are still the main ingredients of REAL ART!!!
He is mesmerizing as he delivers great dialogue and once he's barely recognizable he still breaks through the makeup and you can feel the human inside.
Another commenter notes that de Havilland's role was wasted on her, and I agree, but she still turns in a great performance.
He is still ever so charming but this time he has traded his sword for a desk.
The screwy cleverness is pretty obvious, but it's still funny.
If Hollywood still had the capacity to produce quality films like this, motion pictures would see another Golden Age.
She still seems like an old witch, but this time around I felt her belief in the supernatural and understood her fears which she passed along to the general who had been brought up with the same superstitions.
In "Isle of the Dead" he is never someone we are allowed to identify with, but he still manages to make us understand his every action.
"Isle of the Dead" might not be a classic, it certainly is still a fine example of '40's horror.
It also has more on screen violence than most Lewton films but it still manages to play with the audience's emotions and imagination.
I'm still not quite sure what I saw in Isle of the Dead.
Its central situation - that of a stranded group of people fighting the elements (in this case, the plague) and a dangerous enemy (the vampire-like Vorvoloka who saps their energies) - has been done to death since, but at the time it was still relatively fresh (and may well have been inspired by John Ford's classic Western STAGECOACH [1939], especially in the way the heroine is shunned by some members for her 'corrupting influence').
Samuel L Jackson delivers a worthy performance as Jack, adding his signature personality to the role while still maintaining the spirit of the character.
It still burns the hell out of me that Best Buy carries this DVD while Equilibrium was no where to be found.
This movie shows that good noir still can be made and their time has not passed yet
And in which America is it possible for a man to become prosecutor in spite of a highly publicized and proved close friendship with a mob guy, and even get elected governor in spite of not only still being pals with the mob guy but marrying his former girl?!
All others will still probably enjoy it, but might also find the plot elements a bit hard to believe.
Recommended, but please don't judge it by the first 20 minutes which are rather slow-moving, but still entertaining.
As much as I adore Christian Bale, it was still hard to watch because it was pretty much, a boring movie.
I loved the book and I still cannot believe that Astrid Lindgren sold the rights to these filmmakers (she later made the same mistake with the animated Pippi Longstocking).
The setting was still okay and the underlying themes are wonderful (father-son, friendship, courage, love etc).
I'm 22 now and I still love the film that much, I'm actually watching it right now.
Maybe it's a little predictable, still absolutely worth watching it.
I loved it from the moment I first watched it, and even now, at nineteen, it's still one of my favorite movies.
This is still my favorite of Christian Bale's many roles, and among my favorite Christopher Lee roles (the man has over 700, so it's hard to pick faves sometimes ^_^).
But for an open minded viewer like me, it still failed to interest.
Regardless, BAD GUY is still a strong film if you're in the mood for a serious drama, but want something different then the regular U.S. theatrical garbage that's out there...7.5/10
However,ABC still aires these classics to this day,on a annual basis.
But getting back to "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving",there is one thing that I got to say about this special presentation....it is a bonafide classic that still holds up some 30 years later.
Basically, the movie tells 5 different stories,which interact with each other, but still follow their own story.
Well what can you say... just witnessed this spectacle ... completely crazy...yet still manages to have depth.
There is so much more than Ghost stories and Miike takashi (he is still amazing mind)... invest in Survival Style 5+... it makes Tarantino look like Renny Harlin
A young group of miscreants thieving neighborhood houses while still entertaining those watching the movie with their humorous conversations, and relationships between the trio.
Even when you watching this film a second time you still might get lost in figuring out all these details.
Several days after viewing the movie, I still find myself walking down the street, remembering a funny scene or line, and laughing wildly to myself about it.
Of course, Brown hits it in horrible places, behind trees, in ditches, buried in sand traps, etc., but Jones shows how he still manages to get the ball not only on the green but near the hole, out of their almost-impossible conditions.
There's plenty of archetypal King Vidor composition-in-frame that's still imitated today, and in many instances the lighting is exemplary of the gorgeous black & white textural artistry of Hollywood's Golden Age.
this film showed this cynic that romance can still work on the big screen.
Acting is perfect and I still can't get over the fact it didn't win an Oscar for best foreign film.
I am an only child to divorced parents and very rarely had friends as I was and still am very much a loner.
Even today I enjoy solitude far more than the company of most people and still use my imagination to think of stupid little things.
And I still say I'll marry her one day.
`Amelie' is the first film where I adored the subtitles and in fact, had a nagging urge to go out and learn French that is still with me today.
For you who think you never heard of him before he is actually the same man who brought us "Alien 4" back in 1997, (I still refuse to believe he was involved in that horrible film...), and the wonderful "Delicatessen" in 1991.
Long after the CG thrills of hyped fantasy movies and big budget Hollywood productions have faded and been forgotten, Amelie will still be jumping around in my heart, doing all those silly and charming little things I wish I dared to do too...
Norman Wooland plays the wealthy, upstanding young man who courts Todd while she is still carrying on an affair with Desny.
Most historians believe the woman was guilty of the crime, as she certainly was in possession of arsenic in the weeks leading up to her lover's death, but Lean chooses to direct in a detached manner, and by the film's end we are still pondering "Did she or didn't she?".
This movie was somewhat of a disappointment, but overall, I still give it my approval.
When compared to other 3rd installments of trilogies, it still is up there with the best.
The reason this silent film is still viewed today and enjoyed, is simply because the director of this film was Sidney Franklin who was a very famous director during the 20's 30's and 40's.
(This is sort of like the late comedian George Carlin's famous routine comparing baseball to football; be warned, I still pick baseball.)
Nevertheless, I was still moved at the end.
The last film screened at the festival, Little Erin Merryweather, renews the hope that creativity is still flourishing in the independent film world.
Regardless of its originality, I still thought it could be a cool idea.
In the end, ignoring all of the poor technical aspects of the film, it's still watchable and may be enjoyable to fans of the normal 'teen/college' (though many were way, WAY above teen and only pretending to be young) slasher flicks.
I mean, we saw the killer's face numerous times, and yet we were still supposed to be trying to figuring out a mystery?
Even if you're not a horror freak like my boyfriend, you should still check it out because it is different and very creative.
Obviously this movie would have been terrible without the attractive women, but it was still very entertaining.
I was suppose to believe that they did all this running around, with their stilettos still intact.
I can't sit still to watch many movies.
This is the first Egyptian movie that has a very high propaganda by all advertising means as well as the first Egyptian movie that has been awarded in Tribeca Film Festival & participated in Berlinale & Cannes 2006 & still may be have a chance in the 2007 Oscars in the best foreign Film Category .
stay still"!!
The rise of Islamic fundamentalism, homosexuality, the poor treatment of women in contemporary Egyptian society, the rampant corruption, still powerful strict class system.
I am still reeling from the dizzying marvel of the grand storytelling of this movie.
"We are living in the age of deformity" said one of the characters... and so mankind still continues, forming, deforming, renewing itself.
Anyway, he's still a newbie (this is his first film), so he'll probably give better performances in the future.
Rasheed isn't mincing, but he reflects an Egyptian discomfort with gayness; still, he's seen three-dimensionally.
I'm curious to see if it will still affect me so strongly.
In both these films Cagney was in his early 50s, being born in 1899 but still believable as a character.
Although not up to the high standards of his previous work in "White Heat" the year before, "Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye" is still a worthy follow-up for James Cagney.
You could see he was starting to get a little pudgy in the midsection and gray around the temples for that kind of role, but he still pulled it off.....big-time.
When our "hero" accidentally witnesses a murder take place and begins fantasizing about the crime-scene, he decides to play private-dick (literally)...   A CLIMAX OF BLUE POWER is one of those rare 70s era porn films that actually relies on storyline and a bit of decent acting to carry the film, while still maintaing it's grimy porno atmosphere.
It is a pity that society still looks down and snubs their noses at hardcore cinema, for if this cinematic medium were to ever be accepted,surly films like this would become recognized as the masterpieces they are.
If you ever wondered what sort of movies Ed Wood would be making, would he still be alive today, all you have to do is pick up any random Jesus Franco movie.
I must say though that I still enjoy watching older Franco movies better than the newer ones, that he is still making this present day and age.
At least these movies still had a bit of style over them and got shot at location instead of in a studio or in the garden of one of the cast-members.
Having said all that, this is still one of my top 10 Franco films, which to be fair says a whole lot more about his other films than it does this one as it's at best only decidedly average!
), especially when you consider the movie Franco was rehashing here was 'Tombs of the Blind Dead' - itself a (great) movie which would never have existed had Romero not redefined the zombie, moved it into modern times and made it into what it still is today!
It basically just sounds like sour grapes, as Romero had something which still eludes Franco today - an idea!
A solemn, sombre echo from an era since long lost, which after the forgetful ravages of time still can like the bird of Phoenix rise from the ashes of oblivion to once again let its plumage shine with unprecedented respectability.
He gave me my one and only flight in a single engined monoplane - a Miles Master - and I still recall that experience with great pleasure.
Then, maybe, you will reach - like me - the feeling of real, possible, non-pathetic hope, that in core we are still humans... and this state of mind can help one much to live in this world.
i think this film was confusing and had a bad plot.Shannen did OK in this but not as well as she normally does.i found it hard to follow the whole story and found it quite boring and didn't enjoy it till bout half way but i didn't enjoy it much i would say not the best of films i have watched with her in :l what was the point of this story and what was the plot  I've seen Shannen in better in other films i was very disappointed when i finished watching this cause it wasn't what i expected i would I've this film a bad review of 3 out of 10 Shannen is still the best actress in the world and she can act whoever put that comment that she cant she just isn't good in that 1
The whole thing with Royd's "mother" was badly handled - in the book, she was sinister and creepy, terrifying and powerful, here she's kinda creepy and somehow pathetic, instead of tragic and still sympathetic as she is in the book.
I've only seen it once, yet I still remember it, and thanks to IMDb, I finally found the info on it.
Until then, I still fondly give it a 10.
According to this film the planes that hit the World Trade Center were not the planes we were told, that a missile hit the Pentagon, flight 93 was shot down, that some or all of the planes were off loaded and the people may still be alive, the collapse of the twin towers was the work of demolition not the crashes, and that there is some grand conspiracy behind it all.
Why are they still all there?
At least these guys are still asking the questions that have been left unanswered.
Even though Dylan, Jason and Korey claim that they have spent 3 years researching 9/11, they still got a lot of facts wrong:  1.
The creatures themselves (the women in alien form) moved a bit oddly/unrealistically, but that's something that big-budget movies still have problems with, from time to time.
Are you going to believe that a college kid is still flirting with a space alien after he's seen tentacles?
It's not going to win an academy award, but it still made us laugh... a lot.
To be fair the film looks pretty nice with slick production values & better than average but still nothing brilliant CGI computer effects.
It's clear to see who the lead players are and even though you know who's gonna go, you still root for them like they have a chance, something you don't see too often.
But for most of the action sequences the creatures are CGI but even though it's easy to tell, it still looks good since they move so fast.
This movie also mixes in a bit of cop drama with the good cop bad cop showdown, although unnecessary it still seems to work in the entire B-Movie atmosphere of the rest of the movie.
Not the worst I've seen, but this was still extremely bad!
But I still enjoyed it, simply because I enjoy this type of movie.
Okay, I can certainly admit that the plot isn't original, and that things get predictable on more than a few occasions, but I still thought that this was a great movie.
So, even though this movie takes us through some familiar territory, I still thought it was a lovely ride.
With naturalism out of the question, pros like Fredric March, Betty Field & Agnes Moorehead all succumb to heightened stage manners, but they still can't pull off the simplistic humanistic psychological ending.
Without him, they would never have become the people they are, so to see them end up with nothing, while he is still rich isn't satisfactory at all.
This was a film that got a rather high score in the Leonard Maltin Guide--saying the film was "still potent".
Not getting the hint that he was a total wash out, in him not having what it takes to be a good Nazi, from his beloved Nazi Germany Emil ,because of him being brainwashed since he could barley walk, still thinks that he's a full fledged Nazi Superman and goes so far as to parade around the house, this in 1944 when the US was at war with Nazi Germany, with his Nazi or Hitler Youth uniform.
Though it's now been 24 years since I saw it, I still remember thinking that I should have walked out of the theater.. No one in the audience laughed even once.
But why do I still have this weird notion that I quite enjoyed it?
This had all the gore you need, maybe it could of had more, but still has a bloody edge, and the effects wern't all the terrible, even though towards the end when the woman is being grabbed by her hair when she's hanging off the Lighhouse does look a little bit stupid.
still gets major points for at least attempting a subject matter few films of its era, outside of propaganda newsreels, would dare touch, and it's worth a watch.
If you are still only on the sideline not sure to continue or not after watching episode 3, then you should probably stop watching (really unthinkable to me but I suppose it is possible).
By the way, the China edition in the green box has bonus materials of interview with some of the cast members as well as the last 7 days of filming -- even though there is no English subtitle on the bonus materials, it was still quite enjoyable to see how the cast looked in "modern" attire and their reaction to the questions!
This is a movie that has a dated look, but still makes an impression because of the strength of the treatment it received from the writers and the director.
If Sir William Scott was still alive, I think that he would of been very proud.
Everyone knows the film inside out but are still watching it year after year; fills in on every funny line (like when de Boeuf shouts "Striiip him!
Ivanhoe: A nice experience for a romantic fan  This was a TV-movie I liked when I was a child, I still think it is okay, but maybe not a realistic end battle between Brian and Wilfred, and the same with the make up, some of the costumes and hair styles.
I don't know if I would still think this movie was worth 8 or not.
I enjoyed the early-70s touches (shag carpeting in the bathroom, 8-track cassettes) but realized that -- despite so many advances in gay rights over the years -- it could almost be re-made today and still make sense.
I think I still have a crush on Martin Sheen in his turtleneck sweater.
They still go here and there at the drop of a hat.
Okay, cliched already, but maybe it could still manage, right?
And finally, we have the biggest annoyance of all...why did Butt Chin still pull that fast one on J.K. and get poor Matt fired when all he had to do was time-travel back to before he gave the demo and tell his past self to never give it?
As a standalone, without MST, this film is still one of the funniest things American cinema has left in a steaming pile on the sidewalk.
I don't care what they call it, it's still powered by a Comodore 64.
Oh well, I still like this movie.
A little more competent than most films that are shown, it's still pretty bad.
The question that still bugs me is, where did that gun come from?
What ever they said, they still ended up making a really bad movie--dull story, bad script, lame acting, poor cinematography, bottom of the barrel stock music, etc.
