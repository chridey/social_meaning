The only movie i can think of right now, that is worse than Zombiegeddon is probably Zombiez.
Wow--this is one strange and inspired comedy that is so unlike any other I can think of!
Perhaps he was warning Hollywood about the danger in beauty plastic surgery that is getting out of hand.
But then comes the 'women's fight for man' except here one woman is just looking for 'immortality' (as many have put it) and that is basically the only part in which it differs from other movies.
Not many worth watching, that is.
In Death Becomes Her Robert Zemeckis brings in a cast extraordinaire to a film that is fresh in ideas and verging on poetic in its writing.
The add-on promised to invoke the mood of the final days of the empire and the early middle ages, the period that is the subject of Gibbons book, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.
In fact, The things that goes on in this series' cartoons are in My opinion action packed which that is what makes the show good.
Lynch captures a vampire that is cultured, charismatic, vulnerable, and still human.
But the real reason I'm writing is because I would really appreciate some help to find the name of another vampire film I can't stop thinking about: all I remember about it is that is was in B&W (or maybe it was just my TV, I can't remember) I recall only two scenes: one, there was like a parade and there was this woman who looked very much like a nun, and the vampire grabbed her and sucked her blood inside of a car, and everyone who saw them laughed 'cause they thought they were making out.
Seven Murders for Scotland Yard is pretty much your standard Giallo fare, and that is no bad thing!
You can decide for yourself whether that is a good thing or a bad thing.
Loretta Young is supposedly lovely in this film -- if you like her, that is.
Big Davey increasingly frustrated at the influence of his fur hunter friend Jim Fairways(Robert Mitchum) decides his son needs a woman's influence around the house and sets off to the local stockade to find a wife much to the protestations of little Davey who doesn't want anyone to replace his recently deceased mother.Big Davey is recommended a bonds girl Rachel(Loretta Young )who is surplus to requirements and he buys her for 18 dollars.Both of the Harveys are cold and distant towards their new family member and treat her as the slave she is, until that is the charismatic Jim Fairways arrives and treats her like a queen,they hit it off straight away much to the jealousy of Big Davey who is just not ready for love yetÂ.
this triggers a battle of wills to win the heart of RachelÂand just to add to their problems the film is set against a backdrop of continuing raids by rogue Shawnee Indians on the local homesteads.This is truly a forgotten western classic that still feels very fresh today,Rachel and the Stranger is very very charming film,that is also very funny and has a simple but intelligent script,on top of that add three truly Epic performances by the three leads and an action packed finale and you have a wonderful film.
), the film presents a dimension of the country, in fact the continent, that is hard to fathom otherwise.
The Indian sex scenes are interesting, that is something that is not often depicted, the freedom of their sexuality.
And that is exactly right!
It's an absolute privillege to have watched 3 hours of comedy, excitement, sadness & a quite brilliant portrayal of WW1, that is Blackadder series 4.
A scraping by man that is one step away from Adam in implements scratching out a living suddenly comes by an ailing pregnant woman who he befriends and keeps alive by stretching the tight shoestring he's already living on, taut to its limit.
The Netflix blurb prepared me for a depressing experience, but I came away with a sense that I had spent a few years in a world that is thousands of miles and hundreds of years from my own.
A film that is for actors and people who get it... not for the masses(may think it moves slow).
Most horror is pop out scares, or slashers, but this movie is among the few that is genuinely creepy.
THE ORPHANAGE is a refreshing horror movie that is pretty unconventional.
The Orphanage is film that is intelligently made and will go on to become a definitive horror film, much in the same way as Jacobs Ladder, Don't Look Now, Rosemary's Baby and The Sixth Sense Â all films that carry similar themes.
In fact, I think they both share the same message, that is, that helping those most in need of help gives life meaning.
However, the explanation of the mystery in the end makes this sensitive movie actually a drama, and not horror genre, and maybe that is the reason why some viewers have written bad reviews (or maybe they have not understood the plot).
A smashingly engaging film that is in the vein of Robert Wise's The Haunting & Alejandro AmenÃ¡bar's The Others, so if you like real well told ghost stories that unhinge rather than shock you, get in the queue because El Orfanato is a real pleasure.
A solid old-fashioned ghost story that is genuinely frightening without resorting to lashings of gore or cheap shocks, The Orphanage is the best horror film of 2007 so far and certainly shows Hollywood the true definition of suspense after the laughable '1408'.
So usually I only see the big horror classics, and that is because I've read enough spoilers to confront the movie in a laid-back way.
There is no camera art and no first grade performances, but I doubt that is what anyone going into this film expects.
Its been a while since I've commented on IMDb, the only excuse I have for that is that no film in the past year or two has moved me, or even made me want to comment at all on here.
Unlike these later short productions, Wild Orchid 2 succeeds in involving the viewer in a story that is sufficiently disturbing to provide genuine emotional impact.
who are dying of starvation in a wealthy household that is occupied by an assemblage of real shady characters including a mean chauffeur in black, an abrasive housekeeper, a bad doctor with a weird eye twitch, and the mother who proudly proclaims she's a "dipsomaniac".
Not only is Picardo such a great actor but the premise setting for his expansive, self growth, as a doctor, self realization now that is science fiction at its best!
Maybe that is why her son disappeared-because he was bored with his life & his wife.
This is a film that is slow in developing but not without losing its grip.
There's no dramatic closure, the viewer is unsure of the ending, but that is as it should be.
In that scene, we see again that she just can't accept it because the body that is found has all the characteristics of her missing husband, but she still denies that it is her husband.
Indeed that is what made the movie so convincing to me.
The main character displays a depth of emotion that is not often seen in this genre managing to convey in word and memory induced vignettes the tragedy of his life, the wrongs he has committed to survive and his sorrow at what he has become.
Anyway There is a part where the ass**** teacher is playing a blues type jam, and had said he hates it when a student is better then him, well it seams that is easy cause he sucks, he had no licks, no soul and no vibrato...then the film seams to play him up as the "mentor" when your ear can tell you he blows.... what grounds then does he have for yelling at the kids, when his own playing fails to impress..The one kid I hope keeps rocking is the 12 year old who at the end plays a amazing solo, kids got it....(teacher don't) thats all oh yeah, most adults who act like the butt monkey teacher end up profiled as weird........aside from the yelling I act the same way its fine, however I play a meaner blues and I am not as much of a honker as said butt monkey....Ps I know my grammar sucks, then again this is not about me........Peace movie fans M.Run
It's about Arnie and his troops....heading into the jungle to rescue some hostages....well turns out they have something that is hunting them...a alien that likes to hunt and collect skulls as trophies.
The other thing that is established during this material is the way the team is really one unit.
My only wish that didn't come true is for a better sequel, that is a different story.
An Action Sci-fi movie with action scenes that are believable (humanly possible) but still with a mysterious, powerful alien that is slowly developed from a computer generated wispy creature to a real and frightening being.
The sequel worked as a comic-book-style creature feature but the original "Predator" is a much better film than most people give it credit for, being the rare smart action film that is solidly constructed and worth watching far more than just once.
It looked slightly fake in Pred 2(Not a bad film too) and don't get me started on the travesty that is AvP.
Predator was released hot on the heels of the success of James Cameron's amazing 'Aliens' - but don't be thinking this film is merely a rip off following a trend, Predator has more than enough up it's sleeve to ensure that isn't the case.
At times he's cringe-worthy, but it's hard to deny his prowess when it comes to the action sequences, and that is all a film of this nature needs.
Here we have an extra terrestrial that isn't merely trying to breed, or to 'phone home' - but one that is actually there to hunt humans for sport!
This is a sci-fi action movie that isn't just full of cheap explosions.
The Brits have crafted a story that is compelling, interesting to look at, complete with the supernatural, and, with a shoe string of a budget, something quite believable.
It is a travesty with all of the crap movies and TV that is produced to lose this show called Hex that is so refreshing in the land of crap TV such as One tree Hill, Pepper Dennis, and pretty much all of the other shows being produced for TV!!!
"Buffy" was a slave to the episodic nature of TV, whereas "Hex" sheds that skin and creates an experience that is nearly cinematic.
Some people seem put off by the "tough love" thing that is part of the instruction but it seemed to me that the only time he got impatient was when it was obvious that certain kids weren't trying their hardest.
Then I found out that is was actually a series that had ended in the UK in 2004.
Even though nothing much happens in the movie that is really profound, you feel like you are rewarded by watching because you get to know the characters, especially Tommy, played by Buschemi.
There are a number of notable supporting performances in this film, as well, beginning with Mark Boone Junior, who as Mike captures the essence of a guy who is successful, but a loser nonetheless; LaPaglia, who gives a solid performance as Rob; Bracco, with a performance that is introspectively revealing; Debi Mazar, who with very little screen time leaves an indelible impression (and her eyes are absolutely mesmerizing); Kevin Corrigan (another of the finest character actors around), as Matthew; and especially Chloe Sevigny, as Debbie, Theresa's mature-beyond-her-years, seventeen-year-old niece.
This is a story that is hard to tell, let alone find an audience.
It is a movie that will bring you moments of extreme horror, sadness and tears with a realism that is rarely seen in movies today, and it is a movie that will leave you with open eyes and your head spinning.
Soon, war and anger overcomes and all that is left is the "Savior".
its a wonderful continuation of the pop series and presents a befitting end to the series.The prince looks great as ever and the various new features which are present in this game add an extra spice to it.The speed kill system is wonderful and makes the job quite easy for the prince,also in this game i cant recall a single instant where the game presented bad camera angles as are present in the previous two games.The game play is although pretty much similar to the previous two games but the platforming in this one is really great.There is one more added attraction in this game that is chariot racing which is quite nail biting stuff.Also in this game there aren't any monotonous boss fights as were in the pop warrior within.All in all a wonderful gaming experience,a must play for everyone and i give it a well deserved 9.5/10.
Pure brilliant, that is.
This guy obviously has talent in spades and manages to create something that is visually stunning and exciting but that also carefully defines real characters and emotion.
Second time it is instead Hallman that is fatally wounded, and this time Winston steals the time machine, although he doesn't know what it is.
For the love of all that is good, go rent Donny Darko and stay far away from the abomination known as Slipstream.
This entry certainly has a much different feel than the original BASKET CASE, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing.
The original "Basket Case" is one of my top favorite 80s cult films ever - just a bizarre idea that is strengthened by a great grimy New York city look and "feel", as well as awesome gore - and "part 2", though it was made about 8 years after it's predecessor, picks up right after the "dramatic" plummet from the Hotel Broslin.
The freaks are truly over-the-top - one having a giraffe-like neck, another with a crescent shaped head, a face full of noses, and there's even one that is just a giant mouth.
An experience that would trigger an obsession for (almost) all that is B-cinema.
The Puppet Masters is a very good alien film.Donald Sutherland was good and it was unusual for male lead by Eric Thal.Julie Warner acted good and looked great!Will Patton's role was very different.Richard Belzer was the same as always and Marshal Bell was good but I was kinda disappointed by the role they gave to Yaphet Kotto as he didn't do much.The music is great!The Puppet Masters is a good alien film that is action packed and is never boring!I think all fans of alien films will like this!
This is one of the few sequels that is actually better than the original.
Rent this along with the original "Basket Case", "Frankenhooker" and "Brain Dead" (Not the Peter Jackson movies that is a/k/a "Dead Alive") and enjoy a Hennenlotter triple bill.
'Renegade' belongs to the classic series, a original story that is well carried out by fine actors who really are fit to do so, Reno Raines/ aka Vince Black is a great character, always looking for justice with his own unique style...
I give it a 8 out of 10 star rating for it and that is entirely justified, no matter what others say...
After he survives an 'accident' that is believed by everyone as an attempted suicide, his mother asks his father to take care of him.
This is one of those movies that is just simply enjoyable to watch.
It is one of my favourites and it takes me away to a fantasy place - I have not taken drugs but I imagine that this is what is would be like .It is a fantasy world of warmth and seduction , bright and shiny coupled with building site realism and everyday feelings .You truly suspend realism and that is what films are supposed to be about .If you are looking to escape for a couple of hours , watch this
I recommend this film to those who have not seen it not as a film that is extraordinary, but one which encourages viewers to introspect and look at ordinary lives, not of superheroes but of less than perfect men and women.
If that isn't enough, the place is about to have a huge premiere for the owners film.
The first hour is that collection of stories, and the final thirty minutes is the madness that is Coffin Joe running rampant in the nightmarish realm of these four selected "victims".
seem to operate on a logic all their own, that is, the logic of Mr. Marins himself, and while I can't say much about truly understanding what's going on in most cases, they do make for a fascinating watch.
It is such cases that prove that jury justice is maybe good in many cases but there are a few cases where it is the worst possible system, and that is why the death penalty should be gotten rid of, and that's why we should make sure the defendants, now sentenced culprits, have access to all possibilities and opportunities to appeal the decision and to have the best councilors available.
Jury justice in a world that is so deeply cut in small antagonistic pieces does not work in any sensitive delicate case because of any kind of un-namable bias having to do with race, wealth, age, sex, sexual orientation, and any other parameter you may think of.
I won't even go so far as to say that Michael Peterson didn't murder his wife, because after all I wasn't present at the trial (and even that isn't always a guarantee for justice) and I've only been offered this material in the form of a documentary (by French film maker Jean-Xavier de Lestrade) of about 6 hours.
in my mind this is a fluffy,light movie,but very entertaining and fun to watch.Basically,John Wayne is stranger in town who agrees to help the men get a new road built.the workers have been continually threatened and harassed or worse,by a gang of outlaws who don't want the road built.there is no law to speak of in the town,so the gang has pretty much done whatever they please.until now,that is.this is a pretty standard western movie,which follows the general formula of westerns at that time.however,i think it it is well acted,exciting and fast paced.it's a pretty short movie(less than 90 minutes)but there'a lot jammed into the short running time.if you're in the mood to simply be entertained,you might like this movie.it's not an epic,like many of John Wayne's movies,but so what.i think "rainbow Valley" is a strong 8/10
A decent film that is head and shoulders above other Chaplin films of the time, though awfully crude when compared to his films just a few years later.
GREAT SONGS, and I even cried when the fat black gril sang a song to express to her angry dad that she is fat and that is who she is.
Oh, and, for a film that is supposed to be gay positive, how come the main character is the only straight boy in the entire movie?
At the same time, along with all of the misery and oppression that is documented, there are stories included that are deeply inspiring.
Bottom line: Sucks except for a drag part that is pretty funny.
He does a character based on Tony Montana from Scarface that is hilarious!
There isn't a single scene that isn't embarrassing.
If you are forced to watch this film, that is probably the only time you should waste watching it.
However, I think this film has a strike against it from the outset and that is because the CARS characters aren't as endearing or timeless as many of the other Pixar creations.
The biggest problem is that we, the audience that is, are always fully aware of who the Werewolf is so there's no mystery or intrigue element & watching Charlie, Derek & Sam trying to figure it out is rather tedious & one might say unnecessary as we already know.
But for my money the obvious reason is that this game has been well developed, probably game tested over and over to bring a game that is satisfying and bug free.
I always thought that john Cassevetes is a little overrated because I've never seen him display a personality that is incredibly enjoyable(even with Rosemary's baby) and in this movie he was his usual negotiating boring self.
Occasionally there will be something that isn't directed quite well enough even when something interesting is going on.
(and yes,The Fury borrows form Carrie,another DePalma film.in fact some of the sequences in Scanners were nearly identical to those in the Fury,but were actually not as graphic.i think The Fury is actually a superior film.Amy Irving is terrific,and steals the show.the supporting cast is also good,with Kirk Douglas,Carrie Snodgress,John Cassavetes,Andrew Stevens,and Fiona Lewis.Charles Durning also has a small role.an unrecognizable Melody Thomas Scott(Nikki Newman from the long running soap The Young and the Restless)also has what amounts to a cameo.but it's Dennis Franz in his very brief appearance that is hysterical in a bit of comic relief performance.as for the movie itself,if you have a weak stomach or don't like horror films,i suggest you avoids this.but if you like being scared,pop this in late at night for maximum effect.my vote for The Fury is a 9/10 P.S.
that is evoked by a great, rich vision (De Palma's).
Losing the direct Hitchcockian references, De Palma applies a harder, leaner style to the storytelling and creates a powerful work that is less fun than his later films, but no less compelling.
This ambitious film travels from the Middle East to Chicago in a tale of intrigue and super natural forces that is incomprehensible, at times.
It comes second to Arrested Development for me, and that is the only show that I would ever rate 10/10.
But that is what makes it so funny.
Steiger is subtle yet everything he does that is in any way connected to escaping his dumb captors is hilarious: the way he touches the soldier's rifle, the manner in which he dashes away with the cow bell attached to his neck... Priceless.
But that is just nit-picking.
This is a great film that is worth renting whether you are a girl or a guy.
Watch out for a bit of rough language and sexual conversation, if that is important to you.
This play should be at the peak of viewing assignments for all students of what TV can really do and be in a democracy that is real, not just a convenient platitude.
that is, we have little to no idea of what they do when they're not horsing about, making out, or talking about how much of a strain their relationship is to the both of them.
There is also a great amount of communication that isn't purely driven by dialogue and it's exceptional between the two main players.
Most locations are pretty "awful" by today's viewing habits but that is the exact charm of this movie as opposed to all the slick and sterile over-produced forgettable comedies of today.
This could very well be remade but I doubt people today want to see anyone on the screen who is over 40 years old... And that is pathetic.
Looking back at this film and when it was released (1999 in the USA) it is startling that the sexual repression that is so prevalent in the film, can still exist in this day and age.
This intensity clouds what is really happening to them.The only way they can express honesty to each other is for the boys to reach for some booze, that is the only way some very painful truths will surface.
He could of said something to them, but that is easier said than done.
It is how you treat them, and that is with respect and decency.
But if you try to take it any deeper, then you'd have to consider the internal struggles of John Dixon, the object of Steven's desire, because that is one of the few places in this movie where something is at stake.
And that is a shame, because if there ever was reason to give up everything for love, Ben Silverstone would be it.
A contemporary classic that is highly recommended.
It has near no relation to the original Class of Nuke Em High, but that is okay.
We're also presented with a scene that is tiny, remote and claustrophobic, with drag queens at the bottom of a rigid internal hierarchy, everyone's on the skids, and dykes are harpies from another planet.
A digital independent feature that is more ambitious than most Hollywood products these days.
Another thing that is essential for a Mills and Boon man is that if he is going to get into a fight he should win.
But many of those interviewed had peripheral roles at best and have little to say that is insightful or interesting.
I am engaged to a woman that is ten years older than me, (I am 22.
Written, co-produced & directed by Richard Shepard I thought Oxygen was a nice tight, taut little thriller that isn't the sort of thing I usually like but it has a certain something about it.
The plot does have its typical Hollywood predictability at times but that is easily forgiven in light of the great performances.
A wealthy sociallite is kidnapped, buried alive, and a ransom is demanded to reveal her location--but she has less than 24 hours, that is, if the air in her makeshift coffin lasts that long.
The story has some noticeable plot flaws for a film that is attempting to be a serious crime drama.
This is a level of directing that is not normally seen on TV.
1st watched 3/31/2002 - 8 out of 10(Dir-Richard Shepard): Well-made thriller that is advertised by it's depiction of being buried alive and is actually much more than this.
Which is interesting since it sometimes has that long feeling of an Altman shot here and there, or one that is held for longer than one might expect in a TV show; one crucial shot being when Jack Tanner (Michael Murphy) is shot unawares by a camera looking through a glass coffee table as he gives a passionate monologue to his campaign team after a bad day.
Ms. Arquette is hot...aside from that...she has created a film that is one of the finest films about music that I have seen.
Written at a time in his life when he doubted if he could (read: should) be the 'voice' of the forgotten women, the broken woman, the fallen woman, ...the woman that is often invisible in most church congregations, after the release of his novel, the overwhelming answer was 'preach on, T.D., preach on'.
I sure many feel its a movie for women and that is not necessarily so.
For me this is one of the few films I found that is beyond my scope of experience.
It's not a new story, but it captures the feeling of a first love in a way that is hard to not be moved.
Do we do good because that is our nature or because we are fulfilling a desire to be good?
What so unusual about that is, that I am for capital punishment.
An open and honest commentary that is sorely missed in this day and age.
This movie has wonderful symbolism that is expressed in so many ways.
her subtle device is her hand-held camcorder that is both the source of some footage and an insulator between herself and the interviewee--removing most of the congeniality that surely exists while allowing her subjects to speak frankly without pretense.
Another interesting feature of the movie is that it does not follow the easy path of romance that is "expected" by the public.
His interaction with Madame La turns from gratitude into a noble love that is not meant to be.
Patrice Leconte has directed with panache as he takes us to see the beauty of Saint Pierre, something that is so bleak, yet it's a place that has a magnetic attraction as we watch the film unfold.
The alien villain is actually a very sweet looking puppet that is frighteningly insectiod-like.
A man who began his life as an emperor but ended as a monk achieving what he dreamt of which is to become the greatest emperor in history, that is emperor of hearts.
On a third viewing on DVD I am confirmed in my opinion that this is not only the best historical film produced in India but that is as good as the best Hollywood films such as Gladiator and Braveheart.
But, unfortunately, that is the only laugh to be had.
That essence is as poignant and lingering as Indian spices, and that is why I love Asoka.
Some have complained that there is nothing in the film about his conversion to Buddhism, but that is really not the film's point.
Finally, many things of ''Asoka'' remembers me another great epic movie called ''Atilla'', that is directed by Dick Lowry: the way Asoka stays angry and starts to be a monster ,killing everybody after the supposed death of Kaurwaki, is very similar of Atilla 's behavior when his wife N'Kara dies.
A story of a traveller's travels, his education that is the journey, the loves and losses and wars and redemption all encompass this 173 minute epic that grips the viewer from the moment the camera pans down onto Asoka, as if indicating it is descending onto a mountain full of riches within, up until the deeply disturbing ending, which leaves the viewer with a ray of hope before the credits flash to announce not the end of the story but the beginning.
BOYS ARE EASY (1993) is a very funny movie about a Father (Richard Ng) that is worried that his three daughters are never going to get married.
I've personally never seen a film that is so raw, down at heel and realistic, almost like the cameraman followed these people around and simply filmed the horrors they go through... no cheese, no pretensions simply raw and unflinching in its portrayal.
Britain from time to time produces brilliantly realistic urban films, and here in Paul Andrew Wiliams' debut feature we have a truly great genre entry that is awash with realism.
However the direction is not upto the mark, and that is bad for the movie.
is a fantastic movie that shows real problems and that is harrowing to see.
just finished watching "The Man"with Samuel.L Jackson and Eugene Levy.not a bad offering.it's sort of in the vein of "48 hours".now i'm not equating the 2 movies with each other,though i do seem to recall being less than impressed with "48 hours.i did however find "the Man" entertaining from beginning to end,from both a dramatic viewpoint and a comedic one.the 2 stars are both very gifted actors,so it was good to see them in action.admittedly,the film was kind of light in tone(it could have had been a bit more substantial) and very short in its running time.however,for what it was,it worked very well.i do have one small complaint dough and that is that the movie did seem a bit mean spirited in the beginning.not sure why that would bother me,since i would usually not complain about something like that.
Added to this a score made only with drums, and some very abrupt editing that is almost painful to watch, makes this a worthwhile watch.
The movie makes the best out of a fairly unique story that is probably based on true historical facts.
It's a great drama/comedy that is funny and serious in the right spots.
Those changes make for a movie that is light years ahead of the predecessor and much more enjoyable to watch.
This movie was good fun and kept my attention - something that is quite difficult sometimes.
There's dragons... and there's even a few unique D&D monsters that is recognized from the books.
Man, that is about as UNBELIEVABLE as Mr. Miyagi (Pat Morita) speaking in broken-English, after having lived in the United States (since his teens) for over 50-years!
It takes some kind of negative panache to pull off a film that is so GODAWFUL.
Fifi accepts the invitation to have dinner with Steve, hurting the feelings of his secretary Anne Stuart (Gloria Jean) that is in love with him.
"But that isn't acting," Connery wisely replies, "That's necessary.
It is her bitter confrontation with Nobile after he has been safely brought back to King's Bay while the others were left freezing on the ice, that is the beginning of his sleepless nights.
Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer, and that is when he meets up with his former lover, Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan for getting them to Paris where the Tsarists have congregated after the revolution.
She does a good job with what little she is given to do, but that is not much.
The print that is on video has perfect sound and picture quality.
Dirty Harry film that is a n improvement on th enforcer.
We would like every day to be a Mardi Gras, even if that is the paradise of murderers who can disguise the way they want and be absolutely unseen, invisible.
At times I had a feeling I was watching a De Palma film - and that is the ultimate insult I can give to a thriller; coincidences, all-knowing criminal, etc.
This single father is struggling with his own demons, persuaded that until now he has screwed up about everything in his life, beginning with his marriage ... he's trying real hard to be a good father, as well as a good cop, that is until this killer comes along and threatens all he's been fighting for to preserve.
But, I'm not convinced it's an important contribution to any deeper understanding of the solitude and great silence that is the life force of Grande Chartreuse.
To have provided any would have interrupted the prevailing silence that is characteristic of the place.
But again, is this randomness appropriate in depicting a life that is anything but haphazard in its structure?
When you're going to see 'Into great Silence', do bear in mind that is is a nearly three hour documentary about a hermit order.
Not to mention that the device used to interlink the stories is a glowing green orb that is the source of all evil in the universe, again not that impressive.
The third story is better than the firts few called "Captain Stern" and it reminds me of the old Nelvana animated cartoon shows except for the language that is.
After it murders her father, it turns out to be the "Loc-Nar", a powerful and very dangerous meteorite that is the sum of all evil that can bring corruption, death and destruction to anyone who possesses it as it tells the girl and the viewer five tales of futuristic cab drivers, eroticism, aliens, outer space, zombies, warriors, babes, monsters, other worlds and good vs. evil.
There marriage is broken but that is about it (with respect to similarities).
This movie contains the famous bantering and mind games that Bud Abbott always pulled on Lou Costello...this adds to the entertainment value and it is great to watch a movie that is just plain entertaining!
Everything that is said is really silly.
Surf II has a strange intensity that is lacking in most films of today, too bad its not available on video or DVD.
Agatha Christie's novels have a structure that is a sort of cardinal rule.
Lois Chiles is the spoiled rich heiress that is murdered under strange circumstances (she looks for it all the time).
It is also very gripping with a crime that is forever tricky to work out and a truly unpredictable killer gives the film a perfect ending.
All in all; it is, in typical Christie fashion, a satire on the lives of the upper class that is buoyant with snippets of humour and romance as well as the inevitable murder (or rather four and a suicide).
One perfect example of that is when Jack and Jon go visit the home of where Jack's ex-wife and daughter live.
"Midnight Run" is a highly entertaining action/comedy movie with a heart, and if you have half the fun, watching it, as the actors obviously had while doing it, then you will have already enjoyed yourself a whole lot more than in any other movie that is "similar" to this one.
A great road/buddy movie that is made for adults - more like "One flew over the cukoo's nest" than "cannonball run", really.
This here is the kind of action comedy that is actually fun to watch, without getting lame or stupid or annoying.
Way too much objectionable language is the only fault of this otherwise extremely-entertaining film that is justifiably popular.
Then, when that is over, we see a wagon train moving west.
The acting was excellent, but that is not enough to make the film worth watching.
Its called Matador because that is the Danish name for the board game Monopoly.
But that is whys this is one of the greatest TV-series of times!!
"La Fille seule" is an absolute gem of a film that is particularly fascinating because its structural simplicity belies a complex, multi-layered character study.
It really is like you hear of how people re-evaluate after getting a diagnosis of a terminal illness - that is what this film has done for me.
But the charm that is present in this movie isn't present in most of the newer comedies.
The two share a wonderful chemistry that is one of the best that I have seen in movies.
Sometimes the directing and editing feels like it was done too hasty, with at times as a result an end result that isn't quite what it should had and could had been.
By the way, a couple things to look for: Yes, the dog "Mr. Smith" is the same dog that is "Asta" in the THIN MAN movies.
(I suppose, in the end, that is the point.
Irene Dunne is amazing in a layered performance that is both subtly affecting and side-splittingly funny - sometimes within the same scene!
Alice finds out about why that is happening, and also finds out about the puppies.
I suppose some of this can be credited to the werewolf/robot craze of the time, but I never imagined that the combination of the two would bear the twisted, disgusting fruit that is Project: Metalbeast.
This isn't the worst comedy of all-time, but that is about the best thing that I can say about this pathetic film.
Well suffice to say, that the reviewer is from Spain, so he should know if that is true or not.
For a thriller that is supposed to be action packed and only an hour and twenty minutes long, I was actually dumbfounded at how bored I was only half an hour in, and how painful the idea of another hour of this nonsense was to me.
For anyone that is easily made motion sick, the camera work is very shaky during the chase scene and had it lasted much longer would have detracted from the overall experience for me personally.
Of course it shows the same scene over and over- that is the entire premise of the movie!
Then Forest does something that is completely shocking.
When I was in my first year at university, I remember that one of my courses was entitled reading comprehension and for my exams, the topic of this course was based on a conversation between a man and a woman who talked about this widely talked about society phenomenon that is children adoption in Southern Asia.
Such is once again the case here with this film that is based on true facts.
The artform of the mime is one that, understandably perhaps, hasn't been treated much on the silver screen (in this way, it elicits comparison with the classic ballet-oriented THE RED SHOES [1948] Â which, similarly, adopted a stylized look throughout mixed with an adroit sense of the macabre); the most famous example is, of course, Jean-Louis Barrault's unforgettable Baptiste in Marcel Carne's LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS (1945) and Marcel Marceau (who has died fairly recently) can be said to be the only mime artist that is renowned worldwide.
Featuring incredibly artistic photography by Miyazaki Aoi (who dragged random people away from their busy lives in New York, to take their photos), stunning cinematography, beautiful music and one of the best acting performances ever captured on film, this is the perfect film for today's world that is suffering the cost of excessive greed.
This is one of those light movies that is so charming and enjoyable you can't even begrudge its slightly sappy ending.
Yet Patrick Wayne leads the cast in a Sinbad tale that is curiously unengaging.
First he must find a wise man named Melanthius (Patrick Troughton), but that is just the beginning of the journey that spans continents & is full of danger & evil...
One comedy that is so American that you may have problems sleeping afterwards because of the jaw pain you will get due to too much laughing.
Get to that film to discover the hundreds of details and risks out-of-towners run in New York City, an apple in which any smiling friendly face may be the worm that is eating the core of it.
Well, if you're a young male, that is...
This is a movie that is helped by its directing and writing, as many of the funny moments (which are clever and well thought-out) should be credited to the writers more so than the stars.
The story of an innocent young man drawn into the gangster world is not really a new one, and GREEN FISH does not try to add much that is new to it.
It makes horror of the worst kind, that is not real horror, just a crap with some horrifying scenes.
The ostensible reason of this initially is to rebuild the human race but with only 8 people that is going to be one limited gene pool.
it was a pity that IMDb didn't have the ability to rate movies as 0 because that is exactly what i would have given it.
As a matter of fact, several of the major players in the film were middle aged or even elderly, a notion that is both funny and refreshing for anyone who looks for something a little different in their heroes.
This is one of the best documentaries I've seen since Farenheit 9/11, Game exposes the truth about this lousy piece of garbage name G-Unit, game delivers one of his best performances as he exposes the lies, the deceptions and the evil surrounds this horrible group and pop rap group Pistol Pete from Terror Squad also delivers here as the person who exposed tony yayo as a coward, you know people always say you should listen to music like G-Unit, because it's good for hip hop's soul, it's not good, it is hateful, disgraceful, shameful and truly unbelievably tasteless, I Bet these stupid stans don't even know what real hip hop is, all they listen to is garbage like this, it's a shame that tupac and biggie & big pun turning on their graves and probably laughing at how pathetic the mainstream hip hop has become and especially for someone like fifty cent that is ruining it.
She has a perky attitude that is demanding of attention.
Over-exposure of breasts, depicting drug use in a way that is far from reality and poor acting - none of those mentioned appeals to me, sorry.
As the film progresses there are lots of naked sex scenes and that is about all this film has to offer, the acting is a disgrace and this really is the type of film production a porno studio would use as a story line and then of course the love making.
In fact, the word "obsessing" might be the keynote in her life, which she documents as it unfolds with a degree of relentlessness that is quite astonishing.
She also has a 'c**k book' that is composed of her famous friends' renderings of the male organ.
I said "touching" in the meaning that something in it - humour, breathtaking adventures, worth of respect friendship of man and horse, magic of arabian desert and idea of will, both human and animal, that is the reason for success - all these are mixed in unique brew, called "Hidalgo".
The cast and crew of Hidalgo have done a tremendous job of creating an entertaining and enjoyable film that is respectful of western, Sioux and Arabic cultures.
One that is accustomed to listening to Native American dialects might find that the softness, quietness and blending of the sounds is characteristic of this native language.
It is good to see that he is finally receiving top billings in movies, something that is perhaps overdue.
Themes of prejudice, equality, sexism, and human perseverance quietly lay a foundation for the rousing action and adventure that is being advertised.
After the gory excesses of suspense movies like Dressed To Kill, it is quite nice to get back to a style of thriller-making that is comparatively subtle.
I think that is what I enjoy.
Is there some symbolism here that is escaping me?
The monotony of the scene got to me, but I think that is because I am a product of my generation.
Many of the experiences would indicate that Andre had become a bit psychotic, what with hearing voices, picturing birds flying out of his mouth, seeing passengers on an airplane as having animal faces and, during a Catholic mass, envisioning a huge creature that is half bull, half man, with blue skin, and poppies growing out if its toenails.
Its possible the director introduced these jerks to give the camera-work greater variety, but when you already have a script that is as tough and deep as this, pioneering cinematography should not be a major concern.
But for those who want something a little different, something that is not at all conventional, this is the movie, possibly, of a lifetime.
The substance of this film is watered-down pseudo-philosophical tripe that is popular among the "free thinkers" of our time.
Equally, there were never any giant cabbages produced by  miraculous devic powers - that is myth started by one of the  founders, Peter Caddy (a nice guy, but possessing the marketing  ethics of Microsoft).
Its plot is quite basic the tale of a cop that works too hard and a wife that is neglected.
Truly a refreshing change from the normal sort of tosh that is churned out by the bucket-load in Hollywood.
One things that is drastically lacking in the more developed areas of our world today is a social conscience.
Some have called it too didactic, but I don't think that is a problem.
Helped enormously by an appealing cast who perfectly capture the ebullience, exuberance and idealism of twentysomethings, director/co-writer Hans Weingartner brings to life an intelligent film about politics that is also very funny and wonderfully romantic.
So it is frustrating to learn on the IMDb message boards that the director went back and added a clarifying scene that is only being shown in Germany.
all in all, the edukators is a breath of fresh air that is both satisfying to the head and the heart.
I think part of the issue is the same phenomena as Forrest Gump, that is the genius of the actor comes through, so you have a "brilliant idiot" As the father of a young daughter, I could relate.
It would be nice if things worked out as they have in this movie, which is why I liked this movie is because movies are aloud to be unrealistic and it's nice to leave the theater or turn of the DVD off after watching the film and feel good (that is if you're not so critical about movies).
Penn is highly under rated in the world that is movies, as he shows with this Oscar potential performance.
And this guy Jordan Clark is so naive that he doesn't recognize the violence that is there.
If this serves as something, that is as an example of what document is not supposed to be.
Add to that the enormous set of fantasy creatures you can use for battles (including centaurs, cyclops, unicorns, archers, Elves, at least seven types of dragons, basilisks, goblins, ghosts, skeletons, wizards, trolls, vampires and griffins, and I haven't even scratched the surface), a complex story, and complicated campaign scenarios, and you have the total winner that is Heroes III.
While, yes, there's some stereotypes about the Negroes being such simple people (with heaven presented as a fish fry and the angels getting ten-cent cigars), there's also a message about tolerance and how, despite all that's wrong with the world, there's also plenty that's right that is made clear at the end when there's word of someone being nailed at the cross...
The film is tense and exciting, and it's also a good indication of how times have changed; I mean, would you let your kid sleep in a room that is currently being inhabited by a male guest that you've only just met?
If that isn't bothersome enough, all the characters are friends in this show.
What makes Victor SjÃ¶strÃ¶m's film specifically Scandinavian is a sense of fatalism bordering on the mystical: we're told that no matter how fast a man can run, he can't escape his fate, and that is certainly the crux of the matter where the "outlaw" Berg-Ejvind is concerned.
**I don't know where to begin with this horrid harpy of a sequel that started a trend for the horror movie genre.How about the very idea of this film freddy is defeated in the first but in this time frame, new line was desperate for money and it shows.they thought why not make a sequel to the awesome movie we put out in 84.WE can make a completely illogical plot, stupid characters,the worst sequel in the franchise,bad acting from all the actors other then Robert Englund.This movie is probably best known for having the highest body count in the series.Usually that is a good thing in the original the deaths were unique and stylise.In this one they are just unoriginal in the first freddy would like write a cool message in you in this one you just get stabbed, or even worse that very brokeback scene with freddy in the shower whipping some dude.The plot sucks freddies trying to get reborn into the world by a whinny little kid, and only his neighbours love can save him?And it's got all kinds of bad special effects Wes Craven was probably ashamed of like that exploding bird,weird dog face things,the freddy coming through the kid seen,a better villain for this movie would have been that stupid school bus.It's got an unclimactic show off in the boiler room which set up part 3 which is a great movie.In conclusion if you buy the box set throw this out and part 5,6, and with 4 I don't care .Just stick with 1 3 and 7.
As far as horror sequels go this is one of the worst i have witnessed in a long time and is in great distance from the original and that is a shame!
Nancy is only mentioned in a diary that she left in the house that is found by Lisa and by Jesse's best friend Ron.
But yet the boyish side is emphasized by a hairless body, shiny and pure skin, a skin that is widely shown and slowly brushed up and down by the camera.
Both are victimized by the gay sports teacher on the football field a couple of times and in the end the boy, Jesse, will come to ask for help from his friend, Grady, and the first reaction will be nearly openly gay even if denied in some side remark, and Freddy will kill Grady through, from inside the body of Jesse : if that is not a repressed homosexual desire, what is ?
If one case is a coincidence, two are not and that is the main change of this film from a girl-centered vision of fear to a boy-centered vision.
He is an old pedophile and after having recaptured some existence through the dream of a girl in the first film, and having thus gotten a couple of boys in his bag through the desire of the girl for these boys, now he moves directly to the main target of his desire : he wants to possess a boy from inside, he is a gay pedophile and Jesse, to defend his sanity in this invasion, will have to react against this gayness that is imposed onto him and kill the boys and men Freddy desires.
But that is a real change in that kind of horror films : to take a point of view that focuses onto a boy, his desires, his fears, and his anxiety, all of it emphasized by a castrating authoritarian father and a loving, maybe too much, mother.
Nagesh Kukunoor's masterpiece inspired a lesser ripoff which still managed to keep me engaged.. but that is another topic.
But if you can spare two hours to be engrossed by a story that is at times grim, and times heartwarming and most of all surprising you *need* to see this film.
At least that is what you would think while you are watching the movie but then the acting is super.
And that is what exactly happened to me while watching the movie.
Nimitz is a nuclear aircraft carrier in 1980 that is stationed in Pearl Harbor.
There is USS Nimitz, nuclear carrier, equipped in jets, reconnaissance planes, marines, and so on, everything that is needed in modern warfare.
A cheesy after school thriller special that is meant to be laughed at.
This a real movie about thug life and the inescapable revolving door trap that is so hard to break.
This movie has a storyline that is strangely perverse for a made for TV movie.
I really don't think that the film has been completely planned in the strict (and too rigid sense), for this would also have taken away much of the emotional power from the film, as is the case with many too commercially calculated/that is, too strictly preplanned films from the USA.
But if that is the case for you, it's still able to keep it really intense and quite compelling.
It turned into a relationship comedy instead, and that is the end of many fine shows.
The only time he seems to be telling the truth is when he is with the driver and in the '55 and that is the one time someone tells him to shut up.
But that is in the end appropriate.
Maybe that is, in a sense, why it's a pure road movie.
There is also a small performance from Harry Dean Stanton that is endearing.
Then again, this may again be part of the "stripped down" theme that is so prevalent throughout.
He tells these creeps some very exaggerated tall tales of his life and that is one of the resounding features of the film, with the ultimate statement being the one he tells to two soldiers he picks up near the end, which turns the film around from its outlook at the beginning.
This is either the best film I've ever seen, or just an interesting exercise in film-making that is ultimately of little value.
They come from nowhere and are headed east, toward a destination that is murky at best.
A classic for the ages-----THE DARK AGES that is.
John Cage tells Ally that you can't find happiness in the real world, and that is why she is only happy in her imaginary world.
Since Gillian does contain a good cast with a notable performance from Danes, I gave it four out of ten stars but the talents of these people are ultimately lost in this poorly written melodrama that might elicit some tears and sighs from the audience, but is mostly a film about a rivalry between in-laws that is devoid of the compassion usually felt after the death of a loved one.
What I really hate about these movies is the fairy tale tone that is applied to the overall presentation.
The quirky scientist, with no apparent means of financial support and his realtor wife live in a house that is easily worth a million dollars, on a massive lot with impeccably maintained gardens.
What do you get when you have a movie that isn't funny enough to be called a comedy, and too boring to be called an action movie?
This is a high octane fun and friendly family movie that is built around the life of young Scotty (Alexander Pollock) and his scientist father (Jeff Goldblum) who whilst working too hard at trying to make a breakthrough for a cure to prevent dog allergies in humans.
To get it right, that is.
This,the fourth and last of the Matt Helm movies has a lot to recommend it and has serious credentials to be one of the most interesting films of the 60s and that is for a variety of reasons.One of these is the appearance of the late Sharon Tate who gives a very appealing comic performance in her final movie.The attractive 60s star Dahlia Lavi makes a good villainess and is a fine foil for Nigel Greene a respected English actor (who was later to die tragically) as the evil Count Contini.He had played a similar role in the earlier British spy thriller DEADLIER THAN THE MALE.Nancy Kwan also appears and so does Chuck Norris in a "blink and you'll miss him"screen debut.The reason Norris was in it at all was because of the movies' fight choreographer,none other than the legendary Bruce Lee himself and he does sterling work giving the many hand to hand combat scenes in THE WRECKING CREW a zest that was rare in action movies of the period that featured martial arts.
Our lovable schlemiel (dolt) can always laugh at himself when things go wrong and that is why we love him.
If you want to see a cool movie like this that is set in the Alaskan theme, check out 30 Days of Night.
It is set up in Northern Alaska with a crew that is supposed to be stalked by a unseen evil.
Dakota, Jose and Douglas along with a great troupe of other cast deliver a fun filled, exciting performance that is reminiscent of the comedy and exploits known of them on stage in live performance.
I would recommend this movie to anyone wishing to own a good comedy that is entertaining for the whole family.
It is an extraordinary piece that is told by its form, rather than text.
The film 'tells' nothing, but the story is dead clear and builds slowly to an emotional pitch that is almost unbearable.
When the Da and two kids walk on the tracks, the camera is set to a partially closed iris which intensifies the available light and colour in an otherworldly sheen--one that is gone when they return on the same tracks at night, in disappointment.
So even if you do or do not manage to see this movie,do NOT miss the music, since that is bound to stay with you longer.
OK, the idea behind it is good, but that is not enough.
Yes, that is true, but during this war also 6 million Poles died... And what is important: half of the killed Jews were Poles (which means that half of the killed Poles were Jews).
Ultimately, you end up with two frustrating people in a pointless relationship that is a circle of hope and failure over and over again.
Greenwald directed this film from the play by Michael Cristofer and I'm not sure what drew his attention to this but the end result is a dull film that is both poorly constructed and repetitious.
And Fiona uncovers a mystery that is fairly unbelieveable!
Not so in France, however, where the film is TOTALLY unknown, a strange state of affairs for a country which is only now trying to atone for its treatment of its Jewish population of 60 years ago, whereas in most other countries, all that is past history.
This is a film that should be seen by more audiences but probably won't and that is unfortunate for The Secret of Roan Inish is a gem in a sea of mediocre Hollywood fare.
It shows everything that is good and pure about Ireland.
I would like to think that these are friends who don't appreciate fine film, but I must, in all fairness, entertain the thought that perhaps this is a movie that isn't for all tastes.
While the love scene of Angelica and Jericho was much hyped, there is nothing to arouse the viewers (if that is what you are looking for).
The director, John Sayles, bring us a version of the legend of the selkie, a creature that is half seal-half human.
One hesitates to call it a children's movie or a family movie because those are generally awful, but it is very much the sort of movie that is perfect to take the family too (although it is unaccountably rated PG).
His trade is to find "missing heirs", that is those people who inherit money from relatives they never heard of, etc.
She delivers many important messages with her dancers and states that we all enter the world as better people than who we are and have compassion for all mankind and take into consideration the pain and suffering that is going on in the world.
It's interesting to learn all the process of the show and all the work that is done by people!
Hausu is a marvel that is bizarre for *Japan* nevermind America and the rest of the world, and should be seen by anyone interested in the kind of kick-ass-do-whatever-for-crazy-art it takes (i.e.
It's wall to wall, full of eerie horror themes, cartoonish comedy sections, pop songs, strings, and sounds which are just generally unclassifiable, possibly because two songs might be played at the same time, or against a scene that is completely inappropriate.
It occurred to me a day after I watched this movie that I had seen a film by Nobuhiko Obayashi before, the campy kaleidoscopic "Sada"(a true story about a woman who castrated her lover and became an overnight celebrity in WW2), and though that is a mere hint of the full on onslaught of this movie, it makes me want to see more.
Very delightfully strange that is, as "Hausu" is a bizarre gem that must not be missed by lovers of the surreal.
Suffice it to say you have never seen a film like this before -- part satire, part camp, part coming-of-age story, merged with horror that is truly disturbing.
So that is how I found myself in the movie "The Cannonball Run"...
First of all, there is NO 'Laughter on the 23rd Floor' or any other floor - and for a Neil Simon play that is shameful.
While the humour is admittedly silly, that is what the movie is about - it's a silly but extremely entertaining movie with hot 80s chicks and fast cars.
The animation is closer to the original concepts for the manga and adds amazingly gorgeous music to produce a show that is an instant draw.
If you want to see something like this that is more interesting, might I recommend "Party Girl" or "Monster".
Don't miss seeing a comedy-drama that is truly realistic.
The rude nature of the South West of France alongside the plot of the movie where three well known french actors give the best of themselves in a story that is taken of reality of those years of the 70's.
I do feel that this production is frequently over the top in milking the humor, but that is one of the intrinsic problems of filmed live performances, and the audience was clearly having a great time enjoying the antics of Jon English.
Eddie "Rochester" Anderson is thoroughly wasted in a role that is overtly racist.
I found this film more charming than the Cary Grant film (and that is saying something!)
Great chiller that is definitely worth viewing.
I am 100% sure that each and every scene and detail is well crafted out in the script Â word by word, image by image, page by page, and that is reflected on the screen.
All actors have given performance that is expected from them.
Perhaps that is the reason why it did not do so well at the box office.
But that is all there is.
The story revolves around a family,that is hiding secrets that once revealed,might have deadly consequences upon them.It is inspired by some of Shakespeare's works and it echoes throughout the film.It's about one aging guard(Bachchan),named Eklavya; who has served for the family all his life.Many generations of his family has served before him and he must continue to do so,carry on their legacy.The family of the Kindom of Devigarh itself has mysteries that keeps echoing throughout the film.Eklavya has sworn to protect the family no matter what.He also protects some of the secrets that can never be spread throughout the Kindom.Until,one night,the Queen of the Kindom dies,besides her is her mourning husband.This starts the doubts and accusations within the family.The Queen's Son,Prince Harshwardhan(Khan) arrives to take responsibility of the family.But there are other things going on in the palace.Slowly,one mystery after another pops up and secrets are revealed,and as the story progresses we see more and more people dying because of the secrets.Putting Eklavya into a painful position and come to terms with the happenings and the truths about this family's dark history.
If the whole movie was compiled with the same conviction that is in these scenes it would be good enough for an Oscar nomination!
Eklavya is a visual fest that is ruined by two things - a really shoddy plot and the Amitabh playing the goat.
The treatment goes from extremely spoofable (the screenplay is THAT mediocre) to intensely admirable between shots-and that is where the audience's attention wanes.
A truth that is shocking.
Enter a royal mansion of Rajasthan, India that is filled with secrets.
Your right thumb--that is what I want as my "dakshina", commands Dronacharya.
Well, that is what you get.
Superficial characteristics are easy targets, and that is exactly the point of this movie.
Although that isn't exactly difficult.
It's an eerie, haunting score that is used in the scenes very appropriately and makes things much more unsettling and spooky, as if things aren't creepy enough.
While it contains plenty of frightening shocks and gore, that is only the suurface level, and the focus for watching it the first time.
There is no ghost of Daniel Robetei, but rather an entity that is formed by rumor, faith, fear, and the story itself.
This really is a fantastic, original story that is much more complex than that of any other horror movie I have seen.
Tony Todd and Virginia Madsen have a fantastic chemistry that is very convincing.
He comes back to haunt her as we discover that this is a story that is being replayed and must have a closure.
Unfortunately, she finds that this is no urban legend but the tragic truth...  A horror movie that is authentically creepy and unsettling, making it leagues ahead of other movies of its ilk.
In spite of the technical limitations of the early 70s Sagal manages to create a feel of emptiness about LA that is masterfully executed.
Unfortunately that is all it has going for it.
Also of note is that none of the fight sequences evoke excitement and overall we are left to watch a movie that is hideously dull in it's uninspired tone.
Sure, it isn't Shakespeare or amazingly artistic--just good old fun that is very re-watchable.
Seen from today's perspective, Charlton Heston's depiction of the isolated, besieged man of science, Dr Neville, seems eerily evocative for the embattled minority of us who cling to the ideal of scientific truth that is now under attack.
As in The Omega Man, we now see the mass media that is a product of science used by that media's own opportunistic elements to generate a hostility to science that they can then play to their own advantage.
We have reached the point at which to dare raise the pseudo-scientific nature of the dominant political ideology that is environmentalism is to risk being rendered an outcast, like Neville.
Anyone who has read the book its based on, the incredible "I am Legend" by Richard Matheson, knows that this film has very little in common with it beyond its initial premise--and even that is not followed too closely.
If you like both cyborgs and kick-boxing this is definitely a movie you should watch, but if either turns you off, you should probably stay away, as that is pretty much all there is going on in this movie.
Here's the last man on earth watching huge mobs of people crowd up the world that is now empty.
I don't need them to be tough macho guys, but during key conversations, these two straight men discuss life, marriage, and cheating in a manner that is wimpy and boring.
For me, that is surely the essence of anime; one which is often spoiled by splicing-in out of place CGI (Ghost in the Shell: SAC take note) or relying solely on it (Final Fantasy, Appleseed etc).
Gabe and Karen are like me and my Husband, so that is really great to see.
When Gabe and Tom are having lunch and Gabe tells Tom that the four of them were to grow old together, watch each others kids grow up and cry at their weddings, now that is friendship.
Toni Collette's Beth is an enigma until her confrontation with Karen at the restaurant, then, we see a woman that is not shy in telling her best friend off as she embarks in a new relationship.
Using a mix of 2D and 3D cgi this is a film that is vibrantly alive.
There is a real sense of place that is missing from many animated films.
This was a very good return for the hero that is Sharpe, but I must say that it was a disappointment!
This focus' too much on a plot that is not very strong to start with!
Rant over, I will still be going out to buy the DVD, and will enjoy every second that is on offer, superb!!
Tekkonkinkreet successfully delivers on appeasing any and all who are looking for high quality hand drawn animation which surpasses the eternally vapid conveyor belt of repetitiveness that is Pixar, but it also delivers on being more than just a "fighting" film.
I have seen and read all that is Sharpe and can honestly say that this is one of the best Sharpe films.
Just one word to sum up this fantastic new dose of Sharpe and that is 'SU-BLOODY-PERB'.
1) We have the Prophet of the Objects walking out of the hospital--and that is it, nothing more from him.
This poses a problem with the "rules" they set up for objects returned to the room, unless that is where the key would have been originally.
It feels like something based on a book, because it has such a complete and detailed mythology and a feeling of back story that is rare in the work of screenwriters.
And that is the fact that it wasn't made like a mini series.
SciFi has actually produced something that is worthy of its name.
At first, it appears to be an adventure that is random for the sake of being random.
This film had very interesting art, childish of a sort, but designed for the sake of experimentation, and to remind us that we're in a story that is seen and narrated by children.
The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us!
It seems once a generation there is an outstanding child actor that is believable.
In addition, there is a lot of filler that is frankly inane & complements the plot line about as well as Ripple does Chateaubriand.
Everything that is enjoyable about B movies is here, and I will never get bored of films like this.
If that is not enough, it also starred Golden Globe winner Ursula Andress (Dr. No) and Alain Delon (Le SamouraÃ¯, The Leopard).
He is accompanying the Japanese Ambassador on a train that is robbed by Bronson and Delon.
Instead we get another comedy/horror hybrid that is not scary and is not funny.
What you get is a very bad movie that isn't funny or scary which is exactly what one would expect when combining characters from other movies that are also not funny or scary.
Very effective imagery, and a story that is told so well that you know where it is going at the end.
Crazy Love does not have a particularly good reputation these days, although it apparently caused quite a stir upon its release and that isn't all that surprising considering the subject matter; although to be honest, nothing in this film particularly shocked or offended me.
Overall, it's not really surprising that this film hasn't gone down as an all time 'classic, but it certainly has its place among cult fans and that isn't surprising either.
It also has to be said that the director has managed to convey a real sense of Bukowski's writings/life and that is no small feat in itself.
As as joke, they steal a corpse out of a motor hearse that is parked in front of a hospital and take it home with them.
Somehow that is a slap in your face and so touching at the same time.
"Izo" is a cold film, a distancing film, but it has an intensity that is engaging and a sense of anarchy about it that recalls Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers".
In a lot of ways, this film reminds me of "El Topo" -- a movie that is disguised as a genre effort (El Topo being a Western, this being a samurai swordfighting film) that uses the basic genre outlines but explores topics deeper than have ever been covered in the genre before...
If you love film, especially film that is so off the beaten track as to be in a universe three doors down see this film.
As music with dance creates an experience that is more than both, this creation is much more than a film.
We are taken to meet Caco, a man that is being threatened by an opposing clan because his brother Mario killed one of the Caracava men, something that will not be forgotten until justice is done.
As far as the girl seducing Elder Groberg and her mother wanting him to father half-white babies goes, something like that is not hard to fathom.
Thank you for pouring your life into this so we may view the greatness that is the life of John H. Groberg.
It's based on a true story that is about a missionary who has to go to Tonga for 3years to preach the gospel.Tonga is a small Island and first he experiences a huge shock of culture.
See a South Pacific adventure that is, for once, totally based on real life and real historic occurrences.
An atrociously made, acted and dubbed cannibal movie that is also very tame in terms of violence (except for a scene where a crocodile is skinned alive) and nudity (it must have been on the female lead's contract not to have a single nude scene).
Splash is a fabulous movie that is truly touching to the heart.
With music by Lee Holrdige that is very moving and splendid cinematography by Donald Peterman.
I was also amazed at how popular "Gator" was all through the '80s and I had absolutely no clue who he was - that is until I seen this film.
He walks off her front porch only to first turn around and kiss a plate with her name written on it that is displayed by her front door.
There is a perversion of civil society, law and order, and moral justice that is acceptable to the "Parisians" but wouldn't be acceptable in a "free" society.
A delightful visual feast and cinematic event that is thoroughly recommended.
A subtitled film that is a joy to watch.
Setting aside the question of whether it is physically possible to separate conjoined twins in adulthood (I'm not a doctor) I did nevertheless find myself wondering about the psychological impact, and the movie doesn't really address that issue in any detail.
The loss that is felt at the end can be shared by millions of people who have lots someone that close to them.
The premise which is cojoined twins played by the Polish brothers, identical twins, is original and delivered with a poignancy that is rare.
Nothing transpires that is even remotely cool.
that is the overall theme of the unsung hero in this movie.
If you decide to take these zany proceedings seriously, that is your choice, but approached in the right state of mind, it's often hilarious.
But to focus on that is missing the point entirely.
At first "Bicentennial Man" looks to be about a futuristic family who buys an android robot that is supposed to do housework and serve them.
A lust for information that is never appropriately granted.
No matter what your preference that is a fact.
With Nikita, Luc Besson has given the audience the most suitable ending, one that is completely satisfying.
Man, this is everything I want while watching a Spaghetti Western, great characters, a solid story, superb action sequences, and best of all a fantastic score that is the just the icing on the cake.
All and all, I was satisfied at the end and had a cheesy smile on my face throughout the running time which cannot be achieved easily as my facade is rarely penetrated by anything that isn't of the highest quality.
Nero and Milian are employed by corrupt Mexican General Mongo to travel to the US and free the Mexican professor Xantos that is held captive in Fort Yuma.
Xantos knows the code to a safe that is impossible to open and with the gold General Mongo hopes to finance the revolution against Porfirio Diaz.
That's enough for Bill to learn the lesson, that is to overcome his prejudices (which coincide with her own prejudices; so, after all, even Miss Dove has something to learn).
that I actually found myself laughing out loud many times, particularly when both leads were locked up under "arrest" in adjoining cells and touched hands through their respective windows -- now that is cinema!!
I even think the character played by Marcel Schlutt (who is a total hottie) has some acting potential, but that is unfortunately not exploited by the film's director.
David Ogden Stiers portrays Hilley's final conquest; she manipulates him from Florida to New Hampshire- he will buy her anything she wants- that is all she needs to know.
I'm quite surprised this movie hasn't made it to IMDb's top 250 list, because this should be a movie that is recognized as the best performance from Meryl Streep in film history.
One criticism that is sometimes made of Streep is that she is too intellectual an actress, self-consciously thinking her way into a part rather than trying to live it emotionally, but in this case at least this seems to be the right approach.
In film, that is where real magic starts and there is no master of medium that hasn't mastered this essence.
The second part is when Buffalo Bill goes east, and that is when the film is at its best.
From the very little information we get about the murdered wife, she seems, if not faithful (that is, if the adultery DID happen), at least a caring and competent housewife and there hasn't been any serious confliction between her and the main character.
Story that is sometimes weird, sometimes just bad.
"In The Company Of Men" is a simple story that is told in a simple way.
Contrary to popular belief, stage acting is more natural than film acting; Labute's distance and long takes create a realism that is rarely seen on celluloid.
Howard is also a very real character, that type of stupid guy with lack of personality and self-esteem that is easily used by others, becoming a loser in the end.
Much like others, In the Company of Men initially enraged me due to the harsh treatment and depiction of women in the workplace, but then it occurred to me, that isn't what LaBute wants to show.
This is a very serious film that is sometimes very difficult to watch.
I would highly recommend watching the documentary and musician interviews as a preview of the energy that is to come.
Part of the reason people seem to think it is terrible may be because, whether intentionally or not, the film sets about mocking Reality Television (which is a major part of the film), so while you may watch the film and think that it is rubbish, perhaps that is what the creators want you to think.
Cruel World is a slasher film you don't take seriously at all, because it is a movie that is pure, slasher fun with a lot of humor involved.
If that is true, it could have driven him insane.
Still this is an excellent documentary about a subject that is never covered.
You are probably asking yourself how will you know when that is?
The astronauts endure the strain and trauma of take off in what are very obviously easy chair recliners.The battle of the sexes that is the real reason for for movie plays out like the most ham handed soap opera you ever saw on daytime TV.
The UFO sequence is very lame and the comic behavior of a man just out of prison seems inappropriate as he marches like a soldier then runs after a jogging team that is passing by.
She is absolutely flawless, and she is certainly a breath of fresh air in a film that is often quite stagnant and misguided.
There is a certain joy of life depicted in this film that is in some ways also bittersweet (and yet refreshing).
None of that is present here in this paranoid monstrosity that brought the overrated Helen Hayes back to the screen as the mom of a (gasp) suspected Commie.
Some Jewish writers bemoan that the Holocaust has had no Solzhenitsyn to tell the story as he did of the Soviet camps across the three volumes and 2,000 pages that is the horror and gore of The Gulag Archipelago.
No way,...that is, unless classic means "heaping pile of crap".
They will be able to feel the emotions of the mother and will be indignant at the attitude of the grandmother - and that is quite understandeable.
And that is love.
And she assumes an air of breezy self-assurance that is so strong and so undiluted with any sense of self-deprecation or humor that it makes her annoying.
It's simply a very good film that is definitely worth a buy.
A subject that is not easily tackled but the director, Brian Pimental deals with it beautifully.
As I have said before, a very underrated movie, that is well worth watching.
It is more something that is based on a false lore that has been told for years.
Bela Lugosi, so often underrated as a performer (even though he played none other than Jesus Christ on stage to some acclaim), manages, here, to convey a sense of loss that is almost palpable.
This was the most expensive personal car in the Cadillac Line of cars $15,000 msrp give or take, and that is in 1979 dollars.
Then, there is a movie that is upsetting or intricate or unusual, and you leave unsure, but you think about it the next day, or off and on for a week, or off and on forever.
I don't find it to be a discouraging element to making the decision to see a movie, because that is a reaction that is highly unusual.
The difference is that there was campiness in Nicholson's performance that isn't at all in this film.
Indeed the stories don't go to deep most of the time and that is the appealing part of it, but now and then people have a need for extra emotions besides humor.
That's why when I see something different I am excited--and this film, fortunately, has a lot to offer that is different and worth seeing.
Ladd will pretend to be the boy and the only thing missing is a birthmark--and that is soon added by giving Ladd a tattoo that looks identical.
Environment", it is Environment that is found to be the culprit!
In that encounter, Cagney's character exhibits a total disregard for others that is downright chilling.
Awful Dialogue, Acting, Inept structure and Poor effects... as well as an ending that is so pointless and tacked on that it made the previous 90 minutes seem ever more pointless.
A young naked schoolgirl is found hanged in a room locked from the inside, the police suspect suicide, until that is the clues seem to point in the direction of murder.
again returns to his schoolgirl in peril themed story and like its predecessor it's a highly controversial topic that is handled professionally and intelligently.
Only this time around the focus is more on the police procedure than the blood and sleaze that is associated with the giallo.
Add to that a sterling score by Cipriani that is equal parts suspenseful and subtle and some well handled action scenes and car chases in the poliziottescho mold (although it lacks the rampant energy of one, so I wouldn't classify it as such) and here you have a movie that is definitely worth the time of ANY fan of 70's Italian crime cinema.
Joan's close-ups look like some kind of art deco over-colorized presentation that is guaranteed to make the viewer wonder if this was intended as a joke or as a surreal escape.
I've totally trashed this movie, and that isn't entirely fair.
Most people like an ending that is at least hopeful if not actually happy.
Clearly this is one of the classic examples of a 60's and 70's Movie adaptation of a book that is an unsung masterpiece of how you can as a producer, Director of Photography, Set Designer or Special Effects coordinator relay the textual concept, intention and feel of the original author in to a visual and intellectual Science Fiction thriller.
Colossus is the new defense supercomputer that is trying to take over the world, and Dr. Forbin is the man who created it, and now must stop it.
Even while attempting to become the dictator of Earth, Colossus sometimes displays a sense of humor that is almost human, and a ruthlessness that is all too human.
In this film, it is the human spirit that is the casualty while the human biology lingers on.
It is pure logic, and that is what is also scary -- making decisions without regard to the value of a single, human life.
Even though we may not create a defense system in this way, it seems to predict a visage of something that is yet to come.
The result is a chilling scenario that is potentially becoming all too real these days.
There is a brilliant climax involving a skinning that is implied to great effect and a big explosion to end it all.
Looking back at my youth, there is one place that could come close to a zoo, and that is high school, as the kids are out of control, and all the students are tearing each other to bits.
This person cannot even write a simple sentence, yet they feel they can bash a show that is obviously superior to their own banal excuse for intellect - and I don't even know what that means.
Excellent remake that is actually better then the original.
Like I said, I don't mind, but lately that is all we get shoved down our throats in horror movies these days.
Overall, this is a worthy-remake that is gorier, freakier, and scarier in some-spots than the original.
Night of the Living Dead '90 is a top film, it's how remakes should be done & is a fantastic homage to original that is a great film in it's own right.
Thirdly, the element of the story that is perhaps the most pertinent to our 'modern' world.
There is even a romance that is not simply thrown in but is fairly well integrated into the plot and important to the outcome.
I get very easily turned off by things that are overly happy or in "la la land," but this movie has an overwhelming positive energy that is just irresistible -- not to mention every frame is gorgeous and the plot is good.
The story is totally absurd and very simple (The black cat storyline has absolutely nothing to do with the movie and serves no purpose at all) but yet that is what maybe makes this movie extremely fun and easy to watch.
Not only does it appear to have been photographed by Toulouse-Lautrec and Mucha, it portrays the geographic Paris; the streets accessible only by staircases, the unpleasant end of fleeting popularity, and the sexual opportunism of men with a product to sell, in an uncompromising picture of show business that is in stark contrast with the picture painted by Hollywood.
Perhaps it's a big step for modern Russian movie industry, but am I wrong for desiring a movie that is _done_ better?
Overall a disaster barring some Suneil Shetty portions and his few lines the film is unbearable Suneil does manage to make you laugh with his Bhaigiri but that isn't much
The songs save for one are all forgettable and i doubt the one that is OK will leave its mark too.
If you have a 100min or so to kill, and want to watch a low budget Italian/Spanish anti-war(Vietnam)movie that is poorly written not very well acted, somewhat funny(although it was not filmed for any laughs), and has a better version of Tara Reid then Tara Reid herself in it...then this movie is for you...Andrew Wolf(II)
There's a lot of pop psychology hokum floating around in the story, which needn't be gone into except to say that hypnosis is a curious altered state of consciousness that isn't well understood at all.
And there isn't a moment in "Whirlpool" that is the equal of the scene in which Tierney reappears from the dead to find a half-drunk Dana Andrews sitting in her living room just after he's gone through her lingerie drawer.
As happens often in Besson's work, in fact, the female character is put into a realm of personal chaos that is created by or leads to murder and, at the least, harrowing times with the one she cares for or about (i.e.
I think kids will like it, and in the end that is who the movie was made for.
It is the way they show the "Carnosaurs" and the "Velociraptors" that is scary, in combination with the music.
My daughter that is used to see movies and usually watch them could stop moving the whole representation.
The opening scenes were the most colorful, where we are taken to flight in the wings of a flying Pteranodon, switching from various scenery that is a breathtaking sight.
Finally Disney has created an animation that isn't sugar-sweet!
It's a serious movie that is very sad and partially cruel: a wonderful tale of courage and survival, told with respect for the audience, with unpresidented animations.
And surging through it all there is a feeling of sadness and loss, for a world that is about to fade away into the pages of history.
If so, that is what this film does for me.
Bogie is fabulous as always (although he does hold his arms a bit like a primate when he walks), Leslie Howard is playing the watery romantic that Leslie Howard does best, Bette Davis's face actually doesn't frighten me for once (no offense Bette Davis fans, she's a great actress, but I first saw her in "The Nanny" and that is how I will always remember her).
Bette Davis gives a fine performance as an idealist young waitress that is enchanted by a vagabond that happens upon the diner, Alan Squier.
The prior reviewer is right about one thing and that is that the lead actress just doesn't carry this off.
Its not brilliant art but is more factual than much of the stuff that is written about and discussed in Earhart circles.
Stahl looks such a twit in his ensign's uniform with a hat that is seven sizes too big.
Zinaida, being loved by young Vladimir, is separated from her young lover because his mother sees the danger in a relationship that is clearly below the young man's situation in life.
Julie Walters is usually fantastic especially in the type of character that is required of her here, James Fox starred in one of my favourite films, and I honestly used to think that I would enjoy Nick Stahl in any role - he usually brings such pathos to his characters.
Shot in the usual hap  hazard Cassavetes style, this one packs a punch that is hard to  take.
John Cassavetes' The Killing Of A Chinese Bookie is a film that is one of those overlooked gems that is not only a great film, but a great record of its time, even if it might have more properly been titled The Murder Of A Chinese Bookie.
I love American genre films of the 70's so that is mainly why I started with this one, and it scored.
Ben Gazzara provides an unforgettable portrait of a man grappling with a life that is beyond his ability to control.
The majority of mainstream cinema is structured to deliver an escapist experience to the movie-going public because that is likely the primary reason why most people go to the movies; to see, hear and experience escapist fantasy.
But as mundane as these sequences seem, the fact remains that the story would be all the less compelling, were we to see our anti-hero in flashy sequences that synthetically push the story forward, beyond a natural pace that is apropos to the situation.
I guess that that is great, but it is very odd and hard to understand.
This is not a glossy, "high-concept" film that Hollywood prefers (although Scorsese is certainly not "high-concept"); it is a rough, confusing muddle and that is probably one of the reasons the film remains highly unseen by a great many people.
Tell Me Something is also one of the only movies I've seen in the past few years that has a surprise ending that is genuinely surprising.
These suspects are all acting totally wrong given the situation, and that is why we suspect them.
Because Detective Oh (Yes that is his name), dies while the main villain is in the custody of the lead detective.
(Side note, not to sound stereotypical, I admire the Asian community a great deal, but that is the only problem I have with watching Asian film.
Similar scenes follow and the film also includes one of the nastiest highway multi car accidents I've ever seen, and that is definitely an unusually horrific scene!
Many have suggested there may be something, lost in translation and that is a fair point but my own feeling is that the film makers simply overstretched themselves a little.
But, can Harold pull off the impossible, that is, fix the screenplay and get Amanda to fall for him, too?
But in the end to be less than a documentary about the rigors and rewards of dancing there must be a well-acted story based on a sensitive script and that is where the film is shaky and a bit self indulgent.
Serra creates an atmosphere that is much a part of the setting as the lighting or set decoration.
Because that is the only explanation as to why this show ever existed... As filler to appease the law so the Comedy channel would have "Canadian" shows on.
Popcultured is one of those shows that comes along once in a great while that is so incomprehensibly bad, you find yourself waiting for the camera to pan out revealing an appalled Jason Bateman watching it on his set as some sort of clever comment on the state of the TV nation.
The emotional undercurrent at first seems subtle and subdued, but has a constant underlying intensity that is unavoidable and finally sweeps you away with it.
This film is an interesting period curiosity that is worth watching, but the 2002 film with Michael Caine and Brendan Frasier is much better and much truer to Greene's novel.
It perhaps could be criticised for the extraordinarily high amount of dialogue (it's one of those films where if you stop listening for 30 seconds, you'll lose the plot) but that is probably the only true weakness.
Whereas with human killers, that is not the case.
I can report, in all honesty that is is a rare instance where a sequel is better than the original.
I also recommend seeing the original first; it is not as good as this one, however it is still a very good, and important film, as that is the one that started it all.
awesome, that is the word i would use to sum up All hell breaks loose part 1!
This is one episode that is definitely better on a re-watch.
Here comes the silent message and the sad end (as the name suggests) where Zooni has to choose between right or wrong, between the life with her son and lover/husband who has returned after years or the country's wellbeing that is in danger if Rehan succeeds in his plan.
But that is where it ends.
All in all, Fanaa is a very well made movie, that isn't exactly up to the standard that Kunal Kohli set with Hum Tum, but close.
It may help people to look at the Kashmir issue from a different angle but it does certainly portray one fact, and that is a seemingly ruthless terrorist can actually be a simple and kind man fighting for his land's freedom.
This is where I realized that the times, they are a-changing: sweet, blind (in more ways than one), sheltered Zooni is so consumed by love that she permits Rehan to bed her before he weds her, a phenomenon that is exceedingly rare (or used to be) in Hindi films.
I personally felt the second half of the film needed no songs, but that is my own quibble.
I missed the beginning, which would have detailed some type of alien cylinder that is placed in the ocean, one that drives sharks into a feeding frenzy.
But this missing piece only increased my appreciation for the horror that is RAGING SHARKS.
Typical of Jones's serviceable but rather dull Disney pastiches that characterised his early work, 'The Night Watchman' is an unbearably gooey little offering with a constant lack of energy that is sorely required to bolster the wafer thin plot.
The characters are all severely lacking in charisma, particularly the so-wet-you-almost-don't-feel-sorry-for-him cat, the animation is lumbering and predictable, the musical number is flat and the story doesn't build naturally, instead resorting to a tacked on and completely unsatisfying finale in which the cat does a too-sudden about face and metes out a workmanlike beating to each individual rat, a production line revenge that is less than thrilling to watch.
Even though basically they end the same, there is an underlined sense of repentance in this movie's end that is completely absent from movie themes today.
Or, licking our chops at seeing the back stabbing behind the back two timing that is the very life breath of shows like "Survivor".
Not even the situation comedy seems likely to survive the venomous infection that is realty TV.
Very few actresses in Indian cinema have this much of screen presence that not even once you miss a lead actor in the movie, that is the old story behind a time-tested formula.
There is absolutely nothing in the movie that is worthy of mention apart from a couple of good scenes by Raghuvir Yadav and Irfaan Khan, which is why this gets 3 and not 1 out of 10.
But one thing is for sure and that is that this is the return of Madhuri Dixit, whose last film was "Devdas."
Lately, that boyfriend of hers, Mr. David has been a real pain in the ass, and today, he just might get it, that is, if he doesn't get her first.
Besides the fact that Divine is killed in the end, it seems to be a prequel to a young Divine's life that is later portrayed in "PINK FLAMINGOS".
The sound, cinematography, and editing is real rough, but it gives "Multiple Maniacs" a priceless documentary-like quality that is enhanced by the near flawless delivery of Waters' hilarious dialogue!
Sometimes you want to watch something that is fun and lighthearted with a happy ending.
Please forgive me but I fell in love with this movie even if it's not exactly the kind of movie that is hip.... Three young boys have no clue how a naked woman looks like so they save money to go to town and ask a hooker (Melanie Griffith) to show them her delicious body.
But the end product is not too bad and that is due to the tremendous talent of the crew and cast.
Then they show Saif Ali Khan in that I'm-20-years-older-so-I-need-gray-hairs wig that is just too much!
Honestly, this movie is just a waste of time, it's a very mediocre thriller that is, well for me at least, is just very predictable.
If, however, you occasionally indulge in something that is neither intellectually challenging nor deemed high art, but that is clean, bright and bubbly fun, you will enjoy this picture.
Please note that is in no way whatsoever any disrespect to the utilised foreign crews, quite the contrary - they are entirely as competent as any other, rather my problem is that the recent trend to shoot genre flicks in said countries has invariably produced some of the most truly mundane and inane action and horror fodder there is going!
This series is definitely NOT for those of a nervous disposition or who do not wish to enter the belly of the beast that is modern society.
But there are some very funny parts too, thanks to the stellar performances and the deliberately over-the-top writing that is most likely to shock people with the amount of depth it goes into.
After you've watched the first season, you'll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates Television, and no T.V show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos.
Michael Imperioli is Christopher, Tony's protÃ©gÃ©, whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed.
The "gangster" genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody.
The Sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it's content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance, humor and unvarnished violence.
I'm sure that is why there might be a general dislike of this character.
Meny of my people lose their homes and Jobs and some of them their love ones and that is worse what can hap-en to person.
But that is not the point.
Ah, that is not so difficult a question to answer.
Dark city is one of the most original pieces of sci-fi to come along in a long time, add that to the amazing visual look brought to the film by it's director and you have a body of work that is little short of perfect.
This is a movie that is excellent brain food.
In a sense, Murdoch's quest becomes a search for identity in a world that is trying to label him.
The underground world of the strangers themselves is claustrophobic, atmospheric, and actually is the most alien in architecture, suggesting a twisted, surrealistic world, yet one that is dependent on the world above them.
I'd rather sit through a slow movie that is good than a slow movie that is okay.
Harrison Ford, as per his norm, does a magnificent and highly believable job in his portrayal of the President - Some day we might have a president that is so action-oriented - but I doubt if we would in my lifetime.
It pulls together a lot of information that is jumbled in the public mind and makes it clear.
For fans of all ages The Land Unknown is a great film that is sure to delight all but the most critical of viewers.
Comment #55  The SharkTank Redemption is a satire of The Shawshank Redemption that is included on the 2-disc Collector's Edition DVD of the latter-mentioned film.
The only exception being I have a partner that is man.
Well acted, actually funny where it's supposed to be funny, sexy and suspenseful with an ending that isn't telegraphed from the beginning (though admittedly not nearly on par with the shock endings of such films as "Jason Goes To Hell - The Final Friday" or the shocks all throughout "Jian Gui" (aka "The Eye").
An absolutely awful "slasher" that is lacking everything a slasher movie should have; gore, sex, nudity, suspense, scares (give or take that last one).
An awful...bloody awful film that is hilarious in it's awfulness.
Yes, that is true, they should have killed themselves, that would have been MUCH better.
FYI....according to the movie producers Rwandans are genteel, soft-spoken people....that is what is most surprising about this genocide.
Carl Reiner's 1982 pastiche on 1940's film noir has never received its due as a genuinely clever, often hilarious salute to a genre that is ripe for satirical treatment.
Adapted from a John Steinbeck story, Lifeboat finds Hitchcock experimenting with a single set picture that is awash with propaganda and containing a cast that are across the bows, both endearing and totally interesting.
Here we have a story that is stationary, no movement in terms of setting or action and yet with a fine cast and wonderful writing, Hitchcock was able to create a timeless and suspenseful drama dictating what great lengths people are willing to go to in order to survive as well as the goodness of mankind that can shine through.
The level of suspense and drama is high, and there is one very "Hitckcock" scene that is frightening and scary.
They're crammed onto a small lifeboat, but there's one survivor that isn't quite welcome.
Well, that is the one thing you don't see with this movie.
In this film it looks like someone bigger than both our gang boss Bob Hoskins (our Godfather here) and his local rivals has arrived in town!-London town that is...
" That's dignified that is , going out like a raspberry ripple "   and the classic line   " I've heard of sleeping partners but you two are in a f--ki' coma "   Are there any shortcomings ?
Bob Hoskins raves and fights against a world that is rapidly moving beyond his control and, although he is an unpleasant, violent and vicious character, you end up caring for him.
As the battles and discoveries occur whilst the film wears on, numerous desperate situations are dragged out in a gritty and entertaining way such as Harold's relationship with his girl that is starting to fall apart amongst the terror and confusion, the personal battle with the American businessmen who foil Harold on several occasions and the question marks that arise over loyalties within his own organisation, as well as disagreements with his crooked policeman colleague and rival gangs.
A lot has been said about the great scene in the movie where Chuck continually criticizes Keith's guitar playing on "Carol", but that is nothing compared to what he put the producers through, between constantly asking for more money, being late or not showing up, plus an incredible experience at one of the prisons where Chuck spent time in his youth.
That said, this is a great movie that is hilarious to experience.
'Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds' is a sequel that is not really a sequel - unless the common thread of social attitudes and gender dilemmas as an ongoing tale is the source.
surprise;I found myself seeing an incredible good film.It has wonderful performances by(of course)Al Pacino ,Russel Crow,Christopher Plummer and Diane Venora.It's one of that strange cases when the theme of the film isn't very interesting , but the film is so well made that you enjoy it like if it would have the most interesting theme possible.Michael Mann shows that is one of the best directors;making an absolutely absorbing film ,starting with a non much interesting theme ;it has nearly hypnotic moments (the most of them when Al Pacino and Russel Crow are having a phone conversation).It's so absorbing that the 2 hours and a half of it seems like lees than 1 hour.I can't say what's the best thing the film has,why?
This movie is one long intriguing moment, a moment that is never boring or lacking.
Michael Mann is one of few directors who has such an in-depth understanding of both the subject of his film and the nature of that subject, that he is able to portray a realism that is nearly impossible to match.
This works in that it is the character that is elevated while the actor disappears.
But that isn't where the story ends.
It won't be a spoiler to state that the violent scenes are difficult to watch and some might find those out of place in a film that is decidedly anti-violence.
Once in a while, a television series will come along that is smart, funny, and honest.
I am also a freak and a geek watching a show that is basically a love letter to freaks and geeks.
Paul Feig still is active in comedy and has been overshadowed somewhat unfairly because of the juggernaut that is Judd Apatow's career.
Watching the out-takes, though, you notice that, in fact, that is not even remotely the case.
But the net result is the same inconsistent mess of a movie that isn't worth your hard earned money.
It also helps that Miklos Rozsa was the man composing the music, as everything shows a cohesiveness that is hard to distinguished in what was shot in 1982 and the old movies.
But I'm not even sure that is what annoys me most.
It was unfortunate that the series was not picked up at the time, but it has left the door open for the remake that is currently in production in Canada/Germany.
device turns out to be an important part of the plot and also seems to be a way of using the strangling scene that is taken from the Bette Davis movie - it is also a chance for Steve to get in a very tiny element of his 'wild and crazy guy' persona, which he substituted with a more suitable [for parody] 'straight' performance).
I rented this movie not expecting much, and that is a good thing because this film is a real stinker.
And his ghost floats around this bizarre, abandoned mansion, that is suddenly claimed by a handful of neighborhood teens who want to turn the pit into a party palace.
Well, if you like to waste money and you enjoy pain, that is.
Bones is notable for one of the most incredible reasons a film can be notable for, and that is that it stars a rapper.
It's a plot twist that is not often used.
An attempt to make a modern-dress Gothic melodrama that is just not successful.
It was nice to see Snoop in something different and anyone that is a Snoop Fan will enjoy this film all the more.....7 out of 10.
If not, however, you'll be intrigued by bleeding pool tables, talking severed heads, and a climax in the "city of the dead", that is actually well done and far surpasses the rest of the film.
The fourth and story is called "This Car Up", referring to an elevator in an office building and the budding relationship that is about to be explored by a bored office worker and a bicycle courier.
It may be like the Sopranos in that it is about a modern crime family, but except for that is quite different.
Yes it is a little edgy for network tv, but with the time slot that it was on made it ok. For the network tv they cut a lot out of the show that is shown on the DVD set.
This movie also ain't no documentary and its something that is somewhat between a full length movie and a fake-documentary, like "Nanook of the North".
When you have a volcano popping up not far from you, and throwing up huge magma bricks at you, that is not nice, i wasn't surprised the humans, well at least the Japanese lost the will to fight for life.
If you like something a bit different than big blockbusters, then this movie is so for you, because in Asia they approach everything from an objective point of view, that is what makes their quality.
After sitting through predictable bore fests I finally get a disaster movie that is worth two hours of My life.
It does have the merit of not showing directly the pornography and sexual perversions which are integral to the story, and that is a merciful release.
Instead, it very skillfully provokes thought as it unfolds the story and experiences of both sides of a heated issue that is at the very core of this film.
A very good Shaw Brothers production that is highly recommended for fans of the genre.
The Alphabet is very ambiguous and let's you come up with your explanation of what's going on and I think that is great.
The result is a beautiful, harrowing, poignant and lovely film that is criminally underrated, for it is by far one of the better Disney live action films.
There haven't been children's films that really embrace the darker side of things like these 2 films do since '85... and these under-viewed films deserve a little more credit and public acknowledgment for looking outside of the lines in a genre that is too often trapped within the lines.
If ever there was a film that is a picture of contrasts it's this one.
With Depalma, De Niro, and what looked to be a huge budget with a story that is already compelling enough in real life, there's no reason to make a film this absent of quality.
There are, in effect, three or four things that truly stand out about The UntouchablesÂan otherwise standard crime by-the-numbers rompÂand at least one of them should be attributed to the surface of the spectacle; the costumework and settings are superbly breathed life into, as is De Palma's accolade, with a screen that is awash with lyrical colours and accompanied by a swelly, jazzy moonlit music score.
The title is the same and that is all.
Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph.
I love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is a theme that is central to the films heartbeat, notice how some of the more violent scenes are followed by tender scenes of Ness and his family.
The movie is, as has been pointed out, much more faithful to the original television series with Robert Stack than the historical record, of which it bears virtually no resemblance, not that that is necessarily a problem.
De Niro captures the ruthlessness that indelibly marked Capone's infamy forever in the annals of criminal history, with a portrayal of him that is arguably the best in cinematic history.
I guess that isn't needed when a menacing Ving Raymes can say choice bits like "A storm is coming" or whatever the heck he said.
There is a quality to the shows that they work on that is simply missing in other productions.
This show is the very sort of program that is needed--desperately.
Have a good time watching the pilot as sadly that is likely to be all we will see of Aquaman.
Almost Human clearly shows that Milian is much more at home playing sadistic criminals; so seeing him as a copper, even one that is happy to break the rules, just isn't putting him in a position to do what he does best.
There's not a great deal of violence in the film, though that isn't a big problem as the plot itself usually contains enough to keep the audience entertained.
Here I was under the impression that I finally tracked down a copy of "Case of the Scorpion's Tail" and then it turns out this is an entirely different movie, actually one that is even more rare but also a whole lot worse.
I find that is blends occasional over-the-top humor with a complex and rich story that seems to genuine to be fiction.
(I love the scene in which Bogey and his blond moll are shown exiting a movie theatre that is playing "You Can't Get Away With Murder"...another Bogart picture from 1939!)
This has spectacular effects that help elevate things a couple of notches- Where else are you going to see a train try to out run a plane that is trying to bomb it?.
So give this one a ride unless they make one for the  Great Depression II from viewpoint of unemployed that is as that is the usual determinant.  
Powell & Loy make a great team, that is why they went on to make 14 films together, they have wonderful screen chemistry.
Powell & Loy make a great team, that is why they went on to make 14 films together, they have wonderful screen chemistry.
Some scenes even include interrupted dialogues, with the ensuing sudden shift of scenario that is somewhat off-putting.
FOOTNOTE:  The Spanish used is pure `Castillian' - that is, the most neutral and unregionalised, which will be of special interest to students of the Spanish language.
And as an American poet, who also read St. Theresa's autobiography, wrote -- "that is that, is that."
Then I realized, that is JUST what things look like midday.
Its just so mundane, and that is what will eventually strike you hard at the end if you just keep an open mind until you get there.
IMDb requires you to write @ least ten lines of comments and that is exactly what I am doing.
* The conversation at the captains table made perfect sense for me, given the babel that is India - 1000s of languages, yet holding together as a perfectly functioning anarcho-democracy!!!
Like the passage of our own life, it is the totality of the experience that is important, an experience that can only be reflected upon from a distance and weighed in the context of the events that are transforming the civilization and culture we once thought would never change.
Its a really dumb movie that is notable only for it being Hatton's final role.
Perhaps that is because "The Brute Man" seems contrived to exploit the commercial successes of "The Pearl of Death," "City Lights" and "Phantom of the Opera," from which it derives some of its main story elements (including the sentimental scenes with the blind girl and the theme of disfigurement and revenge).
It's a funny story about 3 guys out looking to get some weed and a cop that is messing around with them.
Aside from being very very very funny, they said, all the hell with it and made a good original comedy that is not going to remind you of anything else.
This is a rare gem, one that isn't afraid to confront what it means to grow up in 80s America.
Of course, the arrest and his deportation serves as the basis of a clever comedy that is easy on the eyes and have us laughing throughout the many funny situations Mr. Marin has created for himself and his crew.
A family that is constantly hoping and waiting for the father to publish a second great novel, the novel that will finally bring decent food on the table and acceptable clothes on their back.
During this maddening wait, Cassandra writes her most intimate thoughts and feelings in her diary and brings us along the roller-coaster ride that is the passage from childhood to womanhood.
In the picturesque 1930's English countryside "I Capture the Castle" tells the story of an eccentric family in a decrepit, murky and leaky old castle that is now a shadow of its former majestic self, as is the father of the family.
James has a past that the family neither wishes to remember nor can face seeing its reappearance (can't reveal what that is, can I?).
The acting is on the same cheesy level that is about the best that adult films can hope for.
!very campy, but fun, and the dolls have a personality of their own, that is crazy....  a bit over the top, but all in all not a bad b film; of the actors, all seem to be having a good time, with Warren Draper as the wimpy husband stealing every scene he is in until his gruesome death by the hands of the evil dolls....
Its hard to find a movie that is both so much fun to watch while being so terrible.
If you love everything that is bad about Full Moon go out and buy this movie today.
If that isn't strange enough seems the guy who wrote the book was a bit crazy and he even went so far as to say the book was not a work of fiction, but rather a true story.
this deranged killer was far more interesting and sadistic, (it seems they took ideas from jack the ripper with the killer in black with brief case and piercing eyes while walking round misty murky streets)) there is one scene near the beginning, a killing of an actress that is so bloody and gore fested that at 14 i threw up.
It has the logic of a dream - that is, no logic at all, - but don't see this one for the sake of the plot.
We also learn that James Dobson, one of the most indisputably renowned and respected evangelical Christian leaders in America, chairman of Focus On the Family, a nonprofit Christian organization, believes that homosexuality is a preference that is inspired through a child's surroundings.
I found nothing new scientifically in this film, but that is because i love reading about science and new all the facts that were expressed.
Those passages they quote are taken out of the cultural context of the period and just knowing that there is no Aramaic, Hebrew, or Ancient Greek word for homosexual should tell you that is not what they were talking about.
A total mess, though I do give it credit for trying to dip into different genres, but when you title your film "Drive-In Massacre," that is what you need to deliver!
Too much time is also spent on a father chasing his daughter that isn't really connected to the main story.
This leads to a funny conversation between the two cops and Atkins, Atkins says teenagers are dicks and one of the cops replies "well, I have two of them" referring to the two dead kids from the opening sequence, the other cop quickly buts in and says "teenagers that is!
This is one of those b-films which feel like they don't go anywhere, and this certainly something that is accurate about this one.
I watched this film on the belief that is was notoriously gory, what a mistake I made.
If I can count the deaths on one hand, that is unworthy of the term "massacre".
There are also at least three scenes that last for five minutes that is nothing but a guy driving around a parking lot looking for a place to park!!
We see every facet of the brilliant diamond that is Julie through Davis' superb acting.
There are one or two interesting scenes but that is about it.
This was not a movie that I particularly liked watching (perhaps it's just not my favorite genre) but it simply was one fine made movie, that is effective in basically everything it tries to achieve.
She is a moral imbecile but that too goes unremarked upon because everybody else in her world is one too and the only thing that is noticed about a human personality is material success i.e.
It is an acting style, and skill level, that isn't seen often.
This film explored the stuff that is as far back in the human consciousness that you don't even want to know is there.
I suppose that is an obvious statement but, in Crumb's case, fame has managed to gloss over many unacceptable characteristics.
Perhaps that is the film's enduring mystery.
He also maintains an honesty and a level of integrity that is just not seen these days, the exception being Dave Chapelle when he walked away from $50 million.
He is not much of a storyteller, but like I pointed out above, that is more than made up by the fact that he is always totally candid about his life, sometimes painfully and embarrassingly so.
The interview with Dian Hanson was hilarious, [does anybody have a copy of that issue].
The first half -- before the entre act, that is -- is a kind of late 18th-century soap opera.
In a relatively minor role as Shearer's one true love, Tyrone Power has a part that is familiar to devotees of these kinds of movies.
In the early scenes, before and after the attack, we see a crime-infested New York where violence is casual, everyday, all over - and a police force that is powerless.
Apparently the public loves him, and cops don't want to look really bad by not being to protect people and then arresting the one person that is fighting back and inspiring others to do the same.
Do not get me wrong I love Clint Eastwood and the entire Dirty Harry series but the series of events that Mr. Bronson had to endure was very very upsetting (like I was almost in the same room with Mr. Bronson feeling his pain, that is how good I think Michael Winner did in shooting this film).
that is because of the sheer knowledge of the director.. looking forward for the next creation of this great director
If you have any objections to humor that is far from wholesome, you should probably bypass this movie, unfortunately.
Is a similar case to other of Marty's films: Casino, because Casino is a masterpiece but a lot of people think that is a copy of Goodfellas......is the same.
Scorsese has a rapport with actors that is totally unique.
Dunne's character seems to be the only normal person in this film and that is one of the reasons why it works so well.
The film is completely over the top in every respect, but that is part of what makes it so compelling.
"After Hours" occupies an era that is pre-ATMs and cell phones, but there are Checker cabs, subway tokens, gritty artists' lofts, and rotary phones.
The tension in this film is also intense, and that is amazing for a light hearted comedy.
This is a terrific piece of film noir that is paying homage to the great detective mysteries of the forties.
I love the camp of the Godzilla movies that comes from this straight serious movie that is just unbelievable.
And that is the point of this movie, to remind every one of us who grew up on monster movies that in the midst of all the ALIEN-stylized cinematic drool, that the giant UFO perched menacingly over Tokyo, shimmering with mysterious electronic pulsations while Godzilla ( with an underwater swimming scene for Godzilla that is priceless) stomps in for a classic samauri-like duel with the alien craft and its occupant, with all the Man In Suit and b-movie special effects you can stand, is the reason why many of us "creature feature" lovers continue going to the movies TODAY, because we're looking for something like GODZILLA 2000.
Of course, since I never really cared for the people in a "Godzilla" movie and those feelings haven't changed, it must be pointed out here that the people have been drastically short-changed in favor of the all-out monster showdown that is the film's climax.
A seemingly impossible task that is complicated at the last minute and has some funny twists and turns is a joy to watch.
What's more odd about that is that, judging by this one and "Conqueror of Atlantis," his Peplum characters are some of the more ruthless ones, even breaking a (sort of) rule in these films, by having the hero get rid of the femme fatale character pretty directly (usually that happens some other way).
Andre De Toth a Hungarian by birth was renowned by all who knew him as a bit of character and a fun guy to be around, unless that is you were a producer at which point De Toth showed his argumentative side, a side of his character that saw him loose an eye in a pre war anti Nazi rally.
I just got this one on dvd and loved it.. With a lot of cool bonus stuff and a blooper reel that is to die for.. all i can say is "THE CHEESE THE CHEESE" BEST BLOOPER EVER..  As for the movie with it extended scenes was very well done.
We do not see a single kiss between this couple, yet Jed is bristling with passion that is uncontrollable.
In fact, the central thriller is downplayed compared to the book and this is not necessarily a bad thing, as that part of the story is relatively one-dimensional (in the way that thrillers often are), whereas it's the hinterland of this tale that is more ambiguous and interesting.
One that is actually hard to sell to potential first time viewers.
it's cold, very cold {something that is brilliantly enhanced by Haris Zambarloukos' photography}.
Samantha Morton does a fine job as Claire, something that is always the case.
The first scene is very promising, after that is one mistake after another.
"Changing Lanes" was about as substantial as a studio thriller can be; somebody ought to give this guy at a good, commercial chiller that isn't masquerading as anything else.
Daniel Craig does his best with the part of Joe; Rhys Ifans is reasonably good as Jed (my experience (as a lawyer) of stalkers is that they not generally as obviously barmy as Jed, but that is the fault of the script, not the actor); there's a good performance in a minor role by Bill Nighy.
She links up the Sebastian (Flynn), a musician, who also happens to have a brother that is in music too.
Saving Star Wars by Catherine Lee   One of the things that is most charming about Saving Star Wars is how simpatico I felt about so many of the opinions he expresses regarding the meaning and significance of Star Wars.
Director George Seaton delivers an entertainment movie that is enhanced by some unheard music by George and Ira Gershwin that is a delight to the ear.
Fresh and true look into what really happens to some teens as they try to transition from high school life to the reality that is the "real world".
However, I can't say I could relate to the dark world that is portrayed in Ghost World.
Enid and her friend are the main characters who think they are above everyone else, including the depressed guy that is Seymour.
Every single time I watch this movie I discover something new and that is why I keep watching it.
The plot is very simple but excellent and there are a lot of memorable dialogs and two memorable characters that makes this film as one of the most original films ever and that is, without a doubt, Terry Zwigoff's masterpiece.
Conclusion: i really love this film that is highly re-watchable and for me is one the best films of the 00's and amazingly original.
As L.A. Detective Sims, Hayden does just as much stealing as the bad guys he's trying to track down do - stealing every scene he's in that is.
In everything he just brings that "umph" that is required whether it's to a hoodlum or a psychotic or a corrupt cop, and in Crime Wave his authority as a presence (six foot five inches) and his pattern of speech play off well against the rest of the usual character actors, save maybe for Charles Bronson since he too is unique even at a young age and creepy character actor Timothy Carey as the man put on watch of Mrs. Lacey.
The story involving a girl who does not die during the twenty-minute gassing and is then revived and how the men argue over how to protect her from further harm, is intense and touching in that it shows the humanity that is still in their souls.
And in a way that is a very good way to watch a movie.
It makes sense that the Nazi's would have used Jews to dispose of other Jews...they were totally expendable, and it's very logical, and perhaps that is why it is so horrible.
I am Scottish but neither Asian or gay so others can discuss any significance about such matters, for me it was just a great watch and that is all I care about.
But if you love a romance, that is about love and what love should be, then this is a film for you.
While there was a successful TV Incredible Hulk series in the seventies, a never-released, low-budget "Fantastic Four" flick, and an *ahem* film version of "The Punisher" that is not even worthy of mention, at the end of the day, the only cinematic interpretations of their heroes that are worth commenting on at all are "Blade," "X-Men," and "Captain America."
it's one of those cheesy types that is so poorly done that you can't help but smile.
Even if Cap could have diverted the rocket launched at the White House by kicking the fin, and even if he could have survived the impact I really have trouble figuring out why a rocket that is supposed to only have to travel to Washington DC has enough fuel to get to Alaska.
I wonder if there is a category of movies that is BELOW low budget.
6 ppl is acting out a story that is just mindblowing.
All I had to do was crawl for about 15 feet and then walk right on, and that is exactly what I did.
Yet there seem to be no video or audio copy that is available.
Lana Turner is beautiful, but not sensual and her character seems too undefined to be really intriguing -that is until her demise.
It is interesting to see a film such as this, where no expense has been spared, with great MGM art direction and costume design, intriguing choreography and movement, the then novel CinemaScope cinematography, and realizing fairly quickly that is simply does not hold.
Along with Maya Gibbs (Raina-Simone Moore), a prostitute just getting into the game, the story degenerates into a slow pursuit filled with a combination of violence, pornography, and depravity that ends with the inevitable conclusion of the path of self-destruction that is Paris's life.
I could hear the audience around me squirm as the film edged towards a climax that is at once cruel, touching, and very, very powerful.
She hearkens back to a certain sort of "old time" elegance and glamour that is so lacking in movies these days.
But that isn't the last of their troubles.
Lightweight, certainly likable science-fiction fantasy that is good for the young crowd - in fact, it is okay for family viewing - but for me it was too slowly paced.
The film begins inside a surreal dream sequence, where a young boy Ben Crandell (Ethan Hawke's film debut) is flying above a circuit-board that is a dizzying array of colours, electrical flashes and breakers.
All in all a very powerful, and intense movie that is a must see
The three leads, Ethan Hawk, River Phoenix and Jason Presson do a fine job in the film, working with an excellent script that is both funny and bittersweet as well.
The sudden presence of a transnational company (that is ruthless, no matter if its officials claim the opposite) in those countries, where political corruption, greed and totalitarian methods helped to mine its social and economic system, has very little to laugh about.
finally a gory slasher movie that is comparable to the early eighties slashers.this remake kicks the crap out of the boring original that's for sure.hard to believe this was made buy the same guy that made that horrible comedy chainsaw massacre 2.tobe hooper has not made that many good movies besides this one there is the original chainsaw massacre and lifeforce.this movie has got some incredible and inventive gore scenes in it.the killer has a gory deformed face that kind of reminds me of the way darkman looks.no cgi in this movie at all and the location in the hotel is great dark and dreary.the return of the slasher film is here and it is called the tool box murders
According to the video box, it was the first full-length American-made film, but that is debatable--as several films have made that claim and exactly what constitutes "full-length" is pretty vague.
This movie also has a kooky supporting cast that is also well played out one that stands out in remembrance is the character of the weird and shy repairman, his look is that of a grungy, careless non responsible individual and often leads you to believe that HE could be the man behind the mask....is he?
But that is not all.
Because I like them, I fear for them, and that is what horror is about.
With a budget of less-than $1 million, Tobe Hooper has created a new classic horror that is likely to be imitated.
Gaps can be filled by a creative imagination and that is part of the beauty of cinema.
It's also been mentioned that is was Weissmuller who personally selected little John Sheffield, out of hundreds of candidates, for the role of Boy.
Phantom Raiders portrays a crime that is all to possible today, blowing up ships set off by electrical devices.
Good movie about gracious southern life mixed with a lot of behavior that is anything but gracious.
This is a great "woman's" picture that is also very entertaining for anybody.
Though certainly an unpleasant subject, people should realize that this is a real technique that is used upon unwilling people to cause them to be subjective to other people "the masters".
This is one of those movies that is one of a kind, but not one you'd want to watch very often for it hits deep within our souls(especially those who have gone thru similar experiences) and therefore I think it failed when released because the exec's didn't know how to sell it to make money but none-the-less it is a classic in my book on relationships.
All this surrounds a equestrian competition that is supposed to bring these people together.
When it can offer its citizens a higher standard of living, they will no longer feel compelled to risk their lives and be exploited in a neighboring land that is trying to deal with its own economic and social issues.
This reality is true and that is where the movie's force comes from - the reality of these illegal immigrants.
As I said before this film will open your mind and will be enjoyed that is why I recommend it.
But, even that is not enough to maintain an interest to the end.
Carlitos has made friends with Dona Carmen, a lady that is in charge of the 'coyotes' that bring illegal Mexicans across the border, for a price.
Now I have seen more than my shares of bad acting in low budget movies, but Dorothy's acting although rough around the edges, still have more room to grow, that is, if she was to allow to develop her skill.
His investigation leads him to a mysterious and beautiful young woman, played by Vera Farmiga in a performance that is going to get her a LOT of work in the film biz.
While Vinnie struggles with the concept of mowing the lawn, Steve Martin flubs Brooklynese, massacring the entire dialect so incomprehensibly that the average affectionado of the tongue of Kings (Kings County that is) couldn't fathom a word Martin was trying to say.
His co-star, Rick Moranis, plays just about the same character as in "Honey, I shrunk the kids" and its sequels, so that is not really interesting to watch either but I would rather see a whole movie with that character again and the rather lame love story between him and Joan Cusack than spend it watching Martin squint and squirm his way through every stereotypical mannerism we associate with Wise's.
Overall an entertaining, bit of underrated comedy, that is fun to watch, mainly thanks to Martin and Moranis who were both in top shape at the time of this movie.
It lacks the intelligence of "When Harry Met Sally" (another Ephron written film) but that isn't needed in this movie.
Easy,breezy comedy directed by the late Herbert Ross and penned by Nora Ephron(who seems to be a much better screenwriter than director),it's a film that is as light as air on a subject not normally broached in this manner(even Analyze This!
His response is a four-letter-word that isn't nearly as (c)rude as it seems it would be at first.
This is comic perfection from beginning to end, and not even the dismal, dislikable, annoying Diane Keaton (what IS it that is so off-putting about her?)
Worst episode of the series this far, 'Bugs' didn't make anything, no scary impact, already seen story, a story that is made for big and long movies, all that "houses built on the old Indian graveyard" kind of thing that used to work sometimes, but it definitely didn't work out for 'Supernatural' series.
Perhaps that is because the entire cast does a job I find enjoyable.
The series itself does however contain some sexual humor that is structured rather uniquely to simply pass over young children's heads.
There's a villain that lives in a magic videotape that is trying to steal every shade of color.
If you are looking for a horror film or a movie that is going to offer some thrills, try another movie.
"Standard Operating Procedure" doesn't successfully address all the questions it sets out to answer, but that is hardly a weakness of the film, since it is dealing with a complex, messy situation involving complex, messy people caught up in a complex, messy war.
The clear context of the crimes against humanity that is so off putting and mainly off camera is contrasted with inviting film work that draws us into this story.
The sparkling "I'll Be Hard to Handle" is first introduced by Ginger singing in a mock foreign accent, then she and Fred execute a joyous tap dance that is part of a rehearsal.
A monoplane begins a bombing run that is concluded by a biplane.
Def Con 4 is one of those movies that is pretty much unique in the world of B grade cinema.
There is some over top emoting from the lead actors that is slightly lame, but overall a good relic from the cold war.
In summary, it's a good bad movie that is more good than bad.
I admire the fashionable production and the team so much because they knew what they were doing to the audience too: presenting a sublime musical confection that is exquisite enough to make the viewer pass out from aching satisfaction.
Randolph Scott has a big, clean, very handsome, American quality that is also wonderfully suited to this part - one in which his character is candid, straightforward, easily swayed by others who are sophisticated -but at a certain point will act decisively when he comes to realize his judgment has been mistaken.
In a work where chases predominate it is the pursuit by Holly Martins for the affection of Anna Schmidt, Lime's lover, that is at the real heart of things.
"The Third Man" is a flawless film of intrigue and suspense, a summit of perfection within the genreÂ It is one of the most literate thrillers ever madeÂ It is superb1y acted by an ensemble working in an understated, effortless styleÂ Its cinematography includes some of the best black-and-white work ever doneÂ Its score of haunting zither music is still remembered, instantly familiar to anyone who ever saw the film, and now thorough1y identified with most people's impressions of ViennaÂ Finally, the direction by Carol Reed is exemplaryÂ Rarely has a motion picture represented the collaboration of so many exceptional talents... "The Third Man" may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War IIÂ   The night city terrain of "The Third Man" is unique: occupied postwar Vienna, baroque, bombed-out, decadent, patrolled by Jeeps containing representatives of the four occupying powers, an American, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a RussianÂ  Corrupt, world-weary people hang about its fringes: the overly suave Rumanian, Popescu; the frayed violinist, Baron Kurtz; the atheistic collector of Catholic antiquities, Dr. Winkel; Crabbit, the tired head of the Anglo Cultural Center; and Anna Schmidt, the Czechoslovakian girl friend of Harry Lime, an obscure actress with forged papersÂ   Moving among them are three extraordinary principals, Holly Martins, a typical Greene creation; a hack American writer; a used- up second-rater; Colonel Calloway, a Scotland Yard type, chief of British Military Police; and Harry Lime (WeIles), the corrupt two-bit racketeer, a fully immoral, totally unreachable villainÂ   These characters wander through rain-slick night streets, in and out of shabby cafÃ©s, over the rubble of bombed-out buildings, even into a terrain vague dominated by a huge Ferris wheelÂ  The Vienna of "The Third Man" is a vast city that seems emptyÂ Its streets are always damp, and water rushes through a system of sweet-smelling sewers underneathÂ It is a world of slinking cats and biting parrots, of people taking advantage of each other without pityÂ   "The Third Man" meets the test of complexityÂ The characters interact, their stories conflict: A man who is supposed to be dead turns up alive, there is a question of whether two men or a "third man" carried off Lime's "body," there are conspiracies, deceits, and double crossesÂ   Reed owes debts to Fritz Long for some of his ideas: the geometrical shots, the montage of evidence, Welles' whistling, etc., but Reed has his own original visual style, particularly his use of a slightly tilted camera to produce so-called "Chinese angles," employed to project danger, foreboding, a twisted universeÂ He is also capable of providing suspense in the tradition of HitchcockÂ   "The Third Man" is unique in the genre for its realismÂ Despite the complexities of plot, the characters are understandable, dimensional, emotionally genuineÂa tribute to the fine ensemble playing and special, low-keyed acting style that is the cinematic equivalent of Graham Greene's writingÂ  Carol Reed was knighted for his excellence as a British filmmaker, and for a body of work that is notable for its good tasteÂ It is this taste, of course, that works so well in "The Third Man," but which has destroyed some of his other films, such as "Our Man in Havana," which require a certain amount of excess to make them workÂ
Never before has a city taken center stage in the development of the story that is presented here.
This doco looks at a band that is still actively recording, and by no means at the end of their career.
One of the characters ends up stark naked in public and even that is not funny.
I really liked this movie and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of Vincent Perez and who also likes good French films.
It is 1962 and with less than 1500 US MAAG advisors in Vietnam, Lancaster is buried in a dead end assignment deep in country that is supposed to be a"low intensity" combat zone,  After being ordered to send a green LT, some mercs and ruffpuffs and a burntout NCO on a senseless mission to a deserted former French Army camp at Muc Wa, Lancaster finds his team has created a major concentration of VC and he's going to have to go in and bring them out.
"London After Midnight" is perhaps the most sought after movie, that is presumed lost.
It's a flat and far from engaging way of film-making, that is not always easy to watch.
On the other hand, Hardy can show a serious edge that is not frequently seen in his comedies with Stan Laurel.
But the movie and actor both appear to be actually taking themselves seriously, and the result is something that is just dreadful to watch.
With easy access to the bombs he intends to bribe the Government into paying a ransom or he'll use them to wipe out half of the country, that is unless Hale & the park ranger can stop him & his men...
Choreography is another part that is poorly done.
As the plot takes shape the audience realizes that they are watching a movie that is jam-packed with terrific special effects and a wonderful combination of subtle and audacious humor (with its own off-the-wall style).
The thing that is so great, is that his character is hateful and charismatic at the same time.
No one has yet been able to identify which story that is, indicating the film either was going the Blair Witch route in trying to lend itself credibility, or else was conceived after hearing something about some man who tried to kill some naked girl somewhere.
In fact, the part of the movie that is about the one rogue cop who tries to catch the real killer is so irrelevant to the plot that I'm not even sure why they included it.
This film is an effective, touching work that is mostly autobiographical, yet exaggerated to provide laughs and insight on the difficulties of show business.
But even that is well done!
A low-budget Old Dark House mystery that is better than it needs to be, with sharp dialogue and engaging characters...can't go wrong!
My only quibble is the inevitable 'woman gives up her own life for a man' scenario that is so much a part of 30's, 40's and 50's cinema post-code.
It is of course a romantic comedy, but one that is hilarious even today.
His Girl Friday is one of the rare comic films that is not only hilarious but actually changed how films are made (or at least written).
This is a smart movie, it has plenty of plot and character development, it has great strong characters, it makes commentary on the newsbusiness then that is relevant to the newsbusiness today and sarcastically shares the modern view of government I think, as well.
This is a classic movie that is perhaps timeless.
While Grant is no sleepwalker and puts to work his skills at being charming and amusing while also playing a conniving persona, Russell puts everything she's got into a character that is probably far stronger than Bruce can take and is just about an even match for Walter Burns's double-crossing.
Just make no mistake, this isn't a comedy that is based on the actors for most of the support.
The poor man gets waylaid and involved in all kinds of intrigue that is all going on over his head.
Mr. Grant as Walter Burns, the unscrupulous newspaper editor, is the perfect foil for Rosalind Russell's, Hildy Johnson, a role that is played by a male in the original play and in the other film versions.
Dreamers rejoice in the chaotic joy that is "The Wizard of Speed and Time!"
Director Howard Hawks wanted to show the whirlwind pace of the newsroom in the criminal courts system so he had his actors overlap their lines -- so much so that at times it seems as though everyone is talking at once; it even gets difficult to understand all that is going on.
You might consider this to be a movie that is more appealed to a more teen audience.
But those small drawbacks aren't enough to take away from the genius that is Salvation.
Especially Turkish people should see it as soon as possible, that is because this movie is referred to the Turkish audience firstly.
There is a lull about 2/3rds into the movie that is hard to ignore.
Music, a handsome wolf, and a depth of plot that is hardly ever seen in a story that was once so basic.
However what you will remember best is that Treasure Island pirate theme song of the serial about 'gold doubloons and pieces of eight' that is guaranteed to rattle around in your brain for weeks upon hearing it.
And that is all it has going for it.
The story is surrounding a little village that is led by 3 families.
I recently watched this anime for the first time and initially wasn't sure what to make of it; I'd heard that is was a horror story but the animation style and opening episodes gave little suggestion of what was to come apart from the short pre-credit sequence in the first episode.
It is because of the plot that I chose the summary line "it grows on you" and I think that is a good thing.
The scene itself is neither visually explicit nor sexual, but it does imply an impropriety that is both offensive to the majority, and probably illegal "in the real world" (as opposed to the film set).
Thus, we get frequent extremely dull conversations about the defection of Hess, the progress of the Wehrmacht, and anti-Nazi sentiments amongst the German intelligentsia, and not nearly enough time devoted to the lesbianism, sado-masochism, violence and extreme decadent behaviour that is normally associated with the genre (although a hilarious nymphomaniac and a female Hitler impersonator do try their best to liven up proceedings).
Neither preachy, nor condescending, Mr. Shyamalan guides this film through to a resolution that is more surprising in how deftly it's handled than in how well it resolves the questions raised.
It is hard to find a quality movie that is able to invoke such an emotional response.
If you want to laugh and watch a movie that is so completely underrated that I want to complain, then please go, buy a copy, rent one, what ever you have to do to be able to see this hilarious movie.
I was surprised to see that is has an R rating for sexuality Â as there is just one sex scene, fairly short and honestly the movie would have been even better if it wasn't in it.
Good performances, too, from everybody in a film that is largely undervalued, certainly in this country where we are inclined to acknowledge our 'heroism' but draw the line at going beyond that, as this film does, somewhat uncomfortably.
And while House of a 1000 corpses didn't make me scared for my life it definitely captured that 70s vibe and quality that is missed by so many of these films.
The outsiders will die, someone will lose his legs, and that is it.
It is nice to see such a good horror film, better to see if you know the background, that is real story on which this film is made.
His deranged stepfather executes the sheriff that is going to arrest Thomas, and assumes his identity, wearing his clothes, driving his car though the roads in Texas and entitling himself as Sheriff Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey).
I can't decide if that is a good thing or not or intentional on the directors part to perhaps keep the mysterious aura of Leatherface intact.
If you love gore, suspense, terror, and the symbol of all that is just plain wrong then The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning is just your slasher!
It's nice to see a franchise splatter film that is intense and gory without being cheesy.
This movie made me feel real sorry for one of the old ladies that is trying to get a date.
Give me an ending that is just as suspenseful as the rest of the show was.
We are introduced to a character, Frank Keller, that just achieved 20 years in service, that can't see really something after the retirement (that is what he hears of a lot, about the retirement) and that not long before he had a divorce (one the guys from his job is now with his ex-wife.
Sea of Love is an entertaining film with a first part that is simply that, a fast-paced entertainment and a second part that, like I said, is predictable, with a sexy Barkin and with really bad scenes (for instance take the supermarket supposedly very sexy scene, very bad music is what stands out in that part!).
Keller is contacted by a Det.Sherman, John Goodman, From the 112th police precinct in Richmond Hills Queens of a murder in that area that is very similar to the one he's investigating; A man shot dead with a bullet in the back of his head as he lay naked in bed, even the same song "Sea of Love" was still playing on his record player.
Some of my friends thought this is one of those films that is great the first time you see it, but diminishes after that because the heavy suspense questions have been answered.
An honest character study that is fearless in finding humor in certain racial stereotypes.
Much has been made of the bath scene but that is actually one of the least radical parts of this film.
The movie covered every issue that is concerning today's issues like history,race,sex and religion.
If you want to watch a movie that is close to MÃ¨xico's reality watch Valentin Trujillo's "El Perro Callejero".
What better way to tap into viewer emotions than to have a 10-year-old tenderly kiss a grown woman - it's an idea that is guaranteed to evoke strong feelings!
Like other movies by him, art and commercial form of cinema are merged to produce a movie that is still looked upon as a benchmark.
To me this film showed that the general image about Moroccans that is spread in Holland can be true, but isn't always, and that there are always different stories for different people.
is a serious movie but all the layers around it make it a very fun one that is filled with some good laughs.
It seems that within Taguchi's disk seems to contain a horrific virus that is spreading rapidly, causing mass suicides all throughout Tokyo.
It is malevolent in ways that is only hinted at, as the dead feed off the life-force of those who are alive and literally turn them into ash.
So far in the Asian movie re-makes I have yet to see a movie that is as compelling in a thriller or a horror as the Asian version.
Bright is chillingly effective, registering an intensity that is somewhat unsettling, and the supporting turns--which, with limited material flesh out characters, build histories and express emotions that the screenplay only implies--are sterling, especially in the case of Bacall and Howard.
Two things are worth noting: Harris Savides' wonderful cinematography (there are at least three iconic sequences in the film), which creates a look and a mood that is at once foreboding and exquisitely beautiful, and Alexandre Desplat's splendid score, which underscores the drama without becoming obtrusive and blends symphonic melodies with a hi-lo undercurrent that creates an odd womb-like effect.
This film is so non-American in it's pace and core that that is what might turn off some viewers, but that's what I loved about it.
It is not linear or logical and it doesn't explain everything that is going on, but it doesn't have to.
It starts with an implausible autobiography that is more than slightly self serving to Audie Murphy and has the same elements of self delusion that haunted Murphy throughout his adult life, namely that he was a lunatic with a terrible temper.
It could just as easily been Murphy as any of the cast that is killed and doesn't make it to the end of the film.
And that is what defines the director's fault in this case.
I had always thought that because South American countries, with the exception of Brazil, speak Spanish then it seemed that national boundaries would play only a minor role; but as becomes clear in part two that is most certainly not the case.
Soderbergh's choices of camera angles, perspective, lighting and all the cinematic aspects give you a permanent first person angle in the action that is so involving that you actually die with Che in the end of the second movie...
So in terms of historical accuracy Che falters and ultimately that leads to the dearth and want of something a little more cerebral and provocative rather than an exercise in cinematic and narrative technique, however laudable that is.
Mainly two facets, Benicio del Toro did simply a remarkable work, we see Ernesto Guevara in Mexico and certainly Fidel Castro, chronologically that is the first part of the film, the beginning in Mexico City.
Here he has done something very important, and that is to make a movie out of someone's life that is not strictly a biopic and has concerns outside the desire to essentialize the life into a narrative.
So like most of those that have come before it, Che is a movie that is best appreciated under no pretence; this is a history lesson disguised as film, and while it does tell a good story, those looking for entertainment best look away.
Plus, coupled with a performance that never begs for attention but instead simply plays the man he's supposed to be portraying with no overt padding, Del Toro goes a long way to giving Che the right amount of conviction that is needed to keep thing interesting and dynamic.
There is a third part, a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of Che's speech at the United Nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time, but that is inter-cut in the first segment.
The film is not all that well known today, and that is probably because it is rather derivative of other and better known westerns; most obvious is the climatic shootout sequence towards the end which directly 'borrows' from Sergio Leone's masterpiece The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.
An Mexican outlaw, with the help of a hired Polish gunslinger go out to make an massive rebellious army to take back what they believe is an poorly treated Mexico that is run by crooked and rich upper-class folk.
Jack Palance is Curly, an obviously gay bad guy, whose prissy demeanor hides his ruthlessness- that is until he kills his own partner out of spite and blows a few men's heads off.
That being said, since that is exactly what I was looking for - I wasn't disappointed.
John agrees to do the unachievable to make Joey happy, and this strive for success inspired by another person is something that is touching and remarkable.
It is so real, so human and it portrays something that is so close to our hearts.
For all the crap that Final Fantasy VIII got by not being a 'fantasy' game, it truly is a unique and outstanding game that is undeniably unforgettable in the best selling video game Final Fantasy series.
Occasionally such a team (the old Brooklyn Dodgers of the 1920s - 1930s or the original New York Mets comes to mind) do have such a following, but that is a rarity.
It is also refreshing that the movie does not have the typical Hollywood ending, but instead one that is fitting for the team sponsored by Chico's Bail Bonds.
Her friend Dona (Lona Andre) is a manicurist in a beauty salon that is a front for criminal activities.
Framing same-sex marriage as the next great civil rights challenge, Saving Marriage navigates the long, complicated political and legislative process with a human context, giving a face to a topic that is often eschewed as empty political rhetoric.
This documentary should also be a must-see for any straight married couple - it may make them stop taking their union and each other for granted - after all, it's a right that is not afforded to all.
As a heterosexual female that is involved in protecting the rights of people, I know how hard it's really been for me to display to the other's that are not gay, the importance of how something that you may feel isn't so important and does not affect you, can really affect other people.
As a former supporter of the notion of civil unions I now realize that is simply a term of appeasement, not a term of equality.
After time you learn to accept and forget the want to say in front of your loved ones and the world that you are gong to marry the man you love and be able to legally call someone your husband though that is what I call my boyfriend now.
This is also a film that is filled with passion and as you watch you heart fills with pride.
This movie will make us realize how important that is.
But despite meaning to reform, he always seemed to find himself playing the rotter--that is until he ultimately joins the military and makes something of his wasted life.
Excellent acting, an involving and interesting script and a nice way to make a wartime propaganda film that isn't obvious or ultra-jingoistic.
(that is, a tendency towards sincerity and immediacy), and of creating mythical or at least legendary representations of fatalist machismo and coolness, in a cheap and tooÂexplicit way.
Meanwhile the decorated soldier and ex-con driver of the Western Florists van Joe Rolfe (John Payne) that is delivering flowers in the shop is framed.
This is a suspenseful, atmospheric film noir that is well worth checking out.
Yet, we find in the film both an historic thread that is well built, as well as a good coverage of specific subjects and messages like sex, death, violence, etc.
This was not a corny VH1 type of special but rather a heartfelt tip of the hat to a culture that is still going on with teenagers and with us slightly older folks.
It is a film that is at once scattered in it's presentation but also held together by it's topic.
Not only does it take place in a world we can believe and understand (a somewhat futuristic world that is fairly peaceful but still militarized), but it features characters we can feel akin to, for the first real time in the FF Series.
He focuses on the US and Norway, but that is just a little piece of the big picture.
Unlike 1988' The Decline II: "The Metal Years" disaster while a big deal at the time, it still remains a brutal "cringe-fest" from start to finish and focused on predominately one style (Glam)one era (The 80s) one location(Sunset Strip) and barely covers the period of Heavy Metal that is STILL alive and well: thrash, black, speed,etc   I would have never guessed that a film about Heavy Metal would take serious the attitudes, styles, individuals,genres and provide a clear history time-line unlike Decline and any others of that ilk.
On the other hand, Dunn and his people actually do get some material here that is more precious, and more enlightening.
Given the small number of people who have rated this movie, I must conclude that this "mini"-series is not well known at all, but the people who have seen it may be interested in what I am going to point out: I saw it in December 2004, that is to say 6 months before "Lost" was aired on TV in western Europe.
The problem I saw with that is that radium occurs only in trace amounts in uranium and must be processed and refined to collect radium.
The task is retrieving a black box, that isn't your run of the mill black box like what is found in air planes, this one has a very powerful secret.
I opened this write up with a funny line spoken by Robert Redford because having just finished the film I feel all jolly, and that is a priceless thing after watching one of the most suspenseful films ever!
Yes, the political agenda is impossible to miss(and the very end is almost insulting), but that is not surprising, given Redford's involvement.
Normally, I would not be interested in a film that is summarized as a "complex... thriller about computers and cryptography, government and espionage."
It is, perhaps, the last good "hacker" film (well, 23 (1998) also comes to mind, but that isn't widely available in English).
As for those that say it was boring, like all first seasons the show was developing a direction and was positioned for a killer second season (before they butchered it without giving it a chance to grow that is).
The production and writing staff seemed to keep the Alphan basics as: "that is possible before the new millennium."
A great cast that is thoroughly wasted.
And a heart-surgery scene that is not for the squeamish.
This subplot, needless to add, is the only part of the film that isn't hilarious.
And what else can we put in this movie, yes, one young hot girl that is a car mechanic.
Yes, I have heard that that is a really good idea.
The movie is a well made and well acted costumer--employing all that is best about Warner Brothers films of the era.
But it's "The Prince And The Pauper" (1876) that is recalled as Twain's "twin story".
There is not one thing about this movie that is good.
It is also the only one of the 3 that is in 2.35:1.
John Cusak has a really strong performance the kind that is brilliant in a way that never gets noticed.
Hitchcock once said you should never lie to an audience, you should never show something that isn't true.
As each character dies, that is one less personality he has left.
Natalie Wood (8) plays a fine adopted daughter from Europe with an Austrian accent that is quite believable.
Hmmmm , maybe that is telling in itself when it comes to our beloved public servants, but I shall digress.
but this movie is simply rubbish: poor, senseless plot; flat characters, that is boring stereotypes (sharp contrasts to eizenshtejn's "tipazhi"); pseudo-cool, stupid dialogues.
The violence and shoot-outs are excessive but maybe that is the way it happens over there.
As we can see from the plot, it is kind of a fairy-tale that is transformed into the RP(Russian-Power) action flick.
And while that is probably no surprise, what got me was the constant examples of how we were portrayed.
However, it's the music that is especially beguiling.
All in all, this is one fine episode, thanks primarily to the acting that is on display here.
He creates a sense of claustrophobia that is unprecedented in the film industry.
There is also something about the power of a film that isn't afraid to be honest to itself.
It is the story of the sinking, in 1841, of the William Brown - the same shipwreck that is the subject of Henry Hathaway's movie SOULS AT SEA (1937) that starred Gary Cooper, George Raft, and Henry Wilcoxen.
He is unable to rely on anyone else - a fact that is brought to his attention not only by the actions of a critical Stephen Boyd at one point, but by the way Mai Zetterling and James Hayter distance themselves from him when the lifeboat is finally picked up.
But that is part of what gives Seven Waves Away its wallop.
Dennis the Menace is among the few films on the video shelf that is able to keep the entire family amused.
Dennis the menace only got 4.7. and that is unacceptable.
Beverly Hills Cop 2 was released in May of 1987, and so came just after things like Top Gun, Police Academy 3, The Color of Money, To Live and Die in L.A. (which was sort of an anti-buddy cop movie with a mean streak that is clearly reflected in Cop 2), Eddie Murphy's own The Golden Child, and the original Lethal Weapon, which was released just a few months earlier and may have been sharing theaters with it.
She's involved with a ruthless organized crime syndicate that is running firearms to Central America, and when police chief Bogomil is gunned down, Foley decides he's going to head on back to southern California to solve the case himself again.
I just that that is was totally funny, its one of the funniest movies that I have seen in a couple of years, but it is not the funniest movie that I have ever seen.
I can only hope my words can express even a fraction of the horror that is watching this.
2 killed the series, but that is absolute nonsense.
They happen to have a rather lame weakness that is really quite easy for anyone to use.
Enter the pseudo-heroic shy, fashion-victim soft-rocking boyfriend and a horror movie fan that is the only one who really investigates what is going on (Natalie spends a lot of time by the swimming pool when she's not going ga-ga for the boyfriend), and someone finally realizes that, oh yeah, there's these things and they're wreaking havoc on our city.
This is one of those little obscure and ridiculous yet fun horror movies from the eighties.The basics.Someone is going around committing horrid murders,turns out it's a gang of strange creatures that live underneath the Golden Gate bridge.What are these creatures?Why are they there?Well that is never answered.They are either humanoid or zombie looking.You have one that looks like a zombie solider,a weird apeman looking thing,a strange Native American monster and a few others.It also just so happens these creatures can be killed with water(why would something that is endangered by water live under a bridge?
The film lacks any kind of themes or substance, meaning that it will both not please serious film fans, and that this reviewer is running out of steam; but I will say that this movie does have a point to make, and that is simply entertaining it's audience.
Fleischer's snappy SUPERMAN franchise is as good as I expected it to beÂthat is, charming and brisk, exciting, thrilling and one of the most delightful cartoons availableÂin the form of these mindÂblowing greatÂlooking short installments.
While the story is not going to win an Academy Award, every line that is spoken in this movie is part of a joke, NO FILLER!
In short, it's a find that is quite a stroke of luck; the film was believed lost until rediscovered just in time for the DVD collection set, and for fans it's a minor delight.
In the end, this is just a very funny movie that is well-made and memorable - much more so than some of its other 1990s "stupid-comedy" counterparts.
7:45   Need I say more... this film has it all comedy comedy comedy... that is all you need.
Dumb and Dumber is a stupid movie, but what some people don't understand is that is what it is supposed to be!
He begins by assuming a new personality that is just the opposite of his old self.
Vitus is a wonderful film that is linear, magical, and groundbreaking in the musical genre.
This is one of those films that is very misleading w/it's cover & even it's basic explanation of what it's about.
Vitus faces a decision that I assume most prodigies face, and that is how much of their lives should be devoted to developing their gift.
This is a great setup for a rich final payoff that is totally squandered in the final third where Vitus starts playing the stock market in order to save his father's job.
His methods are more devious than that and involve night vision film-making, Egyptian methods of mummification, and a performance of "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" that is redesigned as if composed by Bartok.
There is really only one scene that could actually be worth seeing again and that is the shootout in the beginning.
The brothers' lifestyle may be conservative, but they run an organization that is fully intertwined with the present day social, political and economic life of Turkey.
But that is politics right?
at bringing Lovecraft to the screen, something that is notoriously difficult to do.
It makes for a potent combination that is somewhat silly but great fun to look at.
I tend to think that Peter Fonda would have been a little too "slick" for this role, that is, too much on the side of the sleazy seducer and too little on the side of the menacing necromancer.
I am sure that is not the makers of this movies intent.
second one is the one scene that contains an explosion and where the cgi effects are VERY bad( while that is not important to the plot at all, somehow will affect your impression and visual perceptions since the suspense about around there is great- kind of a "let down" for a few moments).
Many reviews have alluded to the fact that is a pretty obvious rip-off of "The Usual Suspects".
Following these heroic acts, Alyosha is granted a six day leave and takes it upon himself to return home in hope to complete an errand that is embedded at his family's house in the roof requiring mending.
The film follows a logical progression of events that lets the viewer absorb the contents in easy to swallow doses, that is, as long as he/she pays attention to the plot development.
But I think that is exactly what happened.
(I have all 24 episodes on tape)  The special effects were near the late 70's level of "Star Wars", and that is truly saying something considering this was a made for TV movie / weekly series.
Perhaps that is why this movie must be significant.
And with it, I think Chukrai deserves a place alongside the early masters of Soviet film, that is, before the Stalinist tyranny descended.
The Storyville brothels were eventually shut down and that is depicted as well.
Fans of outstanding black and white photography will enjoy this film as that is the best feature.
Why does everybody cut this movie down just for the nudity that is in it?
It will grab your heart, it will make you want to live each day to the fullest, it will reinforce the importance of love within you, it will remind you of one simple fact: 'memento mori' is a maxim we all need to keep in mind, but there is another one that is so much more important: 'memento vitae' - remember that you are alive!
But it's an important work nonetheless, and one that is really hard to forget or ignore once finished.
Most people won't even remember the cartoons - but that is not to say that they aren't food.
Boasting a superb lead performance by Patrick DeWaere as a young Frenchman battling to stifle the seductive advances of his breathtakingly beautiful step-daughter, it is grounded by fascinating character detail and an intelligent, focused script that is deeply interested in the complexities of love and desire.
I just watched the episode where a family friend makes a pass at Mallory, and that is something that some young people have to deal with.
The answer to that is more or less yes.
Although my Russian is as limited as possible, the emotion that is portrayed by the vocalizations of the actors, is powerful.
This is a film that is very close to my heart.
On the positive side, Robin Williams appears in this film in a role that is suited for him and that he plays in a restrained and powerful way.
In fact they know him for more than 10 years, yet nobody knows that he is the son of the second villain that is supposed to be dead.
Well that isn't a big surprise - it could not be any other way if Lady Snowblood is to fulfill her life's purpose - what is a big surprise is that a man who staged his own death and knows there is a woman out to get him just comes out of hiding to inform a man, who is obviously close to his enemy, that he is alive.
This turns out to be an Oliver Twist wannabe that isn't even close to the latter in quality and believability.
We want something that is a little bit "stupid," sometimes.
I know people just go around saying that about any show that they don't like or that is bad, "this is the worst show ever", but in this case I really truly mean it.
If she was supposed to be a sympathetic character, it never showed and that is too bad because Hershey is an accomplished actress and this movie doesn't help her career.
Adolfo Celi gives a performance of Rodrigo Borgia that is SUPBERB.
I can't really say what that is about.
At first the plot of this movie might seem to move along too slowly, but that is simply to establish the characters and setting of the movie which is something that has to be done to fully appreciate this movie.
The characters are oddly unpredictable, and are like multi layered onions, many people might just look it and observe that is it just another gay movie, but it is not, it is so much more than that.
There is no happy ending here, you can bet that, but at least you get a real story that is more appropriate to the times.
Overall, this is an absolutely great film and one that is a must see for anyone that considers themselves a Pinky Violence fan!
It is difficult when making a film to stay true to the book, and that is why i believe that this version of Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest films ever made.
She is raped by one of the gang members and dies giving birth to the daughter that is the product of her union with the rapist.
My only "suggestion" would have been to throw in some gratuitous sex and nudity that is more typical of the pinky films, and then LADY SNOWBLOOD would have been damn-near perfect.
At last, a work of Jane Austen's that is presented on film as faithfully as it was imagined in the theatre of my mind.
It is a fantastic love story that is witty, charming, and very funny.
Now, for me, that is one of the most sexy and sensual scenes I have ever seen.
If you can manage that, you will discover this to be a charming little film that is well worth watching.
A genuine piece of cinematic gold that is also entertaining and worth a watch.
If you need to see something that is truly unique, albeit with 'classic' elements telling and showing the story, Man of the Century is it.
The film is brilliantly photographed, the wonderful cinematography as well as the sceneries and choreography hold a beauty that is surpassed only by that of the ravishing heroine herself.
The beauty of this movie is that is original and entertaining.
The atmosphere is chilling, carefully established and maintained throughout, by the grisly sights and the incredibly well-done and meticulously crafted sound-side that is either shocking or hinting, never noisy or dull.
), a wide range of animations and rather articulated faces and the like(I do not personally find the introductory movie as compelling as the other two, perhaps that is only me... it might be the pop song, if I will grant that it's sufficiently sad in tone).
The button for this can get you third person view, and that is invaluable in this.
I still can't figure out why any self-respecting person would ever attempt to make a film that is as stupid as In The Woods.
Yet, in the end, miraculously he overcomes his naivetÃ©, but realizes that "the beast continues to exist in the forest," and that is the nature of "the forest" (of life).
The effects are dated, the actors look unfashionable and the locations look dated but that isn't unexpected.
You will probably drop out of college or high school once you behold the magic that is Angel Of Death (aka Commando Mengele).
You'll see everything evolve through the decades and follow it all through the eyes of the Carati's, a family that isn't spared of any fortune or bad luck...
I have seen many movies last year and this is the one that is close to my heart.
It is refreshing to see an Italian movie that is not centered around the mob.
Luckily, for the cinematic wimps among us, "The Best of Youth" has arrived in a format - namely, a two-disc DVD set - that is far more reasonable and sensible given the episodic nature of the material and our own limited attention spans.
To say this is a miniseries is misleading and adds the impression of a "cheese" factor that is not present.
It looks like the only lesson that the previous genocides of the last century has taught us, is that if there's going to be genocide, get on the side that is committing it and make sure that your interests are secured...  Bravo to Dallaire for having the courage and cojones to return to Rwanda and to give us his outstanding and this astonishing and important documentary.
In another fantastic documentary, "Born into Brothels," one of the children says something to the effect of "I like this picture, though it is sad, we have to look at it because that is the way she lives and it is truth."
With us, that is ... not necessarily with those actually living in the time depicted.
Yet their regard for each other transcends everything that is thrown at them -- from his raging self-doubt, to the royal court's machinations and violence, to her being obsessed with acting technique at the expense of creating passion and fire.
they all make mistakes, and that is true in real life.
Some of the supporting characters (with the notable exceptions of the terrific Tom Wilkinson and Ben Chaplin) were kind of thin but that is a minor complaint.
The one most effective element is Rupert Everett's performance as Charles II, his best - an that is saying a lot - in many, many moons.
Surprisingly, these two men have been able to create a film that is not only visually satisfying, but it also is an adult entertainment.
Well don't, because it also happens to make a highly successful transition from stage to screen thanks to the genius that is director Richard Eyre.
Bottom line, we live in the here and now, making the best of bad or less-than-ideal life circumstances, and that is where this family seemed to land.
In other words, the sacrifice of Nick's life for the miracle that is growing in Julie's womb.
Ms. Otto's face projects an intelligence that is uncanny.
She makes us believe that she is this woman torn between the medicine that might help her young son, but does nothing, and to what extreme, as a mother, she will go to have Nick cured of the cancer that is killing him slowly.
Still, you have some interesting things to see here, there is action and you get to watch as they just launch a super powered jet as an explosion occurs cuing yet another round of that strange song that is most highly energetic.
Simply put my friends, you have not lived until you have witnessed the cinematic marvel that is Yor: The Hunter From The Future.
The only way to distill the perfect essence that is Yor is with a meager, unworthy list (scorn) of the more jaw dropping aspects of this classic, underrated treatise on the human condition:  1.
Whatever you come away from this list with, just remember that what you have in your head is not a suitable prep for the untethered insanity, the pure unadulterated madness, the sheer brain scrambling head trip that is... YOR, THE HUNTER FROM THE FUTURE!
Most of the reviewers here seem to have overlooked a portion of the movie audience who love this film and keep it alive for one reason only, and that is to see muscle-boy Reb Brown leap, jump, swing and climb his way into our hearts wearing nothing more than a thong under his flimsy, breeze-catching loincloth.
If you haven't seen this movie that is almost as bad as being a virgin.
This is something that is apparent from the word go in this movie.
It will certainly set the alarms going off for pro-lifers, but just about anyone will wonder how it can end like it does, with a twist that is just meant to add one more devilishly wretched twist on top of the baby-plate.
The film is actually a trilogy of separate and unconnected horror tales, each one out to blur the boundaries between horror and art, and to produce something that is more than just to throwaway.
If you're the type that is uneasy hearing the crunching sounds of a women eating an aborted fetus, you might want to skip these and look for Bambi.
"Box" is a complex little mind-bender that is low on graphic violence and shocks, but nevertheless very intense and petrifying.
Three short films that are plenty extreme and if the endings of all three leave us wondering maybe that is good.
A perfect example of that is the scene in which Harry chases a bad guy to the rooftop of a building.
Overall, this is yet another violent, tough-minded and vastly entertaining "Dirty Harry" flick that is a must-see to Callahan-fans and highly recommendable to all action-lovers.
Most importantly, that is not the focus of the filmmakers here, and the fact that Moore is a woman is little more in the overall scheme of things than a footnote in cinematic history; Moore is just another character in the `Dirty Harry' saga, and she's a good one (especially when compared to Harry's partner, Al Quan-- played by Evan C. Kim-- in `The Dead Pool').
A perfect example of that is the scene in which Harry chases a bad guy to the rooftop of a building.
"My Favorite Wife" is easily enjoyable, with a well-written plot that is engaging from the beginning.
The plot can only thicken when Nick finds out that Ellen wasn't alone on that island for 7 years, but she had company in the shape of a very athletic (and very single!)
This reteaming of Grant and Dunne after their success with "The Awful Truth" is pretty funny for the most part, as Grant tries to solve the problem of one wife too many while dealing with jealousy after learning that Dunne had a male companion (Scott) on that island.
This movie I can say is not one of Abbott and Costello's best movies, but it is just a funny film that is a good one that Abbott and Costello managed to make!
Proof of that is a routine where both Abbott and Costello make a monkey out of big dumb leg breaker Mike Mazurki.
The plot primarily focuses on a young guy,Andrew,who is detached and dissilusioned by a life that is far from happy.
Because when the day is done that is why you watch this movie.
You don't have to be a Rob Zombie fan to like this movie, anyone I have ever watched this with has been horrified (to say the least) and that is what most people are looking for when turning to a truly scary movie for entertainment.
And that is something you (or at least I) have to discover with repeated viewingsÂ   The power of this film lies in the fact that the screenplay covers all kind of successful horror premises.
Rob Zombie has created a film that is both a homage and derivative at the same time; most things in the film have been done before, in one shape or another, and the level of gore is a fraction of what was intended, due to its shameful R-rating.
The photography is sensational and helps the emotional story emerge... that is, if you're interested in a story that deals in emotions, which is to say people, which is to say drama.
Fay Bainter plays the mother very well, with her expressive eyes the size of saucers, that is, saucers which are always sliding around all over the place, as if on shipboard in a storm.
Palillo and pal Evan J Klisser(Chuck)having the viewer to endure a "a$$hole" joke that is dead on arrival.
It's rather straightforward, even though the script does throw around many scientific exchanges but counterpointing that is many trashy dialogues.
And that is what the story is about: The gentleness of the greatest of mysteries.
Gladys Cooper is excellent in the lead role; delivering a performance that is both abstract, yet believable at the same time.
Yes, that is what MONPTI will leave in your memory most.
They only charge a buck, but even that is too much for the hacked up 92 minute version of the film they sell.
I am not familiar with Bhen's other roles, but in the final reel she manages to deliver the necessary winning performance that is repressed in the first half of the film.
The easiest way to do that is either by getting the girls naked or disposing of them in the most graphic way possible.
I would have to say I love this film and recommend it to anyone that is a shock/gore fanatic.
Every once in a while you come across a documentary film that is entertaining and dramatic, regardless of whether or not you like the subject matter.
As a teacher, it really made me think about what the purpose of beauty contests are in this day and age... and after having seen the film and the girls involved, i believe that is nothing more than just a beauty pageant.
It is always hard to review a movie that is just so bad.
A fascinating story that is supposedly based upon a true event.
The great Peter Cushing, was doubtlessly one of the most remarkable and brilliant actors the World of Horror has ever seen (and ever will see), and he is once again excellent in the role of the dedicated scientist - a role that is familiar to Cushing, who is probably most famous for his portrayal of Baron Victor Frankenstein in the Hammer films.
Back Roads", a pointless movie which lacks direction and is void thematically, concerns a cross-country journey of discovery that is uninspired and uncovers little.
In addition, like his later CECIL B. DEMENTED, it's an interesting satire that is a way over the top look at America's fascination with celebrity and how we admire and are fascinated with anyone if they are famous--even the vile and horrific.
This is one crazy house wife that you don't want to be a rude kid or adult because she will find you and hunt you down till you are dead.Man this was the best movie that I have seen that is based on true events that is horror that I know and love.This b****Y mom was finally on the louse and insane to kill people that are rude,dressed badly,and anyone that messes with her family,any jokes.And when she went to court was really when she became wild and made each eyewitness into trouble.She is using facts about them and her body to make them crack.And very funny when the judge was flirting with Suzanne Somers when she came in the Court.And lastly,great ending when she kill a woman for wearing   white after Labor Day.And that jury woman taught she was innocent right from the beginning,can you believe this damn woman.And she kills when she was just set free and kill,very stupid thing to do and stupider was the jury setting her free.Now she will continue her work,make a part two Mr.
members of the audience will nod in agreement as that is what you want to ask the makers of this movie from the first minute on.
It's not that the movie is bad, it's that is not good that bothers me.
All in all it was top notch acting all around, and that is seldom to see in an action/thriller.
Similar is every other character; while Rachael Leigh Cook does a rather good job with her Lucy Stanton (a character unfortunately and implausibly called 'Luce' and pronounced 'loose' by her father), she has very little to do but be a victim of her father's obnoxiousness and some sort of bizarre Satanic cult that is only given a raison d'etre in the last twenty minutes.
O.C and Stiggs is what great film making is all about - bringing to life an environment that is high fiction but could truly exist somewhere.
Individual scenes have a strength that is impressive, largely due to the excellent central performances of BURT LANCASTER, EDWARD G. ROBINSON and MADY CHRISTIANS.
This cartoon has some of the poorest animation I've ever seen, and that is another turn-off for this show.
Billy is the lovable doofus always getting into a load of junk that is really stupid, such as eating an endless supply of magical bubble gum and then flactuating huge bubbles, just before belching all of the gum up and into the atmosphere, covering the whole world in gum.
)The thing that changes them is the new English teacher Mr Keating,who Tells them they should "be themselves" and not "act like sheep".Tood and Neil find out that Mr Keating used to be in a club called The Dead Poets society.After hearing about this,Tood and Neil decide to re-open the club to get themselves "Free",this will sadly end with one of them tacking there own life.... View on the film: The screenplay:written by Tom Schulman,while the film has a bit of a thin plot,Schulman makes the film feel like a really great European-type character driven film.The other things that is done very well is the change halfway into the film,where it takes on a very dark turn.While most movies would find it hard to change gears like that,this movie does it really well.
Robin Williams delivers an over the top (but justified) performance as the "cool" teacher that is against the rigid manners of a conservative college for rich and spoiled young men.
Therefore, it should not matter that much that, as it seems, the totalitarian action of the teacher was probably intended as a positive contrast to the strict order that is there at the college.
The film serves up a tacked on and utterly false moment of triumph at the end, but everything that proceeds that is a lesson in failure.
A few of them, are gone now, but that is one of the reasons that I loved this now but not when I saw it then....how strange, but funny.
If the answer to that is zero, like i think it is, than distributors who dare to spend lots of money attaining the rights to obscure films like this will end up taking a bath when no one buys them.
One moment in the film that is simultaneously comic and chilling comes when Rico is on the way back from a murder.
Riding in the back of a truck with the victim in a laundry cart that is nearby, Rico, who is the chief, looks at one of his subordinates, Vince, who is acting very nervously.
or a plot that is strictly 50's US b-movie fodder with sam peckinpah gouts of blood and copious slow-mo's) but it wishes to be both funny and touching and sad at the same time.
In other words, you're prepared for an experience that is out of this world.The best way to describe it is ... a hilarious and romantic candy colored spaghetti western with Asian cowboys and bloody shootouts.
Most of that is monotonous, sappy, melodramatic and out-dated material related to the unrequited love story.
"Dum" has found his father killed by bandits, and he is out for revenge and is almost killed, but he's taken in by rival bandits (who I guess, are cowboys, Thai-style, that is), and he becomes known as the Black Tiger.
Tears of the Black Tiger is a fun film that is destined to become a cult favourite amongst fans of bizarre cinema (and may even improve on repeat viewings, as with most cult movies).
I gave this movie a 2 rating and that is only because of the abortion that followed it deserves a lower mark.
It is a very violent film, but the kind of violence that is truly comic-book, overly-red blood (think cheap hammer horror), taken to a level of exaggeration which rather than making you gag, just makes you wince and laugh.
And that is the point.
Some people have said that is just terrible, but it is knowingly terrible.
Of course it's dated, but that is no point against an old film.
to mirror the arm's length from the fullness of engagement in life that is the nature of existence for her characters until varying quiet epiphanies open their paths to new alternative ways of perceiving.
In a scene that is somewhere halfway (actually I bet it's precisely halfway) you get the clue you need: there's no beginning and no end in this movie, so don't bother yourself looking for it.
Now that is a film that tries to show the modern world of relationships and how many people just do not get what they want, due to mean folks around, lack of communication and trust or just unfitting circumstances.
The real problem with this film is that is is advertising to be what it is obviously not - a spy thriller or war picture or science fiction film even.
It is a simple little comedy that is cheaply made and has some good scenes working with the materials at hand.
Director Scott turns in an average looking film that isn't much fun to watch.
Occasionally, there's a film that passes by that is decent enough to be watchable and those films get my praise for their results on such a low budget.
We hear a gunshot that is so quiet it's like a dull thump, and then the scorpion just simply whips away from sight, so quickly it almost just disappears.
The premise of the story is sound enough, and that is what actually attracted me enough to rent this movie.
Unfortunately, that is the only redeeming quality in this movie.
Obviously a cheep movie that is trying to make some money from the popularity of Peter Jackson's King Kong.
Bruce Boxleitner is cast perfectly, in that is he a bad guy or good guy role.
You know, they should make a DVD boxset consisting of Jaws 2, Jaws 4 and - Jesus - this crap that is Jaws 3.
A movie that is somewhat underrated and unintentionally overlooked in "favourite westerns" discussions ESCAPE FROM FORT BRAVO is nevertheless an excellent and true classic western!
The climactic tightrope walk is a bit of a letdown next to the earlier, funnier bits (like the opening funhouse chase), but that is a small detraction.
There is a scene, lasting only a few minutes, in which Chaplin imitates a mechanical man that is about as funny as anything he's done.
It's just the entire assemblage of skits and moments, little things that might seem silly to talk about- like Chaplin locked in a lion's cage or trying to 'learn' a barber trick- and how it unfolds with a precision and finesse (yes, finesse) that is just short of genius, if not that.
In fact, the movie is devoid of any action at all that isn't not only predictable, but juvenile.
He has a passion for the past, a love for his mate, and a sincerity that is classic.
It's naturally quite fitting for a tale that is later marketed as one of tragic romance and a representation of the level of cruelty which humanity is capable of.
There is also a lot of nudity in the series that is so unnecessary and misused that it only adds to the disaster factor.
This personality is a stark contrast to the cold violent killer that is Lucy.
And if you are a fan of great anime with great background music that is totally contradictory yet totally appropriate to the series, then you have your helping in "more than you can eat" servings.
The only criticism I can offer is a kind that is more compliment that critical; this anime is too short.
all the women didn't do bad at all but maybe that is because all together there may have been about five lines of dialogue written for all the females in this film combined.
Of the actual movie that is.
Arguably, the best element about the entirely pitiable project is the enticing title, and then that is also for about 99% inaccurate.
The result is a tedious film that is nowhere near as much fun as its title suggests.
There is a fight between two reptile Dinosaur type beasties that is straight out of the Chewits ad of the 80's with the monster eating the leaning tower of Piza, the Taj Mahal and the Empire State Building.
This is a masterpiece by John Sullivan who went on to write the brilliant Only Fools and Horses, only one sitcom is better than this and that is Dads Army.
But there's also a daring here that is totally unshakable too, and from a point of view of cinematography it actually goes on par (if not occasionally seems to top) what Kubrick did in 2001 or what Lynch could've done in Dune, which is that a filmmaker uses places and objects that are of this world, but then taking the audience to a place that is also assuredly not so.
As a babysitter, a child-care provider, an aunt, and a mom I have seen enough of the genre to really appreciate the freshness that is offered by the High School Musical franchise.
This movie is so much better than other tween/kid crap that is on TV.
Families want to see good entertainment that is in good taste.
Every song has its own sound and feel that is much more unique than the first one.
My only problem is that there isn't a song that is as amazing and climatic as Breaking Free.
I could care less how cute an actor is that does not excuse the horrible monstrous atrocity that is High School Musical!
Basically the only thing that is better in this film from the original is the music.
The story never loses focus, is wildly romantic and is the first political film that is so gorgeous to look at--it's painted in lush, primary colors that made my jaw drop open with delight.
I recommend Tim Robbin's movie Bob Roberts if you'd like a political satire that is actually funny and not just insulting.
Warren Beatty probably gives the best experience of his career.Halle Berry has only a supporting role in reality BUT she does have a political oriented speech that is one of the most outstanding speech ever given on the big screen, when it comes to class oriented views.
The structure only goes uphill from there, and that is hard to do.
Along with some very dramatic and meaningful moments found in "Bulworth," also contained is dialogue that is smart, witty, and at times hilarious.
I think some people have a problem with the fact that he is...well, more or less insane, but that is possibly the most important thing about the character.
My criteria for a true bad movie is one that is either just plain boring or just plain stupid.
Much of the stock footage that isn't sea lions is native women of the South Pacific.
Perfect, that is, until Bickford starts running around with a money-hungry tramp who urges him to dump his long-suffering wife--leading to a super-melodramatic conclusion in the courtroom.
In a courtroom scene that is just too melodramatic to be true, her ultimate niceness convinces the evil Bickford to admit it is all a frame-up and he is taken away to prison.
The build-up in the movie, especially the sharp dialogue that is given to the aforementioned William, makes the movie feel even shorter than its hour-plus running time.
Yes Ms Hayek does seem to get a lot of top and bottom shots, I wonder why that is?
Harrelson then catches up to them because a cruise ship is in port that is displaying one of the world's largest diamonds.
From here, Burdett and Cirillo retire to the utopia that is the Caribbean.
Selma Hayek exists in this film to merely wear a bikini and look attractive, that is it.
Therefore the picture was very fine and clear but all that is not enough to get an average rating.
This film has a very loose plot that isn't very gripping, and the actual heist scene is very childish and simple.
Instead of bringing a new twist to his character, he resorted to weird sex humor, skimpy bully humor, and that ever-popular drunken humor while fishing that is sure to make that senile woman in the front burst out with laughter.
He was lucky to get the genius of Dante Spinetti's cinematography to create a movie that is entertaining with great locations.
After the Sunset sees Pierce Brosnan play an ex-jewel thief in a simple "will the old pro come out of retirement for one last job" movie that is far more entertaining than its unoriginal premise sounds.
Shooting the entire scene from the exterior emphasizes Vogel's aloneness against the malevolent power that is working against him.
Many conflicts are resolved and seemingly there is potential for living happily ever after, at least that is, until Return To Peyton Place...
Lana Turner seems to have one mode in this film; that is, to walk around like a frigid bitter ice queen delivering harsh lines at everyone.
It does have one big narrative problem, and that is that its climax is a trial.
...that is, if you haven't seen "Top Gun", "Die Hard" or any other movies with explosions, planes, Louis Gossett Jr., etc... etc....
This is an excellent documentary and it puts inmates in a light that is not usually shown in the media.
This is a little gem of a thriller that is all too hard to find anymore.
The hate, the love, the bad and the good, the violence of the streets and the violence of politics, racism and a country that is beging its history.
Much like his endlessly-feuding, barbaric, mid-19th century New Yorkers, the man seems to have worn his welcome in history, and what a sad, sad realization that is.
The message that is conveyed, although not an entirely wholesome one, is an important one to learn and, if considered, is very relevant to our time.
It is more of a "family" troma flick if that is possible.
Briget Fonda and Matthew Broderick play the Lightbodies, a pair that is separated at their arrival and who encounter satisfaction in more ways than one, as they discover their sexuality.
But viewers who are interested in a story will be more than rewarded with a complex drama about a group of humans off in search of a brave new world to populate, with an ending sequence that is perhaps the most provocative element of the entire film -- and would later find form again in Mario Bava's PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES, albeit in a different manner.
Most huff that "it's got this lame and OBVIOUS ending" - And, sadly, they are referring to an ending that is neither lame nor was "obvious" -- for it was never meant to be by the filmmakers!
Its weakest point is the poor lighting, but that is more a reflection of the budget than the story itself.
This is a film full of beautiful color cinematography (it earned a deserved Oscar nom in this category) that is also extremely accomplished in the difficult tracking shots that put us right IN the races.
This is a radiant film that is perfect for adolescents to watch, especially those in love with horses and racing.
Not quite as good as 'Best In Show' but much better than 'A Mighty Wind' this film is the first he's done that is a straight story instead of a documentary style although he has cleverly woven elements of that in to this film through the actors doing interviews for various television shows and specials.
Catherine O'Hara is funny in a whole new way, with at least one scene that is quite poignant and unforgettable, at least to struggling artists.
But that is not to say any of the cast's performances were not noteworthy.
The satire seemed to me to be to be quite precise - particularly in its analysis of the average actor's life - which is a lot more like "For Your Consideration" or Ricky Gervais's brilliant "The Extras" than anything you're likely to see on Entertainment Tonight that is for sure.
More like "A Mighty Wind" with its dramatic undercurrents, this one is not as laugh-out-loud as "Waiting for Guffman" and "Best in Show", but it shows a continuing maturation in Guest's film-making technique that is most welcome.
We feel at first as if he may be slow, and perhaps to some extent he is, but in a way that is lost in emotionally charged internalized delusions, a return to the primordial dilemma.
a movie that is not focusing on a special mission or on action but rather on people, what implies their job, on their daily life...even if they are spies.
And that is all there.
It is so bad, I don't know if I'll be able to watch "Terms Of Endearment" again, and that is one of my all time favorite movies.
A movie filled with emotions and passion that is picturing the story of Aurora Greenway and her family and friend circle.
It is that homoristic and ironic spirit of James L. Brooks that is missing...
Mackenzie Astin plays Teddy and is really the only child that is slightly happy and normal of the three.
By the way, director Milestone and Louis Walheim would team up just a few years later for another WWI picture, the great ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT--a film that is definitely NOT a comedy.
This was perhaps a miscalculation, because they are being followed by the Argentine police, that is working with local authorities in apprehending all the criminals.
She's responsible for singing all of the songs on the soundtrack and by singing I mean tone deaf caterwauling that is so annoying that I attempted to drive pencils into my ear canals.
It's not a horror movie and there are only two brief scenes that could conceivably land it in the genre; the first is a somewhat botched gang rape around a campfire and the other is the "revenge" scene with two guys fighting with hatchets and knives that is cut short before any blood could be spilled when one of the characters decides to do the "sensible" thing...
Well, that's what I thought as well, but that is the premise.
I doubt that is the original title, as it appears on the screen via a bad video effect, and appears to be blocking out the original title by being placed on a large green rectangle (probably Sunburst).
I notice that Best Actress went to Helen Mirren - who's also deserved an Oscar for years - for playing a queen, and Best Actor went to Forest Whitaker for playing a king (the last one of Scotland, that is).
This is a typical Academy Award show that is hosted by Ellen DeGenerous.
There is one scene that is especially riveting.
It is also much better than most of the trash that is being produced for TV and movie theaters today.
A surreal comedy that is also poignant and cruel.
It features excellent underwater photography (with special proccesses created for the film) and a hand-to-hand duel at the film end in a river that is memorable.
With most horrors you can easily predict who is going to survive, unfortunately that is also the case here, for there is such a great group of people that one might find themselves hoping that they all survive.
Obviously made on a low-budget, it certainly shows, but that is nearly a given with these sorts of films.
Now, on to the character of the Ice Queen, the only character that is not flat out cheesy, dumb or annoying.
She's not pure evil, she's just a creature put into an unfamiliar environment that is panic stricken, kinda the same thing as Cloverfield probably was.
If you don't know what the movie's about, well it's about a doctor and his archaeological team finding the find of the century, a frozen woman from the ice age who has genetic structure solely made out of liquid that is meant to be kept below 30 degrees.
The movie includes the origin of the mysterious girl that is Sadako.
Cann and Midler work so well against and with each other, underlined by George Segal in a role that is actually substantial for him.
Good sets and use of the everglades.Cooper is once again the ipitome of what a hero should be ,underplaying ,but shows what a superb cinema actor he was by seemingly doing very little but conveying through facial and body language all that is necessary.
Every so often a film comes along that is misunderstood by critics and ignored by the public, but is subsequently rediscovered and reappraised.
I have to admit this is the best thing I have seen Ms. Spelling do, and that is stretching it a bit.
It was one of those types of movies that is completely predictable, and actually manages to be somewhat insulting to those of us that don't pride ourselves on our religious beliefs.
Without using anything crass, it gives you a message that is gritty and real.
I read that this will be Mr. Garner's last film, I do hope that such is not the case, however if it is, then he has gone out on a high note that is a fine cap to his career.
Yes, the plot is predictable, and yes, the tenor of the piece borders on soap opera at times, but the end result is an examination of life that is told with enough fine humor and realistic dialog that it works.
And, yes, that is Jean Rogers as the reporter, on a break from Ming the Merciless and his serial effort at conquering the universe and Flash Gordon all in the same breath.
Whistling in Brooklyn is a fast paced comedy that is nice and personal for me and for the aging fans of the former Brooklyn Dodgers.
There may be a few clinkers here and there, such as Wally's jibe,"You'll live the life of Riley...that is, if Riley don't come home," a joke that was already stale in 1943.
Except here the farm boy is a former porn star now reduced to being a fluffer (if you don't know what that is, put your player on 'pause' now and rent the film THE FLUFFER), the 'chicken' is actually not poultry but the human variety, and the 'head' is...well, I think you get the idea.
Taxidermia is a stellar effort that is definitely worth your money.
The world has not seen enough of the brilliance that is GyÃ¶rgy PÃ¡lfi.
Anyway the movie is different but good with a great acting of Yukie Nakama that play sakoma a perfect way, i mean the way she moves is like ring 1 and 2, gratz for that, she probably needed to train to walk like that all the time :) Only little thing that is a bit dissapointing in this movie is that we would perhaps would have loved to be in a bit more different places, most of the movie is in 1 very same place and start to look more like a theater then really a movie, it gets very good again once they get out of there, but until then the movie had some boring parts, otherwise great movie if you don't see it the same way as Ringu 1 and 2.
An event takes place half way through that is the pay-off to all this and Sue and Hong join forces against the rest of the bad guys(more than a hint of John Woo's The Killer) resulting in some really stunning stunts and wire-work.
Effects used are mediocre at best but that doesn't harm the film too much - it is mostly the comedy value that is to be appreciated.
It's a dance that is similar to the continental African ethnic expression of their connection to Nature, but Rize is more angry and rightly so.
I am not the biggest fan of hip-hop, rap, r&b, etc., but I decided to check out this documentary because I recently moved to LA and I appreciate seeing people who take difficult life situations and turn them into something positive, and that is exactly what happens in this movie.
The best example of the boring game play is a situation in which ash (you) has to fight against the invisible evil that has followed him into the hospital and that is now throwing chairs, tables and doors on him.
It is then that the film truly kicks into full stride, temporarily forgetting any notions of romance and embarking on a frenetic cross-country excursion that is, without a doubt, one of the most exhilarating sequences of the silent era.
Another aspect of this film that is worthy of comment is that, when the woman who left her husband first appeared, she was wearing a pair of tights with the pattern of the American flag.
This is a movie that is filled with what you'd expect to see from the Marx Brothers!
If you are really a huge fan of the Marx Brothers and want to see a movie that is really a huge slap-happy time, then this is a movie that I would very recommend that you see!
Like I just said, this is not the best movie that the Marx Brothers ever made, their best film is Duck Soup, but this is a movie that is going to get you laughing your head off at, this movie has very big laughs, it is a must see for all fans of the Marx Brothers!
In terms of meatiness, that's far more of a plot than I usually relay, but all of that is presented in the first 10 - 15 minutes of the film.
Tony Martin has a song early on in the film that's okay, but doesn't exactly fit the tone of the film, and later, he does another "big musical production number", called "The Tenement Symphony", that is bizarre, to say the least, but not particularly funny.
Instead, it's a strange mish-mash of styles that is strongly derivative (in a negative way) of George Gershwin.
Jake won't eat anything that is round.
The sheer diversity that is showcased in this film is enough to overpower three typical action films put together.
To summarize: this is an highly original, comical (in the black humor sense), bizarre movie that is a must for those who are tired of 'normal' ones.
Each brings with them a unique screen presence that is both sexy and endearing.
If you are looking for an intelligent action drama, you are probably better served skipping "So Close", however if you want a fun action drama that is so much more better than "Charlie's Angels", then "So Close" is something for you.
Engaging story, complex but likable characters, thought provoking themes about war, and amazing animation that is years ahead of its time.
The characters are alright, better than characters in DragonBall Z (but that isn't saying to much), but the writers obviously tried to make the characters appear deeper than they actually are by having them say and do things that really don't make a whole lot of sense (they did this much more in the show, the movie wasn't nearly as bad on this subject).
I highly recommend this film that is funny but never lightheaded, melancholic but never pretentious, humble but never loses its love for its characters with their imperfections and secrets.
but i think that is kind of the point..... the movie is not about weddings, its about the relationships between people.
However, like the Tarantino hit "Kill Bill", it's not the plot that is the major strength of the show, it is the presentation.
To be honest that is the only reason I agreed to accompany my Girlfriend to the movies to see it.
The story here, which revolves around two best gal-pals Liv (Kate Hudson) and Emma (Anne Hathaway) as they try to cope with their simultaneous weddings, is one that is likely to get a few chuckles from females, but less so with their male counterparts.
It could have been enough if it had been worked out some better, but quite sadly this comedy fails to be funny and that is IMO one of the prime requisites of a comedy - making the audience laugh out loud a good number of times and keep them amused until after the ending credits.
It all boils down to a typically pointless ending and overall, this is one of the few films that is bettered by the lamentable 'Demons 2'!
Of course different doesn't also mean better but in this particular case I didn't mind some of these changes, since the movie obviously still worked out and can be regarded as one that is on par with most of the other Columbo movies and even slightly better than just the average ones.
Consequently there's a great deal of gentle humor here, but it never gets campy, and doesn't get in the way of a tight little mystery that is doomed to end badly for everyone - the detectives succeed in the end only because they live to be able to tell the tale (and are smart enough to know not to waste their breath telling it).
The main problem with the movie is that if you are a true football fan you know that many of stunts pulled off in the movie could never be pulled off in real life and that is where the movie looses a lot of its credibility.
In hindsight I think it has enough intriguing elements, also story-wise, to warrant an 8 rating, and that is what I have now revised my rating to.)
Becker did not look out of his depth in the company of the likes of Zidane, Roberto Carlos and David Beckham -- as long as he did not have the ball, that is.
Solid sequel that is recommended to all fans of the original!
And that is its strength: you never know if the Item is kidding or not.
Instead you get a poorly lit video shoot, a handful of actors who I felt sorry for (they're taking this very seriously and some have promise) slightly above student film quality production values, and a creature that is nothing more than a rubber hand puppet.
When I saw the movie picture I thought it was something like Alien or maybe like Jurassic Park, but I found a movie that is completely dissapointing, with an high level of violence/gore unnecesary, a stupid end, a creature that is ridiculous, etc, etc.
By the time these dopes are at the ringleader's girlfriend's apartment, eating Chinese food and blowing away transvestites for no real reason, 'The Item'--a button-eyed, phallic-looking psychic creature that is disturbingly comic--lulls each character (and the viewer) into a murderous daze.
I've seen so many movies and when somebody who is a movie buff like me throws out the term "the worst movie i've ever seen", that is a comment to be taken seriously.
There is only one way to get anything remotely resembling payback on your rental investment, not to mention the 90 minutes of your life that it will end up wasting, and that is to watch it with some friends where you can mock the thing to scorn.
Usually the only thing that approaches a dearth in fatality like that is dermatology.
In short if you like your comedy with some actual comedy that isn't covered in cheese and then rolled inside a ball of cheese and dropped into a 1 million gallon vat of cheese then don't watch this as its cheesy.
In this American remake, all that is gone.
Beacouse that is going to happen!
I'm a big fan of cult cinema, and almost all the sub-genres have some decent films among them - that is, except Nazisploitation.
A dark love affair ensues, and nonetheless it is in some ways a truer depiction of love than the one that is usually given by the average film, where everything is clean and white.
So, if that is enough of a recommendation for you then go for it.
Unlike the extremely camp exercise in bad taste that is 'Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS' , Gestapo's Last Orgy is a more unflinching look at the atrocities committed in a Nazi concentration camp, shot in a quasi-serious style.
In my opinion, all Nazisploitation movies are treading on dodgy ground and if you're going to use such a touchy subject to make a film that is designed to titillate and disgust, then you might as well go the whole hog.
It's not so much that the film is hopelessly confused and illogical; even really good ones, like Groundhog, don't hold up (logically, that is) under close scrutiny, and virtually none of Hitchkock's greats make real sense.
Minority Report, I would say, is one of the best science fiction films to be released over the past twenty-five years, and that is certainly no small feat given some of the competing films released over that time-span.
Then another appeared, essentially genetic this time and some still believe that the DNA of any individual contains its destiny that is absolutely inescapable.
First the three seers don't always agree and there might be a minority report from one of them that is over-ruled by the two others and not communicated to the precrime police.
Son of Dracula is different from the standard Horror flicks of the 40's and that is why it works and continues to stand out 64 years later.
(Apart from the precognition, that is.)
The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder.
The blueish tint given to the film also gives us a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the time we live in, another trait of a Dick story.
This is a universal equation that is never escaped, but it does not mean that any movie that involves time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot holes.
The action in the film comes from the possibility that the whole prediction of Anderton's murder might be what is called a `minority report,' where the pre-cogs disagree on something that is going to happen.
that is way good.
This has got to be one of the lowest budget films ever produced in Britain , and considering it`s a British film that is indeed saying a lot .
The suave George Sanders plays the evil man that is trying to frame Cheryl by any means.
The reviews on this thread keep referring to Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW, which certainly is the best known version of this plot, except for one element that is not in that film until very late.
But that is about ten minutes before the end of the film.
Accept Islam and everything that is required of a Muslim (you know, fun stuff like, no pork, no alcohol, paying zakat, praying five times a day, oh yeah...and circumcision).
well yes, that is the point, it is about the Christian crusades, if it was about the side of the muslims it would have been called "jihad" or something.
What is the difference between a movie that is "okay" and a movie that stays with you long after you have seen it?
In the role of "The Man with the Dog," (a different person than "The Man") Stephen Angus creates an utterly mysterious character with an effortlessness that is in such contrast to the tempest he creates in his scene partner, (the besieged Tim Burke,) that it is impossible to look away from his face.
In this dream the man finds his own dream fulfilled, that is, his old life is gone, and now he will pursue his dream, perhaps his passion, for acting.
He has to nurture the unconditional love that is now in his life ON A DAILY BASIS; he will be focused, and his priorities appear to have been totally rearranged (he sacrificed his old self for atonement and redemption of the new).
The Final Verdict: A very solid and entertaining entry that is far better than it's status and keeps it far from boring.
Moreover, things go wrong at her residence, where she works as a servant or nurse to a married woman who falsely accuses her of involvement with her husband, an accusation that is echoed by the returning daughter.
Joan Crawford, Van Heflin, Raymond Massey and Geraldine Brooks give outstanding performances in a movie that is well ahead of its time.
Bernhardt shot a stylish, dark movie that is technically of the highest quality.
With the innocence of her young character Brooks brings some specks of light in this basically dark movie that is badly needed.
Extras include Drew Casper's audio commentary that is spooky in its own right, as well as a featurette proclaiming "Possessed" as the quintessential film noir Â the latter is a bone of contention for this reviewer.
While Van Heflin gives an applaudably callous performance as the insensitive focus of obsession, partially because I cannot understand why such an incredibly ugly man like him so often plays roles of confidently unavailable loners after whom beautiful women obsess, Joan Crawford gives one of those tremendous performances that is almost like a throwback to ancient Greek theater when the protagonist was such an abundant function of the story to the extent that he had to portray every other character and even sometimes the props as well.
A young Geraldine Brooks makes a good impression as Carol the girl that is deprived of her mother at an early age.
Once again I think this movie was just a lot of fun and that is what it's all about.
As a result, it's a very good romantic-comedy that is worth a look.
Directed by Rene Clair who also made "Le Million", which I reviewed, and "A Nous La Liberte," (some say that is his masterpiece, but I have yet to see, but will) this is yet another example of Dietrich at her sexiest, and all Dietrich fans and film lovers should buy the Marlene Dietrich DVD collection with this on it and sit back and see one of the greatest screen icons ever!
That is not something that is developed or created...it just is.
Maybe it is the good samaritan in me that is compelling me to warn others about this movie.
And that is a very innovative idea.
Look for the painfully obvious special effects mortar cannon that is visible in the street during a chase scene.
I was laughing in many of the scenes.I know that many people didn't love this movie and it didn't do very well at the box office and that is considered one of the worst movies of all time but I really enjoyed it anyway despite what people thought of it and that it was a box office bomb.It wasn't the best comedy movie of all time but it was a really good movie.Also not the best Mike Myers movie of all time but it was one of his good ones.I really liked the music and characters and plot 9/10 is my rating If you love Mike Myers then you have got to see this movie.
Also, Verne Troyer has quite the clever line -- in the credits, that is.
I can say that it is excellent, it is a very funny Three Stooges film that is very filled with hysterical moments and everything that is typical from the Three Stooges!
Out of all of the Three Stooges shorts that I have watched and loved in my life, I can say that though there are some shorts that I like better than others, I can not say that I have seen one Three Stooges short that I have hated, I love all of the ones that I have seen, and I believe that is a very good thing that I have!
Well, in an old film, particularly a Three Stooges short that is 68 years old, you're going to get a lot of strange name-calling.
The fact that it is based on short story by Dashiell Hammett puts in a class above the rest with a story-line that is frighteningly plausible.
A great sketch show that is very popular amongst young children.
I also fancy Ann (played by David), but that is manly because she's so funny.
That said, I, for one, thought Chaney was at the peak of his form as the "retard" Lenny, and, whilst it is more than understandable that some found his performance "over the top," that is purely a matter of subjective reaction.
Matt Lucas and David Walliams have created a world (and a series) that is silly, bawdy, brutal, clever, satiric, surreal, lewd and funny.
Yet thanks to a style that is warm, honest, rich and--especially--gentle, a story full of quite awful happenings is told in such a way that whatever director/co-writer Jiang Xiao offers us, including some pretty heavy coincidence, we gratefully accept because all of it works beautifully toward her goal of celebrating film, family and friendship.
I feel that is what they did on this movie.
It's just a really cheap idea, not even a new one, splattered across way too much time and resulting in a ridiculous, totally made-up ending that is impossible to believe if you got some sort of a brain...
Plus Ace goes eyeball to eyeball with a man-eating shark, and his investigation of the Miami Dolphins team simply woos everyone as the persistent search for the missing mascot continues with a clue that is linked to a missing AFC Championship Ring from 1984.
It's hard out there for pet detectives, since it's a field that nobody takes too seriously, except Ace, that is.
This is not the type of movie that is likely to win any awards, but you will remember the hilarious dialogue and Jim Carrey's immediately recognizable rubber-faced antics in this film that served as a spring board to his career, which later brought us many more excellent movies.
However, there's an angle here that the emotion of the movie's last few minutes overpowers, and that is whether George's act of mercy does in fact represent the wisest or best decision, all things considered.
My father went to his grave hating the Japanese and that is hardly surprising.
sometimes we get caught thinking 'why would he do that' when a character commits a particularly selfless act, and I think that is a big part of the writer's intent.
I like films that are about something that is important, at least to me, and not just pure entertainment.
Where he isnt a ghost or goblin,not that is not bad.
I'll state again that is movie is FASCIST.
The fact that this movie blatantly steals scenes from other, better movies is not what makes it so bad (but now that I think of it, stealing is one of the crimes that is punishable by death according to the Saints.
Now it is easy to understand if you kill innocent people, that is wrong, but what about going to a strip club?
Quite frankly, a movie that is this sharply written, acted, and directed is a true rarity these days.
It also has a fairly original idea that is utilized in nearly every action scene in the movie, and that should be used more often in action films; first you see the aftermath, the crime-scene, the police investigating, counting bodies, etc.
The plot of the movie is about a journalist who invent a story about the life of a fictitious pimp called Tyron that is published in the magazine where he writes.
Add to this cinematography that is both artistically and technically outstanding and you have a film that truly deserves the term Classic.
We are usually treated to a Jesus that is somewhat detached or "royal" in his bearing (think Jeffrey Hunter in "King of Kings").
The joy that is evident in your smile told me more about Jesus Christ than anything else I have ever read or seen.
...There is only one reason to watch this movie - or rather, fast forward through it - and that is to see a large Noah's Arc roll off the side of a cliff and smash into loads of little pieces.
there is not a single thing about this movie that is believable.
It's not a fatal problem; however, as Cauldron of Death is an entertaining and gritty little thriller that is well worth seeing if you can find it!
"Ricco" is an enjoyably dark mix of sex and brutality that is sure to titillate and entertain fans of exploitation.
I've no idea what the title is alluding to, but to surmise the film; it's an unflinching depiction of murder and rape that is all the more shocking because of the fact that most of the film is really quite realistic.
The only place the film is lacking is on the actual 'money shots' - we don't get to see the protagonist stab his victims in the crotch, and the reason for that is down to the Japanese penal code - which states that no full frontal nudity can be shown in films.
For anyone who's into video games, there is some great music in this that is very similar to a game called Katamari Damacy.
BOKO KIRISAKI JACK is his crowning achievement, a film that is violent, erotic, funny, perceptive and always entertaining.
Of course I will never give the ending away, but needless to say this is a very well-made film that is often more serious than meets the eye.
Philip Carey passes as sort of a poor man's Gary Merrill (that is to say, absolutely penniless), while Harry Townes, an even more faceless actor, makes up the roster.
But with "Cracking Up", he finds himself stuck with a movie that is so loud, so shrill and so in-your-face that laughing at it is not an option.
"My Favorite Wife" is easily enjoyable, with a well-written plot that is engaging from the beginning.
The plot can only thicken when Nick finds out that Ellen wasn't alone on that island for 7 years, but she had company in the shape of a very athletic (and very single!)
This reteaming of Grant and Dunne after their success with "The Awful Truth" is pretty funny for the most part, as Grant tries to solve the problem of one wife too many while dealing with jealousy after learning that Dunne had a male companion (Scott) on that island.
Following that is a period of awful fight scenes, terrible dialogue, and stereotypes.
However in Metropolitan, she shines in her own gentle, ladylike way.Lawrence Tibbett the great operatic baritone has some glorious moments and some great arias and songs.Miss Bruce is his love interest and if that is her singing ,which I doubt; she had a lovely voice as well.
1st watched 12/1/1997 - (Dir-Robert M. Young): Well put-together story of the cost that is paid for sin, more specifically adultery.
I should tell you that this Crawford's presence in this movie is very strong, but perhaps that is not even news for all those who have seen GRAND HOTEL, in which she had the same strong presence even alongside Greta Garbo, who is known to have such centralizing effects herself.
The "town and country" set of this film feels both ostentatiously grand and a little too cramped and small, and that is a good way of describing the whole thing.
The problem is the Inauguration was always held on March the 4th, that is until they changed the law in 1933, when the Inauguration was changed to be on January the 20th, so that there could be a quicker change of office.
But now he has a new mission in his life(sent by God), that is to help his people (The Jews) to not be slaves anymore and go to the Promise Land.
Some will object to the film not pandering to Clancy's right-wing political points of view or his gung-ho pro-military stance, but that isn't necessarily what this movie is about.
The only thing in the entire film I found difficult was the pronunciation of Aaron's name- but that is obviously minor, it just took me a while to 'get' if that makes sense.
Beneath Still Waters starts in 'Northern Spain 1965' as two young boys Teo & Luis trespass in a town that is being flooded by the creation of a dam, they run wild throughout it's streets but hear screaming coming from the local Church, upon investigation they find several people in the basement chained up including the evil dabbler in black magic Mordecai Salas (Patrick Gordon) whom Teo unwisely sets free as Teo is killed by Salas but Luis runs off... Jump forward '40 Years Later' & photojournalist Dan Quarry (Michael McKell) wants to do a story on the now completely submerged town & the upcoming celebrations by the town that was built nearby in place of it, however the preparations for the celebrations aren't going too well as a boy named Antonio drowns in the lake created by the dam.
In 1965, the story starts, two little boys explore a deserted town that is to be flooded.
Featuring a European cast who, with the exception of a couple of Brits, struggle with the English dialogue, Beneath Still Waters is a badly scripted, poorly acted and dreary piece of nonsense that is enlivened occasionally by some fairly decent gore and loads of nudity.
The police divers, with the support of the outsider photo journalist Dan Quarry (Michael McKell) that is filming the submerged Marienbad to write a matter about the town, try unsuccessfully to find the body.
next thing, the heroes swap goggles for sunglasses and throw flares... so they outsmart the gangsters, but, perhaps more importantly, they also LOOK way, way cooler - and that is the whole point!
This Hong Kong working of the plot from "Sneakers" is one that is definitely worth tracking down.
Sometimes its disgusting, and at the end when actual body parts get in the mix of things (including, not too undeservedly, a penis and testicles, which actually are the dividing line that isn't crossed) it's downright crude, but it's downright raunchy and crazy and quintessentially Svankmajer.
Like all teen movies it has a strong message that is spelled out for everyone.
George C. Scott (Patton) plays Angus' grandfather that is always falling asleep and he plays the role of dad to Angus giving him advice.
He shows no compassion to whoever he feels is not "normal", that is, whoever does not follow his concepts of physical and social beauty.
It's filled with superb imagery, good special effects, effective make-up and lots of atmosphere that is impressively imposing.
The movie does have it silly moments, especially towards the ending and the characters aren't as good as in the original but still "Ringu 2" is a great scary horror movie that is well constructed and from a technical point of view is even better than the original.
Harriet Craig was a character, and that is all.
What follows is a rather dull boat trip through the bayou punctuated by silly dialog (featuring lots of "cat fighting", frequent use of words such as "dame", "broad" and "loot" as well as frequent whining by Connor's girlfriend) and stock footage that is rather randomly inserted.
Occasionally, a movie comes along that is a delight from the beginning to end.
It apparently did not gross that much money, and that is a mystery to me.
A Navy pilot, Tuck Pendelton, (Dennis Quaid) has been chosen for a secret experiment to operate a pod-like craft that is miniturized smaller than a grain of salt to be injected into a laboratory rabbit.
After stealing a microchip that is required for the process, one of the scientists injects the pod into the hypochondriac Safeway employee, Jack Putter.
James Duval gives a performance that is positively incandescent; it is an amazing achievement.
There are some action, and gunfights, and that is what makes the movie watchable.
Now let me get to the part that is probably controversial.
And trust me that is about all there is to the plot, except one of them is a undercover policewoman and they come across a couple going to examine oil wells or something.
True, the movie is pretty short on real plot, and you can tell that some scenes were filmed in a swimming pool, but otherwise it's a real pleasure; guilty pleasure, that is.
initially I was struck by just how beautiful the whole thing looked and I like the idea that a kid can be a main character and not make the show seem fruity or childish like so many "made for America anime" some of that is o.k.
The joke is that Milt loves a woman that isn't his wife (ba-dum-bum!
Carlin continues to be the master observer of all that is good and evil and twisted in the world.
Extremely few comedians are successful, even fewer for more than a year or two and the majority of those few that are still working the large venues, who prove themselves to be other than just some flash-in-the-pan dressed up in an ill-fitting suit of success by an aggressive publicity team and a gullible, entertainment starved audience; usually build their careers on one or two jokes that they've turned into their shtick: they have a quirky personality that is charming or, at least, familiar.
It is an honor to speak about the documentary of this life story that is bigger than life.
It is an honor to speak about the documentary of this life story that is bigger than life.
This is set in England during World War II and they are on a boat that is about to dock.
It is as good here as it is in The Grapes of Wrath, My Darling Clementine, and The Searchers, that is, it is one of his very best films, if not THE best.
This film is virtually plot free but of course that isn't important.
All those shows had a certain stylized "look" that is very identifiable and different from today.
An unexpected murder caused by Q-tips occurs near the film's conclusion, and that is a good representation of some of the typically left-of-centre elements Rhys Jones puts out there.
This isn't a film that tries to take on the universal disease that is autism but is a quiet and beautiful film which gives hope to those who watch it as we see a content family that deals with having two sons of similar age.
This true to life film is a inside glimpse into a family that is, at its core, held together by the mother.
Thomas develops a strained relationship with a girl that is nice to him.
You tend to accept anything that is thrown in an attractively haphazard fashion on screen; you drink in all their imperfections and are hooked for more.
Anderson employs India thankfully not as if he and his audience are tourists, but as a surrounding that is extremely palpable, a testament to the true power of cinema without the vain aide of Blu-Ray and Hi-Def revolutionizing, as we can practically smell India and dread the ferocious sun and the feeling of sweat.
Finally, there's the director, Wes Anderson, who must be castigated not only for his self-indulgence but for having a sense of humor that is thoroughly juvenile in tone and scope.
The emotional, yet blissful experience that is The Darjeeling Limited is Wes Anderson's best film thus far, defeating Rushmore for that top spot.
Their cook has just left the family, when Irwin's snoopy and hypocrite cousin Archibald Soper (Louis Jouvet) that is in campaign against the police stories of Felix Chapel invites himself to have dinner in Irwin's house.
Sadako then ends up with the leading role in the play but when the meddling reporter slips a tape in that isn't meant to be part of the play, it changes everything and Sadako's telekinetic powers are unleashed on the unsuspecting audience and cast, but stopped just short of harm to anyone....except, herself.
Director James Toback does try to make the movie visually interesting, but its excesses result in overstimulation that is hyperactive and annoying.
I would have vote 1 out of 10 but i voted 2 because of this involuntary comedy factor that is present.
The story was rather dull and pointless and also full of clichÃ©s - bad one's that is.
Compared to the second movie that is.
There is a bright light in this, and that is Jason London.
anyway, i derailed, that is an 1 for this movie!
I don't think it will win over any new fans, as the storyline needs to be followed from the first part to truly understand everything that is happening.
Firstly, this is a film that is really about more than just raising awareness of the need to vote.
Even if you hate MM, and really disagree with everything he's ever made, you should still agree that his films are a voice that is allowed to be heard.
A super comedy that is all the more funny because it deals with real people like you and I.
The Elephant Man is without a doubt the 'finest' movie david lynch has made, in a sense it doesn't provoke with violence or odd things like Lynch's movies often do, but with pure emotions in a touching drama about the man who just wanted to 'live a normal life', whatever that is.
If you wish to see a David Lynch movie that is going to make you feel bad, angry, and all sorts of emotions then watch this one.
we would be a much better society and it would be a much better world if we could live with even a fraction of the spirituality and love that is in this film
There's one scene with the aunts (grannies) and a priest that is really just out there.
He has a gentlemanly charm that we won't ever see again in the world, even in Merry Old England, and that is so unfortunate.
The film is never gratuitous, and that is much to it's credit.
There is nothing pleasant about The Elephant Man; it is as ugly as it's title character, and that is the way that this story needs to be.
On the surface, it is ugly and repulsive; but just like it's title character; the movie has a hidden depth that is ultimately touching and heartbreaking.
And that is the mark of a great director.
With The Elephant Man, Lynch is saying to the world that it is society that is the monster, not the freaks that live within it.
This is a good sci-fi thriller that is like a father and son movie.
So that is why I love this movie so much!!!
I thought this would be the worth movie ever but I think it is extraordinary.This is a must see.It is about two spoiled girls who burn the kitchen and they have to take a summer job at there dad"s dairy factory, while he goes on vacation,but the sisters run into a lot of problems and they need to find the solution together.I liked the story,the acting was great and the best part is that I can watch this over and over again,not like a lot of movies.I also like the way the sisters realize that they need to think about other people not just themselves.so this is my conclusion:see this movie,if you like Disney,vote on it,comment.that is what I think of this outstanding movie
Before he leaves on a long needed vacation that is Coleman's number 2 guy at the plant, Michael Rhoades, has been urging on him to take in fact he gives him the money to do it, Coleman has both the girls actually get real jobs at the plant to see how the working folks really live.
But still, what he does is wrong.Leaving his wife, his beautiful and sweet wife like that is just wrong.But in the last image of the film you can see some kind of regret on the man's face.He's just married Kelly and he starts humming Close To You, that was played on his wedding with Lila.This movie made me laugh several times.Like the time Lenny lays out all his cards for Kelly's dad wanting to marry his daughter.Guess twice how the old man feels about that.The Heartbreak Kid is a real treat.Everybody should see it.
If that isn't enough, he runs up against Shepherd's father, played with a fine demeanor by Eddie Albert, who conveys the typical WASP feeling.
If you don't know who it is the moment the drama starts you have seen very few movies in your day and the character herself (no I won't spoil) is a tried and true trite stereotype that is more plot device than any character at all.
this film is essentially a lark about by some guys from new Zealand and really that is all it is, I don't think when they made the movie the filmmakers were thinking that this was going to be a world wide blockbuster or an intellectual indie thought provoker they simply made a movie that they thought would be fun and hoped that others would as well.
This is an obviously inspired film that isn't the usual predictable drivel that I see in so many films of this genre.
That pretty much sums up wrist-slitting banality that is YOU MOVE YOU DIE.
Zo has an ethereal quality that is as tangible as her gentle smile, and Trucker finds himself dumbstruck whenever he's in her presence.
With a different wonderfully weird hairdo and hilariously outragious t-shirt in every scene, Ackles brings a deadly combination of sensitivity and hilarity to the character, leading up to a delightfully romantic ending that is sure to leave every woman in the theatre staring up at the screen in love-struck awe.
What a charming message that is, and for a movie that likes to think its so indie how incredibly mainstream of it.
Elizabeth Shue is particularly wasted--emoting to beat the band in a role that is one-note (well, one-and-one-half) and tiresome.
Sam explains he has to get to Hell because that is where Hellcop took his fiancÃ©e.
In particular is his roaming camera that is intricately choreographed and put to great use in large group scenes.
Some do not have plots and everyone knows it, in which case it better have something else that is damn well done!
Some do not have plots and everyone knows it, in which case it better have something else that is damn well done!
But even bigger than that is the true sense of mystery that this film evokes regarding art.
Within the chaos of this film you will find much that is familiar, even if you can't really tell your friends what it's about.
The characters are exiles in a world that is both of their own creation and beyond their control.
The issue that is more important is the color blindness of Rod Serling.
However, the blank cipher that is Benjamin Button remains stubbornly vague.
There was absolutely no point to the scenes at all, the moments of revelation were completely predictable, and how many times do we need a film that is set up by somebody reading a diary?
Truly, David Fincher and Pitt have created a film that is leaps and bounds ahead of its time.
I love that and wish for it, but sadly that is what movies are made for.
And if that is what you've been thinking after or during your viewing of this film, then this film has succeeded.
He winds this clock so well and with such grace that the movie has this undeniable flow that is enjoyable from start to finish.
What great family fun, you must have crowded around the fire and watch this movie burn because that is the only thing this movie is good for.
This is the sort of recipe that more often than not ends up with a mediocre movie that is instantly forgettable but for whatever reasons They ended up producing one of the funniest teen comedies ever made.
This would make a solid rent alongside "Animal House", that is how good "Up the Creek" truly is.
They say it is bad because the dubbing is bad (that is the crappy American company that sold you the movies fault, not the movie) or the transfer was bad.
The film is short and deft, and it takes itself seriously, that is it spares us of gags and laughs.
Hard Boiled-a top notch action film from Hong Kong must be hailed as a true role model for all action films.It is one of the best action films of its kind where speedy action mixes freely with dramatic sequences.This is something which creates a feeling in the minds of viewers that they are not being taken for granted as everything that is being depicted is serving some kind of purpose.One of most amazing things about John Woo's film "Lat sau san taam" is that its actions scenes are truly unbelievable.They have been filmed with such an accurate precision that they would easily put to shame some of the most accomplished artists whose every stroke is the result of immense patience and concise concentration.Hard Boiled is also a film with a bizarre twist as we get to see some hardworking cops mixing freely with hardened criminals.Although gang violence is a core issue of the film John Woo has not deceived fans of melodrama by showing how difficult it is to lead a life of a cop.The best part of this film comes in the form of John Woo appearing every now and then Ã  la Alfred Hitchcock.
This movie has EVERYTHING, grenades, shotguns, machine pistols and an entire arsenal of weapons that is shown in the hospital part.
The true brilliance of Woo's films lies in the fact that he never sacrifices story for action, but instead blends the two together to create a whole that is artistically rendered (his action sequences are something akin to visual poetry) and substantial, rather than having an action film that-- like so many others of the genre-- is hollow inside.
John Woo's interests are shown through Tequila's passion of jazz and the beautiful and dark cinematography of Hong Kong, which, when combined together, gives an effect that signifies two different worlds, that is, the life of a cop and the life of a criminal.
Except for one or two sequences, they don't play against each other, they play with each otherÂa feat that is more difficult to bring off successfully.
This is where the clichÃ©s come from, they were the first people to do these things... And that is what you have to remember when watching this film, it is truly a snapshot in to the creation of rock and roll.
It is a triumph of style over substance, though the substance comes damn near close to the style of Scorsese's direction that is later seen in his other triumphs (you get the feeling you've seen every type of shot before in this film if you've seen other Scorsese pictures).
which ain't bad,, i guess i'm used to lots of action , gunplay,, something,, although there is a lot of good ole fashioned nudity in here, i just i would call this movie very disjointed at times and that is being kind, this movie took a few years to make,, and now i think i see why.
SUDDENLY is a great example of a film that is exceptionally simple but it manages to pack a mighty wallop.
The aspiring journalist Diane Armstrong gets a job at the strip club but the story centres around other character subplots for a couple of minutes that don't really lead anywhere and one can't help thinking the character of Diane is used to set up the story just so writer/director Ice Cube can use the location to play a soundtrack that is composed of mainly Ice Cube tracks .
A deep love slowly blossoms between him and his step-sister, Thorley (Teresa Wright), but his step-brother Adam (John Rodney) gradually begins to deeply resent his presence; something that is twisted into something even darker and more hateful when Jed returns home a war hero.
The big "secret" that is revealed at the end was easily guessed a long time before the big revelation.
I think a good indicator that this was intended as a laugh is the drawing of a UFO on a piece of lined notebook paper that is clearly being held up so the cameraman can shoot it.
I personally cannot pin point any one thing that isn't as good, but the feel of it, the jokes, the stories...
I wouldn't go as far as saying that it's the funniest thing I've EVER seen, but that isn't all that makes it my favourite program.
The subtitles (the film is in French) are so out of sync with the film that they completely destroy the important conversations, so much so that many times the subtitles are finishing off a scene that is no longer on the screen!
Afther Kainan is accepted by a Viking community that is being attacked by the Moorwen, he decide to help them kill that beast by the old way (no guns).
), and , believe it or not , a story that IS quite original : a space craft crashes on Earth ,and only one survives , well, two , but the other thing is nonhuman , very nasty and rather horrifying- H.R.Giger would be proud - and , yes , has a huge appetite for humans, but even that is brilliantly explained , as the human race in its quest for resources obliterates anything that lives on any planet,and not asking any questions , but simply sending the fleets of colonizers after the campaign 's been done !
All told, it was a great film that is much better than the crummy marketing and support would suggest.
This release dumped unceremoniously into theaters in the early year scrap heap is certainly a movie that is fully aware of its preposterous nature and approaches it with a straight face, a talented cast and premier production values that all work oddly well to produce an entertaining if far from perfect Sci-fi cult classic.
The other, the challenger, is a Lithuanian, political exile that is refugee in another country.
What the hell is that show..This is basically what American teenagers looks like...This how MTV portrays them..wow... Laguna Beach does the same thing...All spoiled teenagers which the prize of the things they own is sometimes mistaken for their phone numbers!...They look like those women that freaks out on their wedding day!..You know the TV show..They don't know how fortunate they are and They dare to complain...i live in Canada and to me that is a culture shock If this how teen girls are......well...they would feel like living in a Survivor in Canada...we are not poor..not at all...But come on...this is ridiculous and even pitiful...poor parents...  Its probably the worst TV reality show ever!
They have no respect, no manners and are genuinely awful people, they symbolise everything that is wrong with the world.
Frank Sinatra became such a legend in his own lifetime as a singer, a symbol, an actor, and a subject of controversy that there is little to really find that is unusual to talk about concerning him.
In conclusion this show is a MUST avoid, and if you're a tad curious, watch 5 minutes of this show, if you manage to last that long without wanting to gouge your own eyes out that is...
There is not one birthday girl, or boy, on this show that isn't overly indulged and undeserving "trailer trash"...spoiled, stupid and totally without any real "class".
Its a lot of fun watching the really fake shark that isn't scary at all,you will crack up when you see the shark coming out of the water with his head.
Its a lot of fun watching the really fake shark that isn't scary at all,you will crack up when you see the shark coming out of the water with his head.
Yes, it is corny, but given the timeframe, that is to be expected.
How do you review of film that is too bizarre, too extreme and generally too unique for words?
The two enjoy a very hot sexual relationship that is vividly but not graphically depicted.
Another thing that is so great about CPW is that it wasn't so completely wild, stupid, idiotic and over the top like Melrose often was.
The big fight scene that happens at the deserted house at night is so dark that is practically unwatchable.
Yes It's true, and perhaps the film will find more fans as a result and I think that is great.
At least that is my take.
"A touch of Zen", the English title is perhaps the only thing about this film that isn't beautifully and subtly conceived...
This understated quality to the skills is sometimes disappointing (if that is why you are watching the film), but ends up being the best way to capture the the unknowable skills of some of the characters.
Ku's life gets a little more interesting when he notices strange people walking around town, a mysterious man visiting his studio and befriending him, and some strange noises coming from a house that is rumoured to be haunted.
It does not patronise the viewer with overly sentimental gushing that is needlessly inserted in order to generate a love interest.
The script is a mishmash that is almost completely without dialogue or logic.
The movie speaks of an island where one can change the course of one's life, an island that floats like a raft atop the sea, that is so full of caves as to be nearly hollow, so that each of the many holes you may fall into is really a tunnel that will take you somewhere else.
It's because she is on that island that Elena gets to meet Lorenzo, and she really reunites Lorenzo and the mother of his child, resolves their story.
Take note, those used to there being credits aplenty throughout the RTS titles they play, as I can't off-hand think of another game that isn't pretty much like that.
Of course, that is a minor complaint.
Where WarCraft 2's storyline was excessively simple, and the Orc and Human campaigns were concurrent (that is, they're just two different perspectives on the same story, happening at the same time), StarCraft's storyline is as rich and detailed as a sci-fi novel, full of dissention, assassination, and alliances made and broken.
There was only one thing that made this movie worth wasting two hours watching it and that is Paul Walker!!!
There's even a couple of scenes I could have dealt without, but still they're in there, and quite frankly the makers of this film did a great job with what they had to work with and created a nostalgic, yet entertaining flick that is fun to watch from beginning to end.
It's a peaceful movie about the peace that is always there for a given person, their journey being to find it.
This is certainly not the best Japanese movie ever, there are a bit too much technical flaws (could partially have been due to a bad tape though, I've seen it on the Brussels BIFFF festival), and a bit too many clichÃ©'s in the plot, and the gore was a bit too soft(for a movie advertised as a horror movie, that is) it doesn't really have something to stand out from the rest of the new Japanese movie....except for its atmosphere...really liked the atmosphere, which had a lot to do with the decors, which were very well put together.... the two people who I went to see the movie with hated it, mainly for the flaws I've mentioned before, but I guess this is a typical case of "if you concentrate too much on the flaws you'll hate it, otherwise it just might grab you, and you're in for a very enjoyable ride"  So to be brief: I loved it but I can't really recommend it...still I'll give it an 8, mainly to promote a talented filmmaker which I'm sure will deliver a few brilliant movies if he gets the budget he deserves
Anyway, while they're all trapped in the elevator, Luchino does the usual Japanese school girl violence thing (that is, if you've watched a lot of Japanese movies) and it's not pretty either.
Thankfully, HELLEVATOR is a very accessible, very watchable science fiction flick that is not trying to answer the meaning of life, just deliver 90 minutes of first class entertainment.
And what the school district wanted to do in the Dover case was so insignificant, that is, inform kids that another theory existed.
However, ultimately, it's a disappointing, sometimes mildly amusing, hypocritical, smug documentary that is nevertheless not totally devoid of value about an important subject.
And that is really unfortunate.
Liev Schreiber, as Mischa, made the character into a complete buffoon (perhaps that is what Kassovitz intended).
Jakob, then carries on the lie,and later is forced to carry on the lie, that he has a radio, to keep the hope alive, in the end dies , but doesn;t let go , just so that people already close to death under the Nazis, don't lose whatever hope that is left.
The film also manages to convey a significant existential quality to the main characters that is very nuanced and requires contemplation.
To put up a first feature that is not plot driven or is not a formulaic comedy looking for easy adulation definitely took guts on the director/writer's part.
Then I saw from one of the more recent reviewers that it was sabotage and I can only believe that that is the case.
Pay no attention to the 2.2 - that is a fabrication.
I actually think that might grab the essence of my thoughts, too, but to me that is positive criticism whereas that other reviewer is using it as a negative.
Eric Byler's direction is careful, measured and free of gimmicks; and the story is notable as a story with an Asian-American cast that isn't about ethnicity, but instead zeroes in on general human dilemmas.
Justin is a self-absorbed ladies man that is unwilling to share himself emotionally.
The last ten minutes are among the worst ever commited to celluloid in movie that is trying to take itself seriously.
And another problem that is also tied to the script is the fact that the movie is overly long.
It begins with a action-filled sequence that really wakes your interest and curiosity, but the questions that arise in the beginning doesn't get answered, only more and more questions and that is very annoying.
You will also see that a lot of the people in the American version are in the British version, and I enjoy that a lot, but I also get to see a lot of the talented and funny British comedians, too, so that is also great.
The only thing in this film that is not sensually romantic is that the computer is a PeeCee and not a Mac.
Every time I watch a film by Julio Medem, the same thing happens to me, and that is that I feel weightless and it feels like time is slower and the images have a different color.
What call my attention the most is that, I have the feeling that Medem tried to get away from his past with this story but ended up coming back to it, which is a great thing in the sense that the poetry and melancholy that is always present in his movies, are also part of this one.
But, and now for the review part, poking fun at stuff that happens to everyone every day, or stuff that is so simple, you can't almost imagine how to make it funny, that is another trick.
And thus he delivered a show that is as funny now as it was years ago.
It is more than that, it is the complex storytelling that tangles the characters in this movie and the way that is told.
This timeless, nameless place befit a film that is grounded in abstract and existential themes rather than plot as the women characters are caught up in an endless cycle of waiting Â Lollipop for her son, Sakina's grandmother for her tenants and her own son, and Sakina for her lover.
Both directors possess a unique touch with color, texture and cinematic air quality that is truly able to transport the viewer into their story, completely and delightedly.
This movie is all about set action pieces and how well they can be executed...that that is pretty darn well.
"The Empire in Africa" is a courageous examination of a tragic and complex topic, the civil war in Sierra Leone, its propaganda-driven portrayal in the international media, the global commercial interests at stake, the regional and international contribution to the continued violence and the effects on the civilian population of war and poverty in a country that is extremely wealthy in natural resources.
We delve into the complicated and frightening (yet very tragic) character that is Sadako Yamamura.
If you remember this movie and need more retro animation that isn't animated like sh*t, watch "rock and rule".
I really only had difficulty in one section and that is only because I was pushing the wrong button like an idiot.
I'm not a man that is into mindless movies like Dude Where's My Car?, Bill & Ted Excellent Adventure, or Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle for examples.
"Walk Like a Man" can't hold a candle to the film-making wizardry that is Plan 9 From Outer Space.
The result is a movie that is supposed to be comedy that instead of making you laugh makes you cringe as every pathetic line that tries to be funny is outdone by an even more pathetic line.
I haven't seen the film in a while (that is a good thing) but can remember the basic outline of the plot and story.
You are not surposed to take it that way and if you cauld make a better film about giant spiders for under $1.5 million for that is what this film costs i would be pleased to review it for you.
There is some claptrap that is never really explored about inanimate objects being mystical focuses of belief and power, which is thrown in as an explanation for the Aztec cloak/dresses' power, which is quite forgettable.
Also there are so many things in the book which relates to my real life one of them that is less personal is how in the book the girls name is Kate, which is my name, and her daughters name is Jill, which is my moms name.
It is indeed a most beautiful heartfelt movie that is timeless, as it touches aspects of life that cannot be lost with changes over the decades.
Thank-you so much, I am so grateful to YouTube, cause that is where my search started tonight and the rest is history!!!
I see that is rated 7.4 and I don't understand why that many bad movies with bad ratings are on the market but this isn't.
(Boy, what a surprise that is!)
They didn't hire a crew to come in and apply a dozen coats of paint and polish it to a glass-like shine -- while that result is appealing and good, there is also merit in an artwork that is deemed "finished" by the artist but for which the audience knows it could be done differently.
It had a type of brutal honesty (quite charming in and of itself) and real-life quality that is, sadly, only found in independent films these days.
If that isn't bad enough, Lucy dies not long afterward of a sedative overdose.
Sadly, that is not the case.
One of those socially conscious pictures that is just too polite and well intentioned for its own good.
Brian Aherne does a special job with his role here, and carries the day, but that isn't all there is to this one.
All that is pretty entertaining already, but the real fun starts when they discover a vampire bat inside the facility.
His mother (Stockard Channing) comes up with a solution to their problems that is quite original, and probably only possible in Canada.
At times, I found it inappropriate for the subject, but perhaps that is also the message: we can laugh despite the hardships.
Employing cinematography of enormous talent and a cast of terrific actors, Fitzgerald manages to share his stories with such sensitivity that every viewer will feel involved in the tragedy that is rotting away our globe.
But that is a small flaw in a film of wonder.
There is worst to come;the entirely intrusive and impossible to listen to score destroys the very things you expect from a Gary Daniels movie,namely the action.His two long and protracted fight scenes include some good techniques as you would expect from Gary but unfortunately look like they were filmed by a blind cameraman suffering from Parkinson's disease.In any case they are ruined by that God awful music which even drowns out the fight sound effects and you have to ask yourself if any of the technical team working on BLACK FRIDAY had even so much as seen a movie before let alone worked on one.I have watched many of Gary's movies several times in the past(BLOODMOON,RIOT,RECOIL)but could never envisage watching this catastrophe again.If you can imagine what the worst episode of "Miami Vice" would have been like if performed by the most inept actors and crew money could buy then that gives you some idea of how bad BLACK FRIDAY IS.I have some advice for director Darren Doane and that is..in future Darren,don't!
He brings a depth to his character, that is lacking in so many TV movies.
The mystery aspect that is the backbone of the story is well thought out.
"Wildcats" is a football movie that is pretty predictable, but nevertheless it's very entertaining.
The only thing that is worth noticing is that Woody Harrelson, Wesley Snipes and Mykelti Williamson made one of their first appearances here, before Harrelson became famous as Woody Boyd and before he and Snipes were made a team in several films.
Why some people think this is so funny is beyond me because everything that is done here has been done better somewhere else.
A way to learn more about this kind of music that is famous around the world as "the dance of passion", but showed in its pure essence, with three of its' men, Gardel, DiscÃ©polo and Piazzolla.
A movie about the most commonly used four letter word in the English language that is more interested in bashing right wing nut jobs.
Like every other documentary about something that is "bad" as we are told growing up, this was made to be funny and fun to watch.
This is the modern way and this movie has a very modern all-world perspective on life that is refreshing.
the film feels like an old fashioned horror m,movie from the 80's and as far as i'm concerned that is a great thing.
And with sheer luck this movie lands on my lap and I read somewhere that is a classic story with a forgotten method of movie making.
Chances are that the place that has this movie is pretty much a marsh that is sinking down to a bottomless pit.
At lot of that is due to the subtlety of the sound - it does not overpower or try to manipulate - it merely stays mostly in the background and enhances the suspense rather than detract.
Well made supernatural thriller that is short on gore but still has plenty of atmosphere and scares.
This film is nothing short of perfection: it has heart-pounding adventure, nerve-wracking suspense, gut-busting humor, exhilerating action, wonderful characters, an excellent plot, sheer unpredictability, romance that isn't nauseating or cheesy, and a brilliant script.
The ultimate villain-ghost that is finally revealed to have triggered the events is actually just a rather misguided and pathetic character so when they came over all demonic at the end it rang really hollow for me.
She (and her editor) ably knows how to fix up the business side of Stacy (grabbing a broom to sweep away ants from a pool-side scene or gamely dealing with artificial smoke that is choking her on the set) and the human side of Stacy (sharing a very emotional, tearful moment with her mother or interrupting an in-vehicle interview with a realistic "You fu**er, nice turn signal"!).
That's what I mean by subtle, you almost miss it and then you can't explain to yourself what it is that is so incredibly funny about what he's doing.
Aunty ji cleans, starches and irons "Mr. Toad"'s underwear because that is what all Indian mothers do.
We too must be open and interested if we want to live in a world that is increasingly global and challenging.
A bit idealistic and old-fashioned, but perhaps that is exactly what draws me to films like these?
And I think that's something that is discarded very easily today.
But the bottom line and the message that we seem to constantly forget is that; We need to always be aware that we are all from the one family of LIFE and that we are all on the same journey in or on this one minute little speck of terra, atmosphere and water, and that we all share the outcome that is put into action.
It's one of those stupid college prank movies that is just bad.
"The Bridge" contains all that is important in a full length film, yet keeps the watcher entertained from beginning until end, with no dull, near pointless moments in between.
This movie has been criticized for Duvall's appearance as an aged man; the movie's bad dancing; Dufall's arrogance in making a movie that is "his baby" alone and other attacks too numerous to mention.
This is unknown film that isn't fully appreciated not only with the public but with the reviewers here.
", so if Garrison is that f****** bizarre what's going on that is for him really crazy?
And that is what makes the show special.
How lucky we are that all that is gone.
It's not only the breathtaking adventure I remembered; it's a fiery and surprisingly gentle romance that isn't afraid of laughs.
Perhaps we are too haste with that decision, because as our story unfolds, as does the bond that connects these two individuals Â or at least that is what Wargnier would like us to think.
Little did Alexei and Marie knew about the dismal housing problems of those years when the family is given a large room in an apartment that is being shared by five families!
Interesting plot to this RPG that is not overdone.
Melies, I feel, remains the most accessible of the oldest directors, in large part because of the sheer sense of showmanship and joy that is evident in these works.
There is an exuberance in seeing something done for the first time that is sorely lacking in later uses of the same editing effect.
Maybe I am just an immature 42 year old but I was cracking up at parts, and for someone my age that is unusual for a kids film.
But why on earth should we seek for the companionship that is hard to imagine between enemies during the war?
Very relatable storyline that is heartfelt and honestly told.
Definitely worth watching for wit and charm that is brought to the table by this troupe of Australian surfers and their friends.
It begins with the crashing pilot noticing a moth and it ends with the final image that is both heartfelt and bittersweet.
The title refers to a metaphor, but one that is so plain dumb it's not worth repeating.
A fine movie which addresses a subject that is now relevant in England if not other countries.
In yet another collaboration with director Anthony Minghella ("Cold Mountain," "The Talented Mr. Ripley"), Jude Law plays Will, an architect who, with his partner Sandy (Martin Freeman), has just set up shop in King's Cross, a London neighborhood that is on the cusp of being gentrified but which still is known for its high crime rate.
He has a smile & charm that is dazzling,.
Taken literally, it refers to the several break-ins that occur throughout the beginning of the film that spiral everything that is to follow.
And that is exactly what Breaking and Entering is, and this time around I truly enjoyed the film even though it's far from being great.
And that is also the case of Robin Wright Penn's character and her daughter from Sweden.
This is Minghella's most moving film to date - and that is saying something.
Gabriel Yared has collaborated with Karl Hyde and Rick Smith to create a score that is rich and modern.
The film does not have a very original story and is fairly predictable but that is okay because it is not really plot-driven.
Its a snowy night,but they just gotta get that kid(terribly played by Deanna Milligan,for the whole film she makes silly noises that is supposed to portray a sick child)to the hospital.The plane takes off and everything seems fine but ten minutes into the journey,something.......goes wrong.The engine fails.At this point in the review I must point out that the plane going down scene is pretty good with outdoor and indoor cockpit shots of the disaster about to happen.
Imagine that is a funny film.
But worst than that is the absolute unbelievability of the four leads in their roles.
the plot is simple and that is it's greatest flaw.
I had heard good reviews before finally seeing this movie and am already a fan of the horror genre.For a gay slasher film it was done tastefully.I like a movie like this that is more realistic instead of being b-rated and campy.I am glad the gay characters were more normal instead of showing all the negative stereotypes that a lot of TV shows and movies show.It's refreshing to see a regular gay movie about ordinary(but pretty)people in realistic circumstances.In some ways it's just eye candy since every character was cute and sexy,but no different then a lot of other movies.This movie has a good story,good actors,and nice effects with the right amount of suspense,gore and humor.It is very well directed,produced as well as acted.I hope a sequel is made to understand the motive to the killings and to see who is behind that demonic mask.
His fellow friends are zippy, tight, and fun loving and along the way many of them fall victim to the 'devil's scythe' (and yes, that is shown in grisly detail!).
Write what you know about and what you feel (that is, lust for guys, not for girls).
Here we have the sequel, Lake Placid 2, which takes place in Maine, in a lake that is not called Lake Placid... but let's not sweat the details.
If the FX weren't so horribly bad (I assume they were made on a Commodore 64) it wouldn't be so horrible (the script still needs some work), but they are so amateur and dated that the film simply can't be taken seriously at all, making the performances seem ridiculously over acted, (the performances that is, not the 'actors' that turned up for one day of shooting to take their clothes off, stage some unconvincing scenes and swim in filthy lake).
", he thinks it's a joke and still doesn't appear to hear the croc that is about 3 feet from him!
Unlike "House of the Dead", it isn't a bad movie that is funny to watch because of how much effort was put into it, it's just an all-out bad movie that Sci Fi can add to their quite long "Flops" list.
David Kelly's original script had some intelligence, great character development and nicely-done humor that is really missing here.
His wife stays with him, but, after Vlad seemingly comes back to life after his soldiers were convinced that he was killed in battle, she becomes convinced that her husband is a damned soul; that is to say, that his spirit is doomed to remain in limbo on earth forever because neither Heaven nor Hell will receive him.
The movie deals with the so-called historical figure of Vlad Tepes (phonetically that is "Tzepesh" and it literally means "Impaler"), not the vampire of Bram Stoker but the tormented Wallachian (Romanian) medieval ruler that stood against the might of the Ottoman Empire with nothing but a few trained men of his own and his reputation as master of psychological warfare by means of sheer terror and unprecedented scale of prisoner execution through impalement (Google on that for detailed info).
Vlad the Impaler, that is the son of Vlad Dracul, inherited his father's membership into the order of the Dragon, but because he was the son of Dracul, he was named "Draculea", or "Dracula", which means "son of Dracul", son of the Dragon, and ultimately son of the devil.
There is also a secret that is eventually revealed, and sort of explains why things are the way they are.
heartbreaking and hilarious, with art direction that is a knock-out!
The Lost World is a wonderfully entertaining film which incorporates stop motion techniques to bring the dinosaurs of the movie to life in a manner that is really incredible for the time.
The movie is a Masterpiece of early Special Effects I especially like when the Brotosaurus escapes the cage & breaks loose terrorizing the streets of London that is very memorable.
It's an unexpected touch of subtlety in a film that is geared towards drama and conflict.
Each brings something different that is crucial to the movie's success, and the entire package would have been brought down severely without either of them.
I've found a new perennial favorite, one that is perfect for every third Thursday in March.
Once in a while a movie comes along that is a gift for an actor.
All three deliver performances that easily merit a Best Actor Oscar, but it is the chemistry between Penn and Oldman that issue forth true gold.
It is a relatively simple plot with a very linear progression that is carried by the wonderful performance of Lon Chaney.
Sure, there isn't enough violence or gore, but that is the way that it was intended to be.
His success is one that is grounded in his macabre but decidedly non-supernatural silent works.
Mirroring that is a scene when he distractedly lights a cigarette with his feet, an intricate process that was aided by Peter Dismuki, a real armless man who served as a stunt double for many of Chaney's actions.
The czar Nicholas I, tired of the endless fight that is costing him money and armies, gives a letter to Princess Maria (Scilla Gabel) to be handed to her husband Prince Sergei (Gerard Herter), containing instructions to negotiate a peace treaty with the rebels.
Now this film was made with very little money and sometimes that is really noticeable.
Probably not all of them, but certainly the leads and many characters.This gave the film a reality that is unmistakable.
These actors ineptly try to portray gay life in L.A., but with laughably bad dialog and very unconvincing performances they accomplish to make a movie that is essentially un-funny, un-touching and unfulfilling to watch!
The story is fairly fast-paced and most of the characters actually have personalities and interact with little of the stoicism and blandness that is often found in science fiction movies.
A rape/murder takes place in a forest that is infamous as a mecca for suicide.
Torn between convention and contemporary ideals, the present generation is gradually coming up with a new set of scales, one that is neither completely Indian nor global.
There is also an unnecessary rape scene in the film (which seems to go hand-in-hand with hillbilly killers nowadays) that is so poorly constructed that it's not even close to being disturbing, which is actually kind of scary in itself.
Right after that, we go to a charming funeral scene where a daughter slaps her father and that is hilarious, really the only entertaining second of the film.
A horror movie that is fourth in a series should be terrible.
The only thing lifting this above total non-entity is a bit of decent gore for fans of the red stuff and even that is all over during the first half of the film (the first couple of kills are the best and then it's down hill all the way).
I'll make this as concise as possible: Terrible Script, Poor continuity, God-awful acting, Plot holes a plenty, Direction with no style, Horror movie that isn't frightening.
She looks extremely similar to the granddaughter of the psychic from the original, and I believe, that if everything from part I WAS a dream, then he knew that girl from a separate dimension of reality, the reality we never knew, that is, until we saw glimpses of it in part IV.
Like one great philospher said, "When the end is upon us, that is where the beginning may arrive."
But that is probably a good place to begin.
I have to say I find it difficult to join in the chorus of 'masterpiece' preceding this comment but that is not to dismiss it out of hand.
There's a disconnect emotionally that is left open, thus, going into the second half of the film, where finally we see what some of us would be waiting for: the serial killer plot.
The Butcher posits a relationship that is platonic, naturalistic, and genuinely interesting; these aren't cookie-cutter characters but well-drawn and with things that make them identifiable even as they, early on, seem to go on about trivial things not related to the plot (a little like a Woody Allen movie).
One thing that is particularly striking is that he is able to use long, unshowy takes (some lasting several minutes) simply because his actors are up to the challenge, giving the film an unforced, natural flow.
Chabrol manages to transform picnics, schoolhouses and cobblestone streets into a landscape that is horrifying for its lack of apparent horror and for its incongruity with the horror being committed.
The schoolteacher never could have foreseen the effect she would have on the butcher, but she is still responsible, and that is what is terrifying.
The killings are merely an outward symbol for the internal murder that is going on within each character.
During the excursion with her class to a cave in the woods, Helene finds the last victim of a serial killer that is stabbing young women in the area.
And it is slow but that is part of the movie's action.
He's right, there is something in her look there that is very different from concern or sadness; I'd say it is the look of triumph.
"Policewomen" is an action/adventure film that is worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of women's martial arts.
The story is a crime-fighting caper that is enhanced by a good musical score.
"; the villains' henchwomen hijacking an 'atomic nucleus' by dressing up as can-can girls stranded in the desert; a 120-second countdown that is long enough for someone to run away, escape the villains' lair, fly a helicopter along the longest road in Europe, land, get out, go to a cafÃ© and phone Londonn (in the days before direct international dialling) before it gets to 35 seconds on the clock; and a climax that sees a group of Scottish championship archers riding to the rescue through the snow to the villain's underground lair, the entrance to which is cunningly disguised as a small hut opposite a castle a few miles outside Munich.
It pays to watch this movie closely, as there is a lot that is implied and innuendoed.
Ayres' baby-faced good looks and polished exterior were supposed to clash with the reality of the gangster that he was - that is part of the whole point of the film.
Also interesting is Louie's almost-friendship with Captain Pat O'Grady, the cop that is determined to get Louie and his gang off the street once and for all.
This film is so much better than you'd think, and that is due not only to fine performances by Ayres and Cagney (make that, a WONDERFUL performance by Cagney, who really does ignite the screen), but also to impressive direction by Archie Mayo.
One of the main problems (there are many) with HRH is that the audience's appreciation for entertainment is neglected; and that is a big problem if you create anything to stimulate an audience.
The editor, Lisa Donette May, is another culprit for the catastrophe that is HRH through neglecting to control the finished state of this movie: there are so many pointless scenes where nothing happens and thus slow down a no-go film.
The good thing about that is that you're able to see what is going on.
But it's a great thrill ride that is just fun to watch.
Yes friends, D'Amato does it again with another sleaze film that is sure to burrow it's way into all TRUE trash lovers hearts...IMAGES IN A CONVENT is that rare kinda film that D'Amato is sooooo good at.
Along with the laughs are a few tears, something that is not always evident in Allen's films.
Like most autobiographical works this film has a resonance that isn't present in other works.
Sometimes I think some of Allen's work is overrated but, boy, here is one that is definitely underrated.
Alas-genre regular Richard Harrison is no where to be seen having by this time presumably escaped his contract with the aforementioned cinematic crooks (in fact Harrison reportedly felt so sullied by his experiences with Lai and Ho and their deceitful film making techniques that he more or less retired from the industry)  In his honoured place however steps forward Pierre Kirby (who also appeared in the demented classic that is 'Zombie vs Ninja', aka 'Zombie Rival-The Super Ninja Master') who actually does many of his own stunts and martial arts.
16 mins cut out, and that is the version which is showed on HBO and stuff, not just the 16 mins, but the soundtrack is different.
It's a fun, entertaining buddy/road movie that is guaranteed to leave a smile on your face.
If you are looking for a film that is a proper action film with non-stop action, stunts and fights scenes then you have come to the right place.
I strongly recommend this film to anyone who has seen Dacascos before as this is surly his finest film, and also to anyone that is intrigued by an American martial arts film that can hold its own against its Chinese counterpart.
You might have experienced the situation someone's telling a joke that is not only well known but also badly presented.
Well, I read in some of the reviews here that the story is not really highly original and that is indeed true.
Not having seen the original I can't compare the two and maybe that is for the better, because often a re-make loses it from the original, simply for that is not the original.
This movie has been made with only one intention and that is to make as much fun as possible and to keep the audience laughing at regular times.
And don't get me wrong, I love goofy action movies - The Last Boy Scout is one of my all time favorites and so are Donner's Lethal Weapon films - but enough is enough and it is a real breath of fresh air to see a great action director, an action star, and a rapper (or hip hop guy, I am not good at distinguishing that sort of thing) deliver a film that is good both dramatically and action-wise.
The fact that this movie was remade, that is.
Actually that is what the story is about.
Jack Mosley (Bruce) is a stunning character that is willing to go all the way to do the right thing.
Stallone's Carter is one that is trying to do something right for once in his life.
On top of that, the story is changed so we have a different ending that is FAR less powerful than that of the original Get Carter.
For example, we go from Caine's Carter's intimidating "like p**s-holes in the snow" description of Eric's eyes to Stallone's Carter's laughable "like cat-p**s in the snow" description of Cyrus' (whoever that is) eyes.
Sure it has the sort of usual happy ending, but that is just the American Way of ending action movies.
I had heard about this film and about how underrated it was,then last week i saw a copy of it on ebay on VHS PAL UK.I was really surprised as i didn't think it had ever been released in the UK.It must be one of the rarest videos in Britain as sadly not many people have heard of it.Luckily i won it for just over Â£3 not bad eh.So if any one else is interested in buying a copy,there must be others available in Britain,if you really look around.I couldn't wait to watch this film,and i must say i wasn't disappointed.Its starts off a mildly amusing story that suddenly gets sadder and sadder until it reaches a climax to a very tragic ending.I must admit the last 10 seconds of this film does bring tears to the eyes,i wont say why,but try and see this movie and you will see.The acting between Gary Cooper and Anna Sten is first rate,her character is very likable as she is totally unselfish,and is trying to please everyone,so she does deserve happiness.Garys character,well he is married and his wife is not a monster and she does love him,so you feel sorry for her as well,i think you have to decide for yourself in a triangle like this someone is always going to get hurt,but you don't know who.Also this is a very early film showing us cultural differences and the sort of conflicts that can arise when two people from very different back grounds want to be together.Can it work?he is from a literate sophisticated family,she is from a poor immigrant family that is still trying to learn new ways.The answer is if two people really love each other then they can over come their differences as true love conquers all,i think overall this was the strongest message that comes out of this film,to some people the married issue may be the point of the film.Any way this is a very haunting film and well worth watching if you get the chance.
Interesting film, partly because Cooper is cast so completely against the type he is later to be best known for from his Capra films - that is of the rural innocent encountering the corruption of the city.
)This indeed is one of those films that is so bad it's almost good.
But, as we all know by now, that is the nature of "thrillers."
This works better than the later sound version, although that is also pretty interesting.
A lot of films take the escapist approach to deviate its content from real life; in my opinion that is a perfectly legitimate way to make films, and while Singles certainly has its share of over-the-top moments (which are highly enjoyable), I found it to resemble life more than most genre films.
And while I never believe that he IS Dean Martin, Northam does create a character that is interesting to watch for about 45 minutes.
Embarrassing performances by such "luminaries" as Richard Burton, Walter Matthau, James Coburn, and Marlon Brando were obviously turned in for scale- that is, the scale the director must've used to weigh out the dope that permeates this piece of tripe.
Just when I thought that the movie was going to have me accepting the epiphany as a typical Hollywood clichÃ©, it offers an explanation that is quite believable.
"The Water Horse" a fantasy that is light and family-friendly, but also carries an important life lesson.
If you want to see some well done writing that is done in real time (1 hr video is 1 hr of story), watch 24.
One addition of the film that is not too bothersome is that the water horse is not very cute at all when he is "fully grown".
The Water Horse is a very family-friendly movie that is part Sc-Fi, fantasy and adventure.
All-in-all, The Water Hores is a movie that is definitely a suggested viewing for those looking for something a little different and fun.
And what I mean by that is it has several layers of varying stories all unfolding at the same time, something that goes a bit beyond the cute and fuzzy.
She is of a timeless beauty that is so rare these days.
The final moments have good heart that is not forced but earned.
What most of the stories suffer from is incredibly long passages of introducing of characters and that is way stretched and often even unnecessary for the plod.
Obliged to commit to the idea of subjective camera placement (that is, generally taking the perspective of the boy), Zhang evinces great subtlety and restraint.
The film is a little slow in parts and Gong Li plays her role so well that she is most disagreeableÂthat is, until what I might call the "turn."
But that is something she can never admit to herself as she spies on Cuihua with her lover.
And that is the trenchant reality behind the great beauty of any Zhang Yimou film.
A reviewer emailed me that "Midnight Run" not only has a story like "16 Blocks" but Bruce Willis' character Jack Mosley has a name that is a composite of the movie names for two of the leading roles in "Midnight Run": Robert De Niro's Jack Walsh and Yaphet Kotto's FBI Agent Alonzo Mosely.
He also has a riddle that is not answered till near the end of the film.
Gong-Li and film making partner Zhang Yimou have another fine hit; in a series that is beautiful filmmaking as well as one the government would find disapproving of the reality of triads.
Harold loses the love of his life and wants to end it all.His all suicide attempts are failures.But he ends up marrying a pretty girl and ends up with her in a mansion that is spooked by a wicked uncle who wants to scare the young people away so he can have the place for himself.Alfred J. Goulding and Hal Roach are the directors of Haunted Spooks (1920).It's great to watch Harold Lloyd do his comedy.Mildred Davis is beautiful and brilliant as the girl.She would become Harold's real-life wife three years later.The film has lots of fun during its 25 minutes.It's awfully funny to watch Harold and Mildred in a car while those chicken and ducks peck him in the head.And comedy meets tragedy in all those suicide attempts.Lloyd sacrificed two of his fingers when a prop bomb exploded in his hand.What wouldn't Harold have done for comedy?
In Haunted Spooks though we have a film that is ingenious, hilarious and inspired.
I know some over-serious types find the subject distasteful but that is to miss the comment which is the fine line between tragedy and comedy, a subject all the finest of the silent comedians (Chaplin, Lloyd, Keaton) understood well and exploited to wonderful effect.
It's a movie that is made great by having an amazing cast making well written characters come to life, and this is in big part because Sandler and Drew have amazing chemistry.
The bride, that is.
The movie says that love is all you need; and that is a worthwhile message in any movie.
The movie's message is lost somewhat under the barrage of jokes; but it's most certainly there and I for one think that it's a shame that a movie that is entertaining and funny can't be considered in the same league as other, more serious movies with a similar message.
Each episode is packed with little skits that is set up like watching T.V.
I would recommend this to anyone that is a fan of The Simpson's, Futurerama, Ren & Stimpy, Southpark, Star Wars, The Smurfs, and SO MANY other shows that Robot Chicken spoofs - It's animated action figures & toys!!!
This is an amazing movie that is worth seeing, renting, anything!
Nola she was so much different from many of the charters out there and I loved how her character development through out the story and how she actually learned something in the end.People creating movies think that if th guy is hot or the women is hot and a story is horrible the the movie will still do good and yes that is true but this one had all thing tied in it!
I do love the American Russian and Chinese Children of the world and that is why I want Humanity to remain as dignified as possible.
It also wasn't offending to the Hearing people in my class, so that is a plus for any Hearing person looking at this movie.
With poor lighting (this is a low budget affair), amazingly overwrought acting, amateurish production values, a plot that's not too original-and that is dated even by the standards of the time, and a hilarious looking Satan in the film's climax (it's actually the Devil Suit from "Rosemary's Baby", only with a tacky mask added to it), there seems to be plenty for fans of camp to enjoy, but in reality it's just a bore.
And the question to that is what the film is all about, done in interogationstyle by cop Harvey Keitel.
But brilliant picture that is....
Demi is the type that is really believable in this, there aren't a lot of other actresses that have the ability to reach the emotionally burned-out look and feel that Moore does in this.
Bruce Willis does what he does best; that is to say, he's annoying to the point where I was hoping someone would kill him and put us all out of our misery, even though I thoroughly enjoyed his character when he wasn't being mean to his wife.
I didn't see it coming but others could believably so - but even if that is the case the film works on other levels as well.
It is the ending that is the problem.
All of these elements together, make for a classic film that is a MUST SEE for everyone.
A good B-movie cast (Louise Fletcher, Shawn Weatherly, James Hong) and great special effects (for what they must have cost) allow the suspense that is built to sustain til the finish.
Debby is a woman that is desperate to find a man.
This is how we could discreetly influence our young ones ,that values are more important than the pieces of paper , that is cash .
I have stopped expecting originality after the 'jaane bhi do yaaro' days and am being probably a bit too harsh in saying that but I cannot help it as the Hollywood movie scripts copied shamelessly over (well the ones that can be, that is) are usually the movies that i have already seen.
Hence, since last month, i have taken a break and have started watching Korean movies instead..that is till they run out of Hollywood scripts to photocopy.
Not because he likes drag, but because that is what seems to be expected.
The mention of magic in this movie is not really what's it is about, at least that is what i read about the esoteric and magic.
In 2003, in the Longview State Correctional Facility, the criminal Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) that is in the death row is convinced by the cancerous Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) to donate his body to her research and he accepts.
There is a funeral and the movie leads you to believe that that is the end of him.
This is another example of the kind of lifeless writing and lack of imagination that is permeating most of television programming today.
They produced a FREE DVD that is yours for the asking.
And as if that isn't bad enough, the fold system has completely vanished, leaving the ship's crew and the now-rescued inhabitants of the city no alternative but to make their way back home using only conventional engines.
And although the actors hold their own here (for a horror movie that is), something is missing.
As a thriller, it had every element that makes a European-style thriller breathtakingly beautiful, but as a slasher, this visual beauty took away the terror and fun that is usually associated with the genre.
This is a decent episode but also one that is easily forgotten.
Magneto's plan for world domination is actually pretty stupid when you think about it and that is a shame because much of the exposition is very well done.
Whenever a movie is made that is based on comic books, there is always a fear that it can and will be typically pigeonholed into the "comic book film" genre and that the movie is basically made for the fans of that comic book.
The only suspension of disbelief that is required is the assumption that these genetic mutations can happen, and did, causing these extraordinary people.
I'm sorry, but I don't join all the praise that is given here.
What is a blown-up plastic Barbie doll doing in a movie that is situated in the early eighties, when plastic surgery was not even properly born yet??
Manu and his opera singer sister Julie (Julie Depardieu) live modestly in a sleazy hotel cum brothel that is under surveillance by Mehdi.
Ghost Cat has a special charm to it, that is sorely lacking in many movies.
This really is a good piece of film making that is expanding on the Terminator universe.
But that is OK because it was very fun and entertaining.
Five minutes and a crazy gun battle later, this lonely man (Mr. Smith, played by Clive Owen) is protecting a baby that is the target of a group of ruthless assassins headed by the deranged and merciless Hertz (Paul Giamatti).
Magnificent, in a word, not for the dude who is going to sit in the corner and say 'oh look how far fetched that is, look at all that CGI, this is so unrealistic', that is the brilliance of this film it is well and truly rip the crap out of the films which try to hide their CGI scenes with the good old chin wag, this film goes all out action, forget a good old nip to the toilets or a steady stroll to the popcorn stall unless you are still at a dated cinema which has intervals which always spoil the drift of the film because you are sure to miss a key action scene which all the guys you went to the movies with wouldn't stop talking about on the trip home.
Yet a film that is supposed to be adult, Die Hard 4.0, was aimed directly at the kids.
This is a film that is decadent and racy for the sake of it, possibly to have it's pre-pubescent audience snigger at the use of a rude word.
SHOOT 'EM UP is well named: this is a whompingly good action movie that is as much parody of its genre as it is a good story.
But it is the getting there that is all the fun.
There are funny lines, funny situations, and stuff that is so impossible in the real world that you can't help but chuckle.
Goldblum was the only member of the cast I recognized, but that isn't to say the others were bad.
I believe, a reason for such a miss perhaps was using a theme that is a bit too actual.
Well that is carried over here, these guys won't stop until their processor is dead, but since they're CGI for the most part it lessens the feel of real danger... Somewhere deep inside the Terminator fan in me was wishing to return to that dark skull covered gritty landscape we saw glimpses of in the first Terminator (this definitely isn't the future Connor's Mother warned him about)  Hardcore terminator fans might want to avoid this, it was better than T3 but still pretty far off the quality of the first two, still, if its a Summer Blockbuster you want then go see Terminator Salvation, you could do a lot worse...
O.S.B never had one "hokey" episode that would tickle your funny bone and that is what makes for excellent scare tactics.
b) Derek Anderson and Victor Kubicek never find the funding for T5 and are forced to sell it to a studio that is capable of making good decisions to make T5 (ie.
O.S.B never had one "hokey" episode that would tickle your funny bone and that is what makes for excellent scare tactics.
There are several contrivances, and truthfully they were rewriting the script as it was being filmed due to Bale's demands, but all in all (and all things considered), this is an enjoyable film that not only is better on second viewing, but manages to ingratiate itself into the library of Terminator franchise films (or will when it's out on DVD in an unrated, extended director's cut edition, that is).
If characters and situations from many other cartoons can be projected on real people, these are too unreal and not funny, that is the reason for not to watch this cartoon.
Editing is unobtrusive, that is to say that we hear the voices of the slaves undimmed by egotists on the modern end.
Everything about this film irritated me, from the over-used disjointed jump cuts to the ridiculously heavy-handed and out of place piano scoring, and the boring plot (and I hesitate to bestow 'plot' on the disjointed wreck that is Wonderland).
The problem with that is that real life is boring.
This movie has only just come out on DVD in Britain, that is a shamefully long time for a film to reach the country it was made in.
This is no doubt a casualty of the scarlet letter that is the PG-13 rating, oft denied by the production while they dropped subtle hints along the way such as toy deals, Pizza Hut endorsements and McG noting how the PG-13 The Dark Knight was "made without compromise".
Inu Yasha, a creature that is half man, half dog-demon, attempts to steal an enchanted jewel from a shrine, to change himself into a full-blooded demon.
When I was small mostly all my favorite shows were anime and when I grew up and my anime shows all came to an end I started watching shows with people and forgot about anime until Inuyahsa that is.
However, all of that isn't to say that Inuyasha is a bad series.
I only got 2 watch the third one, but it was still really good!I really want everything i can find that is about InuYasha: movies, season DVD sets, toys, collectibles, and anything else i can find that's about InuYasha.I want 2 see the other movies really bad.
The only story arc that is interesting enough to watch is still sort of dull (the band of seven).
Drama and confrontation unfolds in a fairly simple fashion, but the result is a solid effort that is both tense and occasionally funny.
They are given enough humanity to matter, and that is literally everything in this type of film.
In fact, a wide variety of music that is appropriate to the setting is presented here, as opposed to the one-note selections presented in many American films set in prison.
Perhaps the most striking aspect about Carandiru is that it doesn't hit us over the head with its subject matter - at least not initially, that is.
In a sense, that is very true because it is told by the doctor who treated the inmates and thus forged friendships with the criminals.
They are in the awful situation of never having any sunlight, they live in very dark cells, perhaps 7 to a cell that is not much more than 10x20 feet.
The title is a mystery that is referred to a couple of times during the film but its meaning is never made clear.
If only film and theater goers were able to recognize and value substance and depth of character, they would be able to look beyond the shallowness and one dimensional "acting" that is foisted on us.
There are elements of 'Amelie' and the classic Woody Allen comedies such as 'Annie Hall' and 'Manhattan', particularly in Adam Goldberg's neurotic response to the chic scruffiness that is Paris.
Like a cross between something from Woody Allen and Amelie this film has a special naivety full of wonderment juxtaposed with the dark underbelly of life that is at times hard to escape.
Delpy, who wrote, directed, produced and acted in the movie, has made a master work that is complex, evocative, real and quite beautiful.
Myterious Skin is a movie that is perfect in that it captures you in its storytelling and in the end drops its message on you in a very subtle way.
But Neil has a need to trust his in soul-mate, the girl who does everything for him, even gets God on the phone for Neil, just so he can believe in something for one single moment in his life, something that isn't a joke told by his best friend.
Every element of the film is beautiful-the music, the look, the feel, the acting-it all comes together to create a film that is almost like watching a living work of art.
Avalyn takes Brian to see a dead cow, in a scene that is something not to be believed, that holds part of the hidden secret this troubled soul is carrying with him.
The film has a tone that is totally original, bizarre, and dreamily beautiful.
Oh well, that is the world we live in.
There was a genuine quality to his character, an aloofness that comes with knowledge at an early age that is hard to put into words.
Rajskub is so good that she gives the other actors in the film a space to react that is almost visible.
So, that is why I think he jumped off the bridge.
Webster masquerades as Bobo Hutch from Pittsburg, to infiltrate the gang - but in the next scene that is forgotten about.
In a movie like this, that is extremely important.
this is a bad movie that isn't scary.
Finally, someone has made a send-up of 'b' horror movies that is both hysterically funny and scary at the same time.
Equally as significant is the revelation of the killer, which I have to admit was quite clever; I never, ever would have guessed and that is rare for one of these.
Also, the character of Steve has that Ed Wood spirit, the director that is so convinced that his movie is good that can't see the HUGE flaws in it.
And that is the source of delight.
His understated and nuanced interpretation of this complex character contributes a level of patois to the scene that is memorable long after the credits roll.
this show does not give the illusion that as a writer for a weekly column you can afford to stay in the heart of Manhatton (i come from South Africa and i know that is expensive) and afford Jimmy Choo's and Blonicks please, these women work hard to look as good as they do, and in Joan's case you might even make yourself broke trying to maintain the look.
All four of them have different personalities but that is also what makes their bond so strong.
There are plenty of episodes that make me disgusted with this show but there is one episode that is stuck in my mind eternally.
Lestrange finds the castle but behind it is an all girls school that is inhabited by young lovelies.
Entering into this foreign world that is in fact his own, he begins a tour of psychological symbolism and random association, as objects and settings twist and morph around him.
This is most definitely the single best movie that is available out there (however in a close second, check out Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Gene Wilder is astounding).
In this greatly under-rated film, Mike Myers plays a man scared of commitment, until that is he meets Harriet and they fall in love, but does she have a rather macabre secret?
Comics feel to it, but that is The Granny's biggest problem - it only has 20 minutes of entertainment tops.
The violence is so extreme in Bay of Blood that is seems like the director has decided to amplify the most well-known convention of the giallo Â the murders Â to a delirious level.
An impressive film, that is still effective despite its age.
The difference is that "Blood and Black Lace" lacks the theme that is now so popular, with kids being stalked and hunted.
Hatchets get smashed directly into faces, throats get slashed, and all that is shown in explicit detail.
Bay of Blood is often noted as being an obvious inspiration on the Friday the 13th series, and when taking things such as the setting and a certain murder sequence into account, that is certainly true; but let's not forget that this is also a fantastic movie in its own right.
Vince Rocca and crew have accomplished something that is very rare these days, a romantic comedy with balls.
Trust me coming from a cynical bastard like myself that is a HUGE compliment.
This is definitely not one for the kids (that is, unless you're a really irresponsible parent) and it'd probably be best to not let them watch this one.
I think we all want to believe that we could turn back time and maybe find a Shangri-La, even in the far reaches of the American west, and that is what happens to Louis Gates in this movie.
The story was one of those that is predictable, but still interesting to see how they explain where the characters are going to end up.
It's true that the story pushes the limits of credibility, but that is what makes it special .
At least for me that is what this movie is.
Garbo's acting works in movies that consistently maintain a keyed-up romantic tone, but in the stylistic mishmash that is "Grand Hotel," Garbo seems the least real--even to a 1932 audience.
A surprising and entertaining movie that is great thanks to its characters and storytelling, which makes this movie a very good- and interesting one to watch.
People come and goÂ" Well that is just the way the movie is.
If that is your thing, this film is for you.
It does not have gore like other Fulci greats, but it does contain some genuine suspense and nail-biting tension, something that is hardly found in other Fulci movies.
Maybe that is just me, but sometimes it feels like you need to beat around the bush to get to the bass of a situation.
I'll say, this is the only sequel in the entire series that is ACTUALLY scary.
The camera quality is very poor, but this is a low budget movie so that is be expected.
Though Jason himself only appears throughout a very small portion of the movie, this is a very decent sequel and a nice change of pace for the franchise, giving it a good ending (before "Jason X" came along, that is).
The answer to that is: NOTHING!
This twist given to his personality kills the magic that is Friday the 13th a bit, that much is true.
And to have the talent to make the Friday feel, and then deviate from that feel, well that is just despicable.
Rudy Behlmer has an excellent commentary track that is of great value to people who are interested in early Hollywood and Douglas Fairbanks.
In short, a very fine film, of the sort that is impossible to make nowadays.
This often startling account of a progressively S&M tinged love affair (and, yes, that is the right word for it) between an 18 year old schoolgirl and a married man twice her age remains currently banned in its native South Korea where it's considered pornographic.
It is a film about a facet of our lives that is very rarely explored in cinema or talked about in the papers.
We knew nothing about J and Y and that is why Gojitmal failed.
If you're not uptight and can deal with watching thing that you would probably not venture nor wish to do and want to see a filmmaker totally unashamed and unfazed at exploring a genre, then this is a movie that is definitely worth seeing.
The filmmakers had all the right tools to make a decent flick, but in the end, it's missing something that is supposed to make a movie watchable...a decent script.
It follows the formula for a zombie movie, but that is the point.
The first thing that is somewhat dolorous in Dead Heist is that the zombies are nicely introduced while rolling the front credits, but then forgotten for about an hour Â and when they are brought back you'd wish the wait would have been worth it.
This movie is nothing but fun and that is all it was ever meant to be.
However, this is both good and bad, as Cagney does a great Cagney, but he never becomes the person he is supposed to be, that is, the legendary Lon Chaney.
Cagney had become typecast in his gangster roles and wanted to show his other talents and that is exactly what this film does.
Rebel groups called "Snapphanar" is growing up to take the fight against the Swedish troops that is burning their villages and killing their wife's and children.
Ohhh, and for an added bonus the marshals who are supposed to be trained at firing guns can't hit the jackhammer zombie because they are firing at the jackhammer that is just there.
Other than that, this is an amazing film, i would recommend it to anyone looking for something that is not particularly scary but nonetheless highly entertaining.
...to spend a paragraph talking about, that is.
A shootout occurs, one that is so horribly done that it feels like a low grade action film from the 80's.
There is a little gore but that is fine.
Like any other in pop culture, Japan seems always to be very adaptable anything that is "cool", with knowing of meaning of it isn't important.
Agar's love interest is killed when she decides to run under a large stone pillar that is falling.
They find themselves in front of a cavern that isn't natural, or, as Tom puts it, "a perverted UNNATURAL cavern!"
Well, John the Pompous A** shines a flashlight on 'em and melts some elves, because they run away from 'light that is slightly brighter than what [they're] used to, NO!!!'
How John Agar expects to do that is left unexplained -- never mind chunky Nestor Paiva.
Rather he is a multi-dimensional, charismatic, lovable yet ultimately flawed individual caught up in the money-hungry giant that is Hollywood.
Well, until we remember Mecha Streisand that is.
Kekexili follows Ga Yu, a Beijing journalist as he travels with the Mountain Patrol, a civilian group under the command of a man named Ritai who are determined to stop poachers from hunting "chiru", a nearly extinct Tibetan Antelope that is valued for their soft pelts.
Written and directed by Chuan Lu from China and sponsored in part by National Geographic the film was distributed as 'travel/foreign places/environmental issues' product, and while it satisfies those designations, it resonates as a story that is not only based on fact, but one that opens our eyes to another way of life in a very remote area.
One aspect of the film that is unexpected, and demonstrates Lu Chuan's mastery of film making is that you expect to despise the poachers but somehow you end up understanding their plight as much as that of the patrol.
Directed by Phillipe Mora (The Howling Part 2 and Part 3, The Beast Within, Mad Dog Morgan) made an effective psychological drama that is occasionally eerie, suspenseful and even darkly humorous.
And that is precisely what gives this film its impact.
But that is only half the problem.
He has a personality that is difficult to hide behind another persona, but which always adds a little something to it.
This is a well-paced comedy with a context that is never boring to the thoughtful, open-minded viewer
When young black men finally enter the picture (in real life that is, not fantasies) they act nothing like that.
Eugene Byrd plays Khalid (one of the only actors to leave this movie with some dignity) a young black man ready to start law school that is if he can stay out of the trouble the white boyz are looking for.
I'm reading comments here on IMDb like "white boys trying to act like they are black (c'mon that is terrible)" or "can someone say Wigger...".
It walks the very divide that is inherent to any human; the divide we're genetically predisposed to establishing.
I cannot adequately explain the premise without ruining the genius that is this movie, so I can't say much more than that!
Like , OK, there are Huge Human eating Ants, and the people in the movie just say, OK, that is a big ant, and they don't get upset as they or I should be if i was in a situation like that.
I suppose in order to identify this film, I'd have to borrow from America somewhat but that is no shame; this film is 1988's Rain Man meets a hard as nails, gritty revenge film Â perhaps something staring James Cagney in his pomp.
And there is a revelation: the fainting when seeing a dead body female agent is a member of a secret department of agriculture that is so secret even the president doesn't know about it and she is following a lead that has a terrorist ship that had plutonium aboard.
A comedy in three parts, there is a chorus group that is interspersed and opens each story.
The developing love between Jane and Rochester and the enduring nature of that love is the central theme and that is beautifully done.
This is a film that is very much overlooked by most Bogart fans, not because of his acting, but the story line may have been great in 1947, but is not very thrilling today.
The characters really make you hate them, and you feel good about the revenge that is taken upon them.
This is a rather enjoyable movie that is nothing too impressive but is a good watch nevertheless.
Perfectly watchable movie, especially for the Bogart fans, who want to see him in a role that is different.
a great film if you like insane comedy that isn't necessarily complex and extremely thought out.
I cannot say that this story is scary, it is more of a mystery in my book.It is so nice to see a mystery film, that does not have all of the gore that is so prevalent in the film industry today.I give this film a very good rating, and I recommend to all who love mystery and suspense.
Though the setting was on a small scale, (the state of California rather than the entire U.S.) it shows the chaos of what could happen and that is just in California.
Like Arau's original short, the movie's premise is that for strange circumstances all the Hispanic immigrants (not only Mexicans) disappear of the state of California and the state is surrounded by a mysterious fog that isolates the people leaving them without the work that Hispanics usually do.
Nothing in the film feels forced and that is perhaps the highest praise the film and its makers can be given.
I lived in California for 23 years and having Mexican people around is a way of life, they're just other people, they have lives and feelings and YES they do a hell of a lot of the work, so I get the idea behind this film, very well, even though that a lot of the work that is portrayed is work that no one else will do.
Mario Landi's PATRICK STILL LIVES is a weird little film that is weak on pretty much every level - but still manages to be entertaining and pretty fun to watch...  Patrick is the victim of an unfortunate (and kinda hilarious...)accident: while standing by the side of the road, he's randomly hit in the face with a bottle that a passing motorist chucks out of his window, leaving poor Patrick in a coma, but with telekinetic powers (!!??!!)
A erotic masturbation scene that is more arousing than 99.9% of the porn seen today!
Satire that is funny without being vicious, "Coneheads" has a smart observation about everything American from golf to immigration policy.
The punch lines are subtle and innuendo a bit advance for the punch and Judy crowd that is looking for the "Down with society" commentary that seems to fill the comedy of today.
And it makes you stop and think, and that is a pretty amazing thing considering the world we live in.
But right next to that is a movie...I'm sorry, let me rephrase that, a revolution that is "The Texas Nailgun Massacre."
He remained a life-long proponent of a socialist society and economy in which the human values of friendship and community, solidarity and equality, health and environment, culture and enlightenment would hold sway over the commercialization of all aspects of life that is our fate under capitalism.
It's a shame because the film highlights a part of history that is not well known in the western world.
A history that is tied to the 1984 communal riots.
For the first two acts, it seems a black comedy that is heading down a clichÃ©d path toward ignominy.
Religion is dealt with in a mature manner that is a departure from most movies I've seen that have tread in that area.
Arguably the best Bruce Lee documentary available at the moment, and I've pretty much seen every one that is available.
Ramon Novarro did his best work in this film, and the character of Dr. Juttner (played by the wonderful Jean Hersholt) is one that is so likable, that audiences root hard for the characters of Prince Karl and Kathi, whom Dr. Juttner supports.
There is a love triangle that is quite poignant.
It's a good little movie to watch in the middle of the night (which is when I watched it) and certainly one that is worth a repeat viewing.
And in this case, the differences give it an edge that is quite intriguing.
Third, it brings to focus, an era of vaudeville entertainment, that is no longer with us, so that we can only get a glimpse of what this was like from recreations and documentaries like this.
Altogether, a film that is a must-watch for all lovers of classic cinema.
That is unfortunate, because that is it's only major fault.
This is a terrific film to show your children, a behind the scenes that is informative rather than salacious or snarky.
Some of the photography was magnificent and many cinematographers think that is the medium in which they could really show off their talents.
You need looks and money to get into these organizations at Talbot and sometimes even that is not enough.
But if you are really hoping for a lost season that is authentic, then you better keep waiting.
Jeeze Barney the Dinosour is better then this and that is a shame!
This type of comedy is not for everyone and that is why some people feels this comes off as quirky.
Yet, I really think that the film really makes us realize that who shouldn't judge one by looks, but the sad fact about that is true.
After all, it was on the Lifetime channel and that is an often-used theme.
I say pseudo under the definition of pseudo-event--I think that is Boreman?
Present day 1986 that is.
The film may based on real experiences of writer/director Noah Baumbach, but it could be about any family alienated by a society that is at once trying to lead them in a direction while neglecting them on the process of coping with the journey.
Jeff Daniels and Laura Linney play parents divided by pressure and growing contempt in a manner that is, quite seriously, Oscar-worthy.
Watch it to see how this movie shows how the children cope, find out who to blame, and bear through a tough time in their young lives that is happening more and more often.
Writer-director Noah Baumbach has crafted a film that is equal parts uproarious humor and personal anguish.
And the actors are in fine form: Daniels' Bernard is the epitome of a once-successful author in flux, looking to an adventurous student (Anna Paquin) to kick-start his faded sex drive; Linney's Joan is a blend of loose morals and regret; Eisenberg fuses the clunky transition to adulthood with anxiety over his identity ("Don't be difficult," he says in lockstep with his father); and Kline's foul-mouthed, alcohol-drinking, semen-spreading Frank displays the type of growing-up experience that is seldom touched in mainstream cinema.
The rest of the film is filled with Walt's blatant plagiarism, a non-stop stream of offensive cursing, arguments, premature ejaculation, Bernard allowing his dinner guests at restaurants to only order half-orders because he's so cheap, unbelievable therapy sessions, Bernard trying to force his female student and border to perform oral sex only to be interrupted by his son, and a medical emergency that is offered as redemption but fails.
Please, not only do I always question movies that use the title as a line in the film that is "really important" to the story but to have something as petty and unemotional as a character looking at a science sculpture!
Anna Paquin is good as Lili, Bernard's student that is wiser than her young years indicate.
How can he play a character that is not on the screen?
This heroic story is about a single mother with four kids that is threatened with a brain tumor and survives a dangerous operation and side effects only to lose her youngest child in the Columbine High School Massacre.
If this movie teaches anything, that is that even when the fates deal a cruel blow (or two), the nature of a woman, a mother, a fighter, is to never give up.
The title implies that this will be a 'confessional' drama and implies that the central character is a prostitute, though that is somewhat misleading.
And one that is very well done.
Coco's flatulence, the out-of-camera lines ("that is NOT her color!
At some points in this movie, that is exactly what he did.
I've had a copy of this film for a long while but I've continually put off watching it, and the reason for that is simply down to the running time; 127 minutes is far, far too long for a silly and trashy Jaws rip off.
The film really does drag far too often, and that's really not what you want from a film that is supposed to be fun.
The film is somewhat notorious for its animal killing scenes and that's hardly surprising because plenty of fish get butchered and it's not nice viewing - worse than Cannibal Holocaust, that is for sure!
Very much, that is!
The Cinematography by Peter Biziou is excellent and the acting by Gene hackman and Willem Dafoe is great.Not perfect but very entertaining and the film has a good story that is inspired by real-life events.4/5
never underestimate the ability of hackman and dafoe... that is the only thing that i can say.... we have seen a lot of movie involving hackman, and this is one of the greatest performance from him...don't ever judge the acting by comparing to his age..he will always be one of the greatest actor for all time...Willem dafoe is just like the underdog...sometimes he has given a very powerful acting in a movie,and it was proved by two movies...this one @ Mississippi burning..and American psycho..  thus to these performances...hackman was nominated for Oscar...he really deserves it !!
There is a small scene in Mississippi Burning that is just as powerful as any Gene Hackman speech or any violent montage to gospel music that is in this film.
But that is besides the point, the point being that this film is mesmerizing.
There is however one actor in particular that I wanted to touch on and that is Michael Rooker.
But not just because three boys were murdered, but because no one knows why they were murdered,besides racism that is.
I thought the acting was very very good (Paul Mccloskey and Barbra Lessin were very very realistic), the movie has plenty of blood and gore, lots of disturbing moments, and a surprising ending that is also atypical of a horror movie.
The film is not your conventional horror movie, but that is what makes it so scary.
The lighting, camera work and acting all support the home movie style that is the centerpiece of the movie.
It's easy on the eyes but it's the only thing that is.
The only elements of colour and light in his life are those in which his wife 'Shalini is a part of (that is, in the song and... actually in the film itself!
For a movie that is about ghosts, lost souls, and haunted houses where things go "bump", there sure is a severe lack of atmosphere.
is a consistent and entertaining movie that is sadly little-know and/or long forgotten in modern days, which is really too bad because this is an excellent film.
is an excellent late '60s horror/thriller that is definitely worth seeing.
There are plenty of long,slow and silent moments where the movie is maybe testing more pedestrian audiences to see if they can hang with a film that is relatively low in action and where the suspense is mostly implied until the last quarter of the film.
But there's a hitch, and that is that John's young, fast and loose daughter named Julie (Sagnier) frequents it rather often thus causing friction, disagreement and general strife.
One scene that is quite telling of where reality stops and her inspiration starts is that of Franck-the local waiter, cleaning leaves from the pool with the net, wearing a tiny bathing suit, before he stands over the sunbathing, sleeping "Julie".
He doesn't work at the villa cleaning the pool-that is old Marcel's job.
Makers of erotic thrillers need to be careful, as that is a genre that, if not handled carefully, can quickly fall prey to silliness and excess (think "Fatal Attraction").
It's the story of a love that is fulfilled.
My only wish is that is would be shown on the big screen more often.
Nothing transpires that is even remotely cool.
that is the overall theme of the unsung hero in this movie.
If you decide to take these zany proceedings seriously, that is your choice, but approached in the right state of mind, it's often hilarious.
Sadly the main fault in this film lies in its story that is a poor mish mash of poor D grade bollywood storylines, it has everything thrown in... murder, revenge love, action and of course the hoards of bikini clad women who really serve no purpose at all.
Smartly produced, it's a well-written story that is reminiscent of American teen films from the 80's.
It is the harsh reality that is nature.
Of course that is unrealistic.
It was very sad when Flower died but that is a part of nature and it is no-one's fault not even the Researchers, that was the saddest episode of the whole series.
Add in Arbuckle's casual gags and the result is an excellent comedy that is still highly watchable -- except, of course, when you are trying to make sense of real-life nephew Al St. John's awful mugging and high-speed rowdyism.
Although a low-budget programmer that is only 67 minutes long and was no doubt made in a few weeks, PIER 5, HAVANA provides good, honest, hard-boiled entertainment and plays like a good 1950s detective TV show.
The only good moment in this movie comes after about 10 minutes: a fake cereal commercial that is actually quite funny.
If you really want to see Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in one of their funniest movies of their early 1940's years, then I really recommend that you see this funny movie, you will be laughing as Abbott and Costello getting into a lot of trouble, but then again, that is just typical for Abbott and Costello, everywhere they go, they always manage to get into trouble!
However, there is one role and one performance in this film that makes it an absolute must for at least one viewing, and that is the hilariously funny, and PERFECTLY executed comedy of Dame Sybil Thorndike, who plays the role of a South Slavic Queen Dowager who is "a little vague"--as Marilyn Monroe, in the role of Elsie Marina says after meeting her, "a LITTLE vague?!"
Another subtlety that is often overlooked is Northbrook's initial apprehension at accepting the job of being the liaison with this royal family, at the same time he is obviously, explicitly, attracted to the regent in a way you would not expect to find in a movie of this era.
And it is the Balkans that is the spot that Laurence Olivier's Carpathia is located in.
She carries off an eccentric royal type that is light years away from her aged, vicious crone in BRITTANIA MEWS.
The potential viewer then expects to see a campy grossout, but that is not what happens at all.
It's not great, but it does have a clever spark that is unusual for a supercheap indy.
This is a tightly plotted story that is an excellent rental!
"The Mayans were presented as savages" - that is because they were(check out their rituals), or what is your definition of a savage?There is another moment in the film:the bad guy threatens Jaguar Paw he would skin him alive and then wear his skin.I first thought, well that was original of Gibson, but then I found out on the internet that skinning your enemies and wearing their skin was an ACTUAL RITUAL of the Mayans.Yes they were savages, and I don't care how many Mexicans(who think they are the legacy of the Mayans, which they are not) feel offended by this movie.
From the trailers one is intrigued and thats what has really wanted me to go and check it out further, Mel Gibson does a masterful job of doing research on the life , times and languages of the Mayan culture (how historically accurate it actually is, that is debatable).
It is so nice to have a show to watch that isn't so drearily predictable - you never know what Flower, Mozart, Tosca and company will be up to or up against next.
But I really will never know because if he is in fact making a point such as the one I have guessed at in 3., he fails in his utter vagueness and leaves us with a film that is ultimately disappointing, if not entirely offensive!
Mel Gibson obviously has some major demons but maybe that is what makes him such a masterful storyteller.Apocalypto is his latest and IMO his greatest film, this film plays out like the bastard freak brother of the Fugitive, it is wildly entertaining and violently sick, it also is an allegory of todays society.The images in this film are breathtaking, shot with the genesis digital cameras this is the best looking digital film out to date, the cinematography is superb, the costumes,make up and art direction are top notch.The acting is a real surprise since Gibson casted actors with no experience at all, yet they are convincing.What Mel Gibson has directed here is like an ultra violent yet very entertaining action/adventure chase film, the best one in years, this is a must see, and for people worrying about subtitles, do not worry, they are simple and brisk.
Jennings' monologues are what make this a true 60's sick-flick, as he compares women with everything that is filthy, unreliable and scum.
This is a film that is recommendable to my fellow fans of cult-sleaze for a pioneering character.
There are a handful of other fine performances, and Giuseppe Rotunno uses a palette of colors that is a study in itself.
Perhaps that is the key, referring to the root of the poisonous plant found in the chic ultra-fab Malibu seaside manse's garden which, in the long run (spoilers begin here) acts as a deus ex machina at the end the movie.
One of my film buff chums went way out on a wine-driven limb about how it was about the Reality of Cyberspace and all kinds of flapdoodle about melding karmas in chat rooms or some such stuff that is posited by the Sarsgaard character early in the film.
The photography was superb and I would love to live in the house that is all through the movie.
He's written this fantastic, beautiful, evocative story that is based on his own life experience: a love story between two men that ends in the death of one of them, titled "The Dying Gaul."
DVD UPDATE: the video release offers an alternate ending that is far superior to the theatrical release.
There is nothing about this story that is compelling to me.
THE DYING GAUL is a tough film but one that is so refreshingly dedicated to its vision that it scores as a major work.
This takes you into the heart of a different part of the world where freedom is not something that is taken for granted.
This has got to be without a doubt a major major movie that is overlooked.
This cannot come from outside, especially not from the US that is no model, neither social nor economic nor even political, but it has to come from inside, from deep down in the souls, the minds and the spirits of the Chinese.
The very point we are confronted to with China is that it is one fourth of humanity or so and no one has any interest in a brutal and uncontrolled change in a direction that is not carried and supported by the heritage of the country, its history, its culture.
And if you're going to write a film with a female protagonist, give us a character that is written as a person and not as a guy's idea of what a girl is/should be.
The direction is generally excellent and the writers showed that they could make an intelligent and well-constructed film that is timeless.
This film has such a delightful casualness and yet is strongly plotted and has superb performances and full of ideas and technique that is decades before Quentin T and co.  And anyone who can get me Claude Lelouch's email id or contact address....i'd be very grateful.
And that is what partly makes "Fortress" quite a fun watch despite its many limitations.
By coupling an interesting plot with somewhat decent acting, Fortress deserves at least a saturday afternoon rental, that is if nothing more exciting is going on.
Christopher Lambert stars as a man in the near future and his wife is pregnant for the 2nd time but that is illegal because of a population control and they are trying to escape to Mexico but they get caught and sent to a maximum security futuristic prison called the Fortress for 31 years.It is said that it is imposable to escape from this prison but against all the odds Christopher Lamberts character plans to escape from the prison with his wife and some of his friends.
They are caught trying to cross the border and sent to a maximum security prison that is owned and run by the "MenTel Corporation" A place where dreams are not your own and all thoughts of escape are dealt with severely by futuristic methods unheard of in the civilised world.
Look it is a little cheezy, but that is Gordon's style.
There are scenes where a boy mysteriously reappears on a rope that is hanging in mid air, a giant scorpion attacks the thief as he searches for the lost treasure, and a magic carpet flies over the city of Baghdad.
There is one section on this DVD that is poor quality, compared to the others.
All that is thrown asunder when Mr. Fairbanks lays his eyes on veiled, but pretty Julanne Johnson (as "The Princess").
He is a real scoundrel and not particularly likable,...that is, until he meets the woman of his dreams, the princess.
There is one section on this DVD that is poor quality, compared to the others.
There is none in the kingdom wily & cunning enough to thwart the evil one's wicked plots - no one, that is, except THE THIEF OF BAGDAD.
New episodes that is.
I take funny over bitter myself, but that is why this show like many situation comedies put a little realty in, but still were living in a never-never land.
My parents knew ALL of them and maybe that is what influenced them the most about this show - where it did nothing for me.
Dreadful, dreadful mess of a moovie that is as un-scary and un-funny as they come, sort of like Police Academy meets Fright Night.
The whole idea of it was dumb, and I think made for men, and that isn't fair to us female fans of Tales From The Crypt... am I missing something?
I would also say that it captures the same style from the Manga (comic books) that is very funny and romantic.
Jarmusch's humor gets a bit cynic if he chooses exactly Paolo Bonacelli for the role of the priest who dies in the taxi under the "confession" of Roberto Benigni: the same Bonacelli who was in one of the three leading roles in Pasolini's "Salo", a movie that is so full with nausea that people can hardly survive it.
The characters often speak with a much more modern speech pattern (see, for instance, Unferth's first confrontation with Beowulf, where he comes off as much more smarmy than in the poem) that is jarring to the ear and that often seems to lead, yet again, into Gaiman and Avary's unspoken goal of de-heroizing, de-mythologizing, and de-bunking the poem.
(Cain, the first murderer, who is claimed to be the ancestor of Grendel's kind, not "Cain," the not-appearing-in-the-poem whipping boy of Unferth's, that is.)
Recommended to anyone that wants to see a quirky film that is also very funny.
There are excellent performances from great talents like Rosie Perez and Wynona Ryder, and a wonderful early glimpse of Roberto Benigni as the very explicit Italian taxi cabdriver in a scene that is absolutely hilarious.
In fact, it's ironic because the only cast member that doesn't pull her weight is the only one that isn't unknown - Winona Ryder.
The reason is simple: Is original, yes this film is one of the most originals films in a lot of years, the five stories, the five different cities and is all only in one night, for me that is awesome and excellent because Jarmusch is the only filmmaker that could do that.
We glimpse A side of the world that is the same no matter where you go.
just got my 2 disc anthropophagus DVD in the mail the other day put out by those awesome folks at shriek show.this movie could have used a couple more gory killing in it but i'm not going to complain to much and what there is for gore in this Italian classic is pretty bloody and gory.george eastman is perfectly cast as the mad cannibal who stalks a boatload of tourists on an island.i am a huge fan of joe d'amato so when this came out i threw my old bootleg in the garbage.disc two has a sixty seven minute documentary and interview with d'amato so just that is reason enough to buy this DVD..so if you are a fan of gory and cheesy Italian horror buy this right away
"Antropophagus" is really no exception to this all but has as a big difference that it's really well developed and build up, which provides the movie with a great horror atmosphere that is both tense and gory, despite being predictable from start till finish.
The movie is also helped by it's killer, that is a great character, who is also quite scary looking.
The so called famous fetus eating scene is about the only thing that could atract anyone to watch this film and even that is poorly done.
It could be considered somewhat boring the first part of the movie, but the only time I think of that is when I watch it with friends, and they say "isn't anything going to happen?
Unless you're impatient with older films, this is one that is worth your time and I can see myself seeing it again and again if the opportunity presents itself.
There is simply no point in watching cut versions of Exploitation-King Joe D'Amato's movies, and "Antropophagus" in particular is a movie that is intended to shock, so the uncut version is essential.
The DVD has an alternate ending that is really trippy, too.
The plot is a romantic comedy that is not a formula.
They are all involved in a sudden event that is life changing for them all.
Please bring it back, and cure the horrible curiosity that is making many teens and fans of the show, wonder and yearn for answers.
Is it wise to fire a gun onboard a spaceship while you're surrounded by all kinds of machinery that is keeping you alive?
As if that isn't bad enough, a videotaped Laura San Giacomo rocks back and forth spouting Shakespeare.
The film takes place during approximately a day and half in the lives of two italian brothers who run a restaurant in New Jersey that is less than successful.
Their competition, Pascal, has a restaurant down the street that is thriving, despite the fact that the food doesn't compare to the brothers' restaurant.
The viewer is left to speculate, something that is a rarity in american films, even with a lot of independents.
Two brothers, immigrants from Italy, run Il Paradiso, a restaurant that is about to go under after two years.
But that is not where the impact of the denouement lies, and there is no neat Hollywood-style resolution at the end, just an affirmation of the two brothers' love for each other and their dedication to good cuisine.
Perhaps that is why Bunuel used two women to play the same part.
Tony Shalhoub & Stanley Tucci (one of the two directors,and who also co-wrote the screenplay with Joseph Tropiano)play the two brothers who try to keep the leaky boat that is their beloved restaurant afloat.
Scott and Tucci have created a wonderful blend of food and love and its the relationship between the two brothers that is the key here.
Really, the whole thing is just so far fetched, yet that is the film's great achievement because when you watch it, you actually believe it (at least I did!)
There's also MacKenzie's bread & butter as he tries to finance his pet project, Salome (the film Jackson and his team are sort of after in present-day), which are the random silent comedies of Stan the Man (Peter Corrigan in hilarious make-up), who goes about hitting people un-suspecting pies, as he figures that attacks that are on the innocent (which happens after he strikes a child in one of his early comedies) could work well, that is, until the Prime Minister is on the scene.
It teaches you to take everything in film and television that is supposedly 'real', with a big grain of salt.
From then on we treated the whole thing as a lark and just revelled in the imagination that is Peter Jackson's trade mark.
The game-play is entertaining, and that is an(but not the only one) aspect where this really lives up to the first(and at times surpasses it... although there are parts of this that are surpassed by the first).
Not all from the first game return, but I'm not sure there's a single FPS armory need that isn't covered.
This is probably one of his most beguiling movies, one that is foundationally built on characters that are contradictions of themselves.
Sometimes you see a movie that opens a door into a fascinating topic, into subject matter that is completely new and original, and that was the case when I first saw "Flags of Our Fathers".
Hard to believe that is the point, but that fits as well, or better, with the film than some of these other views.
Again, hard to believe that is the point, but that fits as well, or better, with the film than some of these other views.
Rarely does the term "instant classic" apply, but Eastwood has surpassed his work on "Unforgiven," "Mystic River," and "Million Dollar Baby," and he has created a film that is nearly certain to endure and stand the test of time.
While watching Flags of our Fathers, there are a few scenes that you can imagine being in the next years release and maybe that is where Eastwood and the gang lost their focus.
The film tells three stories: first it is the WW II battle of Iwo Jima where thousands of soldiers (Japanese and American) died 'conquering' that island.
Second is the story of a son of one of the flag raisers on that island, who interviews other survivors of that battle to understand his dad a little better.
And that is true in this case, but not before Jet takes a good beating.
An early scene with a man being literally blown in half by a grenade let's us know that isn't a family-friendly Jackie Chan film.
The story is quite thin, but that is usually the catch with this kind of movies.
This is an excellent Jet Li film, that is really intense, with lots of great action, and fantastic performances!.
This is an excellent Jet Li Film that is really intense, with lots of great action, and fantastic performances!.
Duty, honor, something that is a natural for the monarchy of that country, was a burden Edward was not ready to accept because it excluded the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson, who he fell in love with and put him at odds with his family and the English establishment, something unheard of in those days.
There is some hint towards the end of the narrative, of the sadness of the life of exile that the Windsors led, but that is a whole other movie.
The only other thing I can think of off the top of my head that is actually better than this extremely original story-driven movie is Armen and Bullik (quite possibly the best TV show ever).
Perhaps that is why it has not received its due rewards.
I love Cary Grant and he does a pretty good job here playing a character that is not completely sympathetic.
Director Stuart Walker helms this unabashedly grim WWI drama with tact and honesty, featuring some above average aerial footage and an unflinchingly blatant anti-war message that is still quite surprising and daring for a depression-era studio film.
Perhaps a bit too a head of it's time when originally released, THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK is a terrific film that is ripe for rediscovery.
A very touching story that is a guilty pleasure to watch.
I wonder if Orwell (if he were still alive that is) would be happy to find that one of his character's names is used as the title for such an excuse for a show, I think not!
If there was ever any iron-clad proof that Britain is the most uncultured and TV-addicted society in the world then the dredge that is Big Brother is it.
It's a movie that is worth the watch while.
What hath Cain (James M., that is) wrought?
If you're looking for a GOOD horror movie that is suspenseful and scary, you've come to the wrong place.
A serial killer causes citizens of a small town fearful of opening their front doors...that is where he nails some of his victims.
The retired detective Mike (Antonio Mastrantonio), who is the absent grandfather that is trying to approach to his granddaughter Nikki Reynolds (Joli Julianna), teams up with the inexperienced Detective Billie Vega (Kim Taggart) to help her in her investigation, where the slow janitor Troy (Sal Sirchia) is the prime suspect.
OK I'm awarding this a 4..... And that is purely because 2 scenes in the entire film were well done, turned up the gore and feeling of real gut wrenching revulsion and just about saved the film from a Zero.
Told by the caller a fact that is not known to the public about the crime Malcolm as well as the police officials Ray Martinez & Phil Wilson, Andy Garcia & Richard Bradford, that he got in touch with who were on the case realize that the caller is the real McCoy and begin to tape Malcolm's phone at the newspaper to identify and capture the killer.
although I'm not quite sure what that is.Buckaroo is odd.
A movie that is easy to watch, funny and fun and still allows so many big names a little early days fun.
As Lizardo/Whorfin, John Lithgow takes it magnificently over the top with a character that is something of a precursor to his High Commander Dick Solomon on TV's `3rd Rock from the Sun.'
Ellen Barkin is particularly fetching as Penny Priddy, while Jeff Goldblum stakes out his turf with an engaging feverishness that is all his own.
They also call in another scientist that is supposed to be a little crazy.
It's "breed specific" but that is just what it's about.
Galibin truly brings out his talent in this role - the role that is not a very playable one as the character does not go through much action or much visible change.
was the title of DC Thompson's Dandy comic that is seen next to a copy of his own book, and for some reason it's that image that has always stayed with me since '81.
I wanted to at least like this movie, but there is so much here that is truly awful and/or stupid.
By the end of the movie, Chad Donella is forced to choose between an ex-model with a innocent personality, and a Once overweight girl with low self esteem, and a personality that is just as sweet the model, only not as accommodating to rejection.
I'm sorry I couldn't give it less than a 1, because that is overrating it considerably.
Again not due to "accuracy" or inaccuracy, as that is impossible to do with certain films but with the originality and what i thought was quality film making.
A pot-boiler of a Film that is intelligently crafted by Director Robert Parrish.
To some it may seem intolerably slow & lacking pace, but to others like myself the Film does something that nearly all Films in the Fifties and indeed many now do not even attempt to achieve, and that is take the time to investigate the main characters in depth and in detail.
It all gets mixed up together, and homophobia damps down any positive emotions between men that isn't associated with some sport.
Francis Ford Coppola creates a lovely 40's style that is pleasing to the eye and gives the film a very upbeat attitude.
It's easy to believe that the man who pioneered all these safety features, Preston Tucker, would be a man of heart, and that is how he is portrayed here.
In fact that is what this movie is; a film with heart.
It's an intense scene, one that is full of a "oh no!"
This film is offensive, but that isn't the problem.
The audience is suddenly asked to feel bad for these rather idiotic characters (I'm using that term loosely), but instead we really feel nothing, and that is what makes this movie so disgusting.
The incredible directing that is prominent in 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is evident here.
If this and "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" is all she did, that is enough to make me jealous.
There is very little major that is changed or removed from the story.
It is a very rare experience and that is another reason why I absolutely appreciate this movie!!!
Bill Clinton's philandering and the endless public spectacle that is the British Royals just seem so incredibly dull and tame compared with the bad behavior of Augustus' clan.
There are simply not enough superlatives in the English language to express my opinion of the towering triumph that is `I, Claudius'.
"A Return to Salem's Lot" by Larry Cohen is not as bad as it's reputed to be.In fact I used to watch it pretty often when I was a kid.Of course it's not as scary or suspenseful as Tobe Hooper's "Salem's Lot",but it still manages to entertain if you are in the right mood.The acting is terrible as is the make-up of the vampires,but there is enough amusing moments to make the viewer smile.Samuel Fuller is quite memorable as a Vampire slayer.Overall,"A Return to Salem's Lot" is a quirky,occasionally uneven horror film that is worth a look for fans of Larry Cohen's unusual horror movies.7 out of 10 and that's being kind.
The only thing that connects this to the first film is the title and setting, anything after that is Cohen's own creation.
Crummy horror sequel that is barely connected to the original but manages to be just as bad.
This movie had a good idea, that is, how a colony of vampires might live, what they do to survive, etc.
There was nothing left of the town at the end of the last film, and suddenly all new characters are coming home to a place that isn't even supposed to exist.
It is interesting how each encounter is a small relationship that is crafted by the Woman.
A low budget film that is an intimate and soul searching drama.
Now that is something to laugh at, not the lame jokes.
Name a slasher since the big three that has added anything new to this genre...more graphic gore is not setting a trend...blair witch was absolutely a yawner...and i am guessing the same people yapping at this movie loved Blair Witch...what an awesome idea treating it as behind the scenes documentary for the first half...sure it was predictable....name a slasher or any other movie for that matter that isn't...sure there were movies that have shocked us but they are few and far between...as to protecting people...relax those protector's also love the nanny state and probably need people to protect them from things like horrible flicks.
I don't think i've ever seen a movie that is this sad..
And then he just ends up killing everybody, all the guys filming, too, because they decide to stop him, apart from the girl, of course, that is one of the two, i guess, main characters in the movie.
In particular, Zelda "Everyone must cross over" Rubinstein provides a terrible performance that is almost distracting enough to have made me turn the movie off: her one scene, based on how the director keeps cutting away, I think they must have been feeding her lines one by one.
), but that is the heart of the movie's charm.
Overall, though this is a very entertaining mockumentary/slasher that is a must have for any slasher fan or any horror fan in general.
There's a twist during the climax that is pulled off quite humorously.
I love the ballroom scene, where Betty/Cinderella and The Prince dance (until midnight that is).
Beyond that is the typical B-movie stuff: bad acting, cheesy special effects (the "alien" is a man in body armor and a mask) and laughable dialog.
And that is the quality that I found most appealing and more like real life.
The Fleischer style, in the long form, spins a bouncy Hollywood-ized yarn that is every kid's dream: To be bigger than all the adults and have them all in awe of you.
If pressed, I would describe "Gulliver's Travels" as a love story - a love story with singularly uninvolving protagonists and a good deal of excess "incident" - that is, padding.
There is no story, just one scene after another that is comprised of the Dead Girl looking for more idiotic victims and tons of shots comprised of the boring French provinces shown in wide angles, including a lackluster French band playing corny music.
Emergency(1972) that is the Year i was born that's why i love Emergency and engine 51 because i love the engine 51 and Fire Engine 51 also.
He has a unique world view and holds a special place in the world of "fantastique" cinema that is indisputable.
I would much rather watch reruns of this show on the DVDs than most of the garbage that is on the tube now!
If I have one complaint about the show, it would be the lack money spent on many of the special effects, but that is understandable considering the budgets for TV shows at the time.
The Rose is a character that is impossible to admire.
Bette Midler offers a performance that is both powerful (for the actress) and troubling (for the character.)
Ponderous handling of the material by Rydell but with Midler's gut wrenching performance it becomes a film that is ultimately unforgettable.
The premise: a group of mix-mashed crossrefrences of modern day life are Stranded deadlocked on a Island that is not on any maps and not a soul even knows that it is here... Now all of them, not only have to traverse the mystery of just who each of them actually are, but before it is too late they must Figure the right way through the Unknown Depths of an Island in which the Nightmarish truths are about to be unearthed on a Island known only as "MK:NAOMI"  excerpt: a gov cover-up a Experiment Island in which Failed Experiment Plague the Traditional Loin cloth wearing Inhabitintes have to overcome If you sleep.... hope you have a happy dream Pray Hard it is not a scary one or you might think it really is real really ... cause on this island your nightmares are reality oh and one other thing be careful what you eat oh and think before you open the door...or like the Hero you could be a little green under the gills ...wait hell ya might have gills ... in fact this show was so good i remembered it and thought LOST was the culmination of it coming back...OH well...

He allows himself to become a more marginal figure in some sequences Â for example when Spike Duggan is knocking out one challenger after another, Charlie isn't doing very much, and is off-screen half the time, but it's his reactions to the growing number of defeated men that is funny.
Charlie walks with his bulldog and finds a "good luck" horseshoe when he passes a training camp that is looking for a boxing partner "who can take a beating".Charlie won't take a beating, that he has decided.After watching the others lose, he puts the horseshoe inside his glove and wins.Now the trainer prepares Charlie to fight the world champion.Can Charlie win this time.There's also a nasty gambler who wants him to throw the fight.And there's also some love in the air with the trainer's daughter.What a great silent short from Charles Chaplin.The Champion is from 1915 and it also stars Edna Purviance (Trainer's Daughter), Ernest Van Pelt (Spike Dugan), Lloyd Bacon (Second Sparring Partner etc.)
Certainly this show is a huge improvement on much of the drek that is currently on TV so I'll keep watching it as long as they don't mess it up or cancel it.
Flash also shows some restraint regarding sexually suggestive stuff that would largely sail over kids' heads, and violence that isn't too disturbing - how refreshing that they kept a story that was originally innocent & intended for children...suitable for children.
I like Flash Gordon because it doesn't take itself seriously, and that is what makes it enjoyable.
"Agent Under Fire" is the first (to my knowledge) James Bond game that isn't based on one of the movies.
Between the bad acting and the poor writing, it is impossible to find a character that isn't boring, or even likable.
Her role here is fairly straightforward, but she plays it so well, and with such facility, that it's the kind of performance that is easily and too often overlooked.
This is the best prison comedy ever in my opinion if that is saying much.
For a film that is suppose to be a black comedy the one glaring omission is humor.
There is something about French films that is truly unique and this one is a perfect example of French film at its best - although I cannot think of any French film I did not like.
And since that isn't the plot point that the movie hinges on, it doesn't feel like it matters in the end.
And that is what makes the show special.
It's a film about making statements and Peter Berlin's happens to deal with his self-image and part of that is his sexuality.
I had thought "Frogs" would be one of those campy movies that is enjoyable in its badness...
Ray Milland, Sam Elliot, Joan Van Ark, Adam Roarke and Judy Pace are all realistic in their performances as the family, and overall, this is just a fun film that is worth watching over and over again.
Perhaps even some viewers will be envious of the graceful and experienced Hong character, and I think that is part of the point.
There is complexity of the story, fish kills, radiation and a sense that this is a larger problem, that is lacking from most American films of the time period and the genre.
Let me quickly begin by putting to rest once and for all a terrible error that is popping up everywhere concerning this film: THE GIANT BEHEMOTH was not, repeat NOT, "co-directed" by Mr Douglas Hickox.
S. J. Perelman, on whose play this is based, would sometimes use the nom de plume Sidney Namelrep, a silly, devil-may-care joke that is perfectly in tune with his sense of humor.
Ironically, Lee Van Cleef, who played Angel Eyes in the Good the Bad and the Ugly, plays a role that is equally antagonistic towards Snake in Escape from NY.
Some of the scenes in this movie are terrific such as Snake eluding the Crazies, Snake finds Brain (Harry Dean Stanton), an old friend of his who betrayed him in a robbery, and the car chase across the 69th Street bridge that is mined.
I think that all previous cinematic efforts all the way back to Thomas Edison were just a build-up for this triumphant moment, a seething maelstrom of cheese that vaporizes the very soul of the viewer, leaving nothing but a listless, nihilistic shell waiting for death, as any subjective experience past this point has no meaning; it is completely annihilated by the revelation of film greatness that is Escape From New York.  
And with the participation of Lee Van Cleef (The Good, the bad and the ugly), Isaac Hayes as "The Duke" and the great Harry Dean Stanton (Paris Texas) as "Brain" makes this as a amazing cast that is the perfect complement for the great story of Carpenter.
Conclusion: i highly recommend this cult classic and you must know that "Snake" is not dead, prove to that is that 26 years later he is still one of the best characters ever.
PS: i hear that is coming a remake of this film, i hope this respect the essence of the original and at least Carpenter will be the producer.
In case you are wondering if that is a good or a bad thing: I liked those movies and yes I like this one as well.
It really gets your adrenaline going, and that is one of the most important factors of movies.
It is a film that is to Wales what Trainspotting is to Scotland but that is really where the similarities end.
The truth of the matter is that Anne has a very unique personality and one that is captivating for others to watch.
This is a fine movie - certainly the mst successful and wellknown og the new danish movies (that is within Denmark).
I read that someone thought it to be racist... Hornestly that is just BS - and by the way DF only had about 15% of the votes at the last election and although many people want it to be racist it really isn't.
So it must be a question of very different types of black humor if Albanians have any (black humor that is), Danish humor often is more black and morbid than British humor, which I normally consider the unofficial world champions of black humor   Cheers Bo  I have nothing more to say, but there is a minimum of 10 lines, which I think is a lot, I mean not everybody has that much to say!
I cannot believe I never noticed that before, that is hilarious.
A great film with a fairly simple plot that is great to watch if you are trying to learn German but also great for anyone who really loves foreign films.
RGV must be praised those days for trying something new  One such adventure which was latter tried by others is DARNA MANA HAI(03) of having multiple stories in 1 film  The film however falls short of expectations though it's novel  The different stories are:  Sohail- Antra Bad and boring Acting- Sohail has nothing to do, Antra is okay  Sanjay- Shilpa This story lacks logic which can be ignored but the treatment could be better, especially the portions showing characters making weird faces while eating apples is too much Yet a decent story Shilpa acts very well while Sanjay is okay Rajpal leaves a mark  Vivek- Nana this is the best story and handled very well though it doesn't make much sense and they are flaws but that is forgiven The story makes for an edge of a seat story Acting wise Nana is brilliant as usual while Vivek too does a great job  Aftab- Isha This story which was latter made as GAYAB(03) has it's moments and the scenes involving Aftab and his power is well handled The culmination too is good but some people may not agree with the story Acting- Aftab is very good and Isha is okay  Saif- Boman This story is implausible but entertaining and well handled though flimsy Acting Boman and Saif are superb   Raghuvir Yadav This story is well handled too Acting- Raghuvir Yadav excels  The worst part of the film is the main story which appears too bad and the scenes involving the college friends are badly handled and the culmination of the film too is horrible  Amongst rest Sameera is okay, Gaurav leaves a mark Sushant is okay
Sure, it is very stupid, but this is that kind of movie that is so stupid, it's already funny again.
But that is exactly what they were supposed to be!
The power of the media is so huge, and it is such a refreshing change to enjoy a movie that is interesting, well made and inspiring on so many levels all at the same time.
At least that is my impression via this film.
To salvage the mess this planet is in, we need to pay attention to each other, thru the drug deals gone wrong, thru misguided money grubbing values, thru all the life experiences that bring us down to the ultimate reason we are on this planet--> to love and support each other through our hearts--that is what this film is about.
I still am glad I went and would rather watch a movie like Indigo that is about redemption than the exploitation that we are exposed to daily in the media and especially Hollywood movies.
I do not want to say much because this one holds a few surprises (you wont forget the opening sequence, actually that is if you can sit through it!!)
The movie taught me only one thing about indigo children, and that is the origin of the term (indigo for their "aura").
I love the story of the Indigo Children, and I cannot do anything but hope that most of the cases are true, because, if they are, these children represent a new wave of society that is very promising.
The seeming moral of this movie is that you can take a couple that is drifting hopelessly apart, strand them on a deserted island for a couple of days, and then they can live happily ever after.
Alma is the gaze of men in the film because she is young and vibrant, however, that is all she is allowed to be; an object of men's desire.
The first story explores the issue of homosexuality, which I think is a brave idea in a country that is quite religious.
Then ultimately you will be justly rewarded by film's end because this is one of the few, and I do mean few, American remakes (and a comedy no less) that is worth watching time after time!
For viewer who look for something that is nicely polished, Catwalk Actors and Popcorn Feeling, don't bother.
The writing is effortless, but so natural and brilliant, the characters are beautifully crafted and it makes a refreshing change to see a film that is not about the location or the effects - but about the story and characters.
The violence, too, is realistic, with the only credibility-stretching event being the afore-mentioned arrow in the head, but even that is nimbly explained.
Its his name that is selling the movie (or was it just a very long trailer?
His facial expression is what you're remembering during the picture, because (and that is very intelligent way of using the expectations of the public by the filmmakers) we have seen lots of vigilante films   (spoilers!)
Remember that is an old school action movie with a lot of social comment much more in the line of "Class of '84" (a film that almost only Roger Ebert defended in its premiere) than a Cannon film (that are great in their own way).
It is often said of Ellroy that his writing got better as it went along; and assuming that this film is closely based on the book, I would say that there's a good chance that is true as the story here is not exactly solid.
In fact, if it were not for the presence of James Woods that is all this would be, a good TV movie.
What comes out during the film is the corruption in the police department, something that is not new to the city of angels, and something we have seen again and again.
Now, that is THE way to make a horror movie.  
What I can't knock is the sinister and chilling atmosphere, with a misty house that is truly atmospheric and unnerving, especially the paintings on the walls, the menacing shadows, dim lighting and dark corners.
But that is exactly what this film is: NEW.
The plot isn't really the hi-lite here, it is the camera work and the atmosphere that is created.
Some other nice touches, like a great video game level maker that is a Japanese go girl with blonde mane instead of the expected 20-something white male hacker stereotype.
There are a few scenes in the film with laughable CGI by North American standards, but to nitpick about something that is so boringly dispensed in North American films would be such a gratuitous waste of time.
Even though, in 2009, we'd like to believe the neighbors, CPS or the police would step in, I fear that is not the truth.
He wants to help the girl that is being tortured, but feels helpless facing an adult.
I strongly advise you do not watch this movie, at the very least out of protest that the kind of violent porn that is illegal has somehow made it into our mainstream media.
I don't even know if I could look those actors in the eye without that feeling creeping over me if I ran into them in an airport-that is how engrossed I became in this story.
Those kids were little bastards to a degree that is unbecoming an actor of their ages.
I don't care how depressed you are, that is just sick.
Not committed by some entertaining movie-maniac like Freddy or Pinhead that cracks jokes while slaughtering folks, but by something that is a lot more frightening, more haunting and terrifying: an entirely normal human being.
It's here that 'The Girl Next Door' displays a remarkable economy of storytelling- a few key actions and utterances are all that is required to create a set of fully realised and psychologically plausible characters by which a remarkable set of occurrences are made credible.
While the boy is only mildly harmed in the film, it's an emotional roller coaster to be put in his shoes knowing everything that is happening and having nothing available to remedy it.
some of the movie is really really stupid and that is funny.
It even pokes a LOT of fun at Canadians (which I am), which makes it a hilarious free-for-all that is NOT for children or the easily offended.
What a surprise, then, that "Seven" is the type of smart, suspenseful, brilliantly-designed and -acted thriller that is nearly one-of-a-kind ("The Silence of the Lambs" follows close behind).
(This part contains Spoilers) In the beginning, Kyle, Stan, Cartman, and Kenny sneak into an R-rated Canadian movie that is made by their idols, Terrence and Philip.
by ridiculing the fuss that is made against profanity, the writers have safeguarded themselves against adverse publicity from complaints.
You arn't sure if it's John Doe that is the enemy or the world outside.
But perhaps sometimes when stigmas of that nature are forever embedded with your name and reputation, it actually gives them more leeway to make a statement that is political in nature.
Well if you had to parallel the two and replace horror with humour, that is a safe comparison.
But if that is what we want, then we have to be willing to go all the way.
**** One last observation and that is, when I was in line for the film, a lady and her five year old daughter were in front of me.
It's refreshing to see a surreal film that is not full of gloom and doom or mystical mayhem.
Yes, the performer reveals his own consciousness of the camera that is filming him; that is the whole point, and that is what makes it so inconsistently side-splitting.
Powered by some blue- energized meteor, it's like a tale of renewable energy sources that spells the future of mankind's effort in maintaining a paradise that is Metro City, though the by-product waste in red-energy is fairly unstable, and makes for a good source of power for the evil President Stone (Donald Sutherland) and his warmongering robot ironically called The Peacekeeper, in a kooky plan for re-election.
For the next fourteen minutes, he delivered an inaugural address that is still honored to this very day.
I'm still not too sure of the impact that is likely to have on youngsters, but maybe that says more about me as a Dad than it does about kids, because those in the cinema seemed to enjoy it.
It ends up as a movie that is both young at heart yet mature in content.
In the city that is shown, it's always raining, it's always dark and sinners move into the streets.
It seems any computer animated movie that is neither Pixar nor Shrek has a difficult time getting noticed.
It is a Sci-Fi film that is all about ideas.
As a person that is interested in Math and when I heard about Flatland the Film I had to obtain a copy.
warning:if you choose to watch this movie,know that you will enter on a dark and twisted journey.David Fincher directs this film,which concerns a serial killer who executes people,using the seven deadly sins as justification.though there are some horrific and graphic images here,there real genius of this movie is it's implied horror.this movie will leave you with an impact long after the end credits have rolled.David Fincher directs this intense psychological suspense thriller.Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt play two detectives on the trail of the killer.Freeman plays veteran Detective Lt. William Somerset,on the verge of retirement,after this case.Pitt plays rookie detective Detective David Mills.Kevin Spacey also stars in a powerful performance that is mesmerizing.this is one of the best movies of this genre i have seen so far.if you are not affected by this movie,i'd be surprised.for me,Se7en is easily a 10/10
One day she will call immigration authorities to report a clandestine camp in order to get it emptied for her load of slaves that is arriving on the following morning.
The central character (Angie) played by Kierston Wareing is a self employed recruitment agent an ambitious and vibrant women who wont take no for an answer, she has a certain cheek and charm that is compelling and shows us some level of kindness, but also has a darker side which she has no problems in showing to people.
it has a cohesive narrative that is logical and persuasive.
The show is funnier for me today than when it first aired, mainly because I now understand that the main target were not children but people of more age, something that is relatively unknown.
But that is where any promise of a good or even average movie ends.
Although I would have thought this movie was made in the 80's, that is not a bad thing - because most good movies were, so cudos to Cross for capturing a mood that is so hard to find in modern day horror.
Some people may say this film was good for a low budget movie, I say I thought it was written, directed and performed by a class of first year performing arts students, and that is what I honestly thought.
So, she decides to enlist the help of someone who maintains a web site that is part paranormal equipment dealer and part peepshow.
Really, the only attention-grabbing element - apart from Marini herself, that is - is the score; the pet goats are cute, too.
The one bright spot is Bill Cobbs who does a fairly decent job portraying the relationship of Houston's 'Yoda' to Patrick's 'Luke' (yes, there's even a line in the film that is essentially paraphrases "Do, or do not.
Another thing is how each of the four main characters have an epiphany, that is straight out the "crazy guy" film handbook.
There are many different things this movie talks about, and there is not a happy ending, something that is pretty cool.
Somerset, an intelligent, well-read man, is smart enough to recognize the truth, however painful that is.
This is a great comedy and one that is a treasure and a gem-just appreciate that they once made a bunch of comedies of this quality-This is one of the Greatones-though I wouldn't quite put it in the masterwork/All-Time Great Category.
Flagg and her sponsor in Nothing Scared are opportunists and they are living in our world of structure that is phony.
(I'd love to quote a few lines but I don't know if that is spoiler behavior or not).
The sinister music that is added keeps the heart pounding throughout and keeps the audience uncomfortable, in a good way.
Shivers starts by introducing us, the viewer that is, to Starline Tower a luxury high rise apartment complex situated on an island.
Shivers is shocking yes, but that isn't the point of the movie.
Now, that is scary.
"Shivers" is a movie that is mostly that way itself.
See, it seems some mad scientist was using the inhabitants of this virtual Eden to test out some replacement for organ transplants: a parasite that is also "a stimulant and an aphrodisiac".
SHIVERS is not nearly as memorable as some of Cronenburg's other works (VIDEODROME, THE FLY or my personal favorite - THE BROOD...) but it is still worth a look for anyone that is into Cronenburg's strange cinema.
Pretty cool concept that is handled well, and the film is both weird and entertaining as only Cronenburg can do it.
The movie starts dark, intense, chilling and mysterious, a mood that is present throughout the entire movie.
The two main characters played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are presented as an unlikely police-couple that are different in many ways from each other but in a way that is also what makes them such a great couple.
the opening scene is a great way to introduce the film, its not confusing (until you've watched the whole scene that is) and the film has the same sort of premise from there on.
This dark tale of murder and crime revolves around two detectives in present New York city played by two brilliant actors `Brad Pitt' and `Morgan Freeman' who are paired together to solve a puzzle of murder that is at the hands of a man who kills regarding to the seven deadly sins.
Werner shouldn't be directing anything remotely related to celluloid, from seeing the catastrophe that is 'Bloody Bill', as he tries to compensate for a rote and crappy script with much worse 'style'.
Maybe it's a personal thing, but it's a pet peeve for me when a director uses a specific tint for a purpose that is completely ancillary, where it's more about calling attention to itself than serving any meaningful stylistic choice (Spielberg may be the only one who can get away with it).
It's drek of the shlockiest order, and I'd have to be paid more than the actors themselves were (if they were that is) to sit through it again.
That's a shame because he is a talented actor that isn't afraid to take chances with both the roles that he picks and the characters that he plays.
But the script was amateurish, the dialogue was weak, the logic (that is, horror movie logic) was uneven and some of the camera shots were way too gimmicky (except for the flashbacks; those were cool).
Sato, Takashi Shimura offers a gentle honesty and low-key approach to life that is not tempered by any pity for the criminals; he even tells Murakami that he hates them...and says it so simply, it's like it's the most natural thing in the world.
The pursuit of a single gun creates a compelling story that is pushed further by human behavior and weather.
It reveals in its beauty the sheer dross that is the bulk of screen fodder, dwelling on which can make you a little sad, but knowing work such as this exists is so uplifting, it reminds you of the value of real reel art and artists.
In Stray Dog he weaves a tale that is part whodunit and part social drama.
I bought this DVD because I mistakenly thought that the premise had some interesting mystery/suspense possibilities, that the attractive, well-recognized cast would deliver entertaining performances, and that, even if the plot and acting failed, there still might be enough to make the film one of those movies that is fun to watch because of how bad it is.
Of course there can be "fluff" entertainment that is enjoyable.
The crew were good looking enough but they were so slovenly that they deserved to be keel hauled before breakfast, (for the sharks that is).
The finale comes completely out of character for Lou, a crime without motive that is frankly unbelievable and the final written statement makes it clear that whoever wrote this tripe had one too many misogynist nightmares.
The cutting is often startling, skipping along to that jazzy beat that is laid onto the soundtrack (I loved one scene where they show a early 50's party at a 'pad', records being played, grass being rolled, Bruce falling head over heels in a quiet way), and then with the comedy clips especially, we get the best and the worst of what Bruce had to offer, his peak in pointing out things with risquÃ© abandon (and ended up getting him in ridiculous trouble), and downfall into drugs and depression.
Also that is a great job on Inaritu's part being able to capture that emotion.
Curiously, this is a film that is neither a love-in nor a condemnation.
It's impressive because of the story, that is helped by its gritty atmosphere.
It is a Dirty Dozen-style shoot'em'up action film that ends up not very spectacular at all (although there are some scenes on top of a moving train that is reminiscent of 1983's Octopussy) and tries to be poignant now and then, humorous failing with every attempt.
If all of that is enough to do it for you, then I suggest you have at The Inglorious Bastards.
It's fun sometimes and that type of fun is also in "Basterds"; here we have first a German soldier with the bastards and he at one point will give Tony and the Italian dude a surprise, that is not quite as dangerous as in "Basterds" but really funny: Tony thinks this German only speaks German so he insults and stuff, you know (in "Basterds" the Jew Hunter, Christoph Waltz's character at one point surprises everybody with his really good Italian!
Six or so rebellious solders are off to a court Marshall to be sent away for life for their crimes but when their truck that is transporting them is bombed and attacked they escape and try to get to the neutral country of Switzerland.
The opening and closing titles, however, were apparently new material and feature some music that isn't heard anywhere else in the feature.
This is the real deal; if it's not one of the very best war films, it's certainly one that is one of the best you haven't heard of (least until recently thanks to the aforementioned PHD-in-film-incarnate).
But that is part of the point.
You're hired to find a man named Thomas Malloy... but that is just the beginning...everything becomes more complicated than that...  
This film is of the type that is supposed to be a horror and yet it makes you laugh and cringe at how bad it is.
And this film is the undisputed king of "tacky horror" - a genre that is supposed to be horror and yet turns out to be a comedy.
Renoir tells his tale in a simple, realistic style that is very effective; it is impressive that despite being a Frenchman he is able to capture the spirit of the American South.
His name is Isadore J. Blanco and is the 17 year old that is featured while working out in the field.
I believe that is called...magnificent acting.
The result is a dogs breakfast, that is, a complete mess.
I thought: I don't care if this is fiction or reality, that is a very real, poignant, caring, loving emotion she has just expressed.
Gypo produces a remarkably convincing look at a dysfunctional working class British family, with its goodness and badness, and it made me feel proud to be in a country that is producing such high quality, riveting cinema (and on such an incredibly tiny budget!)
The movie has a script that is so good it rivals scripts like American Beauty.
To me that is the proof she's is a great actress.
My main quarrel with romance movies is that they are targeted for a specific audience (females 18-30) and from working in a video store that is the demographic who rents them.
This also leads to a diatribe Melvin says to Simon that is so brutal that you can't help but feel bad but laugh at hystericaly.
There is a reason for Melvin's antics, which isn't explained until about 1/2 way through the film, and that is he has OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder).
The film also has a very well trained memorable dog that is amazing in its personality.
Maybe because it's a rare occasion nowadays to come across a movie that isn't stuffed with special effects.
As Good As It Gets is one of those incredibly moving films that is also hugely entertaining.
Movies like this come few and far between, and that is the reason why I appreciate this film so very much.
And if that is written as well as it is in this case, not even a happy ending can bother you.
I must say that the coolest thing about this film is the scarecrow and right being that is the gore and cool special effects.
Strangely, the only performance in the movie that is really distracting and out of place is Liam Neeson as Aslan, theÂumÂlion king.
However, this stands apart from the main story, so no real harm done...that is until they get to that main story.
There's a special scene between he and Lucy that is inventive and wonderful.
I mean for the cost of a weekend rental they could have had an epic movie making seminar and maybe they would not have ended up with this mess of a film that is right now playing in the background on my lap top.
But that is it.
The snow is dubious though, but I guess that is acceptable.
While this film has a few rough spots and a first act that needed some work THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH, and THE WARDROBE is an enchanting journey that is worth the price of admission.
Harry Gregson-Williams does do a fine job, but has not created a score that is quite good enough to work separate from the film.
Apart from that is totally and utterly unwatchable.
One that really should be studied in any film course that is on offer at tertiary institutions around the world.
It not only shows good versus evil it has such grand themes as science versus nature and a meditation on the religious right that is often over looked by the more carefree viewer.
It is a movie from the 80's that is just about fun and you don't have to worry about confronting any issues or tackling any controversial subjects.
Really one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and not one that is so bad it is good.
Her father is a powerful gang leader that is in the midst of a major power struggle.
Al "Fuzzy" St. John would have been funnier -- seriously, he seldom makes a move that isn't at least a little funny -- if he hadn't been quite so intrusive, which is not his fault but that of the script or director.
(You'll understand why that is funny if you see the movie.)
He was way ahead of his time, and I think that is why people feared him.
But by chance (there are a number of plot furtherances in this film that come about by chance--but that is not a problem because the chance meetings seem natural and are events that would probably happen eventually)--and so by chance he is hooked up with a young woman fresh from China who speaks no French, but is an expert pianist who needs a little money.
And that is, I think, when his heart stopped beating.
As a character study of Thomas, the film somewhat succeeds in presenting his ambivalence as a petty criminal and as a frustrated pianist that is trying to regain his skill in playing the instrument.
In Romain Duris, director Audiard gets a multi layered performance that is what keeps the film going.
The split that is also apparent in the character's parents, one a classic pianist who's passed on (the mother), and the other a more criminal-type of a father, also gives the film an added boost of psychological energy.
The fact that beaside Darryl Hannah as the star all the other actors are unknow or not well known this side of the pond, and that what makes it an excellent film.....l got it on video and watched it twice in the same day and that is something l don`t often do...
Mexico has had one of the best movie producing industries in the world for decades, that is only belatedly getting the attention it deserves in the U.S.
Cary Grant and Irene Dunne had long been a favorite screen couple in the madcap screwball comedies THE AWFUL TRUTH (1937) and MY FAVORITE WIFE (1940), and here the duo both deliver absolutely tour de force dramatic performances that is far removed from their typical fare of the time.
Another thing that is very impressive about the film is a unique film technique for its time.
The only compelling aspect is the family's predicament, but sadly that isn't the focus, and it doesn't satisfactorily change.
I wasn't much of a Cary Grant fan until I saw this film for the first time about 10 years ago, and I also discovered the embodiment of grace and charm that is Irene Dunne as well.
The Garage does a great job at portraying the life of a kid that is stuck between leaving or staying, and the choice might seem easy to some of us, but we are able to see that it is very difficult.
The third time I watched this film I understood the clear severity of discrimination and hatred that is deflected onto various individuals in American "society".
It is such a story that is told extraordinarily because of how it takes itself seriously as a historical document, but never so much so as to get in a great joke - the kind of natural joking that people do, such as the few quips done by Yeagher in the cockpit to whoever was listening after breaking the sound barrier, which actually happened - or some sliver of satire to the mix.
He has a story that is told all unto often today.
Yet underneath all the fun that is poked at the astronauts we see respect for real men doing a scary, important job.
The film mix religion and mysticism when tells the history of a boy created in the Amazonian forest that is taken to be educated in an orphanage.
But when I see a drama and the story or events are so gripping that I get involved with the characters and cry for them and with them, then that is a really good movie.
And that is what "Grave of the Fireflies" is; a masterpiece.
Seita stays tired of that, and decides that is best to him and Setsuko to live in a different place, that is a kind of an abandoned shelter.
They never lose their innocence, and that is what makes this story so compelling.
Through it's well observed and very real characters, Grave of the Fireflies portrays a story of loss, heartbreak and the effect of war on civilians in a manner that is more effective and more firmly based in reality than many live action films about the same subject are.
From that point on, the two children embark on a journey that is every bit as unpleasant and difficult as the grim realities of the world around them.
Whatever "cheese" the show has, whether you consider it fun or not, that is what good drama, whether scripted or true-life, really should be about.
Of errors that is.
Overall, a perfect opera film, that is a real tearjerker.
It can make you reflect on your own personal situation and that is the message of a powerful film.
Thus, the core of the relationship between two people is examined, and the betrayals and regrets that come once love is gone and a new one has come to take its place are shown to be part of the cycle, the cycle that is love -- a force as synonymous with birth, healing, and life as it is with destruction.
A group of Bounty Hunters looking for criminals, that is how you see the series the first time you watch it, but believe me: THIS IS A MUST SEE if you want to feel alive.
*...sigh...* Oh and the music...oh GOD, the symphony that is the music!!!
Overall, the series is not the brooding anime/manga fare, as I have stated before, but a 007-esque romp that could be made into a smashing movie...which, coincidentally is due out 2011...and I PRAY it holds up to the fantastic masterpiece that is Cowboy Bebop.
I think the best way to begin this would be not to thank but to bear hug,the creative geniuses who created this piece of art..i mean everything about this show is f**king perfect-the characters,the plot,the direction,the music,the screenplay,the script..Its a perfect example of when all the things come together to make something that is larger than the creators themselves..I don't know how i stumbled across the page of cowboy bebop but it must have one my lucky days..I have to say i was not intrigued from the plot as much as from the characters,which i read about in the comments..my expectations from the show were pretty low despite the rating but man when i watched its first two episodes,even the 9.4 rating seemed an insult..and IT IS THAT GOOD..you would filled with awe for its creators after you watch it..you would even love the cowboy bebop sign that comes in between the show..The best thing about the show is that is has no specific genre,or you can say its a genre in itself..i wont have the slightest doubt if the show gets a cult status..so you never know whats gonna come out in the next scene,whether you will be convulsing with laughter or staring at the screen in empathy for one of the characters..as the show goes on and on,you keep on going deep into the skin of the characters..you don't know when it happens that the characters just occupy a permanent space in your head..you start to wish that they are always around..with a bored spike smoking his cigarette,jet watering his plants ,sulky faye with her frown and industrious ed jumping around with his laptop..and when the show ended,i actually felt a part of my life going away..and i bet you will feel the same way when the show ends..you will stare into the eyes of spike and say " no this is not going to happen,i wont let you go"..its a rare feeling for someone in real life but its almost impossible for someone in reel life..  so my respect to shinichiro wantanbe from the bottom of my heart for directing the show so perfectly and congratulations to hajami yatate for writing something so perfect in itself..and kobayashi and yoko kanno,no man i ain't forgetting them either..the show wouldn't have been complete without their music which encompasses everything from jazz to metal to blues to country to electronic..I urge everyone who reads this comment to watch this show..doesn't matter if you're not an anime fan..this show is apiece of art and it must not be missed..and if you're an anime fan,then you wont be seeing something as great as this in a long time..i guess if you take my word,then you're in for one of your luckiest days of your life..  SEE YOU IMDb COWBOY..
Be assured that is one extraordinarily rare occurrence on TV, at least for me.
The music complements the show in such a way that is so rare today.
What a marvelous adventure this film is, an adventure that is also magnificent film-making with not an ounce of fat.
It is so good to see us British people doing these type of films for a change--that is what made it really 'new' and a bit more intersting than all its american counterparts.
The movie starts off introducing us to some student housemates, and there lives, quickly cutting off to a night out clubbing, and that is when the problems begin.
Unfortunately Mr Adams also wrote the screenplay and it's this that is the film's undoing   I'm not much of a horror fan and though I enjoyed the 2002 releases where the British Army let off a few shots at monsters in abandoned houses there's little in this movie to recommend unless you're a horror movie addict
There is some nice ( that is not really the apt word!
Hav Plenty is a clever romantic comedy that is appealing because of its unique cast.
And Marge Champion is the only one of the stars from this film that is still alive today at age 90.
So, for a great cartoon that is never dull and full of thrills, look no further than "Darkwing Duck!"
Only a person that is thoughtful enough can do such thing with such grace and yet be so aggressive about it.
It makes absolutely no sense, but that is what is so striking about this scene as well as many in that, the girl, who is right in front of their eyes speaking with them, can't be found, thus sending these parents to act on their toes to try and find her.
This film takes everything we learn that is "correct" and turns it upside down.
This three-times occurrence of faeces, the mentioning of Pasolini and the insight that form and function must abolish only because of human evolution leads the critical watcher to a conclusion about the sociology of human life that is not too far away form that of Pasolini: All mankind is able to produce is faeces.
The strange thing is about this film, and I've come to realize it more after seeing Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie again recently (my favorite feature length film of his), is that there is such a line that is walked, like a tightrope walker holding an elephant in one hand and a thumbnail in the other, that one wonders whether this should be taken totally seriously or just with the general hysteria and (crucially) absurdism that laces much of Bunuel's work in his post Mexico period.
It's a rousing, good time film that is worth watching......I like it!
Dietrich plays a jealous girlfriend and Scott is the new dude in town that is muscling in.
There are no real characters, just stereotypes, and almost everything that is planned to be a surprise is quite easy to predict in advance.
And with that being said, 7 seconds is just about as watchable an anything being produced these days unless you want to soil your sensibilities in the mire of sadistic garbage that is being pushed at us now.
He seems to be the only card carrying Black man that is licensed to do that in American Cinema.
The only thing I liked was that they used "Club Twice" (the club of one of the characters) in the movie, and that is one of my favorite clubs.
The only other documentary I've seen that is comparable is Gates of Heaven.
For example the Django in the title will alert anyone who's seen the Franco Nero film of Django what is inside the coffin that is dragged around.
This is probably the only time you'll ever see me say that about anything that isn't a comedy which I want revoiced by Mexican actors.
There are great tragic comic scenes like when a man tries to catch a sword that is going through his head, or when an enormous hole is made on a man.
When one thinks of the cowboy Western names like John Ford, Sam Peckinpah, Howard Hawks and John Huston might come to mind but Japanese new wave and cult director Miike Takashi would probably be the last person you would think of being on that list, that is until now.
The technical beeps in the background gave off a really cool surreal, modern feel that isn't overdone or annoying.
The trademark vacanta mare humor is toned down a few notches and the result is a spoof that is funny at times, hilarious at others and flat here and there.
This movie is sharply written, humorous with a message that is not laid on in a schmaltzy manner.
If you haven't watched it, I honestly think you should, because this is a mist-see cinematographic treasure that is rare to find in today's modern chaos.
It is not the acting that is bad, it is not fantastic, but it is everything this film has going for it.
Mutual attraction will place limits on both of their lives - if they manage to stay safe for long enough, that is...  Costner is well-suited to playing the stoic and intense action man, and casting Whitney Houston as a singer allows her a fairly comfortable start in the movies.
The girls take revenge and kill the dudes cold, but that isn't where it ends.
Not too hard to see why that is.
Think of it this way, you are going to buy a new car you opt for the one that is a bit cheaper and comes with out.
The humor adds an element that isn't all too characteristic of these kinds of films but nevertheless is a welcome relief.
If it sounds implausible to the point of imbecility, well, that is not my fault.
Especially that Night of the Dead Leben Tod that is the worst movie ever made.. Chuck and Chance are Spielbergs compared to that crap.
The title refers to the section of suburban Paris that is inhabited by first-generation Jewish immigrants--most of them from North Africa.
Finally he manages to safely reach her to Delhi where she asks him to marry her and leave for Britain.Though by this time he is also deeply in love with her, he must fulfill his 'Dharma' now, that is to marry his fiancÃ© Lakshmi .
Jay Cocks' screenplay is a true rarity - a script that is stimulating emotionally as well as intellectually.
And the random goons who storm the office building shooting at papers on desks is pretty cool, if you like random goons who shoot at paper on desks that is.
(before the "THE END" hits the screen) and that is when Lugosi shoots Petrillo but the scene ends to quick.
As remarkably bad this film is, somehow there is a certain macabre interest in watching a film that is at such a level.
Corman would have made an exploitation film that viewers would still be talking about today and it would have been full of nudity and graphic events but alas, Lieberman instead directed a film that is completely forgettable.
Not a great film by any stretch, but worth at least a one time view to the "cult" fans out there...The Synapse disc also has a short-film called THE RINGER that is another strange bit of 70's weirdness that deals with consumerism, drugs, music, the naivetÃ© of youth, and "THE MAN" - and is pretty interesting too.
In the meantime, Pooja has also started falling in love with Raj and when she wakes up from her coma, she identifies Raj as her husband although that is not true.
There is only one song in there which I really like, and that is 'Piya Piya'.
I gave it a 4 rating, because the reason you buy a concert DVD is for the concert, and that is what I would rate the first disc.
If everyone here writes to TV Land, they might revive it, that is if anyone there remembers.
But that is the history of early television and the masters, male and female, behind it all.
One that that is important to note: there wasn't such thing as "syndication" as we all know it back then.
acceptance is important to me, that is one of the reasons I love this show, maybe more then that 70's show + that tuesday is like the finest thing i have ever seen :)
It had some creative moments in it which now a days that is all you can really expect from a zombie movie.
And the "black joke" that is supposed to be a shocking, critical point in the drama isn't even all that offensive.
I like these movies for many different reasons and that is a whole other topic altogether, perhaps in the forums...
The reason I said that is because she couldn't handle Kevin being engaged to Charlie.
I always think its the mark of a good actor to pull off the consistent lurching that is the hallmark of sentimental romcom.
It was a story of the Journey.. the hardship we face.. the reality that we have so few choices... the pain we take in becoming healthy individuals in a society that is so foreign from us, yet within miles of our life.
Normal, that is, until Jen's worries over the kids all playing for the same team begin to encroach, and she enlists Kim Chui's help in saving the day.
Boy that is amazing I can remember those details.
Ironically, Wyckoff does his own negotiating with the law, demanding to see the psychiatrist that is in charge of treating him.
Watch for a sign advertising "Friz" (Freleng, that is).
Time after time, the clothes come off, the girls are making out, you see a little fur-burger here, a little whisker-biscuit there(just frontal, no open clam), and just when it looks like the chicks are going to get down to some serious munching, it just cuts to some worthless clip of them cuddling after they had "made love", whatever the hell that is.
Well, that is up to you-- it's not like it is some kind of "torture porn" but it isn't an Oscar winner.
"Emmanuelle" is an elegant, excellently photographed movie, but too often rolls in a syrupy pretensionÂ   It is about a young, French woman who joins her husband in BangkokÂ There much of Emmanuelle's allure is that she isn't shy about her body, or even afraid to engage in sexual activity in semipublic placesÂ   There are a number of rousing, lesbian meetings very typical of French cinema, coupled with encounters with handsome, sensitive men who enjoy superficial lovemakingÂ The film really deals in sensual images and an over-blown, continuous repeating of its erotic philosophyÂ There is sensual intimacy between Emmanuelle and the other women that is rare in the cinemaÂ  My favorite moment when teen-ager Christine Boisson comes upon the nude Sylvia Kristel asleepÂ Without embarrassment, she leans forward and unusually caresses gently and affectionately Emmanuelle's breast with her fingerÂ
With that said - that is the difference.
One moment characters are engaging in sexual activities, the next they are spewing pretentious dialog, and then they do something totally unexpected that is seemingly from another movie.
The DVD goes as far as to provide an 'alternate' ending that is just as ridiculous but ten times more confusing.
Nearly all the book content made it into the film, but there's much of the film that isn't part of the novel.
As I have said, this film seems to go out of its way to be offensive, under the guise of a film that is merely observing offensive people.
All this film does that is of any note is to go so far up its own arse that is almost comes off as parody.
The actors are all quite good and do their best with what they are given --- and, that isn't much.
It's always a great experience to "find" a hereto for unknown film, that is a title that we know very little about, if even of it's existence.
And the screen version follows the lead, and makes it everything that is Mexican, but without a name.
Although in the end it's a bit simplistic it does have an undeniable poetry in it that is in the league of the director's finest work.
The production crew exercised creativity in casting Ms. Allen in a role that is unusual for her and she once again proves her more than ample theatrical talents.
Although that isn't really saying that much since this movie really doesn't have much in common with Death Race 2000 other then the title.
Death Race is just pure entertainment, it's nothing original, we don't really know the characters that well or what their motives are, but the reason why this movie is enjoyable is just the awesome action that is endless.
It's not a Martin Scorsese film where you sit back and think "Oh, that is very thought-provoking and I feel that I've truly learned something inspirational today."
this movie isn't my cup of tea.i couldn't watch it all,since i lost interest,but form what i saw,it just wasn't good.i just found it boring,with pretty bad acting,and a plot that is all over the place.it's a Russian made movie,the second i have seen now.the first one being Nightwatch.i didn't like that movie either.it also has a plot that doesn't make a lot of sense,at least in my opinion.anyway,Mirror Wars starts off promising enough,with some scenes of jet fighters doing maneuvers,which look pretty impressive.after that though,it's not so good.i wouldn't recommend it myself,but if you liked Nghtwatch,you might like this movie.for me,Mirror Wars is a 3/10
Each of these characters is defined not by what they are striving for together, although that is the one thing they share in common, but by the weaknesses in their characters, the baggage they have brought with them from childhood, that have made them who they are and conspire to defeat their goals.
A film that is both cynical and optimistic.
The rest of the cast (Bokeem Woodbine, Lisa Nicole Carson, Eddie Griffin, among others) are exceptional in a story that is both tragic and uplifting.
Well, that is what they do with their actors.
:-)  I think the roughest scene is when one guy takes a bite out of another guy and even that is handled pretty lightly.
In this low budget film Cher plays an overworked public defender that is given a high work load instead of her year vacation.
Caught up in this courtroom scene is Dennis Quaid, portraying a member of the jury that is unable to keep himself from being drawn to Cher.
The story on itself certainly isn't that bad, but the plot is a bit far-fetched and gives this movie an ending that is a bit too abrupt.
Andrew Currie has created a personal, magnificant film that is all that and a bag of potato chips.
Some of the shots are done with a beauty and grace that is in such sharp contrast with the lives of the Afghan people.
And that is a pitiful shame.
A simple and sad story told in a beautiful picture, but what makes the film really interesting is the context of it, the dramatic reality of a reli-fascistic society in which women mean nothing that is outlined to us.
and that is just how the movie ends...just "beautiful" and full of "hope"!
In a time when the world is so focused on the conflict unfolding in Iraq, the thing that is most clear to me after watching this movie is the old saying that after thousands of years of wars fought in the name of religion, we are not a second closer to peace than we ever were.
Osama shows us that it is the very concept of religion that is used in some practices to justify that suffering for which we look above for reasoning and comfort.
Yet, at the center of this great film is not only the ellipsis of information, but the ellipsis of self- the exile from everywhere, a theme that defines much of Angelopoulos's work, even if it does not define his art, for that is always on target, and brilliantly wrought.
The entire movie seems to be in slow motion, but that is just the studied, unhurried rhythm of Angelopoulos' direction.
The story progresses through the World Wars, the civil wars, the influence of Hitler and Mussolini, the natural disasters of floods and disease, the social disparities of class, the rise of unions, the fall of democracy - all mirrored in the family that is trying to make the chaos of living in Greece resemble some sort of order.
History and human relationships are emphasized through the symbolic order of ancient Greek tragedy and that is what makes the film have a more "heavy" character, which makes it a little harder to follow than a usual Hollywood production- do not misjudge me, I love it too.
Alas, that is not the case here.
None of the characters speak or behave in a way that is even remotely believable.
Until that is, into their number unexpectedly arrives a young man of reduced circumstances, Tom Townsend, (Edward Clements) who by virtue of his sincerity and intelligence, is invited to "sup at their table--on a borrowed pass" so to speak.
This one is nowhere near as graphic as a typical entry in that genre, but there is one lesbian love scene that is strikingly filmed and acted, suprisingly graphic for such young-looking actresses, and really kind of a tonal shift from the rest of the film.
Lillie has a physical presence that is mesmerizing; her face is not traditionally beautiful, or even traditionally feminine (an aspect which is exploited in the story)--yet she is all the more striking as a result.
The characters are all important to the film, by that I mean there are no "fluff" characters... except for the one that is "fluff" on purpose but that is obvious.
Their "chemistry" throughout the movie is what gets the most laughs, along with Willem Dafoe's character that is also very comical.
Many strong points to a film that is flawed by technical problems.
There's a lot more to the film that is bogus, but as I said the film is so well written and fun, I found myself uncharacteristically NOT complaining as the truth wasn't quite as fun and exciting as fiction.
Sure there are some parts, like the video-game sequence where Richard goes all Lord of the Flies that is a bit ridiculous.
The whole thing was so unrealistic that is was just pathetic.
The director somehow thought that we should see any kind of sympathy and actually care about what happens to Richard, and forgive him for his actions, instead he is the only guy in this movie that is actually disgustingly inhumane.
Go to the Philipines or any place that isn't as crowded as Thailand.
This movie that is a new variation of the lost paradise is a disappointment.
It's based on a well regarded novel by Alex Garland , features Leonardo Dicaprio a megastar after his role in TITANIC and is directed by Danny Boyle one of Britain's greatest living directors and yet it's a film that is difficult to enjoy and it's easy to explain why - characterisation   Take one American pretty boy , send him in Thailand , stick him on an island with a bunch of selfish , unsympathetic people and watch a potentially good film fall apart .
Yet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame.
There is no doubt that '24' is pure drama, innovative, well acted and well written but When I was starting to think that it might be fun to watch one whole season consecutively, that is 24 episodes in 24 hours, I knew it was time to get off the train.
I will not say who or when or how, but there have been several amazing actors on the show, and just when you think they have killed off your favorite, someone new comes in that is just as good.
Wait, wait, there's maybe two or three action scenes in an entire season, in a show that is labeled "action."
Now that is a quality show.
All this makes "24" definitely a show that is not worth viewing.
Small change, simply portraying 'victims' of a dangerous-laden criminal society---that is the core of this work.
It's not a film of beauty in anyway it's ugly and twisted but that is what it does so well you can't help but fall in love with the film and the characters involved.
It's upsetting and raises a lot of topics that is worth discussing and bringing forward.
The other is police officer Scagnetti, an insane, perhaps sadistic officer that is in love with Mallory - he also has some weird obsession with mass killers, since his mother was killed during the massacre at Waco, Texas by Charles Whitman.
The violence (and the whole film) is completely over the top because that is what Stone is telling us; "We have gone too far."
THAT is what NBK is all about, and that is what it seeks to discourage.
Having media glorify violence is even more so, because that is what is happening.
I can't even explain how wrong that is.
But as a postmodernist satire of media saturation-violence, from wrestling to sit-coms to real crime dramatizations to obsessive live news interviews, Stone's film is a thought provoking exercise that is stylistically mesmerizing.
), rather than the violence (which apparently seems to be causing a misguided sh!tstorm of controversy, too, and like the sex, I don't think that people are that impressionable), namely the kind that is seen in music videos and such.
When it comes to horror films, the only tried and true formula that has stood the test of time (besides red food coloring and corn syrup) is the anthology; that is, a combination of stories that form the body of a movie.
Everyone did their parts to tee - the ditsy girl does get killed and the annoying guy will get killed, that is what we like to see.
This very "un-mainstream" level film is a horror gem that is absolutely worth a peek and I look forward to the future blood-covered delights created by the fearmakers team.
Haille Gerima has a spirit and a soul that generates throughout the movie that the end is one that is positive and not filled with bitterness.
I believe this is a must see for everyone regardless of races..The strength alone of the people, to deal with what they faced and to still rise above that is absolutely Incredible.
Especially when all that is portrayed... is the abuse.
Very low budget Â but that is not what made it bad.
So many people compare low budget and local artist to high, block buster, household name movies in which that isn't fair.
I would point out to those considering watching it that the average is 5.3 stars and in my opinion, that is generous.
Monkey Island is at the top rank (When it comes to Computer games, that is).
It should not be overlooked that in many other parts of the world it is a right that is still denied; for too many women it remains a distant hope.
There is some hokey stuff in this movie (as there is in most "liberty or death" flicks), but that is far outweighed by the fact that it has the ability to teach young people today about women's suffrage without making them fall asleep.
The film takes place in a vivid world that is somewhat inside Steve's head.
I can't abide cheap, phony productions, and that is what we too often get in these American pieces.
Yet, it is the story that is a heart grabber and should send everyone to the library to learn more about the suffragettes trials.
His humor is dry, his films are dry, but that is what makes him different than others in his field.
However, it certainly is an above average example of the giallo genre, with narrative that is better than most gialli and even has a terrific climax, but it's also certainly not a classic film in any respect.
The film is also known as 'Man Without Memory', and that is down the fact that the central character, Peter, has lost his memory.
And that is what sets this apart from most other games, and is it's most memorable quality: when the Dreamcast, which I had this game on, "died" and my console fell into disrepair, I found something I have found with only one other game since: I began to mourn for the loss of the game, and began to miss it terribly.
However, the fast pace of the music that is here does suit the action on screen well.
Something that is often lost in the transition from a 2-D world.
In part that is because the originally intended version would never have approached the perfection of the original "Amberson's".
So even if the movie doesn't thrill you, you can at least revel in the nude scenes (if you're into that sort of thing, that is).
A legendary whale bone that is said to have magical powers which gives any nautical creature the ability to breath on land while it's in their possession.
I almost forgot that is was Slater playing the part of Bob.
An office drone that is ready to administer his "justice" to all those who refuse to accept him, when an unexpected twist occurs that leads him down a different path.
Some guy said that is a combination of Falling Down, Office Space and some other film.
Maconel starts to question himself and he finds himself in a situations that is changing for the worst.
A movie with serious and poignant themes that isn't afraid to let out the full force of human emotion and confusion.
(She gets her comeuppance in one particular scene that is all of hilarious, disgusting, and disturbing.)
Come on, we've all seen the reports "He Was a Quiet Man, he mostly kept to himself..." Going Postal is a commonplace term that is known by anyone, and certainly a feeling that can be understood from anybody that has ever had a thankless office job.
The soundtrack leaves a little to be desired, and some of the cgi is a bit fake looking, but on the whole this is a character study that is well worth watching that, while leaving an ambiguous and somewhat dystopian ending is well worth checking out.
Despite the aforementioned reliance on visual effects, the film is unquestionably carried by the barely-recognisable Slater who, despite his recent collaboration with tragically awful director Uwe Boll, proves that he is still worth something in Hollywood, with comic timing that is nothing short of spot on.
A delightful group of players make the most of a screenplay that is filled to the brim with chucklesome dialogue.
Meanwhile Thorne associates to the scum Cody Clark (John Emery) and together they hire the outlaw Harley Baskam (Michael Pate) that is considered the fastest gunner in the region to duel with Calem and kill him and leave Medicine Bend ready for their dirty businesses.
Hardly anything that is not bleak.
Everything that is good or bad about Lynch, depending on who you are talking to, can be found in this production.
She's all over the shop but then I suppose that is what acting is all about.
The reason I say that is not purely because of the experience of watching the movie's chaos but also because of the process he went through.
Finally, I'd like to point out that this is Laura's Best as well (perhaps that is what is written on her fist?).
Just like the guy that comes down from the screen in Allen's movie has no idea you need keys to drive a car, the characters in IE have no idea that they sometimes play in a movie that is not theirs and has other rules.
If you have seen this film, you will probably view the interpretation below as too simplistic - that is, if you got it.
I miss the polished look of his older films but I guess that is going to be another thing that sets this movie apart from the others.
It lose some of the cinematic flourish of film, but also brings a more realistic, gritty feel to it that is appropriate for the theme.
Lynch really explores the freedom of movement and editing that is available with digital, and you can feel his energy and zest in the new medium.
How this man doesn't have an Oscar (for a performance that is) is beyond me.
Loving, glorious comedy nostalgia that is both a dreamy-eyed glance at old-time movie matinÃ©es & stardom as well as a smashingly production-detailed ode to those seemingly innocent, care-free days of the 1950's and its dawn of television.
For the purposes of the plot, there has been a weekly segment of the show (Kaiser insists on it, showing a substantial public spirit here that is just not evident elsewhere), spoofing the thieving union racketeer (here named Karl Rojeck - Cameron Mitchell).
Shakur plays Bishop, a troubled youth that is the main culprit in the murder of another young man.
To our eyes today it looks (much like March of the Wooden Soldiers) as if the animation was done in a 3rd grade video class, but that is part of the charm of the movie and I think you will find yourself laughing at it as I did, from the charm and not out of cynicism.
All in all this is a fun family film that is a must for all to see- Now that it is available on DVD maybe more people will get the opportunity to see it.
And that is to laugh.
I believe that is the greatest innovation of this anime.
This film is like a light at the end of a long, boring tunnel that is the general doldrum of cookie cutter animated films released year round.
that is not allowed in the Sikhism religion.
BAD BAD acting, coupled with a story that is absolutely stupid, I feel stupid for having watched this movie.
An undemanding movie that is easy to watch and does not get boring.
Unlike the sludge that is SNOWBOARD ACADEMY, the writing is great and the film fun for all ages.
The unfunny comedian is portrayed by Jim Varney in a toe-curlingly horrible performance; although it's just possible that Varney is outdone by John Ross, who plays an uptight scheming skier in a performance that is so atrocious it's an instrument of evil.
The very idea of a film script that is possessed by an evil spirit is hilariously silly.
"Death By Dialogue" is your typical low budget direct to video crap that is produced after someone's fame.
Here is a movie that is all surface image, devoid of sub-textural agendas and meanings that go beyond the obvious.
I admire the movie's honesty in not trying to be anything but complete crap, and having a sense of humor about itself that is quite refreshing.
All in all, a very overlooked film, that is actually very clever.
While it's certainly not one of Hithcocks best, it have a few scenes that is just wonderful, and characters.
It is also False Flashback that is responsible for some of the major events in the film like Alastair Sim (Commodore Gill) putting the blood on the doll to frighten Charlotte (Marlene Dietrich).
Eve's father Commodore Gill (Alistair Sim) lodges Jonathan at his house and the man destroys the dress that is the evidence of the murder.
Meanwhile Detective Wilfred Smith (Michael Wilding) that is in charge of the case befriends Eve and they fall in love for each.
The British character actors did the most with their parts (including Todd, who shows a nervousness and uncertainty in most of the film that is suggestive of possible insanity at the end).
This and it's two (disappointing) sequels, that is.
Tsuzuki is my favorite, but even the villain,Muraki, that is a very bad guy, cannot make me hate him,because without him, many awesome moments would never happen.
And that is the whole film, believe me.
Absolute Giganten is the story of a night that is so ordinary and because of that so honestly that you're going to enjoy every minute of it.
I really hope that the synchronisation of the dialogues get even the half of the lovely style that is brought by the german characters, beacuse this is what makes me smile, remembering scenes where guys like "Dulle" act.
And take the script too, as you go; if you can find one, that is.
But I think that is one of its many charms: It's unpredictability.
Translations might be good but you always loose the words that is unspoken.
The Movie got a mainpart which is the crime scene, a sub-part that is the competition at work (who should have the power...), and a sub-part wich contains the daily problems in the family of the main caracter.
'The Pursuit of Happiness' emerges as a safe but inspirational tale that is undeniably readily-molded for both public praise and Oscar buzz.
And Mr. SmithÂthe older one, that isÂhasn't been lying in his much-publicized interviews that this film is a turning point in his acting career.
It is without a doubt the performance of Will Smith's career, and anyone who says that that isn't saying much is crazy.
When his wife leaves him and his son to go get a better life, Chris is left on his own, but he wins an internship at a stocks broker company that is very competitive.
Basically, if you see this movie and walk out of it feeling nothing, there is something that is very wrong with you.
There is a great lesson that is learned in this movie and it truly shares the struggles of everyday life.
I rate it 7/10 because it hits my spot when i need a pick me up, perhaps that is too high in this age where comedy is the hardest genre to succeed in, but don't believe the low rating here on this site, it's a delightful little comedy that is far from perfect, but hell!, it's a heavenly piece knowingly incorporating the serious side of religious belief.
It shows the struggle of black youth in a whole new light; I can't help but feel for Q and his friends because that is something that could happen to anyone.
In my opinion, it is a great film that is far too compelling to be worthy for those and it should have been nominated for Academy Awards rather than Razzies.
But then, that is the Director's call and Kasdan couldn't seem to let the project go.
Then this same man or woman who tells me what i imagine poeple as goes on to say she imagines Doc Holliday as a "sly and witty sort of character the way Kilmer played him" Well that is fabulous, but the fact is that Doc, who was a witty person was witty in the way Dennis Quaid portrays him.
Eventually, he becomes a lawman and that is when we meet the mysterious and quiet Wyatt Earp that nobody likes.
In New York, he has a wife and a child that is supposed to be a product of napalm I suppose.
I work a block away from the rail yard that is shown very often in the film, and actually hung out down there in my teens.
"Combat Shock" stars Ricky Giovinazzo as Frankie Dunlan,a depressed Vietnam veteran living a meaningless life in Staten Island.With no money,no job and little hope,Frankie takes to the streets,shocked by the depravity of the neighborhood-of childhood friends turned junkies and prostitutes.The viewer watches Frankie meander through his bleak existence before a bloody and nihilistic finale that is not for the squeamish.
You'll never see a high school again filled with as many thin, beautiful coeds as Mr. Vadim presents in this movie all sporting the shortest of mini skirts that is, while they're still IN their clothes.
Vadim films these young ladies, many of which appear to be underage, in a method that is so unapologetically sexual that you'll soon understand why this film will likely never appear on DVD.
Aside from its authentic license, Clone Wars is accompanied by the classic John William score as well as other additional score that is reminiscent to other cartoon shows you can think of.
A man called sarge is one of those movies that isn't for everyone, but those of us that don't hate it, love it.
Most of the jokes are crude and cruel, and that is why many of us love it so much.
And it has a great sense of self-awareness that is funny only if it is done correctly, which it is.
I think that is why this show didn't make it, because The Newz was as good as Kids in the Hall and much better than Saturday Night Live.
It would be really fascinating to read a french viewer's opinion, since that is the original language of "Joyeuses Paques".
Why Adam Sandler would make a horrible movie like that is beyond my comprehension,specially because he has a potential to be a much better comedian then that!
His extraordinarily stupid fake accent and personality that would insult the intelligence of an eleven year old give the writers, (Adam Sandler, Judd Apatow, and SNL writer Robert Smigel) the framework to create a movie that is incomprehensibly bad.
There are several scenes illogically strewn together depicting Zohan doing some more stupid $hit and further cementing this movie as being the most racist mainstream movie ever made that the American public completely ignores because they're too dense to be able to comprehend anything that isn't expressed explicitly.
To me that is mind boggling.
It's a dreary trudge through migraine-inducing territory that is all the more unforgivable considering the level of talent involved.
Others review this flick as if a parapsychologist COULD make sense but that is impossible.
A disappointing movie that really doesn't present anything that isn't better done elsewhere.
The gore is another interesting thing because the murders are something different for a ghost film, the acting is OK in some parts but that isn't a main thing for Ghosthouse.
The ghostly hymn that is heard whenever something bad is going to happen is creepy as well.
Many questions that would seem crucial to the plot are left unanswered, not to mention that the ending of the angels/aliens taking the "chosen" children away to "safety" (another planet that is meant to be a juxtaposition of the Garden of Eden) has a similar feeling to reading the last sentence of a book that says "And then I woke up and realized the whole thing was just a dream."
Whenever I go to a movie that is starring Nick Cage, I try to temper my expectations.
At times your brain may have to turn on in order to follow the film, but that is what made Knowing such a pleasant surprise to me.
The result is a film that is no better than it ought to be, never going anywhere unexpected.
This is one of those movies that is often passed over by people who would love it if they watched it.
Keane is a brilliant and unique film and it is, without a doubt, Damian Lewis's finest performance Â and that is really saying something because he is a wonderful actor who is capable of conveying great feeling with his eyes and body and with a minimum of words and without overacting.
The film's action covers only a few days and it very clearly portrays the hell that is this man's minute-to-minute existence with excruciating detail.
I hope I am not giving the impression that Keane is a depressing film because it's not and it ends with the basically decent man that is William Keane triumphing over his illness Â at least for the moment.
An important film that is a tour-de-force for both Lodge Kerrigan's tight direction and Damian Lewis' craft as an actor.
And the reality that Lodge Kerrigan and the actor, Damian Lewis, create in 'Keane' is one that is particularly difficult to create - it is a reality of a person on the edge of sanity, a reality that few people who are sane enough (if anyone can be considered sane in this business)to get a film made would ever have experienced.
Finally, I must add that this film is an emotionally rewarding experience, providing a denouement that is cleansing and healing - a 'happy ending' that smacks of real life, not the strange and manipulative world of formula film making.
No, we are finally given a story that reveals just what is special of the swords Inuyasha and Sesshomaru possess and a third sword which belonged to the siblings father that is the trouble in the story..
It's a weird kinda sound that is made and works well enough to suit the mood of the film.
After an hour or so, I realized, that is just the way it is supposed to end, that could be a reality everywhere.
From it's distasteful opening of a gentleman committing suicide at the mere sight of Alyson Hannigan, who's wearing a lot of padding to make her appear obese, to an altercation on a mock-Skull Island in which sexual assault is rendered both an item that is something to giggle at and actually somewhat enjoyable from the female standpoint, Date Movie's pro-Fascist agenda is there for all to see.
The film's idea is that you can be beautiful, but only after a severe makeover in which your physical appearance conforms to what makers Friedberg and Seltzer would want Â they have an idea of a perfect man, as well, and that is in the form of the handsome, white, Aryan character named Grant Funkyerdoder, a character played by British actor Adam Campbell.
As gross and ridiculous as all that is, the worst is when some old woman is having a romantic dinner with a fake cat and later makes out with it.
It's a good sci-fi film that is definitely worth a look!
and that is for sure what the new generation dreams of!, However this movie shows the consequences of such a life in a funny, simple and well presented way.
The sad thing about this film is that they try to make it light and fun, but fail miserably in almost all its attempts (some of you may be familiar with the falling wedding cake scene that has been used as a trailer ...and even that isn't really funny).
This movie is one that is fun to watch kicked back late at night while eating nachos and drinking a beer.
At least that is what this VHS tape appears to be that I picked up at a local church rummage sale.
Whether it is a horror film, a sci-fi film, or even a Bergman avant-garde film, there needs to be at least a small strain of story carrying the viewer from point A to point B, if that is missing Â the entire structure of the film will collapse.
Despite Harvey Keitel, Viggo Mortensen, Thandie Newton, and a slew of British accents Â that is why "The Young Americans" failed.
It is a murky mess that is easily forgotten and should be avoided.
now here is a movie martial arts fans will definitely enjoy.i wish all of jeff wincott's movies were as action packed as this one is.i don't think you will be surprised to find out that the plot is nothing you haven't seen before in other b movies.but who cares about the plot in a martial arts movie.all us fans want to see is nonstop martial arts fighting and that is what you get in this movie.jeff wincott is awesome in this movie showing off some good high kicks to peoples skulls.this movie and martial law 2 are the best movies that jeff wincott has starred in that i have seen.this movie isn't as action packed as martial outlaw 2 but any martial arts movie fans will still really like this movie
Zhou Xun truly dazzles those in attendance as the genuine Nana, a character doing the actress far greater justice than the cardboard cutout silhouette that is Ming Ming.
Visually, this movie has some very creative cinematography that is quite captivating, and very revealing of character.
Not only that, it succeeds at both comedy and horror, and that isn't easy to do.
It is exceptionally rare for me to find a program that is laugh out loud funny - but this is it!!!
The special effects are great, lots of CGI of course, but even that is getting better and better, and now Spiderman jumps and action seems more real than ever!
I am not saying this looks like Lawrence of Arabia, but it is a great indie horror film, with actual character development, it takes its time, that is ballsy.
Matt nelson is amazing in his performance, I mean, the guy threw himself into this role and that is admirable.
Well Billy does (that is the guy who got it).
This new form is a beer drinking, candy eating, mischief machine that isn't above killing.
It ends up being a well-made movie that is fun to watch.
Sometimes, that is just what you need from your horrors.
This is a film you gotta watch with your buddies to get the most enjoyment out at night with it's crude humor, it's a B movie that is most definitely worth checking out, especially if your a horror movie fan.
I tried to indulge in Feast: Unrated, the latest Project Greenlight, umm...project from Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (co-created with Wes Craven, the horror movie genius behind the Nightmare on Elm Street saga and the Scream Trilogy--still one of the best mystery-slashers ever made, even with the degenerating quality and originality that is seemingly inherent in sequels).
There really isn't much more to it and that is where the beauty of this film lies.
Dante doesn't try to make his films anything other than what they are -- charming and wildly, wickedly funny -- and that is undoubtedly the key to the outrageous success of "Gremlins," one of the biggest box office moneymakers ever released.
My own Blog at http://freedemocrat.blogspot.com/ follows many of these intellectual threads and offers a vision of an alternative to the Neocon Ideology that is not the classic "liberal" ideology though most progressive ideals end up in the results.
Naturally what sounds like a subject that may seem boring to some on paper, is perfectly handled by Curtis, who inter cuts talking head interviews along with a mountain of archive footage that is funny, revealing and disturbing.
One character in particular is felt sorry for and that is the old lady.
I will admit to being a Grodin fan and maybe that is necessary too.
Some may indicate that Mr. Hogan was not as cheerful and compassionate as Glenn Ford's version but that is simply opinion.
All of the jokes are still funny, most of them are nearly identical, although on some he adds more, or does it with different emphasis, but that is expected.
("Question Mark") perfectly blends a scripted story with completely unscripted encounters to make a film that is definitely the funniest, most offensive movie in the last several years, with the exception of Borat of course.
Maybe that is what the directors Harz and Kennedy were trying to do, make you think a bit?
I think that everyone who wants to see a film that is really funny, different and will make you laugh and think a lot, they should see ?
And that is the beauty of this film.
There is wonder in all that is new and there is a beauty in what is foreign.
A lonely passenger of a bus arrives in a rainy day in a remote place in Marseille; he stalks, follows and rapes the gorgeous MÃ©lancolie 'Mellie' Mau (MarlÃ¨ne Jobert), who is married with a jealous husband that is a navigator of Air France and is coming back home.
The reason for that is simple, there aren't many shows that after five, six, seven or more seasons remain as good as the were at the start of their showing, but NCIS is only getting better.
Okay I'm really starting to get sick of these people who say that this show is a CSI spin off CSI is a bad unbelievable show that is totally fiction they can do forensics in 10 seconds when it takes more then 10 hours, its pure Science fiction CSI is but NCIS is closer to reality its always enjoyable, funny and I'm sure more people would watch it if they could not view it as CSI spin off/Rip off because its not watch one episode and you will see its more about the Federal Agents.
If that is your question, NCIS is one of your main answers.
Season 3 was a very ruff one, were mistakes and chance are all the time, 4 was just human, and 5... Well, 5 has not shown up yet down here at Mexico, but I have heard that is good.
There is simply nothing about NCIS that is not to like.
It is the subject matter here that is so difficult.
Two families in conflict over different reasons on the surface but sharing a similarity that is demonstrated as the story proceeds.
After meeting with the IRA in a scene that is almost comic, she meets with the high-ranking Brits, and there is an agreement that everyone will agree to a cease fire.
All it needs is the right story and some of the magic that is missing from most kids' films these days.
It is worthwhile to read the back of the box, that is worth a laugh, as it seems to have been written by a major stoner.
This is the kind of stuff that isn't necessary and certainly doesn't make the film any more interesting.
And for a film that is less than 90 minutes, that is something that a director, especially one like Greg Araki, who has made some amazing films, should definitely avoid doing.
Homosexuality also is a frequent concept that is brought up several times in the film.
I don't even care if it's just a casual occurrence in a film.But in this film, the concept of the boyfriend being gay, or the drifter being gay is simply something that isn't explored to any real extent.
Something that isn't open of discussion is the fact Araki created one of the meanest, most good-looking pieces of trash of the 90's!
the filmmakers leave nothing to the imagination and that is this movie's strong point in my opinion.
if you really want to check something out that is different but at the same time a good movie, check this one out.
The monsters and the special effects are not perfect and you can clearly see that is a doll in many of the scenes, but that's what makes the movie a trash cult.
and raising of eyebrow - that is too much of Hrithik and less of Akbar.
The second half of the film leads in something of an odd direction, becoming an intense action thriller that is at times jaw-droppingly similar to Spielberg's own "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom."
I have saved the best for last and that is Mr AR Rahman.
The contention here is the story behind Jodha, and the various names she goes by with different retellings, and that is put up front even before the opening credits start to roll.
Gowariker and his team have an amazing knack of filming violence that is simultaneously elegant and visceral.
Also the director's vision was to show the Mughal Emperor as a sensitive soul and that is what Hrithik evocatively brings about either in the vulnerability he portrays, while apologising to Maham Anga, or the passion tinged with restraint he exhibits when dealing with his distant wife.
It ebbs and flows with its own life and at places, the creators of the movie themselves lost control over it, and that is noticeable.
But one cannot blame them for that for that is the wont of any creative process.
Gowariker makes a valiant attempt at a film that is war epic, love story, and costume drama all in one, but never does "Jodhaa Akbar" approach the charm or finesse of "Lagaan."
The blurb for the film tells you it is in one sense a menage-a-trois story, but that is already giving away too much for my taste.
Apparently my city is the only city in North America that is showing this movie.
For it is this part of the story that is actually true.
What is extraordinary about it is that is does not pose any theories.
Conan knows what's funny, and he's got a wit that is unmatched by any comedian I've ever seen.
It is worth noting before watching that little of what you see playing out on the screen may be actually happening, and there may be something more sinister at work that is never fully stated in the film.
This leads me to Hide and Seek, a movie that is mediocre even with powerful actors like DeNiro, Fanning and Shue.
Well, that is my theory, cause she is way better than this garbage.
Mom kills herself in the beginning of the movie, or at least that is what it looks like.
I love the twist that is made at the end.
A compact, fast paced script that is based totally on character interaction.
It seems there is a $1,000.00 debt that is owed, and Brown can't face Meeker about it.
Some people might find Holmes's character a bit smug, but that is accurate to the stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
It is movie that is not just heartwarming but a shining proof that it is never too late for Philippine cinema to reform.
In my opinion, this is a film that is best understood if you are a native Czech, appreciate Czech humor and character, and like Bohumil Hrabal's "tender barbarian" style of writing.
2) The movie portrays a pleasant sort of fantasy Victorian world that is always fun to visit.
Adapted for the screen by Thompson herself, this is a fun and inventive kids film that is guaranteed to make you smile.
A few rude words and food fights to keep the kids (and parents) happy, oh and a dancing donkey, but overall a film that is lots of fun.
Deborah Kerr still had a great body at 48, and that is why I think she did not mind doing the nude scene.
In fact, Lancaster and Kerr perform a steamy nude sex scene that is a bit more candid than their famous 'beach scene' from the 1953 - it is rare to see a mature couple do these kinds of scenes and I applaud all people involved for handling it in a tasteful manner.
It is about respect for the people and the culture and the understanding that there is MUCH MUCH more beyond the borders of our country that is has a depth of history and culture much greater than ours.
It's difficult to find anything in this made-for-television adaptation that is at odds with the book of the same name.
A film that is well worth seeking out.
It is a very good way of creating a gripping storyline and that is the most important asset of the director and film's itself.
And she is suffering from this conditioned called "twin stigmata", kinda like the twins on GI Joe (You know, you have to hit one to hurt the other type of thing), which is how I know how to write my only crappy story about her cause deep down inside I know she exists, and that is also the reason that she is randomly losing limbs while she is poll dancing in a strip club where she in the only one who doesn't take off her clothes (of course flashing her hooha to all the paparazzi is totally acceptable, but parish the thought that she flash a teet and get paid for it) is because that when you cut them off my body it falls off of hers.
Enjoy living with your under aged stripper twin sister, because with the way you write your stories, that is about the only place you are going to end up."
There is a horrible over whelming sense of betrayal and the thought that they are going to ruin someones life forever, especially Camilla finds a house for him and Diana to live in - that is 20 minutes away from her.
A great little film that is just as brutal and vicious as any movie by Paul Verhoeven.
Yes its corny, yes its a bit pointless but that is what makes it so good!!
Enough lecturing, except to conclude...Yes, Grease is the word all right, if you want to send a teenager all the wrong messages, that is.
and that is why this movie is considered to be one of the best musicals of all time.
Paul: But that is not right.
To sum it up, 'Pardes' is a wonderful romantic drama and that is the reason it was appreciated upon release.
The thing I don't get is why child labour is frowned upon in every arena except that of entertainment, and the obscenity that is the Child Star.
I love this movie because it is part of AustriaÂ´s figure skating history that is unique in the world.
There's a decent amount of gore, including the previously mentioned fish-hook death, and a particularly decent leg-blowtorching-to-flesh-removal that is pretty choice.
The student of medicine Kim and her boyfriend Por that studies in law school, the student of engineering Ko and Noot that is studying English to move to Australia with her gay friend Tair decide to reunite and travel to the country for the ceremony of cremation.
Of course you will have to see it on VHS as that is the only format it is available in at the moment.
It's quite laughable and sometimes even ludicrous when seemingly uneducated, or at the very least, unknowing and uncultured individuals write a comment that is nothing more than trite, shallow, insubstantial, and crude in the hopes that they will sound intelligent or even worth reading.
"Excalibur" is filmed with great care and attention to detail in showing the transition that is symbolic of the Dark Ages making way for the new ideas and Christianity taking root.
I haven't seen any others so, maybe that is faint praise.
I think Wagner is used better here than in the chopper scene in Apocolypse Now and that is high praise indeed, because that is one of the most magnificent scenes in all of film.
Of course, while there's no concrete, verifiable record of Arthur or the other characters in this film, that doesn't matter; director John Boorman has created a movie that is magnificent in its scope, and vividly tells the Arthurian legend in entertaining style.
It is also characterized by fire and fog, shadow and moonlight, creating an air of mystery that is essential element in the Arthurian legend...  Boorman's 'Excalibur' is a mythical presentation leading the viewers to travel with the flow of the legend...
At one point Sir Percival represents all the questknights, at another Morgana is all that is evil.
The hallucinations within the scene one fantasy are perhaps the weakest part of the film, they are used as tool to keep a viewer interested long enough to see the film through and while the provide clues that nothing else that is happening is real or at least that there is some level of menatl issue.
This is a tough movie to review: almost anything that is said about it diminishes the impact of a fresh look.
Yes, there are some portions of the film that beg credibility but then that is what delusional thinking is about.
In other words, they are portrayed as real people living their lives that is not consumed by their sexuality even as it overshadows everything they do.
There is something that is particularly moving for me about his movie.
The business of the three sons, Arthur (Frank Albertson), Dick (Eric Lindon), and Tommy (Mickey Rooney), and the daughter Mildred (Bonita Granville) all helps paint a picture that is close to Norman Rockwell (although the apparently alcoholism of the uncle is troubling).
It is a finely made movie of MGM near it's height, but the source for all the pleasant humor of the piece has a long dark shadow that is unsettling.
And that is the tragedy.
I love the faded, preserved shrine that is Norma Desmond's house.
She is bound by reputation and profession to a type of film-making that is long dead and nearly forgotten.
But in the end, Sunset Boulevard stands out, as one of the finest examples of the frenzied circus of obsession, fixation, and greed that is oftentimes symbolizes Hollywood.
is clearly an ad lib that is so real and intimate that it is almost instantly lost in the macabre sequence that follows -- all flashing eyes and volcanic eruption that C.B.
The movie has some one of the most innovative scripts of cinema and that is certainly justified by the unforgetable and memorable lines captured from the film.
There are not a lot of `dated' themes in this film Â the circle of life that is Hollywood isn't going to be much more evolved in 2050 than it was in 1950.
But that is why I liked it.
So if you want a movie that is a little different.
Hightlights for me include: amazing, psychedelia-drenched sets and uber costumes that made me wish the 1970's had ever really achieved such suggested heightened self-awareness; acting done in the "Distanciated" mode advocated by Douglas Sirk but reinterpreted to new depths by Biller; a truly remarkable perf by Bridget Brno as Anna's best friend & living Barbie doll gone Bad Girl (but in a Good Way); and an animated orgasm sequence that is as sublime as it is subliminal.
Andrei Tarkovsky noted there are two kinds of filmmakers Â those who try and (re)create reality and those who create their own worlds; Biller is clearly in the latter camp, and she has to create a world because that is the only way she can get at the truths about relations between men and women, desire, identity, and the ravages of history on individual life.
Plus deadly serious feminist self-reflexivity for the unwashed masses and nude dancers with their wieners bobbing hilariously for intellectuals like myself, courtesy of a nudist camp scene that is exactly like Blake Edwards WOULD have done it in A SHOT IN THE DARK, if Hollywood censorship had already relaxed, and he was on angel dust.
Reuben, Reuben is an example of a relatively modern movie that is getting that age old treatment.
I have come to believe that many of these great movies are slowly being forgotten on some conscious level; we the viewing public does not want to remember the best, as it will make us realize the amount of dreck that is now released, and make us maudlin and mournful.
But that is just a pretext for a marvelous set of character sketches played by a marvelous cast of character actors served by a great character director.   
There is but one reason to watch this and that is to know how it was utterly destroyed.
There is a sudden twist in the story right at the end of the film that is bound to surprise.
The Aunt Jemiama stereotype that is put onto Delialah proves my point.
Today, of course, we feel that it is the sin of the society penalizing millions of non-whites that is the terrible wrong, not Peola's desperate attempt to grab at happiness.
She accepts her place in society (that is a personal choice, mind you) and aims to make the best out of it.
Delilah's daughter just wants to be an airhead too (that is a personal choice, mind you).
Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex is a success for Woody Allen if only for him being able to go through a whole host of satirizing that is always, if not hilarious, cleverly crafted and impeccably cast.
The highlights for me include the climactic (err, maybe pun intended) end sequence showing the inner workings (with Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds present in the control room) of intercourse; the faux game show involving sexual questions (and yes, that is Regis Philbin) with a truly belly-laugh of a finale involving a Jewish mother; best is the Gene Wilder sheep scene, which was my favorite when I first saw the film as a kid.
Maybe that is why he so ardently avoided any trace of humor in those later films, he realized just how easily they can lapse into self-parody.
But that is just their way of saying hey, I have become a sheep.
Still in all, it's Liza's singing that is the show's centerpiece, and she's in fine, clear voice throughout.
I have seen the movie and i can say that this motion picture is pure Croatian all thought money gave many all ex republics of former Yugoslavia for production of same.I know same of readers of this will think that i loved Serbian former politics but that is not true and this is not politics that i am writing about.In the movie you will see all the god and the bad things about the former homeland, beginning is full of the beauty of Yugoslavia and the end is going with the beauty of Croatian islands same can say OK it was nice but this is nice too it is far smaller but it is beautiful.OK never mind i like all ex republics but why going beck?
"Karaula" is a cinematic equivalent of those 1980s hammy pop-folk-rock-whatever-happens-to-be-selling-at-the-moment-that is-what-we-play Bijelo dugme clones (Merlin, Hari Mata Hari, Valentino, Plavi orkestar, Divlje jagode, Regina) - a populist, don't-you-dare-go-deeper-than-the-outer-layer, watchable but ultimately quickly forgettable experience.
And there's a second line of the story (that is a bit difficult for people outside the Balkans to understand - which is the reason for the words on the screen at the end of the film) - all the main characters are from different ex-Yugoslavian countries, but they are no different as people.
Cinematography was beautiful, DD.5.1 worked perfectly, maybe only a corny Hollywood ending would made me feel better, but if i think back on the movie, the one that is there, stands much better.
the bloody end of one country... that is shown in a very poetic and peaceful way.
It's simply a very good film that is definitely worth a buy.
A subject that is not easily tackled but the director, Brian Pimental deals with it beautifully.
Yet, "Tropical Malady" also brings a romantic tenor to the subject as it implies that the love between the two men has somehow moved into a more meaningful and primal stage, one bereft of the constricting and deadening rituals placed upon it by a civilized world (my suspicion is that is why the filmmakers chose to make this a love story between two men rather than one between a man and a woman, though, frankly, the Thai society we see doesn't seem to be particularly condemning or homophobic in its response to the lads).
I wished I would have paid more attention to Weerasethakul "Mysterious Object At Noon" the first time I had the chance, he has a talent for experimenting with narrative and style that is missing in many films endlessly praised these days.
It is a strange and haunting tone poem that is as multi-layered as the forest in which it is filmed and may require repeated viewing to fully unravel.
"Tropical Malady" has been promoted as a gay film, which in a way, it is, but basically it presents a mystery that is never solved, although we know that in this case, the soldier is so obsessed with his opponent that they end up respecting one another.
Denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie.
This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully.
Ebert describes it as a film that is "free of plot" That it is a film that doesn't have any final explanation and exists only as an "experience"  Weir says that he worked very hard to have the audience lose awareness of the facts.
It is a film that is intentionally obtuse.
A computer virus that is transmitted via a television (or computer monitor) screen and becomes a lethal biological pathogen?
There is a lot about this film that is cheesy, especially in the first half.
Like that isn't bad enough, it's the same tune every time.
The plot concerns a small, out-of-date railway that is due to be closed down and the local community's attempts to keep it running in the face of monumental adversity.
1) Gay Western Hare Krishnas wanna-bes looking to gain kung fu enlightenment at Shaolin 2) The Black Monk of Harlem, a buddy of the Shaolin Abbot, who does some serious butt-kicking, and speaks in a HK film dubber's approximation of 1970's jive that is unintentionally hilarious 3) The Ninja Water Spider Attack Team.
The DVD case is misleading in that it looks pretty interesting, but that is about it.
When children grow up among adults who refuse to recognize anything that is fine and good or worthy of respect, it's no wonder that ..." Yawn!
In fact it was sort of a relief when he would kill one of these bad acting idiots.This was a totally lame and totally forgettable piece of junk that isn't worth your time.
Special effects, if that is what they are suppose to be, are as good as any you can create at home yourself.
I know this is not for adults, but watch the Secret of Roan Inish, a kids movie that isn't stupid!
There's a moment of the movie when Benigni manages to reach the lowest Â an endeavour you had thought not possible after one hour and a half of the previous ordeal Â it is when he, very underhandedly, provides the viewers with a thick mist in order to veil, that is to hide, a pile of corpses of prisoners murdered by the Nazis.
Guido's goodness is not attributed to his being Jewish--that is something to be dispensed with quickly, as if it were an embarrassment.
They're easy to understand, have action that is a bit more believable (I said a bit more, not totally!!
Well, it was, and while I appreciate the nostalgic feel to the film, and the fact that is a slasher film through and through and knows its origins, the film, for me, was a huge let down for ONE reason alone: the character that we are suppose to sympathize with the most and who is by all accounts the main character of the film (Alan) has to be one of the most annoying characters in film history.
I just watched it 5 minutes ago, and now I want to put a gun in my mouth, to end the fail that is replaying over and over in my head!
How can we empathize with a character that is no better than his detractors?
On the other hand, if you are sensitive, please refrain from watching 'Return to Sleepaway Camp', because it's a major disrespect to the first film and it hurts a lot to see a sequel that is so incredibly inferior in every single way.
But that is not what I see this movie for.
Honestly, that is what I enjoyed about the film.
All of the romance that is supposed to touch you and bring you closer to the characters really just pushes you away because the scenes presented are so hard to swallow.
Younger never gives the characters real dimension or qualities that would make the audience draw towards them, so when the film ends, you don't feel the connection with the characters that is needed for the ending to be felt the way Younger wants it to be felt.
But Hollywood seems to abhor anything that is not either implausibly romantic or utterly hopeless.
It is a cultural phenomenon in Norway that is just as popular 30 years after its arrival, which was proved by the video game based on the film that became the biggest selling video game of all time in Norway: 25 years after the films debut.
This film represents ALL that is wrong w/ H'wood studio pics and the ego-driven dribble audiences just eat up.
It's about a tai chi master that is drunk most of the time.
It probably could have been a movie that is strange and disturbing and which make you think about humor and hope but sadly it's a movie which is strange, embarrassing and stupid.
Soon after leaving grandpa's house, the three annoying brats go with their friends to an amusement park that is about to be taken over by the lamest villains in history--Loni Anderson and Jim Varney as 'Medusa' and 'Lothar'!!
Of especial note is the second youngest as he sports a haircut that is so abysmally misguided it makes Billy Ray Cyrus's mullet look tasteful.
When I watch something that is listed as a comedy, I want it to be good and funny.
OK you see stupid bullcrap like that is what's ruining America.
i don't know maybe that is just me but yeah this show is just plain and simple unoriginal and not very entertaining.
He reverses his nice guy tactic and begins telling everyone he encounters just how he feels - and that is usually negative!
We do get to see a Wolfen vision sex scene that is pretty scary in itself.
Making a script that is the basis of an elliptical, action-free, blank-metaphor-full movie such as this one is again an argument to support the idea that sparkly credits (give us the Palm d'Or!)
And not in the `good' awful sense that is usually accustomed to low budget movies.
This kids got that is worth the world knowing about, so its a shame they've made such a bomb of it.
These hotel doors left ajar did provide for one point where I thought 'now the fun begins', and that is when Yella leaves her room and seeks out her companion.
Well, my husband and I are both avid EARTHSEA fans - fans of the books, that is ... this mini-series was so horrid, it was almost funny.
Oh one thing that I have heard .....I heard some rumors that they were thinking of doing a sequel, if that is the case I would gladly jump on board.
The movie is about 40 minutes long, so that is a plus because usually movies like this that are too long are hard to watch all the way through.
(It is not good enough to fall into the "so bad it's good" category, if that is any indication).
It is again Hollywood's way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humorÂof course, for all I know, maybe that is the general thought of teenagers, as many seemed to enjoy this movie.
that is always a cool thing.
but that is just movies, isn't it.
Unfortunately the main problem with Thirst is that is just so slow, boring, dull & at 90 minutes far too long & drawn out.
The stooges are launched into space, land on a distant planet and (after the usual stooge shennanigans, save the world from alien zombies (a young dan "hoss" blocker") The only reason i give this movie a 1 is because that is as low as the ratings go.
as soon as he gets tortured for the first time and they take his sense of taste away the viewer instantly knows what that is: his senses.
Perhaps that is true.
and that is saying a  lot.
So, the deck is stacked from deuce to ace, and that is why the film so completely fails as a work of drama.
A medium that kills because you watch it (in 'The Ring' a videotape, here an internet-site), a little girl that is probably the key to solve the problem, a woman and a guy searching for the answer, both saw the site and therefor they both have to hurry, and why they have to hurry has something to do with earlier events.
It was given to the viewer, and every episode you waited for him to explode........that is drama.
And all that is to say nothing of the illogic of the actual trial and methods of "defense" itself.
It does feel good because it has that angsty virgin thing who gets together with a gorgeous woman because of his ideas, and that is something we can relate to, but it's just not smart.
If that is why he is so perplexed about how to be happy, then it should have been a persistent look on his face, an explanation that is revealed as to why he does things so differently than the rest of us.
This is just one of those films that is completely beneath contempt.
I heard that is was because of Mischa Barton, that she wanna leave the show and make some movies.
And in the climax scene Collette does nothing sensibly and instead panics and acts out in a manner that is really uncomfortable and embarrassing to watch.
This is rated 7/10 by IMDb users and I think that is a gross overrating.
Then the movie becomes much more political with the intention to change the common view of sharks as a lurking predator that is out to get us.
Then we enter the battle against the illegal fishing that is going on in order to get the fins from the sharks to shark fin soup.
Some of the Emperor's verbal and physical non-sequiturs are amusing and generate some pathos from his situation but that is as far as it goes.
The only thing she's done on film that is worth seeing is Evita (a music video) and "Desperately Seeking Susan" (in which she has little dialog and rolls her eyes a lot).
This is not one of those movies that is so bad it is good.
This is one of those movies that is so bad it actually slingshots right around past good and right back to bad again.
I give this movie a 1, but that is only because IMDb will not let me input negative numbers.
I woke up one morning and saw that there was a new action thriller running called "Virus" I thought "yahoo" a movie for the international nerd, but when the movie started I soon relised that this wasen't a movie about a virus, but a horror thriller about a "electro" alien that is trying to take over the world using the help of half human robots witch it manufactures in a russian ship, a unlucky crew of a 5 stumbles upon the ship and tries to save the world from the evil alien.
Note, that is just my totally uneducated guess.
Jamie Lee Curtis does a serviceable job at best and gives the film's best performance, but that is not saying anything as virtually everyone else is just awful.
Instead we got the violence and hopelessness that is Thelma & Louise.
This is better than the movie it copies "Blue Lagoon", but that is saying very little.
This is all not to mention how stupid it is to make a film that is "based on a true story" that no one can prove.
If they both died, that means someone just took a complete stab in the dark at what probably happened out there while they were missing, which in the end really made me mad, because that is also what I predicted was going to happen, and if they both didn't die in the "true events", I think it was a poor choice making them both die in this movie.
At 90 odd minutes it feels long & the dreadful mixture of unfunny teen comedy & predictable murder mystery that is sub Scooby-Doo cartoon standard means I would recommend anyone thinking of watching this not to.
Her horrible warbling is exactly what the producers were looking for and back in 1934 it would have gone over quite well at the time--after all, she could sing, though in a style that is so out of style today that many will find the singing quite painful (my ears are still bleeding).
My final thoughts, If you want to see a movie that is at best, a C+ at SIU's sophomore film program, by all means watch it.
Most mainstream thrillers have something in their plot that is implausible, and this one is no exception- the everpresent killer, and that there is a Filipino who doesn't know what balut is.
In any case, this movie is worth viewing for its creative display of a complex subject- but with a caveat- this movie presents a picture that is not characteristic of all life in the Philippines- something few viewers will take into account.
The phone conversation scene was good, but that is just about it.
My partner and I won tickets to see the Sydney sneak preview so off we went last night (Monday 16th October)   Let me begin by saying 'that is 88 minutes of my life that I will never get back"   I was set to see a great Aussie flick; instead I found it mind numbingly boring, predictable 'comedy' (and I use that term lightly)   It was more of a reflection on a horde of has been 'comedians' (and I use that term lightly also) who have unceremoniously used their names and positions on radio stations around Australia to tout the movie as being the best thing since sliced breadÂ   Suggest you spend 88 minutes watching the grass grow than see this movieÂ   I think I would have enjoyed having my fingernails ripped off one by one followed by an acid bath more than that ghastly piece of 'Australian Film making'
BoyTown comes out as a convoluted mess that can't decide on a style, with jokes and a 'story' that is predicable and the worst ending in film history.
He played the part, but didn't build the character, and after all of it I still had the looming thought that Rydell left me with at the very end Â the "educated guess" which completely debunked the film Â but that is another story.
On top of that, Holly Hunter's character is given more weight than it should be for such a poorly drawn character, but that is perhaps due to Holly Hunter's starpower.
If you want to see a relationship movie that is thoughtful, witty, and charming, see High Fidelity with John Cusak.
The "society" that is formed in the train depot is about as generic and lame as anyone could ask.
But that is a matter of opinion and different people will have more or less patience with the film than I did.
If you are looking for a movie that is excruciatingly stupid, pick this one up.
This movie was horrible,and I pride myself on loving all kinds of movies,but this was just terrible.The actors were very good looking the actresses were pretty with cute little bodies,but goodness I would rather them put in a few uglies than to have a ucked up script and story line.These people CAN NOT act!OK who drops down and does the nasty in an unknown barn,with a buddy missing?Not even in the worst horror movies has this happened.The story makes no sense.But if you can get a copy with the bloopers at the end,those are pretty good.The best part of this movie was the bloopers.The unfolding of the story was way too slow,the plot DOES NOT thicken,the actors can not act,the music sux,there's no "boo moments" as my friend calls them,everything that is going to happen is so freggin obvious its sad.This was a TOTAL waste of production dollars.Someone suggested that this seemed more like a student film,but as I'm sure that person knows,student films have been so much better than this before,as he said,that is no excuse.I recommend to try it because everyone has a different opinion,but ewwww!
How that is possible, I have no idea.
In the part of the movie where the dog puts the disk in the computer that makes every other computer in the building explode with sparks that is just unreal, you can tell that the dogs paw is no connected to its body and is just a sock puppet.
I am a huge fan of japanimation and animated features in general but this film(if that is what you call it)is just a lame attempt at selling merchandise to young kids.
All in all, a boring and dull film, that is one of the worst animations I've seen.Sorry, but this is a 1/10.
So unorganized and unprofessional that is the guys I served with acted that way none of us would have came home.
I only care about the fact that he makes bad movies, with the sort of inane persistence that is mind boggling.
The movie is about as chaotic as war, but that is not cinema veritÃ©: Uwe Boll simply happens to be the cinematic equivalent of a shell shock treatment.
This was one of the SciFi channels better offerings (although that isn't saying much).
This is a film that is loosely derived from the Greek myth of Theseus.
Let me start out by saying that (a) I like the SciFi channel, and fantasy and scifi in general (those reading my other reviews might conclude that I only like French and Japanese films, and that is not the case) and (b) I do not have any bias against TV movies.
Save your time and rent "Jason and the Golden Fleece" or some other film that is at least a little entertaining.
I just kept thinking that 1968 Tunnel Rats was like a bad horror film where the goodies (in this case the tunnel rats)were being picked off one by one by the evil monster (the VC) in different and more nasty ways and the only mystery was who is the one that is going to survive?
The CO that is nasty to his men as a way of protecting them and preparing them for the nasties of war etc?
On the Cover of the rental DVD it said that is was one of the best movie some movie critic had ever seen.
But that was based on my emotional engagement, and that is relative.
Joe Hitchcock, that is.
Poor production values and a plot that is stretched way too thin to support a feature length film (even one with a tight running time of 72 minutes) undermine some interesting ideas and sometimes effective direction from independent writer/directors Don Adams and Harry James Picardi.
Heavy-handed but well-mounted, this early King Vidor film would have us believe that all that is needed to bring Christianity to cattle rustlers is to win their respect.
It does attempt an offbeat approach to a formula plot, but that is the only positive thing one can really say about it.
Some of the "going down into the basement" scenes are kind of suspenseful... but this is negated by the totally over-the-top blood and gore that is usually the next step.
It is about a family who moves into a creepy house that is haunted - not by a ghost - but by a psychotic killer who inhabits the basement.
You can deal with that is the acting and the atmosphere is good, but none of these were good.
Perhaps that is why I was so disappointed with the plot-less tedium that was Three Burials.
Without looking for theme, symbology and story that isn't actually there...
i wasn't expecting much and that is basically what i got.
Why did they change Derrick, using an actor that isn't butt-ugly?
So eventually, somebody had to make a time travel flick that is boring, and here it is, THE NEXT ONE.
Now that is bad.
Oh, all that is but one: the black kid, of course.
Now that is my opinion.
After each member meets at their destination, two guys come up and escort them to their final meeting place wherever that is.
The primary content and the 'tunnel rats' of the title refers to soldiers whom engage in activity you feel you'd have to be mad to partake in; an activity that is not about capturing or defending terrain; or searching out an individual alÃ¡ Apocalypse Now or Saving Private Ryan, but about clearing Vietcong tunnels located beneath the battlefields.
The tunnels, however, remain off screen and we know what awaits the group, giving us a position of power Â a position of power that is further emphasised when we witness entire scenes dedicated to the Vietcong, the American's enemy, one occurrence of which sees the camera crane directly below a Tunnel Rat to reveal a makeshift Vietcong war room.
The girls are all attractive and run around in swim suits, but that is really damning with faint praise.
You look for a way out of a 75 mile interconnected maze that is 2-3 levels deep.
On the bright side the kung fu was very well done and that is the strong point of the movie.
Instead of listing all that is wrong with this masterpiece, I'll just sum it up and save you the pain.
Now I did leave out a couple of details but that is essentially the movie in a (big) nutshell.
A girl who drools over expensive rings - I can't really put into words how little attractive that is.
But none of those mockeries of film come close to the disaster that is Cheerleader Ninjas.
and the only redeeming factor was the nudity which does not make up for all that is lacking in this movie.
He still lives with his mother and seems to think that is cool for a man his age to do that.
I think that is the main reason so many male reviewers on this site think this is a terrific film.
and you have a film that is chock full of holes.
As a matter of fact, it is not really comparable to any of the great westerns because it is inherently small and my bottom line is that to the extent that it is worth watching, it is because it was a sincere effort but that is the best I can do and it is faint praise indeed.
It ends on a whimper with the only response that is appropriate is "huh?"
I've read about this film before, & was interested in it despite the fact that most everything I read said it was bad....but I generally LIKE bad movies, that is, ones that have entertainment value other than what was intended.
Many of the Morrie-isms that he spouts sound like the babbling of someone that is unconcious.
For a movie that is supposed to have "about a joke every minute, and sometimes too many jokes for one to swallow", that's not a really good thing.
If everybody realizes they are making something that isn't that good, maybe they don't really work "just as hard."
If that premise seems like I am leaving something out, rest assured that is not the case.
It is filled with slapstick comedy and romance that is quickly interrupted with deep rooted conversations about abortion and the definition of life when Preity turns up pregnant.
Since the "living" dead girl of the title cannot speak when discovered by the two main male characters in an abandoned mental hospital, it is naturally assumed by the writer and director that at least one of the boys will instantly see the chained woman as a sex object, that is, after he kills her three times.
But then that is just about all it is is a story loosely based on real facts, as I perceive them.
He goes from a snarling, foul-mouthed beast to a real sweetie, albeit one with a hidden agenda that is revealed much too soon (see the film).
Unbeknowst to them, a Catholic priest was murdered in a confession booth that is now stored in the basement, and the man who killed him hung himself because of guilt.
There is no character development or motivation, so basically there is nothing here that is needed to make a film.
The first entry about Waldemar was Â¨The mark of the Wolfman (1967)Â¨ by Enrique Eguiluz , it was such a box office hit that Jacinto went on filming successive outings as Â¨Night of WalpurgisÂ¨, Â¨Fury of the WolfmanÂ¨ , Â¨Doctor Jekill and the WolfmanÂ¨ , and once againÂ¨The return of the WalpurgisÂ¨, Â¨Howl of the devilÂ¨, Â¨The beast and the magic sword(1982)Â¨ that is filmed in Japan and for the umpteenth time Â¨Licantropo(1998) and finally even directed by Fred Olen Ray in Â¨Tomb of the Werewolf(2004) with Michelle Bauer.
there is not one character in this movie that is interesting, in the least.
how about scenes with blinding, obnoxious flashing at a strobe lights pace, for a period of time that is too long to bear.
and that... that is the true magic of this film.
And that is most definitely not acceptable.
Not something that is haphazardly jumbled together by an inferior hack.
Enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist that is in UK custody.
This gimmick relies on a stereotype that is to far afield from reality to be satisfying.
Well if that is the case, than we need global tragedies more often because they really make the world think about life and become better people as a result.
After seeing the show I realized it obviously wasn't good enough for network television and that is probably why it ended up on TBS.
Yet there is one compelling reason to see this movie, and that is for the performances of Ving Rhames and Gary Oldman.
It wasn't until after I saw the movie on Channel 4 tonight that I found out something relatively important and that is that the source novel by Emile Zola was set in 19th century France and not sometime 20th century Yorkshire .
After the worst series of murders in a slasher movie and after dialogues and love scenes that are really bad, the movie ends with a "surprise" ending that is too silly to be credible.
The children Noah and Emma Wilder (played not too convincingly by Chris O'Neil and Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) open the box which contains some magical rocks, a seashell that allows them to hear things humans can't, a contraption that looks like a dead sea urchin and a stuffed doll rabbit that is the weirdest artificial intelligence to grace the screen since that stupid bear gave me nightmares in Spielberg's A.I.
So while the future awaits word on Mimzy's success or failure (that is that rabbits name for anyone that cares), the children run amok by communicating with arachnids, jumping on the beach like an extra from Pixar's The Incredibles and talking to the stuffed animal that represents futures only hope.
In original language (Hungarian that is), characters have the voices of some famous Hungarian actors who also appear in the movie as they were all digitalized.
Add an unimaginative director and a cast that isn't spectacular and you have a movie that really isn't worth bothering with.
There's nothing overtly wrong with either the values or the morals conveyed by the movie - unless, that is, one considers subjecting innocent and unsuspecting children to bad film-making to be, in and of itself, immoral.
Good aspects of the movie were that is was scary.
Why does a abandoned asylum that is barely standing because of fire damage need security cameras you ask?
Well, you're guess is as good as mine and that is just one of many things wrong with this film.
The film's main flaw is the fact that is is extremely boring and filled with extremely bad actors who are portraying annoying characters we could give a crap less about.
Then, some rather random caveman video is included--that is, until you find out they are VAMPIRE CAVEMEN!!!!
When compounded by adding tinted black & white stock footage as a plot device, a 50-cent plastic toy spaceship with a bic lighter for propulsion(I swear I'm not making this up), and a "Spectum Analyzer" that is clearly a caulk gun, it transcends the normally accepted standard of "so-bad-it's-good".
We have a mission-control that is run by a man and a woman and a bloke with a clipboard.
And for a person who loves entertainment that is wholesome and positive in its outlook, this one made me nauseous.
Yes that is Frank Gorshin.
Mind you, that is a children's movie.
Perhaps Bansali ought to learn from Eastwood.. if he gets down from cloud 9 that is...
Bob Shaye has produced dozens of movies, so he probably thought he'd learned something about pacing and the shaping of an exciting story that is true to its universe.
If I could go back in time I would go back to the beginning of Conrad John's lineage and smite his ancestors so that he may never make a movie such that is this.
Tooth and Nail is a horror movie that is neither scary nor interesting.
The leaders, Michael Madsen and Vinnie Jones, ham it up in a couple of brief scenes a bit more than the "standard" "Beat It" rejects, and while that is marginally entertaining for about 5 seconds, it hardly makes for a worthwhile movie.
It addresses a topic that is still untouched, in horror films at least, and is able to play off of human nature quite well.
While as a portrayal of a moment in time, time and the world continue after the show ends, no matter when that is, the end of this third season will conclude with only the vague prospect of maybe (and that's a BIG maybe!)
Enough from minuscule me; just watch, appreciate and try to save the incredible, always amazing, phenomenon (and justly so) that is "Deadwood".
If your interested in seeing a film that is well made and acted, I recommend the one done on Hallmark,which can be found on Amazon.
One day, on his way to work, Vishal meets Roma (Geeta Basra), a beautiful woman and that is where his miserable life begins.
On the acting front, their are just a couple of seconds when you would see some acting on the screen and that is by the warden.
Not that is has anything to follow.
Today a poser like Michael Knight would be bottled and beaten and not tolerated and that is just what the feminists would do.
This is David Hasselhof a person that is still on the T.V.
Jeff Ltd. was a terrible show with above all a terrible performance by the lead character that is what I remember most of all about this show.
It's a comedy that isn't funny first of all.
None of the characters are likable and that is okay because you can have a comedy show with unlikeable people but the characters aren't funny either.
How that is possible, one can only wonder.
The whole scene is filler, as every clue that is revealed is just not important enough to justify this travesty.
This is a shame, because this movie does have a couple of nice scenes (when the crew doesn't go wild with the camera, that is).
There isn't one single thing about this movie that is good.
The documentary cites money and 'it just feeling right' as the reasons for the reunionÂagain, these reasons are painfully dull and provide none of the insight that is the purpose of a good documentary.
Besides Amber Heard naked, the awkwardness of the film got a bit of my attention especially from the beginning but that is about it, didn't live through the 80's nor do I care, maybe someone who did might enjoy it or people that are fans of the book.
Something happens that is traditional of the Hays Code in the 1950's, where, even if it the character's don't deserve it, if they ruin the moral compass, say a girl is promiscuous, she must be punished.
For any movie, one should be able to say one sentence that describes what happens in the movie and that is known as the premise.
The type that is lazy and bland.
La Vie En Rose was popular in post war Paris, World War II that is.
The main problem with the film is a script that is banal, limited in historical validity, and concentrating on a single rather silly motif of a painters' competition.
What is frustrating about that is Kira has no struggle to speak of.
The gist is that there's a campsite that is overrun by raccoons, and they're not just any raccoons, they're raccoons with a taste for human flesh.
The film is terrible because it shares no feeling about the real world that is much deeper and wider that can be beyond the imagination of the poor director.
Ian McShane makes a groundbreaking performance in this series, depicting the real life bad guy that is Al Swearengen in astonishing style, he truly is a nasty piece of work in this series.
Overall the acting is cardboard, storyline tapering and a piece of claptrack that is an embarassment from start to finish.
As it was, Disney settled for neither ending, leaving me rather frustrated - that is, only as frustrated as I get from watching a movie that didn't do a whole lot character-building-wise, or plot-wise for that matter.
It involves two horror clichÃ©s: the end that is not an end, and the freeze-frame.
secondly, the water you showed is not the water they drink, you just chose a dirty pond for livestock and that is evident in your documentary as you showed the cleaner water they use for their laundry.
There is even less that is original in this film than in Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho.
I do like warning documentaries but they should tell the real problem and that is overpopulation.
Of course politics won't burn their hands on this problem because of the powers of religions but the real problem are Too Many People, that is why the wild animals are leaving, dying out, there is not enough space.
One thing that is highly irritating throughout the film is that the actors are always laughing or have big smiles on their faces when there is nothing funny going on.
Unfortunately, although the Tudors are doubtlessly a visual triumph, they are also a fiasco in terms of pace, dramatic development and characterization Â that is, the things that matter.
This is a movie with a nice story, but I've never seen De Niro's wonderful acting totally wasted as in this movie; his performance is good, if he acts to render a shy, dumb, introvert cop/detective that is somewhat involved in a small-mafia situation, but , to be honest, people want to see him cool, outgoing, self-confident..
Mad Dog doesn't catch the person and the assailant escapes, though I believe he is captured later on though that isn't relevant here.\ Murray's character as we learn is a top and tough Mafia Boss named Frank Milo.
However, Portia de Rossi is as cute as a button but gives a performance that is just bad, RuPaul is gross, Richard Dreyfuss is useless, and it seems as if almost every actor playing a minor character has never acted before.
However, that isn't the only reason.
So that is saying something.
Every so often you get a sequel to a really good movie that is even better than the original; sadly this is not one of them.
As "entertainment" it merely serves to perpetuate all that is bad about South Africa today.
In Full Metal Yakuza, violence and acts of revenge don't have any other meaning than to satisfy the gore audience and that is pretty sad for those who'd like to see Miike making more serious cinema all the time.
The ending involves a very nasty abusion scene of a female character and that is definitely too strong in a trashy film like this.
The film is high on its gore level and so reminds pretty much of Ichi the Killer, a film that is filled with cartoonish violence and blood plus sadism towards both females and males.
Full Metal Yakuza is far from his greatest achievements and ambitions and thus is not at all among his most noteworthy films, but that is understandable considered the film's speedy low budget exploitation money maker status.
The director is childish to think she can direct, since any good director would change lines, direct actors to react a certain way and frame the shot so that is not in a constant 3-shot.
It's fun, a moment of light parody that is quickly buried under the mean spirited actions of the lead and misery of his powerless victims that permeates this unctuous work.
Well made, solidly but unspectacularly made, and technically perfectly competent, but with a story and an ambience that is nothing new.
Terrible...awful...but not the worse...there is always Congo...where you want to make an ash tray out of the stupid monkeys head...but that is another rant...
If you want to see a good action space movie...that is brainless...see the motion picture classic and guilty pleasure Starship Troopers...lead by Doogie Howser...stay away from this piece of garbage that could of been shot in someones garage...
Such beautiful songs as "Lover" and "Love Me Tonight" would have been presented by Lubitsch in a much more entertaining manner... Mamoulian seems to have been obsessed with moving the camera around (as if that is what makes a good film) .... "One Hour With You" was directed by Lubitsch and released in 1932.
There is a pair of blue eyes from one of the two main actresses which are so beautiful, I think I would forget to breath if I saw them in real life, but even that isn't enough to save the film.
The minority of people watching movies are actors or authors or whatever, so these situations don't ring true and as the most annoying of all, Maggie Gyllenhall comes across as giggly and stupid, something that is sad to watch, given how talented she is.
Overall, it's a lousy, stereotypical movie that is a 4 out of 10.
Bonnie Hunt plays the narrator that is publishing Lee's book.
I recommend this movie based on 2 things, the performance of W. Earl Brown (Deedee Pfieffer is great, too) and the great music of Meat Loaf that is featured throughout the show.
Because I hope that somewhere in the big pile of crud that is Hollywood (or whoever produces these things), a pearl or a gem will prove to exist.
It takes itself too seriously, and that is a huge mistake.
But if nothing else even if Continuum is as much of a disaster as Ark of Truth at least it will show consistency and that is worthy of good mention I suppose.
For example, there is a slow motion shot where Cam is leaping away from an explosion that is so over the top that I laughed so hard the movie had to be paused until I recovered.
The film starts with promise then descends into a banality that is awesome to behold.
At top level all you can do to further build up your character is to grind, grind, and grind some more for equipment that is slightly better than what you already have.
The show is to be commended for attempting to educate viewers about little people and demonstrate how they are essentially "just like you and me", but that is also its downfall - for ordinariness simply hasn't made for compelling TV viewing since the days of "Father Knows Best".
This movie tries so hard to be heartwarming, adding in Family problems with the sure fire dad that is always too busy for his kids.
And that is what this movie was "Re-imagined" into my friends - PURE TORTURE!
In 1974 Rankin & Bass created a television special called "The Year Without A Santa Claus" that is considered a classic along with their "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" special.
With an all-star cast I would have thought it would have at least been decent, but that is not the case.
I think the director and writer were going for the opposite of the animated version, because that is what they got.
Not that I am opposed to adult oriented movies, I am a horror fan and rarely watch anything that is not rated R, but, as far as Christmas specials go... they are usually geared towards little children.
With just Wood showing potential, the rest of the cast with Chris Klein in particular produces an emotionless and petty display that is more wooden than anything.
The acting was good - what little acting there was that is!
You know, this movie epitomizes everything that is wrong in the movie industry today -- just stick together a bunch of good looking big name celebrities with tons of web sites devoted to them together with a hip soundtrack and see what they can pull off.
Why, oh why, in this day and age, are we doing a film that is such a lengthy and impassioned advertisement for teen smoking?
The "plot", which is virtually non-existent, is as follows: A group of people are growing marijuana on a piece of land that is owned by the government.
The killer and his motives are like something out of a bad "Scary Movie" clone rather than something that is attempting to be a serious slasher film.
There is -one- scene in it that is nice.
A completely self-indulgent project that is saved only by the performances of a few of the supporting players including Billy Dee Williams and Betsy Palmer.
Never have I seen a movie that is so dull, poorly acted, and incoherent.
All i got was the film that is out there....throughly disappointed.
There is one funny part in this film and that is when Will Smith tells Whoopi there is a white man at the door.
No - it is a true description of this film because that is the word that jumps to minds on seeing this film.
As many art historians fear, the transference of Chevalier's fabrication to the silver screen is sure to create misconceptions about the Vermeer legacy in the minds of those who are limited to the confines of contemporary awareness, that is, most of the population.
Normally I love Jodie Foster, but this film is a total misfire that is little more than a gender reversal on Forrest Gump.
But it has to be the most stupidly bad comedy film ever made, while watching the film you cant help but think that if the story was put in the right hands it probably would have been a good movie (with Jim Carrey in the lead and maybe David Zucker directing) but it is one of those films that is so dumb SO badly acted and directed that you actually cant help but laugh all the way through it, so does this make it a good comedy because its funny for all the wrong reasons?, NO!
is just another film that is a big mistake on his acting resume.
The movie was shot on some sort of video format, but not a home camcorder, mind you, so you know that issues of lighting will crop up.
I am suprised to read so many positive comments about this movie that is soooooooooo predictable and gets dumber and dumber by the minute ... especially near the end where that annoying girlfriend of Dorff shows up ... God, help me !
It then shifts to comedy (rather lame comedy that is) during the middle of the film.
The fights in the movie are done pretty naive, but there is one definitely good thing: it lasts 1 hour and 15 mins, so that is good, one cannot get bored so much, but that is too short for a movie, because the story is cut to a bunch of scenes which go one after another without cohesion, well thats my personal opinion.
(a la "The Producers" storyline) If that is indeed the intent (and it's probably painfully obvious to those in the know) then I have a suspicion that they may have succeeded.
Granted, this movie is so monumentally bad, that there isn't a negative review out there that is negative enough to be able to actually capture how horribly bad this movie really is.
A movie that is truly a blemish on Bollywood.
Once that is over, the picture takes turn for worse.
I don't think that is what education is all about.
No spoilers, It is hard to spoil something that is already rotten.
The first trouble that is instantly apparent is the weak, weak acting.
Apart from the kid who plays young Tony that is, some young fellow called Travis Krasser or somesuch.
It was a surreal experience that is somewhat rewarding, yet it was a total head trip.
It really is a routine and forgettable movie that is saved from being total garbage by a couple of good performances (Keith Carradine is no less than completely convincing as a mangy, sadistic psycho).
That lesson would be decent enough to take in except that in the case of Livin'Large,the lesson becomes heavy handed.Dexter,played by Terrence Carter,changes more and more and becomes more remote from his ghetto neighborhood roots as he becomes successful.When a realtor shows him around a new townhouse he is going to buy,and his girlfriend tells Dexter that she can see the old neighborhood from the townhouse and Dexter replies,to his girlfriend's dismay,"and that is the way I prefer to see them from",the movie shows how much he is changing because of success and not for the better.
Livin' Large tries to tell blacks,in a nutshell,that having too much success,being too refined in speech,dress,education,and manner,makes you white.It is a message that is somewhat clumsy to present to the audience.There is nothing wrong with success.There is nothing wrong is doing the best you can and having dreams far from one's position in life.Livin'Large would wish to sell the idea that if you are black,and trying to improve your lot in life,in being different than how blacks are usually seen and portrayed by the American entertainment media,is an idea filled with compromise,or "selling out",or "acting white".The film's makers,in this case,could not be more than wrong.One would not hate the film,there are some funny moments in it,but it is not quite the film one should reccomend to the general audience at large.   
Is there anything that happens in this movie that is NOT predictable?
building some kind of God-awful bamboo structure that is supposed to be a motel or bed&breakfast or something.
Empty characters, short boring plot, and no depth and that is exactly what we see here with Nearing Grace.
It starts off well enough and plays through the first 30 or 40 minutes as a black comedy... Then things get darker and not so funny anymore and that is when the movie begins to fall apart.
Grim Reaper is a really awful film thanks to a terrible script that is confusing, has a rubbish story & is as dull as dishwater.
There is only one way to describe this movie and that is that it is a complete waste of your time.
I was taken aback as that is exactly what I was thinking at the time.
Joan Collins leads a group of prospective buyers on a cruise to a piece of swamp land that is going to be developed into condos.
Wells writing a novel that is so inane.
Laughable 'sci-fi' that is a hoot.
But that is as far as the goodness goes.
it's really just a dinosaur of a film that is kind of bottom shelf from the 80's and has made it's way to the present day.
While it's of infinitely better quality than the T&A show that is Ghost Whisperer (who would've thought skimpy outfits + ghost mysteries would actually be boring), I still was not impressed much by this show.
Whoever wrote this needs to go back to school and learn some real engaging material, something that is more real and sophisticated.
LeeLee is as stinkin' BEAUTIFUL as ever, although that is not really relevant : ) Even the production and camera-work in and of themselves were very polished and well done.
Even though events take different turns towards the end, she still doesn't learn anything new, and the movie remains with the same shallow thought that is started out with: spend more, take risks and you'll be happier.
At least one thing is clear, Amy Redford movie making is immature and even that is a compliment.
I added the extra 1/2 star since the film did end correctly, that is, that school comes first.
And what I mean by that is watching it without the ultimate "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment this movie deserves.
If you edited out half the gaps between their words the conversation might actually appear to flow normally but since this was not done you are simply left with big gaps where audience members ( the smart ones that is ) will run out of patience and leave the room.
If you like dragons, darker themes and that isolation feel (like in Waterworld) and you like to think to yourself "that is the most fuel efficient helicopter" (you'll know what I mean when you see it) go then, see it.
"Robots" treats us to a pastiche of set pieces stuck together by a plot that is so clichÃ©d it's virtually impossible to put a spoiler in here because you've already seen it all before: Evil corporation, valiant naive hero, funny sidekick, "you're okay just as you are" theme.
"Reign of Fire" is a cheeseball special effects fest that is a great time killer if you have time to kill.
Come on... You were memorable in Divorcing Jack, unforgettable actually, hopefully that is not the case in this one.
If you see it in the $.99 cut out area, get it so you can complete your anthology for whichever big name that is in this picture that you love.
They simply did not speak the same language that is spoken today.
If any man wishes to be in charge, he will simply say "that is an order" and one must obey his order.
They go after everything that is human and they suck up energy...how ?
Don't forget the space-station and rockets on wires, the cardboard sets and the acting that is really Oscar worthy.
There is some comedy in "The Jewel of the Nile," that is colorful and energetic.
For nearly two hours, A WHISPER IN THE DARK sets its audience up to believe it is watching an old-school ghost story that is leading up to a definitive (perhaps revelatory) finish.
Ricci's performance is nothing to write home about although that is probably due to the lame script.
Finally, a post-apocalypse movie that is original, believeable, and doesn't have Kevin Costner in it!!
Verdict-  Save your $10.50 and put it towards something that is time better spent... like paying someone to punch you in the face to remove any suspicion you may have had regarding whether or not this movie was worth going to, or actually any good at all.
My husband liked the fight scene between Maggie Q and Jason Scott Lee, but that is about the only recommendation I can give it.
There are some talented people in the film and they seem to actually try to do their best with material that isn't even fit to be called substandard.
Unfortunately, that is the reality of working as a temp in an office!
I DON'T WANT TO BE BORN stars Joan Collins so right away you've got a problem since Joan Collins is unable to play any character that isn't Joan Collins .
Since that is unlikely, I am thankfully done with any involvement with this pitiful failure of a film.
These would have to be the only two pluses though, in a film that is just too corny and stupid to be considered entertaining.
This story is supposed to be funny but it is not, not even because of the bad language used that is supposed to be funny you can really laugh.
I'm a fan of well endowed women, but that is just a bit too much for the average man's liking I would suspect.
Here's a hint, he's in a profession that isn't exactly unknown for its use of marijuana.
Too much happens, especially when combined with the hormone cocktail that is puberty.
they are all really shallow and spoiled and whiny; kind of like those rich Disney girls must be in real life, so that is why i don't understand how the acting sucks so bad because probably they are just playing themselves anyways.
the music is nothing good or special but its so much easier to just cut into some dance video than have a script that is worth my time, so that's what happens in this movie.
Similarities include (but are not limited to: a homemade flamethrower, a chest-bursting monster, lots of drool, a pair of engineers- one black, one white, an aging male captain who is somewhat heroic, a tense scene in something resembling air ducts, Creature reproduction includes humans, and a pet that is orphaned when its owner is killed.
Otherwise, his character is totally wasted in the story and has a far bigger role than that is necessary.
I missed the part that explained why they begin eating people, but that is just what they do.
He is not charming, not handsome and he lacks the inner turmoil that is very much a part of the character.
The story of Candyman is taken deeper but that is just about all that FAREWELL TO THE FLESH has going for it.
I think it's now in public domain, assuming anyone would ever care to seek out this film that is so dull and lacking of anything that might make it worth watching.
Where The Crow had dark, brooding, Gothic brilliance, with a classic and memorable score, this movie failed at everything... except at being bad, that is.
Old men tend to make art that is shallow, imitative of their earlier, better works, and which would never garner an ounce of praise were it not for their backlog of greater works somehow letting their patina still rub off.
RENT has the sort of timeless banality that is purposely built into TV sitcoms so that they can play eternally in reruns; if the dialogue didn't mention what year it takes place, it would be difficult to tell.
But it is the type of diversity that is only skin deep; none of the characters stand out as unique individuals; they are diverse for political correctness sake.
The idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, mutated into a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded OK even for 1985.
Although that is never really explained.
He is telling the story in a Princess Bride fashion to Joshua, an ugly little boy who is the best actor in the movie and that is not saying much.
I've never laughed so much at something that isn't even trying to be remotely comedic; it's a travesty.
I had a strong feeling that I'd be criticising this film for length before going into it and quite why Herschell decided to make this film this long really is beyond me; it's not even like the plot line is stronger than his usual fodder and all we end up with is a film that is more stretched out than usual; not a film with added 'good bits'.
If I remember correctly, after watching it the MST3K group said that it was worse than any other movie they had ever seen except for "The Castle of Fu Manchu" and that is was AS BAD AS that movie.
It's not often you get mummy/alien hybrids, but that is what this film is.
But this that is sort of like Tootsie in reverse, was not as funny.
AGENCY is another of those Canadian-made pictures posing as an American film, replete with big-name U.S. actors, and featuring Montreal unconvincingly standing in for Washington, D.C.  With a premise that is more intriguing and timely now than ever - subliminal messages in TV ads - one would have wished for a sincere, thoughtful approach.
Her defiant, mercurial, and headstrong nature that is evident in the book is not carried through in the movie.
"The Best Man" towers as a four-star romantic comedy in the tradition of "The Big Chill" with characters who never get short-changed and an ending that is agreeably believable.
There was not the special chemistry that is required to make this work.
But this film is so anti-marijuana that is tells us that it is much worse than heroin or pills.
), and the typical "Oh you're so out of step" gags ,and throw in a few "old guys teaching the new pups a lesson" gags , and you've got a confused stew that is neither comedy nor drama.
This is very reminiscent of "Le SoufflÃ© au Coeur"--another French film that is adored by most "with it" people.
I know that is the point the film makers intended, but that still doesn't mean I have to like it.
Is it possible that there is a correlation between the increased "awareness" of the media on the sensitive issue of sexism which their policy makers seem to believe can be dealt with by ruthlessly crushing any reference to the female sex in a comedy programme that is not totally adulatory,and the increased amount of disrespect and violence shown towards women in society in 2006?When Reg Varney made some outrageous remark to a large-bosomed bus conductress was he perhaps exorcising vicariously some deep need in the male members of his audience to do exactly the same thing themselves?Robbed by the self-appointed arbiters of public good of the opportunity of such relief,the nagged,the hen-pecked or the simply inadequate become more and more frustrated, sometimes with tragic results.
Speaking as a big fan of Dicken's cherished Christmas story, I am amazed that it is possible to go so wrong with a movie based upon it, especially one that is actually fairly faithful to the content.
Instead of it being a moving scene, it all comes across as a melodramatic and silly gimmick that is more comical than anything else.
This is a comedy that isn't.
She seems very sure of herself, but we understand that is only on the surface.
If the word incredible didn't have such positive connotations, that is the word I would use to describe xXx: State of the Union.
As long as the action sequences are well made that is.
Lemming is a slow moving, lifelessly acted "suspense thriller" that is shooting for something higher with the ambiguous presence of the title character.
For me though it is a contrived distraction that is unable to save this turgid Chabrol like (I apologize for being redundant.
But man, Gen X Cops is like that car that is totally blinged up on the outside.
This is a weak and overlong action flick, that is filled with clichÃ©s, and it's a movie that seems to be set on autopilot.
I think there might be one scene where he throws a karate chop to a guys throat and that is it.
Now the Donovan's have plans for a nuclear weapon & the equipment to build it that they intend to sell to a bunch of Russian suicide bombers who intend to become marters when they blow Los Angeles up, that is unless one-man army Cold can stop them...
This is indeed a special show that is continuing to pave the way for the facts of our history to finally be told with truth...Instead of the whitewashing we've seen our whole lives to make us feel better about ourselves.
Ebert says it involves somes legend, what that is I don't know.
The positive reviews are all written by people who have NEVER  reviewed any other movie (that is never ever a good sign) yet it has a high score?
When Derrida answers (he's frequently annoyed answering such general stuff) there is an obvious follow up question each time that is NEVER asked.
The objective of deconstruction is to de-center, that is, to identify the center of the argument--or of the proposed truth--that it relies on in order to make its case.
that will only be interesting for fans of Derrida who want to see a little bit of this man's personality -- and even that is limited.
I often wish that someone would attempt a version that is truer to the original book, even though it was penny-dreadful claptrap.
Using top professional actors like Forrest Tucker and J. Carrol Naish as bad guys, obviously helps the piece, as does having the genre legend that is Randolph Scott as your ebullient good guy, tho Scott fans who haven't seen the picture should be advised he isn't introduced into proceedings till the second quarter.
The characterization is paper-thin, though that is perhaps understandable given the number of characters.
Shaw, a pretty credible actor, seems to have realized how farcical this effort was and got into the spirit with a performance that is by turns lackadaisical and hammy.
I never knew that is possible for the moon to stay full for extended days on end.
It's just too strange to watch a movie that is based on the real-life tragedy of people I know very well, especially when some of the facts and scenes are altered.
The only aspect of His ethnicity that is pertinent is the fact that He was Jewish: because, according to prophecy the Messiah was be of Israel and to be king David's heir.
If that is true why, in the next scene, is she auditioning for a spot in Bill's club???
There's a production number supposedly being shown on a primitive television set that is gobstopping: Chorus girls dressed mainly in bandanas and bananas dance and stomp about telling us to "flip your lip, I'm a bangie from Ubangy."
Matlock...the answer to everything that is wrong with old people's TV shows.
It seems the producers of this film thought they needed to alter the Bible in order to make a story that is anti-racist, and promotes racial harmony.
Not much to say outside of the synopsis, but imagine Carpenter at his worst, and it only begins to describe the debacle that is "Prince of Darkness".
In any given year there has to be one show that is the worst of the lot, but this show may well hold that distinction for the entire decade.
If that is the case, great.
Well, usually that is, since this "SS Experiment Love Camp" is an utterly boring mess!
For 1985 I guess that is where the money came in.
Not only the lack of character explanations but these new characters are simply put; murder dolls Â as I said, this is Friday the 13th though the only problem in saying that is that these teenagers don't have sex, smoke drugs, drink alcohol, be naked Â nothing.
It's a rush job that is sloppy and lazy written and often feels and looks like a B-movie, with some bad pacing, ineffective build-up and lame characters and acting performance, also due to its writing.
Is there anything that happens in this movie that is NOT predictable?
Yet another appalling screenplay that is far more painful than any brutality inflicted on screen.
No eyes should ever witness the abortion that is Broken.
The players are somewhat hindered by their clichÃ© laden lines, O'Neal being even more encumbered by a large assortment of electronic and other specialized equipment that is magically available for use in situations requiring derring-do.
A movie can be bereft of many redeeming qualities but as long as it doesn't really do anything that is blatantly wrong, can it be all bad?
It is an excellent story, about a woman, who has a life that is going nowhere fast, and has little prospect of so.
All added together there are the standard parts for a thriller: a villain that wants a lot of money/power/whatever, a victim that is to help him, and a number of victims that are used to make the other victim help the villain.
Poor Harrison Ford, looking like he hasn't slept in days (and this is BEFORE his family is kidnapped), seems to sense that he is indeed at the nadir of his career and thus turns in a performance that is so lacking in energy and interest that he seems more bored with the material than we are.
And for a thriller that is meant to be taut, this one's awfully loose and riddled with coincidences, no more so than in the climax.
Just my 2 cents for all that is worth!
This plot (or similar) has been done so many times before that is't tiresome and boring in and of itself.
There is an element that seems realistic and that is the acceptable number of henchmen who are employed by the leader.
Despite this, director Richard Loncraine has crafted a film that is best described as what a computer would spit out if the command was: thriller.
Whether that is a good thing is up to the viewer.
I suppose a couple of moments work in the film, but I am guessing that is by accident when compared to so much else that didn't work.
Lightning strikes multiple times; people keep bragging about the quality of their mobile phones; a farmer and his wife aboard a tractor burst into a lively lip-sync of 'I Will Survive'; good Samaritans keep stealing things; a doctor tries to end his life; cops simply can't get a break...this movie is full of seemingly random events that somehow crazily knit together to bring us to the end that is the beginning (possibly).
Sadly, that isn't the case.
In summary, this was one of those series that is worth having on whether perfect or not.
In 5 seconds she gets killed by a falling cage, now that is comedy folks.
MKA however became a pastime for us at University, when we were in that frame of mind, to throw it on and laugh ourselves silly with the absolute shambles that is this film.
In fact, there will be several so if you continue, do at the risk of ruining the wonderful cinematic experience that is MKA), robots from game 3 come in, negating the fact that their sole purpose in the games was to hunt Sub Zero, a character killed in the first movie.
However, it soon becomes apparent that this is a largely pointless film that isn't going to go anywhere.
Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film.
In a minor sub-plot, we follow the sheriff(Nathan Anderson;the one looking for the loot that is supposed to be his share)and Ivan's psychologist, Margaret(Fiona Loewi)as they are trying to find Ivan.
You get home, start watching it, only to find yourself being sermonized by some low-budget evangelical propaganda film that is nothing like what the cover suggests.
And the gore that is there is so generic and "seen a hundred times" that it's really nothing to get excited about.
James Woods' actual talent only serves to accentuate the bear-wearing-a-funny-hat that is the rest of the movie.
Also, this movie offers a rare chance to see Michael Rapaport rape someone on screen (that is, outside of a courtroom environment.)
Innovative but horribly done movie about an astronaut forced by thugs to seize an asteroid that is literally one huge diamond rock.
"Strip Nude For Your Killer" of 1975 is quite far away from being a Giallo-highlight it is definitely a film that any lover of Italian Horror should enjoy, and that is especially recommended to all the friends of the sleazier kind of Giallo.
In typical slasher fashion, The Last Horror Film opens with a nekkid blonde being murdered in a hot tub, but, in the first of several plot twists (there is a double whammy right at the end), this death is quickly revealed to be a scene in a film that is being watched by Vinny Durand (Joe Spinell), a sweaty, lank-haired, delusional low-life who, infatuated with horror-star Jana Bates (Munro), travels to Cannes to try and convince the actress to appear in his non-existent movie.
There's just no tension that is necessary for a good Giallo.
There's also a love triangle going on that is dull in the extreme.
What I saw was a movie that is food for termites.
i wish axlerod would've been the bad guy because that is an awesome name for a villain.
It's not even one of those movies that is so bad it's funny - it's just plain bad in every way - the plot - the script - the cast - the effects - all terrible.
The film is definitely over the top and silly, but that's the reason I watch Giallo, so criticising it for that is ridiculous.
I give this 4/10 and that is only because of Lucy Lawless.I will always be a Lucy Lawless fan and anything she is in deserves some sort of score.
of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
The film begins on board a space ship bound for the moon that is captained by the great Sonny Tufts.
Solstice has a nice production, but that is it.
This results in a confusing film that is short on mystery and long on ridiculous coincidences.
Perhaps Norman Jewison is Peter Mayle (A Year in Provence) to the Emile Zola that is Frederick Forsyth.
All in all this is a film that is a let down on so many levels.
Wesley Snipes play the part of an ex-soldier that is going to marry his girlfriend, but, in a bar, he is confused with another person and a group of traitors to CIA inject him a powerful drug that mixes reality and memory.
When he dates with his girl-friend and Scott's sister, Detective Amy knight (Jacqueline Obradors), in a dinning restaurant, he is mistakenly taken as being the CIA agent that is investigating the robbery of the military experiment EX by a man called Sullivan (Stuart Wilson).
Attempts to provide credibility to the story that is acted out by adding "eye witness" statements of some "friends", fellow actors and even Nathalie's sister Lana cannot take away the aftertaste that this is just another "movie of the week".
In the space of only a day, I have managed to see two of the fifty films listed in "The Fifty Worst Films Of All Time" by Harry Medved (a classic book that is now, unfortunately, out of print).
Cammille is our pilot, following an emotion and feeling that is never quite developed in the story and therefore never quite developed in her.
But that is where it ends on any sort of creative levelÂ.
All the scenes draaaaaaag on and on and on and on.. the blame for that is that the so-called director is also a wanna-be editor.. an awful idea all together.
While gore fans will be pleased by some of the effects, that isn't enough to make it a decent horror film.
At the end of each sequence, the waxwork is completed (using a nice edit that is the only thing I can applaud in this movie).
The exhibits include the werewolf, a vampire, the Marquis de sade and an alien that isn't really explored.
And it is an annoying voice that is.
Example of bad thought out ideas --- Bad guys use a GPS, that does not work correctly and has nothing to do with a car bomb that is triggered with a cell phone --- DUH!!!!!
Just as Sir Alec Guinness shuddered for being immortalized by the wretched trash that is and was "Starwars", so did Ms. Morehead at being most-remembered as 2nd banana on such drivel as "Bewitched"...Bottom line, this DVD is worth the ride just for being an out-of-place-in-the-wrong-period, period piece...
Thought I caught him uncredited in Vanilla Shy but that is some years later.
He also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry.
In addition, someone gave them a song to sing that is among the most UNINTENTIONALLY funny and obscene songs ever written--as they repeat the same word AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN--in fact, this is the entire chorus (it's a euphemism for BOTH a cat and part of a female's anatomy).
The other thing that is wrong in the movie is the way the musical numbers are presented.
Unfunny with a sense of humor that is off four ways to Sunday this movie elicits the gag reflex not the laugh reflex.
Why do a remake that is even more cheesy than the original?
Hey, that is the exact same plot as CATWOMAN!
Throw in unending closeups of meaningless dialog, a "surprise" ending that is so ridiculous, it will leave you wondering if it didn't come from a different film, and other trivial nonsense that does nothing to explain this confused mess.
& O, instead seek out "Suckers", another low budget crime drama centering around a used car operation, that is absolutely brilliant.
Seeking frivolity in cold-blooded foreign streets, they end up being exploited to an unimaginable extreme and on a level that is unbelievable even in today's real world of sex tourism, pirates and child predators.
Here, sadists have ceded their place to wealthy psychopaths, especially German-speaking men, who pay to "get their medieval freak on," that is, if one can get medieval, by definition, with a chainsaw or acetylene torch.
But they soon learn that the hostel is nothing more than a front for a bizarre club, where people can pay a huge fee to get to perform unspeakable acts...  My 2 cents: The director and writer Eli Roths biggest accomplishment before Hostel is Cabin Fever (2002) - weather or not that is something good is a matter of personal judgment.
The movie is an hour and a half long, and takes a whopping 50 minutes to get to the place that is supposed to be the scene of terror and creepiness.
Everything that is wrong with "Hostel", was done right in "Wolf Creek".
The script for this must have been about one page long, as that is how bad the plot and storytelling here is.
His performance is the only one to have any real resonance at all and even that isn't very much.
The gist of the story - a young woman (Judy Davis) accusing an Indian of raping her in the cave - doesn't happen until halfway through this 163- minute film and even that is under question because nothing is ever shown.
Midway through the year, we would run out of movies we had actually heard of, and instead began to rent the most horrible looking films we could find (that is how we found Altered States).
It's probably because that is what struck me from the very beginning, particularly when there is so much going on in the opening sequence.
I notice that these four are also never in the tabloids and don't get caught up in the typical Hollywood tripe that is so prevalent today.
Anything that is seen either in the past, present, or future has a reason for being there and will be intelligently explained.
It is a romantic comedy that is not that funny and not that romantic.
The meat of the story, that which gives it it's real punch, is more or less totally missing, but that is what gives the story its bite.
Usually, this is a WAY under-rated movie, and that is because it is the kind of movie you will watch for the story and not just the sex.
One has the feeling that the film is biographical, and--now that Mr. Butler has a book out by the same name--I guess that is true.
I only recommend this if you want to watch a movie with friends that is so bad, it's actually funny and you can have fun laughing at it.
Why try to fix something that is not broken.
I better go upstairs and see what that is!"
Only one performance in the film has any merit to it at all: John Wood as a lonely old queen who is the lifelong protector of Beckinsale manages some genuine pathos, and as that is the only wholesome emotion visible in the entire film, one notices it.
If only the film knew what it wanted to be: There's one dynamite scene where the captain returns to pester the old witch and actually slices her skull in half, providing a great barf-bagger moment that is in stark contrast with the rest of the film's somewhat lethargic pacing.
This is a far from engaging episode that is, at times, embarrassing to watch.
Despite acting that is generally good, I found this to be the least satisfying version of the Joan of Arc story that I have ever seen, and I've seen most of them at one time or another.
All in all, this is one of the more unusual films I have seen--with a plot that is so unusual and a style that make it a standout film.
For instance, at the end, where Richard marks out a door - the Marquis opens a door that is an entirely different shape from the one Richard marked out.
Now that that is out of the way...
"The Giant Gila Monster" opens ominously enough with sinister music but quickly turns into "At the Hop", at a pace that is repeated enough times in the movie to keep you off balance.
No, that is an entirely appropriate reaction.
SPOILER ALERT: Worse still, the "killer" that is terrorizing the females (the detached penis of the protagonist), is never related psychologically to its owner, so that an opportunity for discussing male violence or a split between the civilized and savage parts of male desire, is missed.
Indeed, the claymation penis is the only character that is given a personality.
I watched this because it was reference in a similar film, "One Eyed Monster, but have to agree with the poster there, that was a far superior film, and that is not saying much.
The acting is good, the screenplay is hilarious, the fx are quite good, the characters are funny I especially love the "Santo" spoof), the best in show is Joaquin Cosio ("Mascarita"), of course its not the best of the movies but its entertaining and that is something everybody likes right?
The only thing that is so called offensive is the freakish incestuous son.
as she said many times, will be too often a result for many women after seeing that movie, when that is the stupidest thing they could do, not warranted and not beneficial, thinking life is better without men altogether.
One star a guy nobody has ever heard of and a plot that is pretty much an excuse to tell jokes.
My opinion of the movie would be lukewarm and shallow (the opinion, that is; OK the movie is no continental chasm.)
Almost immediately, Cher gives Walt a job, but their relationship is soon tested as they continue to live in L.A.  As I said earlier, the Farrellys don't know what to do with all of their material that isn't offensive, and since the essence of them is in their ability to offend people, they don't have anything up their sleeves to show us.
And all that is true in my opinion.
It is missing Kevin Bacon and some of the character chemistry that worked so well, but it stands as a movie that is easily watchable, and often funny and thrilling.
The first thing that is noticeable about Tremors 2 is that it has the look of a theatrical release.
I have never thought the term "addict" was appropriate for those who are unable to control their sexual behavior, but that is the least of my reasons for disliking this narcissistic semi-documentary.
Perhaps this is an extension of his prostitute fetish (that is, he believes that by paying them he owns them somehow)?
People will often dismiss any movie that is well crafted by comparing it to another movie that's well crafted.
Finally, it's very remarkable the use of f/x for the car-chase scene filmed in the Estadio Azteca, supervised by people in charge of effects for "Matrix", that is the most expensive scene ever done in Mexican Cinema's history and by the way, the best Mexican action film.
Yes, I came from my university's greek system, but that isn't the reason I think this made-for-TV flick was total crap.
It would be easy to say that this low budget thriller just doesn't work and then point out the obvious flaws but I think it's incredibly sad to watch any actor that is even remotely well known appearing in something so idiotic.
Unfortunately, this crass production falls into the latter camp and, despite some good talent and a serviceable script, the movie is betrayed and let down with an overabundance of (blatently obvious) body-double nudity (that would seem more in place in a soft porn production) and a (supposidly) "surprise twist' that is telegraphed early in the movie.
So every tot of me, that is begot of me, will go to Pot, Pot, Pottawatomie".
or so and acts amazed, I know that is the only emotion he can act out but it does get annoying.
Therefor this movie can perhaps be better seen as a special you would normally see on a DVD, that is paying tribute to a past away actor.
Clouseau is not found, that is a mystery for the next movie to solve.
Yes, Athena Massey is nice to look at, but that is the only positive thing that I can say about this disaster.
There is a scene that is a clone of the famous Before Sunrise scene where the protagonists hear the song "Come Here", by Kath Bloom, and exchange furtive looks towards one another.
But sadly, he's acted in a LOT of B-Flicks, and this is the BIG one, BIG-FOOT one, that is.
However, the film's direction breaks a fundamental rule of horror/thriller directing and that is showing too much too soon.
Eric Rohmer, the great filmmaker, tries his hand at the kind of film that is everything that a Rohmer film isn't.
It is very hard to balance the ruthlessness that is the basis of mob life with the light-hearted antics one wishes to see in a comedy.
So you are in this movie-rental place with a horror section that is just miles wide and furlongs in length, and you are, just imagine, scanning the rows for anything that catches your rather jaded (maybe from too many low-budget or low-brow horror flicks, too much mockery, or stilted dialogue, too many effects or musical stings) eye in that special way that only a truly mongoloid flick can do--and what do you see?
and what can you do or say (except fall in love with it on the spot and say "I love you," respectively associated, right there in the orchard of neon horror that is the movie rental place)--and then so imagine your heartbreak when you get home, undress it from its plastic case and discover to yourself the fact that it is completely: affectless, toneless, actionless, heartless, penniless, paceless, plotless, heartless, and, perhaps most horribly, humorless--you and your best bud cannot, for the glory that the world holds, come up with a single joke to combat the ceaseless waves of offense to your senses and sensibilities that this offers--not to mention devoid of a) evil and b)seeds of said evil...there are no effects: it features untold minutes of floral footage, which cause the actors to expire at completely surreal and random moments--with which occasional happening you can utterly sympathize...I went looking for a movie too bad to be believed, and I found it.
Sex is only the external layer of a relationship, and the most superficial of all, it hides rather than it represents what the man and the woman in the couple really are, and it takes special circumstances and dialog for the truth to pop out - this is the essence of the story that is being told.
You really can't go into any post-Hellbound sequel expecting anything resembling a good film, and that is truer than ever when it comes to the ones directed by Rick Bota.
Vega injects a nice quality into Flor that is at once unselfish and proud, as Flor exhibits true backbone to her employers.
Maybe that is the fault of my Western linear thinking, brought up short by Mel Gibson's Australian background.
Cheaply made film noir with a cast that is mostly unfamiliar faces.
The dialog was made of one clichÃ© after another suitably punctuated for effect such as when Walters (Luana Walters that is, here credited as Susan) announces to her husband Dixie Logan "Even if you were framed I know now that you're ROTten" (emphasis on ROT).
The westerns of the fifties had a certain cheerfulness in them, even when the story was sad, and that is what is lacking in this film.
The slow pace is also mentioned, but this pace is nothing compared to Angelopoulos' amazing work, so again that is not what failed for me.
I mentioned the taxidermist, one who preserves the dead in a life-like state, and the other passengers are those who can be seen as people who are chartered with protecting and/or killing other people, but when it comes to a single person, that is more trying.
I am 100% sure that each and every scene and detail is well crafted out in the script Â word by word, image by image, page by page, and that is reflected on the screen.
What's sad about that is that the writer (also the producer and director, as I mentioned before) is Indian and Hindu also.
Two un-funnier human beings I've not seen Â unless, that is, you find humor in an hour and a half of mugging for the camera.
Nominally a comedy this is a strange little film that is humorous but never laugh out loud funny.
Watching her shine so magnificently over the ordure that is the rest of it is rather amazing to see, and the fashion show in the last 15 minutes has some fun costumes.
The tearjerking that tugged though was uniquely caused by suppressed hilarity - when I wasn't yawning, that is.
I regret to inform, none of that is evident in "Romanzo Criminale" The great bunch of young Italian actors assembled in one film!
Michele Placido and his script writers concoct a confused and confusing document that is as annoying, tedious and opportunistic as it is long, endless really.
Riccardo Scamarcio has a face to launch a thousand ships but unfortunately no character and Stefano Accorsi is totally unbelievable in a character that is nothing short of absurd.
How about a movie that is directed and written by the original director who directed all but 3 of the episodes?
Everyone who took part in this movie should be ashamed.Even actors who I actually like have totally collapsed before my eyes.Seeking any deep meaning and symbolism in this movie is just absurd.It completely lacks any originality.Istead there is some kind of redneckish humour in which there can't be any allegory - it is what it is - incredibly flat and superficial.I love sex jokes but they should at least be funny,not just a line of dirty words and gross images of horny old people.I voted with one star just because there is no option to vote with half or less,but this movie doesn't deserve even that much (well,maybe for the music,but that is quite merciful).Seriously,one of the worst movies ever made.
This movie has only one theme and that is sex, sex and some more sex.
The same for other characters like Fat F*ck Frank, Papa and Mama Bear (fat and hairy gay men), a policeman who likes to behave like a baby, someone who has a dirt fetish,... you really can't think of anything that isn't in the movie...  Of course I already had an idea of what to expect.
In fact, director Tobe Hooper only shows us what is necessary, maybe because of the low budget he was working with (Hooper's later output would suggest this), but it forced creativity from the filmmaker that is sadly lacking in his other work (Poltergeist may be an exception, but Hooper's direction was steered by Spielberg on that one).
If you can watch it more than once that isÂ
The Hansons who were likable goons transformed to boring businessmen and that is criminal.
In the interior shots of the abandoned house the blacks are crushed and we only see silhouettes moving against the textures in the walls and those are juxtaposed with exterior shots where the whites wash out, like some kind of rural hell, a land of some other order that is coming apart under the weight of its own abandonment.
Like an avalanche of macabre images that is impossible to stop once it starts, TCM whizzes by in a manic pace.
They are simply different vessels of the Capitalist thought that is within everyone, and as long you love and support them they will continue to make millions off of the ignorant.
I don't know if that is the truth, but i was the feeling I was left with at the end of the film.
In this movie that isn't a case.
There is also the appearance of fellow Chicagoan Anne Marie (Eufala Roop from ULTRAVIXENS) that is all too brief.
There is no more warm and loving family or friend interaction for the sake of it, and that is the glue that holds the show together.
It is hard to get into a movie that is implausible out of the starting gate.
A REALLY, REALLY horny self, that is!
Well, that is if you squint REALLY hard and maybe get REALLY drunk first and hit yourself on the head with a frying pan, and,...
But trust me when I tell you, that is the only reason (and one other I'll mention in a moment)  The scenes are shabbily put together (everything looks rushed).
Italian people, that is.
Adding to this major flaw, a terrible script that is even outdone by most TV series nowadays helps to oppress any magic that might wanted to be conjured to the screen.
These women have not changed since high school and still have low self esteem and I can't believe he supports them and then tells these other women on other shows that acting like that is wrong.
Well, this is the same thing that is going on with this show.
But understand that is also viewer manipulation and part of television's contribution to the decline of western civilization.
I watch and enjoy art movies, great films that explore people, concepts, relations, but that is not what this was for me.
Plus, it focuses on the Korean War, a period in our history that is generally ignored in movies.
In truth, this film doesn't even have to be appreciated as a war film, though that is the setting.
I'm not thinking too hard about it so don't rail on me if you disagree with anything political or possibly even factual that is coming out of my keyboard.
There is nothing in this movie that is even remotely close to the genre as this is standard television movie of the week fare.
wheeler-dealer men who are all connected to each other trying to pull off the big "heist", a dialogue that is fleshed out with the serving of drinks and the lighting of cigarettes, cinematography that looks like it was captured from an assortment from the airport post-card stand and music that is meant for the tourists.
F.Y.I Never select an old movie title with two recognizable actors in it on the basis of the title since it RARELY has a connection with the film but is usually a loose translation of the original title name that is stylized to entice the American audience!
I give this a 2/10 and that is the worst i give.
This movie was just as bad as the Carnosaurs trilogy, and that is saying a lot.
I don't care, that is the first thing that has ruined it for me.
Perhaps some of the special effects were okay but that is very easy to get done properly these days I think.
This movie simply insults the intelligence of the viewer and that is made worse by the fact that it is more aimed to children.
Don't you know what that is?!?
Take the time to find a place that is still showing Stardust, if it is 2 counties away, still worth more than subjecting your self to this terrible "coming of age" fiasco.
The family is changed, leaving out the close knit structure that is the basis of the story.
The one thing that is obvious after watching this movie is that the egos of Tsutomu Shimomura and John Markoff are off the scale.
not only am i mad the "true story" was wrong on details, i'm equally pi**ed about the amount of "hacker fluff" that is presented.
This is an awful,wretched,painful,terrible film, ranking second only to the excremental smear that is "September Dawn" on the list of inept cinematic portrayals of LDS history.
It starts on well,have some very spectacular visuals of Africa,but it disintegrates,disorients thereafter.Its very good example how you neglect most vital part(rather say it soul)of movie that is SCRIPT and ends up most boring movie ever made.Storyline simple,leave it nothing to say more about it.I usually watch horror flick for special effect ,but it is not the case here.It seems director avoids such situation where special effect needed,if its there though very few which looks really primitive as compared to other Hollywood movies.I think it could have been better,overall its bad in all aspects except photography.
Here that is what the film tries to do with Gustave - the HUGE killer croc.
There's just not much about this that is worthwhile.
We take it, the Chinese take it, we decide to take it back.... You really get a sense of the tactics employed by the troops on both sides and the tough job that is the infantryman's assaulting a hill, amid confusion, snafus, and the ever-present risk of death.
While dragon ball and dragon ball z are two of the best animes ever created the pitiful ending that it was given doesn't do it any justice.Dragon Ball GT was clearly poorly written while it was some what entertaining it is a utter disgrace to previous dragon ball sagas.The fact that is was canceled was shame enough.The creators should have just ended it with Dragon Ball Z as the original plan was.Another thing,Goku in his super saiyan 4 form is as cocky as Vegeta since when Goku has the cockiness of Vegeta.All he is babbling about is what he is capable of when really there doesn't seem to be much strength in that form.Its Super Saiyan 4 for God sakes at Super Saiyan level 1 he seemed to had more power.How the hell you could get trashed so much at level 4?Very disappointed in this stupid end to a brilliant anime saga.
And yes, I am aware VHS tapes aren't made anymore that is why.
For some reason that is never properly explained, she has infected herself with the curse via Ginger's blood and has gotten herself addicted to the cure, the plant; monkshood, in order to stop herself changing into a werewolf like her sister did.
I watch many bad movies each year, but every once in a while, I come across a film that is without a single redeeming quality.
This movie was sacrilegious and greatly disrespectful to the Angels of God, by implying that any messengers of God would perform any act that is strictly against God's law.
If it was acting then that is impressive!
There's a romance that is never carried out.
Directed by Roberta Findlay Prime Evil is a straight to VHS abomination that is plagued by such a weak plot and bi-polar performances by the two leads, the walking dead Alexandra (Christine Moore) and the smarmy Thomas Seaton (William Beckwith), that you quickly realize why this was never released in theaters.
Prime Evil tells of a satanic cult whose members can achieve immortality and invulnerability through the regular sacrifice of blood relatives to a hideous demon (that is about two foot tall and seems to be made of red rubber).
At this point the only thing worth seeing in the movie was the blond's boobs, and that is the theme of the movie.
Watchable in a bad movie sort of way, its the sort of thing that is best seen only when going through a multiple film set since its not worth the time or the effort to see a film like this as a stand alone.
Ah, another example of everything that is wrong with Hollywood.
Pick up the puppet that is drilling into your balls!
The "Curse of the Puppet Master" has a good premise that is undermined by unconvincing puppet violence and the usual weaknesses of low-budget films.
Curse of the Puppet Master is set in a small American town where the ever so slightly dim Robert 'Tank' Winsley (Josh Green) works as a lowly gas station attendant for $30 a week, that is until curio collector & owner of a museum of oddities Dr. Magrew (George Peck) & his lovely young daughter Jane (Emily Harrison) stop for gas.
Okay, it is realistic material that is filmed, but still... First of all the introduction of the main character takes very long - and it's not worth it!
But, all in all, Dimples is a children's movie that is no longer, if it ever was, suitable for children.
The film however has only one saving grace and that is the appearance of Chris Walken as the second in charge of a mob family.
But it's the treatment of these issues that is so poor.
Dark Ride is a film that is full of clichÃ©s, presumably in some kind of homage to the '80's slasher films, but it just doesn't work for me in this one.
I say that, but that is not to say it is a perfect film.
Guys, that is getting so old.
The police arrest the serial killer that is sentenced to life in a mental institution; finds fourteen other bodies hidden in the spot and the justice shuts-down the attraction.
Fourteen years later, a group of five friends and a hitchhiker decides to visit the amusement park that is offering free lodging in its reopening.
When you make movies about something, you have to be true and humble towards the subject; that is if your intention is the celebrate with a slice of criticism.
From the quality of work shown (which is Clowes' work, by the way) that is all there is to him.
There seems to be some need to spoof a complete film, so in Skateboarders from hell we get a climatic funeral scene that isn't very funny and destroys the laughs that the film had generated with the "biker" fight.
Seeing Kate Winslet naked seems to be everyone's favorite part of this film but, as wonderful as that is, it comes out of nowhere and is made ludicrous and disgusting by the fact that she is peeing on herself.
And that is the movie as far as I'm concerned.
Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) never play opposite a kid 2) never play opposite an animal 3) never play opposite someone that is almost 3 feet taller than you, is as innocent as a kid and "acts" like an animal.
There is only one word to say about this movie and that is boring.
The script contained so many old cliches that I lost count of them, and that is not too good.
This is a pretty awful movie that allows one to wander the house, do laundry, read a book (even the book upon which the movie is based) and still be bored with it (the movie that is).
This perhaps is the most frustrating aspect as quite often one is left with an uncertain feeling... Was there something to be learned - ow was that a simple joke.. Then when the story goes to describing real historic facts these are often fast paced listings of years, names of important people/fights, etc.. Perhaps that is the part for adults as the kids have no chance of learning from that level of details coming at that pace..  Transitions from the life of individuals to the world events is often surprising and would benefit from better justification / preparation.
It appears to be a comedy at first glance but that is rather deceiving.
This is a pretty good movie that is obviously made fore TV and should stay there.
Overall, a sorry mess of a film that is so inexplicably dumb that I can't believe it was made in the first place.
I watched it, and although the animation is not on par with anything that is out today, it is still probably one of the funniest things I have ever seen in my life.
And then they reused Miss Argento's footage 15 or 20 times at the end(not that that is necessarily an altogether bad thing)I began to think that they really only shot like 8 scenes for this movie then edited them together repeatedly.
I will give Mr. Ferrara credit where it is due with his film - he creates a very evocative and sensual Tokyo underworld, and gets a strong performance from Christopher Walken as Fox, the head of a syndicate that is going to seduce and snatch the world's top genetic biologist from one mega-corporation to work for another.
But you'll be warned: the effort of going through this clearly stupid and ugly movie will not be rewarded at the end, it will be punished because watching it is VAIN and painful (for any serious film aficionado, that is).
The escape is so unlikely but that is conveniently ignored because the plot requires the vigilante to get away.
)I can believe i have wasted a hour and half of life on this pieces of rubbish that is called a horror movie.
There is no originality in the story that is violent and never funny.
The only positive thing I can say about 'Threat' is that the animation that is interlaced into the movie is not bad, and the editing is sometimes interesting.
there is a certain amount of senselessness here, and that is what drive this movie to a moot point.
It does present an image of Hollywood that is not portrayed in many films today, the seedy dirty side where the normal people exist.
I did not connect with any of the characters except for the creature and in a movie like this, that is imperative otherwise you're quickly losing interest.
Although the makeup done by Daniel Parker, Paul Engelen and Carol Hemming was pretty frightening, the film never really gave me that spine-shiver that is expected from a horror.
Yes, it's a novel about creating life and playing God, but underneath that is a novel about both adolescent sexuality Â Young Victor, alone in his attic, fooling around with nature Â and also the consequences of creating a life and then not taking responsibility for it.
I read the book in 12th grade, and I can't say I liked the story, but that is not my beef with this movie.
I do understand that this was a low budget film but that is no excuse for such a poor effort by all involved.
If that isn't bad enough, and this is a spoiler, (as if this movie was unpredictable to have that matter) the hero all but give up when he is lead to believe the great love of his life is dead only to be given renewed hope from a weed sticking up from a crack in the floor!
In the end what really kills the movie is that is too buried in cheap, live-action reality.
Where the anime and manga transport you to a post-apocalyptic world that is both disturbing and fantastic, this movie always feels tied into shoddy sets and lame costumes.
There is nothing with this film that is good..
The agent takes her on her first job as a model at a resort home that is run by a group of witches.
This was hyped up to be about some lady that is the head of a cult and was supposed to be a sadist or something.
It also insists that the company "does everything in its power to prevent accidents", which in my corporate experience is exactly as likely as *individuals* doing everything possible; that is to say, not at all likely.
The film features dialogue that is so straight forward and non descriptive, and the subtext is so blandly dumb, it is literally unbelievable.
What about poor Joan Cusack, who hasn't got a single line to utter that isn't a cliche pulled off a radio call-in show?
This is the future you buy into, folks - a battle between (vaguely African descent) aliens and (mostly white) humans, for an earth that is little more than a wasteland, following a global disaster caused by poor eugenics.
The answer to that is yes.
After doing a bit of research I came to the scary conclusion that apparently this piece of cr*p that is this film is actually taken seriously by Scientologists, not unlike Christians with regard to the Bible.
I don't think it will matter too much to point out everything that is bad about this film, but the acting, the dialog, the special effects, the plausibility of the cave people's quick learning development, and of course, the hair extensions will just have to suffice.
If that is the case, the hapless direction of the utterly inept Joseph Losey was entirely confounded by a notion like "mystery".
Truly worthy of the Hitchcockian label, "The Vanishing" weaves a tale that is both frightening and dramatic.
This was filmed on the beautiful Cayman Islands,It should have been done on the Santa Monica beach, that is how much it looked like the Caymans.
I am a descendant of the island and I am appalled to see that is how the island is being represented.
I think, however, films like this need to be viewed and studied for those of us who are chasing the unicorn that is filmmaking.
From there it builds a compelling plot of growing tension that escalates to a finale that is absolutely chilling and powerful.
It's an outstanding modern genre classic that isn't only tasteful and gripping, but strikingly smart too.
For a movie with a somewhat similar premise but sublime execution and a main character that is ten times more menacing, check out "Man On Fire" starring a very convincing Denzel Washington.
Apparently that is the plot????
It bears mentioning that the film's director also made "Blacula", a film that is eons better than this one.
Many film endings can be shocking and may stick with you forever, and for a lot of people that is certainly the case with this film.
Billy the Kid was an insignificant, unremarkable, pimply-faced, orthodontia-challenged 21-year-old thug that is remembered today because the New Mexico Department of Tourism spends hundreds of thousands of dollars every year to make sure that we do.
And that is the right word, because a movie like The Vanishing is not just watched-it is experienced.
I repeat: a seaplane that is OLD and DIRTY.
The only reason I gave it a three instead of the -10 it richly deserves is that there is a remote possibility that there may be a film out there somewhere that is actually worse than this.
First I was actually offended that they're showing the town it took place in as wide spot in the road where all the woman have to do is whore themselves out, the men beat the women and work of cars, that is when they're not at the bar.
If you have not yet experienced the crappiness that is the Manitou - save yourself - and rent anything else.
However, it was apparently a film that got a film release and that is kind of sad considering how weak the film is as a horror movie.
Ms. Sprecher and her sister Karen wrote a delicious movie that is on the one level a satire about the way "temps" are used in an office, and it's at the same time, a character study about these four souls at the center of the movie.
Zhang Yimou directs this film about a forbidden love that is kept secret for fear of public retaliation.
Second to that is the treatment of the autistic son, Tian-bai.
I hope most people watch it for its unintentional or even intentional comedic value, but even that is disgusting, as I wish it wouldn't even get those ratings.
Because that is all I see.
in full Jack (THE SHINING) Nicholson mode, while his victims/successors are your typical teens: one white and one black, obsessed with carnage-happy video games but who cringe in the face of real death Â so they dare one another to enter a morgue at night and take a good look at the latest 'intern'Âand that is where their troubles begin.
Flashbacks overused in modern cinema and that is a perfect example.
As someone that was born and raised in New Jersey, a huge Howard Stern fan (back when it was free, that is), and a fan of both baseball movies and R-rated comedies, I had high hopes for this movie.
Stick to the radio show Artie, that is what you do best.
By being overly anti political correct, that is ultimately what killed this film.
It's also one of those comedies that isn't really a comedy at all, meaning that it has no laughs in it or great comical situations.
It's not too often that a movie comes along that is so bad it makes me angry... but this is one.
This is the epitome of a horror movie that is so incredibly ridiculous, that in moments where you should be scared, you find yourself laughing instead of gasping.
It's is a terrible, achingly boring movie that is so slow movie.
Badly acted, a script that makes little sense, bad editing, and audio that isn't even matched up right.
What I saw was a movie that is food for termites.
And that is the feeling you get when you watch this; that it's some high-school student film project which got misplaced and by some horrible freak accident wound up on the shelves of the video store.
i wish axlerod would've been the bad guy because that is an awesome name for a villain.
Many of the characters lacked the depth that is seen in the manga.
Okay so I laughed on and off throughout the entire picture, so that is why I gave it one step above a 1.
*spoilers*  The first death scene is quite surprising, I mean the guys are killed by corn, well that is dodgy.
Now that is quite original, and when I was first told of this by my Cousin I pictured it vividly.
But even that isn't enough for the cheesily poor script writers, who wrote in that her last words should be "oh what a world!"?
All realism is thrown out the window at this point, that is if you hadn't done so already what with the Journalist mentioning in a almost tribute manner "Jones Town" just to be controversial (or maybe its just that all American news reporters are inconsiderate slimeballs) and the "killer predator in the corn" bull.
SHADOW: DEAD RIOT is a disappointing pseudo-exploit mess that is really no better than any other STV crap that's out there nowdays...  Tony (CANDYMAN) Todd plays some fake dread-locked voodoo guy that is a death-row killer.
First of all, no one has a life that is this boring and pointless.
if you want to see a film that is really bad then see this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nothing is funny, nothing is good.I donÂ´t think that you could make a film that is worse than this one.
There are moments that you can see are Pythonesque , and that is more down to the fact that Michael Palin stars rather than the script but over all this film is just...well..Dull.
The movie is a period piece that is more like a Gosford Park with humor than a Pretty Woman as a Victorian costume drama.
My reason for saying that is; how on earth can you kill a zombie by breaking its neck?
The sound was THE worst I've ever heard in a film that is listed on IMDb, in some scenes you can barely hear the actors and in others their voices nearly broke my speakers.
It's not even one of those movies that is so bad it's funny - it's just plain bad in every way - the plot - the script - the cast - the effects - all terrible.
Starring, written, produced & directed by the aforementioned Len Kabasinski there are films which are so bad it's untrue, then there's the celluloid abomination that is Swamp Zombies.
The film has an overall tone that is way way way too serious for a comedy--a clear indication of an amateur comedy-director.
Suffice is nothing compared to the masterpiece that is, "Sorority House Massacre II".
If you're looking for a scare, pass this one up, but check it out if you and your friends are looking for a funny slasher flick that is nothing but pure cheese.
While that is indeed quite an accomplishment and all technical aspects are admirably handled the fact remains that this film is a complete and utter dud.
Well, I know for a fact, that is not true.
The reasoning behind that is that several decades ago she killed her husband because....he...wanted to take her to the doctor to get mental help.
And since one character dies in garbage, maybe that is the best description of it.
The music sounded rather chipper for scenes that seemed dark and a plot that is haunting.
Rodney Dangerfield brings character to a character that is essentially a milder, toned down canine version of himself.
Poor teenagers who have to be better this movie whose name they can give you is that is bullshit about the size of a piano.
So he is a ghost that is miracurosly alive and in good shape coming back for his so called "Revenge" just like Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th.
OK, I am getting sick of the recent trend in horror movies - that of every film being a Rembrandt picture (that is, no source of light and the background being all black).
As far as a summary, take "Nightmare On Elm Street 3", add some even worse acting and production, add a killer that is one part Freddy Kruger, and one part Marcus Welby MD, and you've got this heaping pile of dung.
Also, there is this one cheesy song that is played a total of THREE times, including during the closing credits.
The youth that is going to be killed are the typical kind of kids appearing in a horror movie.
Sooner they find that their dorm is haunted by Dr. Burke that is seeking for tortured souls.
I am not one of the people who hates soaps, I love some American soaps like Sunset Beach and Days of our lives(the way it was in the 90s that is) But this one is terrible !!
The only good thing about this show is Svein, he is the only character that is fun to watch and the actor is brilliant !!
However, that is no excuse for the 90 minutes of my life that were savagely taken from me.
If men were bred out of life, there might be a chance for a future but that isn't yet possible.
The story doesn't showcase the wonderful character Persia wrote and that is a shame, they had great source material.
With the exception of Billy Zane and Michael Madsen there are no big names here and in many ways that is a good thing because the two stars are the weakest characters.
The Helm films are just sleazy and crude--and the single joke that is the film wears thin very fast.
I give this 4/10 and that is only because of Lucy Lawless.I will always be a Lucy Lawless fan and anything she is in deserves some sort of score.
Pick up the puppet that is drilling into your balls!
The "Curse of the Puppet Master" has a good premise that is undermined by unconvincing puppet violence and the usual weaknesses of low-budget films.
Curse of the Puppet Master is set in a small American town where the ever so slightly dim Robert 'Tank' Winsley (Josh Green) works as a lowly gas station attendant for $30 a week, that is until curio collector & owner of a museum of oddities Dr. Magrew (George Peck) & his lovely young daughter Jane (Emily Harrison) stop for gas.
of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
More important, this film that is supposed to be a tribute to the world of Marcel Pagnol was an unexpected success at the French box-office.
But by mixing the two, director Robert Gediguian creates an unappetising sludge that is messy, meandering and boring - a crime with such potentially interesting characters to explore.
The problem with this kind of film is that people who adhere to democratic values need not be taught this stuff at such a childish - and sometimes downright stupid - level, while the capitalist viewer sees a conformation of his prejudice that a "communist" director has neither the intelligence nor the good taste to make a film about the working class that is worth spending his costly time on.
When Grandpa and Grandma Addams get the rare Wontheimer's (?spelling) disease that is slowly turning them normal, Gomez decides to take his family to a family reunion, but end up going to the Adams family reunion instead, while an ordinary couple ends up at the Addams family home.
And that is my problem with Addams Family Reunion.
In fact, all in all, the only genuinely dark thing about this film is the mere shadow that is it to it's two classic predecessors.
As an episode it's rather predictable with the 'hero' saving the day in stupid fashion during the lacklustre ending & a story that is very linear & a bit clichÃ©d.
Less of an adaptation and more of a total reinvention of the successful stage play, the film version of Cabaret is one of the few movie musicals that is almost universally considered to be superior to the Broadway play that inspired it.
The Four Last Songs do not enter into the presented theme if there is an attempt to bring out a theme, and perhaps that is its greatest flaw: what was this about - wife vs muse, father/daughter, ex patriots adrift, brothers in jeopardy?
He thinks that by marrying her and making her his wife that is going to help her.
He's ideal to play a character that is simultaneously pathetic and creepy.
The actors (that is being very generous) seem to act like it all makes a lot of sense.
However, if you hated Punky Brewster as a child or even if you were an adult there is a scene in this movie that is sure to delight you!
It's up to the new sheriff to find out what that is.
Sure, wars need to be fought, that is indisputable, but not in every case, and war movies should never be so blindingly simpleminded and stupid, pandering on behalf of the Pentagon to the lowest brow audience for support.
Well alot of things, however, all that is bad centers around Dr. Pavan Grover...
Take it from a warm blooded American girl anyone who thinks Grover is hot has got real bad taste, he was creepy and that is just how he is that is not acting.
This is not a horror because it is not scary, not a pyschological thriller because it has no real psychology or thrills, it is bad just bad that is it.
The story concerns some sort of brain machine that shows thoughts on a computer, that is used to study this superman, sort of the devil incarnate, who can exert mind control and is also psychic.
Not to mention the whole enviromental scare thing about the ozone layer that is the basis for the movie.
Although it is true that most sequels are not as good as the original movies on which they are based, it is truly rare to find a sequel that is so bad it actually tries to undermine its original.
At any rate, neither am I too sure I want to know what that is, either.
And that is where the show fails because at the end of the day its even more vapid and than the conventions it is trying to satirize.
But that is all you get.
I am writing this review to spare many people of the pain that is this horrible show.
However, once they decided to try to parody what feels like just about everything that (they think) needs parodying and start to dabble in the crap-fest that is "anti-humor", they tank horribly.
And that is exactly what Tim and Eric try to do.
That was something I wrote off of the top of my head that is in a similar vein to the skits shown on this horrible series.
I applaud the filmmakers for wanting to make a movie that is more than a Gothic drama, but they went the wrong way and forgot the drama.
2 marks for acting quite well Ms Jolie Pitt but minus 10 for taking on a story that is only there to glorify YOU.
The film is nominally about a circus that is chronically on the verge of bankruptcy.
The only saving grace in the film was that the stunts were performed by Kane Hodder, who played 'Jason' in several of the "Friday the 13th" films, but even that is just a point of interest rather than an extra star to the film.
When they come back to the House, they notice a little winged creature came with them and so did something resembling a green dog...And that is supposed to be FUNNY ?!?
Now, creating an audience response like that is not an easy thing to do, and Haneke did go on to become a brilliant filmmaker, but The Seventh Continent seemed to me a stylish, empty exercise in morbidity.
if you want to see a film that is really bad then see this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Nothing is funny, nothing is good.I donÂ´t think that you could make a film that is worse than this one.
The truth doesn't sell, that is why we are seeing a disturbing trend of "based on a true story" movies that really have very little to do with what actually happened.
And the Turkish public has a right to the fantasy that is being sold by this movie.
They have the right to fight against the Kurdish Separatist Movement that is so prevalent in Northern Iraq.
Personally I liked the last story the best, but that is not saying much.
The topper is that is also contains the best ending as you continue to guess who the culprit is.
"Campfire Stories" was pretty lame,in my opinion.the opening sequence,with the so called flaming skull,looked like it was made on the cheap,to be polite.normally,i try to be diplomatic about bad acting in movies,but that would be hard in this case,so i won't say any more about that.aside from that,i didn't find it scary.i guess it's supposed to be something like "Tales From the Crypt" or "Creepshow",but it certainly doesn't measure up to either of those anthology series.i don't know what else to say.i guess i could talk about the lack of suspense,or even tension in the movie.or the fact that is not much gore for you gore hounds.to be fair, i didn't watch the whole thing.i didn't even watch all of the first episode.i fell asleep,but I'm fairly certain the rest of the anthology is no better.most people would likely be bored by this one.my advice is to avoid "Campfire Stories" and look elsewhere to satisfy your entertainment needs.I'll give this movie 3/10,at most.
The topper is that is also contains the best ending as you continue to guess who the culpret is.
It centers around a main character that is holding his balance between having bad luck and just being stupid.
I for one cant recommend it to anyone,I will how ever try to get my hands on the longer version that is supposed to exist and see if they manage to salvage the promise this movie almost showed.
But there is a rumor is that the European version is 160 minutes long and this American version was cut to only 90 minutes so that is why it is so confusing.
And the decision to make both points mysterious has led to a conclusion that is confusing and unsatisfying, both intellectually and emotionally.
There is, for example, a major, major plot development revealed in the third act of the movie that is so bizarre that it's almost like someone slipped in a page from a completely different movie.
The only movie that I have seen that is worse stars Susan Lucci, and she can't act her way out of a paperbag, so that isn't saying much (French Silk).
The film relied on a shoestring budget and the only type of special effect is a repeated shot of this huge machine spurting out a gooey pile of hodgepodge that is supposed to look like human leftovers.
First season or two were great, but that is only what is worth in Andromeda...
that is the worst turnaround ever in the worst direction.
And a main character that is some kind of superhero without any depth at all.
But that is not an excuse for the complete and utter garbage Phileine Zegt Sorry is.
Famous for it's censorship wrangles and delayed release, SON OF SINBAD is like a kids film made for dirty old men..in fact that is exactly what it is......Vincent Price plays the whole thing like he is really Eve Arden.
His behavior is increasingly aggressive and near the end of the movie he ends up butchering someone with an axe.This storyline meets one that is very reminiscent of movies such as " Evil Dead" because his girlfriend hooks up with the bunch of brainless , shallow bores and goes with them to party in an abandoned tower ( but where are the stairs inside of that tower? )
But I guess thats what you get with a movie that is just a little over and hour and thirty minutes long.
This definition of course is something that is funny.
I would like the 87 minutes of my life back, but seeing as that is impossible, I would like to keep anyone else from viewing this shoddy workmanship.
That `vision,' however, turns out to be somewhat clouded, and though the basic story remains intact, it comes across as something of a `Cliff's notes' rendition that is less than satisfying.
Then there are the performances that fall into the `acceptable' category, but are far beneath the capabilities of the actors involved, respectively: As Hamlet, Ethan Hawke adopts a brooding attitude that is effective, but he fails to achieve the commanding presence necessary to make his Hamlet viable.
Murray is arguably one of the best comic actors the screen has ever known, and that is not something to be taken lightly; comedy is one of the hardest genres to master, and Murray is one of the best.
But that is knowledge from the last century or even older.
The Great Outdoors might entertain you if you're new to this kind of film, but if you've seen any of the others you'll find very little that is fresh here.
This Swedish police movie contains everything that is bad in the genre and runs it once again, but in an almost amateurish way.
Though, "Growing Up Gotti" has got to be the WORST show that A&E has ever aired which in all honesty is saying quite a lot when you compare it to the asinine and mind-numbing fodder that is "Dog: The Bounty Hunter" and "Airline"!
On a road called "Shane," I believe, that is sandwiched between two huge burial parks(Fitting).
Hollywood already has an overabundance of derivative action movies if that is what you're looking for (nothing wrong with that, i love many of them too).
To imply that blacks can't be racist but whites can is a form of racism that is as bad as any Jim Crow law.
The werewolf is barely shown at all, that is effective only if there is any REAL suspense.
None of that is present in this movie.
Let's see....we have the girl that is goth looking (because we all know girls that wear black lipstick are wildly depressed).
If that is true, the mummy cannot think.
A non-connected, early-'80s "Porky"-style adolescent string of puns and bathroom humor that is an insult to anyone who has rented this expecting some railroad action.
I sat through this tripe hoping(nay, praying)that it would somehow lift itself out of the mediocrity that is established in the first few scenes....
Maybe I'm just missing something, I don't know, or perhaps I don't know enough about the inner circles of independent film-making to be able to see how this film succeeds; but if that is the case, then what are we supposed to think of a film so "smart" that its audience doesn't even get it?
Theres always that question who's next.I do not really think of it that way but that is how my Review is written.
Please people, stop watching this and all other reality shows, they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create.
I don't know, for some reason a movie that is entirely dark just doesn't ever work out as a scary or mysterious one.
He was not near as good as Fredric March in the 1931 version, but that is way too high of a measuring stick.
A realism that is vulgar "   " But it's the lack of realism that is vulgar "   Or   " Passion embraces your lips with its hideous fire "   I'm not exactly reminded of Oscar Wilde with these lines or indeed William Goldman or Robert Towne .
Eye of God is a well-crafted independent film that is fatally flawed by its reliance on a current mainstream-film cliche as a central plot element: that any character with religious convictions will be revealed in the course of the film as a psychopath.
Sometimes an independent film succeeds because it is different and the producers have an original vision that is unique and refreshingly new.
See Alligator (1980) as an example of a movie like this that is done well.
So that is kind of a disappointment.
And a world that is desperately searching and aching for love and tenderness.
It also has to do with the song that is played over the end credits.
All of the stuff that is covered in this movie Plus alien abduction!!!!!!!!!!!!
Definitely a movie that is so bad it's fun.
Incredibly stupid that is!
Who ever thought that a chattering teeth toy could kill some one, I mean come on who thinks that is scary?
You're better off getting a cheap B-flick that is campy and fun.
It's a very corny, silly movie that is easy to watch.
The same radiation that is supposed to wipe out humans like the peach...   Sixthly, 5 200-megaton nukes?
I know those space suits they had on looked cool, but they couldn't withstand the ~1000 degrees of temperature, and a few thousand kPa of pressure that is needed to keep the geode from collapsing under the weight of the world.
Why can't someone, just once, produce a version of the Island of Dr. Moreau that is even slightly faithful to the original (and may I say excellent) book.
THE HONEYMOON KILLERS is by contrast an incredibly bland and boring movie that is merely relying on the fact it has a basing on real events in order to attract viewers.
Huston finds a strange, distant tone that is somewhere between ironic and completely bizarre, with intentionality that is questionable at best.
That's a Gordian knot I haven't been able to untie yet...  A true and newly born German entertainment cinema is certainly about to appear on the spotlight - but DER CLOWN dosen't belong to it (... at least, that is what I hope!)
Bad video, that is, with the predominant colours being red (explosions, the actors' faces) and grey (everything else).
But I tend to expect at least a small storyline that is been followed in the film.
Very low budget, wooden acting, and a story that is as incomprehensible,as it is dull.
It has a firm first act: the problem is that a grown man, named Elwood P. Dowd, has an imaginary friend that is a six foot tall rabbit-similar to the Easter bunny-named Harvey.
There is a romantic sub-plot that is way out of place.
The movie looks like it was thrown together at the last minute with a mish-mashed story line that is so transparent you can see clear through it.
I guess everybody was naughty this year...that is the only explanation for releasing this piece of punishment!
And it isn't one of those movies that is so bad its funny ethier.
And Martin Short an actor I really like has been reduced to an overacting buffoon that is only a carbon copy of baddies that have come before him.
Few movies offer the senseless violence and absence of artistic skill that is evident in this movie.
I, myself, will seek a film with plot, substance and creativity that is worth my time and expense of life energy.
Each character has a vice that eventually leads to either a downfall or an awakening and this film beautifully shows us the desperation of suicide, the depths of inner turmoil and the satisfaction of a love that is finally realized.
In this alleged comedy, there are few smiles, no laughs, and very little that is entertaining or edifying.
Gregg Araki created a trippy tale of teen angst that is so over-dramatized that it actually makes you feel drunk while you're watching it.
This is one of those movies that is so obviously thrown together to make a quick buck that anyone stuck watching it is bound to feel embarrassed after sitting through, say, the first ten minutes, wondering why they have chosen to waste their time in such a way.
You get "Stealth Fighter" a movie that is almost insulting to the intelligence.
This is just a show about a guy who's trying to satisfy his ID 24/7 and three women who sadly feel he is the best that they can do--well, that is until Pam divorces him and remarries, Kathy is separated from him and who knows what happened to Denise.
it is about nothing and it is nowhere... as is just about everything that is popular now-a-days.
And that is what this film prides itself on unpredictability.
The movie, on the other hand, while well-acted and visually attractive, does not seem to understand that it is Janie's character development, not her finding love, that is the most important part of the story--and without this development, even with the chemistry between the actors, the story feels shallow.
It seems that if there is a sex scene, that is when we see her act her best.
Does that mean it is a thought provoking film that is going to open up the floor for dialogue amongst great minds?
For the love of god and all that is good, never watch this trash.
As for the second joke, that is surely rooted in some very strange and distorted attitudes towards women.
Shahid and Kareena Kapoor that is.
Priyanka Chopra that is?
Such a high success rate that is increasingly getting rare in the Hindi film industry is a miracle in itself.
In this flick for example, they crafted a thriller that is the core but as usual is not great and neither is their suspense but surely this is not a genre film and therefore they bring the elements of comedy (the highlight of the film), Romance, Foot-tapping Music as well as sufficient skin show make all the difference.
There is not enough space here to write everything that is wrong with this film.
I'll instead close by writing everything that is good about this film........  Thankfully it didn't waste any more of our lives then 90 minutes.
But that is probably STILL not worth a reason to rent this movie.
However, what really gets under my skin are the silly characters (talking animals as usual, one with a "cute", that is to say pointless, speech impediment), the dull, insipid plot, the heavy-handed narration, and so on.
This is one book that is crying for a remake!
My god I hope that is not the level of intelligence being produced by todays education system.
IMDb says I must post at least 10 lines of text in this comment, but its difficult to type anything that is just not negative about this movie.
It's a long, dull movie with nothing to recommend it... except for one thing that is worth noting:  Almost every other review points out that this movie seems to be the inspiration for "Monty Python and the Holy Grail."
This is a movie that is rated R, it even says so in the credits, because of nudity and sex.
There is no dialog only voice over as Cindy and two other people relate the story to you over footage that is a combination someones vacation film and the sort of stuff that is worse than what I used to shoot in 8 mm, with the exception that my stuff never had a naked blonde in it.
At least that is what we're told and what is instigated through Pryor's reaction to him.
Regardless of our feelings toward Bush, we need to fight Al-Queda there, because that is where they chose, or else we will be fighting them here, in LA, NYC, Atlanta, and Omaha.
It is, simply, an awful movie that is anti-American, and against our courageous volunteer army.
At least Un Posto Ideale Per Uccidere isn't particularly offensive or nasty Â it's just a routine thriller with a splash of sex and nudity, obvious plot developments, a fashionably downbeat ending, and a toe-tapping soundtrack that is blissfully unrelated to the events on screen!
To Western sensibilities, the characters are maddeningly uncommunicative, that is until pushed to the extreme of emotion or crisis.
But that is all really of interest.
An ambitious but ultimately unsatisfying western that is bound to irritate fans beyond measure, "Track of the Cat" (1954) is an uneasy mix of hunting-the-cat action and sub-Eugene O'Neill playwriting, complete with jarring comic relief and loquacious but indecisive moralizing.
But that is right before the best part--and most action--of the whole movie.
BTW, I was sort of shocked, if that is the right word, where at the beginning of the credits, it said Starring Ronald Coleman in Kismet, with Marlene Dietrich.
An hour and a half of film and that is absolutely the only positive thing I can think to say.
if u like crap that is more crap than crap watch this one and you will have a blast.
The whole movie seems more like a documentary look into people's lives and that is a credit to the acting.
The first problem is that is runs for a minuscule 6 minutes.... take away the credits and you're left with a 4 minute film.
Rouke took a stab at modern boxing noir, and stabs the audience with clichÃ© characters, and dialog that is trying for Cassevettes but is more fitting to an episode of 'Melrose Place'.
while part of the acting is fine, and the snakes are semi believable (not outragiously huge) the speed with which the victims die is too exagerated, and it is almost identical to the old movie "Rattler" that is now makign the rounds of network tv movie filler during reruns seasons.
If there are other variations, go for the one that is blank.
I remember liking this film as a child, so at least on that level Thumbelina is a success for it is a film aimed for the children, but whilst many Disney films can still hold some of their magic for the older audiences, that is where Thumbelina falls down for once the viewer reaches the age where they become critical, then this film will give them much to be negatively critical about.
In Chabrol's film, such distinctions are so understated as to be lackluster, if not plain dull, a thematic failure that is only made the worse by characters who are lifeless and lacking in the telling character traits and hard-scrabble wisdom one expects of certain class types.
Only thing about the movie that is kinda disappointing is that I thought the ending of this movie actually betrayed the writer/director's unique style of low key and moderation/ showing something through nothing.
China is often shown as the high rises in the city, or the shanty towns on the fringe, Jia is the gifted few who show everything else in between as what they really are - and that is the real China most people don't care to see or don't want to see.
What ensues is a comedy of errors and misunderstandings that is just plain toe-curling embarrassing.
Although that isn't really needed int his film.
There is also a great conversation scene between two characters who don't share the same language, and the use of reflected light that is truly remarkable, make sure to watch for this scene.
He borrows heavily from Ozu, particularly a scene that is reminiscent of Tokyo Story and makes something that is uniquely his own.
I mean, it must have been a conscious decision because that is the end product.
However, from my perspective, what is happening in the film is much more subtle; it is form of art-making that is particular to China and its authoritarian governing systems through history.
There is prostitution, crime, and pirate copiers (maybe the theme here is modern Chinese society, as promoted by the government and big business, that is the pirated copy of the rest of the world).
As adults (they are played by Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Damian Lewis and Timothy Olyphant) they still have the powers and that is where the movie begins.
One of the best examples of this style is a grimy hotel room scene between the lead couple in which very little happens--an attempted seduction, but no sex--that is so authentic it feels almost voyeuristic to watch.
After I watched the whole movie, I was left with a feeling of emptiness, that is, the author's emptiness.
It is much too "talky" and "preachy" and it's lecturing to an audience that is already converted.
Director Joachim Trier uses a style that is distinctive, but I'm not sure it's good.
But the good acting goes to waste on a script that is dull, and directing that obscures the performances.
But that's not all that is bad about the movie..., there is more-the silly dialogues, lousy work by the lead pair, the female lead has no clue what to say or do, she often keeps mumbling and muttering in the background.
Even more despicable than that is when Ricky attacks a wheel-chair bound, facially scarred nun with an ax.
Other than that is a simply bad movie half fantasy and half real life with unrealistic scenes mixed in.
Sure the plot in general is kind of like an Indiana Jones film but that is where the similarities end.
But that is not enough for this terrorist.
Its bad but it starts to turn the corner and just be laughable and that is about all that can make you sit through this movie.
Now and then one of those wonderful films comes along that is so terrible it's good.
And that is precisely what happened here.
Hell, the bad guys get more lines than these guys, and that is pretty bad.
well that is a foolish way to think, the game based itself in some kind of reality and the movie should follow through in that CONTEXT.
One thing though that is timely.
Anne Rivers Siddons, writing about her excellent horror novel THE HOUSE NEXT DOOR, once observed that the really chilling thing about evil is that is smashes people and breaks up relationships, and the tragic message of horror is that sometimes even love is not enough to save someone.
I think that is the most memorable aspect of this episodic serial from the 1930's, as the rest appears to be rather common and what one would expect out of a serial of the period (cheap sets, cheap costumes and props, atrocious acting and simple plot lines).
As if that isn't bad enough the Irish 'science' people in this movie are from Queens College Dublin.
The potential family comes in to meet theirs and naturally they wonder why the older one isn't married yet, so the propose that one of their other sons marries her, that is when Rani's character drops the bombshell on them all that she is already married.
He had the nerve to say about an act what everyone in the audience was thinking, a quality that is sorely missing from every variety show of the current era.
The scenery was beautiful, but that is the only redeeming value I could find.
A some moments you feel like you're getting to know and like the characters, but then you get shot into a scene that is totally different from what you've just seen.
He was a dancer and danced with women prior to getting into movies, yes, that is true, but he wasn't the "clown" the way the movie puts him out to be in the movie.
The essence of capturing a romantic hero of the movies on film has seldom come off (proof of that is the unsuccessful 1951 version of "Valentino" starring Anthony Dexter); here, Russian ballet star Rudolf Nureyev struggles with his Italian accent, struggles with his romantic partners, and really only looks comfortable with the dancing (an early scene featuring Valentino and Vaslav Nijinsky together on the dance floor is the picture's best moment).
I bet she did that on purpose cause you die burning if you get hit by a thunderstorm I don't understand why she gets out of the house by herself in the middle of the night that is kind of against god's law and this girl is to cute, pretty in this movie to hit lots of people and die if It wouldn't have made a movie called "The good daughter" like the "The good son" and that will probably help spread the word to the little girl's actions and they said that the little girl is 8 and she looks like a 11 or 12 year old.
*Spoiler Warning*  Saathiya is a film about a couple who have the courage to follow their heart but discover themselves and each other - that is they mature - as they go along.
And since the kids did not really bond with me, that is, I never had the feeling of "knowing them" I never really cared.
But, even that is just a split second of viewing, to leave it rather questionable, as to if it was just a paint can.
The cardboard myth, the cinematic Potemikiniade, the clay-footed colossus that is Lucian Pintilie shows again his hideous and incompetent face.
I wish it had stayed that way, because once things start happening that is when the movie gets really annoying.
I would say the greatest drag on African development and food security today is the lack of land that is available to it's farmers.
Cate Blanchett looks like a million bucks; I don't think there's any doubt that she is, like Helen of Troy in her day, the most beautiful woman on the planet, but even that isn't enough to liven up this misdirected and clumsy adventure.
This film recently surfaced on Channel 4.I saw it when it came out and thought it awful then and my view has not changed.What grates with me is the fact that it trivialises the role that many brave women played in SOE.Cate Blanchett is approached on a train.Well that just would not have happened.She seems to have been sent to France without a defined role.One minute she is a courier then she is involved in the blowing up of the train.She is constantly asking people for their names,and then if that is not bad enough she tries to find out about her RAF boyfriend who is hiding in a French village.Then she becomes involved in trying to avoid the roundup of Jewish children.None of this is in any way true to life.Watch "Odette" or "Carve Her Name With Pride" to find a truer representation of SOE agents in France.
and like mentioned before, a suitable film to North Indian audiences and it is a film that is worth watching (though not as good as `Alai Payuthey').
BUT there was one who managed to be not only the most frightening of the bunch, but actually never managed to caveÂ until now, that is.
It's sloppily put together and for something that is supposed to be a horror thriller, lacks tension altogether.
I could tell though, before any of drivel that passed as "horror" in a franchise that isn't even supposed to be horror, that this movie would suck based on the Pinhead shirt one of the characters was wearing.
If you thought Jigsaw had some time on his hands to come up with some incredibly complex machines of torture, wait until you see the plot that is hatched by the Host (played by Lance Henriksen, who wastes his talent completely in this movie).
Confusing, that is what this cartoon was.
Kraken: Tentacles of the Deep is another creature feature that is virtually indistinguishable from any other, catch it on the Sci-Fi Channel for sure but don't go wasting your money on it.
Every once in a while, I'll see a low-budget independent "gay film" that is so lifeless that I am embarrassed for "my people."
It is obvious that this film had a household sized budget, but that is no excuse for poor dialogue hanging plot lines, disjointed direction, poor acting, and the list goes on.
As this is taking place after the battle of Endor, how can there be another Death star that is completely built up like the first one, when the second one was no where near completion?
Now I wanted to see this because I was curious since I liked the original so much, it is such a classic that is very under rated.
Though still amateurish, any attempts of a B-movie being 'stylish' differentiates it from a movie shot with a home video camera, and that is okay in my book, at least in that respect.
What we get is a movie that isn't a horror film, isn't a suspense or thriller, isn't much of a teen comedy...what it is is simply, perhaps an idea that sounded good on the drawing board, but completely failed upon execution.
The saddest aspect of She Hate Me is that so many talents (John Turturro, Ossie Davis, Isiah Whitlock), none greater than the wonderful composer Terence Blanchard, were wasted on a script that is at once ridiculous and insulting to the viewer.
This is when Lee and his collaborator get into the biggest pickle that they can never squirm out of, as up to now they have material that isn't terrific, but has some promise to be developed.
They do try, the women do, to rake up the laughs with their cheesy bed exploits, but it's meshed together into a premise that is so ridiculous to accept that it loses its energy very, very quick.
this is the only show ( at least i watched until now ) that not only helps to know how our favorite stars are... but also helps to develop the craft for professionals ( being and wanted to be ) and know the difficulty of the craft for non-professionals, you may ask why general public should know how difficult the craft is and that is because they are the people who comments ( usually bad ) on them.
Instead of being bitingly satirical about society's lopsided values, this is a mishmash of a film that is never as funny as it wants to be or as provocative as it should be.
There's a second act, so-to-speak, that tells the father's story that is interesting and better than the first and third acts.
And that is the problem in the end.
It's a shame because this film could have been a decent slasher film if the director had remembered that is what he was making...not a WB teen drama.
The frantically underlined Careful Research, and the general odor of educational intent, smother the valiant gestures at comedy, and the pricey period detail of the production design is wholly undermined by a dramatic arc that is pure 1980s bootstrap trash.
As a people, that is, diaspora Africans to the New World, the film questions, who are we?
It always gives me hope to know that there are still Canadian executives who, like Diane Boehm, are prepared to take a chance on Canadian talent that is relatively unknown in our so-called "mainstream", simply because it is Canadian.
A replay that is much, much worse.
The film is still reasonably fun though because it is so cheesy and they have some clichÃ©d and hokey drama in it that is so badly done you can't help but laugh.
Her consistent use of intimate scenes reminds the audience that such a universal theme is grounded in a specific location that is worthy of close-up attention.
Still, it may have been jarring, things such as the >1 year journey that is inside earths orbit also jarred me, but other than that first one I don't think the average viewer should have noticed, and unreal-ism, even in the case of this movie, shouldn't lose more than 1 point from movie's score, rather it was the plethora of other problems that doomed Sunshine.
I'm amazed that Danny Boyle has produced such a turgid and morose (quite boring) film (by his standards that is).
It's low-budget dreck, that is certain--but through its persistent incoherence, it kept my attention, even though the one feeling I had when the credits started to roll was absolute indifference.
Faust... is a miasma of eye-rolling sexcapades (dressed up in a way that is clearly meant to seem demonic, but that falls exceedingly short), poor and tired special effects, and a completely incomprehensible plot.
If that is his real name, shoot I wouldn't want to be known for this movie.
Ringo, buried under a mass of grey hair, long beard and pointy wizard's hat, is unrecognizable - that is, until he opens his mouth and his completely inappropriate Liverpool accent slurps out.
One woman who watches him transform before her very eyes does not even know any better than to run away, that is until it's too late.
Beyond a fabulous title, VAMPIRE HOOKERS is unredeemable, uninteresting crapola, and that is what Out of Print prior rental tapes were invented for.
Vampire Hookers is certainly a bad movie but that is part of its charm.
It's a poignant story that is not exclusive to Black Canadians, but to anyone concerned about the future of their community and the children growing up under similar conditions.
The movie is one of those incredibly lame "family movies" that is clearly designed for one target audience: infantile children who can't differentiate between quality and utter rubbish.
And what in all that is holy's name are actual actors like Paymer and Steiger doing here?
Anything that isn't a bloated American production?
The best song is by a band called the Young and Fabulous but even that isn't great.
Whatever you do, do not watch it for the "acting" as that is far too generous a word to use for what these people were doing.
There wasn't enough mistaken identity or confusion of the love triangles and that is what MSND is all about!
I was going to give them the excuse of having a low budget film but apparently that isn't true!
They impose the nyc style on everyone that is forced into the show.
A movie that is action packed, laced with great one liners and see's the good guys kicking ass over terrorist before it was popular.
They've expected anything...except John McClane there you see, that is running in the fire stairs with his serving gun and he's p***ed off!
Some other comments deplored his misogyny, but you have to understand that that is Clay's shtick.
It's a man who has a fear of women, playing to a crowd that is even more fearful.
The Australian waterfront has always been a complete shambles and this series - no real shock that is comes from the ABC - is almost entirely told from the trade union perspective.
I can't name one single explanation for his acts and that is rather frustrating once one has realized that.
Another area that is worth mentioning in Die Hard is the acting.
Another reason I didn't give it a low score of 1 because of a short that is on the DVD which in turn was pretty good.
With all of the garbage that is out there today, everything that Chicago did is better than the all of the claptrap of the 1990's or 2000's!
Almost each time he speaks, the camera avoids shooting his face, making us seriously think if it is his voice that is heard!
If certain people want to push their beliefs that is fine but to do it in an underhanded style such as this is disgusting and abusive.
This movie made me angry, and if that is the reaction you wanted your the same a the psycho killers.
And it has one of those endings that you think to yourself 'is that is?'
And unfortunately 'that is it'.
INstead the movie is a gratuitous torture porn flick that is constantly relentless.
The scene is then played out in a now grim way, leading to an ending that is so "original".
Overall action movies are always very similar and predictable, and this movie is too predictable, perhaps that is the only big weakness of this movie, because who can deny there is something special with Die Hard.
The over-the-top experience is gut-wrenching and terrifying, but that is the only real effect you are left with.
This point is already rendered practically untestable by the fact that there is no movie industry in the world that is quite comparable to Hollywood.
Seems like a real cheap Department if that is how they do things!
Then it turns into a family affair where every character is in relation of some sort with the other, with vague mention of a secret society that is not even fully exploited nor explained.
I mean, if that is not convenient scripting, I don't know what is.
The idea of how the heroes have their powers is ridiculous, putting it on a scientific theory that is an incomplete theory in the first place: "evolution" To say that a person needs the ability to fly is rather foolish as the brain is people's weapon, and if they want to go on Darwin's theory of evolution, they best realize that it's also "survival of the fittest" which goes into the idea of the food chain.
unfortunately that is were the good ends.
Looking at other people naked is a human urge that is unhealthy to suppress.
The whole Idea of a kid finding shoes that make him better and that is the ONLY reason for him to play good just bugs me.
Anything except their own instant gratification that is.
Yes, that is one hell of a cast but that doesn't really save this film anyway.
The Plot line is quite good for such an action-packed film, and it doesn't ever lose any of the intensity it starts out with, if it doesn't gain any that is!
The young actors all did a good job of representing their parts in a manner that is both believable and well-fitted.
The sequel begins with a raccoon gangster trying to recruit Dr. Dolittle into saving a forest that is going to be taken over by a lumber company.
This film should be a benchmark for ever other film that is out there trying to be an action film with a strong story, lets face it on paper it's a simple story terrorists want a building for money, they take it over, then John gets caught up in this mess...it's not hard really.
Dr Dolittle 2 is a sequel to Dr Dolittle which is a film very loosely based on the Rex Harrison musical (only in the whole "talking to animals" aspect, there is nothing else that is in any way even remotely similar).
You make a good point but without change the character that is Robert Goren would become stale and boring.
And that is definitaly not entertaining on ANY level.
I saw that it was the last of the pre-code big budget films, other than being the worst film ever made that is the only thing for which this film will ever be known  While watching through the interminably long end sequence, we are supposed to believe that this is a Broadway production, but there are so many inane camera gimmicks, that you know you are not watching something resembling a Broadway production, but something that comes across as a High School production which received a grade of D.  The acting in the movie is absolutely horrible.
He manages to thwart the bad guys while barefoot, man that is a great twist.
A tedious, plodding storyline concerning a plot to steal some diamonds from a German HQ, awful acting and dreadful editing make this movie a prize turkey from the opening scene right through to the cringeworthy oh-so-60s `romantic' ending which will have you reaching for the puke bucket - that is if you haven't already reached for the `Off' button long before.
I didn't find anything that is worth mention about this movie.
If you haven't seen any of the 'series' and feel the need to see any of them (whether or not that is a good idea for you to do is a whole different discussion) just see the first one.
Oh, and every once in a while, they stick in some stock war footage that is so grainy you can barely tell what's going on (I *think* that was a shot of something being blown up there...)  The characters look so much alike (I'm not saying this in a racist way -in the first movie, I had no problem, but here the screenwriting is so sloppy I didn't know who was who.
There's maybe one good though lurid scene in this and that isn't enough to make sitting through the movie to see.
It felt at some points that is is a porno film, but when any girl got half naked the scene ended.
(Although that is an insult to Michael Myers.)
They may have taken the "100 monkeys at typewriters" metaphor literally, because that is the only remotely feasible explanation I can come up with for this nonsense.
I actually feel a little bad reviewing this because I feel I'm only advertising it somewhat...like a lot of people curiosity got the better of me after reading the reviews...I have to say though it's a work of genius from the director to film a LOW low budget film and then come on here and deny he knew what the final cut of the film looked like...that had me on the floor...what great directing that is...
Did I mention the novel weapon is a toy crossbow that is vastly less menacing then the hunting crossbow on the promotional packaging?
And that is the lowest and most absolute zero I can give.
Combining these two concepts does not work, at least in the context that is set up in this story.
In real life that is just not going to happen.
There is no scene involving Paul Newman that is funny or interesting.
While based on a story by the noted Japanese author, Edogawa Rampo, Tsukamoto has made a tale that is more his own.
Well, after being jerked around through most of the film by Winfield and Waite, Mr. T becomes a tad perturbed and goes on a killing spree that is basically brainless entertainment.
While I'm not a fan of this kind of humour, it is testament to England's ability to produce quality programmes that is echoed the world over.
She gets VD and can't marry her fiancÃ©, that is until she's taken the cure.
It is difficult to identify a horror franchise that is more creatively bankrupt than the Texas Chainsaw Massacre series.
With both vehicles out of commission, and a power tool that is just itching to be covered in the thick red stuff right behind, they quickly begin wandering the woods and find a farm house containing (imagine this) crazy people!
Michelle and Ryan are almost non-existent characters, they are bodies for the slaughter and that is it.
I suppose it is a sad commentary on pop culture when the gruesome acts of despicable people on film has become so blasÃ© as to be boring, but that is where it stands.
The film has no visual interest, it's just random woods photographed with competence, and that is it.
This all changes when one of the young men of Goona, the son of that islands king,traveled to Wongo by canoe to get the men of both islands to united against an invasion of ape-men from another island.
George is an innocent, almost naive man who rarely makes it to the city, we learn, so was unaware that is such a dangerous play.
I suppose if that is your sense of humor, then it will go over very well for you.
The acting was amateurish and the dialog was lame Âthat is if you could understand it through all the mumbling.
2 out of 10 and that is just for the clever graphics.
This is a super-low budget film that isn't horrible, but it isn't particularly good either.
My theory is that they just needed a reason to have a man diving into a mirage that is really just hot sand to add to the sight gag of the kids plowing a wooden shack to the ground because they thought it was a mirage, just like the cavernous mansion that disappeared before their eyes earlier.
This is a zero budget, amateurish film that is laughably poor in parts.
I love every film I've seen with dummy's or dolls but this one just didn't hit the bar and pales in comparison to The Leprechaun, that is a franchise so bad its good.
A movie that is supposed to feel like a reality series comes off as a scripted poorly edited documentary.
For a movie that is of no interest whatsoever, this has quite a lot going for it, especially in the acting department: Larry Hagman, Susan Sarandon, Joe Don Baker et al are relaxed and agreeable.
Shame on all involved, and mostly on the United States Government that is JUST AS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE 9/11 INCIDENT as Al'Quaida, with their lapse, lazy security and their failure to handle a disaster of this proportion.
I just watched the laugh-fest that is 'Flight 93'.
This is one of those rare films (wait...don't leave I'm making a point) that is exactly what you think it is.
He plays a dumb jock that isn't even a good jock.
In my opinion, the only reason to see CUTTING CLASS is for Jill, wearing only a shirt to get the paper at the beginning of the film, and in a cheerleader uniform..that is far more entertaining than this lifeless, stale exercise in tedium.
If all that is not enough, there are other lures to consider - the blaring disco music; the groovy, circa-1979 clothes; the forced slapstick (in particular, a fruit-throwing mÃªlÃ©e and a very non-spontaneous pool dunking at a garden party).
I felt this was a very average quasi-silent movie that is in our hands today because the production design was a little more novel than most.
The only thing positive I can say about this programme is that it made me laugh, and I suppose that is a pretty decent positive, but how long will those laughs last?
There seems to be some need to spoof a complete film, so in Skateboarders from hell we get a climatic funeral scene that isn't very funny and destroys the laughs that the film had generated with the "biker" fight.
That said, the film is well made and interesting, that is no doubt why it won the Academy Award for documentary films.
that is, there's way too much of him, and not enough of William Shatner.
As they talk about the rain, his father stumbles home as his face starts to melt and he starts mumbling about some book and to give it to this man that is the high priest of some Satanic cult because it righfully belongs to him.
Then, out of the blue, there is an ending that is cool to watch but doesn't make much sense, but considering the film so far, who's to quibble about the ending?!
Needless to say, The Devil's Rain is an atrociously terrible slice of Satanism that isn't even saved by some extremely trashy 'melting' scenes.
For God's Sake someone make a film with real gay characters that is uplifting or enlightening or how about, just interesting.
Happily we are spared from the peek-a-boo nudity that is typical of these films: where the director goes to great lengths to get the actors naked then hide their nudity through awkward posing, clever placement of props, and so on.
Sometimes you get a groundbreaking idea that is poorly executed and a good idea is wasted.
Yes, all the shots are in focus, but that is the responsibility of the camera operator and focus puller.
As he learns of this gift he starts to save them and as expected that is where everything goes wrong.
This whole BOMB is nothing more than Sellers sheepishly sleep-walking through ninety-eight minutes in an unbelievably awful and offensive performance that is an unnecessary insult to the Indian ethnicity/nation/race.
Bad acting, bad directing, terrible characters and a shallow story, and that is just for starters.
Like many others, I was disappointed with the fact that for the big screen, almost all the elements which made the tv series "Mission: Impossible" so entertaining - the team ethos, the complex con-tricks, etc - were jettisoned in favour of a huge ego boost for the one man show that is Mr. Tom Cruise.
But worse than that is the empty feeling the 2 major set-pieces leave.
I *did* find some entertainment value in this... the movie is actually one of those rare flicks that is *so* bad that it's actually funny.
So it lingers in that limbo of movies that is ultimately forgettable.
The movie both meanders along AND moves very quickly(if that makes sense at all), or that is how it seemed to me, not a lot is explained along the way.
Sadly, that's not the case with the mountain of absolute TRASH that is the newer episodes.
we listen to the same music you Americans are into such as rap r&b rock pop dance etc we do not wear them crap clothes we wear normal clothes and designer clothes such as Gucci and most of all we are not into the sport polo only nerds are and we do not like Shakespeare at all Shakespeare is utter crap that nobody can understand and we do not say Ta-tar or would you like a cup of tea only retarded ones do!And that is basically what I've have got to say about this DO NOT SEE THIS film!Keep on chilling!
And Sandy Dennis--ah, Sandy Dennis--gives another carbon copy of her standard performance that is in essence one long twitch.
This is the sort of film that is praised for its treatment of lesbianism and for being Subtle and Nuanced and Deep.
Nothing to see here you can't see elsewhere, people... except for Julia Stiles doing the twist, that is.
Love Games is the kind of movie that is for either fans of soft-core or the devil.
All set amongst the splendid flowers and apparent tranquility that is Southern England.
Take away the scene with the fat man and you have, actually, a film that is decently indecent.
Adding to that is the terrible character designs.
Although some of the kids are genuinely talented, that is really beside the point.
Although some of the kids are genuinely talented, that is really beside the point.
Part and parcel with all that is the trouble with the romantic relationship between Hart and Susan, as played by Lindsay Wagner (who two years later would become television's original Bionic Woman).
One implausibility piled on top of another in a "feel good"/"right will triumph" pattern that is SO OVERWHELMINGLY dominant in American movies.
And most of all - the stories of the main characters brought tears to my eyes, and that is the greatness of any drama.
Everyone has time to flirt when there is a hot agent that is air borne around a hospital.
Contagion is one of those movies that is so terrible that one finds themselves loving it for the sheer comedic value it holds.
If one event occurs that defies all odds, that is fine for a movie; it adds a little "miracles are possible" feeling.
The most annoying aspect of the entire movie is its lack of scientific facts or supporting information (that is true), such as the movie's portrayal of the virus' effects on humans.
As for how believable the story line was, I'm not ashamed to say that is horrendously bad.
Well, the only comic thing I find about all that is that luck (because the way you look is destiny) can put a bad actor on top of the pyramid.
Honestly, that is not how you reason to eat anybody.
The only interesting part of this movie was the true story which inspired it, however, even that is lost in a never ending parade of cuts, fades and pointless scenes.
There is no tension, no frights and very little gore, and that is badly done.
Several scenes in particular are horrendous: like a Super Sweet 16 party equipped with an elephant that is so mind-numbingly retarded that I was sent into anaphalectic shock and needed as epi-pen to be revived.
Finally, the real atrocity in the Killing Fields that is Bratz is its includence of one Jon Voight.
On top of that, some parents decided to tag along because of the perception that is was good for the entire family...
i had high hopes for two came back.obviously the ending is predictable,given the title.basically,a group of friends agree to sail a yacht for someone from san diego to vancouver.along the way,they get caught in a massive storm and all but two of them perish.the main focus of the story centres not so much on the storm,but its aftermath.the crew is left adrift in the middle of the ocean and struggle to survive,as they hope to be rescued.of course as days pass,each of them deals with their plight differently and eventually,when they are rescued there are only two remaining alive.that is the gist of the story.i thought it would be a better movie than it was,but it was mostly a bore.most of the actors weren't convincing.then again,they didn't have a lot to work with dialogue wise,so they can't be faulted entirely.the scenes of the storm were pretty exciting,but fairly brief.pre teens will probably enjoy this movie, but if you are in your mid teens and older,don't expect to be too entertained.
To give them credit, they're struggling against a script that is about as bad as the worst of any Harlequin Romance.
She was absolutely monolithic, that is, one face, one emotion, one tone of voice.
The dancing is alright but that is it.
However, the aspect that really brings the movie down is the seriousness that is laid on extra thick in nearly every scene.
The production values themselves seem relatively OK, its just the story and acting that is weak beyond belief.
Again, this has nothing to do with hip hop, it has one scene where a white guy raps and that is all, so where the title came from I do not no.
A colleague tells me I should burn them, and that is perhaps the best thing to do, but perversity wills me to preserve them, to torture myself.
Why make a film that is so murderously non interesting?
If that is okay with you parents let the kids watch, if not..
But that is up to the parents to decide.
Well, there is nothing horror about it - besides the camera work and acting that is.
The character "Laura" (Elizabeth Shue) is a little strange, really stupid and at the end mad (big surprise), that is it.
The only reason European-Americans like it is for fear of being branded a "racist" because they don't enjoy a mini-series that is not good in the first place.
The movie's concept, which is told from inside a group of exiled 'mutants', is not done in any way that is new.
The main plot, which I guess is closest to a who-done-it, is pretty weak too, is short on clues and has an ending that is really telegraphed.
To see this movie gave me the feeling of what it was like during this time in our history that is sad at what the Jewish people went through.
Most infuriating of all, it projects a Britain that is entirely white and middle class.
Finding himself hungering for blood, he seeks revenge on a shadowy group that is ultimately responsible.
The action sequences, if that is indeed what they can be called, are plodding, poorly thought out and mostly non-existent.
but I always have a good time watching it, because it is just so fun to notice everything that is wrong in this film.
I truly enjoy seeing the efforts of independent movie makers, people like Jon Keeyes or "The B Movie Master himself", Ed Wood, working hard to provide something that is entertaining, or informative, or challenging, or maybe even a combination of those.
But worst of all, the film suffers from "name-calling syndrome," that is, characters who know each other constantly and annoyingly use each other's names in normal conversation --just to make sure we don't ever confuse any of this with reality.
Dustin Hoffmann is trying his best but he can't save the mess that is "Moonlight Mile".
Not bad, but not especially noteworthy--that is until the dopey ending.
If that isn't enough, f-bombs drop everywhere.
The whole concept just didn't work as far as I'm concerned & the film spent a good 30 minutes explaining it's own set of Vampire 'rules' as Grant would ask a question like how to kill a Vampire & Gray would tell him thus making sure we, the viewer that is, know as well.
Until today, that is.
You think perhaps if native americans had a very powerful militaristic state that is subservient to u.s. power there would be more native american genocide memorials?
I'm not sure this deserves a point, but heyÂ  1 out of 10  post scriptum: I realize that is sort of a prolonged sketch and that therefore a chick and an old fart play the teens, but as a film that sort of crap just don't work!
Acting is below substandard, humor is absent in every scene and the script should have been burned after the first reading, after the scriptwriters had been shot that is.
You can't root for Cinderella to win the prince since that is certainly no bargain for her.
Well that is interesting that this was supposed to be a sequel to that movie, though it most definitely does not play out like the famous cartoon at all.
Its a boring mess that is quite possibly the worst post-apocalyptic film of all time.
And that is my two cents on another sterling Aussie gem.
A film using an active volcano as a backdrop for a drama is an original idea but it is about all that is good in this film.
But that is not enough to save some of the more clichÃ©d scenes.
This is an intriguing story concept that is completely wasted.
It even has a home movie within this home movie that is a musical rendering of worst kind.
is a Peruvian film that is really a stylish soap opera.
There was also unnecessary sexual innuendo of a minor that was not vital to the plot and that is just wrong.
This is not the Rocky we know and love, this is a derivative piece of junk that is detested by fans (both hardcore and casual).
This movie would have been plenty creepy if there was some payoff every so often, but unfortunately it just keeps building up and building up to a climax that is neither particularly scary or surprising.
Flesh, that is.
The film is of the slow build variety, but that isn't the problem in itself - the problem is that there is never enough going on to keep the audience wanting to see what happens next, and therefore the film does drag on far too often.
(I know I mispelled her name...sorry) The warden had this thick gob of gel that is used to simulate sweat, but it never moved in all the close-ups he had.
If this movie stayed on that issue more and tried not to tackle 4-5 other problems going on in prisons today, I think it would have been a better movie.
perhaps this is trying to portray Tom talking for his own benefit as well as others, convincing himself of that things he's saying are right & for the best, but even if that is the case it just came off as downright annoying.
When all the bad elements are all put together you get an incredibly idiotic movie that is fun to watch BECAUSE it's so bad.
Among the psychics there is also Linnea Quigley (who has the usual shower scene) and she is in the finest scene of all the movie, that is overacted by most of the cast (that is not very good at it).
The final act of the flick is a drawn out chase in the subways that is anything but exciting.
The two slacker best friends are cringe worthy - at attempt at indie quirk that is too forced and self conscious.
"Condor" had a hard and realistic edge to it that is missing in "Interpreter".
I like the way they presented the story because it is the fist time that I watched a movie that is taken from an actual UN meeting.
There is a sequel, not so sure I'll give it a chance based on the huge flaw of this script that is specifically due to one character..a character that could be had by anyone after enough liquor on a Saturday night.
There's a really bad scene where four people play two pianos at a party - it just goes on and on forever in the most unrealistic way, and then you realize that the whole interminable scene was constructed to set up a punch line that is only mildly amusing.
Cyclone features one scene in particular that is as cruel a scene as I've ever seen.
There is nothing that is even gently used.
Why can't they break free of this particular fantasy and create a high school that is just a little more interesting and believable?
It's used to end a play - a play that is supposed to be controversial, by the way, but which clearly isn't - written by a student.
I could go on for several pages about all that is wrong with that scene, but I won't.
Half the fun of The Sixth Sense was the action leading up to the surprising ending (which wasn't even that shocking), and that is where 13 Seconds suffers.
If you just want something bad to laugh at, this may be for you that is if you don't fall asleep.
The only chance this movie had a chance to be even a 2 was is if it lasted 13 seconds, and that is including the credits.
If you look at the rating percentages, there are next to no 8's and 9's, which is a very good and reasonable score for a movie that is as good as some say it is.
No, the only significant positive rating that is given is a 10, which makes no sense.
The cheesy eighties clothing that is trying to pass for street clothing of the period was great!
What makes this movie so bad is the fact that is just really missed the mark of capturing the essence of breaking.
And maybe one of these days when I'm extra bored I'll watch chapter 2...that is if I haven't used the laserdiscs for frizbees by then.
"The Claim" is a movie that is very much like a full cup of water in its beginning, but by the end of the movie one realizes that there is a hole at the bottom of the cup because everything has dribbled away.
This movie is an offense even to the teenage genre, it's about a mind controlling chip that is installed to the small town high school rebel students, turning them into "A" students, football jocks and cheerleaders in a scheme for world domination, so, see it a your own risk.
Soon, a secret that is only mildly disturbing is uncovered.
"Nostalghia" is an overly pretentious non-story that is far too self-indulgent even for a European director.
This version of the film, which gets about everything from the novel wrong in spite of a competent cast and some good location shots, is one that all of its participants -- all who are still living, that is -- seem never to mention.
But that is not the worst of it.
Of course not, that is why this is a B-movie.
The ending is predictable, preposterous and unfortunately resolves nothing and is a mere cheap tug at the heart strings which suckered in most of the reviewers here with "style" that isn't impressive.
It is better than the companion feature, but that is damming with faint praise.
The hearse itself is just a plot point that isn't really explained.
However, if I ever see this movie for sale someday I will buy it just so I can see it again and see what the story was about as that is something that for the most part escapes my mind at the present time.
I'm not sure if that is a good thing.
The women in this are beautiful but that is the only thing this film has going for it.
This was a waste and its really a film that is in the same level as soft core porn and pay-per-view masturbation films.
If you've read a review that says that 'If you likes the first one, you'll like the second one' the only reason that is is because IT IS THE EXACT SAME MOVIE!
If you have a chance to see it for free, and you're a straight guy, it could be worth checking out, if you want something erotic that isn't porn.
What was presented was everything that is wrong about adaptations in film.
If you want to see this produced correctly rent the original that is finally available after 20 years of petty arguing between the writers and PBS or read the book.  
There is also a golf bit that is supposed to be funny - it may have been a little funny the first time but when they pulled the same bit at the end all it did was elicit eye-rolling moans in our little audience.
Thankfully a few of Saget's crew actually rise to the occasion, that is to say that they do not let their hubris get in the way of embracing the full-on stupidity of the project.
There are teeny bits of hah-hah in it, but they are utterly lost in the Antarctic wasteland that is "Farce of the Penguins".
But, really, that's all that is funny, the concept of the film.
I know this movie is aimed at young kids, but that is not an excuse for the movie being bad.
This is one "forgotten" film that is best forgotten--it's only a curiosity for cinemaniacs (and VERY hard to find on video, but I've managed to buy a copy).
But in this way it poetically conveys within it's form the artificiality of power and sex, the dead end that is pleasure without sentiments and sensibility.
This was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally / usually seen in one of their biographies.
Please people, stop watching this and all other reality shows, they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create.
It would take a cryptologist to follow three quarters of the dialog, my head kept spinning, the pestle with the mestle has the brew that is true, et cetera et cetera et cetera, as the King of Siam would say.
But make no mistake, encourage you to watch this movie, in fact that is a MUST.
In all the chaos of tossing the characters about, leaving out essential scenes, people, quotes and other details,they inputed two major scenes that is not in the book, but it would be a bit unfair to say that they are bad, because they're not.
Harry does hide the Half-Blood Prince's Potions Book in the Room, but not at the time that is stated in the book.
Evil plot Quitich cup match, unless that is the match shown in the movie but you couldn't tell The alterations in the film are also a huge let down.
Warner's Brothers B unit goes for a straight exploitation plot, but manages to stay within the Production Code nonetheless, resulting in a movie that is neither amusingly salacious nor particularly well made -- a look at the plot outline offered by the Internet Movie Database will give you a rough idea of how silly and coincidence-actuated it is.
That's the impression you get after viewing this self-important bundle of cliches that is as tired as it is arrogant.
Any woman that is pretty deserves to die, right?
Although there was nothing terrible about the movie, there was nothing really good about it either, and I guess that is what stays in my mind.
There are some interesting fight scenes but that is about the only positive aspect of the movie.
  Let me tell You, Norway is a country that is good in many things, but filmmaking is not one of them.
It's hardly gore, false scares or daft teenagers... heck, there's some of all of that within the first five minutes, *and* gratuitous nudity to boot(something that is a rarity in the newer slashers, but somewhat dominant of the older ones, or so I've been told).
But in my opinion, a movie with such good potential ended as a mediocre B-movie that is only one of the bunch.
If all that isn't enough, Sharkey shows up in the clinic as well (as a fake doctor) and uses his charms on other patients to get rid of Susan.
Not to forget the Nazi symbolism that is present throughout the film with the evil biker dudes.
Inevitably that is also used for a sexual encounter, and it's one that's more than strange.
And that is what makes BHD a horror movie rather than a war movie really.
Plenty has been written about the 'Fog of War'--that is, the fact that when the bullets start flying, not only do politics go out the window (regrettably the politics seems to have gone out the window when the film cameras started rolling as well), but so also do the best laid plans and what small levels of good sense there were to begin with.
You cannot make a movie that is nothing more than a two-hour shoot-out.
Unlike "Apollo 13," this is not a "successful failure," but became a success (financially, that is) by being such a typical exercise in Hollywood sensationalism.
JB: Opens with an action scene that is the climax of his previous mission.
Craig is portraying Bond like he was already in all secret services, killed a million opponents, learned every small trick, but this is the beginning of how he became a spy (that is explained for only 2-3 minutes at the beginning and this had to be developed further).
Judy Dench is looking old and completely out of place in a film that is supposed to go back to the beginnings of Bond.
Along with exploring the psycho-dynamics of the individuals and their subsequently conflicted relationships, the film places the viewer at a level of detachment which promotes compassion for all of the principals - as well as a sense of forgiveness that is Christian in the very best sense of that word.
French Stewart proves once again, like he did in the excrement that is Home Alone 4, that he falls well short of the charisma and energy of his character and came across as rather wooden.
And that is sad.
Zamm also tries to create a Dr. Claw that is closer to the original Â but the trouble occurs with the fact that the two share very little screen time and thus there is no real chemistry between the two.
I give Sudden Fury a rating of 2.5 out of 10 for being so irksome for so much of the time, but generously add an extra half point for its gratuitously violent content, the so-crap-it's-funny sex scene between troubled hit-man anti-hero Walker and a coke-addled hooker, several hilarious jungle warfare flashbacks that look as though they were filmed in the local woods (because they were), and a full-body burn stunt that is actually pretty impressive.
This is a lazy effort which is not at all credible and that is the film's problem.
One of his "party" has a problem with the illegality that is going on.
And that is why we see Porky Pig in 'Old Glory' studying and dreaming of the greatness of his country.
I realize this show is a reality joke that is meant to be funny... however what bothers me is that Kenny cheats in every competition.
The jokes, if that is what they were meant to be, are like beached dead jelly fish - lifeless and limp.
The only thing that is half-decent is the special effects, or rather, the sci-fi bits from the future, and the passable intro with the meteors hurtling through space and plunging into the Earth.
Oh my God, that is hysterical!
Now that is how you make a sequel and (re)energize a franchise, ladies and germs, as well as create an exciting DVD menu.
He's assigned to the pursuit of a powerful vampire queen that is searching some black crucifix to perform a ritual which will enable her to be invulnerable to sunlight (is almost a sequel of Vampires (1998) directed by John Carpenter and starred by James Woods), Derek start his quest in the search of the queen with some new friends: Sancho (Diego Luna, really bad acting also) a teenager without experience, Father Rodrigo (Cristian De la Fuente) a catholic priest, Zoey (Natasha Wagner) a particular vampire and Ray Collins (Darius McCrary) another expert vampire hunter.
Ivan Zuccon doesn't achieve to grab the viewer's full attention and hold it, and that is something quite important in Lovecraft adaptations, as his morbid stories are habitually confusing and tangled already.
Not that I expected a quality production from someone like Franco but I did think this was going to be one of those films that is 'so bad it's good.'
The attempts at humour are forced, painfully at times, the supporting cast also exaggerate their playing, none more so than the choice hunk of ham that is Zero Mostel as the movie moves episodically and elephantinely to its even more improbable ending (a safe-deposit bank employee gets hypnotised by the floor-selection buttons in a lift...!).
Maybe that is one of the main problems, that Sunset never knows exactly what it's supposed to be.
On the other extreme is an appearance by Mariel Hemingway that is so bad it might have been what inspired model Kathy Ireland to give acting a try.
Why does the blackmailing girlfriend have a wound that is freshly bleeding in 2002 from a wound that happened in 2000 In the alternate reality??
Jackie has some good moves and there are a couple of very pretty gels to look at for a few moments, but that is about the qualities that are to be found in this movie.
I would say go see it if you like mystery that is not that Gory,Bloody Has lots of language, and Not that Scary.
And that is a shame.
The film follows Rachel Keller into Oregon where she tries to forget the events of the first one, but then Samara shows up wanting a mommy... and that is the point of the film.
And that is exactly what this film is.
It was stupid that battle lines were drawn politically and Scrubs rarely introduces hot button topics into its shows- that is what makes it timeless and classic.
and that is that it was long boring pointless and STUPID STUPIDS STUPID STUPID STUPID STUPID!!!
Now Just when you think the plot gets going somewhere, there's another cut to the bad guy (presumably the bad guy, he's really a scrawny kid) with his henchmen dropping nun-chucks on their feet and weather he's real or not isn't entirely clear as we cut once again to the 3 main characters and another training montage that is entirely identical to all the others before it.
Pocket Ninjas is one of the few movies that is so bad it's good.
This is a film that is lacking in continuity, plot details, plot points, developed characters, and sense.
There is a unique fight sequence that takes place in a balloon room that is worth seeing.
You are now the proud owner of a car that is good enough for any gay-pride parade!
As for using the word "pimp" as a verb and all that, well what's to say that is new?
I guess that the car looks better after they are done, but that isn't saying much.
Despite an ending that is (somewhat) promisingly bleak, and the so-real-it's-real turn by Krista Grotte as guest porn star Kristy Luv (who may be a real porn star, I'm not sure, definitely looks the part), it's all second-rate at best.
I've got no problem with this in theory and indeed some of the 'fake' Emanuelle films (fake rip-offs of rip-offs could only be made in Italy) are very good - but that is not the case here, as Emmanuelle on Taboo Island is really very boring.
The only thing in this movie that is the least bit entertaining is the kid (Demian Slade) who keeps telling his parents how dumb they are.
Put the two of them together in a trite, weak script that is supposed to be a "light as air comedy" and you get messy results.
Same here: While this film contains fascinating, evocative scenes of Chasidic life that most people would never see in person, it is an inferior film that is full of improbable plot elements, cultural blunders, characters who are mostly mere sketches, and mostly pedestrian cinematography.
At some points I pondered leaving the cinema, but like a car wreck it's hard to stop watching, that is probably the strength of the movie,it's not bad enough to drive you out of the cinema.
I don't want to tell more than that about the movie, but now on the trailers you see a lot of wars in Jerusalem, but that is only very short time of this 2.31 hour long movie .
Has Claire already returned to the house and found the mess that is there or not?
And that is quite an achievement.
Music  I am a person that is very fond of classical music, and have also interest in orchestral music in movies.
However, everything that is wrong here far outweighs the good.
You can tell that a lot of care was taken to achieve beautiful shots and that is greatly appreciated.
Any decent horror movie worth its salt has suspense, or tries to utilise it because that is what terror is all about, the long silences waiting for something to happen, the build up to it... Poltergeist 2 simply does not even try in this area,For example when carol Anne sees Kane at the mall, menacing and staring at her, in order to build up the tension, Director Brian Gibson didn't need to show us that Kane was a ghost, any director with any idea of suspense would have let us make up our own minds, as soon as we see Kane walking through people and things we know straight away what he is and any suspense vanishes.
No matter what the budget, no one should make a Star Wars movie that is this bad.
The Plank by Eric Sykes is one of my favourite Comedy Shorts so I was very glad when I found that a DVD version was available - that is until I actually bought one with the intention of replacing my ageing copy of The Plank on VHS tape.
And that is not to say that this is an award winning performance; it isn't-- but it is credible, and Scott does about as well as anyone could with the material he's given to work with.
The tone is very lighthearted and the plot dumb enough that you would think it was made for children, that is, until a few soldiers are slashed by the samurai and the Bluto guy snaps a few necks.
However this movie...  1) This is the second time they released a movie with Starship Troopers title that is ABSOLUTELY rubbish.
Don't say to me that is a good sequel, because its not, its a fucklng shlt!!
I would say that is a disgrace.
I told my sister who was with me at the time, "I think that is the BEST Bollywood film I have seen so far".
It was a TV movie and that is what to expect of it.
After an earthquake in a city that is mostly unprepared for such an event, one would think there would be a great deal more devastation.
Of those 8 or 9 movies perhaps you get one that is even worth a look, if you're lucky.
I strongly recommend you pay a visit to the nearest cinema that is showing it, sit back and enjoy you'll love it.
And it's just a cool idea - a series about a Sports show that isn't about Sports.
Also, the story of Sid is kept on the sidelines, while in the true essence of the film, that is the story which is the most honest and strongest one.
They espouse a cultish theology that is at best only superficially Christian.
The fact that one of them was from Orlando should tell you something considering that is where the filmmaker is from.
Perhaps, and it is an easy conclusion to reach, that is the only type of films they know how to make well.
It does the best it can on a budget of about ninepence, but that isn't very good.
This movie had realistic characters with realistic emotions who were written very well, but no realistic moment where you can say that is a mirror of my life.
Sad to see John Carpenter having to revert to the the technique in which sudden appearance of off screen subjects/objects that is plainly visible to the character on screen in order to give us a scare.
Akram Sheikh asks Rachit to lead him to the secret passage into the jail , that is located below sea level .
Not worth seeking out but if it is all that is on, it is fun to watch good actors try to make something of this.
hello I'm from the Dominican republic and I saw that movie called : la malicing del padre car dona and my opinion is that movie is very bad movie ..the script is horrible the acting roles are bad very bad  that is the worst movie done in the Dominican republic that happen cause the director of this movie use people who use to work in the TV not people who really acting in movie or something like that..the movie is very boring..is an empty comedy without any history to tell this movie has a lot of technician errors...  this comedy cant make you laugh..may be cry for lost your money going to see this mess..please stop doing movie like this this is a shame for our country
Maybe some people think it funny because it is so bad... but even that is not possible with this 'movie' in my opinion.
For a supposedly WB event Dick Powell/Ruby Keeler, it is very cheap looking as if all the money went into extravagant looking Bubsy Berkeley inspired number that is dull.
But how those writers are stupid that is amusing... to whom you try to sell this stupidity?
I can't see anything animated that is worse for a child to see.
Vincent Riverside has a screen presence that is commanding.
The smacked up heroin addict, that is his old pal and sister's boyfriend seems either cold turkey or 100% with it, and i'm sure would be seen as a poor example of why not to do heroin by people who have been through such troubled times.
Even if it's not a declared war, our people are out there dying in a hellhole that is Iraq.
For the little bit of "story" that is there, it does nothing but to string together jokes which are either weak or stolen from other places, sitting in sequence in a disjointed, incoherent manner.
If that is what you are looking for, this movie is a flop.
And, that is what we have here - a most annoying movie that borders on a very bad nightmare brought to life.
But little, not even the location filming in South Africa, can save this by-the-numbers film, especially with a climax that is...well, just not climactic.
Extensive cuts, abominable presentations, impenetrable dubbing, re-editing by distributors who were too clueless to just leave the movie alone, and content that is too oblique for traditional critical appraisal.
When I think of pods, I think of long sacs or chrysilii (whatever the plural for that is) that the aliens burst out of.
Second, I have seen Monster a-Go Go, and that is far worse than Pod People.
The main characters are a couple of 20-year-olds who are part of an awful band (they have a terrific musical number that is possibly the best part of the movie where the lyrics are incredibly inaudible They go into the mountains for a camping trip, and run into what seems to be some poachers and then find a cabin in which they stay with a family that has one young kid.
I would say that is enough to give it a 2 instead of a 1, and besides it wasn't as bad as "Overdrawn at the Memory Bank."
It's got a highly derivative plot that is derivative in all the wrong ways - what's the point of ripping off E.T.
"The Pod People" is a movie that is so extremely bad, you'll OK the TV and yell out at the top of your lungs, "It stinks!!!!!!"
However, if you don't think they'll enjoy seeing a guy get hit on the head repeatedly with a brick and have 1000 volts pumped into him while using the sink (that is just SO funny) then you might want to look into something else.
I think that is the proper word as far as this movie is concerned.
...hahaha if that isn't hilarious I don't know what is.
a great movie for a Friday night at 2 AM when you've had one too many drinks and you're ready to make fun of anything that isn't yourself.
No doubt the cast have nothing but kind words about working with Sara Sugerman but you don't make a movie to enjoy yourself - You make a movie to let the audience enjoy themself and there's no enjoyment here as we have to endure silly performances , MTV style direction in a very plot less and episodic story that is a kick in the guts to anyone who has struggled to make it in the movie business in this country   But at least MAD COWS proves once and for all that it's not what you know in the British movie industry - It's who you know
that is not the worst part of the sequel the worst part is th really annoying slow motion glitch you get when you go around corners or put the foot down when you pull away from a standing position.
quite simply this is worse than Alterd Beast for the megadrive if that is possable.
One of those thrillers that isn't half as clever as it thinks it is, and which half the time leaves you wondering what the heck is going on.
It documents the mischiefs of a group of children that is only weakly related to the Holocaust, that they who could have been anyone in any place.
The plot is weak to start with, and spirals out of control into unforgivable chaos that is beyond redemption.
The resultant fake Polish accent in "Edges of the Lord" is a strange chimera that is very unpleasant on the ears.
Yet amazingly this is done in a manner that is surprisingly un-sleazy, which is about the only thing I would fault the movie for: It's not sleazy enough, and ultimately too stupid to actually take seriously.
LOL that is the most stupid thing i heard, you really think they would not survey rivers?
The dog is a random addition that is every bit as disconnected to the "story" as I was.
And what a deal that is!
At the helm is Shahid Kapur and his lady love interest (in a story that is never explored but only hinted at) Ayesha Takia.
Though there are snippets of originality that come in the form of the directorial technique, they are pale in comparison to the quick editing techniques and framing that is used by Ritchie in "Snatch".
The material has dated badly too, so the director should not be blamed for everything that is wrong with this production.
One of the subplots added for the screenplay is about the sharecroppers trying to develop a strain of tobacco that is pre-mentholated.
Yes, there is a lot of moralizing here, and if you don't know by now that giving your best weapons to your worst enemies because you are afraid of them is not an intelligent thing to do, then this movie will hammer that obvious point home and do it with a psychopathic vengeance that is firmly rooted in the belief that every dead horse requires a really good beating!
And that is basically it.
An uninteresting, not deeply explored character that is the so-called sophisticated lady (wishful thinking here!
The first two attributes should apply to a good portion of the women he's been dating Â his students, that is Â and as for the third, if he's the playboy we're meant to believe he is, this should be nothing new either.
sure, Kevin is getting older, but that is nothing compared to how mad Marv and harry are.
Starting with the positive: X is pretty to look at and has a great premise - the two opposing sides that make up the narrative have valid reasons for doing what they do, rather than the "we're good and they're evil" style of anime plot writing that is very common.
The whole film is just about one event that is supposed to happen, when it does, its crap and lasts about 10 seconds.
This film, however, was a complete waste of time and I cannot believe that CLAMP actually agreed on summing up the immense plot of the comic books in to one film that is not even two hours long.
One of my favorite parts is when Kevin fools the Corcierge with that cool song "Cool Jerk" - that is hysterical!
I will state (and prepare for the negative backlash) that I have not seen, but would very much like to, the accompanying mangas and series, because there is something about X that lurks in the background amidst all the faults that is desperately trying to get out, and desperately trying to impress itself upon you as the viewer, but just doesn't quite make it.
What we are left with after that is a weak attempt to recapture the audience that IV, V, and VI enthralled.
He fights with a cool double light-saber, but that is all.
I've explored the plot contradictions that destroyed what could have been an amazing series of films, but that isn't the only thing that destroyed it.
And I won't waste any space talking about the apocalyptic disaster that is Jar Jar Binks.
What you get is a post 1960's sleaze film that is not even all that sleazy by today's standards.
John Hughes makes his movies in a way so they are directed at an audience that is the same age as the main character.
I bet that is what Will Shakespeare intended.
If one believes that every thing is preordained, then that is the only way the plot would have worked, that the characters had no control over their lives.
There's just smoothing about this one that is so much better than the first.
There is some light grain here and there but that is where the trouble stops.
The only reason I can think of that the Jury gave this movie the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, is that is is different from anything else at the festival.
But the Wet Bandants who have now re-named themselves as the Sticky Bandants are in New York as well and are planning on stealing all the money from a toy store that is going to be given to the children's hospital.
Bela is in good form as a hypnotist/magician and of course he gives it his all in this dismal movie that is too long at 59 minutes.
Bela Lugosi gives a great performance as always, I am not sure if even that is capable of redeeming this movie -- especially when the nagging thought kept running through my head that surely someone could have found something better for this great actor to do than this drek.
Scared to Death is a poor murder mystery, has no horror elements in it & is stuffed with annoying comedy that is anything but funny.
Soon they discover that there's actually an all different purpose to their visit as they encounter an alien on that island.
The drug taking; threatening innocents at home; baby rejecting disaster that is Katrina struts about and moves into seducing Kenny for her own dirty work; we are not amused and we are not enthralled and we cannot believe what we're seeing.
Only good thing about it is that is all natural, which gives us somewhat soft touch.
There are characters with nothing to do except get naked in front of the camera (and I don't have a problem with that) but don't try to deceive us by saying that is the 'great performance of their careers'.
when you throw those characters into a plot that goes nowhere, and you end up with something that is a train-wreck of Uwe Boll proportions.
Jeff Ltd. was a terrible show with above all a terrible performance by the lead character that is what I remember most of all about this show.
It's a comedy that isn't funny first of all.
None of the characters are likable and that is okay because you can have a comedy show with unlikeable people but the characters aren't funny either.
A D+ is the final grade, and that is being charitable in every capacity possible.
Now that is definitely worth the wait.
This time he plays a hard edge cop that is scared.
The film starts out with people talking about a disease that is killing everyone on the planet.
His creations may share that frustrated stammer and that tendency toward animated behavior that is so `Lemmon,' but beyond and beneath that, he has the ability to bring a definite sensibility to his characters that makes each of them unique.
Hai ram--if you appreciate literature or poetry, if you have any respect for the craft of writing, then you will most likely wince at the trickling treacle that is served to us as (presumably) exemplary writing.
The movie does portray a world that is now so very complicated in the raising of children, but the writer needs to move beyond mere events and situations.
Not that is unforgivable
So if this is another bit of inconsistency in regards to the script, I understand: translate a play that is meant to show how weak the gentry/women can be by showing how far they can fall upon the slightest suggestion into a film that shows no distance between where the gentlewoman had begun and ended.
However, the monologue that is meant to be the climax of the play was poorly built within the realm of the movie.
Unless you're wanting to spend money to see every last inch of Clive Owen, surely available somewhere on the internet, there isn't anything here that isn't done much better elsewhere.
This movie was nothing but a predictable pile-up of meaningless eyecandy that is really nothing special compared to any other shallow blockbuster.
Not only are many of the effects lacking any believability but Lucas can't direct action, something that is a major flaw in a film that has perhaps half of it as action scenes.
Palance totally overacts; and that is the best thing I have to say.
In the IMDb 100 Worst, that is.
!If those of you, who's still having life pumping through your veins,are going to watch this worthless pile of crap, be prepared for a couple of scenes in particular that is probably some of the greatest comedy ever put on screen; the scene with "evil" genius getting angry at woman for having a dog, the scene in which "evil" genius and woman is attending a concert together, and right after, the scene in the carriage.
You cannot think about anything else but the craziest that is happening on screen.
But that is no reason to rent it.
I do not think there is a single aspect of film-making that is not violated by this movie.
Many early sound films suffer from varying sound or sound that is simply too soft, as they had still to work out all the ins and outs of the new medium.
In fact, it is not even in the top 10, and that is just getting started.
Dreamworks needs to stop delving into the animated world for a while and give the movie going public something to look forward to that is actually worth their time.
This is a very low budget Spanish version of Dracula that is chock full of breasts--sort of like a nudie version of a horror film.
not surprisingly this retread of a formula that is as old as the hills has very little originality.
Before I ever ran across the Barbie movies, I would have never heard this name, but that is the miracle for being willing to watch any movie out there.
Perhaps that is the only reason I managed to endure all the way through Riders of the Storm.
You better get used to this whining, because mostly that is gonna be what you hear during the rest of the movie.
It is a film that is difficult to categorize.
Sean Connery plays the role of Arthur but brings nothing to the part that is interesting, and walks around stiff and delivers his lines like he wants to speed things up.
Richard Gere as Lancelot has to be the one of the worst casting mistakes in movie history, that is if you discount John Wayne as Ghengis Khan (and the "Surely this must be the Son of God!"
We have definitely found something Jordan can't do and that is act.
Generally speaking, I enjoy it when film makers expose a fringe subculture that is basically unknown to the general viewing audience.
More than anything else, we get a story of aged obsession, hypnotism and throat spray that is as flavorless and stale as a slice of month-old Sachertorte.
It is a tired plot, mostly because there is little chemistry between Foster and Karloff (although that is not a fatal flaw - he is fixed on her, she need not show any type of fascination towards him).
just dumb and violent stuff, thank you very much), stars in this film that is kind of about immortal bad guys.
The movie is severely hampered by Mr Mastroianni's pedestrian direction that is without suspense, tension or the ability to invoke emotion.
There's nothing new in this story but that is not what makes it a bad film.
I had given this 3/10 but now that I've written about it I realise that is too generous 2 is all it's worth despite the odd amusing reference to True Romance that has been slipped in.
The strangely Byzantine plot doesn't take itself too seriously, and writer/director John-Paul Nickel takes the opportunity to send up romantic comedies and Indy films alike, while making a movie that is arguably both.
Lise, thus far not experienced in the ways of the flesh, has a crush on Gwen that is not returned, and then punishes Gwen for spurning her interest by sabotaging Gwen's "romances".
Anyway, Android of Notre Dame is no better than the others, and it isn't particularly disgusting either, and that is a achievement when we're talking about Guinea Pig films!
However, Dan Cruikshank has trivialized the history, culture social systems and architecture of these places to present an imperialist, pompous 'search for treasure' -(whatever that is supposed to mean).
I found it interesting to see that all the procedures and conventions had already evolved into much the same form that is still used today.
This is the kind of movie that is best watched with a couple of drinks and some good friends that you've gotten up to some fun with.
This is one of those films that the "artsy" crowd loves - a film that is just too "deep" for the average moviegoer to understand or appreciate.
If you want to watch a film that is worse, there are only a handful.
In one of them the occupants of one property refuse to be evacuated because they are living in a home that is built like Noah's Ark.
It's it jumped from another area to the area with no detail explanation on the drugs other than the ending which is probably my favorite part but still that is not enough.
--House of Death has the most funniest death scene that is the only "plus" side to this movie  ** IF you get pierced in the shoulder with an arrow, go and scream for help.
I know how important that is to you.
Each time I see a movie like this one,I think about the exterior conditions required for making a standout.When Pierre Grimblat made "Lisa",he did not lack,on an exterior plan,anything that Welles had when he made Touch of Evil ,or that Fellini had when he made Ginger e Fred ,or that Fuller,Kitano,and a few others had when they made their movies.It's not about budget,sets,etc.,external conditions,that is.
i admit, that is why i rented to movie; to see a movie about jim carrey having a funny face.
What then can be said about a film that is well known for being the first talkie (wellÂ that's not technically true, it's more a synchronized film) in film history?
Anyone who rated this thing higher than 1 star needs to go see their "dealer" immediately, and demand a refund, or at least something that isn't cut with strychnine.
Dark discovers that his parter has been possessed by a bloodthirsty evil entity that is responsible for the savage killings.
Like that terribly overrated skateboarding flick Dogtown And Z-Boys, this is a barrage of information that you didn't care to know, delivered by people sometimes visibly salivating at the prospect of recounting a story that isn't really worth telling.
I watched "Me and You and Everyone We Know" after this, and that is more along the lines of something I like to see in an indie film and films in general- an alternative point of view, some subversive humor and symbolism you're not beaten over the head with.
i am sorry, that is just inane.
By the end of the movie you do feel as though the kids life has emotionally effected you, you feel for the kid and his family, but that is about it.
All in all this movie is a poor attempt to teach us a lesson you either learn in first grade, or never learn, and that is that people are different and what is "popular is decided by the populous."
that is the point of a slaher film last time i checked.
I suspect its not all his fault though.I was never part of the I-hate-Anderson-crowd.But I think the fault here lies with him and the producers.He ruined AVP.Now this!I think he owes me 20 bucks now for paying to see the combined dreck that is AVP and RE2.In the same year no doubt!!!
Surprisingly, the director managed to craft a story that is significantly less interesting the one presented in the video game version.
The most blatant example is the character of L.J., played by actor Mike Epps, who embodies every "black" stereotype that is popular today.
Their is not one part in the whole film that is boring.
The act is horrible, but that is mainly due to stupid script and bad direction.
The possible exception is when the ball kills the care taker, but that is pretty mild by today's standards, so I wouldn't recommend it to little kids, or the faint of heart.
I can't begin to say all that is bad about this extremely long terribly boring mini-series.
Here is one of the worst things that is said & mind you these are supposed to be some of the smartest minds of all.
If that is all what it took to be shaking up, I'm surprised that the sisters survived this long.
If you've only seen an old, crappy video rental and dismissed this as "some lame 70s flick" then you have not experienced the glory that is  PHANTASM.
The problem with a film that is well shot is that one expects other production values to be good too.
The movie does share some beautiful scenery, which is ruined by dumb dialog riddled with clichÃ©, and a camera that is apparently attached to the back of a turtle, when not in the hands of a rampaging squirrel.
Okay - I realize this movie belongs to a genre that is, for the most part, immune to scrutiny.
This movie continues to be the only movie I have ever walked out on...I watched up to the point where his fly buddy that is up there when he gets killed sits down with the Russians to plan the attack to take place later in the film and then I couldn't take it anymore...I never saw what happens next, nor do I ever care to find out.....
All I can really say about this movie that is good... well, not that much.
Apart for 1 (that is ONE) scene (the pink petals that were falling as the hero was walking) this movie was plain horrible.
The premise is good, for B-Movie quality, that is, and was originally well executed in the film.
I don't care that they probably spent about a buck fifty (that isn't in thousands by the way) on actually making this movie.
The fact that the film does not featuring her is about as subtle as a pack of angry bulls running amok in a ceramics store that is being ravaged by a tornado.
So basically we're dealing with some unknowns whose fights scenes are silly, are acting badly, portraying a story that is totally ridiculous and filled with plot holes so big you can run Eddie Murphy's repertoire of yo-mama jokes through it.
Think that is a great story?
Stallone and Stone have no chemistry so basically we watch them discuss cat and mouse games that is hideously boring to watch.
Sorry, Sly but that isn't acting.
to characters who hadn't even said anything yet.The movie is, I have to admit, one of those that is so bad, it would qualify as one of those 'love to hate it' movies that you sit around with your friends with to watch and make fun of.
On the other hand, there is actually one TMNT movie that is worse than TMNT 3... and for those of you who want to know what it is, I will spare you the horror of ever thinking about it... okay, it's the Coming out of their shells tour video.
The thin plot has Hillary Brooke believing Costello has the map to a hidden territory that is rich with diamonds.
It's even worse when you consider the fact that is part of the Final Fantasy series of RPGs, which are noted for their excellence.
FF7's storyline even resembles that of FF6's, including an evil corporation that is trying to take over he world.
go rent Arsenic and Old Lace or Bringing up Baby or something that isn't Sullivan's Travels.
Possibly I don't know , but he directs CONFIDENCE in an entirely fast paced way , rather like " MTV Meets The Coen Brothers " which may give audience members a potential headache  Despite the directing which comes across as garish and shallow we're left with a movie that is let down by the script and one can't help thinking the screenplay is what caused the director to look for Scorsese's CASINO for inspiration .
In a nutshell, this is the kind of show, that is totally harmless to people.
The thing is, among all of the randomness that is "Phantasm", this is quite a terrifying movie.
The ending is so ludicrous, such an insult to anyone's intelligence, that is has to offend anyone, regardless of their political persuasion.
Any film that is cheap and Australian is bad.
Okay maybe that is not completely accurate but one might certainly think along those lines as a doctor found guilty of a mercy killing is sentenced to hang despite his promising youth serum.
Actually that is not completely accurate as well.
It began in 1992, so the regular actors have now aged 15 years in a series that is supposed to span 10.
I can't tell you why anything transpires the way it does in here, I can't even tell you why people do the things they do, but I don't really think that is the point of the film.
Perhaps this is a film that is esoteric by design and if that is the case then perhaps I should just watch it over and over again until I do have some sort of puerile grasp of it.
And if you watch this film from beginning to end you will see why this makes all the sense in the world, yet it is still an abstruse concept that is meant to be exactly what it is.
But that is where the title "typical horror film" ends and it crosses over into Rod Serling territory.
I liked the cast of characters, but they definitely made the town look like a small hick town that is not current, and it is nothing like that.
It is behind us, and that is where we would like to keep it.
Oh, yes, that is a movie that features SFX that are OK in Dr Who or The outer Limits, but these are TV shows, right?
If that is actually new to you, I recommend the book "The Shock Doctrine" by Naomi Klein and not a crappy science fiction movie.
Overall, the movie itself isn't bad and you can see it without regrets it's still a nice movie but it's nothing more and that is probably the most disappointing thing about it : you don't feel more than looking at an OK film.
What you essentially get is some effectively gross-looking characters with dialog that is so boring you want to blow their ship up every 5 minutes.
The bad acting, lame script and storyline, and hilarious images of zombies retching around with water spewing out of their mouths may have come together to form a movie that is actually worth watching for comedy fans.
It's a very simple typical kind of movie score, that is too prominently present at times when nothing is happening in the movie and not present at all- or not good enough at the tense or scary moments of the movie.
Let's say that we didn't notice the make-up that is supposed to make the actors look like zombies but instead makes them look like they dropped buckets of various paint over their heads, or when water came out the "zombies'" mouths like when you put water in your mouth and talk - you know, like when you were in kindergarten.
And the mentioned stuff was for a big part filmed from far away, and how scary is stuff that is filmed from far away?
I didn't watch the whole thing but I saw enough to know that this movie makes most low budget films look like masterpieces, OK maybe that is a bit too harsh.
But that isn't the worst part.
"Thomas and the Magic Railroad" is a feel-good, happy-go-lucky children's film that is based on the long-loved "Thomas the Tank Engine and Friends" (now simply "Thomas and Friends") series of shorts.
Further more: all the so called "evidence" can easily be read in another fashion Â that is: his entire conclusion can very easily have been misread, because it is based on very few and very easily disputed evidence.
All in all The Visitor is a passable time killer, that is incoherent, yet very fun to watch.
The only thing that I wanted to see more of was more of the engines, but there are like 70 of them, so I guess that is impossible.
i mean if people want to see a 'gangster' film they would see scarface or pulp fiction not this garbage and i cant believe that the person from liverpool above me called it 'fantastic' it is very far from it but maybe one would say it is not a high budget film but that is no excuse for it being so awful is it?
Even more discouraging is the subtle message that is presented by Stiles-that to be accepted you must conform to those around you, even if that means going against your personal feelings or beliefs.
She did a good job dancing, that is about it.
"Messages" is the type of promising B-movie that is wasted due to a flawed, inconsistent and incoherent story, badly developed screenplay and terrible direction.
There has to be one that is better than The Sickhouse, Session 9, the remake of House on Haunted Hill, the Attic Expeditions, etc.
There is a romantic moment at the very end of the film that is spectacularly out of place and dissolves immediately any character development that might have come before, and like much of the rest of the movie, it ends with a small child whispering some utter nonsense to us.
I'm desperately trying to think of something positive to say about this film and all I can come up with the cinematography and general look of the film was quite interesting, well that is at the few points in the film where it was possible to actually make out what was happening.
Unlike the first two films, the stuff that is supposed to be funny simply isn't, and most of the stuff that is supposed to be dramatic is spoiled by bad timing or misjudged performances that ruin any sense of involvement in the film.
Richard Lester proved once and for all that he really didn't understand what a Superman movie should be, seemingly relying on British slapstick comedy that is taken right out of an episode of Monty Python's Flying Circus "where it belongs!"
Thomas & the Magic Railroad is a full-length film that is a complete disgrace to Thomas.
A note to aspiring filmmakers everywhere: if you're going to make a film, take your time and come up with a story that is interesting and that you can confidently tell.
It's a special talent to be able to make a bad movie that is fun to watch, and the makers of A*P*E* definitely have that talent.
Aside from these stupid subplots, the rest of the film is essentially KING KONG but set in a Korea that is chock-full of crappy sets.
I have a feeling that the director and script writer wanted to make the worst film of all time.If that is the case they did it.
Now a 36 foot ape that is in Korea.
The dialogue could be chopped from a who's who of cliche riddled movies and assemblyed into unstoppable force of all that is predictable.
When i read the book, i found out that is was all but faithful to Vladimir Nabokov's book.
Some of the fights in this movie still are pretty cool, but there are just something that isn't there.
Another really good movie that is similar but not really about skinheads is the 1984 movie called suburbia.I read it was coming to DVD finally and I am looking forward to seeing it again.It reminded me of pariah, but an 80's version.
I was in pain after watching the seemingly never ending mess that is Pariah.
In pain from laughing so hard at the nonsense I witnessed, that is.
If you like acting, see another Meryl Streep or Stanley Tucci film, preferably one that is well enough written to let the actors do their jobs.
Worth looking at to see Anna Paquin in yet another role that is truly beneath her.
that is so nice and cuddly that people cant stand it ?
It is hard to rate a movie that is so bad, but still can be very amusing.
There is nothing in the movie that is good, including the famous worm rape scene, which is the only tentacle rape scene in US movies that I've seen, but which was so clumsily made that it stirred nothing.
But instead it's supposed to be a sequel to film that is no masterpiece, but is damn sure far more interesting and entertaining than this.
William Hurt, Robert Duvall, Raul Julia, Sandrine Bonnaire and Jean-Marc Barr star in a film dealing with a plague that is infecting a South American city.
He finally gets the opportunity to execute his wife's killer, only to inexplicably back down and instead allow a Maori soldier working for the "pakeha" (non-Maori, mostly for white man) to do the deed, apparently mesmerized by Maori chanting and suddenly becoming sympathetic to a culture and cause that is not his own.
But that is actually the highlight of the movie, nothing else interesting happens.
Oh, undeniably, but that is not the point.
With a shitty ending that is even more horrible.
I gave this movie one star, because that is just what it deserves.
Well that is it for my comment.
(Who could love a studio that is run by a sweaty Tor Johnson lookalike?)
It is framed with some more current (from the early 90's anyway) footage that is boring, poorly acted and cheaply shot.
Now, if you're that is not to say I hated this, but rather I expected lots more here.
That would be if Mystery Science Theater 3000 were to take on this movie as a project and were to work their magic and at least make this over-the-top, cheesy B-grade movie into something that is laughable for reasons other than the predictable dialog and ridiculously melodramatic acting.
Supersonic (for that is his name) is sleeping in a spaceship when an intergalactic voice tells him an evil mastermind wants to kidnap a professor so he, the evil mastermind, can rule over the world.
I would have excluded the weird 35-year-old-looking daughter that is supposed to be a fragile little girl.
Ignore the non-existent plot and acting and just roll along on the river of cheese in a film that is so bad it is hilarious.
The funny thing about that is, that history proved that wrong, Arnold actually turned out to be an extraordinary actor with a successful career.
This may on one hand actually well be the worst movie I've seen, on regular movie basis that is, because on the other hand it's also the funniest movie I've stumbled across since I saw "Monty Python and the quest for the holy grail".
For him, that is.
Finally was it also a strange "romance" that is hard to call romantic or funny, but at least didn't fail completely!
I doubt if that is what really goes on - it was all flash and little chops.
In fact, you could do better watching a 20 minute short on skiers in the Rockies, and save the other hour plus that is wasted watching "Subject Two".
But...something that is worth a watch is also worth a telling, right?
Genevieve Bujold as the disconnected mother is the best thing in it, but these days, that isn't saying much, because so many people are disconnected.
If this is what passes for children's entertainment in China, then that is one messed up country.
Oh my god, they've seen nothing; nothing to compare to the hilarious nonsense that is Hawk the Slayer.
Shot almost entirely on a single Abbey set in Pinewood and the woods surrounding the studios in the heart of Autumn, this demented no-budget British spaghetti sword-opera Â a sort of would-be A Fistful of Swords Â pits John Terry's virtuous hero against his evil one-eyed brother with a taste for Darth Vaderesque headgear Jack Palance after the latter kills their badly dubbed dad Ferdy Mayne in a squabble over "The power that is rightly mmmmiiiiiiinnnnnnneee!"
That sounds like the opening scene of a softcore porn film, and at first it seems that that is exactly what "Donkey Punch" is turning into.
But as soon as the titular incident occurs (and the titular incident really does occur; just in case anyone else suspected that the title was merely a jocular come-on) the plot suddenly helter skelters straight into a brick wall; turning into the kind of dated, tiresome trash that isn't only shockingly predictable, but also entirely unaware of its own predictability.
The film's twists are broadly apparent a full ten minutes before they occur on screen, which makes for an experience that isn't only boring, but also deeply and repeatedly annoying.
Enough said, besides that issue this movie did not do much for me, depressing and lacked a point for me.
cant believe i'm even taking time to write how excruciatingly awful unfunny boring clichÃ©d this unspeakable thing was, the movie studio allowing him to make it must have been because they wanted to see him  as the assistant manager at a taco bell not writing producing movies - that is the only possible explanation  with something this bad one must not have many friends to clue you in before it too late 'hey this is bad bad bad' 7th graders on you tube have better writing skills.
There are actually few real boxing scenes in the film, except for the end, and that is why labeling this as a 'boxing movie' seems a bit deceptive.
I mean there is nothing that is great about it, but it isn't offensively bad like many of the other commercialized, mass-audience films like these are (i.e.
Unlike A Few Good Men, still the best of its kind, Rules of Engagement falls flat because even as none of the character actions make sense, nothing is surprising either, and that is the biggest sin of all.
Max Von Sydow as Captain Schroeder gives the best performance in the movie  All the cast do their best but it's really the script that is at fault .
I haven't bothered to read all of the other comments but I'm sure it must have been stated before -- this is a completely mediocre comedy that is simply yet another attempt by Hollywood to ride on the coattails of much better films like "Rushmore" and "Napoleon Dynamite."
Why they chose such a horrible actor for the lead is beyond me but as usual, I chalk that up to the mafia that is Hollywood where friends cast friends or cast their cousin's kid or the producer casts their own kid etc.
One dimensional character that is supposed to gain our sympathy and yet she failed to engage the audience to sympathize with her.
The film was started post HAHK(even the title was HUM AAPKE HAI SANAM that time) and it took 8 years to complete  When the promo was shown i was shocked considering SRK and Salman haven't shared screenspace since KARAN ARJUN and suddenly a film with them and Madz comes   The movie is regressive, outdated and could be better in 90's  The back story of Madz- Salman is so cringeworthy even there is too much sermonising  But there is one plus point and that is SRK in this film, well normally he overdoes his scenes here he is in full control and plays his role with a straight face and brings a lot of fun in the movie  Sadly the film never manages to sustain the tempo and we have tripe like GALE MEIN LAAL TIE.etc  Also it's funny to see the appearances of actors Salman suddenly in 1 scene looks straight out of JUDWAA days with his medium sized hair and with his overacting but lively acting and then he comes to 2001 days where he looks dead The dubbing too is inconsistent and also his acting which goes from amateurish and then to dead acting SRK too suddenly has short hair, long hair and also his looks keep changing and so his dubbing and acting Madz too, in 1 scene she has brown hair and then the ponytailed black hair look  The film also has the late Laxmikant Berde who wasn't much seen in 2002 Also we see Atul Agnihotri who was rejected post 1998 i feel and was just seen as an extra   Direction by KS Abdiyamaan is outdated though good in parts Music is okay, most songs sound old Cinematography is inconsistent  Acting SRK though looks inconsistent yet he delivers a wonderful performance and rarely hams which is a relief Madz is as usual, she does a good job but her role is too regressive Salman khan is inconsistent, at times lively and at times dead below average overall Laxmikant Berde is okay Alok Nath is okay in a small role Atul Agnihotri is a reject and he annoys
The research that is being done concerns a kind of nerve gas that will turn all Americans into blathering idiots (it's probably too late for that anyway).
It used to come on television all the time, but you rarely see it these days and seeing how low its score is here, that is probably a good thing.
I can usually find some redeeming value in any movie, no matter how bad, but that is not the case with "Knight Chills."
I use the term "edge" on purpose, of course, for in The Muse, that is what his character, Steven Phillips, is bemoaning his loss of: What all of Hollywood refers to as his "edge."
Gee, do I care that a Hollywood screenwriter is having writer's block and can't crank out the same drivel and trash that is making America even dumber so he can support his completely vapid, boring and lazy trophy wife (nothing against Andie McDowell just talking about the story line kids)?
But that is about it.
But what we actually get is the real sort of movie that the conservative critics have accused all summer-style movies of being: brainless formulaic uncreative popcorn entertainment plying to the lowest common denominator that is churned out when the bloated Hollywood studio system is working on autopilot.
And that is supposed to be the best in the entire movie?
If, that is, you have a sense of humor.
In fact, hardly a scene goes by that is not unintentionally funny.
Bottom line: it's a movie that is worth watching just in case you're curious to see more about Argentinian movies.
The packaging claims that the film was 'Shot on location on six continents' and I guess that is technically correct- of course the stock footage was shot by _someone else_-- seems a little misleading for a film destined for the Christian market.
Predictably, then, this movie takes huge liberties with historical fact and Phillipa Gregory's historical fiction, and that is not a good thing.
I would say that Natalie Portman's good performance makes the film slightly worth sitting through, but the positive aspect in that is completely cancelled out by the atrocity that is whatever Scarlett Johansson did.
It treats the subject with dignity, gravity and a cast that is fully committed to the material (not to mention it is still scary as all hell, too).
The matter of Axel's struggle with fear becomes subordinate to his offspring's emotional entanglements, although there are many slow motion closeups of the brute to enliven the action in a film that is bedevilled with serious flaws of continuity.
Dr. Loomis plays a novelist and great white hunter drawn to equatorial Southeast Asia who takes up the challenge to track down a rogue panther that is mauling local villagers on some sort of island/peninsula/water bound isolated location.
It's not often that you see a film that is pure, unmitigated crap.
Note to producers: If you're going to spoof a genre that is no longer in vogue, at least make it funny.
I guess it takes a while into the movie to finally get the idea that is what is going on.
Jill Clayburgh is wonderful as Grace, the spurned, icy divorcÃ©e that is ready to open up and love again.
During the main fight scene, all that is shown is peoples' feet falling off.
It portrays people and a romance that is real.
But a film full of quotations and references is a trick that is worth doing once or twice.
I just got back from the noon showing of Kill Bill in which the theater was half full (for a noon showing, that is huge.
There is no snappy dialogue and that is what QT is good at.
He travels to a remote hydroponic station on one of Saturn's moons, Triton, where he builds a robot that is connected to his brain by radio.
Keitel then builds a robot that is able to relate his thoughts.
The shoddy acting is enhanced, that is to say made shoddier, by a script so threadbare, they let Fawcett wear it in one of the bedroom scenes (shudder).
He looks like skeletor, and Farah Fawcett, literally 30 years younger than him, plays a doe eyed dumb blonde that is incapable of being anything but helpless.
The dog getting killed, Harvey Kietel's hand being chopped off are part of the fun gore that is in this movie, and the robot is clearly the most convincing actor of the movie, at about 45 minutes in you'll realize there just isn't too much to this movie - after Kietel's character is killed off, that just leaves the two creepy ugly idiots in love (fawcett and douglas) to run from the robot for the rest of the movie.
Not only is the script, acting (for the most part), and the directing superb-- it has a plot that is not seen in ever other love film known to man!
However, if that is all that can be wrong with a film, then it is near perfection in my book.
The ground attack sequences should use the term "Fire for effect" as that is what they clearly are, poor fireworks!!!
I may not be able to review this film as eloquently as others do but that is down to my sheer frustration at a chance wasted here.
The Zombie Diaries is a rubbishy low budget zombie film that tries to copy the style of The Blair Witch Project but just comes across as a total mess that is pretty hard to watch.
But I doubt that is the case.
So I shouldn't be too surprised in the disappointing and wasted effort that is THE ZOMBIE DIARIES.
This film covers a period in the Bible that is difficult to dramatise.
If, that is, he chooses the fake fighting over the real thing.
That is not obvious here, rather, Steven Soderberg's film goes the longest way possible to get a conclusion that is obvious, if indeed the film has a conclusion in the first place.
If I were to single out one aspect that is particularly like fingernails on the blackboard, it is Catherine Keener as Lee.
Steven Soderbergh is a brilliant director and he's one that is experimental by heart but when your already established in the industry these experimental films can be pretty risky.
I have seen him in several movies and, in all of the others, he portrays, basically, the same type of character, that is, a slightly officious mid level executive, a spurned suitor, etc.
it had all the ingredients, but is ultimately ruined by two thousand times overused clichÃ©s which seem to have become fashionable again nowadays (see, for instance 'Brokeback Mountain' or the French 'Le clan'):the first one: the old homosexual teacher, OF COURSE, had to die at the end (the fact that is is a motorcycle accident and not a bashing doesn't matter, finally...); the fact that everyone mourns him at the end does not matter, the moral is safe, he finally 'paid for his sins'.
He graduates eventually to actually killing, and that is what gets him caught.
Like I said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow as Werner Pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.
This movie is an unbelievable drag... first of all it has a very trashy look that is obvious from the opening of the movie.
Yes, that is one hell of a cast but that doesn't really save this film anyway.
On DVD it is worth a look , if you can watch it for free that is.
This movie is the only one that is true to the real story that I've seen.
But worse than that is the fact that the movie has no sense of irony, no joie de vivre and no fun.
Now, I will be the first to say that she has wonderful muscular body which I am sure took years of passion and hard work to achieve, but that is not enough criteria for her to be placed into a film wearing a white ala Marilyn Monroe dress and made to walk around the ghettos of Bulgaria.
I'm proud to said this and i don't want people to think that is from a hole other country.
The cinema MUST surely have taught us all enough about the lives and work of conmen by now for us to find it ludicrously improbable that either of the two main characters would be willing to expose thousands of dollars of money already "in hand" in order to secure the alleged "sure thing" of a deal that is to net them many thousands more (after all, it is the endemic idiocy of such greed and of the general greed-driven tendency to forget the "bird in the bush" principle that is the very basis of a conman's livelihood).
It just makes me sad that when there are people struggling to get new interesting movies funded, that it is seen as more profitable to do a remake of a film that is only a few years old anyway.
Tangled may not be an excellent film, either, but he drops his pants for you in it, and that is worth something you won't get out of "The Maker."
Will (Robert Knott) enters a shop and doesn't have enough for his beer, so he takes it out of a jar on the counter that is there to pay for his daughter Emma's (Tara Devon Gallagher) ear operation.
Now, i tell you... that is sick.
An ongoing story-line has Breckel dealing with the animosity of members of his staff who are finding it hard to deal with the violence that is transpiring.
It's only natural then that the viewer might become frustrated by his idealistic persistance, a feeling that is shared (ironically) by his antagonists inside the movie (the abusive supervisor and the army officials).
So, in summary, if you've never read the book, you're in for a nice surprise: comedy that is still funny after a hundred years and more, but don't let this film put you off.
But even sadder, here's a version ('86) that is far better, and few people know it exists.
I can forgive not knowing what happens to the hero at the end of the movie and the minutia that is only kind of a cute sub plot.
(80%) Perhaps that is why the movie never made a box office impact in India, because it was too busy pleasing its Jewish sponsors.
This film is crowded with poetic and metaphysical "knowledge" that is just picked up from encyclopedias, mixed with pure nonsensical "interpretations" and randomly spread in the legion of massively overlong monologues.
or i guess they were just making fun of themselves and others..  watching the title of the movie i thought that it would be some good ship movie but after watching the movie i was really disappointed..the acting was terrible..the main villain in the movie was so dumb and was thinking as he was the God..means he was so over acting at several points...  i could not understand what they were up to before and during making this movie..there is no story the action scenes are lame and cheap.. they could have done better in many ways like acting and other points..but they have to fail to do so and make a piece of crap...  never ever watch this movie under any circumstances... i wished i could give this movie 0 but that is not possible as the lowest vote is 1
I remember seeing this film when it first came out, and also remember that is disappeared from the video store shortly thereafter.
Hold on, he is no longer shot; there is no wound, that is strange.
Ahhh, but the guard guy wasn't so easily fooled, nope, uh-uh, he realised that is was quite suspicious for one to forget their mother's phone number.
Speaking of Mulholland Drive, I noticed Mr Fink flaunts a hairstyle that is most definitely copied from somewhereÂa famous David Lynch film; I won't spell it out to you.
I had heard that Hell Night was an overlooked slasher flick - that is true, but it is nothing special or original.
Greek pledges find themselves in an abandoned mansion that is rumored to still be occupied by the deformed offspring of the owner.
I`m sorry but I was convinced that British army infantry regiments of the period were composed of " Pals battalions " , that is battalions composed entirely of men from the same home town .
No one can deny that Ann Harding was something to look at, and that is about all this film has to offer.
However, that is not to say that films cannot convincingly portray great athletes on screen.
And yes, that is what the book was about.
The butcher house sequence, however, is a pretty nasty as an idea and has some interest in it, too, and that is also easily among the film's "most interesting" parts.
Save yourself from the utter brain cell annihilation that is this movie.
Because that is the ONLY conceivable reason than this series focused so entirely on her character instead of Blade who had absolutely no airtime by comparison.
Unfortunately, these bits of promise were interrupted by inept camera-work that is usually invoked when the movie-maker is too lazy to painstakingly map out fight scenes or brainstorm over fresh combinations of moves and maneuvers.
Basically, what we have here is another simple revenge tale, and not one that is well done.
Well anyway Hunter (Michael Beck), our hero gets involved in the plot because of a girl, that is no less then Straker's daughter.
I like the start thou, it has this burning tire smoky start that is so a direct rip off of Ole' Max which is hard not to laugh.
Secondly, I gave it a "2" because, no matter how unlikely it seems, there is probably at least one movie that is worse, and I'll need to have the "1" available for that.
There is one good side to this movie however and that is it can be used in video classes at universities to show an example of what not to do when making a movie of any kind, for example, don't even make a movie that is so boring people can tell by looking at the actors faces.2 : spend the extra money and get a wardrobe so the actors can change clothes 3: don't use archive footage and if you absolutely must use archive footage don't get footage that doesn't make sense, like a single car exploding next to a body of water doesn't make sense when matched with an explosion or accident of two cars in a land locked area.
Add to that various extremely stupid character behaviours topped off with our hero falling for a trap that is so obvious, that only a senile mental facility patient could fall for...  Other weaknesses - I didn't really feel any build-up and the online killing theme seems underused for dramatic purposes (millions of people watching and we get no feedback as to how the general public is reacting to it).
"s, and "that is not possible!
But as well all know, or at least all of us who use the internet for many reasons including and what I consider to be the most important of all and that is to seek out the truth when it comes to news the internet is in fact the last bastion of free speech, well in Europe it most definitely is.
Computers bleep and boop every time a key is touched, intensely suspenseful over-the-top music at almost EVERY single point of the movie (no matter how un-suspenseful the moment actually is) and the creators try to get across a message that people are inherently evil for wanting to watch torture when that is exactly what the audience is sitting there watching!
The way the screenplay reads, it is a cowboy picture and that is how I am going to play Genghis Khan.
Enjoy some spectacular horse-riding and stunt work, and the Utah Valley scenery ,for that is about all their is to enjoy.
This is the one film John Wayne made that is truly terrible.
Highlander: The Source takes place in the near future, in Eastern Europe that is going to hell with crime, gangs and riots.
The first thing that comes to mind watching this movie is that is must have been a fan-flic.
But once that is past, then one is left with direction that seems to come out of a school that is based entirely on a time when MTV still made music videos, with touches of would-be 300 knock-off thrown in either as unintentional or as sucker-punching for genre fans.
And acting that is just fair at best and atrocious at worst (Adrian Paul can act, says who?
The actors from the series are all there, the ones whose characters survived the series anyway, and that is the only plus I can possibly give this movie.
I feel betrayed by the film makers who took a mythology that is precious to me and distorted it so much as to render it unrecognizable.
...star that is.
There really is nothing good about this film including the main plot point of the source that is any good.
It's even worse than "Endgame" and that is really an achievement.
"Sticks and Stones: Investigating the Blair Witch" seems/seemed to just be another way to cash in on the The Blair Witch Phenomenon, a phenomenon that is being totally milked dry.
The black and white photography is astonishing; there is a particular scene of the young couple running through the forest at high speed that is extremely beautiful; at times, the scenes are so realistic one wonders how they did this (did they actually put the actors next to a real forest fire?)
Other than that, don't look for a decent script (for a b-movie that is, not an actual movie, of course) nor decent acting nor decent humour nor decent anything.
Is it because Earth is under peril from natural and man-made disasters that is described in the prophecies of Nostradamus?
The movie has only one purpose and that is to gain sympathy for illegal immigrants.
David Cronenberg's Camera is a great short.There's is only 2 people in the film witch's makes it more interesting to watch.The film is pretty rare so I hope that anybody that is a fan of Cronenberg will try to find.this .I was lucky enought to find a copy on the internet.On a scale of 1 to 10 Camera gets a 9, Highly recamended to a Cronenberg fan.
But, I think the official term for that is "contributing to the delinquency of a minor."
It's a nifty little piece that is a good accessory to see as a Cronenberg fan- the big pyshcological dramatic points are lessened for the sake of an intro to a film festival.
Pedestrian direction and a screenplay that offends at every turn provide further twists of the knife in this childish and predictable comedy that is an embarrassment to all involved.
Plus the idea that the Old Man is dying, but is being immortalized by the same camera that is killing him.
True, but that is also the plot of this mediocre Lina Wertmuller film, Summer Night with Greek Profile, etc., as well as the plot of that other mediocre Lina Wertmuller film, the remake of Swept Away.
A sorceress that isn't a sorceress anymore in a Swords & Sorcery flick.
Let me summarise the story:  A "holy" warrior, Kain (David Carradine) comes across this little village that is dominated by two tyrants.
The one thing that is of good quality and done well are the explosions.
You may be able to get a refund on your money, but that is 95 minutes of your life you will never see again.
Now that is laugh out loud funny!
Europe the country, that is.
This is a movie that is about being vulgar, hateful, and worthless.
As in unbelievably bad, that is.
The music is absolutely superb but it doesn't fit in with the things happening on the screen, but there is one good thing and that is some of the actors who act really good.
After capturing the nutty lady, they chase Divine and Pearce and take them to a "hospital" that is really just some house.
And that is exactly how they are depicted!
The only good thing about the movie is Bob Hoskins - and if that isn't a sentence to scare the living daylights out of you then you deserve this movie!
Also, seeing the Twin Towers...well, that is another subject (possibly the most powerful part of the film for today).
Oh, and by the way, there is no such thing as the Chinese Mandarin stamp that is worth a fortune--this was made up for the film.
Fuji at the end isn't that bad, and is a long, drawn-out one that is quite nice and very well-done.
The fact that there's split-screen scenes and hand-drawn animation used for other scenes makes it quite childish and distracts from the more adult-level tone that is being presented.
He goes through a metamorphosis in his life starting off as little tadpole like creatures, turns into a lizard like form with four legs, then becomes a flying saucer like form, and finally an upright walking form that is taller than Godzilla.
Bird joins service, bird save the day, and that is about it.
This was nothing to write home about, and even worse little kids won't care about anything that is happening.
There are some really cheesy chase scenes, horrible music, nausea-inducing acting, a story that is either too confusing or too boring to follow (I can't remember, I fell asleep!
Although some have told me they would like to see a 15th anniversary re-release that is remastered in THX certified digital surround sound.
See this film, and judge for yourself, although I think you'll agree, that digitizing can't make a film that is already of this quality any better.
This movie represents something that is actually quite rare.
A movie that is so horribly Directed and Written with a cast that has no acting ability what so ever.
You need a movie with a plot that is so ridiculous and plot less like to do this.
Nobody who saw the film, that is.
"The Final Sacrifice") a kid conveniently stumbles upon a map of some sort that is a key to a "lost city."
The small town setting is wonderful and the economic plight of the oysterman is painful to watch...the disappearing way of life that is so common in many rural areas.
As an MST, this film is in my top 5 (I am a huge MST fan), but it is one of the few that is easy to watch even without our be-silhouetted trio.
Troy is looking for who caused the death of his father, he finds a map that is supposed to lead him to a lost world.
While spineless Vince wrestles with his conscience, his downtrodden father, Harold, reveals a hitherto undeclared talent for magic that is nearer to the X-Files than the spoon-bending antics of Uri Geller.
Vera-Ellen does a tap dance number with the Goldwyn Girls that is AMAZING to watch.
But that isn't the half of it; we are exposed to such treats as Sands sticking rats down his trousers (yes, you read that right) and does it not worry anyone else about the amount of nudity Pop requires of Asia?
The plot of this film is fairly simple: Johnny Click (that is his name) is a photographer played by Peter Agostino.
Bela Lugosi plays a ruthless Chinese villain that is not short in ordering murder in order to collect the fabled 'twelve coins of Confucius' for himself.
Go and see it,you won't be disappointed,unless you are mainstream,that is!  
You could do worse ("Wrong Turn" may still be playing at a theatre near you), but this is just the sort of formulaic Hollywood psuedo-family comedy that is so tried and true it should work, but falls short in every laughless scene.
Daddy Day Care is a nice family film that is entertaining to watch.
Lauren Graham plays Scallion's girlfriend that is caught up in the fame game.
The only thing that I really enjoyed of that film was the erotic electricity between two older characters that is a rare thing to see in a movie.
Teaching children to kill any creature that is doing no harm is, to me, immoral.
This film manifests all that is degenerate about the "coming of age" genre: saccharine sentimentality, numbing clichÃ©, jarringly unsubtle plot devices.
The best scene though, in any film PERIOD and the scene that is worth renting the film for is where Patty and her retarded gal pals are in that awesome mustang headed back to grandmas house in the country and her friend is reading a letter from her husband who is a soldier.
But in this crummy film, that isn't saying much.
If this heap of misery entitled 'Dynasty' has made so many people happy then that is fine by me.
The main problem is that is was difficult for me to like either character.
Horrible and very funny adaptation of the popular children's book that plays like a bad SNL skit that is trying to parody "The Lord of the Rings" than the book that it's based on.
For a film that is sung throughout, this is no mean feat, and the predictability of Robert Kelly's vocals cements the plot's position as main attraction.
For example we got a "bad guy", that isn't really evil... more conflicted or confused cause he wants to get famous.
Roughly Speaking is a film that is full of tragic events, but none seem pointless or even tragic.
The rest of the excruciating running time is devoted to O'Bannon & Ted's investigations as they uncover the conspiracy, unfortunately They Crawl is one of those films where we, the audience that is, know that there are killer cockroaches scuttling around & it takes the main character's virtually the entire film to catch up & it becomes an absolute snooze fest waiting.
And that is systematic for the movie.
This happens until the finals where the Chicken Little is responsible for the team to win and is respected and the people of the town forget about his past life, that is, the trouble he had caused by alarming everyone about the sky falling.
I generally like movies that depict anything that is "non mainstream".
"Cannibal Terror") I was expecting to see a film of the kind that is so awful that it is actually kind of funny.
Awful it is indeed, but in a manner that is nothing but... awful!
A jungle that is very obviously situated in France, that is, however.
Bedrock looks OK you can easily see that they've spent a lot of time working on it trying to make it look just like the cartoon but the story compared to the one the cartoon has is a definite insult just look at the ratings that this movie has here at IMDB 4.4 right now (March 7th 2000) those guys at Universal should have back in 1993 (when they were writing the script) well the story is really bad let's make a movie combining 4 of the most popular episodes in one story that would have been a very good idea I'm sure that it would have had made much more money than the 358.5 million it made worldwide even though that is a lot I know that if they had a better story it would have like 500M or more.
I expect something better with the prequel that is coming out this summer even though I don't think the people they chose to be the new Flintstones look like them as the first cast did.
In my opion, that is at least 4 stars too many.
but unfortunately anyone else would find this to be what is it, a really quite boring and stupid horror wanna-be that is full of really bad writing and stupid coincidences.
THE VALET, however, played as yet another string in the long ball of yarn that is the rapidly dwindling comedy genre.
That alone isn't necessarily a problem, but when you've got a really ordinary, simple storyline you've really got to work to make it interesting -- and alas writer/director Francis Veber doesn't do anything with the material that isn't highly predictable and dull.
And that is pretty much all that is discernible from a plot that bounces around more than the heroine when she battles bad guys...and girls.
The movie's downfall is its attempt to cram too much of everything into a world and story that is a lot more simple.
The sweet tunes of a grand piano gently transport us into an ordinary world that is soon going to come crashing down.
You would think the action would at least make it worth the time but even that is nothing to brag about.
So, the film opens with a a lengthy, completely unnecessary monologue by Chun-Li that is supposed to set the story and give neophytes into the Street Fighter saga some background into her life.
At least that is the strong impression I got from the episode I just saw.
Other than the aforementioned actors comic relief turns in this flick, the delightful eye-candy that is the luscious Anna Friel and an uneven soundtrack with a small handful of classic 70's rock ditties that still make me want to hold up a lighter even to this day I just can't bring myself to say that "Sunset Strip" is much of a movie, and certainly not one that comes highly recommended to anyone!
If that is the case, then I believe Muzaffar Ali is a fantastic story-writer and screenplay-writer.
Somehow in line with "Calendar Girls" and "Mrs Henderson Presents" as it deals with the sex life of elderly ladies, "Irina Palm" is the story of the slightly-more-than-middle-aged Maggie who has to raise a large sum of money in order to save her grandchild from dying, takes a job as a w*nker in a sex club (minimal physical touch, no nude scenes, all done in the best taste) (... imaginable under the circumstances, that is) - and finds that she has a rare talent for just that sort of work.
After making a sexy robot in his sister's image, he sets out to kill each of the rapists in a manner that is brutal and graphic and, thanks to Robot-Gaily's recording ability, shown several times.
Finding her niche in hand jobs (to be polite) she sets about becoming the best in London and the target of headhunters (or hand-hunters in this case) What I really enjoyed is the sheer brilliant humanity that Ms Faithful brought to the screen as she realizes that there are real people who work the industry, real that is with families, and homes of their own Special mention must go to Miki Manojlovic and Jenny Agutter for two of the best scenes in the film.
I gotta give them credit for the operations scenes but that's all that is good with this show.
If you wanna see dumb entertainment that is popular today, pathetic excuse for a characters and story, Christian Troy's ass in every episode and some gross but rather impressive surgical scenes than this show is great for you.
Well this is French cinema, that is the kind most film critics leniently praise precisely for wandering.
Forced by necessity and desperation Maggie does something that is at first utterly alien to her, but may yet become an awakening and salvation, a route to an identity she does not know she has and to new love.
And that is the only reason to pick that movie: Monique Gabrielle.
If you want to know how the serie Z movies are, that is your movie.
This movie has other flaws which have been pointed out by numerous other reviewers, but this is one that is a lot more subtle that I hope will be corrected in other films in the future.
1 star out of 5 and that is only because of RenÃ©e Zellweger.
The movie is good, that is all I can say.
Alain Resnais adaption of Marguerite Duras' Hiroshima Mon Amour is an exception that is beautiful.
The cinematography was stunning though, that is in part why I chose to watch this movie.
Even if that is your thing, I recommend that you skip this movie for better adventures elsewhere.
So if you are interested in seeing this do so without expecting to get any inside information about the life of these people or if you are interested in seeing behind the scenes backstabbing there is the soap opera scene (it is unintentionally hilarious but the one thing that is actually close to the truth).
How can a show that is so desperately trying to be different be so full of clichÃ© and formula?
and the conversations about killing animals and wanting to kill people Dexter the kid has with his father, HOW RIDICULOUS  It's not just the Monologue that is contrived, so are the sets.
I wonder why they didn't bring up this difference when considering which of the devices they should attack, but I suppose that is asking for too much from a movie like this.
Freeze, Batgirl Â and manages to combine them into a movie that isn't a painfully misconceived travesty.
Brad wont let her in and basically that is where the plot revolves.
Whether SubZero is the best Batman movie that is up for debate, but it is a long, long way from being the worst.
True, the secondary characters could've done with more development, but it is compensated by top notch animation, a good music score, surprisingly mature scripting and a compelling enough story, that is quite action packed, and the ending was very poignant to say the least.
In the meantime, a specialist group of army technicians and possibly doctors (it's not clear) come to the house, question the sole occupant and take away a sample, for analysis, of the dust that is still just sitting there under the blanket.
It's a hour and a half abusing on jokes about the language (mis-spelling Portuguese) together with a story that is "by all means" absurd and that's all.
That is not talent, that is consistency.
The gig is up, and that is THE WORD on Colbert.
I for one have never really been a big fan of animated cartoon type movies, that is since I'm now an adult but in my past as a kid I treasured them.
You know they are inhabited because they all of a sudden speak in a stupid computerized "scary" voice that isn't scary.
I just know that they have one where you insert the names and they crank out canned dialog that is appropriate to movies like this.
This film is awful, make no mistake - but had it not set people up to see a remake of a classic it may have passed at least as a mildly entertaining failure as opposed to a total waste of time that is offensive to it's own genre.
Nice special effects that is literally all I can think of and they are no where near as good as Tom Savini's.
The zombies were doing things that is not even possible by humans(such as crawling along a ceiling).
The so called special effects were on par with movies released by the sci-fi channel(and that is not saying much).
OK, that is not even a joke, it's a serious line not played for laughs, as earlier that character told mena he is in fact a vegetarian, and if that was meant as a joke, the direction was SO bad it certainly didn't come across that way.
I don't know why these awful children's films feel the need to use the deaths of thousands for cheap laughs, but it's a trend that is apparently spreading.
Its a romantic comedy that is not bittersweet.
There is something potentially fascinating about a successful doctor who aspires to be a member of a different species, one that is extinct to boot, but like so much of the rest of the movie, the joke is undercut by the tone of the rest of the film.
Unfortunately, that is all the way to the toilet.
Perhaps you might watch this (as it is being aired this month, December, 2007 on The Movie Channel (HD) for the same reason that I did (and that is to see what this documentary had to say about the man and his instrument, philosophy and some of the history behind the Moog synthesizer's and company's development), however the total impact of this piece greatly suffers both from what was included in the film and what was left out.
Get interviews with ALL the relevant people and use a soundtrack that is more diverse.
A cop who is nearly killed by a scandal that is outlined in the pilot and as well in later episodes.
He dies by his own devices - I get what the director may have been trying to convey, but could it have been any less dramatic and boring, I don't believe that is possible.
Feeling every inch like the tortured, angst-ridden romance that it should be, it's just so good to see a film that actually recreates the terror and fear that is associated with one's first love as opposed to overly sanitised teen love stories like "10 Things I Hate About You" or "Clueless".
to a movie that is really just a crappy chick-flick!
The reason you have not heard of this film is that no one saw it, and that is the way it should be.
But the gentle narrative eschews the obvious clichÃ©, and it's also nice to see a story set in a Scottish housing scheme that isn't just a tale of drugs and A.I.D.S.
The scene in Bill Forsyth's 1981 film Gergory's Girl that goes a long way in cementing just how special, just how close it is to the work of genius, is the one in which, on preparation for a date with a girl, the lead male character is reminded of a joke that is what we perceive as a really dirty and unnecessary one given the scenario.
The film establishes Gregory's thinking during the film's point of attack as that of one that isn't necessarily attuned to what it is that's around him, indeed, he likes football and girls but doesn't seem to put an awful lot of thought into them; somewhat dismissive of football as "just entertainment, for fun".
Meanwhile, may this documentary based on an attack on his person remind us that we cannot save everyone because that is why it takes a Michael Moore to awaken those who can't find the light switch on their own.
Nothing here but a boring and desperate attempt to convince us that everything is fine in America, while trying to make Moore an America hater and a liar, in a country that is full up to the neck, with lies.
Please make a waffle that isn't so bland and utterly boring.
That way, you can judiciously edit the film in much the same way you accuse me of doing - that is to say, so I look like a complete idiot - and also get to become a millionaire in the process."
2) Disarm the entire situation in a way that makes YOU look like the angry idiot, makes my fans applaud and cheer, and all by simply defending my position in much the same way I do everywhere - that is to say, with a little bit of vitriol.
Now Aragorn's action here is part of a much larger cohesion in Tolkien that is entirely absent in Jackson.
This film has only one thing going for it and that is Faith Clift.
Of course, this "program-clip" is referred to as a virus, a generic Hollywood name for anything that is not from AOL or Microsoft, even though it is the precise opposite of a virus - not only does it not replicate, but it removes itself.
There is no real need for improv acting in a movie, that is the great thing about the medium.
First of all no one that goes back like that is going to take the time to explain who all the modern counterparts are to the people they are describing and they aren't going to explain the philosophy of reincarnation just in case someone in the room doesn't get it.
This is a film that that is bent on making it into the long list of 'Terrible Dragon Movies' and it takes to its task with a dedication that's admirable.
In the end, this is just another generic chick flick that isn't anything special and its better if you just skip it.
And not to mention there was no doubt that is film is abysmally boring and dull.
So yeah that isn't a good sign.
For some reason, that is never explained, she falls in love with him.
When people aren't dying, the film is trying hard to present a story that is lacking in logic and fairly predictable.
The idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of American Society is hopeful,that makes it 2 out of ten.But this is not a movie.Is that the best someone can do with a great idea(the west-east clash).There are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a MAC* with the fingers of an Amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity(because she is just ignorant about the facts).The characters are not well shaped.And the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me.At the ending scene Lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen.And the background music says "...I will pray".The thing is not about religion actually.But it ends up with this.How you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray.The lights are already shining on the truth.Its just that nobody wants to see it.
All that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements, that boils down to nothing but clichÃ©s, and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience.
To sum up, A very slow-moving film with bad acting, bad dialouge, and something that looks like grape jelly being used for blood; that is "Ceremony".
I don't know if it is the film itself that is ridiculous, or the fact that so many well known TV and film stars are making complete idiots of themselves, and as for the songs, they don't help, oh, Fullerton talks to herself too much.
All of that is supposed to be "hilarious," to all the mainline film critics.
This is not the only Stephen King movie that is bad.
What does he plan to accomplish now that he controls everything that is electronic?
He's one of those characters that is scared to death from anything and everything, and still quips out the bad jokes.
I know Joe Karlosi (if he's still around, that is) won't be too pleased with my review of this one as I know this is one of his guilty pleasuresÂbut I have to say that my negative impressions were certainly amplified by the abysmal state (correct aspect ratio notwithstanding) of the print I watched which was replete with print damage and missing frames which not only managed to shorten the film to around 70 minutes (against the official 83!!)
Almost that is.
While I'm not a fan of this kind of humour, it is testament to England's ability to produce quality programmes that is echoed the world over.
Maybe that's the language that is used in this community, but it seems to add little to the content of the story of this man's life.
Unfortunately, that is not the case here.
start to end u will never find u scene to laugh on but that is the big reason to laugh to consider this movie a "COMEDY".
A film that is up there with the classic Ealing comedies and has every right to be classed alongside the best.
If that is really true (and not a publicity gimmick), I'll be the happiest!
Cut to someone sitting on bed with a big sheet over them, bouncing up and down for 3 seconds (that is supposed to be the aunt and nephew doing it under the covers).
There are too many stuff in this movie that is really cheesy, like a boy she just met Â she called him Boyfriend, who happen to get every jobs in London, who is also happen to be hired in the Lord's party to sing in the band that can play any song, just ordered!!.
I still think that the best-ever coming-of-age film is "Rebel without a Cause", but that is a tragic drama about situations outside most teenagers' experience.
It appears that everything on this show is evil and there are never any blue skies or any feelings of positive emotion that is not stemmed to some evil victory for the villain or the so called "hero", Dib.
The story is about a letter that is found in the first class airport lounge after an international flight has taken off.
In a nutshell, this film is one clichÃ© after another, but viewers might be able to feel the emotion and anger towards the characters, and that is what makes it a little more interesting.
There is one good sequence that is tense, but it is hard to care about the characters.
Final Score: 4.0 (out of 10)  The movie adaptation of Tom Clancy's "The Sum of All Fears" might be a starkly frightening movie, could be a cautionary tale of homeland terrorism and nuclear war - that is, if it wasn't caught in the confounding cinematic time-warp it finds itself in.
Not surprisingly, this is a rare film and it's one that is not worth tracking down.
(Maybe this film is made for adults, and maybe that is why I could not appreciate it; I'm sure it was probably a good book and had some good ideas.)
They have two German Shepherds who have just had a cute little puppy (the litter was apparently the smallest ever), and they cart the kids and the dogs off to a part of the wilderness that is sufficiently isolated enough for just the right amount of threat to occur.
Zoltan's eyes glow white almost all the time, except when they are uniformly black, that is.
Cheaply made horror film from the 70's that is surprisingly better than you might initially expect.
According to the director this movie was taken from him and butchered into the incomprehensible mess that is Cemetery High.
The production values are bottom of the barrel, at the beginning of the film the cast congregate in the TOA first class lounge that is supposed to be at JFK airport in New York, however the 'Theme Building' at LAX is clearly visible out the window as well as several palm trees.
"The Amazing Mr. No Legs" is a totally demented Â in idea as well as execution Â exploitation feature with a premise that is unique and refreshing and production values looking so cheap and amateurish that you simply have to show admiration for the cast and crew.
For just like the act of gambling itself, or indeed, not unlike the Air Bud movies, Owning Mahowny seems enticing at first, that is, when you and your friends are just planning to see it, joking that you might strike big, that this might be the one movie that comes out of nowhere to surprise you, but then from the moment you enter the theatre, every time you give this movie a chance, it's just one bad hand after the other, until eventually you are completely numb to it, and you stop paying attention to your wife, and you start cutting out of work early, and you no longer enjoy anything again in life anymore because all you want is your Owning Mahowny.
It was very accurate...but that's all that is going for this film.
And that is where this movie fails miserably (along with the other fore-mentioned issues).
It is however beautifully shot and lit in many scenes, but even a polished turd is still a turd, and that is essentially what you have here with DePalma's latest offering.
If you want a good family movie there are so many other choices - everything from The Lion King to Finding Nemo to Back to the Future(well I am not sure if that is exactly a family but it is certainly a hell of a lot better than Rebound).
The main problem with Rebound is that it never comes together; it's that kind of movie that is sorta made by two directors with opposite purposes: light-hearted humor and deep thoughtful drama.
For those who defend this film saying that is a kid's movie, I should defend children's rights to have intelligent options, like Pixar and Dreamworks had been doing lately.
The Fly II isn't the astounding train wreck some have made it out to be, but it is a lackluster sequel that is often ludicrously boring.
I especially liked the scenes of Gin practicing avoiding lasers simulated by strands of yarn  Of course Robert and Gin have a romantic tension that is complicated by the rules of being a thief.
Pierce Bronson plays Danny O'Neill, a member of the FBI bomb squad that stumbles on a plot consisting of corrupt Senators and a new form of explosive that is in the form of drinking water - when mixed with acidity of the human stomach, one becomes a walking time bomb that even the strongest Alka-Seltzer wouldn't cure.
This low-budget end to Ms. Mansfield's career is a curious mix of emptiness and hope that is hard to put your finger on.
It's a tacky, flashback-framed fiasco that is filled with two-person scenes, and in every sequence the characters keep saying each other's names: "Hey, Flo?"
At least I think that is what the main plot thread was?
Now, Sylvia is the secretary and love object of Dr. Kessling, who is the man who is responsible for transporting the sarcophagus to a museum, and he also seems to have discovered the secret of its occupant, who manages to change places with an incoming professor and take his place, that is, after that particular poor soul is run over by a steam roller, egad.
The singing is among the most high-pitched and ear-shattering, the songs are dull, the acting (at times) is suspect, the film features comic relief (Leon Erol) that isn't all that funny and the love story is rather creepy.
Sadly, that isn't the only reason this sucks.
...it might come back as a sequel that is even worse than this one.
The Peter Cook/Dudley Moore original had a cynical bite that is completely missing here.
thing, but even that gets ruined by a line that follows it that is basically "Only two kinds of people know it(referring to Karate), the Chinese and the King.
"One night stand" certainly isn't a bad movie, it even doesn't bore one minute, but it's just a bit too empty and you can't blame the actors as Wesley Snipes plays his role perfect but actors are bound to the script, a script that is a bit too much like those telemovies that are based on true stories.
I swear I could feel my brain cells literally melting away as I watched this cheese fest that is when it wasn't being utterly overwhelmed by the almost vomiting inducing level of political correctness constantly a presence in this film.
I'm sure several people will like this movie and that is fine, everyone has different tastes.
Its the sort of thing that is gang busters if you're four or five, but any if you're older its an endurance test.
They take everything that is worst about academia and translate it into film.
Stahl looks such a twit in his ensign's uniform with a hat that is seven sizes too big.
Julie Walters is usually fantastic especially in the type of character that is required of her here, James Fox starred in one of my favourite films, and I honestly used to think that I would enjoy Nick Stahl in any role - he usually brings such pathos to his characters.
From whats-her-name making inane comments to the 'suggestive' language that is used, they took a family show and made it into some wannabe burlesque strip show, with baggy pants clowns as some of their guests and a wannabe host that doesn't hold a candle to Gary Moore.
Dracula: Dead and Loving It is a comedy that isn't very funny & a horror that has no horror, it fails at everything it tries to do.
It's the kind of movie that is hidden on the lowest shelf at your local videostore, covered in dust.
The repetitious wallet-losing has potential for comedy that is totally lost.
He has a Mexican comic sidekick that is not very funny and a Wayne Sleep look-alike that bounces on hidden trampolines through out most of the film.
I suppose we are to also assume that the moon is made of green cheese and that is how these absurd creatures survive.
Sure, they're played by Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin, Kevin Kline, Woody Harrelson, John C. Riley, Lindsay Lohan, and company, but, the bottom line is you won't see anything out of these actors that is going to re-enforce why you like them to begin with.
Nothing like that is in the film.
Maybe that is the scary part.
I'd have to put this in that category; ego-driven, non talented piece of decadence that is messing it up for REAL talented young filmmakers that could have used that budget and that cast to make something GREAT & FUNNY or at least GOOD.
If you want a good movie or a bad movie that is okay to laugh at, look elsewhere.
The rappelling and caving however is crap, the cave exploring that is shown in the movie is totally wrong.
This is one of those flicks that is just inexcusably bad.
and finally What is the point of the scene where people get shot on a bridge..., if the guy is dreaming..., why that is the only scene that merely brushes with the reality I know about the revolution, when everything else feels artificial and farfethced  !!!FLAMING:!!!
The only way to let the audience forget asking why this why that is a good, captivating plot.
I've noticed most people who defend this show are Christians, and as much as I'd love to do some well-placed bashing, I won't, because I happen to have a lot of friends who are Christians and yet laugh themselves silly at the idiocy that is "7th Heaven".
The only problem with that is that Peter Lind Hayes is a truly awful actor.
The usual crumpled curtains are loosely hanging on the back wall, and the stage set of mis matched drapery even has one dark main rag that is yanked back and forth as each amateur sequence elbows past the previous one.
Touching a political topic, it doesn't offer any political illumination (that is to say, no interesting QUESTION), dialogues (apart from the intense beginning) are paper-like, the story has no development (I mean: even in the petrification there have to be developments, if not we should do a painting instead of a movie), and acting is scarcely bearable.
I mean, I agree with the main point of the reviews, that is to say the extraordinary performance of Hannelore Elsner as the main character, a leninistic writer, smoke- and sleeping pills-addicted, who just after the fall of the wall decides to leave the capitalistic Federal Republic of Germany and to move to the socialistic East Berlin.
show) to produce another abomination that is sure to attract fans of the kids magazine called W.I.T.C.H (obviously initials for the characters' names, which you can see on its opening title.
when that is true then the movie can't be great =D=D=D (not to dis myself, but to be honest) stay away from this crap.
The effects are bad, the characters and situations predictable, the monster really badly drawn, but it's another one of those movies that is so bad, you can enjoy laughing at it.
The movie works rather well and has a rather good cast too, Bruce Campbell is in it too and that is always a plus as he adds a spark near the end of the movie.
And never mind that his obnoxious whining drowns out crucial expository information that is supposed to set into motion the events that make up the remainder of the film.
He blends all these into an original little horror that is effective and interesting from start to finish.
If you want to see this movie, i recommend you either see the trailer ( as that is enough for you, to litterily, call every scene in the movie) or you go out and buy Atlantis and just Imagine it with smurfs instead of underwater people.
There is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning, but even that is done without any care for how it is shot.
end of spoilers  The end of the movie is about the only thing that isn't totally predictable.
Director Nico Mastorakis has made a cynical cash-grabber (by his own admission) that is too cynical to impress anybody but a sophomore genre fan.
The most extreme, confronting genre pics, to paraphrase a character in VIDEODROME, "have a philosophy"; that is what makes them dangerous.
I understand that this film didn't have a huge box office life (if any) and that is a real shame.
1st watched 10/21/2009 Â 7 out of 10 (Dir-Lucky McKee): Scary, atmospheric chiller about a girls boarding school in the woods that is haunted by something.
This allows viewers the feeblest of intellectual excuses to watch soap operatic nonsense spiced with everything that is bad about human beings.
Okay first i want to say even if i'm a Turk i don't like these type of movies but still i wanted to say a few things.The first movie 'DÃ¼nyayÄ± Kurtaran Adam' was a total disaster everyone in Turkey makes fun of it because it was made seriously as a sci-fi movie and they stole many things from Star Wars.But the second movie is a comedy.Now the MOST important thing in a world class comedy film is to make EVERYONE on the planet laugh,but it doesn't mean that you have to make everyone laugh to make an ordinary comedy movie,i read that one commenter said that its not even close to funny,now i'm from turkey and believe me there are MANY European and American movies people from here don't laugh at and there are many movies you people don't laugh at,this films aim is Turkish population because Turkish sense of humor isn't same with the others,actually EVERY countries sense of humor is different with other countries so MY OPINION is that it doesn't make sense to say 'not even close to funny' to a 'comedy' movie that isn't in your country because it may not suit your sense of humor but people here liked it not very much but still they liked it,so please make your comments on comedy movies according to these things..i'm sorry if my English was bad..
This movie is not only an unimaginably unsuccessful sequel to a movie that is unimaginably naive and problematic but also uses the very fundamental elements of GORA, like main actor starring both as the antagonist and the protagonist.
I'd rather listen to Faith No More with my Algerian friends than deal with their "Silence concertoes", whatever that is.
Fine, they wanna make a movie that offends everybody that isn't as bad because it isn't a "racist" movie.
And that is the way to approach a movie like this otherwise you surely get disappointed.
They will be able to feel the emotions of the mother and will be indignant at the attitude of the grandmother - and that is quite understandeable.
maybe seeing the remake first clouded my judgement a little even so its still crap, over all my rating is 1 out 10 and that is purely cause there is no Zero score.
through-out the book you can feel the injustice, but again that is not the theme.
Given that, the scenes are pretty risque: bottomless front shots of women and all that (that is, if you see the unrated version, I guess).
Apart from a few (a very few) witty lines and Marilyn Monroe's "buh-die-YAM-a-sewious-actwess" scenes, and of course a Berlin score that is, at worst, musically interesting, I found myself rolling my eyes at random leaps in time and logic, underwhelming characterization and some of the worst editing I've ever seen in feature film.
Even the best song the film has to offer, `Alexander's Ragtime Band,' (done terrifically by Alice Faye in the movie of that title) is terribly abused here, presented in a lengthy and contrived manner that is beyond repair.
That's what's good about the movie, it builds up quite slowly (also because actually there is not much story to build up) and when we are fully aware of the threats, the viewer is also aware of the fact that one cannot escape from a mysterious force that is everywhere around you.
If you want to see a nice horror that is a bit different from the ordinary watch this!
The plot may sound interesting, but after Klaatu makes it clear what his purpose is, the movie becomes a downgraded half-assed chase movie that is more boring than it is thrilling.
with an almost overwhelming sound design that is understandably too much for some people.
There is a unity of artistic elements, with cinematography, art direction, music, sound and acting that blend seamlessly into a coherent style that is more important to the film than the details of the story.
(Oh wait that is what Reeves calls 'acting')   Jennifer Connelly was terrible also.
One sphere that is shown on the back of a pick-up truck being attacked by flame-throwers in some foreign desert town inexplicably contains squid, because, well, the shadows of squid inside a giant sphere look kinda neat, that's why!
My TiVo automatically records shows with Gale Harold in them, and that is the only reason this movie ever even came across my radar.
then that is fine.
This whole film is mainly a riff on the idea of the south that most outsiders have, a view that is mainly perpetuated by Hollywood.
The South depicted in this film died with the founding of the TVA, if it hadn't died prior, and frankly it disgusts me that people from Canada and elsewhere are viewing this film and thinking that is at all an accurate depiction of the South.
country scene in this region I don't know, but it can potentially warp lots of minds and that is depressing.
This film masquerades as a rediscovery or celebration of something the "South" has kept which the rest of America has lost, but if you were to ask White exactly what that is, he couldn't give you a straight answer.
Ah, you might say that is not too bad.
Leprechaun 2 is worse,and that is rated 18.
Any film that is so bad that it doesn't even get unintentional-laugh points (except for two), has got to have an overwhelming amount of flaws.
Do yourselves a favour next time you want to watch this stuff turn it off and pick out a movie doc like 'When we were Kings' now that is art
This is one of the most illogical TV movies ever made -- and that is saying a lot.
The jokes are really juvenile and the style of the movie gives it a really cheesy effect, and no that isn't a positive thing.
My only criticism with this film is that is seemed to try to hit too many emotional chords in too short a span of time.
Parents should be aware that there is absolutely nothing in this film that is inappropriate for children.
The reality is that the credit card companies previously didn't expand into these untapped markets precisely because they were way to risky and would result in more losses from credit that is never repaid than profits from late fees interest.
I'm not saying all that is entirely untrue, but the fact is the primary design of the bill was to stop the trend of people using bankruptcy as the easy way out even when there were other ways to escape their problems.
Clay isn't much better since he seems to be reacting to a scene that is playing in his head and not what is going on in front of him.
I am really amazed how bad acting can really be, I guess that is an art too... You could not make it worse with the old form of Russian synchronization in movies, where every role is spoken by one (male) person and every sentence begins with "he sais" or "she sais"... Or wait a minute, is it maybe a new form of comedy?
Now that is funny and sarcastic at the same time!
The only thing that is really done properly is the clown faces, which have a lot of character and might even scare young children.
Now that is a worthwhile mission.
All in all, this movie is a long experience that isn't as new or as interesting as the first one.
(I, and the other ten people who saw this film made quite a good profit for the producer, who happens to be Raimi, allegedly; if that is true, why the hell is he wasting time with this kind of crap?
The gore parts, which is why most people watch these types of movies are good for the tiny budget, every penny spent us up there on the screen, but that is it's only saving grace.
I understand the intentions of the producers, they wanted to show to the viewers, that there was a few kids that have been charged with murder and put to death penalty... but that is only theoretical truth, deathpenaltyinfo.org on this page you can see all the people punished with death sentence, for the crime they've committed, when they were under aged... as you can see all the defendants were 17, not 14, when they committed the crime... And by the time they were killed, years have past.
One element of the movie that is missing in the reviews I've read so far is the musical score.
To make it even worse, this is a "director's cut" which in this case means that you get a movie that is even more boring than the theatrical release.
So, she gets an illegal abortion that is apparently botched.
Another problem is that although up until the end you are never sure if the haunting is really the aborted child or just a manifestation of the guilt the lady feels about her past actions, the uncertainty and psychological aspects of the film (the best things about ARAF) are completely done away with--providing an ending that is just too well defined.
Editing is ridiculous' Directing is very amateurish' Producing is unprofessional' SO How can we say that is a movie!
this is one of those "christian" propaganda films that is trying to be "spooky" but it just comes across as boring and stupid.
If you happen to fall into the majority of the world's population that isn't Christian, or the even larger majority that isn't *fundamentalist* Christian, you'll get a glimpse into the eerie world of apocolyptic Christian prophecy (or, even worse, a glimpse into what happens when no gay people are involved in the making of a major motion picture).
that is sooooo old, and this wasn't the only one too.
Denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie.
This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully.
There isn't any will to direct the attention to those mischievous aspects of the modern society that have smoothed the way for cynical and opportunist people ready to profit from every occasion to reach their own purposes, taking advantage of the good faith of the Ecclesiastic Authority (an hypothesis never contemplated in the movie) to acquire dignity, prestige and perpetuate privilege positions, especially through the safest way, that is to say the sanctification of a frail, poor wretch with the only fault of having given birth to five heartless sons.
The original title "Down the Shore" was considered but changed because that is an expression that is used only by the people in the Philadelphia area.
You have a super secret agency of the government that is made up of well armed men.
Guess what, that is called a dead virus since in 12 minutes it can't get very far.
And then imagine every cliched action movie moment (that is even vaguely appropriate for a submarine or even airplane).
Basically this film is a very clichÃ© action film that is not in anyway stylish or well scripted but it is funny, notably the bad Russian accents and the puns, one of which had me in stitches when Dolphs sergeant is briefing him on his mission saying "have you ever heard of agent red" and Dolph replies " it sounds like a bad action movie", so at least the makers of this new they were not making a classic, overall this is not horrendous but is still pretty bad,you could quite easily stomach the full ninety minutes on a good day, if only for the hilariously cheesy dialogue but if you have a choice between this and an earlier Dolph flick theplace this nicely back on the shelf.
There is one saving grace though, after watching the performances in this stinker, you'll be appreciating the master thespianism that is one Jean Claude Van Damme.
First of, trying to learn about Ned Kelly from watching this movie is just impossible, the story trail is as lose as the one in Dune and it jumps so fast from scene to scene that is unbelievable.
If that is the case, then the whole point of worship is a waste of time (if you don't even trust the Bible to convey the stories accurately).
There is the film called "Jacob" with Mathew Modine that is superb, including each important detail from the Bible (the only authentic source) and it even manages to show the dream of "Jacob's Latter" in a scene that seems to me as completely possible as authentic.
There is a series of 5 films produced by TNT that is infinitely superior and can be purchased as a set.
Yes, SURVIVAL RUN starts off with a 70s van that is soon going to crash into the deserted wasteland.
This is a film that is too bad even for MST3K - it makes its own laughs.
A sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funny, and these days you won't even be able to go to a Berni Inn in your Austin Maxi to refresh your jaded palate after watching.
The third segment, that is the only good one in this movie, is a sick and totally goofy version of Goldylocks, with the blonde girl as a crazy serial killer of young boyfriends that makes a strange alliance with the Bear family (in fact, a sort of mixture between Bonnie and Clyde and a farmer family coming out of Lil Abner) and find her true love in Baby.
The movie has a cool box cover, but that is all.
The only sequence that is really worth mentioning is a female stripper that goes all the way.and I do mean ALL the way.
But that is all that there is to say by comparison to the original story.
Poorly directed with a totally predictable 'twist' ending that is thoroughly unsatisfying.
Right now it has a 6.6 - that is a failure of the rating system.
Face it - the emperor has no clothes; that is, Corman stinks.
The situations and dialogue appear routine, but nothing that is said or done is hackneyed or banal.
Especially Cannon who seems to be plastic surgeon-ed out of her face - but that is beside the point.
that is, if they haven't already sold it for $1.50 to get some space for a movie someone will rent.
It is hard to decide which element of this film is the worst: the acting, which is stiff, yet glistening with the desperation of young, hungry actors trying to find meaning in this piece of dreck; the writing, in which the aching banality is broken up only by the sense of irritation that is the inevitable outcome of listening to the ill-considered opinions of dullards; or the cinematography, which is flat, insipid and unattractive.
A narration goes on for the entire length of the movie, explaining everything that is happening Â however due to the incoherent nature of the film it's the ONLY way of understanding what's happening!
"The Purple Rose of Cairo" does this in a silly, satirical way, but occasionally a line will be spoken that is quite poignant (as Allen does well more overtly in his other films).
The movie is about problems of actors, lots of extremely boring dialogs about art, blah, blah, blah - a really depressing "commedy" movie that is supposed to be enjoyable or even funny.
that is until he spends half the movie wearing pyjamas, and no matter how much effort (and believe me, he puts in too much effort) he puts into his role, he will always be Carlton from the 'Fresh Price of Bel Air'.
Akshay Kumar and Ritesh Deshmukh sounds a good combination for a comedy movie and that is the reason I went for the movie (promos also looked promising).
I'm having trouble even putting in to words what it was that is wrong with this movie, so bear with me while I try my hardest...
And that is not a compliment.
Another sad example of a trailer that is better than the movie itself.
I didn't think any of the situations she ended up in were clever, and the settings were very mundane--unforgivable for a movie that is meant to be a journey or a "day in the life."
It is this dual personality that is the main fault of Click, because it simply exists at two opposite poles.
The film only runs for about seventy five minutes (not including closing credits), and the vast majority of that is filler.
The way that they are used doesn't inspire the imagination, however, and that is a shame as this film could actually have been quite scary if done correctly.
If it's rated U or something...that is stupid.
The attack is not shown in detail but in a suggestive manner that is perhaps even more disturbing in that it allows the viewer to complete the images in their mind's eye.
However, the actors in it are obviously more talented than the weak script warrants, and the issue of sexual dysfunction could indeed have been treated in a way that is both humorous and at the same time enlightening - something the film failed completely at.
A stack of TNT is tossed in the air, then easily blown up by lead bits from shotgun, thereby causing extensive damage to a very secure "open" drilled tunnel that is very sound.
So the idea is rent an RV and go driving, and that is where the fun begins.
Add to that budgetary problems Â Puck, Oberon, and gang appear as green-tinted hippies, with their faces not even matching the hue of their bodies Â and you have a production that is easier to laugh at than with.
Glossy costume drama that is inert for two thirds of the movie.
For example, in an early scene when Adamson returns to Britain and is feted at a private ball, instead of using authentic music to nail the period effect and introduce all the elegant and subtle feelings that run beneath the Victorian surface, Balanescu concocts a drone that is an explicit imitation of locusts.
This is one of those few movies that is just so dreadful I couldn't stand to watch more than half of it.
Chalk one up for the marketers, who created warm and enticing packaging for a film that is emotionally distant at best.
I know you didn't want one to be really powerful...so don't worry... the last surviving human, a lady that is way too gungho about being a guide in ice wasteland BEFRIENDS the last surviving predator... it would seem that predators are nice guys after all.... he cuts off an aliens head and tail and gives them to her... tail for a spear, and head to fit over her entire left arm for some sort of shield......
The end is obviously open for a sequel...I say, bring back Ridley Scott or James Cameron for the love of all that is holy...because they are the only ones that could save this franchise now.
How can you compare a high tech civilization that is able to travel space to Indians?
I don't encourage illegal free downloads but that is the only way the purchace of this movie is a good price,a pathetic director at his most pathetic.
Wait, that is including the 12 minutes of credits, isn't it....yeah it is.
See, you KNOW that is more entertaining.
And for a film that is obviously meant to be action-packed, it certainly isn't.
Paul, a complex story is good, only if you know how to write that is.
It's about a pyramid that is discovered on Earth in Antarctica.
That is all that is mentioned.
And then maybe when I'm even older and I've lived long enough -- this crowd will be watching this on TV Land and saying the same thing when another program by another youngster that is just the same comes out.
If Jennifer Garner is a good actress, you can't tell from the creative mess that is Alias.
Maybe that would distract us from the real purpose and that is the life of Emily Dickinson.
I would understand this if the story was about Algerian immigrants or second generation Algerians in Europe, but that is not the case.
I like watching international movies, always hoping to see something that is new, or seeing something through a different point of view, but I simply felt cheated watching this movie.
In a country that is awash with guns and violence, its hard to believe that a state security officer will go to great lengths to murder a prostitute who he thinks stole his gun.
If there is a God, and after seeing this movie you'll really question that, he will "strike down with great vengeance and furious anger" those responsible for this turd that is so in need of flushing.
The only positive comment I can make about this excuse for a movie is the twist ending where there is actually a scene that is interesting to watch.
If you want to see a truly great fake documentary, I highly recommend GHOSTWATCH - an excellent piece of work that is carefully scripted, genuinely puts you on the edge of your seat, contains great scares and still makes you question what you've seen even when you know it's a phony.
If you want to see a great horror movie done in the style of a camcorder home video, I highly recommend REC, a fast-paced thrill ride from beginning to end that is genuinely scary and tense.
Imagine renting the Terminator and instead of seeing some science fiction action, you get to see a lower than a straight-to-DVD quality movie about something that is supposed to resemble the Terminator.
I can only think of one thing more incomprehensible than making a movie from a bad script and that is for a filmmaker to base his idea for a movie on another movie that is terrible.
"Orange County" isn't nearly as bad as the majority of teen movies out today, but that isn't a saying a lot - and that's about all there is to say for it.
Firstly, it hangs on the tails of the 'Broken Britain' tedious myth that is perpetrated and propagated by the likes of the Daily Mail.
And that is only one of the reasons why this film is ridiculous.
He gives a performance that is deeply emotional and mature.
They wind up with a fortune; that is, a fortune in confederate bonds.
One that is not classical.
Talking of Turkey I thought their entry was probably the best on the night , a sort of ska inspired track played by an actual band , but the winner was The Ukraine which seemed to have stolen their style from that sword and sorcery show from New Zealand   A well staged and organised musical event but an event that is well past its sell by date and which should hopefully be scrapped in the near future
No, this has something to say, and that is an anti-meat message.
even those who are bush supporters would have to admit that this speech and the propaganda that is spouted by laurens character during the film is at least as true (if not more true) if you replace words like 'terrorist' and 'muslim' with 'soldier' and 'american' or 'christian'.
Basically, that is it.
Is he going to get an academy award for something that is not his?
Yes, Swinton gives a good performance, and yes the costumes are good, but that is just about all there is to this motion picture.
It is not a bad thing that Our Heroes "win" the day, but that they win without any effort; they win when others are so clearly superior; they win by being the biggest retards on stage - and that is supposedly how you win.
Unfortunately, that is hardly a sufficient foundation upon which to build a quality movie, and "Kickin' it Old Skool" ultimately emerges as a wan, not-very-funny cross between "Footloose" and all those inexplicably popular flicks in which a youngster mysteriously wakes up in an adult person's body.
Well-known writers Stephen J. Cannell of "The A-Team" and Philip DeGuere of "Simon & Simon" have contrived a formulaic, half-baked World War II secret mission behind enemy lines that is neither convincing nor exciting.
Other than this one, that is.
For Ted the Bellhop, things go from strange, to stranger, to even stranger in the comedy "Four Rooms," a film that is really four films by four separate teams of filmmakers, all linked by location and a single character under increasingly urgent circumstances.
the worst thing about that is that he's also the director, so he gives himself plenty of screen time.
Leslie will never be as funny as he was years ago,it would take a miracle,the reason being he is accepting all these ridiculous scripts,just because hes in it doesnt mean it will change anything.Spy Hard has a very few funny scenes,and i find this film very similar to Nielsons other unfunny films like "DRACULA DEAD & LOVING IT" & "WRONGFULLY ACCUSED".I always wished their would be another Naked Gun,that is the only way Nielson can get his spoof fame back,now he is the same as any other star like Charlie Sheen in a spoof movie.
this movie is billed as a spoof/comedy,but it's not really funny.there are 1 or 2 mildly amusing moments,but mostly it's just silly,without being funny.this movie would work as an actual spy movie,except that you have the expectation that you will laugh.it's gonna be hard to get the required 10 lines of text in here,but i'll try.i think the problem is the filmmakers tried too hard to get laughs.sometimes you can go too far with a joke and it ends up as flat as a pancake.so the movie isn't really funny,but it does have 1 redeeming feature.that is the casting of Andy Griffith(TV's Matlock and the Andy Griffith show) as a maniacal nut case who plans to either destroy the world or rule it.Griffith is great in this movie.he has so much fun in the role.Barry Bostwick is also good for some comic relief.but overall,the movie is not good.the most i can squeeze out for "Spy Hard" is a 4/10
There are worse movies and there are far better movies, but I honestly watched it because I'm in the process of watching Ewan McGregor movies because he has this presence that is so strong that you just have to watch his work because he draws you in, and you end up sitting there watching, totally mesmerized.
And that is what is wrong with this series.
It is that very in your face honestt that is missing.
Oh yeah watch out for the sly stereotypes as well, like the stupid policeman that is Irish, OH THE HILARITY!
There's also Drax's space station that is invisible from radar (yes, but optical telescopes and the naked eye don't require radar).
The best scenes are the free fall moments from a plane in the pre-title sequence, Bond's spin (literally) in a centrifuge machine and the death of Hugo Drax's secretary (who Bond has bedded) at the hands of some vicious mastiffs - a scene that is a bit jarring amongst the rest of the campy and less serious than usual action scenes.
If that is not the definition of an anti-climax I do not know what is.
Yet, screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (that is the craziest stage name I've ever heard!)
Overall an interesting movie that is likely to herald the start of a potentially significant contribution from Russia to the international action genre but as a stand alone entity it is average at best.
Brazilian football star Ronaldo appears as a guest star, but that is both unnecessary and not funny at all.
invite Guests onto your show and then cut off their Microphones when they voice an opinion that is different to your own.
If everyone would watch this movie, take a second to think about what they feel, and then take out of it the message that rings true to them, this movie will have had the effect a journalistic piece should have, even though I doubt that is the effect it was aiming at.
The characters are memorable, especially as Henry Winkler plays a role that is a complete departure from previous roles and he does so convincingly.
Unfortunately, that is about the end of the positives.
The screenwriter of Taxi Driver has made a film that is a very good candidate to the title of The Worst Movie Ever Made.
It's main characters are a rich plantation owner that is part Indian and his daughter who own slaves and her anti-slavery friend that has a slave?
"Karaula" is a cinematic equivalent of those 1980s hammy pop-folk-rock-whatever-happens-to-be-selling-at-the-moment-that is-what-we-play Bijelo dugme clones (Merlin, Hari Mata Hari, Valentino, Plavi orkestar, Divlje jagode, Regina) - a populist, don't-you-dare-go-deeper-than-the-outer-layer, watchable but ultimately quickly forgettable experience.
As for dancing, what a dumb activity that is.
Scream 3 just doesnt have the formula that the last two did,and what I mean by that is Scream 3 isnt scary,the same old thing happens,and worst of all,it isn't entertaining.
Mixed bag horror film that is has some really great images and a sense of things being really off that are under cut by a lack of budget (The death by model plane that starts everything is laughable as are some of the other deaths) and performances that aren't all there, with some of the cast seeming to have come from who ever was around that day.
and that is all that needs to be said.
But that isn't enough to warrant this movie a viewing.
Towards the beginning, there is a scene where Anniston and Vaughn's families meet at dinner and you realize how Vaughn and Anniston's relationship is slowly declining...that is where it lost its spunk.
Do so wish it would be copied on DVD that is compatible with USA TVs.
Matthau has job and family problems, and the family matters are a loose end that is never resolved by the film's end, nor is Dern's relationship with nurse.
I would suggest that the makers of this film take a long vacation, a long way away from their usual haunts and let time heal their unfortunate souls if that is indeed possible.
To help out the greedy people, huge birds that no land person has ever seen flies them to the land, and they must confront a "Chosen One" (no really, that is how the put it) and show them the way.
So that is why no person has seen them.
And that is about 15 people.
This film's ending resolves itself in a fashion that is entirely unconvincing and abstract.
Because it gives you an idea on how this movie is, it should have been called "The Crud" because that is all I got out of this piece of junk.
In addition, to add another creepier element, Brandon was killed in an on-set accident where he was killed by a prop gun---something that is in the plot of GAME OF DEATH--when a bad guy pretends to be using a prop gun but really shoots Bruce in the face!!!!
Movie tells the story of Billy Lo, a famous Kung fu action star that is being bullied into joining a syndicate.
The concept of the story is reasonable, but the concept is all that is delivered.
But I guess that is, again, all part of that unique "tone" with Italian horror that is so disarming.
I know it's just a show but even a show can remind you to follow your heart, keep a strong will, and overcome anything that is thrown at you and I feel that this was an excellent "foght for survival" story.
Spader's character has him having sex with Holly Hunter, in addition to this he even has a homo-erotic encounter with a guy (not that I have anything against homosexuality whatsoever that is).
Sometimes, hating characters is good and can be done cleverly: disliking an evil character or not liking the ways in which certain characters go about their business can also be good fun but when you see a film that is just a barrage of sex scenes, bizarre characters talking like they're in some sort of drug induced stupor and silly, unbelievable developments; it's very difficult to not only switch your mind off to what's going on but also be tempted to not switch the film off.
There is one scene that is constructed and shot in such a way that it could resemble a sex scene in a film even though it's not.
If I am going to watch extremely graphic sexual perversions, I would prefer them to be in a film that is a little more thoughtful and a lot less pretentious.
At least, that is what anyone would have thought before seeing "Crash".
He and his small retinue bump into a passing Viking gang, and for reasons never explained Ahmet must join a band of 13 Vikings in a mission to help a semi-feudal village that is under attack.
Wesley Snipes headlines a good cast that is sadly wasted in this picture.
If I have anything good to say, David Gant was pleasantly over the top as the mastermind behind the whole project, there's a nice pair of breasts, and the theme that is revealed in about the last fifteen minutes of the movie in a tossed-off manner of the fallacies of love & trust was pretty neat and I'd like to see it implemented in a good movie next time.
Prague is a truly beautiful city and that is about the only positive aspect of this movie.
Before that is alot of drama, and after that is the rescue, and that's all, folks.
A huge snow wedge hangs over the resort, loosely hanging on a snow-capped mountain that is broken off once a small charter plane crashes into it.
Another hilarious scene would involve a 'gas' explosion inside the resort that is nothing more than a 'puff of smoke' that sends one chef flying backwards into some shelves and an unlucky female that goes sliding along a counter while knocking off bowls of food onto the floor.
Here, rescue workers scramble to rescue the child using a safety net below, yet the man that is left dangling spends about three minutes complaining that he cannot 'let go' and when he finally does (as a result of getting electrocuted), his lifeless body misses the safety net anyway!
One reason to check out a dead-ender like this is for its glimpse of teenagers past, that is, of how Hollywood framed teens during the stressed-out war year of 1944.
'In the Shadows,' AKA 'Under Heaven' and 'In the Garden,' is at least a two-hankie drama that is based on 'Wings of the Dove.'
She seems indifferent to her part (for good reason it seems to me), and speaks her lines with a flatness that is almost comical.
If you said four, based on the fact that that is how they are packaged on DVD into a two-disc four-film box-set, then you would be mistaken - there were in fact FIVE films to this series, this last one coming fourteen years after the last effort, "The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery".
However due to the ridiculous dialog and the hardcore sex scenes the film MIGHT be worth it for drunken party type viewing, but even that is stretching it (pardon the pun) Feel free to skip this one, as it's only remote interesting as a curiosity.
This movie makes it seem as though corporations should be boycotted as a whole, and that is wrong.
I am trying to figure out how someone who invests so much money into publicly traded securities can make a movie that is directly in conflict with his behavior.
There used to be a saying about "innocent until proved guilty" that is supposed to be their attitude.
It conforms perfectly to the feel-good foreign fluff that has flooded the market at least since _Cinema Paradisio_; that is, it embodies to a "t" the safe, lowest-common-denominator American conception of what a foreign film "should" be.
One, is a writer who is shopping around a book that is bad.
So that is about all there is to it.
However, you also get to see a chase scene at the end that is to long and rather anti-climatic and the other guys in the heist are rather bad in how they are presented.
Its a winning combination that is definitely a chick movie and will also pull in the crowd hungry for nostalgia.
Thornton plays a gym teacher from hell, that is just so mean to his students and almost anyone else, but his teaching techniques are very appreciated in the community... alright, STOP!
Due to being a fan of the first Scream and having liked James Tobacks Black and White.I was keen on seeing how this film would be with both of them working together,and though it tries to be a smarter Indicent Proposal (a film that is referenced a lot during the movie)is just ends up becoming very boring and painfully slow.
When they meet Queen Muset that is when things really go wrong!
We can only speculate as to whether that is a case of art imitating life.
On the verge of losing his job at a two star hotel, he becomes involved in an incident (which I won't reveal here) that is so muddled, so badly played out and so unbelievable that I found it hard to believe that the rest of the motivations of the characters in this movie, rested on it.
Tempo shows the waste of money that is plastic surgery all over Melanie's face.
It would be nice to see once a Hindi movie that is not taken off from American Movies.
Comeon, come up with a movie that is original....can Bollywood do that on a consistent basis..??
Not original, unsatisfactory payoff, and some scenes with a waterfall that I guess takes takes you to a separate section of the forest that is otherwise inaccessible.
A promising start, a plot that is interesting, some interesting act at the beginning... but hey, don't get yourself enjoying yet.
There are a few scares in this movie but all of which are of the cheap variety for example "ghostly shadow walks past in background" "deathly face in mirror" "hand coming out of the ground" the list really does go on and that is where all the scares come from seriously.
And although he is the best thing in it, that isn't saying much.
But that isn't really his fault.
This is an incredibly tasteless tale that is reputed to be the story of the notorious Ma Barker and her demented criminal sons.
Just once I'd like to see this great writer's stories rendered in a way that isn't just to turn all the characters into generic knights in shining armor.
I bought the DVD for $3 (US), and I feel as though I've been ripped off...that alone should give you an idea how bad it is--and it's not the kind of bad horror movie that is so bad it's good.
It was released straight to video and that is a obvious sign of lacking.
But that is just what the filmmakers do.
I'm guessing, but my feeling is that what we see in the movie that is not in the original story is: (1) The scientist did not have a long-lost daughter (2) There was no romantic connection between the boy's Mum and the scientist (2) No little villager girl actually connected with the boy, or caught the blue butterfly (4) The scientist did not fall down a hole, forcing the boy to make his own way through the jungle.
In this movie you strain to find ANYTHING at all that is confirmed by the historical record amidst the farrago of nonsense and fiction presented as the life of Rome's bad-boy artist-emperor.
and where marvels of every imaginable, possible kind, and beyond, never cease... that is, until now.
Once again, here an Australian film that is let down utterly by its mediocre screenplay.
To profit from that is completely reprehensible.
for its unflinching look at an obviously insane woman and the equally insane justice system that is about to execute her.
Even a low paying job you don't like would be better than a low paying one that you don't like that is incredibly dangerous.
It was fascinating to watch the "Making of" featurette that is included on the DVD release, which repeatedly alternates between scenes from the original documentary and scenes from the HBO movie.
The Beales are beautiful in the sense of honesty and thinking in the moment, with reasoning behind anything and everything that is done.
Very violent, but most of that is in your mind.
It is bad, but then, that is part of what taking a date to the Drive-In was about.
The makers of Finbar have obviously learned a lesson from this, and have made a film that is totally un-commercial.
Mafia hit men fighting the undead is an original idea, but the director who also starred spent too much time trying to make hisself look cool, but that is hard to do when you can't act.
Nobody likes a bad movie, but sometimes you come across one that is so extremely bad it actually becomes enjoyable.
Director Martin Munthe's idea of paying homage to his favorite slasher films (Friday the 13th) is by making one that is even worse.
I had hope that this movie would be a good fall back to the 80's genre horror flicks and that is what it attempted to do, all be it very poorly.
1', in which he also stars, is a peculiar hybrid of the two genres that is consistently unpleasant without offering any compensation in the way of insight or laughs.
This is a sort of approach that is common for adventure movies but in this case they simple just overdid it.
There's nothing special within this film and as for hidden meanings, only those who think too hard might find 'a little something' that isn't there.
(eightx10)  Yes, that is also true.
Well, nothing i mean NOTHING happens till one and a half hour of the movie(what happens is the same old sightings of those zombies roaming in the house) and what all happens after that is silly (totally silly).
And that is essentially what the eighty some minutes of screen time boils down to--escaping the dogs.
After all, if you're truly fighting "The Man" (and not just making entertainment for Lefties), you'd better point a gun that is loaded with facts, not blanks.
WHY can't anyone just find an accent that is similar to the language they're supposed to talk????!
There is a scene in it that is shot from the perspective of the person being murdered and I mean it is aw inspiring!
He's specifically interested in a section of the desert that is reputed to have some real nutjobs roaming around looking for trouble (a few of whom hail from the local Marine Corps base).
There is no movie here - no plot, no story, no theme, no characters, no cinematography, no soundtrack - just boring shots of the desert inter cut with boring shots of awkward sex - until you finally and mercifully get an ending that is apparently from a different movie entirely.
Understated until it comes to the violence, that is.
But if you'd like to see a movie about the same subject in which the action sequences are actually exciting, something is said about war that is worth thinking about and the characters are well-played, go rent "The Dawn Patrol", made in 1938.
After the characters are introduced... funny stoner guy, hunky football guy, horny annoying chick, naive chick and the smart chick that is supposed to save the day... they stop for fuel and meet Sicko Stanley played by Crispin Glover.
He then emerges as the main gangster and lets loose on his up to then pent-up violence... that is, until the story reaches full circle and all three main characters are reunited.
It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen--boring, poorly written and acted, and woodenly directed--and that is saying something.
It is useless to tell about all that is wrong with it.
License To Kill (1989) is an inanely dismal installment to the Bond franchise that is best forgotten.
Colors are dated with overly pink flesh tones, weak contrast levels and a generally gritty digital that is distracting to say the least.
The only problem with that is the movie is so complicated and twisted that I lost interest in its story early on.
But that is about it, a few good quotes does not a good movie make and Double Take gives you the fealing of, "Heah, maybe I can throw a good idea (or a zillion) at you".
When it comes down to it the judges, and America, do not consider anything other than singing to be real talent, and that is a shame, because the variety is what could be the shows strongest feature.
It follows the same guidelines than "American Idol", you know, a host the three stereotypical judges, an obedient crowd for audience, and some entertaining contestants plus many more that are shown only for their humiliation on national TV, that is actually what most of the public seems to dig anyway.
No, they are not drinking any alcoholic liquor, but may be you'll need it to digest why this completely unknown -or at least very well forgotten- singer (that is how they introduced her) is the judge that completes the trilogy.
One star, and even that is being too generous!
This is an essential piece of the puzzle that is badly missing here; McGregor JUST HAPPENS to get a job where he meets Nolte.
"These bad boys with the black nipples are the Death Heads," the cut-price Castaneda points out, while the audience wonders just what the heck kind of accent that is.
A group of American teens take a trip to trip (on 'shrooms, that is).
The whole back story seems to be a relatively regurgatated camp fire tale that is used in most films "a bad house, kids are abused, one messed up kid left"- come on this just isn't scary.
The film has one redeeming feature, and that is the appearance of Don Wycherley and Sean McGinley as the two hicks.
There is only one performance that rises above the average and that is, not surprisingly, that of Sara Rue.
It's got real class that is timeless.
I think every married couple should see this movie if for nothing else than the conversation that is sure to ensue afterwards.
What made their performance so good was that is seemed so real.
The beginning truly captures the free and concept-expanding atmosphere that is the Esalen Institute, which itself has not changed much since then.
Screen goddess Natalie Wood, in one of her best roles, inhabits the honesty and sexual freedom that is Carol.
Tons of sexy full-frontal and soft-core sex, some good violent scenes (including a kung-fu battle with a nekkid chick that is off-the-hook...) and an extremely downbeat ending don't make this one the feel good film of the summer - unless you're like me and live for this sort of trash.
I don't know what it is about Almodovar's movies that is so arresting, so captivating.
The storyline is good, but it's the camerawork that is so beautiful.
There is one theme behind the story, which is brought forward in the conclusion of the movie, and that is the changing face of Spain over the last quarter of the twentieth century; but the connection of this idea to the plot is slight.
Alfonso Beato provides the film with a gorgeous cinematography and Alberto Iglesias, like always, comes with a score that is beautiful on its own, but also fitting the film in a perfect way.
This episode alone is better than any Twilight Zone series, and that is not easy to do.
If you like classic shows like The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, The Nightstalker, and others, and classic Horror, Crime, Thrillers, Dramas, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to go over to Amazon.com and buy this film that is also included with the complete first season on DVD today!
Finally, note the appearance (in his first movie role according to this board) of comedian Tom Poston as a police officer, who gets involved in a situation that is far from amusing.
So that is why you should watch this.
The frat-house shenanigans are tame beyond belief when compared to other Lampoon college movies, and the girl waiting for the perfect time to toss in her V-card is an old theme that isn't freshened in any way by this film.
Goldie Hawn has never been a favorite, I must admit, but that is all the more reason to catch her in the one performance where she is not quirky, superfluous or silly.
Suffice it to say, if you want a good example of how NOT to adapt a foreign film, that is the example to study.
A movie that is just as good today as it was almost 20 years ago.
The only entertainment value to be found as Varney mugs endlessly and destroys everything around him is in the hopelessly slack direction, which leads to such lapses in logic as a cannon rolling for miles along a completely straight road, a sequence that is topped only when the cannon bursts into a garden but leaves the fence behind it completely intact.
However, even this you can except a lot of "stupid" but some of that is part of Varney's charm as the lovable "Ernest P. Worrell," a man he made famous first with TV commercials and then with a handful of inane-but- Innocent comedies.
I wish there were a score lower than one.The cab ride to the airport is the worst part of the movie (that is spoiler alert.
You get to see a bunch of well - known German actors that tell a story that is foreseeable, but the good thing of the film isn't the story, it's how it's told.
Or we're handed a world that is set up in a very deliberate, expert manner, then expected to accept the fact that anything goes, no matter how ridiculous or silly the film unfolds after the halfway point, like in Event Horizon.
The setting is a big war in outer space between Earthlings and some aliens called the Kilrathi (more about them later), and most of the action we are chiefly concerned with takes place on a big spaceship that is something like an aircraft carrier.
There are no big name stars or SFX but that is made up for with bizarre plotting and storyline.
If you get a chance to catch a screening of it on the new 35mm that is, supposedly, circulating art-house cinemas around the U.S., go.
If you don't know who that is, look them up, "art noise" is a generous description.
And a fat lot of good that is!
In short, Leigh's gone back to basics here, tried to "do a Ken Loach" and produced a real gobbler that is not worth feeding to the dog on Boxing Day.
"All or Nothing" certainly isn't a movie for the masses and I'm sure that many people will never see it or even think about seeing it and that is a shame.
To some, it might appear like nothing really happens in them, but what I see in them is a reality that is like nothing else on film.
This film has none of the twists and turns you would expect from a thriller, an ending that is at once unconvincing, predictable, and weak, and plot holes you could drive a bus through.
As a side note, that is one hell of a recovery, both physically and mentally.
There's a feeling of coming full circle that is both excellent and slight depressing (despite what they've seen and done, Mulder and Scully haven't really gone anywhere).
I found it interesting how Marita Covarrubias refers to CSM as Cancer Man to Mulder, as if it's common knowledge that is what he should be called.
And for anyone who lived in Glasgow it's a great "Oh I know where that is" film.
But I'm afraid to say that is because I distinctly recall it as being the worst film I ever saw.
I can just name one thing that is more degrading, and that's starring in an adult movie...
This movie is worth 5 points at best, but from somebody who is trying to cope with the fact that his own girlfriend is an escort girl, and has learned so much that is both good and bad about a world he never knew, this was essential viewing for understanding what goes through her mind, and therefore gets a full 10.
As far as the set up of the film the consistencies were a little shaky, but I am sure that is a budget thing.
When the film was over there was silence in the room... What can you say about a film that is so thoroughly sickening and disturbing?
Foreboding, but not with that kind of constant tension that is so taxing about thrillers generally.
I mean, the story is impossible, but that is the magic of cinema...........isn't it?
This interesting film from Spanish director De la Iglesia is a road trip that is fun and action packed, as it is obscure.
De la Iglesia takes us on the roller-coaster that is this movie, as it never drags and goes on with a fast-paced rhythm.
Something that isn't too common for a '40's genre movie.
His recognisable voice is put to good use from the start with an eerie, atmospheric monologue, teamed with a picture that is gradually revealed to be a gigantic stalagmite, Goliath.
Having been enthralled by the magic that is "Casablanca" some years before, I had been seeking out other films like it made by Warner Bros. in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s.
(but that is a good movie anyway)  GO SEE IT!
I think that is some of the reason for the amazing performances, because of the colorful environment that they had to work in.
I enjoyed over the years watching this film for several reasons, first one the artwork that is featured in it, next is the music, another this could have been a good lead in for a television series(not the big reason, but part of it.
But nothing of that is in this film version.
It is the visual that is hilarious.
When the parents and younger brothers and sisters (I think) walked into the one bedroom, THAT THE BOYS WERE SHARING; I and everyone in the theater were laughing so hard, one could not hear the dialog; that is, if the actors were even talking.
There is no plot in the film, just two people lost in the wildness - and that is exactly about all.
The actors are very talented and do what they can with the material, but not even talented actors can save a script that is as empty, dry, and desolate as the grand canyon itself.
The less said the better, not because its bad, rather because its the sort of film that is best left to its own devices.
its not music that is "in".
rather, its music that is really hardcore and i just love it.
I mean were can you find a show that is funny and has demons).
If you get a chance, watch it, it is the rare network show that is funny without resorting to being dumb.
So this movie makes one feel strongly close to the characters, part of a growth process that is basically the same for boys and girls on this planet, despite generations, social conditions, culture or intellect.
I love bad horror movies the crappier the better so that is why i love this movie.
Gable and Lombard eventuated in a shrewd, mediocre film that is not worth the time that it takes in dragging the viewer through the unbearable misrepresentations of various figures of Hollywood's classic period.
And that is a rare commodity these days.
I will, however, elaborate as much as I can on all the things that "Across 110th" does represent Â and that is quite a lot!
Aside from the 'The Battleship Potemkin (1925),' a prerequisite for any budding film buff, I'd previously only seen his debut effort 'Glumov's Diary (1923),' a brief and plot-less short that is rather difficult to come by.
Like I said, there is a lot that is funny, and a whole lot that is sad, but isn't that the way relationships are?
Its biggest coup Â that is, apart from the rigorous yet effective compression of the source material (thanks to extremely fast transitions between one scene and the next, characterized by admirably mobile tracking shots!
This is an interesting historical relic that is reflective of the era that it came out of.
Garrity, Harrigan, and Mullivan (Jimmy, Harry, and Al Ritz) discover that is really heiress Norma Denby (Anita Louise) who may be the target of the killer.
But all that is ruined, utterly and completely by the genre silliness.
In a world where City of God does not existed City of Men would shine brighter, unfortunately for this film that is not the case, it is a constant reminder of a superior film.
It seemed more like a war zone than a city, but that is a fact of life for the millions who live there.
The Titanic will always have something to teach us, and that is important.
The revelation who the "Iceman" is, that is the only real surprise in this movie, the rest is real predictable.
So all in all, not a classic yet highly entertaining, and that is what it was supposed to do.
They appear happy together, that is, until Nancy Potter, a neighbor, interests her in astronomy.
That's one of the great things about CRASH: that is a film that shows both corruption of the decent and the unexpected decency lying within the corrupt.
Though The Apostle is a work of fiction, it does a great job of presenting faith that is shunned by the world and continuously proved by God.
It's not often I get to see a movie that isn't 1) unbelievably complicated in psychological meaning OR 2) unbelievably complicated in futuristic technology SO  I found it GREAT ENTERTAINMENT, REFRESHING, POSITIVE, AND most of all CLEAN, HEALTHY FUN!
I love sci/fi films from the awesomeness that is Serenity and Alien to turkey's like the astronauts wife and Invasion.
In the third act however--that is, after Brutus and Cassius have fled Rome--he seems to grow in the part and his acting gains conviction.
You pull for them to live happily ever after and frankly that is what a good romantic drama should do.
It turns out that Henry has a genetic defect that is the cause of his time travel.
The young actors in this film are much more impressive than young actors often are (this is the kind of actor that is most likely to be forgiven for a bad performance because they're so darn cute), each portraying wonderfully the characters as they are presented in the novel.
This is one of the only things that is fortunately subdued a little bit, since in the book the robin goes through a mating period and there is actually one chapter late in the novel where the robin and his mate have a conversation about Dickon and his strange friends, whom they're not too sure about.
The shot where Mary looks longingly out of the window is stolen from Sophie Anderson's "No Walk Today" and that is not meant as a criticism.
It would take a colder heart than mine to turn aside from the redemption through innocence proposition that is at the centre of "The Secret Garden"
Well all I have to say to that is "GET OVER IT"!
everyone knows about zombies, i mean seriously its not that hard to figure out that is plastering it in the chest with bullits does not stop it shot it in the bloody brain.
This Movie Was Terrible to put it in 1 word.....  3 out of ten is actually quite good for this movie.....  With its complicated in depth story which never makes sense anywhere through the film to the characters terrible performance which lacks emotion within them, really makes me ashamed to say I am a fan of the game.This film doesn't have a hero to be straight,i am actually by the end glad there all being killed of because you honestly don't really care and have no reason to care what happens to them, if your still watching it by that time that is.
Paul W. S. Anderson has proved that he is terrific writer & director because it is extremely difficult to create a story for a film that is based on a video game.
It had a lot of style and the use of advanced modern technology that is mostly I look for in a film, the Licker in the end was the icing on the cake.
Nudity is hardly unknown in the 'dirty old man's' films but were this not so different in feel to accepted hardcore, that is the label one might find appropriate.
So the whole time the girl is talking to Jacobs, you only see the side/back of her head via this wacky low-angle shot that is dominated by a couch...the bottom part of the couch.
While derivative of RISKY BUSINESS and rougher, more recent fare from Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, this movie has a touch that is all its own.
However, it is a woman named Helen Hayes(played by the beautiful Marie Prevost) that is the undoing of Scarsi, whom refers to women as "poison" several time throughout the film.
Well, that is a crying shame!
Other then that there is nothing else that is worth a chuckle.
I mean, in earnest, it isn't even the level of humor that is the problem, but rather the monotony of it all.
Please, for your own good, heed my warning and do not waste an hour and 20 minutes of your life on something that is not, even in its most glorified form, entertaining or funny.
The Plot Basically goes like this: The dumb witted Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris) has taken up a job as a house caretaker for a old lady that is said to be cursed.
At first I thought it would be bad acting because that is the case with a lot of soaps.
The only thing, only thing i don't like about this show is that it takes a mighty long time for the truth to come out or for something to happen, but i think that is what makes it a good show.
He stops at a crime scene that is particularly seedy.
Other great true this film shows is the sad side that everybody has ;when you know you can do what you want with somebody ,you do it...This means that you make suffer that person (that has fall in love with you), only for pleasure...that is how the mankind is.
It is this premise that is actually used as a platform of greater things, something that allows a certain fascination in third parties initially unaware, but also gets across a certain sense of well-being.
A memory film that is quite forgettable.
There's something wholesome that is ripped apart in the story here, and it's at its core a tale of passionate love and desire that becomes like a mind-game.
This question would be the shallow one; Polanski's achievement here is expressing a savage bond that is like a slow-working poison, ready to affect anyone that grows closer to their very human tragedy.
There is no more warm and loving family or friend interaction for the sake of it, and that is the glue that holds the show together.
Douglas inherited his father's crummy B picture studio and made it Big in Hollywood terms -- that is, big in quality, big in gross.
Fred recommends to Johnathan, that the two do a picture that is at first deemed impossible.
The cartoon was a pretty action packed, the dialog at times was corny and as the show progressed it got weaker, but that is really a lot of cartoon shows at the time.
It took so long for Herc to finally get off that island!
In fact, Herc was on that island for 40 minutes, long for an 1 1/2 hour movie.
What more could you ask for than a handsome thief, two gorgeous women, a wimp of an FBI man, a bully of British cop, a super black Mercedes Coupe, a vintage motor cycle, gambling, a murder, bumbling Gestapo thugs and supporting actors that truly support the play that is in progress!
My hope is that I can find a station that is willing to show this movie again.
The 6.7 rating is ridiculous, but that is with little over 100 voters.
I seem to want to use words like quaint, nice and warm to describe this film but feel that is doing it an injustice as the ladies of the Womans Institute do have a battle to achieve their goal and the love lives and complications of family all add up to a very good story well told against a wonderful backdrop.
That may sound ridiculous but the PBS News Hour and occasionally CNN do it regularly when Iraqis or Pakistanis or Afghans, for example, are being interviewed in English that is hard for viewers to understand.
They are very British and yes that is a compliment.
The result is a coherent progression that is more interested in human beings than plot details.
I'd recommend this to anyone who's interested in a movie that is both hysterically funny and deeply touching.
The film has the feel of two different editors and in fact that is what happened.
Don't believe everything that is in a political movie as fact.
As a parent forced to endure a fair amount of kids entertainment, it is always a relief to find something that is at least tolerable to an adult.
We may never be near a volcano that is threatening to erupt, but we read about such eruptions each year and this film helps to give us a better understanding of what one is really like.
The show has comic relief that is classic Tony Shaloub schtick!
...and I think part of the reason for that is, aside from some notable uses of symbolism (some subtle, some not so subtle, in part due to the photography), the story is rather simple.
The three key actors of the film, Andersson, Von Sydow, and Gould, seem to live in these characters, and especially Gould (for whom this would be his only role with the director) conveys a sort of double nature that is also within Karin.
Josie is physically beautiful, but that is her main problem.
The cinematography is pretentious with the DP constantly attempting to do something with film that is far beyond his reach.
It's a truly artistic expression in film that is metaphysical, existential, and flat out brilliant.
I'm not sure what that is all about, or why Dracula, in an attempt to get to his coffin to escape the rays of the sun, just didn't turn into a bat and fly (can you say..."no budget.")
I'm not sure how many words the IMDb allows viewers to prattle on in their reviews, but whatever that word limit is, it is not enough by 1/10th to adequately describe the awfulness that is Al Adamson's "Dracula vs.
Yeah, the budgets were tiny, the productions were unpolished, and the stories were ridiculous; nonetheless, all involved took the films very seriously, and produced something that is still being enjoyed 35 years later.
Zandor Vorkov looks ridiculous in his afro, goatee, and white greasepaint, but he gives a unique and interesting performance as Count Dracula, and one that is not to be ashamed of.
The acting is flawless... and believe me, that is not a term I use lightly.
As a principle Turkish food can be presented with a taste that is somewhat unedible.
This is a mystery that is solved in the end, but it's not a simple explanation; even though the motives and means for Mike's murder are revealed, nothing is really settled; only more, deeper questions on top of questions emerge.
Susan Sarandon, Jason Patric, James Franco (in a tiny but pivotal role), Josh Brolin, Frances Fisher (in a cameo that is very impressive), and all the young men who play the soldiers involved in the investigation are superb.
This is a movie about, not the U.S. Army, but the Hollywood Army; that is, the Army as Hollywood has seen it since the 60's.
Charlize Theron and Susan Sarandon with a solid cast bring home the horror of Iraq in a film that is today's war in the Middle East.
The part of this film that is the Star and center piece is Paul Hagas's script.
'War is hell' but perhaps it is the postwar that is most telling.
At least that is the thesis of Paul Haggis' latest film, In the Valley of Elah, a story of a father's quest for his son that reveals some bitter truths about war.
I think he's very smart here; he has no political point of view, he handles Charlize Theron perfectly, and the movie forces everybody to think about the troops in a way that isn't simply political rhetoric.
While there is a very interesting texture to the film, that is, cell phone movies are used to move the plot forward, and what we see is not quite clear so we want to find out more, just like the characters in the action, Haggis chose to withhold crucial information from the audience until the end of film.
This show is a wonderful oasis in the wasteland that is television today.
Susan Sarandon is not, as some critic said, "underused"; she gives a performance that is all the more powerful because it is restrained.
Perhaps its the Japanese concept of people being pulled along by the tides of life, rather than actors in our own destinies that is the real theme of this and his other movies.
The girl that is raped is perhaps only person in the film who would not hurt anyone and is like angel here.
Later, you'll find that Sante and Kenny Kimes have done more gifting and murder across the United States than of this Irene Silverman episode and that is what makes the thought of them more chilling than portrayed.
No mention is made of the incredible pennant race between the Detroit Tigers and the The New York Yankees, a critical piece of information that is essential to better appreciating the circumstances surrounding the quest to break Ruth's record.
Also a relief pitcher, Luis Arroyo of the New York Yankees, had 15 WINS in addition to 29 saves, an incredible performance that is all but forgotten yet actually happened.
Don't be afraid to watch it with any kid that is smart enough to get it.
The other, smaller potion of this film that is almost soul stirring is the brilliant editing of MgWire's 61 and 62 home runs to open and close the movie.
It is nothing less than a love story to two men and a team that is truly legendary in a sport where the term "legend" is too easily used.
There might be a sequel to this show too, titled "Vallavan" that is coming out in theatres this year.
How does a pretty smart guy lose contact to the "Reality", whatever that is meant?
There is a beauty to this film that is so subtle and so brilliant that you have to be a good viewer to understand it.
If we take this film like all films by Hitchcock should be taken, that is to say as a metaphor of real life, of history, of fate, then we might be less surprised by the date.
But that is to no avail because life is stronger than illusions and death is even stronger than life.
There seems to be little left in life if that is the case.
Second, in all good fiction, always tell the "truth"; that is to say, the story must be believable.
Harry could just as well be anything, but the only thing that is of concern is, of course, that he's dead.
So all of this, done in a manner that should suggest reality but doesn't in the slightest, builds up to something that is like the other side of the morbid coin that one saw in Strangers on a Train.
Instead, this is a film that is fun to watch, and provides laughs at the most unexpected places.
Donald OConnor, Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Danny Kaye all had desire that is lacking in movies now.
How much of that is related to the mis-marketing and an under appreciation of the soundtrack?
yes it's educational at how christians react to abortion, but surely this is extremism that isn't even enjoyable.
Okay, some rehashing of old stories can sometimes be good, but that is where the actors really need to shine and make you fall in love with them like I did in The Princess Diaries.
Having seen the first movie you would know that Paige or Eddie would find themselves being manipulated by someone that is so obvious.
I like most any movie made that is a comedy love story or a sappy love story.
A movie that is supposed to be inspirational, challenging , interacting and about making new friends turns into a flick about glorifying mentally warped individuals.
There's a raw, leave-nothing-to-the-imagination sex scene between Graham and a certain character (trying not to divulge any serious spoilers here) that is not only surprising (given how, when Graham shot it, there were very high hopes for her ABC sitcom and for her becoming a network prime time queen), but cathartic and wholly satisfying in terms of character arc.
Paco Plaza has crafted a truly special film that is unfortunately hampered with a dreadful direct to video title but you should get past that and give this one a shot.
It's a face that is unique to that person, one that you will never get to know probably, but when you take a glance of in the subway or the bus or the sidewalk, you know somehow you relate to them, somehow you know there's a story behind them.
A "truer" actress playing Ana (that is, not quite so fetching and physically perfect) would have made it less annoying.
Element after element, plot event after event set the tone for a story that is being told.
Joe was obviously hoping for another big chart-topper like "You Light Up My Life", but its inexplicable success was not to be matched by the cringe-inducing dirge that is this film's theme song.
You also get an inside view of the music jingle industry and that is a riot.
She has a vivacity that shows through and that is refreshing to see.
But rather intriguingly, Seinfeld has pulled off quite the animated picture, albeit one that is distinctively Seinfeldian.
it was slapped on together to make a movie that is so corny and has no sense whatsoever.
When he travels into the world outside the hive,he is awed by the larger,mostly human-dominated world,but later comes to realize that the very product he and his fellow bees make(take a wild guess what that is)is being exploited by humans for large profit.
I suppose one,going into or(eventually)renting this film has to approach this as a hybrid curiosity of a film:a film for the whole family that is going to be understood and appreciated at different levels for each member(assuming its appreciated at all).
If you recognize that that is what the filmmakers are going for, then you will enjoy it.
He gets more than he asks for and that is what makes the movie great.
This film has no comparison to the very special "The Illusionist" but that is a very good thing.
Thus begins a road trip that is highly dramatic with its share of comic events.
This just might e the smartest black comedy (that is a matter of opinion ever made) right up there with Reoir's The Rules of the Game.
I am not comparing this series to the old professionals as I don't think that is fair.
That this film has won some minor awards is testament only to political correctness - and the kind of political correctness that is merely a fashion.
To me he seemed to be acting; perhaps he was thinking about his acceptance speech for the Czech One World Film Festival - whatever that is).
The act is horrible, but that is mainly due to stupid script and bad direction.
But like I said, the whole objective is seeking out and defeating these sixteen colossi, and that is where the true fun begins.
It's true that most of the people featured were Caucasian and probably middle-upper class - but if that is who is doing the puzzles and going to the tournament, you can hardly fault the film makers.
Mike Mussina, Bill Clinton and Jon Stewart are all thrown in to show that all walks of life are addicted and not everyone that is addicted looks like the reclusive nerd we all knew in high school.
There is one scene with an element of sportsmanship that is rarely displayed in competition on any level.
It's a robust package for a niche-oriented film but one that is more entertaining than it has any right to be.
Wordplay is a small independent that is more worthy of an Academy Award than many of the "big ticket" movies out there.
The VHS cover's a laugh though, it says that is was too gory for TV, that's why it went straight to video-- yeah, try to prop up that fragile ego of your's Mr. Filmmaker.
I think that is all you need to know.
While it succeeds in this to an extent that is almost groundbreaking, the film will divide audiences equally.
Then we have (after equally impressive editing by Nils Pagh Andersen) a lengthy work that is asking you to spend the best part of a day to watch it.
The 2 women left standing I suppose believe the other person is the murderer so Britt Ekland ends up killing her and that is the end of her story.
Next we fast-forward two weeks and Vargas is seen boarding an abandoned-looking boat that is adrift in the middle of the sea.
There's a dark intensity about the movie that can hook one in but there's no denying this is not a pleasant film to watch and for those who like a bit of sweet escapism to their films, they should run like the wind if they put this on, because that isn't what their going to get.
I guess that is why I like ratings by actual viewers!
Men, that is how you get your woman to say "YES!")
And that isn't the fault of either of the Cassavetes men, the dad John who wrote the script or the son Nick who retrieved it after his father's death.
There is another side to seeing a movie that is unbearably emotional or depressing.
And that is learning what it is that makes it so for the viewer.
The point being, a movie that is so affecting might have something to teach me.
Maybe it is the entry into a very real world that isn't so extreme or unusual--though we are shown an especially awful and pivotal moment in that world--a milieu present in every small city, and common in a big one.
You want a movie about an irredeemable person that is worth seeing?
All in all, he cooks roasts about as well as he opens doors, that is, not without considerable practice.
One of the elements that is actually kind of amusing in a horrible way is that you have absolutely NO chance against the evil forces in this movie, to the point where it is ludicrous.
You might just be trying to avoid torture, so confession doesn't officially count until you've been tortured for days-that is, if you don't die under torture ("Not another one!"
There is a sequence featuring a bicycle pump, knitting needles, a man and a woman in bed making love in a bed with squeaky springs, that is just incredibly entertaining.
Despite being a very dark subject, this cannibal fantasy is actually quite funny and charming (that is, apart from when they are hacking the unsuspected into cutlets).
It was very hard for me when I found myself in front of Miro's painting that is called "Sin titulo" (no name).
One thing that is really exceptional in the movie is the amazing (and weiiird) soundtrack, and the unique musical scene that happens with everything that can probably create a sound, or noise, in the context... A MUST SEE!!!!
I am a huge fan of any movie (or thing) that is off-centre, and not-quite-right.
Delicatessen is set in a weird, post-apocalyptic, alternate universe that is not entirely dissimilar to the setting of Terry Gilliam's Brazil (1985)--in fact, this could very easily be the same world as Brazil, just that that film is situated in its titular locale, and this would be a less fashionable section of France.
In fact, the only film I can think of that is similar to this is Terry Gilliam's futuristic fantasy; Brazil.
(that is set off when the butcher tells it that "life is wonderful", no less).
The way that the film looks is also wonderfully different; Delicatessen has a yellow hue, which lends it a style that is very dull and dreary; and that does the film no end of favours when you consider it's core subject material.
This is nice, as during the scenes between the clown (Pinon) and Julie (Dougnac), the film allows itself to indulge in humour that isn't dark like the rest of the film, and you get the impression that it's enjoying itself a little more.
They are usually scarier and more honest than the teen-angst goof fests (Final Destination, I Know What...) Watching this 80 minute film, I was ready to forgive many flaws but what I got was the bad acting, non-stop handheld video, boring crap that is dooming most new horror flicks.
And that is exactly what Warlords Of Atlantis is.
Next of Kin is a much better film and perhaps a big part of that is the strong cast of future stars Next of Kin carries.
Well that is what they did plus help in finding and killing the people responsible for killing Truman's brother.
While Joey Rosellini insults the mountain folks as people "who farm rocks" his boss John Isabella sees the link -- "that is what they said about our people back in the old country."
Then there are some shoot outs and a betrayal subplot and somehow the comedy gets lost and you just have a Mafia movie that is not really that good.
The sets are nicely done, and that is literally the single enjoyable aspect of this entire production.
Even by Takashi Miike's standards, Visitor Q is one hell of a weird ride, and is undoubtedly the director's most outrageous work to date (and considering this is the same guy who gave us Ichi the Killer, Gozu and Audition, that is really saying something!).
My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under.
So behind the shock value and the constant disturbing images thrown at the spectators, there lies a deep analysis of human drives that is quite revealing and to the point.
There is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting, but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses.
He bears his soul with a project like "Visitor Q" and that is rare and brave.
and that is the point.
Now that is a sign of a fine romance and an excellent relationship.
When she dies at the age of 47 (47 for goodness sake) she left behind a legacy of entertainment that is unmatched by anyone over such a relatively short time.
In a not so well-known piece of the maker of the singing detective, the group of children that is portrayed slowly yet steadily degress from just a bunch of playful kids into a sadistic bloodthirsty mob.
The camera quality is very poor, but this is a low budget movie so that is be expected.
In happiness, that is.
The only thing that I can think of that is a negative point for this movie is that after you watch this, Comedy is RUINED...because NOTHING is funny after you watch this.
This movie is so hilarious I can not even put it down on the comment box, that is just how insanely funny this movie is.
'My cousin Vinny' delivers on all accounts, successfully taking what is perceived to be a serious and somewhat complicated situation and subject area, and turning it into something that is farcical- yet entertaining.
I know the exact line that is coming and I chuckle every time.
One thing that is accurately captured is the fish-out-of-water experience of a city lawyer when subjected to trying a case in a far-flung rural county.
(If I have to watch more than half-way through a movie to get past the part that is an utter waste, it's too far gone to redeem itself for me.)
It's a little like L&H agreed to impersonate themselves, and if you don't mind that for 75 minutes, the movie is a good 7 out of 10: that is, a pleasant and better-than-average diversion for a Sunday afternoon.
The movie ends with quite a big battle sequences that is well fitted into the movie and makes sure that the movie ends with a blast.
The manner in which these adults talk with Anna is short-lived, because as soon as she dons a uniform and becomes part of the strict and religious system (that is her school) she is no longer that free-thinking individual.
but when her dad tells her that is being a sheep, she asks how he knows that what he is doing is solidarity, not just being a sheep.
But if you want a movie that is intelligent, funny and have characters you care for, see "The Brothers Bloom".
There is little to say about The Brothers Bloom that isn't already apparent or expected.
The characters are puppets whose master, Rian Johnson, has positioned them to do whatever it is that is most clever and elaborate to do, the fleshing out process relegated to secondary station.
I hope she finds her way into more movies that is accessible in the west.
He's a director that isn't going away, and to me this is a good thing.
Getting herself out of situations that the brothers can't even fathom and catching on to things so quickly, it's as though the mark becomes the professional, however, that is exactly Stephen's plan.
It combines my love of humor, hockey and music in a tale of romance and transformation that is smart, rather than sickly sweet.
To this day I haven't seen anything, even the legendary films of Ed Wood, that is as bad as this film.
The old man, to protect the girl, wards the men off with his bow, a weapon that is also used as a kind of hypnotic musical instrument (based on the Er-hu) many times throughout the film.
Bizarre film, to say the least, but it did offer us the collective term for everything in cult, horror and trash cinema that is unique and indescribable.
The moment when the girl was rejecting the old man's hand at night is the moment when the ego is alone, separate from his soul, in a dark night of suffering that is necessary for it to understand his mistakes.
The old man's attempt to stop the girl leaving by sacrificing his life is the sacrifice of the ego that is necessary for the soul to become free.
But much worst is the directing style that is terribly boring.
The film has a grittiness that is entirely appropriate.
This film is a Great movie with real good plot that is continuous and keeps you involved.
The Flyboys is definitely the best adventure movie I have scene ever, and that is coming from a film major who sees movies all the time.
Soon, Jason and Kyle unexpectedly get on board a plane that is carrying a bomb.
Quite possibly the best thing about the film is a theme that is so catchy with Amadio using it at every opportunity.
Not much from him that is that interesting, although you could feel sad for the kid, as early on in the movie Pan collapses onto the floor and is taken to a hospital where of course, they can't do much for her.
Come one man you can do better than this ,i used to like your movies until now that is .
However, her niece Amy (Jessica Amlee) that is afraid of "dark things" behind the walls of the house asks her to stay in the town for a couple of days and Christy's friend Debbie (Nicole Anderson) welcomes and lodger her in her house.
However, allow me to still add that that if you are looking for a movie along this theme and want one that is *really* well done, watch "A Tale of Two Sisters."
It is this relaxed sexual freedom that is more the moral center of this movie rather than the sex itself.
Brougher has courage to address an issue most people wish to submerge - that of unwanted teenage pregnancies and their consequences - and she does it in the form of a story that is so well woven and presented with such fine actors that she not only succeeds in bringing attention to her main topic, she also introduces us to two women whose lives, though separated by years of age, are significantly parallel.
How these two women reach the conclusions they do is the part of the story that is best left unshared until the viewer experiences it alone.
There is a small role for fine character actress Novella Nelson as Doctor Lynn that is a remarkable achievement.
She concludes, when asked, that is suggests, "it is harder to live a lie than it is to tell the truth and be punished."
When Tomme goes into the "white man civilization," there is evil: drinkers, rape, abuse to the native Indians, and all the unfairness that is common to the natives around the world.
Matt Newton also does very well as the main character who's life bears the brunt of the bet that is referred to in the title.
The casting is wonderful and Matt Newton manages to pull off a character that is believable, likable, trapped, in love and great looking all in the space of 90 minutes.
The original music is symphonic and deftly enhances the emotion of each moment in a way that is sometimes lacking in modern Australian cinema.
He shows us a picture of his family that is loving but not saccharine.
Ultimately it paints a portrait of a family with all it's facets that is a real gem.
There are a few slow points in the film, but that is not enough to disregard it.
But all that isn't important if it's funny and entertaining, but it isn't.
I said The Fantastic Four was more entertaining, and it is (The unreleased Corman movie that is).
L'Immoralita is a film that is difficult to pigeon hole into one 'type' of film, but suffice to say it's an entertaining and well worked thriller with enough substance to satisfy most viewers, providing they can stomach the sometimes uncomfortable tone of the movie.
The murderer and the child grow closer together despite the law being after him and the pair develops a friendship that is shattered when the mother discovers the sheltered criminal.
It all boils down to a typically shocking conclusion and while this film definitely won't float everybody's boat, it is a very interesting thriller one that is definitely worth seeing.
This movie provides a sympathetic portrait of a lifestyle that is the true orientation for many people.
Now it wasn't a bad film, but more like a film by a great director that is only very good.
Gary Cooper is a particular revelation, displaying a flair for comedy that is quite unexpected.
All that is, of course, completely irrelevant; the question is not whether the play is faithful to the source material, but whether it's good.
Another idiotic thing that is often said about "Design For Living" is that Lubitsch and Hecht rewrote Coward due to fear of the censors.
But there's something else here that isn't found in most Lubitsch films, and it comes from Ben Hecht, whose cynical, fast-talking, very American style of writing gives the characters a flavor quite unlike the more Continental wit of Lubitsch's usual heroes.
Lacking any explained or implied purpose or intent, three villains decide to come to town in a fashion that is strangely plagiarized (and far better executed) by the original High Noon.
This could seem outdated and escapistic, but it fits a story that is itself of silent beauty, happening on the border between life and fairy tale, between Dian Fossey and Le Petit Prince.
For some reason, the two soldiers never fully recover and they go on a rampage that is tame by cannibal standards.
These films, Cannibal Apocalypse being a very noteworthy example, are nothing but exploitation and attempts to cash in some bucks and throw a movie that is even more violent and sleazy than the previous one.
The Italian cannibal/zombie genre has some real masterpieces and serious pieces like Ruggero Deodato's harrowing 1979 masterpiece Cannibal Holocaust that is as important and topical in its message about humanity and media than it was back then.
Naturally the film caused a hystery due to its sadistic and graphic (but not gratuitous) violence and many producers and directors started to rip that film off in order to "satisfy" the audience that liked the violence in Deodato's film so much even though that is definitely not even the film's point, it is its theme, and everyone watching Holocaust because of its violence are closer to the film's message than they could have ever (dared to) thought.
The film has sadly very few positive cinematic merits and even the soundtrack that is usually very effective in these films (Fabio Frizzi with Fulci and Riz Ortolani with Deodato) is at times very awful and almost laughably cheesy disco-something attempt that makes the imagery even more painful to follow.
But the soundtrack has some genuinely creepy bits too and that is more than nice.
It seems that since that is all they had to eat at times, they were somehow "infected" with a need to continue with this bad habit.
Cannibal Apocalypse(U.S. title) is the only Margheriti film that is ultra-violent.
All though this doesn't affect Norman the only non hospitalized Vietnam veteran who was bitten by Tony King (Note that is the guys real name)and how their urges of hunger come to matter (cannibalsim), and yes we can all say "We know what they are feeling."
From "Cannibal Holocaust", to Dawn of the Dead, this is a hybrid-film that is unique to the time that made it.
A cannibal-virus, that is.
It involves a satanic cult that is posing as a Christian church and has chosen a child to 'become the devil' upon her eighteenth birthday.
I still believe the film was good and I understand for the most part that is really what happens but Boorman could have made the film a bit more interesting and different and still portray his message.
A fantastic murder-mystery-comedy-musical-combination that is truly fun!
THis is just a fun little show from the 80's that is just meant to be enjoyed.
So, while that is going on, Jake gets with Keri, meets his brother, Billy (Matthew Barry), etc.
The Wraith starts late one night deep in the Arizona desert as what looks like several balls of electricity fly along just above the ground eventually they merge together & form a futuristic black car & a shadowy mysterious figure that is the wraith.
This is definitely a thought-provoking movie, but one that is not too heavy handed.
A mysterious spirit that is somehow connected to the new car.
Packard soon realizes that there is something strange going on, something that is perhaps connected to him..to something that he and his gang did..perhaps even connected to that new guy in town, Jake.
The acting is pantomimish (baddies=very bad, goodies=very good) but that is the style of this movie.
Altogether, about as good as you can expect from something that is not intended to be a documentary.
If you do compare this to other low budget zombie movies out there (Braindead or Dead And Breakfast to name two), it doesn't even begin to compare and ends up looking like a High School students weekend project that is paid for with his allowance.
For years, I've bemoaned the switch from film to digital video for low-budget horror movies, but I'd rather watch anything shot on video than watching the waste of film that is Dead Life.
But the thing that is way beyond compare in this picture is the bubbling beauty of Lana Turner at her absolute peak.
There is a feeling of dread throughout the film that is well maintained, and that's a big plus.
It could be a bit storytelling at times, but that is needed for younger viewers.
Then, in a society that is 200 years away from Women's Suffrage, she expects...
This is a movie that is great for a family.
The problem lies mostly in the plot that is often flat and predictable ruining many of the film's twists before they are even set up.
The result is a movie that is both sterile and stupid.
And I think that is the case here.
The Haunted Mansion is a lame children's film that is short on laughs and a good story.
The storyline is a mess, but that is not the point, this movie doesn't offer a message like "the good one wins", "the girl married the nice guy".
Her mother Suzan 'Sue' Berlin (Barbara Barrie) is a bitter school teacher that likes to flirt with the principal Arthur Gold (Bob Dishy), who is married with the housewife Alice Gold (Madeline Kahn) that is close to a breakdown.
A common misconception that people who havent seen these movies have is that all of these films go to gether as a mini-series- that is not true.
The main character dies and that is a rather suprise ending.
The film centers around Anthony, AKA "Blest", who is part of a "bombing" crew that is constantly hunted by the local Police Vandalism Unit.
This film is the best graf film ever made that isn't a documentary.
In that case, the subtleties are important: the richnesses of character aren't there to define a person, instead to indicate a world, many worlds as candidates for the one world that is true.
The closest thing to that is found to be a coincidence and even upsets the main character when he realizes what was in his soup.
Anyway, Dante is obsessed with his ex-girlfriend that cheated on him and he has a present girlfriend that is wonderful to him.
And that is all you need to know about the plot.
And we all know that is an absolute no no in relationships.
And she explains that when she "does it" it means more than when she goes down and that is supposed to make him feel better.
And that is just one of the scenes that makes the film work.
Why claim ultra-budget movies as being the "best film ever" when you can see some guys with almost no scenary and a very low budget make a great movie that is intelligent, funny, has a good soundtrack AND is well done at the same time?
This is a human condition that is rampant in modern society and it effects all of us to some extent - the need to keep up appearances with our peers (in a material sense) or else believe ourselves to be unloved, useless failures.
The millionaire with no friends (real that is) or the toilet attendant with many?
What follows is a comedy of mishaps, misunderstandings and odd coincidences that is very entertaining.
This is a two DVD set that is superb quality and crystal clear.
A one-man show that is both touching and very, very funny.
It also reveals the internal strife that is the labor movement and the beauty and weakness of the democratic process.
A monster that is about as lame as Ed Wood's giant octopus from "Bride of the Monster."
And there's a mysterious man who seems to preside over all that is weird there, presumably, Satan.
A thought that is quite depressing.
The capturing of Lennons early years was a masterpiece, in fact the actor should have gotten some kind of award, that is how Lennon was, a very talented rebel, who helped change the world, and would perhaps have made it a lot better place if that lunatic had not killed him.
The thing that is formed looks like a giant stick, or a really, really amateurish looking sword.
He is never satisfied but that is some of the humor as well.
As for Ffolkes' nemesis Kramer, Anthony Perkins shouts and waves his pistol with his sinister, steely-eyed glare that is enhanced by his lean, ascetic features and dark, close-cropped hair.
Mason's Admiral Sir Francis Brindsen is a stalwart, career naval officer whose contempt for Ffolkes and the man's unconventional methods is matched only by his deep, abiding mistrust of anything that is neither military nor naval.
This is cinema that is authentically and movingly human.
Not that film festivals aren't wonderful, but a much larger group of people deserve to see the wonderful human confusion that is Dirt.
I guess the only thing I can fault with this film is how predictable it is as I knew exactly how it would pan out just from watching the trailer and that is exactly what happened.
By the time anything that is supposed to pass for scary happened I was so bored I didn't care who lived or died.
(The director), the cast, and Mr. Spielberg for giving us something that isn't entirely predictable like most of the teen horror/thrillers are today.
What makes this movie better than most horror movies that are released today is that is doesn't rely on excessive gore and gross out tactics to frighten you.
I suggest you check it out if you liked Kevin's other work or even if you haven't, this one is probably the one that is most unlike his others.
Despite this, 'Mallrats' is a great film that is really, really funny.
There is a minor flaw with the screenplay and that is it looks like it`s going to turn into poor old Aldrich only became a traitor because he wanted to give his family the best out of life , but it doesn`t really turn into an excuse , so why do we have to learn about his sick mother in law and his wife wanting to go to university and getting final demands left right and centre ?
All I can say about this movie is WTF the concept is the same as your Blair Witch,Paranormal Activity and so on but somewhere between the halfway point of the movie its almost as the director lost all his sense of thinking and drops a twist which makes you go huh,and then about another 45 minutes or so later when you see the ending credits that is when you will have the reaction WHAT THE F***.
Or is the ferry simply a way to experience the same space over and over again - a "sameness" - that is in fact "different" every time (every time he rides the ferry there are new people, and he sits in a different place, etc.
The clues are pieced together from new footage of the girl which keeps surfacing, the deceased girl even buried evidence that is later unearthed.
Joan Crowford plays a prostitute that is accused for her behavior by Puritans in some lost Hawaiian island.
It does not have a definite resolution, though, so anyone who cannot stand that is already warned.
But, that is not the case in La Moustache.
The story perfectly sets up an uneasy atmosphere that is dark and sober.
The children do a very decent job of portraying children ( something that is increasingly rare these days) and Dirk Bogarde does a fantastic job of portraying their scumbag father.
I think that is what harmed this film the most Â but then I gave up on my plight to avoid cheap horror films and decided to watch the equally low-budget horror/suspense/thriller film "The Attic Expeditions", and I must admit, I was rejuvenated.
While there were some shots of a boom in some scenes, but again, that is what makes this low-budget film even better.
It means that someone will take a small budget, second rate actors and a horribly written script and make a movie that is a miasma of looks and scenes that confuse you.
I'd prefer longer scripts and films that run at least 80 to 90 minutes long.... For the 1940s, that is a normal run......
The mystery itself is well plotted and plays out in a way that is both exciting and full of tension.
These scenes are still available on the old Video Treasures VHS release that is available used.
There is so much footage taken from other movies, I'm pretty sure that the only original shots are those with the actors in the movie-and even that is doubtful.
Meanwhile, a police detective who has sleeping problems has a reoccurring nightmare that is bothering him on the job, and is forced to see a shrink.
This is the first documentary that is fair to Islam and the Muslims.
It is strongly recommended for anyone who lives in the West, particularly in the USA, and is skeptical of the propaganda that is constantly spread by the current U.S. administration and certain special-interest think tanks and groups.
Besides the romance that is brewing between McRaney and Judd, the film also conveys the importance of music in our lives, and does a proper job in expressing its virtues.
One scene that is well done and worth noting is when the crew is overtaken by a deadly breed of cockroaches.
There's almost no development in the relationships between the original travelers and the survivors they pick up along the way and throughout the entire film there isn't a single dialog that is properly written out.
After viewing you can appreciate the cult classic status of this film, yet to not be entirely sure why that is so.
All in all, a slightly disappointing but fun and under-appreciated film, that is a 7/10 from me.
I know this is a stretch, but that is how I interpreted it and it worked for me.
He looks like he is wearing a ring on that finger that is being disguised so as to not be noticeable.
The action scenes were very well done, the pirates were incredibly detailed in their clothes, and the whole island brought me back to the world of wonder that is Never Never Land.
Still, Batman: Mask of the Phantasm is a terrific piece of entertainment that should not be skip by anyone that is a fan of Batman, animation, or film in general.
This is an animated film with an unusual amount of emotional weight and resonance that is balanced with a strong dose of action Â a gem all the way.
Even as it was meant originally for TV, the directors Radomski and Timm, through their writer collaborators, have applied a drawing style that is distinctive amongst other cartoons of its ilk from the period: very direct lines and sharp, jagged edges, lots of smoke at (specific) times, the right blend of noir when it comes to revealing the caped crusader when he enters a room in the dead of night.
there is a mysterious killer that is going around Gotham that is murdering a gang of now old gangsters and Batman is being blamed.
This one did it for me and that is why I watch it whenever it's on TV.
The origin of my favorite superhero has been overdone so many times and yet the filmmakers easily succeed to bring new insight and depth to the man that is the bat.
The only complaints is that the animation could have been better at some points, but that is because it was originally meant to be a straight to video release before Warner's saw what a masterpiece they had created, and also it should have run for a little bit longer, but oh well.
But later it is revealed that he does work for a organization that is trying to take down the terrorist group leader Nathir and get a hold of the terrorist plans.
But that is just because I am a huge fan of his.
It's obvious that the film's screenwriters are trying to make the point that Samir represents the MAJORITY of MuslimsÂthat is, they are peaceful people who reject the methods of terrorists.
A brain washed enemy that is willing to die in the name of religion - The fundamentalist Muslims .
To sum up traitor is 2 hours of fast flowing predictable fair that is hard to criticise but is also difficult heap praise on.
This movie unfortunately has not one iota to compare with Sideways in case anyone is telling you such bull...   the script is slow, trite and only has one part that is fairly interesting which is the fact about the blind tasting in Paris, and the directing is so amateurish TV style that it screams Movie of the week!
About Cheadle's character, you may have heard his performance is wooden, that is untrue, he delivers a moving portrait of a tortured soul subjected to a traumatic past and exposed to soul rending choices.
First off, this is not a movie that is going to show you everything and baby step you through the plot.
I am always pleasantly surprised by how original this movie was and how it almost makes fun of all the stereotypical Hollywood bull**** that is filled with most movies today.
Bottom-line: If you are looking for a story that is more than skin deep (which the Coen brother are notorious for) then you have come to the right place.
Overall I would say that it is a funny movie that is not for those who don't like to lose characters unexpectedly and without consequence.
But mix the 2 and you get an abortion of a film that is the one I'm trying to save you from watching.
The only character that isn't up to par with the rest is Tilda Swinton's character of Katie Cox, Osbourne's wife.
What can I say to this movie that is already been said?
The few bad things are :- 1)That there are stretches that evoke nothing more than a chuckle and you crave for a distraction like some hot girls or a buildup to a big scene that is not there.
The most amusing piece of the movie is the dialogue that is spoken by B-Rad (Jaime Kennedy).
With some hilarious scenes involving a rap battle and a gunfight (hey, it was from Grand Theft auto III) this is a hit-and-hit comedy that is great fun.
MBW is one of those movies that is humorous because the characters are kinda stupid but funny.
Well, in Finland this movie is oddly called Executor, though that isn't a Finnish word.
This involves a family winning a contest to live as guinea pigs in a futuristic house that is completely computer controlled.
Kevin Kilner and his son Ryan Merriman and daughter Angie Volding are the Cooper family and they win moving into a house that is completely computer controlled.
The voices are obviously not that of the original film, but the actors do their best to bring feeling to the characters, and that is what matters.
Yes, it is a bit violent, and if that is a concern, you should not allow small children (under 8 or 10) to view this.
Women definitely had equality, and that is rare to see even in these modern times.
Convinced the will is a forgery Boudica battles to bring her people away from the slavery that is Rome and attempts to conquer the very powerful roman empire with tragic consequences.
But to begin with this is technically very bad: the props - especially those of the Roman city that is destroyed - are obviously fake, and so is this way that the raped and tortured Boudica and her daughters drag themselves home (it looks like something from a zombie movie).
He has the talent of drawing the audience into the role he is playing at the time and that is a rare thing indeed!
Lovingly filmed, a score that that is memorable & so absolutely perfect.
Coincidently, her and I have recently been searching for a decent violin for her that is affordable by actual humans, so we could relate to parts of the plot first-hand.
Similar sort of movie to "Last Of The Knucklemen", another Australian movie that is worth seeing.
I have seen bits and pieces of this event throughout the years, but never took the time to sit down and watch the whole event from start to finish; that is until last weekend.
And the whole game only took me 6 hours too complete, I don't know about you, but that is really quick as top quality games like Prince of Persia or MEdal Of Honour usually takes me around 10 or 20 hours too complete.
As the movie proceeds, it becomes more and more apparent that Nastassja has something called screen presence, meaning that whenever she is on screen there is the promise of something electric occurring that is extraordinary.
But finding a real martial art, instead of a saccharine watered down version that is a total waste of time and money, is not easy!
Unless you're a fan of Ms Hannah's physical charms, that is.
It is the story of a dance school called Mr. Jonathons dance studio that is trying to win the most prestigious of Australian dance group awards.
The story is in place and the characters are in place, but it is just put together in a very over-the-top, run-of-the-mill way that is hardly as classy as Sex and the City ("SatC" from now on).
So we need something that is close to our age, lifestyle.
I hate Brooke's husband in the show but again,(his character is pictured somehow like having a low IQ, which of course is something that can happen in life and shows her making a compromise - am sure she somehow is wishing deep inside shed have a husband that is more active from the start and not this "sorry", "shyish" boy-man that wakes up suddenly to realize he wasn't taking care of himself and blaming everybody else!.
I thought there was a certain level of realness here, that is definitely missing in Cashmere Mafia.
Foyle every week has a crime usually murder to solve, that is somehow entangled in the war effort, very cool idea.
In fact, one thing that is unfailingly depicted throughout the whole, excellent series of Foyles War is the calm control and sangfroid of the main characters that was typical back then, even if it seems to have disappeared somewhat these days.
I saw this movie many years ago,and it was plenty scary,especially,the part,where the mother wouldn't let her daughter in the house,unless she brought food,so she went to get food and on the way back,she saw white eyes looking at her,and she started to run,she got to her mothers house,but it was to late,she gets attacked by a leopard and her mother sees blood coming from under the door,when she opens the door she sees her daughter laying dead,that is about all i remember about the movie and often wonder if it will ever be released on video.
The first confrontation is it's best overall scene, as it's inside an exceptionally creepy location with some great action scenes and a fantastic conclusion that is far ahead of the types of attacks generally shown at the time and becoming quite violent and brutal.
This is a really great, chilling scene that is suspenseful and spooky.
As usual, Lewton and director Tournier know what they are doing and are able to scare the pants off the viewer with violence that is implied and is never actually seen.
The Leopard Man is one of those rare films that is very effective with shadows and fog without showing anything.
There is a sense of primitive feeling, of old religion, throughout the film, implied rather than stated, that is beyond the grasp of the hyper-rational lead players.
Then Grace says that she is doing it for some woman's movement or to make women stronger but that is all just BS.
Her voice is one that seems to be on the verge of breaking down into total incomphrensibility - it falters, pauses and staggers along - fuelled a mind that is providing the information but the mouth cannot process it fast enough.
There is a lot to this documentary that is worth discovering.
Chow turns into the kind of wild animal that is hiding inside every one of us, and that just should be kept there forever no matter what the situation is.
Overall the violence in "Prison" is very strong and hurts almost as much the viewer as it does the characters and that is the only way to depict this horrible thing honestly and in a way that something important can be achieved and told by the film.
"Prison" is composed by Lowell Lo, who has also made the soundtrack for films like "Naked Killer" (Clarence Fok, 1992), "The Killer" (John Woo, 1989) and Ringo's "School on Fire" but the usage of music is never as near as strong in "Prison" as it is in "School" and that is also among the elements that make "School" such a strong experience.
The story has this people living in a building that is about to be taken over by some corporation...what this has to do with anything is beyond me as this is never touched on after the city goes crazy.
Along with Shane Carruth's "Primer," Jim Mickle's "Mulberry Street" is proof that independent cinema is alive and well in the United States, despite all that is done to force it into an early grave.
This movie just flat out didn't have time to do anything like that (that is once it really got going), it moved very fluently.
The movie takes its time to unfold as you get to know the characters and slowly learn about the mayhem that is beginning to unfold in New York.
I doubt "Mulberry Street" will become a film that is easily available, so if you have the opportunity to watch it some time, do not hesitate.
Like Spike Lee's greatest films, this is one that is bound to make a lot of people angry.
For those who saw his heavily acclaimed (by critics and audiences alike) "Welcome To The Dollhouse" a movie about the hell almighty on earth that is junior high school.
It tells the story of a listless and intelligent teenager who lives with an angry and sad family in suburban New Jersey, and also about the documentary that is being made about them.
In fact Non-fiction has a begin, a middle and an end, but that is not the reason why you will like the movie.
Well, i love Tod Solondz, in my directors all-time ranking i'll put him on the same level as lars Von Trier, just under Ingmar Bergman, and igmar bergman, that is the top.
City of Ember is a movie I fear that is destined not to do very well.
Still, it is a fun, sophisticated, and exciting film that is well written.
It's painfully short and saying that is a paradox of a compliment and a flaw.
However, the instructions are lost and the inhabitants stay in the city that is completely deteriorated.
During his explorations of the piping systems, he finds a mysterious room that is unmarked on his maps.
However, the instructions are lost and the inhabitants stay in the city that is completely deteriorated.
As a result I found City of Ember to be a gratifying and sensually enticing experience with brilliant performances, an endlessly captivating story and pace, and a great mix of fantastical environments and characters which pave way for subtext that is grounded in simple allegory of our own, current world.
What follows from here is a story that isn't entirely unfamiliar (in fact, it's dangerously close to this year's WALL-E), and yet director Gil Kenan manages to take the script and turn it into his own compelling take on a tried and trusted concept.
If there's one thing that Kenan manages to get across here however, it is the imagination and vision that is present in the script and story.
Sure enough there are countless rough edges present, and characters, although compelling in their quest, fail to resonate emotionally, but the overall adventure itself Â that is, the tale Â is one that will be sure to captivate imaginations and the attentions of many diverse audiences.
A bunch of doofuses who can't act in real life get together on an island to make a stupid film that is so atrociously fake-acted that it hurts to watch.
I only counted three dialogue intertitles (that is, title cards stating what the seen characters say), and they occur near the end of the movie.
Given that this is an early eighties film, you've got to expect some tacky visuals and an even tackier soundtrack; but the film takes these elements and then delivers a story that is far too serious in tone, and it doesn't bode well at all.
He will be released in a few weeks and Hunter must find out if that is correct.
It may not seem as original and maybe it isn't, but I am still thinking about it, 12 hours after I saw it and personally I think that is great in this era of popcorn films...  Other aspects that are part of a movie, like lightning and acting are really great!!
I won't refer to the story or the subjects it's about, since none of that is necessary here.
Actors doing such a great job... Andy Garcia playing so well that you may think that is not a movie but a Real TV story.
Especially to anyone living in Montreal, as that is where it was filmed.
Accompanying the DVD (already in excess of 157 minutes) is a 'making of' feature and a discussion period with not only Ang Lee but also with the stars and production people that is very solid commentary and for once seems pertinent to enhance the enjoyment of the film.
Considering it is now 20+ years old, it contained technology that is deployed by the military today (light flashes and how it affects the human brain).
In the screening I went to though, people seemed more shocked at the only violent scene in the film (that isn't mentioned in the films' rating) than the initially "controversial" sex scenes.
Many of the instances are pretty much rape, and that is something one should know going into it, in case it will deter your wanting to view the movie.
Enter Tang Wei's Chia Chi, in a strategy hundreds of years old, and that is to use the lure of the beauty to provide the downfall of powerful generals.
If so, that is really smart.
It's very much like a noir and a war film and romance is probably the genre that is represented least.
The film proper lists one Al Beresford as the director here, but the IMDb reveals that is a pseudonym for Brit helmers Stanley Long and Michael Armstong, who both a have a history in the softcore UK sex comedy scene.
They gain a special friendship that is hoped to become love.
One thing that is very obvious from the beginning is that this is a french tale.
The Prince (that is, the Beast as a human being) almost looks like Jean Michel Jarre with that long hair.
But with the time, Belle is going to discover all the magic that is beyond the castle, including the talking objects and even a nice side that the Beast has.
Secondly, it's a classic fairytale that is also quite dark.
There is so much here that is missing in other Disney classics.
Indeed, it's a tale as old as time, with a complex message that is as ageless as it is universal; but beneath all the layers it can be summed up very simply: love one another, and refrain from judging others who `seem' to be `different.'
With the help of a richly textured screenplay (by Linda Woolverton) that invests the characters with a depth of humanity that is often lacking even in `non' animated films, and an Oscar winning score by Alan Menken, director Trousdale provides some real insights into human nature in this retelling of the familiar story of how true love can change even the darkest and coldest of hearts.
There's a scene in this film that is so entrancing and so emotionally involving that it stands up against the best from any drama ever made: As Angela Lansbury (as Mrs. Potts) sings the Oscar winning title song, Belle begins to perceive the true nature of the man within the Beast; and it's no longer the cold-hearted Prince upon whom the enchantress cast her spell, because he has changed.
This films is a major recommendation for me, it's one of my favorite Disney films of all time, it's a timeless classic that is just perfect and reached a new level of great animation.
The movie takes one whole hour to set its plot (that is Â a whole hour for the drug dealers to loose their drug and our "heroes" to get a hold of it), and only then, the actual story begins.
The main problem is the group just do not have enough new material, John's heavy drug use make him just a passenger.However his ego will not allow George to take a more central role and this is why George walks out of the group and not the argument that is so often referred to by everyone who has seen the film.
It may be somewhat slow moving at times, and the music is very raw up until the final concert, but that is the beauty of it.
The out of tune notes, the messed up lyrics, and the arguments throughout the songs are great because that is how they were really written.
And in the end, that is all any of them wanted.
It appears that John really isn't serious about the Beatles in this one, and that is the only real evidence of the near breakup, but it can be taken two ways.
It all leads up to that rooftop concert that is still one of those big bad-ass moments in rock and roll history (if, again, not filmed with the best lenses or cameramen, it was perhaps a given that they had to shoot it on the fly).
(Oh, and while I did know of George's argument with Paul over George's guitar playing from an outtake that was used in "The Beatles' Anthology", only Paul's explanation to him about that is in here.)
So, it's this grim reality creeping into the once magical world of the Beatles' recording sessions that is tense and uncomfortable to watch here.
No, that is not too common nowadays, either.
If that isn't one of the coolest scenes in film, I don't know what is.
The captain locks the stowaway in a cabin and the time tunnel personnel can not retrieve him; his partner Doug Phillips decides to travel to help Tony to leave the cabin that is located in the damaged area of the doomed vessel.
Without revealing the brilliant twists at the end, allow me to say that this film explores trust, ideology, and friendship in a way that is funny and poignant.
finally when it comes down to the line, a crisis situation that is going to affect the rest of his life, he grows into his own skin and decisively chooses his own path.
I'm sorry but that is the *last* place any anarchist I know is going to blow up.
He has a part of his "show" that is dedicated to the "most outrageous or untrue thing said on the behalf of John McCain", entitled, "McCain in the Membrane."
How to put such a travesty like the Bush administration into a context of articulation (and one that isn't of full-on satire like the Daily Show)?
I read the reviews and I was surprised at the results.I think that Looker is a terrific movie.It has everything that you could want in a movie, strictly for entertainment value.You can sit down, relax,and just escape into a good science fiction thriller.The movie is campy and cheesy in some parts, but that is what makes the Looker fun.
It is a story of loneliness, and a story of innocence that is so real that you can't get away from watching it once started.
It's possible that critics and/or viewers weren't so analytical back then but against that is the fact that less than a decade had passed before the Musical Queen of the Warner lot went up against the ex (just) Musical Queen of MGM.
Doris as the tomboy first baseman hasn't quite discovered men yet, that is until she almost shoots Gordon MacRae.
Of the family members, the most memorable is Billy Gray ("Bud" from FATHER KNOWS BEST), as he is a terrible little brat that is a lot like Dennis the Menace and the Problem Child all rolled up into one.
PS - Robert Wagner is gorgeous - he is more beautiful than the women if that is possible.
Well what is there to say about Megalodon, Well the CGI is OK the Station looks like CGI and so dose the water and ICE around it The shark looks like a Shark that is disproportionate his body is big and his mouth is really small.
I wasn't born at the time that is depicted in the series (the year 1956), but it is all very convincing.
He has a mysterious past, appears to be well-to-do but prefers a shadowy existence in a lower-class dive, has nothing but good-will for the world, with a wry, wizened sense of humor, yet there is a strange underlying sadness or depression in his make-up that is never fully revealed let alone explained.
She was beautiful that is until she spoke, revealing the most dreadful accent.
You see, there is a theme that is uniting that play's characters.
In a fit of jealousy one evening, Brundle--who has only recently met with success in teleporting a living ape--steps into the pod-like contraption, unaware that a housefly is trapped inside with him; afterward, he exhibits an abnormally stunning physical range, and undergoes a transformation that is truly horrific (Cronenberg, with the assistance of makeup artist Chris Walas, spares us no small detail).
"The Fly," like "The Phantom of the Opera" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," shows us a monster who is reduced to a grotesque (and in the case of Brundle, inhuman) appearance, while still endowed with the bare instincts of love, morality, and fear; under increasingly heavy makeup, Goldblum retains his trademark sardonic wit, but it connects with a plaintive sorrow that is truly affecting.
It makes "The Fly" a one of a kind movie that is an absolute must-see, at least if you have a strong enough stomach, for this movie definitely isn't for the faint of heart.
I was, in fact, quite strongly reminded of Darren Aronofsky's 2000 film-adaptation of Hubert Selby's novel "Requiem for a Dream" Â although the subject matter differs greatly, both films derive their horror elements most strongly from a place that is completely removed from Horror Â and in both examples the source is basically Love.
There's something present here that is totally lacking in nearly every horror movie of the 1970s and 80s and that's pathos , we feel sorry for Brundle as he has his genes spliced and starts to mutate into Brundlefly and in many ways the movie feels more like an update of James Whale's FRANKENSTIEN or a remake of THE WOLF MAN featuring an insect mutation instead of lycanthropy .
In FOUR'S A CROWD he's the nation's richest man, who has a secret passion that is sillier in it's way than trout fishing (which, after all, is exercise).
There is a tremendous scene with a coffin that is the very height of anxiety, despair and cinematic tension.
It is a huge pay-off that is advertised with great skill and execution.
The fact that it is based on short story by Dashiell Hammett puts in a class above the rest with a story-line that is frighteningly plausible.
It is weird, but in all the time that I have spent watching this movie and watching the commercials I thought that I would never ever be able to tell them apart (Heather and Heidi, that is), but after studying it, I could tell them apart just fine.
I am so glad Zac was in 'The Suite life of Zack and Cody' because that is my favorite show and he is my favorite actor.
It is depressing, however, to realize that Hamilton died at such a young age and, all kidding aside, that is a very sad loss.
This is a formulaic film that is very reminiscent of many of Clark Gable's films of the era (particularly SAN FRANCISCO) as well as the crime dramas that made Warner Brothers so popular in the 1930s--though this film IS from MGM.
Sure it's predictable and almost impossible to believe, but this doesn't matter too much due to the film's quality throughout--that is up until the end.
This is a wonderful movie that is completely overlooked.
The Bad Guy is a bad guy, that is pretty clear but doesn't make me care.
But he is capable of presenting so much more, and that is precisely what this film lacks.
But their is a certain amount of culpability that is shared between Han-ki and Sun-hwa in the film.
Pretty strong stuff that is pulled off quite well - for the most part...
Unable to do so - she is coerced into prostitution by a group that is run by the thug and his boys.
And that is the greatness of this film: it's honesty about men and women, and an in-your-face courage to face the truth.
What actually happens is beyond expectation in a way that is likely to stun and totally engage the viewer.
Yes, this is a love story of sorts and yes they do fall in love in a way that is debased and seemingly fated.
"Bad Guy (Nabbeun namja)" is an earlier film of Ki-duk Kim that is probably being released now in the U.S. due to the success of "Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter... and Spring (Bom yeoreum gaeul gyeoul geurigo bom)," but fans of that visually entrancing parable should be warned how very different this exploration of the depths of human nature is.
One thing that is very annoying though is that when i rented it today the cover said "1:a pÃ¥ biotoppen" (number one at the boxoffice (which almost maid me NOT rent it)) which is funny as the movie has only 86 votes here.
That makes me wonder; WHAT boxoffice :)  Summary: This is definitely a movie that i recommend you spend a few bucks on renting (that is if you looking for something different from the mainstream hollywood tv dinner).
Chuck is a cluck again, but Snoppy and Woodstock save the day - and Thanksgiving - when they prepare a beautiful gourmet meal.... for a beagle and a birdie, that is.
Thanksgiving is not really something that is acknowledged and certainly not something that is celebrated in Scotland, but I watch this TV special every year in the run up to Xmas just to get me in the mood.
Musa was one of these films that is so absorbing that after two hours when the film had ended, it seemed like on an hour and a half.
I guarantee anyone who's seen SS5+ and just read that is curled up on the floor wiping their eyes right now.
That serious moment opens up a floodgate of seemingly subconscious events and comedy that is meant to jar you from the underlying essence of the movie for a moment.
To some extent, that is how they really are.
Then put it on overdrive and string it with Christmas lights...and you will only have begun to envision the glorious assault of brightness and fashion that is SURVIVE STYLE 5+.
In summary, a pleasant film that is a feast for the eyes.
For Amelie sex is not something that is intimidating, temptingly desirable, sinful, adult, or lustful.
She convinces her father to travel abroad using his garden gnome; she helps her neighbor that is an outcast and lonely painter and the super that misses her unfaithful husband; she also helps her hypochondriac colleague that works in the tobacco shop and the man that stalks the other waitress acting like cupid; she plays pranks to an employer that mistreats his employee with abusive relationship.
the "Orgasm Montage" has to be one of the funniest scenes in cinema history and that is one of the many reason why this movie is awesome   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
`Amelie' is the first film where I adored the subtitles and in fact, had a nagging urge to go out and learn French that is still with me today.
She has her own idea of justice that isn't very disagreeable.
The story about AmÃ©lie (Audrey Tautou) is a modern day fairy tale and that is exactly how it looks the entire film.
Oh, and Sid Caesar did a couple of things which may be construed as humor, though that is certainly a subjective construct.
"Midnight Blue" is a rare case of a soft core flick that is interesting not only because of the sex scenes, but for the plot.
There's something about these stories that is very detached and unemotional.
Moore is acceptable as the film's Diva (she never really commands the screen, but she has a odd sort of like-ability) and Cary Grant is in fine form as her "rented" mate, but they are playing stock characters who only seem to behave in the manner that is necessitated by the script.
Their relationship suffers numerous ups and downs throughout the course of the film, but I never really cared whether they ended up together and that is a serious determent for this type of picture.
She is simply Garbo and that is enough.
Maybe that is why it died at the box office after a few weeks without really making it big.
He umps the local games and know that is just asking for trouble.
No, this film is not about physical attraction: it is about the kind of love that is a basic need in each of us and one that sadly is lacking in so very many lives today.
But it is James Ponsoldt's meaty script that is really thrilling.
It is on this canvas that writer/director James Ponsoldt, in his first feature, crafts a work of art that is simply one of the most poignant love stories imaginable.
The good definitely outweighs the bad and that is why I give a ten.
What's nice about this movie is it follows a basic rule of thumb- it's not what you see but what you don't see that is scary.
Through stylized photography and artwork and a score that is close to a hauntingly sweet jack-in-the-box, watch out!
The film has the air and atmosphere of a swaddled cot-death baby and I fear that is due more to neglect than over-nurturing.
Unfortunately the plot is somewhat vapid which is why I don't necessarily recommend the movie other than for its pivotal place in a movement that is gaining momentum.
I've read some the reviews that people made in regards to this movie and all I can say is take it easy - this movie DOES NOT deplict the average latino but it does reflect a funny view to the Casanova that is actually a nice guy who actually falls for 3 different ladies.
And that is the real challenge.
There is a theme given to every characters that is shown by camera positioning, specially the background.
What I like most about this movie is that it opens a window into an unknown world for me, that of relations between men an women in modern Egypt, and it does so in a style that is at the same time sumptuous an unfamiliar.
Schwartz delivers a film that is in no way exceptional nor particularly memorable, but it is entertaining.
With Duryea, and some able supporting players, there is an emotional impact that is not easily dismissed.
A Climax of Blue Power is an excellent roughie flick as it combines hardcore porn with a storyline that is actually interesting.
A CLIMAX OF BLUE POWER is a strong piece of 70s sleaze that is equal parts crime/drama and trashy porno.
Well, if that is true, I just cannot wait to see another one!
Which is very important because most people are eating what the American Media is giving them to eat: Bu**Sh**  And no matter what the truth is, it is not the official report and that is a fact for sakes.
The problem is that not a great deal of it really hangs together, at least not in the way that is presented here.
(also the phone report of one eyewitness that is contradicted by photographic evidence is given a great deal of weight) And at times the film throws things out-like the off loading of passengers, but gives no evidence as to why this may have happened or what happened to the people.
He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film).
And that is what this "documentary" is build around - misinformation and misunderstandings.
I'd say that is pretty suspicious.
If you knew what the Bush family has invested in the middle east then you know that is a big enough motivation for them to kill anyone in this world.
For whatever reason there are many who think their leaders deserve their unquestioning, unwavering faith and trust, to accept everything and anything that is thrust upon them as necessary and true.
Maybe I missed the whole point and it is not intended to be a horror movie at all but a comedy on pair with "Not another teen movie" and the likes but if that is the case there were 3 of us in the room that missed the point.
Such waste of time both for makers and viewers of the movie .The movie tries to follow clichÃ©s of both genres but the result is not convincing like the guy who stipends relieving of his virginity, and more unbelievable that is the caring and responsible alien type who think for a species that their survival is based on their distinction.
Of course, one could recover from this by making a film that is bad or oddball enough to be funny.
And that is the biggest point I wish to make here.
Which makes the lighthouse at Cape Horn an international concern which was something that is ever present in Jules Verne's writings.
No real comedy either (but that is common with a lot of sex comedies).
There is a sequel in the works that is either just trying to make a quick buck or might actually explain some of what happens in this movie.
Her character that is.
I don't know whether they give Oscars for casting, but if that is the case, the person responsible for casting for this film must be at least a nominee.
Now that is over I have to say that for once I actually liked her character.
I am not sure if that is the image we are suppose to get.
He is hubby, son of a nut and that is his role.
Things went rapidly downhill from there, yes the scenery was attractive if you like that sort of thing but credit for that is due to mother nature not the cinematographer.
Then again you don't know what that is so maybe not.
i had always associate Yeong-ae Lee with a sort of saccharine , sweet piety but watching it showed a different side and made me admire her deep humility, a virtue that is strange to us now a days, Yeong ae Lee infuses her character with beauty , wit, and intensity.
Not hooked but enough interest to keep me going...same with the next one...and then when I finally got to the part when the little Jang Geum became orphaned and out-shone the other little girls in the palace in her determination and diligence, that is when I really got hooked, which brings me to a suggestion ... watch the first 3 episodes in their entirety.
The actors/actresses are handsome/pretty, but that is not why I continued.
Keeping in mind that remakes usually face high expectations in case of their classic "predecessors", I watched this movie without much referring to the older version and that is how I intend to comment on it underneath.
This movie is simply made and concentrates closely on the story, and it's the story and the acting that is compelling.
All in all, Tangents falls in the same general category of MST3Ked films as Overdrawn at the Memory Bank; a small budget film that is ridiculous enough on its own merits to make it a decent watch for lovers of pure cheese (though, as always, I recommend watching the MST3K version instead).
