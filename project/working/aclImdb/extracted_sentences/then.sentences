First in nightclubs, then radio, the Zigfield Follies in New York and finally, Hollywood films.
The film, however, is altogether less fatuous then that director's most famous works ('Meet Me In St. Louis' is visually beautiful but sentimental and patronising).
He fights the head zombie, which consists of him getting his punch caught, and then ripping the head zombie's heart out.
By 1927 Etting was a popular singer and a major Broadway star, and when talkies arrived the couple moved to California, where Etting became a favorite for the musical shorts that were then in vogue.
Lillian Roth's story "I'll Cry Tomorrow" portrayed by Susan Hayward, The Helen Morgan Story, The Country Girl, then "A Star Is Born," and countless of other fictional or non-fictional films on vocalists who pay the ultimate price for fame.
The real Ruth Etting seems frail and too sweet, she's adorable, which makes me wonder why she hooked up with a gangster anyway but then again looks can be deceiving, I heard she wasn't the sweet, girl next door type in the first place and she wasn't so naive and a pushover like Doris Day portrayed her.
So then she attacks Goldie with a shotgun--blowing her across the room into a fountain.
But then comes the 'women's fight for man' except here one woman is just looking for 'immortality' (as many have put it) and that is basically the only part in which it differs from other movies.
There is  a long pause on the other end of the phone, then Hawn slowly  asks , ".
And then they fight!
But then of course the essence of humor would be lost and I would be deprived of hands down one of the best comedies I have ever seen.
But then again, it won an Oscar for its effects.
I saw this film when i was about 9, since then i have been hooked on it!
Madeline is first dumbfounded then jealous.
Many have made a good or even flawed but interesting first feature, and then either showed how good can really be (i.e.
Stevens then retreats to her radio office to conduct a question and answering about zombies.
We then see the worst acting of a man and his son hunting zombies, and a tiger is involved...er something.
If someone actually likes them, then they need help!
The AI in combat is adequate(compare it with the AI from Mark of Chaos, which is two years younger and performs worse) although it is unable to learn from failures, so once you find the key to defeat a specific army composition(horse archers vs infantry) then the AI will not adapt his army to the new challenge.
The Transformers movie was nowhere near as violent as this movie was and even then at least the writers of the Transformers movie waited until somewhere near the middle before they even started killing off characters.
and many others then I strongly recommend that you watch this show!
If you wanne see this movie and your expecting something like "from dusk till dawn" or "near dark" or "the lost boys" -all fabulous vampire movies- then you'll be wrong and you will be watching a boring drama.
Indeed, as it's down, down, deeper and down from then on.
He swears and he swears and then he swears some more.
The beginning looks good, the musician picking up a gal, and then her getting murdered.
Considering it was one of RKO's biggest hits in the late 1940's, I guess the public back then saw it the same way I see it....as a terrific film.
And if you are the same, then you need to see this one.
It makes you think twice before you might think: I would like to have lived then!
One scene has Laforgue transcribing a brief story told by the Algonquin chief and then having Daniel take the transcription some distance and read it back to another tribesman.
The Hurons are prepared to skin the rival chief they have captured literally alive, after killing and then burning alive his children one by one, essentially to make a political point.
The movie ends on an apparently hopeful note and then reveals--through text--something utterly depressing about the near future, reflecting perhaps Moore's reluctance to show a happy triumphant Christian ending.
We see a few sexual scenes and then some brutal violence.
Ever since then I have been 'hooked'.
'Blackadder Goes Forth' then is not only one of the most hilarious comedies written - better than 'Mash' if you consider the contrast between its scope and its brevity - but it is also a fitting tribute to all those poor souls who toiled and died and were lost.
Okay, there is Chaplin's Shoulder Arms, but then I fail to think of anything - apart from these glorious 6 half-hour long pieces of British Comedy.
If you have grown up watching TV comedy US style only then you may find the conclusion of the series rather disturbing.  
But then, as the story unfolds, you realize it HAD to be shot in black and white; it had to have that raw, gritty quality.
It then goes back twenty years earlier to a poor, Southern farmer, Jackson Fentry.
Everything seems normal for awhile, but then two tragedies happen they lead up to the present opening of the film.
He then cares for the baby as his own child and they become very attached.
Therefore if you can get passed this flaw and you want an atmospherically rich, well-paced, scary horror film then this is you best bet for modern cinema.
And then there's the really good ending.
If you just plain don't like being frightened in movies, then stay away.
The busy Laura does not gives much attention to her son; then she sees a mysterious masked boy and SimÃ³n vanishes.
If you like your films dark and brimming with mystery then this is an absolute must-see.
But then comes the movie, the script, the score, the acting, all in perfect harmony... and you jump, and you chill and you shout and you wish you had never entered that dammed cinema.
I thought, er, no Japanese comedies come to mind--oh, yes, SHALL WE DANCE was hilarious (back then), but nothing beats ATTACK THE GAS STATION in pure lunatic fun!!
You've got 4 thugs who rob a gas station, then decide to stay and work there all night, presumably to make some money.
The plot is very Simple and easy, some guys rob a gaz station in the middle of the night, and then go back again to rob it, but find out the moneys not there this time.
Attack the Gas Station is the wacky story of a "gang" of 4 Korean youths who have a bad case of boredom, so what better to do then rob the local gas station?!
An adrenalized, ultra-stylized, comic-book-violent black comedy about a group of well-scrubbed but very alienated youth who rob a gas station out of boredom, before then deciding to return and run the place for a night, pocketing all of the sales, and then taking off.
Seong-jin Kang, who plays Ddan Dda-ra (a failed musician) and Ji-tae Yu, who plays Paint (a failed painter who likes to create nudes, then throw paint across them and shout `I'm a genius!
After the opening credits, Satan seduces Sister Mary and then the Horror starts immediately.
But even when I saw it back then, I had an appreciation for the relationship dynamics between the female and male lead.
- then we see a baby-ish Frankenstein monster crushing the glass with his hand!
BRONSON reran on TV for awhile in the 1970s and then simply disappeared, It would be great to catch up with the show someday on A&E or Bravo or TV Land.
This isn't a kid's film but then again Film Noir probably isn't a kid's genre.
And then they could have got home in a film!
When Naomi Wildman was scared of her initially but then became her friend often by her side, that was lovely.
Was anyone else taken back a little by the change from French to English and then back to French without any notice.
If you (as I do) rate films & plays by how much after-show interesting conversation they provoke, then this film is at the top.
Her behavior from then on becomes increasingly erratic, which is an indicative of what happens to a person who's become so attached to another and the horror that slowly arises to the surface when those ties are suddenly, irrationally severed.
Vincent and Marie begin making love, seen mainly through the motion of their hands... and then Jean's hands come into the left of the screen, identified through the blue shirt she bought him.
She seems unable, unwilling, to face what has happened, and one of the more heartbreaking scenes of her anguish take place in a small montage where she is seen alone, sitting on a subway station, then riding the train, looking forlorn and empty.
Chi Ming sing then forces Cheuk Yi-fan to kill him allowing his wife's spirit to rest in peace.
If you're into that kind of masochism though, then this is definitely your movie.
I think perhaps the director suffers from ADHD, or some such malady, as he wants to do a Satanic movie, but then again, Satan does not have the power to do anything...?...I don't know.
At age 10, she survived a deadly fall of a rooftop thanks to her mother, who made a pact with Satan himself (apparently, the Dark Prince didn't have anything better to do then to stroll around in hospitals) and, to return the favor, Nikki, after a life of infertility, will give birth to the Antichrist!
First she inherits a large sum of money, which allows her to move to the apartment complex where He and his accomplices live, then a poor dog has to die and then finally, she has to be rescued from a running wild car old-timer!
And then when Nikki walks out of the church with her baby, He just stands there and WALKS away?!
I have a copy somewhere that I recorded off HBO or something way back then.
Though, even then it would have probably gotten dull sooner rather than later due to its one-joke premise.
Anyway There is a part where the ass**** teacher is playing a blues type jam, and had said he hates it when a student is better then him, well it seams that is easy cause he sucks, he had no licks, no soul and no vibrato...then the film seams to play him up as the "mentor" when your ear can tell you he blows.... what grounds then does he have for yelling at the kids, when his own playing fails to impress..The one kid I hope keeps rocking is the 12 year old who at the end plays a amazing solo, kids got it....(teacher don't) thats all oh yeah, most adults who act like the butt monkey teacher end up profiled as weird........aside from the yelling I act the same way its fine, however I play a meaner blues and I am not as much of a honker as said butt monkey....Ps I know my grammar sucks, then again this is not about me........Peace movie fans M.Run
I would have had a lot of respect if he doused his entire house with gasoline and then tossed a cigarette in there and said "Yippy Ki-yay, motherf--ers!"
I am all for the legalisation of prostitution, but if these are the people that are going to benefit then maybe things are not so bad as they are...
Apparently whoever did the costumes wasn't alive then, because there was no attempt to find any clothing for the actors that actually resembles the fashions of that era, and sorry, but Cyndi Lauper and Blondie were not hot singers in the late 1980s or early 1990s, in fact, their careers were dead.
But then again-maybe, after all there isn't a whole lot more to this story.
America remains the only modern country who rebuilt defeated enemies and then returned them to freedom.
Say what you want, this film makes you think...  if people are truly not hypocrites and believe in the fundamental moral value that you should view and treat others as we would want them to view and treat usÂ then this film will make you thinkÂ it is this fundamental human value that really separates us from other animalsÂ well, some of usÂ this film makes us see our biases towards others and makes us wonder about our outlook on the worldÂ I film was well done and would recommend it to anyone who has a open mind and is not too single mindedÂ
Theoretically, one would feel bad for the woman, and then realize how wrong it is to treat the man the same way.
But then, that may have resulted in some of the viewers coming to different conclusions than the film makers, something that they're obviously uncomfortable with.
He then proceeds to ask the same question, but extending the time period from 1 day to 10 years.
The director then examines two identical situations differing only in their location.
The first scenario is of an American woman being hooded, and then abducted by Chinese security forces and then taken to an unknown location where she is asked some uncomfortable questions.
is used by the Arab suspect in his political science thesis and then the FBI agent questioning him asks whether the use of this statement is a call to violent dissent.
I would say if you liked The School of Rock, this is its bastard cousin, filled with profanity and a guy who starts screaming and then says he needs more coffee.
If anyone can be treated like this, then no-one is free.
If you don't believe me then just goggle "The Patriot Act" actually read it, they don't hide anything truly Orwell would be rolling in his grave at this bill.
If we are truly the most humane and democratic country in the world, if due process is still alive, then we must show it, not just say it.
For protecting one's country and people against terrorism, if the police can do anything to the foriegners, then any other country has the same rights.
The movie might have been an exaggeration, but then similar things have been reported in past.
When I watched it I consciously knew that it was the same words being spoken but then yet I did not understand why I felt sympathy for one character but not for the other speaking the same words.
But they are then hunted down one by one by an invisible enemy.
Some days I watched it more then once.
That has already been tricked into doing a job, also in 115+ degree heat, and then to top it off a out of this world galactic hunter wants there bones for collectors pieces.
The special effects, while dated, in my humble opinion look better then the snazzy "futuristic" effects we are seeing today.
It then morphs into a suspense-thriller/sci-fi film: Like some sort of Agatha Christie novel meeting "Rambo" via "Aliens."
And Dutch gets ticked off and he and his team try to escape the jungle, but they're then being pursued by an alien who "hunts" rather than kills.
Dillon is the dirty CIA agent who was best pals with Dutch a few years back and then sets up Dutch and his team, which leads to their demise and his, as well.
If you don't then your taste in movies suck!
What makes it so unique is that the story starts off as a simple but exhilarating rescue mission; but then it suddenly switches gears and becomes a fight for survival for everyone involved.
If this is the best that British television has to offer in the way of supernatural entertainment for the under-30 crowd (as it has been touted), then I must sadly report that their best is nowhere near good enough.
All of them know the right thing to do in a given situation, and every single one of them does EXACTLY the opposite, for selfish reasons, and then expects everyone else to just understand that they are sorry, that everyone makes mistakes.
This show is way beyond its time and better then anything I have ever seen.
A thriller dwelling more on the sensual and personal aspects leading to downfalls rather than, as in Buffy, merely showing the heroine entering and leaving the bedroom then skipping to the resulting disaster and fight scenes.
If all you want is fight scenes, special effects, and stunts -- then this not the show for you.
If you like sex with a background of creeping horror ready to jump out -- then try this.
It is unfair to bring the U.S. this jewel to sci-fi/fantasy fans who fall in love with HEX, to then be disappointed by not producing a Season #3.
I like it that the bad guys won, they just were not clear enough about it, probably because they wanted to have some room for a third season, fir me just another 20-30 minutes to end it properly would do.. maybe just showing a scene of angels and demons battling each other in front of the burning school and Leon and Thelma hiding in the forest where we left them, crying of fear and failure over Ellas dead body.. and then suddenly meeting old friends (Cassie, Amy, Max, Roxanne, Tom, etc) and everybody then slowly goes away to heaven(or maybe hell) together (a semi happy ending, at least for our main characters getting the chance to meet and be together in the afterlife at least) A scene where Azazel, Raphael and Mephistopheles having a last drink together sitting quiet together seemingly contemplating their bitter and unhappy fates, of course with a close up on a tear falling from Azazels check before everything erupts into light/chaos, could be a kind of fitting/funny final scene   anyway I really enjoyed this show.
If henceforth all TV shows were this brave then TV would easily pass film as the most important artistic medium today.
if this is any indication of future movies written and directed by the multitalented Steve Buscemi, then we're in store for a lot of great movies.
Nothing special, but if you like movies like me, then every once and a while a good independently made character film is enjoyable to watch.
Lars vTrier is a genius,no doubt.Everything he did,especially The Kingdom is extraordinary and very very good,shocking..but there is something that makes me feel humiliated.In Epidemic this feeling comes to its peak.It is like 'you stupid audience,watch whatever I do with your open mouth where I can put everything I want,it can be a candy or ..it'.The first I saw from him was 'Breaking the Waves' that impressed me so much that I begun waiting for the next work of the director.That was 'Dancer in the Dark'and I became a child who ate a chocolate bonbon(Danser in the Dark) after a caramelized bonbon(Breaking the Waves).In the meanwhile I found the opportunity to see Riget on the TV,this was a box filled with chocolate candies filled with caramel.Even though,all those candies were taken with no finishing,I was still a child with wide open mouth.And then 'dogville'came.Another big different candy.
ItÂ´s an annoying mess of a movie, which tries to make sense in the last scene, but by then you have been subjected to tons of extraneous footage, bad dubbing, clues and a pretentious movie-within-a-movie, also called Epidemic.
But here, von Trier does not so much tell a story as tell a story about people writing a story and then give us all-too-brief segments of that story.
And if by reading this the first thought that came to your mind is "black comedy", then go to the top of the class cause you're absolutely right.
But then again we know that Von Trier is a cynical little bugger.
Or when he looks in a mirror, turns to us, the camera, then the mirror again.
i am in grad school and i needed something to catch her attention while i work on papers and projects....i am almost finished and then it will go back in the movie pile so i can play more and read to her...but she just LOVES that little red guy.
As the movie opens, Elmo (Kevin Clash) and his freind Zoe (Fran Brill) has a tug of war on Elmo's blanket ripping, Elmo gets mad at Zoe, and then it winds up in Oscar's (Caroll Spinney) trash can, Elmo jumps into the trash can, and he and his blanked wind up in Grouchland.
When I saw it in the company of my then girlfriend, I wasn't aware of Oliver Stone's involvement and, frankly, I think that's for the good as I could quite easily have flipped channels having pre-judged it as YAHWF ("Yet Another Hollywood War Film").
Movies are not documentaries unless they state they are documentaries--and even then you can never be sure of unbiased facts (Michael Moore).
I've watched this film several times, the first time being in the late 90's, and then again just recently.
I was placated into thinking that was how life worked, then wham, the reality of musical life hit me when I went on the road in the real world.
If the fire of music is in a child it will come out if handled right, if not, then thats OK also, but don't let it just die as a faint ember of creativity...fan it into a full flame of artistic expression.
First he goes on a shooting rampage on a muslim mosque, then he kills innocent people in Kosovo.
So, the main character should be viewed as a basic person who lost his family and is loosing more and more of his soul as time goes by and he pursues his vengeance... as soon as you attach a Citizenship (American) and a Name (Guy) to his personna he becomes the representative of a nation that has been policing the World for its own dirty purposes for the better part of the 20th century... and then it becomes much harder to root for him... too bad ... Why is it that in every movie, the main characters have to be Americans?
Not to mention that it's incredibly frustrating to screw up a speed kill, and then be forced to fight your target with the incredibly ineffective dagger, from which the targets take no damage.
Folks, you don't have to get time travel right, but if you're gonna try, then stick to your own rules.
Let's pause it for 20 seconds and waste time then rewind, wow we're such geniuses.
So it begs the question....if you can use the device repeatedly, why not go back 10 minutes, then another 10 minutes.... and so on?
If you want to absolutely rest your brain and see something dumb, without humor, without actions or drama, then this is your film, go for it.
If you don't get it by then you really weren't watching.
Conway gets the money, holds them (but not the check) and rewinds the time, and then cashes the check again, still holding the money for the first time.
All my hopes for the movie disappeared then.
They follow him to a bank, where he withdraws something like $2000, and then begins hitting of the teller.
It then shows him turning on his "palm pilot" and follows by the teller throwing her drink at him.
It's almost as if the principal cast was signed up, locations scouted, and then they knocked on doors at their locations and asked people if they wanted to be in a movie.
If I can prevent one person, then I've done my part to make a better world.
It leads on directly from the original movie and yes it does look like a studio made film rather than the location shot original but that doesn't matter, what matters is the plot is not as simple as the original which really just told how they came into being and then they went around killing a few doctors.
They then take refuge in Granny Ruth's house of 'freaks'.
If you loved the first film and thought it was a great movie with the exception of the low budget and occasionally bad acting then you might not like this film very much.
The brothers and their freak brethren are then forced to defend their house from the nosy intruders...
To be honest I found this one really entertaining, much more then the first one that was more like an"original" slasher movie!
Then Ruth hide them away from outside world with her family and then they find out that, Beiial is not one of a kinda as there are others like him in her house that she takes care of.
There are very funny scenes in this movie and gore was good not as gory as the first but then make up effect for the Freaks were GREAT, or outstanding and I really like the way the movie ended as it perfect ending for this movie.
I remember watching this on TV in 93 to 97 and loved it then and love it more now.It takes me back to a better time in my life.
Anyways, if you're an open minded person, and can overlook some "moments" and try to take in the plots of episodes, then you can enjoy this show.
If you're a big time nitpicker and that's all you do, then stay away from it and leave it alone.
Martin or Jay as he is called is a teenager from Buenos Aires, Argentina that overdosed himself with certain drugs for dogs then his father who lives in Spain comes worried to see him takes his son back to Spain (against his own will).
The plot is banal, and the filming nothing complicated, just a camera fixed to let all the attention to actors........but then, the hit.
Also funny how the puppets are quite human in the beginning of the movie and then towards the end are really robotic.
They buy rights to film a book, but then change the guts out of the book!
If you love the artificial look of Hollywood musicals of the fifties, you'll love the never-to-be-seen-again soundstage creations of the then newly formed Zoetrope Studios.
It's a classic/simple story of a couple who have lost the spice in their relationship, who break up, seek other people and then discover that, perhaps, what they had was better after all.
Possibly a classic, Francis Coppola's R rated 'One from the heart' has a very simple plot line set in neon lit Las Vegas in which a man and woman are tired of each other after living together for five years, they split apart for a night, then somehow or other they get back together.
Over the course of a day they break up, meet a fascinating new person, have a one-night-stand and then come to realize what they want most in life.
And then there is the visual side, a smorgasbord of lush effects and glaring colors.
Just saw the film again, and except for being a tad embarrassed that we wore such silly clothes back then, I think it holds up beautifully.
This would then be the sunny side of the melancholic DRACULA.
A beautifully filmed and well acted romantic film with wonderful music score and songs from Tom Waits, who was then nominated for Oscars in the Best Song category for this picture.
If so they came to the right place for the amoral Loic is happy to oblige, first by seducing Nicole - not terribly difficult as she was ripe for seduction - and then, with less success, Jean-Marie.
"The Staircase" recounts the investigation, pre-trial strategies, familial turmoil and then the trial of a wealthy author (Michael Peterson) accused of murdering his a corp exec wife.
I saw this movie when it was released and have been looking for a copy of it on DVD since then!
But you can't argue what you CAN see in the film...  Now let me start by saying that I won't go into details about the case (in which novelist Michael Peterson was found guilty of murdering his then wife, Kathleen; the case is now up for appeal, by the way).
Just keep in mind that choreography was not then what it is now.
The pain of Michael, a gay youth who tested the envelope by turning up for his junior prom in drag, then being both rejected for admission and beaten badly, is acutely portrayed.
Jenna is just a doll in the movie too and a little low key then she starts to blossoms LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The acting was pretty low par...I barely believed any of them except maybe the black kid who complained about playing white parts in the plays...But then again, I guess it is hard to make cardboard characters come to life, so I guess it isn't the kids' fault if the acting comes across as less than acceptable.
Only then can they realize how much they would have wanted to see a movie like this when they were teens.
Of course, if you were a quarterback or prom queen in high school, then perhaps you wouldn't be able to relate to this movie at all.
I saw it when it first came out, and it seemed hopelessly dated then.
His mug is prominently featured in the robbery photos and then the fun ensues when he goes to his ex-wife's (Hawn's) house to engender her help after being let go by the robbers and being fully on the run from the law.
and then he says
Chase comes across as something of a schmuck here - he is forced at gunpoint to assist two men in a bank robbery, is set up to deliver the note to the teller, gets his face photographed too well by the bank's camera, and is then tossed out of the speeding car on a hillside by the two felons.
then they started naming ideas, like, hey!
then last off, another one said,"and lets tie it all together w/ a storyline that makes no sense and is embarrassingly dumb!
So don't be fooled by the poor user rating and watch the movie and then decide whether it is really that bad.
After two viewings over the weekend, the kids were quite solemnly quoting lines and then laughing.
it happens near the end when it's discovered boomer has a twin...john ma runs past onlookers, then boomer follows him.
If these kinds of things excite you, then by all means, dive in and enjoy, but if you're looking for a more straightforward horror flick, this might be a little too cerebral for you.
If you enjoy these kind of student films then this might be up your alley but Unless your looking for a Pretentious David Lynch knockoff stay far away from this film.
plot was none existent and as a werewolf movie fan was disappointed.want a good werewolf stroke comedy then dog-soldiers ticks the boxes that this film did not.Every move was so predictable it was pathetic,i mean a joke cracking werewolf come on!!!!
At least then this movie would have some entertainment value.
The opening twenty odd minutes features some gore, a Werewolf, some nudity & a massacre but then it slows down to a snail's pace & becomes incredibly predictable as it goes around in circles to pad the running time out.
I am always pleasantly surprised when a movie comes along that I have no expectations about and then it turns out to be a lot better than many other, well-known releases.
Brown then you'll love her in this movie when shes always cussing up a storm somewhere along the film.
I haven't actually seen "Deliverance" but hear it's very good, well it would have to be great to be better than this, so if you like these sort of movies then i highly recommend this one.
I highly recommend this rare horror movie, if you enjoyed "Deliverance" and "Rituals" then you should love this one, this movie gets a well deserved 8/10 from me.
The most 'innovative' part of this game are the portals, and even though Valve's Portal-mod does a far much better job at this today then Prey, it is a cool effect (at least for sight).
And some more bugs: some 'puzzles' (read: annoying counterparts) require a lot of 'spiritpower' to turn on switches and so, but if this runs out, you will have no other choise then to kill yourself in order to get more 'spiritpower' (and no, there are no spirit power-ups in the levels apart from a few).
The creative puzzles will have you confused to the max and the level design is surprisingly small but thanks to the portal technology and wall walks levels seem surprisingly bigger then they actually are.
Prey is enjoyable and somewhat stupid because when the enemy is about to throw a grenade they call out, "Grenade" and then you can easily avoid it.
The health regeneration is a little annoying at first, but then you learn to appreciate it somewhat, as it is less disruptive than having to go back 2 or 3 saves and start over.
If games were based on graphics alone, then Prey would win outright.
If you're not taking down a 20 foot alien with two gattling guns attached to either arm (Barrett Wallace eat your heart out), then you're walking up walls or walking through force fields as a spirit.
BURNT OFFERINGS and even AUDREY ROSE.... some paranormal some psychic most pukey (but DAMIEN OMEN 2 was terrific, and ANXIETY genuinely hilarious) .......and then the worst this one, THE FURY.
THE FURY should be remade as an orgasm comedy even with the same script, then it would be more plausible and enjoyable.
Both films feature Amy Irving, then a newcomer to films.
I actually found this to be more of a Comedy, but that's OK because it was highly enjoyable, and I think this should be higher then 6.0, plus the ending is absolutely hilarious!.
i enjoyed this Brian De Palma paranormal thriller/horror.it.may seem tame by today's standards,but back then,i'm sure it was probably pretty terrifying to some people.i thought it was also revolutionary.there are some pretty graphic images that i found a bit disturbing,even though i've seen a lot of horror/thrillers.but this is not just some slice'n dicer.there's a story in here,and the gory parts are part of the story.John Farris wrote the screenplay adapted from his novel.and he has quite a few excellent novels that in the right hands would make good films.
Two Jackie Chans produce less action then one Jackie Chan not much happens during the movie.
If you watch one comedy show this year then this is the one.
6 episodes of genuinely inspired barmy brilliance, interspersed with comments from those who were there (with the exception of Madeleine Wool, who played Liz Asher and then went missing and is presumed dead).
If, like me, you had not heard of this before coming across it somewhere online then do catch up with it now.
I was more then pleasantly suprised when the show proved not only to be hilarious but a much needed break from the vapid 'reality' shows that have come to expunge any palatability from our viewing pleasure.
This is one of the best things on tv today, if you ever get half a chance to watch it then DO!!!!
The star power at the time of Steve from 90210 is not enough to keep this movie going  The storyline is a good idea and could be done at least as good today and that was the one thing that had me up late watching this on TV but in the end a great idea poorly executed makes you more mad then a bad idea done well.
This film, which provides equal importance to hens and donkeys as it does to human characters, is as real as they come and yet so removed from the values of Hollywood's screenplays, then and now.
During the first ten minutes or so it seems a standard European western, but then appears a horse pulling a wagon full of onions where "Onion" (Franco Nero) is hidden.
I was nine when I saw this movie and fell in love with a then very young Kevin Bacon.
A very young and unknown Sarah Jessica Parker and then Fame star Lori Singer stars in the movie.
As soon as I finished watching the movie again, I watched it again with Kevin Bacon's commentary and then again with the commentary of the writer and producer.
It's better then 'Flashdance', what doesn't say much, but it's nothing compared to better dance movies, like 'Saturday Night Fever'  3/10
But then again, he did willingly star in Third Rock from the Sun.
Which was then overtaken by Matthew McConaghuey's "Can you see her..." speech in "A Time To Kill"
There's adorably cute Tommy, a dark-haired young man, whose first sexual experience was with gorgeous Maria, but then they got married, and he started wanting every woman he saw on the street, and so he and Maria got divorced, and now he's just trying to get a date.
If you're tired of romantic comedies with happy endings where the two lovers walk off into the sunset, then "Sidewalks of New York" will be a relief.
I found myself laughing way too loudly and then the rest of the audience seemed to realize this was funny.
The fights and the chases are fast-paced and hilariously staged, but then look at the helmersÂLam and Hark.
At first viewing it's excellent, then after I thought about the film some more I gained appreciation for it.
John Dixon was so afraid of any one finding out he was gay, that he piled on needless lies, to his parents and friends and then he began to resent Steven and despise himself.
These two boy's were very dependent on one another and the result was they became very needy, which then had the effect of suffocating one another.
But if you try to take it any deeper, then you'd have to consider the internal struggles of John Dixon, the object of Steven's desire, because that is one of the few places in this movie where something is at stake.
I think there are people in the world who would relish a movie like this, but if cliches, and telegraphed plot twists turn your stomach, then avoid this movie.
I liked how they opened by recapping the first one and then basically telling you it had nothing to do with this one.
(this is firstly a function of Margaret Gibson's source story, which is told from the author's POV) At first you get squirmy and expect that the parallel this character articulates between her and drag queen Russell - "We're both crazy" - will be used as an excuse for the good old queer self-loathing, but in fact this is in a different tradition, that King-of-Hearts, madness-as-sentimental-symbol-for-nonconformity thing that was in vogue then.
The idea of widow remarriage wasn't acceptable even then, as one can observe from the attitudes of the older generation shown in this movie.
and then all of a sudden he can't do without her?
If you fancy a touching love story, well acted, with stand back and don't get in the way direction, and with gentle undercurrents of social commentary, then The White Palace is worth a shot.
It's also about identity and about finding out that the person you truly are maybe quite different then who you always thought you were.
The film brings to life the characters in the amazing book(I'd recommend the book version of this as well, it's even better then the film).
I'm amazed this pic isn't better known, I agree very much with Ebert's review particularly(SPOILER)  The last scene that kind of does take credibility away fro the rest of the pic but then again-it maybe a little to Hollywood but the movie did (somewhat) follow the book's ending which was also positive although nowhere near the film's last scene.
That's what we wanted then, that's what we hoped for in our leaders then, and that's, oddly what we still want so desperately in this perilous world now.
There are moments in the film that remind us of things you will recall or be fascinated to know because you didn't really know the truth then.
If you love that kind of humor, then you'll really like Fire Sale.
If you're more into standard comedies, then you'll probably become very easily annoyed and change the channel.
The connection that developed between Brody and Madeline( forgot her real name) was intense, and if you can't see how their deepest desires are somewhat the same then you won't understand the movie.
That's the kind of movie you watch without too high expectations and then it totally blows you away, and you can't turn it off, and at the end you wish you could know what's going to happen now.
The story is not really Award-worthy - young, brilliant criminal buries the wife of a rich man to get some money, and then he gets interrogated by a female cop.
The first half is still remotely amusing, since the inept dialogs and cheesy massacres supply the film with a handful of chuckles, but then the whole thing gets too stupid to even smile at.
We know how this will all end, but the question of the how and when is what strikes up drama and madness in equal measure, as if even in the most predictable means it adds to the appeal (new campaign supervisors on how to speak more forcefully and with strict attention, then the scandal(s), awkward campaign stops, a not-quite assassination attempt as one of the funniest asides, dissension from reporters).
And touches of irony help along the way, like how Veronica Cartwright's reporter, who at first is not getting much of the scoop, and how she soon acquires the fired former camerman on Tanner's inner circle (let go for an uproariously stupid montage video on drug legalization, taken mostly from Tanner's notebook) who shoots like many a pretentious reality-TV cameraman- and then also reports first on the affair scandal to boot!
LIFE-SIZE could then stand toe-to-toe with ONE FINE DAY as an exercise in adult charm and chemistry.
If you want to see 80% "The Dry and the Dusty" in the music industry on the east coast -- and Yoko Ono -- and want to know their thoughts as interviewed by a fading actress (another thinly veiled theme of this documentary to me, really) then this may be the film for you.
She is then reminded, however, that the goal is to try your best, not to be the best, and that you can still be a role model and not be perfect.
At first Casey is very upset and hates Eve, her doll, for ruining her chance of having her Mum back, but then gradually she gets to know Eve and appreciates her... She even learns that she can't bring back her Mum, she's gone and she has to live with it and love her Dad with all her might, she still has him and needs to appreciate him more too...
But then Eve goes too and both Casey and her Dad are distraught, but they still have each other!
The film then develops into a slapstick comedy as this fully life sized doll tries to fit in with the real world much to Lohan's shock.
But often they come on TV and I happen to catch the first few minutes and then get swept up and, on occasion, thoroughly entertained.
Much more could have been made of these moments and I think the direction in the services suffered a bit, but then again, how do you really direct the holy spirit?
If "The Natural" is a home run into the light towers, then "The Road Home" is a dribbler to first base.
This film is not for the jaded or the cranky film geeks that shriek whenever they see a mainstream independent movie about love and difficult emotions, and then go on to dismiss it as unoriginal or cliche.
If you don't like the way the characters act then take a look in the mirror and when do we ever like every character in a movie?
But then the guillotine arrives...
If ÂThirteen Days' is a picture that President Bush, USofA, praises as an example of good warring and political enterprise, and ÂTraffic' is a film that the rest of us think can help resolve an American drug addition problem, then ÂThe Widow of St. Pierre' must certainly be the film that toys with issues of capital punishment, human rights, and the prison system in general.
Instead she uses her brains (including her knowledge of bio-science), good humour and charm, and barely resorts to firepower and then only as a last resort.
Absolutely awesome was the battle- the scale of the battle, the destruction, the disaster, the hatred and then the repentance, the scenes say it all absolutely wordlessly (Mark the scene where Asoka offers the dying soldier water, and he refuses to take it from the hated Asoka).
The song sequences of the movies now try not to have spatial and time warps and transportations, and for a film back then, it's still a technique (if you will) used to put the romancing characters in far out locales and situations.
The only time I laughed in this movie is when EUGENE LEVY's character eats red meat and then gets in SAMUEL L. JACKSON's car.
u gotta watch it for sure then.
This movie is underrated and deserves more then the 6.8 from the users' rating here in IMDb.
If you are not a veteran of Hindi films, then you may not fully appreciate this movie... You kinda have to be used to the subtitles, used to the music/dance sequences, and the basic formula that all Hindi films follow, in regards to romance.
Kareena Kapoor, as the warrior princess who acts as sister and mother figure to Arya, a cautious then enduring lover to Asoka and emerges as someone on her own personal journey, in search of her identity and sense of belonging while juggling her duties, heart and mind in a three ring circus, Kareena gives what is by far her finest performance to date.
If you enjoy Wacky comedies then this movie is for you.
I was really looking forward to seeing this, and for the first hour or so I wasn't disappointed - good story, good acting, good use of flashbacks - but then... For me, this film seemed to paint itself into a corner as it got towards the end.
I really wanted to like this film, and I did at first, but then the story didn't seem to know what to do with itself, and couldn't find an ending to live up to its beginnings.
This minute, but observed ploy, captures the film's tone of getting in deeper; of assuming something to be of a specific nature but then having to recognise a new threat, or new predicament, which furthers feelings and emotions.
If you want to watch a truly great comedy with Eugene Levy then skip this along with any of the American Pie sequels and rent, nay buy, the Christopher Guest (the genius behind This Is Spinal Tap) movies A Mighty Wind, Best in Show and Waiting For Guffman.
Having grown up in Brighton and then watched its development into a home of the stars I was intrigued to see what the critically acclaimed "London to Brighton" had to offer.
The two then visit the house of Derek's wealthy and well-connected client, the result of which forces the pair to flee London in fear of being perused by Derek and is mob of amateur gangsters.
Take two characters, down on their luck and of different ages, throw them together via sheer coincidence then add a series of spices in the form of insecure, nasty villains with just a taste of a road trip.
and then dismiss Williams' 'London to Brighton' as repugnant, morally questionable, its ending soft.
Stuart Allen cuts Derek's leg in a car with a straight razor when he sends him off to find the girls and Derek limps from then on, but we don't see the cutting.
I don't mean to make light of any of it--the movie pulls no punches, and adds some that go beyond the usual violence, too--but this is one of those recent stories where a terrible situation is imagined, and then filmed with awful realism.
Movies should be like doctors, then (to stretch the metaphor) and have some purpose to them beyond wallowing.
Abbas-Mustan after BAAZIGAR came back with SRK in BAAZIGAR which was planned after BAAZIGAR  The film is a remake of NICK OF TIME, RUSH HOUR  The movie does disappoint you compared to BAAZIGAR and is too cheesy and stupid in parts  The all detective agency office changing into a hospital.etc is too stupid The film has some funny moments but things are too lose at start  The twist in the tale where the confusion about BAADSHAH occurs it makes you interested The scenes in the plane and then the entire chain of events are well handled The film does have many convenient situations too But they are some funny moments too which make you laugh and also keeps you thrilled at times  Climax is too filmy and a complete copy of RUSH HOUR  Abbas-Mustan is good, but not at their best Music is good, title song rocks and also Mohabbat ho Gayi  Shahrukh Khan fits his role well though he overdoes it many times yet his comedy is well directed here and his pokerfaced comedy suits him most but he does make too childish and clownish expressions which irritate Twinkle Khanna is nothing great Amrish Puri is laughable for wrong reasons mostly especially wen he says OH BACHCHI Rakhee is okay Sachin Khedekar is alright in a small role Johny Lever makes you laugh like in most AM films and he is a laugh riot Deepak Tijori is okay Deepshika is average Sharat Saxena is funny Razzak Khan and Saurabh Shukla overact Prem Chopra is hardly there Neeraj Vohra is good
He solves several "cases" then gets hired to find the daughter of a famous business man who has been kidnapped.
And then of course there is a love story tossed in the mix between Raj and Seema(Twinkle Khanna) a C.B.I agent involved in the case.
If you pass up on the opportunity to go and see or rent this movie then you may aswel end your life or perhaps consider perpetual hibernation for you are passing up the opportunity to have your life changed.
He could do broad comedy and then give heart touching performances as he does in this film.
Watching the movie it's obvious that it was non-other then Richard Loo as the wise-cracking Japanese air ace Tokyo Joe who has the best lines, which he delivers in perfect English, and the scenes with him interacting with the USAF and "Flying Tiger" pilots, like Col. Scott, are by far the best in the movie.
While the story is patently silly and tough to believe (and then some), it is high-energy and most enjoyable.
She then takes off and announces to the press that she's married to someone else, and makes up a name.
This is a typical screwball comedy centering around the struggle that the independent woman has between being a career person and a wife - and apparently back then, it was one or the other.
The whole aspect behind the movie is the event that a teacher has a school boy crush on one of his students,then she gets kidnapped, and he is the one that actually tries to find who the kidnapper is and where Ally is.
He also finds that the father of Ally is more concerned about his business and sex life then he is about his daughter.
And then her past catches up to her, AIDS makes an appearance and things go straight into melodrama land.
The movie then moves onto a different plane, looking at societal prejudices against people of certain trades, as well as misinformation about the disease AIDS.
If you're up for some good old fashioned weepy, then You are My Sunshine is your choice between the two.
I have to admit I could not sit through this one to the end, but then who could?
It does have some dumb spots, so I'll cover those quick and get them out of the way: 1) A Mage summoning a creature of fire in the library of priceless lore and nobody being concerned or telling her "do that outside", then they wonder when things catch fire.
Other then those small oversights the movie was a very well done.
I enjoyed this more then the first.
If you are, then it's worth watching, as long as you can avoid speculating on what color certain beasts are or complaining that certain things aren't the way they are in the manuals.
If you are willing to look past the lower grade special effects, and the cast of unknowns then you might enjoy it.
This film takes the subject matter far more seriously than the original film, with the end result bringing me more into the story then the previous film.
Without giving any spoilers, I would have to say as a D&D'er, this film is much truer to the game then the original movie in every possible way.
Spying on them until they get into various stages of undress then whisking them away to his secret cave for later use.
If Johnny Yune's character is based on Bruce Lee, then shouldn't he at least have some of his confidence, machismo, and charisma?
This movie is much worse then it's rating and should be avoided at all costs.
But if yours has it do me a favor rent it and throw it in the trash then pay the fee to buy it (shouldn't be that much).
First the bad, then the goods... DobÃ³ Kata is the only bad thing happened to this, but she's really bad.
Surviving crewmen end up in various locations on the ice and then procede to battle the elements and polar bears.
The great arctic explorer Raoul Amundsen is called in as are the Soviets who pick up radio messages of the disaster; an ice breaker is then dispatched to assist in the rescue.
The absolute ruthlessness of this killer who enjoys raping his victims before they die by strangulation and then even eating a cookie and having a cup of coffee.
But then these same women keep winding up dead in some terribly gruesome manners and of course Eastwood is starting to think he could be the ultimate target.
If this is what passes for a great documentary at Sundance then I hate to tell you but the emperor has no clothes.
For the most part the comedy is not cheap, or dirty (Levy's lecture to Jackson on the "F" word is classic) and then they add in Levy's bad gas problem to cheapen the whole film and honestly drop this comedy an entire point in my books but it's done and said and they redeem themselves with other clever banter between them and a decent if not predictable storyline.
And even then, only on his own, no artificial lights.
The camera freezes on a certain scene (like somebody in prayer) and stays there for a few minutes and then it goes to a different scene.
If you're into blockbusters and that's your taste then you probably won't like this film.
If 'yes,', then I recommend this film to you.
From then on, Derrick uses Andy in his scheme to recover the weapons and expose the leader of the operation (Luke Goss).
If you have not seen it yet then by all means rent it..............My comments are not the minimum length for comments of ten lines of text so I will add some more.
And if you really want that, then you could watch HVM 2000.
If their aim was to appeal to socially misfit adolescent males brimming with violent urges and unfulfilled lust, then they hit their mark..   Not recommended for anyone with a modicum of taste or decency but perfect for wannabe serial killers and misfit males mentally stuck in their teens.
They only played it on Direct TV once and then it doesn't come on anymore.
Then a circular green meteor-like object lands on the plane for a short moment and then leaves.
And I admit, the film version of the story was MUCH more enjoyable then the original one from the comic.
Everything became out In the open and then all of the witchcraft and gory stuff was too over the top for the way how the show started.
When they replaced the original Quinn and added Maggie that killed the show for me from then on.
I have been hooked right from the start, and it really ticked me when they canceled it after the first year, and then moved it out of Vancouver.
If it is, then Indira Gandhi should have been happy about the way she has been presented.
She then joins Politics against her husbands wish.
A movie based on human emotions - and the struggle of two individuals who meet, fall in love and then drift apart only to meet again after many years.
If you've seen enough Abbott and Costello movies, then you should know that the actual plot is unimportant; the whole movie is really just an excuse for Bud and Lou to get into embarrassing situations and be silly.
There is not doubt that BUCK PRIVATES feels extremely out of touch with today's times, but then again why shouldn't it?
Favourite bits: playing unintelligible (to me) clubhouse dice; Abbott inoculated and Costello's reaction; the mathematics of borrowing USD 50; the historic performance of Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy by the Andrews Sisters and then the sudden end to the boogie-woogie boxing match; the unusual deadpan arrangement to Jane Frazee's I Wish You Were Here.
My favorite scene is when these two surfer buddies are too enthralled with their surfing stories to notice both of their girlfriends have unclothed, they finally notice and comment in a Spicolli manner, "You guys are nude," then they go right back to their surf discussion.
He is accepted to college and at first his gets a full scholarship but then something changes and it is taken away.
I used to watch this movie and then play it again.
But, if you're old enough to still get excited by the two words, `Dale Bozzio', then you are in, my friend.
Of course if potential perpetrators did that, then Agatha Christie would run fresh out of story ideas.
Murders, a set of suspects, all of them with a motive for the killing and then the unmasking of the killer or killers.
Each gives a performance that makes you wish they were on screen for longer; Angela Lansbury as a drunken novelist, Mia Farrow as a cold calculating murderer, etc.. One of the best is the young Simon MacCorkindale, for whom this was his breakthrough film (he is currently Consultant Harry Harper in BBC One's Casualty, for UK readers), as the man torn between love and then led to murder.
If you are easily offended by profanity, even in context, then skip this movie altogether.
If you're looking for a comedy with depth, bite, wit and excitement, then catch Midnight Run.
Mardukas tries now and then to get Walsh to open up and tell him about his past.
"Midnight Run" is a highly entertaining action/comedy movie with a heart, and if you have half the fun, watching it, as the actors obviously had while doing it, then you will have already enjoyed yourself a whole lot more than in any other movie that is "similar" to this one.
A fever dream of foul things this was started by one director, Patrick Yau, who shot five scenes before hitting a creative brick wall and then was finished by the producers Wai Ka-fai and Johnnie To who stumbled around trying to stitch it together.
Its all comes together in the end but until then its like being trapped in blood soaked nightmare with an occasional severed head.
The story is about a man (Grodin) who stole 15 million dollars from a Las Vegas gangster (Denis Farina), but then got caught by the police.
I love how they are all screaming, then you hear Ashton comment that maybe the helicopter is gone, and you hear Grodin reply, "Oh Im sure we're perfectly safe" in a very dry and disapointed tone is SO FUNNY.
Everybody needs to see it and then give it the rightful place it deserves 10/10.
9/10 then for 'Midnight Run', because as an exercise in how to develop a movie, to establish characters and plot trajectories, to bring 'em all together in a final wrap up and still leave space for a minor plot twist, it's of textbook quality.
I have seen it twice - first when it appeared more than 15 years ago, and then again yesterday.
If you are looking for some light entertainment, and you are a fan of John Travolta, Jaime Lee Curtis, Marilu Henner etc, then you will definitely enjoy this enjoyable taste of '80s nostalgia, legwarmers & all!
If you like unintentionally bad movies, then this truly IS your Perfect choice.
There are some scenes with Jann Wenner and Lauren Hutton, apparently the then in-crowd, at a party.
Jann Wenner deserves special mention even though he's probably playing himself considering he was then the editor and now owner of Rolling Stone Magazine.
Lucas, however, decides her happiness is more important; he gives the couple his blessing (and home); then, he re-joins the Army.
The camera pulls back, and we see a wolf watching the wagon train, then a bear appears and drives off the wolf.
Apparently he did this one and only movie in 2001 and then completely disappeared from the face of the earth.
the girl runs around everywhere, she does everything at top speed, make beds, deal with problems, watch the baby grow, unfortunately those of us who live life, know that a year doesn't just fly away, it has to be lived, that we have to wake up, brush our teeth, go to work, scratch our ass, come back from work, drink ourselves silly, get made fun of by vain blonde girls and then do it all over again.
Beautiful, young, Virginie Ledoyen is followed with a video cam as she argues with her boyfriend then takes a job as a chambermaid dealing with various personalities and rebuffing passes from her boss.
Ledoyen plays Valerie, a young French girl who one morning meets her boyfriend in cafe, argues with him, then runs off to a hotel a couple blocks away to begin a new job.
So if you need to kill some time then check this one out.
Caleb's performance I found to be a little dull, but the other characters more then made up for him.
Because this film basically tells us that the world is going to end before then.
If you think it will last forever, then you would be in the company of Texans, Russians and Venezuelans that thought their fields would last forever and now sit on barren land.
If you think that all the alternatives to oil that have been proposed will solve the problem, then you really need to find out just what we can expect.
If An Inconvenient Truth was about humanity's reach exceeding its grasp, then this movie is about humanity's reach falling short of its presumption.
The fact remains that long before it happens the market will force a new solution by necessity and until then its no use stressing out about it.
The thin thread that "A Crude Awakening" seems to hang its optimism on is the assumption that if enough people become fully aware of this totally unavoidable event sooner, rather than later, then human ingenuity, combined with a level of human cooperation the world has never before seen, might possibly attenuate the consequences for at least some of those who awaken.
Oh, I forgot to mention the discussion of the concept of Peak Oil: that once aggregate world oil output reaches its maximum peak, subsequent recovery will plateau and then begin a permanent decline.
Gelpke has a background in anthropology, economics before working as a news/war reporter and then becoming involved in scientific film-making.
That is the first and last piece of rhetoric - the rest is cold examination of evidence; which is perhaps one of the reasons it then has to work so hard to make its rather dry subject interesting .
She starts trying' ta get her mind offa him by getting friendly with some big lug of a hick but then realizes she still loves Cary Grant.
I wouldn't wanna give nothing away 'cause then that'll spoil it for ya and I'm no jerk.
See this film, then see MY FAVORITE WIFE--they'll satisfy nearly anyone.
If not, then at least they have a lot of similarities--intentional or not.
The Awful Truth began life as a stage play in the early 20s, and was then adapted to film twice previously in 1925 & 1929, but here for the 1937 version, director Leo McCarey {academy award winner Best Director} improves the story big time with sharp witty dialogue and an appreciative knack for letting his actors improvise at free will in the name of comedy.
What's odd, then, is that Jerry spends the first half of the film trying to win Lucy back--when *he* was the one who hadn't trusted her in the first place.
She doesn't clear up the misunderstanding as most sensible adults would because then the film itself wouldn't exist.)
This isn't your average oddity that you find on the internet, have a couple seconds of amusement, and then forget about.
He doesn't know where his wife is and then she returns in a full evening gown with a handsome "continental" man.
In these later scenes, in another of the movie's nice compositional touches, she does a reprise of a hoochie musical number performed earlier by a girlfriend of her husband's, and then falls into her husband's arms, apparently drunk.
Then again if you enjoy watching badly conceived shows of old music, that you won't understand for the most part because of the foreign language, for one and a half hours then I guess this is paradise.
If there was poor acting, or plots, or errors then I could see trashing the movie.
This movie is only watchable for the scene in which Barry Boswick shoots someone in the legs, and then states that he isn't "jumping for joy".
If I were to walk into a room where this movie was playing, I would kill those viewing it as an act of mercy, and then swiftly take my own life in order to avoid these travesty a second time.
In 1974, an American secret agent takes a blood sample from a werewolf in Budapest, then returns to the U.S., where he inject himself with it (!
If you like movies in which the actors wear timeless, well-cut clothes, move in a well-appointed chÃ¢teau with a seascape thrown in for good measure and behave in obligatory mysterious ways so that an eventual murder has been long anticipated then you won't be disappointed.
:) The photo session of the film is the one of the best, okay, they don't use such a camera and scenes to produce such shots there and then, but i don't care, it mixes great i think.
But then later both the fight and the bag appear.
There's a possibility it was shown out of order for emotional effect, but then I think the changed red sheets didn't appear at the end.
The doubts, insecurities, the ensuing pointless fights, walking out then making up.
If you have the president of the united states kidnapped in the back of your ambulance and see a kid in the middle of the street; if you know that if you swerve you're going to tip the ambulance, then you run over the kid, the damn kidnapped president of the united states is in the back of your ambulance, one kid in the street ain't sh*t.
But if you expected anything more then the loose storyline would really disappoint you.
If any of the people responsible for a US presidents security would have watched this movie then the writers are in a real soup.
then no one bothers to explain why gud guys were blackmailed to assist the plot when the same thing would have been easier with dedicated bad guys, the role of the rouge camera man, role of the rouge secret service guy, he risked his life just to retrieve the gun (I don't think the bad guys were that pressed on funds that they needed to retrieve the assassination weapon), massive car chases on 2 lane streets, at times even going the wrong way, colossal explosions sparing the lives of just the important members of the cast.
If you have a hard time stretching your mind, have a short attention span, or are totally not a fan of Dennis Quaid or Forest Whitaker, then you probably won't enjoy the film, plain and simple.
Surprisingly fresh for a relatively unknown director , perhaps , the best ultra-real action film of the year , 1000% better then self-proclaimed pure action like Wanted !A story of an abduction of the US president , played by great W. Hurt, is somehow reminiscent of the following genre of macabre war thrillers : The Domino Principle , The Parallax View , Enemy of the State , except that it is told from different perspectives, thus the title !
You can also criticize the movie for it's dialogue, the fact that it seems to go in different directions, once it starts, but then again, these things were all done on purpose.
But it seemed to start an idea and then give up on it.
Why did the director choose to start with a specific narrative style and then abandon it for the final 30 minutes?
If that was his intention, then he totally failed to accomplish his goals.
The movie shows us just enough to get by and then throws a new twist so that we forget we haven't really been told anything.
It starts off good then continually get's worse and worse and by the end you'll find yourself watching some of the worst scenes in film history.
If all you want is dumbed-down, murder and mayhem, a sort of terrorist war-porn flick, then Vantage Point is for you!
But if a decent story is an important ingredient in your recipe for time well spent, then I humbly suggest renting something that has stood the test of time, like the French Connection, instead!
And if you approach with this frame of mind, then I assure you, you won't get bored or disappointed.
If you like thriller, action and car chases all in same movie then this movie is for you.
of the action and then telling it from eight different points of view.
If for some reason you then decided that you should see what people on the internet think, you have wasted far too much time.
It was such a brilliant thing too because Brooks made a silent movie for (then)modern cinema.
If you can get past the premise of reanimating dead bodies with a few well placed electrodes, and enjoy a slow moving film, then this would be your cup of tea.
He then arranges a birthday party for a young girl he likes, where the wait staff are his dead family members.
Malcolm's one true friend is a teenage girl who he then proceeds to have a party for at the deceased doctor's home, and unfortunately things go awry when a crazed motorcycle gang crashes the party.
One day, an elderly professor (also played by Marceau in a dual role) sees his puppet show and offers Shanks a job - to come to his home to assist him is some experiments involving the artificial stimulation of dead animals via electricity, or something...why or how it actually works is not expanded on, but it involves small implants being attached to the muscles and these are then activated by means of a small control box.
But then, once it had settled in, it's actually quite a beautiful ending.
If you want to see what Lee Evans is really like doing stand-up comedy then buy this video, I couldn't stop laughing all the way through, a definite thumbs up and a must see for anyone with a sense of humor!
MST3000 was a very very funny show, precisely because it would take a movie out of context, in some cases edit the movie extensively, and then exploit any incongruities and flaws that turned up in the process.
He then proceeds to daydream (while obviously polishing or sanding the wood down to nothing) about the professions open to him if he pursues industrial arts (all of which are equally depressing).
If this is education, then I'd rather be an idiot!
I don't know why you are all trashing about it but maybe you have a good reason but I think i have said it enough but i absolutely love this movie, and to those who say it's not good at all well then I wonder why you watched it and what movies you consider good.
For very young girls, this Sinbad was REALLY nice to look at back then.
Back then, more would have.
Or just for you, if you want to curl up with some popcorn and remember "the good old movie fluff days" where special effects were done by hand and stop motion photography by the "grand-daddy" of the genre and a Sinbad movie where Sinbad actually looked like you might imagined him to look like back then and evil characters who were evil and got theirs....pretty much simplified.
This is one of the worst conceived and bad acted science fiction movie, and one asks itself who gave the credit to the director to do this movie, and then who let it be released.
The gold minotaur rowing the boat and the fight between the troglodyte and the saber-toothed tiger at the end stand out in my mind so strongly when I think of this movie.Get a copy of this movie, Jason and the Argonauts, and then Clash of the Titans and you have a fantastic Saturday afternoon of movie watching.
The obvious love between the two main characters 'Candy' Yeong-ju (Na-yeong Lee) and 'Elvis' Moon-su (Hyuk Jang, playing a very different role than from his efforts in Volcano High) seems to start too slow and then bullet ahead just in time for the end credits.
If you know who Walter Brennan is, then you've proved that you watched those Sunday afternoon Westerns as a kid, like "How the West Was Won" or "Support Your Local Sheriff".
Average road comedy that has average production quality and nothing original or new to offer as all presented here have been done better in other films of the same genre.Although still funny at times and big fans of the lead actors here will be entertained because they will see that they still have their talents in 1999.Goldie and Steve are certainly the main attractios here and they did a great performance.Very funny scenes at the last 20 minutes involving a drugged out Steve.Not a big fan of road comedies and the lead actors?Stay away then.....
For example, not content with the star appeal of the main players, there is a cameo (relatively long also) from Rudy Giuliani, then mayor of New York, as we all know.
What Â Giuliani bucking for President even then?
And then we have John Cleese, reprising his role as Basil Fawlty Â but this time, as a prancing cross-dresser also Â once again browbeating hotel staff, sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is, in this role.
So, when made in 1970, that was the city you saw: grim, dark, moody, unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke (as it was then, polluted and all).
If you've seen the latter, then definitely don't bother with this one.
If you can't see humor in this then you my friend need to lighten up, sure this won't appeal everyone comedy has changed the past decade if a comedy doesn't have any controversial meaning or non stop sex, fart jokes then its not funny but to everyone who can take a joke its a must buy or at least a rental.
They get lost because they don't know how to read a map, and then their rental GPS gets stuck in some kind of French sounding neighborhood and they end up in a fish-market or something like that with crates and fresh squishy things.
Facing certain death in France's court of law, she is given two choices: lethal injection, or have her execution faked, and then assume a new life as a female super-assassin/spy.
I did wanted to see it because i saw the other tow, but sadly i should have known that it will not be better then the second part.
Species is one of those franchises that has gone down the toilet very steeply as of recently and I am happy to say that although #4 is nowhere near as good as the first film was it is night and day better then Species 3.
In the end the two main leads both like the same girl but she only likes one of them they try to fight each other twice in the film to see which one of them is best but both times they get interupted and then they team up together to take on the mighty "SILVER FOX".
and an incomprehensible collage from various Corman productions, then the "story" begins.
This is not a film you watch for it's plot or acting but if you want to see some of the best martial Arts ever filmed then this is one film you cannot miss.
Ebert has already said that this a movie where Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Bugs Bunny and Quentin Tarantino, but i think that needs to be amended : Imagine a movie where Jackie Chan and Buster Keaton meet Bugs Bunny and Quentin Tarantino, and then the whole crew go to a opium bar for 36 hours.
You're just waiting for someone to hit on the head with a frying pan and then have their head look like a frying pan.
There may be other explanations, but to read this part in a real-life way, it means he is the one who is selling dream manuals, and Sing is just like normal people who just bought one and then,made a dream.
He has evil minds indeed, but he wishes to be a good guy, he wishes greater power will happen to him so that can save at least his girlfriend, and then if possible, save the world.
Chow shouldn't have teased us with the little bit that they danced and then abruptly take it away for the rest of the film.
After nearly two decades of avoiding kung fu movies, a copy of this one was pressed into my hands by a very dear friend... who then extracted a promise from me that I'd take the time that night to sit and watch it.
If you go to the movies to free your imagination, then this is the movie for you.
A-xing then realizes this is a battle between good and evil and that he is called to choose one side.
There is an attractive actress at the beginning who gets naked and then killed stupidly.
If you follow music closely and your into the who's who of music then you will enjoy this.
The DVD has some funny moments and some serious moments....if you like music and rap you then you should def like this DVD.
then came the beef at HOT 97 and 50 tried to make Game look bad, can u believe how he talked about the other members of G-Unit?
There are two sides to every story so if you want to hear The Game's side and you're in the mood for drama and comedy wrapped into one, then grab the DVD!
There are no secrets kept inside this DVD, The Game exposes the whole truth and then some along his mission to hunt down "five-0" that takes him from Los Angeles through New York City (including a stop to the G-UNot billboard in Jamaica Queens), finally ending in Farmington, Connecticut outside of 50's house in a final show down between The Game against the unit you must see to believe!
then they try to escape the cult and get the **** out of dodge.
The movie is never boring as we see a group of seven twenty-somethings first at a party who then get drugged and attempted to be captured and murdered by a group of loony satanics; there's a twist in the tail here as two of the young twenty-something "friends" are in fact part of the satanic group drafted in to capture the others.
It's also quite perturbing to see Jerry O'Connell's brother in this movie as there are flashes when one thinks it's him, but then the realisation seeps in that it's just someone who looks like him!
But then, Danny Fendley does that to me.
And, the story is so incredible that no cast could salvage it: An action star's wife is murdered; he's got a mistress; then, he goes from hating an intrusive reporter, to bangin' her, and maintaining his innocence via her program.
How they band together, then fall apart.
But then morning comes, and what could've been an interesting horror film degenerates into a talky, predictable, seen-it-all-before cliche.
I could go on and on about how much "Devil's Prey" sucked but then I would be wasting my time as I did when I watched this poor excuse for a horror movie.
If you watch the TV version, then this movie is very very boring because all you can see are bouncing fuzzies.
As the film progresses there are lots of naked sex scenes and that is about all this film has to offer, the acting is a disgrace and this really is the type of film production a porno studio would use as a story line and then of course the love making.
You may find yourselves waiting for something big to happen and then realize it did without the gun play or explosions.
The battle then becomes if whether he'll be able to bridle his feelings of revenge.
The film's moral purpose, then, was to show the precarious consequences of what happens when the family is destroyed.
They were given their names by their alcoholic deadbeat father, who birthed them, left them as if they were never born, then reformed his ways, stopped drinking, became a born again Christian and fathered a new family.
I did have some reservations about Joel Grey who I thought didn't quite have the style (some Broadway shtick crept in now and then, of course.)
Every possible clichÃ© of bollywood is mechanically assembled in a poor manner....all the post 80s movies with underworld theme were scrambled and their randomly picked scenes then haphazardly fitted in an attempt for movie making called "D"...Ramu has become a victim of his own past.....initially, it felt like I am watching a spoof of Satya, but heck!!
I was'nt even that lucky...a spoof is always more entertaining....Ramu's factory is stagnating...he should try to become creative for a change...all the characters were so stereotype...the lead Randeep Hooda tried to force himself into the shoes of the silent cold angry young man from the slums with an underworld acumen that was played so brilliantly by chkraverthy in Satya ...although this character can be traced back to Amitabh in films like Mukaddar ka Sikandar, Trishul etc but chakraverthy was its RGV version and so a relevant example to quote here....needless to say, Hooda failed miserably.....he would have done well if he had just played himself......Chunkey Pandey was expecting to redo "tezaab" but those days are long over....his character was damn clichÃ©d just like all others in the movie...this is an era of "Hazaro Khwahishein Aisi" when every thing has to be brilliantly and refreshingly "original"...  ..Ramu should have stopped dabbling with underworld themes immediately after "company" which was his last watchable movie and was good off course...its time he realises that movie-making is an art and you have to "think" and "create" the design every time you make a product, instead of doing it once and then letting the assembly line take care for the rest.....probably his engineering background has to do with it..
The cinematography was decent but you'll notice that each scene would start with some dialogs and then eventually be muted with a background score taking over.
If you use this technique once or twice then it feels like a great directorial touch, but you use it for every scene and it's almost like watching a silent movie!!!
If he sees a good script that will get him a big hit, then he directs it.
If he sees that the script lacks substance but could be profitable then he just gives it to one of his deputies with the lowest budget possible and all the B-grade actors that he can get for cheap.
Varma called his corporation "RGV Company" initially then he changed it to "The Factory"Â with movies like "D" coming out pretty soon he will have to call it "The Assembly Line".
The insane antics of the camel then completely take over the picture, resulting in a bravura tour-de-force of jaw-droppingly mad animation in which Humpty Bumpty snaps from wild pose to wild pose, howling in paranoia one minute and playing some inexplicably produced bagpipes the next!
A woman wearing harem pants and a little top struts by with a jug on her head, then removes her face veil to expose a very ugly face.
The camel freaks out and starts playing bagpipes, then dances the Highland fling.
I'll admit, Porky isn't my favorite Looney Tunes character, and 4 1/2 minutes of the camel freaking out got to be a bit excessive for my taste - at first it was amusing, but then it started to drag and seemed like it wasn't going anywhere.
For instance, in the very first scene we see a couple of the locals, dressed in Mid-East garb, waking up, beginning to chant and then - wham!
Porky's camel (named "Humpty Bumpty") is delirious, hysterical and then thinks he's saved and begins playing bagpipes, doing an Irish dance, etc.
He continues beating you as the blood spurts out and you beg for mercy, then he beats you some more.
Sometimes they are the tool of a bad guy, used to lure Mike into a trap, then sent on their way.
If I understood it correctly (and I might not have done) then a very large quantity of gold was hijacked from a train in a tunnel, and then disappeared without trace.
If you are having trouble sleeping then this is the movie for you.
I'm not sure which, because by then I was giggling at McGoohan's mischievous performance.
While almost impossible to believe, the first man then realizes that the election is being held and he forgot to vote--and runs to the polls before they close.
PIE IN THE SKY might best be described as a collage of Brigid Berlin then and now.
But then, anyone who gives it an ounce of thought, can understand that the phrase "based on a true story" is not the same as "non-fiction".
Was Iraq called Iraq back then?
When _was_ then?
Some don't like what seems like stereotypes, however, it takes place in 1890 and Native Americans were killed, then played for sport in "shows".
If so, then the flick isn't a 10.
If this is seamlessly done, then all the better.
Turner asks for his share from the voluble Max, who pays him off then shoots him in the back.
Reno plays cards in Del Rey; breaking the house, then he forces a partnership onto the saloon's owner, planning to import "soiled doves", build a stage, cheapen the place.
York plays cards, badly, to show he is not the expert card player Turner was; then Kirby challenges him.
York enters, and by a fast draw, kills Kirby, then talks the mob out of a hanging.
Turner laughs with him, then slugs him on the jaw and settles in, to serve his sentence and return to Maria.
We then see Jay Turner (Sterling Hayden) and Max Reno (Ted de Corsia) riding horses along the surf and learn they are fleeing from a robbery.
He then takes both horses and flees.
Reno then shoots the man dead and gets away with claiming that the man drew on him.
He then rides back to the beach where he first encountered Maria and finds her pottering around the surf.
Ok this movie was interesting slow at first but then picked up of course I had a hard time even looking away from the screen because of Nancy Mckeon being the main character even crazy she looks cute :o) The movie is about a woman who seems normal then starts to hear voices she has schizophrenia.
The story line is simple but then I was a small child at the beginning of the war and all the movies were very simplistic.
Frost then led the parachute drop on Sicily and a further raid in Italy before his wartime career finished at Arnhem.
It contains all the old cliches like dying soldiers making a speech just before they draw their last breath and as soon as someone is tasked to do something dangerous they`ll do it in a completely blase manner then die in a blackly comical famous last words scene .There`s some corny dialogue from the American characters like " Holy cow , check out those crazy beefeaters " while the Brits are all stiff upper lipped .
If you enjoy a bad film and have enough people round to mock it, then see the film.
Akim Tamiroff as Welles' gypsy friend is rather good, but Nancy Guild in the dual role of Marie Antoinette and Lorenza, the woman who Cagliostro first rescues, then manipulates, is not outstanding.
Meryl Streep, who known more for being an excellent Academy Award winning actress then a beauty queen, was never more beautiful as well as classy as Brooke Reynolds, the mystery woman with a secret who knew much more then what she lead Dr. Rice to believe.
Streep is such a turn-on in the film that even with all her clothes on she had more sex appeal then both Britney Spear and Madonna put together with their clothes off.
I remember a couple of years ago when IFC or Sundance was running this film on an endless loop.At first I avoided it like the plague because I'd heard so many negative things like "it's boring" Or "all they do is talk"--but then I watched it anyway and saw that the great Wallace Shawn was one of the actors.How can I not watch a movie with him in it?And the other guy-I forget his name-was the evil bishop in Ladyhawke!
But then later he reverses himself and says that everything he has done is horrific and he is dubious about how he has lived his life for the past few years, feeling that he has squandered his life.
only then to have Wally present the case for the defense and thinking, "Wait a minute, this decision is not obvious."
I absolutely love movies that provoke thought, and this movies does exactly that, and then some.
It was easier to relate to Wallace as he enters the restaurant somewhat downtrodden, listens patiently to Andre's adventures, and then seems to find his spark when he responds to Andre's tale by saying that it seemed to him that all of Andre's exploits were an effort to strip away the purpose from his life in an attempt to experience life as "pure being".
But then something else even more important happens, which is that Gregory, and then by proxy Shawn, go into depths that are unexpected.
"), and then it becomes about both men, as men, having to come to grips with where they stand in their lives.
If you think this movie does a suitable job explicating the philosophical topics it pretends to discuss then you're probably an idiot.
And then it's up to the audience to insert meaning into otherwise insipid blathering.
I found myself waiting for something amazing or even slightly interesting to happen and then the credits rolled.
And then a dame enters the picture.
We might have some sympathy for Harold Dunlap at first, but then we realize he's dead serious about turning Mike into a corpse...and whom can Mike go to for help?
His anti-hero in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is tormented by the state in a new process to make him an acceptable (if defenseless) citizen, and then tormented by one of his old victims.
It starts with an injury to a young soccer player (McDowell) and then proceeds to show various stages in his mental adjustment to his permanent condition, the relationships he forms, and moves toward a powerful look at meaning and purpose in life beyond the difficulties we face, without minimizing those difficulties.
If you want intelligent eroticism then get Wild Things with Denise Richards, otherwise this will make a fun watch.
we have come away form the Edukators with completely different morals then the rest of the world.
If you felt that the diktators got help from the guy they kidnapped in order to get away and continue their work, then you're probably like me - part-hippie, part-revolutionary.
If you felt that the diktators merely predicted that the guy they kidnapped would call the police, then you're probably one of those upstanding citizens we all hear and read about.
I saw it for the first time at the Philadelphia Film Festival in February 2005, and have seen it about five times since then.
A very interesting, psychologically well developed film, that starts from the rather simple (the whole of the establishment are 'a wunch of bankers', as the British say) and then becomes more complex.
The development of the Hardenberg character was also very interesting: at first, he is a very rich top manager, also a rather pathetic figure, but then, as he gets in touch with his own idealistic past, he shows much strength and wisdom.
The story of the mÃ©nage Ã  trois vs. 'free love' also shows that young people then where even more radical than they are now...
But why the attack by the police - especially with anti-terrorist forces - was still necessary then, is quite beyond me.
The movie is essentially about three friends with seemingly no particular direction in life other than petty political activism now and then.
These directors have never let me down: I was addicted to their work when they did Thirtysomething some 15 years ago and since then have always been amazed by their subtle touch.
In other words, he becomes incredibly capable when the plotline requires it, then appears to be quite low functioning at other times.
Even here this is spoiled, for a start they're all pretty sub standard covers by other bands & even then we only get snatches.
A psychic predicts that a sultry young blonde will meet with tragedy on a train...A handsome young man murders his wife, then takes refuge in a sleepy small town...A young boy witnesses the murder but keeps it a secret...
Get a highly sensational subject like sex or violence, travel to a third world or developing country, roll the camera like its a home video and tape then edit against the will and intentions of the participants.
Harold ties him up and stuffs him in a closet then tells everyone that Mike ran away out the window.
I thought it was extremely fun, especially as we had to sit next to each other (I didn't have Internet nor the knowledge of LAN by then).
These two films, both with all black casts, showcase amazing talent often smothered by the then Hollywood studio system.
When we're told that the outlaw and his wife have been living in the mountains for years-- long enough to deliver and raise a baby who appears to be about three years old --then discover that they're still in the vicinity of Halla's former property, our credulity is strained.
And then, when they're cornered, Halla's sudden sacrifice of their child was inexplicable to me.
The matches are great and I think are better than WWE because since TNA is obviously a smaller company but a growing company then the wrestlers are going to go that extra mile for the fans and for their company.
Had it been able to do that, then I could say something nice about it!
Clearly time for a change of underpants then, because you know you really should be changing them every day.
**I don't know where to begin with this horrid harpy of a sequel that started a trend for the horror movie genre.How about the very idea of this film freddy is defeated in the first but in this time frame, new line was desperate for money and it shows.they thought why not make a sequel to the awesome movie we put out in 84.WE can make a completely illogical plot, stupid characters,the worst sequel in the franchise,bad acting from all the actors other then Robert Englund.This movie is probably best known for having the highest body count in the series.Usually that is a good thing in the original the deaths were unique and stylise.In this one they are just unoriginal in the first freddy would like write a cool message in you in this one you just get stabbed, or even worse that very brokeback scene with freddy in the shower whipping some dude.The plot sucks freddies trying to get reborn into the world by a whinny little kid, and only his neighbours love can save him?And it's got all kinds of bad special effects Wes Craven was probably ashamed of like that exploding bird,weird dog face things,the freddy coming through the kid seen,a better villain for this movie would have been that stupid school bus.It's got an unclimactic show off in the boiler room which set up part 3 which is a great movie.In conclusion if you buy the box set throw this out and part 5,6, and with 4 I don't care .Just stick with 1 3 and 7.
There is a start in this movie, but then all that happens is killing of the brain cell kind.
The acting is decent and the plot is good, but where this shines is the fact that its so unpredictable and the idea that freddy is inside jessie confused me at first but then grew on me and i became to feel sorry for the poor kid.
The film is hard to follow and strays heavily from the first film which is not the way a sequel should go but then again we are talking about the horror genre here.
Even then you will be disappointed.
But then we move.
And before Jesse had gone to a leather bar and had been literally kidnapped by the gay sports teacher and it is then later in the showers that Freddy again will kill this openly gay character from within the body of Jesse.
When Jesse (Mark Patton) first spies Freddy lurking in the back yard and then the basement being a prime example.
I mean the coach gets his ass whipped with a towel by Freddy (kinky bastard), Jesse ventures in a gay SNM bar, Jesse gets down with Lisa but then abruptly leaves her hanging to go sleep at Brady's house.
At least that is what you would think while you are watching the movie but then the acting is super.
It was then i realized that the movie was not at all what i expected it to be.
In all , i would sign off by saying, that if you are one of the people who appreciate movies like shawshank redemption , fight club, memento then DO NOT MISS ON THIS ONE.
But if you are the kind who likes masala movies and do not want to appreciate the direction of the movie then this one is not for you.
What would happen to people who lived then?
If they left later, then the attack force would have reached Pearl Harbor in time and messed up history.
If you loved Bullit, Gone in 60 Seconds, Mad Max, Christine, then you'll love this chase.
I know first time seeing it on the screen and it looked to be a huge drama, action-thriller or something in the beginning, and then suddenly the most unexpected thing happens.
It's good to see a woman taking the initiative like that in the movies, but then what do they do?
Now a film, (or more usefully), a series, where the ship doesn't go home but instead stops the attack and then deals with a crew that has to come to terms with living in a past where their irrevocably rewriting history... now that would be worth watching.
Will the captain order his men to attack the incoming Japanese force and thus change the course of history, or if not, what then?
If you like sci-fi, aircraft, and time-travel movies, then ignore the nay-sayers and watch this movie!
As it turns out, history in this film was changed in a minor way but then again... was it?
This ignores what the U.S. Government would have done once they got their hands on Nimitz and her technology back then!
And imagine the changes to history then!
A brace of Japanese Zeroes sink the yacht, killing two passengers which then prompts the carrier C.O.
Some of the best movies take one or two freak things and then play them out absolutely straight (e.g., Big, Back to the Future, Groundhog Day).
If we're busy doing that, then we won't hate the rich and powerful - the ones we should hate.
I really liked this show but then, i like most prison movies.
I hated it at first and then until i really watched it i fell in love with it.
It is definitely not a masterpiece, but if you need an evening of relaxation in front of the TV, then this film is for you.
I might have read more into it then was expected but maybe that was the goal.
The sex scene near the beginning of the film set that up, and then the introduction of a clandestine past and a family follow up on that promise, as well as does the introduction of a prostitute.
But then it goes the opposite way.
And then there is this weird attack on the house, especially on Kresten, on the same day as Gerner has attacked, by an entire brothel of prostitutes, Liva's friends from Copenhagen.
If you need cheering up or it's a rainy day then I recommend this film.
then there is Iben and Anders who is unbelievable good actors!
The pace can be maddenly slow, somewhat like the Unbearable Lightness of Being, with nothing much happening, just like real life, then POUNCE some momentous event lands out of the blue.
If you're even considering such an obscure movie as this, then you can probably tolerate a few flaws in an original movie.
A massive crew of hundreds disturbs the acting, disturbs the vibe, becomes the movie, rather then the film being the focus.
Somehow these larger and larger films just become money vampires for people to fill their bank accounts, rather then go to make something beautiful, as this.
You can understand that the actors felt comfortable and the whole thing came very naturally for them, rather then forced.
I can believe that a simple story is capable of being entertainment and moving, rather then great big complicated stories that consume the characters, and miss the mark.
First off i'd like to clarify that this is in no way a horror film, but purely a comedy for sick puerile freaks... hehehe :D  It only took me about 10 minutes to realize it was a stupid ass movie, and I have a rule where if its revealed to be total worthless trash before its a quarter done, then i just stop it and move on to something else, but in this case, it actually WAS somewhat amusing and at a running time of only 80 minutes i figured "why not" It may be low budget, but it shines through as your typical drunken party movie.
at the 50 minute mark  It can in no way scare or shock, as the corpses in every case are obviously fake, and even though a legless 1 armed girl is sexually exploited and then snuffed, shes slutty, bitchy, and doesn't exist as a character but has the on screen presence of a self aware plot device.
.....good then I'm still sssexy" (I was quoting, not paraphrasing) Honestly, even Jesus or the Dalai Lama wouldn't be inspired to feel ANYTHING for the characters on screen.
As it is, I can even see a fringe group being proud to own a copy, so If you decide to watch this movie thats one thing... but if you took the time to read this long ass review about it, and if you're a crude sick freak... then you HAVE to watch it, if only to avoid long ass reviews on movies such as "dark harvest."
John Waters used to make movies like this, before he succumbed to the Hollywood dollar(s), but it's few and far between since then.
But if you like variety, and need to decompress from the above choices now and then, fire up the bong, and open the six pack, and take the dirt road off the mainstream highway to CHEERLEADER AUTOPSY.
It takes the archetypal "teens in trouble" formula but then twists the familiar plot into a powerful and unsettling existential psycho-horror story.
I didn't know what to make off it back then, but with my recent viewing it has kinda hit the mark.
None of it distracts, but gives it a sense of realism and a more then believable rapport between the characters.
They played cousins who were like brothers so I liked it that they resembled each other.Brad's mom near the beginning of the movie made a reference to this and I thought it was a nice change having 2 of them being related other then having your typical 4 friends.
I thought all the actors were believable and the movie was very well acted.It was such a nice change to see an Australian film.It was a disturbing film but in a different way then wolf creek was.It really got me thinking a lot.It makes you wonder if this scenario does or could happen if you are in limbo.Their souls all ended up back at the creepy beach and only Emily seemed to have figured out what had happened.It was tense watching her convince the other's what had happened to them.
I was a huge fan of this show, saw every episode, and then all of a sudden it went off the air!
I don't fault how things are now or were then.
I don't fault how things are now or were then.
This gives me the impression that I am looking in on a week or so of several lives as they meet and then go their separate ways.
Little physical gestures like the way that Taylor's Driver stops to hear love-making in a motel room, stands by the door a moment partially frozen, and then sits with knees folded to the chest for what would appear to be quite a while.
Develpoed quite a cult following and thanks for the support of me (at the time just a new AF model) then and in my career that has followed.
The plot was about a hit-man in New York City hitting the wrong target and then deciding to protect the right target as a means of penance.
In the book she woke up and Gitl was making bread, Shmuel was there and they were talking, then Gitl helped Chaya(Hannah) get ready for Fayge's(Leah) and Shumuel's wedding.
Or the woman who set her apartment on fire, then sued her landlord.
certainly he seems to be struggling to keep up with Cook's genius, but then i've always felt Cook was the more talented.
If however you are a teenager or twenty something looking for some hilarity then call round your mates, get them to bring round pizza and beer and you have the recipe for an unforgettable evening.
This film is a masterpiece of filth, it's so funny, if you hate the political correctness that we live in today then rush out and buy this.
If any "film" ought to be blasted off into space for aliens from the planet Z to find and watch, then this is it.
Trust me its way better then that.
mother let a man and drugs take over her life over such beautiful pure unconditional love from her kids.what a waste she is,but LOVE the actress Anne Heche around my age mid to late thirties i think,love her the type of ostensible parent like her who drink alcohol getting wasted all the time or drunk drugs etc should be in JAIL.to then let a man some loser guy druggie,etc.
This film was tailor made for the Ailurophobe: if you believe that cats have a hidden agenda and possibly even a secret plan to take over the world then you really cannot miss this movie.
It wouldn't have been a great film then, but that would have been enough for a much better movie.
If you can handle watching a disturbing, strange, disconnected family (and not in a good/funny way), a squirmingly bad kid actor, some very ugly cats, sloppy editing, and as many cliches as you could ever want, then go see this movie.
Jurrasic Park Jeff Goldblum didn't have much of a role other then being inventor of the cure.
The Jewish league should sue for being shamelessly exploited in a bad TV movie and get whatever profits came from this movie, then give anyone who voted higher than a 2 for this movie a free trip to the Holocaust Memorial in Washington DC, Auschwitz, the Wiesenthal Center or the Imperial War museum.
If you're too young to understand the violence of the event then wait till you're older.
If you want to see secret agent dogs fighting Devon Rex's ninja style, a knife throwing Russian Blue hair-balling big style and a gigantic army of mice reading an instruction manual, all at once, on how to concur the world then this is the movie for you.
I think this is the best movie ever cause when i first saw halloweentown i totally loved it and then when i saw halloweentown 2:Kalabar's Revenge i totally loved it too.
and if you haven't seen the first halloweentown then you probably won't understand halloweentown 2:Kalabar's Revenge.
If ever any one was born to play Don Juan then it was Flynn.
But now and then the film gets a little bogged down with some palace intrigue until the picture's famous set piece - the brilliantly staged sword-fight on the magnificent palace staircase.
The Rabbia or righteous wrath of the title is mostly also left to viewers back then or now, and maybe it didn't get rooted.
If Matt Helm is the world's last hope in recovering one billion in stolen gold, then we're in big trouble.
I thought that the book was better then the movie.
That's why i think that the book was a lot better then the movie.
Office fool Charley at first gets the tricks played on him with mixed humorous results, then he turns the tricks on others only to have them backfire.
One of the best gags is the very first one, when the office boy puts tacks in all the chairs and everyone sits simultaneously --and then jumps up simultaneously.
Sweepers however was a huge letdown, it starts brightly enough the whole opening scenes on the minefield are pretty cool and after the 'Roadhouse' style bar-fight scenes i thought i was in for a good time...then it all goes wrong.
Ron Perlman was one of the worst dramatic actors I've ever seen, my pug could have recited the lines and been more believable then he was.
It's then that Pollack, and what's left of his crew, tries to make his way back to Anchorage, or civilization, before he and everyone else with him ends up dead!
No, it's not as good as The Thing, but then few movies are.
The 'monsters' aren't great but then they aren't really that important to the overall plot.
If you are not a gore fest carnage freak then this is a film for you
But then a lot of possibilities are thrown away.
After paying $10.00 for this movie and then setting and watching it for a 101 minutes, I ended up wasting money and time.
If you need it to be categorised, then imagine Kubrick's The Shining, crossed with Carpenter's The Thing, mixed up with Fessenden's own Wendigo sauce.
Just before you'd walk out of the cinema or fall asleep in your chair somebody finally gets killed (couldn't tell you who, despite all that build up), then they go mad/off themselves/get killed/whatever in quick succession.
I think then it could be a lot better than with the directors imagination leading nowhere.
If this last movie is as good as the others then I know it will be worth the money I spend to buy it and I can add it to my collection.
If you are a Don Juan and Migel fan then I know you too will enjoy these movies.
But it is a touching film and excellent education for people to understand what it was like then.
Overall, the individuals that thought this was a good idea and created it should be shaved, shot, and then exterminated with extreme prejudice as crimes against humanity!!!
This must be buried in the deepest bowels of the earth, covered by feces, a layer of lead, and then a generous portion of cement.
Seen very much from a young child's point of view, it shows nothing in the beginning but then starts to develop itself with a great potential.
Since then I've watched it many times and the story is always entertaining due to its uniqueness.
And he then hired Alfred Newman to write a new score and BAM, what an improvement it made!
Perhaps the story needs a somewhat more ironic and cynical touch, then, rather than endorsing Sapt's agenda without question?
But then, one would have needed to cast someone like Errol Flynn as Rupert, and, fun though he is in swashbucklers, I'm not sure that would have worked.
The start of the movie develops the film's premise and then the characters.
Today the loves scenes seem a bit dated BUT back then actors in a clinch did not look at one another, the camera had to catch there faces.
The scenes in which he faces himself onscreen Â called `trick photography' then Â are remarkable for the period.
And of what it could and should be, now and then, even today.
With such an outstanding, marquee cast that lives up to its advanced billing and then some, it is not difficult to understand why this film was such a rousing success when it premiered in 1937; so successful, in fact, that it was copied verbatim by MGM 15 years later after it purchased the rights from Selznick.
I can't root for people who keep doing the wrong thing, hurting each other, then possibly hurting innocent people who trusted them.
Steve (Russell Crowe) and Monica (Salma Hayek) talk about that they are not together anymore but still hop into bed with one another and then talk and argue until one of them leaves.
Woven through the mystery, and then the magic of the tale is the common child's lament, "no one ever listens to me, no one ever believes me".
overall, if your looking to tell/show a group of preteen/teens the story of the holocaust without the brutality then this is the ONLY movie to show them.
I did not get the chance to see this film in the theater , however, I saw it on cable and then purchased the tape.
We then see the kid on the shore and when he sees his sister he tries to flee, perhaps horrified at his sister's acting ability.
The film then, should not be taken as a documentary on the holocaust (there are plenty of those around with far more realistic (and gruesome) pictures).
and then proceeds to place both feet in his mouth, should bother to read a bit of Irish folklore.
I didn't realize it was a John Sayles movie until I saw his name on the credits and then I thought it might be something different; I don't associate Sayles with simple family movies.
then your skills at this game need work.
to summerize this film is pretty lousy but its does have a unique take on buddy movie cliches and is better then most films cliches.instead of one's black and the other white or one's a ticking time bomb and the other is as wise cracking street cop or one's a suicidal partner and the other is danny glover or one's a dog and the other is a human or one is a couch cushion and the other is a blender in this movie one's an arrogant son of a bitch and the other is a whiny annoying mess.
I do understand that this also is an important part of Madonna's life, but some of the footage you get to see is so hard and depressing that it leaves more impact then the 100 minutes before.
this scene also involved drawers of a dresser opening and shutting on their own, bloody body limbs flying around the room, and a painting of a laughing cat that came to life and then starting spewing blood.
The pace is fast-fast-fast and then slow for a little, then BANG there it goes again.
One of those once in a life-time moments, when you will laugh so hard you p*#s yourself, and then c*&p your pants from being stunned by sheer cinematic prowess.
If you really must compare this to any other films, then rank it alongside the weirdest cinematic experiments ever made, like "El Topo", "I Walk like a Crazy Horse" and "Possession".
Agatha Christie style, the girls then subsequently meet their highly imaginative deaths one by one.
It's about the time the floating head appears, followed by the girl-eating piano, and then the malevolent cat spirit that gushes blood, and the carnivorous lamp.
Combine the production values with a children's movie feel, then combine that with some blood, violence and nudity, you get a very different hybrid genre of a flick.
So now she lives in this big house all by herself (with a strange long-haired cat the girls call Snowball) and when the girls arrive, things at first seem idyllic, but then change as the girls start to meet with odd fates, one by one.
If you're expecting a serious comedy, then you will undoubtedly be disappointed.
If you want a film to change the world then keep sending Michael Moore your money.
Also, if you loved this movie and it's stellar array of stars, then you'll love the sequel.
And then they'll have you!
See this movie, and then rent some of the classic skits by Caesar, Reiner, Coca, Morris and company on DVD.
Put simply, GitS SAC makes most mainstream sci-fi adoptions look like a fluke (The Matrix included)If you're the kind who likes cheeky humor and silly big eyed characters then GitS SAC then you're barking at the wrong tree.
however if you care for Plausibilty and Realism while watching and, want your Anime to be serious, then Your humble Quest has ended.
I watched the entire series 1 and 2 whilst I was supposed to finish my thesis - nagging deadlines, raging teachers and what not could not dissuade me from watching this first, then finish my Master's degree - one has to set priorities!
if you want insight into the sacrifices and rewards necessary to survive, starting with genuine loyalty topped off with a huge dollop of FORGIVENESS then watch this film.
But, if you are tired of standard Hollywood fare where everyone is either Hugh Grant or Sandra Bullock, then give this little movie a chance.
I just love the scene where he puts his lathi (staff) into the bullet wound of one of the villain's son and then twists it before taking it out.
Passing through, they are spirited at first to World War Two, then to a scientific base at the South Pole in the year 1990, followed by a parallel universe where global warming has turned England into a sub-tropical paradise, and finally to the 1960's.
The show was intelligently scripted, firstly by Bruce Stewart, then Victor Pemberton ( author of the 'Dr.Who' classic 'Fury From The Deep' ).
Did you hear a noise just then .
It works then as an entertainment but it has one of the greatest endings of any film.
If you like France and its mentality, then this movie is for you.
I understand that this was created entirely in 3D and then forced to look 2D but I think the process is similar to using a nuclear bomb to kill a fly - which may be the next adventure of Hoverboy.
Let's face it, if you're truly looking for a good movie, then you KNOW from the title that this isn't likely to be the answer.
Oh, yeah, Ivan also had a dog that lived in the closet, and he kept kicking the closet door every now and then to shut the beast up.
During "I am the very model of a modern Major General" he conjures a bouquet of flowers from his anus and hands them to one of the Fatuous Singlettes with the remark: "Put those in some water and then wash your hands".
I loved it then and I love it now.
Back in the 70s i had to have seen all those party movies , for example, The Van and The Gas Pump Girls, and lifeguard was so much of a breath of fresh air along side of those others, i grew up hanging out at redondo beach and Hermosa beach California which is where this movie was filmed, in fact on ricks tower u see the letters HR i believe that stands for Hermosa/redondo and this is also 1 of the beaches that mike love and Dennis Wilson of the beach boys used to hang out at as they lived in near by Hawthorne, I have this movie on VHS not available on DVD yet, and I watch it at least once a month, as i live in new york now and this movie brings back some special memories of my fun days, i even love that song time and tide in this movie, and watching him drive to the beach in his stingray passing all those very familiar businesses, wow, well if your nostalgic then i don't have to explain the feeling.
The third entry in the series, then, gave the formula an ingenious twist by marrying it with the popular old dark house-type of film.
For the record, the best gag has Rochester falling repeatedly through a hole in the ground to the riverbed beneath the old house, and then being persistently kept from re-emerging by a playful seal!
Lots of support in this one for Young and Burke as the old, spooky haunted house genre serves as primary backdrop when Topper goes to the scene of the crime and then we get mixed identities, hidden panels, scores of red herrings pointing out everyone's guilt except for the killer but generously dosed with lots of amusing quips from Young, wise-cracking one-liners from Blondell in ghostly form, by-play between Burke and her maid, the underrated Patsy Kelly, and chauffeur/fraidy cat Eddie "Rochester" Anderson basically playing himself and hamming it up as only he can.
You sometimes think that family problems are more of a modern thing of today - but back then they had their fair share of family upheaval, back stabbing and murder in mind.
Silas, with the help of Caroline's ex-governess (Katina Paxinou) plan to get rid of Caroline, since the inheritance then passes to him.
Unfortunately, I didn't have a VCR back then and so I couldn't record it.
The films title was changed to "The Inheritance" and a scene where Uncle Silas has Dudley propose marriage to Caroline had been cut by the censures (incest was taboo in American cinema back then).
Uncle Silas then forces Dudley to leave the house only to sneak him back later in the wee hours of the morning.
It expanded from 6 or 8 theaters, then, with perhaps 5,000 seats, to several times this number today, with more seats than all of Broadway.
They also have all the information about characters upon whom the book is based, and Harold Bell Wright, that one could possibly want to know (and then some!).
They didn't work together again for another 19 years and then in the Sixties did four films culminating with Wayne's Oscar winning performance in True Grit.
And then thing are getting very hot.
And then, for the rest of his days, live in the eternal guilt of killing his son & in the Moral Dilemma of whether he FOLLOWED Dharma, or DEFIED Dharma.
What then stops the film from being an engrossing entertainer or a classic art film?
It is then upto Prince Harshwardhan (Saif Ali Khan), Eklavya and Sanju the brash and witty cop to seek revenge and justice and a very sweet'n'syrupy family reunion.
But then the palace hides a lot of truth inside it.
But then there are some peoples who are not too happy.
Actually he did give a sign of a grand finale with Harshwardhan's (Saif Ali Khan) gesture which if Mr Chopra has stayed with then this tale would have made sense and fit to all of the character's intentions.
VVD has a goldmine of a storyline here but he fails to mine it: we could have easily seen more of Big B's doubts about dharma, more of Saif Ali Khan's uneasy steps on the path of palace intrigue and treachery, more of Dutt's feeling as a scheduled caste DSP involved in outdated monarchical madness,more of Shroff's agitation as the king's younger brother - the story now is told in such a way that it leaves you guessing too much at what the characters would be going through, so that at the climax you recognize: this would have been a heart-breaking tragic scene of more then epic proportions, if only you would have felt more...  So,all in all, a good performance and a great visual tour of Rajastan - but not the brilliant movie you can easily understand it could have been.
But then Eklavya is no disappointment.
He appears to say that was then, in the past, there's no time for that; let's simply watch how their karmic debts are collected now.
Every now and then, there is a moment of stillness, which one wishes would be held a few seconds longer for the mood to be savored.
If you like crazy, wacky comedies then you'll love this one.
Well if simple means complex then this movie is simple.
And if this simple means simple then this movie is NOT simple.
Well if I told you then it would take all the fun out of the movie ;) The musical score in this movie treats you to a John Williams type experience as if you are listening to the Indian Jones theme for the first time.
The main character is so cheesy, so depressed and brooding, suspicious of everything and then suddenly happy-go-lucky, not a care in the world.
She refers to herself as a cop, but then plays the part of an arson investigator with the fire department.
Like most truly good films some people won't get it, but if you understand the plot then trust me you'll enjoy it.
Virginia was very sexy as the young unsuspecting student who investigates the murders of people of a murdered black slave who has a hook for a hand who lures his victims with candy but its really wrapped-up razors and then splits them wide open with his hook.I have said Candyman 5 times in the mirror and nothing happened!
Helen herself then becomes part of the legend and therefore comes back as another physical manifestation of legend.
The film is very well written in terms of creating sympathy for Neville and then bit by bit deconstructing his character.
The movie itself was a mixed bag, even then.
As in The Omega Man, we now see the mass media that is a product of science used by that media's own opportunistic elements to generate a hostility to science that they can then play to their own advantage.
Quick-paced & tense with good supporting performances from Paul Koslo as "Dutch" & Rosalind Cash as "Lisa" Dated now it is, but still stands the test of time as a truly great 70's sci-fi & if you haven't seen it, then you are in for a treat.
There was some good suspense as the lead character and Shapeshifter gets introduced, but then the film got bogged down.
OK fine.. then he starts summoning, OK... not bad, then it drags out into a non-demon, shapeshifter that gets stronger when it eats flesh, yet still part of some occult plot according to our on-screen expert, some jailhouse nutbag that suddenly offers all of the 'dirt' to shovel into all the plot-holes.
And then you wake up, except the writers never did for this stupid nutshell...
If you want to see a low-budget, amateur movie with some talent then see The Revenge of Bloody Bill.
The beast then tries to get the other prisoners but can't due to the bars either side of him.
The film then loops back to the beast ripping up the mans stomach again and chowing down on his intestines!!!!!!!!
In fact, he brings an almost fey quality to the early scenes and then gains more heft as the uncomfortable situation comes closer to home.
If more effort had been put in this movie (not by the actors, they were finaminal in their roles) then perhaps this movie would've been more than just an HBO run-by.
I know it's one of those silliest things a person can do after watching a movie but then when I saw the final credit, it's a made-for-TV movie from HBO.
Now maybe I am not of marriageable age yet, but then standing up to whatever your friend had did is one thing I am clearly aware about.
Toni Collette's Beth is an enigma until her confrontation with Karen at the restaurant, then, we see a woman that is not shy in telling her best friend off as she embarks in a new relationship.
They marry at about the same time, each have two kids, they spend a lot of time together, *best* friends... And then, one of them split up.
Well it does, but I expected a little more then a headshot.
If you like feel good movies about the elderly, then I would recommend this film.
I have been trying since then to watch it again, but i could not get a copy.
I was searching in the inter net when suddenly I saw it and then your website came up, so I decided to log in and sign in as a member.
Finding out about their attachment, Soames uses his financial power against Bossinney, who grows distraught and then is killed in a street accident.
Like Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot [another weirdo dick], big Nero likes to gather all the suspects' together and tell each one how the caper went down and then name the guilty party.
To have a motley of soldiers (no tracking shot to show how few extras are actually being used) carrying the same East Indian Co. flag as a battle flag as opposed to what by then amounted to a Tesco banner was something else that didn't seem right to me.
And then he's summoned to the Duke of Wellington's home in London.
If you missed it, and want to find out whether or not Harper survives, after all Sharpe is a good shot, the best, then the DVD is out at the beginning of May!
So they got this great idea, they expanded it into an interesting mini series, and then left it open ended.
If you like Stephen King movies then this is the show for you.
Without giving anything away I will just say that if you were intrigued by the ideas in such movies as Donny Darko, Contact, 2001 Space Oddysey (or the 2001/2010/3000 books) then you will enjoy this show.
Many of these shows go David Lynch/Twin Peaks on us, setting us up with the promise of great stuff to come, and then disappointing us in a big way later.
I suppose if a film can do that then happy days.
Nikita then becomes domesticated and settles in with a sweet boyfriend, Marco (Jean-Hugues Anglade).
(an acronym for "Finding Inspiration in Movies and Literature") includes a three step process in which children screen select films, use activity guides for each film, and then partake in service learning projects.
If you have any ability to follow how these types of movies go, then you will know the outcome long before it happens... it doesn't matter because you'll be wanting that outcome and you'll embrace it when it happens!!!
If you take it seriously then you will hate this movie.
This Stooges short is a very good one and I love the performance by Stanley Blystone.The Stooges are very funny Half-Shot Shooters.The explosions are excellent especially for the time period.If you like the Stooges then I think you'll love this!
It then cuts to the Stooges, laying together in a ditch, sleeping through the battle.
Its plot Â starting in WWI and then moving on to the present (1935, in this case) Â anticipates one of Laurel & Hardy's best feature-films, BLOCKHEADS (1938).
Show me something rather then explain it with one line of dialog.
Anyway felt more like an hour long TV episode rather then a movie.
When TV was in it's infancy, material like this was readily available on the Ed Sullivan show, the Jackie Gleason show, and many other classic programs, and for those of us who grew up watching TV in an era when they would only broadcast for about 12 hours per day because there was not enough material available to fill an entire 24-hour schedule, then you will be very happy to see this type of stuff once again.
The first segment of this film is a bit like a "coming of age" story that's probably a bit racier than most of its type, but then it morphs into Harry as a teenager, with hideous acne and wanting to stay away from others because of his horrible complexion.
We then pick up a few years later and Henry is a schoolboy, befallen by an extreme case of acne that leads to him being rejected by the opposite sex and ridiculed by his peers.
Since then I've decided that I'll try to see all his other movies as well and this "Crazy Love" is the first step into the right direction.
And then he comes up with that excellent idea which allows him to dance with the girl of his dreams.
We see his hero, Harry Voss, first as a romantic young boy of 12, then as an acne ridden teenager, lost in unrequited love, and finally as a drink sodden drop out, for whom no act is too dreadful to contemplate...with terrible and yet deeply moving consequences.
I just saw it again tonight, though I remember seeing it a couple times when I was a kid--and even back then I was amazed at Steve McGarrett's awesomeness.
The direction shows style and promise and an attention to detail I respected then and respect now.
So I guess if you enjoy this, then you may like the movie, but I personally couldn't follow who was fighting for who from one scene to the next.
The scene then quickly changes to a chaotic montage in which images of some of the 20th century's most brutal dictators are flashed across the screen, including Stalin, Hitler, Tojo Hideki, and Benito Mussolini.
He himself seems to feel that something is right, rather then have it all worked out in his mind logically.
About 30 seconds into this, is a film clip of some teacup ride at some crappy amusement park, then EXPLOSION!
IZO then comes back to life (though years later in the movie) and starts killing everyone.
It's got a really deep plot (if you want that sort of thing), but it's easy to ignore, so if you just want random violence then sit back, ignore the dialog and focus on the 100+ murders that occur in this movie.
He STABS the groom, then slaughters the bride!
He then jumps through a wall, but travels through some kind of portal into a classroom.
Izo- My Takashi Miike run ends with Izo, the story of one of Japans most legendary and bloody assassins, at the beginning of the film he is crucified and pierced repeatedly with spears, he spends the rest of the film warping through time and space at random, having ethical and metaphysical discussions with and then killing virtually everyone he crosses, including Buddah and mother earth herself as he searches for a reason for his curse, which renders him unkillable and unable to control his location.
These songs may seem strange but they really do help break up the monotony of the endless waves of violence, and oblique dialog, as well as more often then not mirroring and adding emotional depth to the actions of the at turns stoic and demonic Izo(who was based on an actual samurai Lord, who was known for his violence).
Even then, Miike backs up the killing with the statement: "History is built on bloody events, so why wouldn't I kill to find answers?"
Izo kills some people for about two hours, and then the film ends.
Like other "journey" films (LOTR, for example) it is episodic - Izo goes somewhere and does something, then goes somewhere else and does something else.
Its that sort of a movie and then some.
and then for the next two hours he runs around killing people and being or being the subject of "deep" discussions in various times and places.
(The problem is he's not giving many clues as to what he's trying to say)  Think of it as Jodorowsky's El Topo combined with his Holy Mountain, then turned into a time traveling samurai flick as filtered through the mind of a genius prankster.
If you have plans, then set your TIVO... it is completely worth it!
The first girl then decides that she made a mistake so she tries to get back with the boy.
The then 18-year old Silvana Mangano's earthy performance will endure forever.
Next to her, the other main stars fade aside: Gassman, then the brightest young star of Italian theater, is devilishly handsome and virile, but tends to overact (but we get a glimpse of what his Stanley Kowalski must have been on stage).
If suddenly we were told that yes there was a crash of an alien spacecraft in New Mexico in 1947 then the world would go into a frenzy.
Sick and dying Jesse want's to finally get to the bottom of what happened back then and make it public before he dies and tries to get as much information from the soldiers airmen and civilians who were there and knows what happened but have been too afraid to talk about it all these years.
At the reunion Jesse finally gets to the truth about what happened from many of those who were involved in the investigation and the cover up of the evidence at Roswell, as well as those UFO investigators who were investigating it then in 1977.
What's positive about the "Incident at Roswell" is that those in charge of finding out what happened, then as well as now, will never let it see the light of day.
If you are an skeptic who really doesn't care about the subject at all, then you will find little, or no entertainment value here.
Jade then inherits the freak show, and runs it with a cold heart, in contrast to Steve, who considered the freaks close friends of his.
If you like to see people on rides whilst real bad music plays in the background for what seems an eternity, then She Freak is for you.
The story moves incredibly slow for an hour and twenty minutes, then the freak show owner dies, Jade reveals herself as the bitch she is, and the freaks take their revenge- all in the last five minutes.
They saved all the interesting stuff for the end, and then just rushed through it.
The freaks take their revenge on Jade by gluing a googly eye to her face and making her wear a Mr. Spock ear, and then spraying her with silly string.
The film then goes into flashback as the barker begins his story.
The main character, Jade, starts the movie as a bitch, then is re-introduced as a sympathetic character with high hopes, then spends the rest of the movie bouncing back and forth.
Tongans serve today as missionaries, of their own free will, as enthusiastic and committed as Groberg was then.
If you're looking for an inspiring story that gets you asking what's really important in life, then you may put this on your ten-best list.
It was hilarious when Alicia tied herself up then locking herself in the trunk.
Anyway the fight scene with them is great, I love how as they stick together they gradually become friends, then well you can probably guess but I wont say.
Granted, since Hollywood was funding it, they probably have a different opinion then I do!
I think that the film is well made...good acting, nice sets, good directing, but has an awful script.It is inspired by true events...I know...but then so are a lot of WW2 films...that doesn't mean that "poetic license" is not involved here.If in the WW2 films "poetic license" means political points of view...(he who wins the war writes the history (Churchill's was a genius!
It's interesting though that it sheds light on the Mormon doctrine, rites and such, as well as the inner church bureaucracy.It is a very good effort, starting a bit shy, not saying anything about the religious aspect, then less and less shy until it really becomes very enlightening on these matters.This is not my first Mormon film, I saw another one, more interesting, "The princess and the Marine", about an Arabian princess being saved by a Mormon GI-Joe from her native country.I liked it very much.
But back then, Home Economics was a woman's choice, until her husband ordered her to quit her job and stay at home (tee-hee).
Hell, back then women could only vote in 4 of 46 states!
Basically its just bad, but I have to think for something to be so bad then logically it must be good?
Overall I would say if you are a fan of Baywatch then you will enjoy this movie and should definitely watch it.
If you aren't a fan however then I would still suggest you watch it because it really is a bad movie, but because of that it's entertaining and fun so give it a go.
It was incredible and moving and, if you are not touched by their stories, then you are cast in stone.
Some, among them is a half-Jewish gay resistance fighter who posed as a Hitler Youth member to rescue his lover from a Gestapo transfer camp in an ultimately futile effort; Annette Eick, the Jewish lesbian who escaped to England with the help of a woman she loved; the German Christian photographer who was arrested and imprisoned for homosexuality, then joined the army on his release because he "wanted to be with men" and Pierre Seel, the French Alsatian teenager, who watched as his lover was eaten alive by dogs in the camps.
It was incredible and moving and, if you are not touched by their stories, then you are cast in stone.
The basic story is about a drugged up vicious street punk serving a life sentence for killing a cop.She is given a second chance at freedom of sorts, by a top secret French assassination agency.The movie shows her transformation into something better then she was and the affect it has on the two men in her life that mean something to her.
I was a bit put off by some of the negative comments, but it is always interesting to then view a film which is praised by some and despised by one or two.
Stopping first with a tribe that has had contact with the modern world, they then move on to find an undiscovered group.
They strip one guy down to his bvds and then stop as if for modesty reasons.
They then proceed to get into a raft accident.
Rita and Bobby's guide is killed in the usual bad spike trap, and they're then captured by the same cannibal tribe they were looking for and face various "tortures," including the most pathetic attempted rape ever committed to film (although there was one noteworthy scene of a cannibal gets his testicles smashed with a mallet).
Rita and Bobby escape by being quiet and tip-toeing out of the village, and then find Tommy.
C: A scene of the cannibals having circled around the hero and then attacking him one-at-a-time, and him defending himself with karate moves!
Despite the fantasy element, and even fantasy-within-fantasy (the mermaid couldn't talk and then learned English after one day at Bloomingdale's ?)
It is a light romantic comedy, with a young Tom Hanks, lonely, going through life with mismatched relationships, until by chance he meets a mermaid.........and then the film progresses from there.
Because then the parallel with 'Dracula' would be complete.
However; if paedophilia, bestiality, and betrayal are your idea of the ingredients for a good romance, then keep taking the tissues.
I remember growing up watching this movie.I loved it then and still do.
I saw it in the there shortly after it came out, fell in love with it and through the years have watched it more times then I can remember.
I mean, what kind of a movie has a woman go into labor while gyrating in a Santa Claus suit then show her give birth to a one-armed baby, get abandoned by her married lover, watch as her stepmother breast-feeds the one-armed baby, abandons said baby, finds her long-lost mother (who it turns out is a schizophrenic), learns that one-armed baby is in a coma... all in about 15 minutes.
This is the story of a young professional vertical skateboarder named Mark Rogowski - who went on to earn the nickname "Gator" after inventing a skate-style move all his own - the "Gaite - Aire" And then , later still dropping his last name Rogowski - which he was quoted as saying that the name itself belonged to his father , who was not present in his life.
So then he was "Gator" Mark Anthony , which are his birth first and middle names.
He was then promoted by many large name skateboard & parts companies.
As reflected in its subtitle, "Stoked" is not an original idea about a talented individual attaining success then losing it.
'Porky's Romance' is a film that aims to make audiences laugh, cry and wince in equal measure as we empathise with the nightmare of Porky's heartbreak and then the even more horrific glimpse at the possibilities of married life (a slightly sexist representation by today's standard but this was the 30s!).
It is funny, and then heartbreaking if anyone's life would turn out like his dream.
Porky then wakes up to decide whether he still wants his dream girl.
Porky then walks off heartbroken.
She then pigs out, big-time, on the candy.
Silverstone plays a very cute spoiled rich girl who just wants some attention from her father, so she fakes a kidnapping, then locks herself in her own car.
After enjoying The Plumber by Peter Weir,i hoped that this would be as good (or better) then that movie,sadly it came nowhere near being that.
Back then I wondered (like others) about the title, the plot & what it was all about.
Arthur being ceremoniously ordained as a parking officer then having a showdown with the local hoons (with a spaghetti western-ish soundtrack in the background).
They then salvage the car and possessions of the killed drivers.
The whole town assists in deliberately causing accidents and then use the parts and accessories as currency to buy stuff in the shops.
Drugs, money,alchocol,weapons communism poisoned my country then milosevic killed it.
This shows while it then had an American version, but it's not worth it.
This is the story of one whole generation, a kids just few years younger then me (1972), who have grown up in time and place where most of values ware lost.
In this film you'll see the sort of things you see when you quick-empty a bottle of vodka and then go and start a civil war.
The last lines of Pinki, when there is no more picture, only darkness left, and he dies when he said: "A sve mi se nesto cini, da sam prosao bolje od vas" or in translation: "I still have a weird feeling, that I came through better then you."
As for the "experimental approach", if every other movie that Italians (and other Continentals) release has the same type of surreal silliness going on, then it isn't really experimental anymore, is it?
I spoke to a couple of people after the film who said they thought they would be uncomfortable with the subject and were for a couple of  minutes but then became totally involved and forgot.
It started out as soft port then a horror flick and finally an action sequence.
You have got to admire a movie that sets and then surpasses its own goals.
), try on the new Fall lineup of underwear, then accidentally open a "soul box" containing the spirit of Hockstetter, the notorious "sorority house killer" (last seen in Wynorski's similar SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE 2).
Not too much love scene, then the scene the next morning by the lake was touching.
he says "You" and then Dave Matthews starts playing "Crash Into Me"...perfect song, then he goes to kiss her and he does that "come on, come on, come on, come on, come on" thing...and they close the trunk.
You won't hate it then!
CAUTION -- MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS --  I put this film roughly in the same category as "Pleasantville" and "The Truman Show", in that they require you to suspend disbelief to show how, ultimately, it is better to really live and love then die, rather than live a "perfect" and protected life.
Andrew first asks to be made to look like a human, so is given a human-looking covering, which then has him looking like Robin Williams.
(Funny scene, in bed with Portia, his stomach growls, then he farts, is surprised, says "I'll need to have him make me a muffler.")
He goes before the "world council", and on his and Portia's deathbeds, sees via TV that he is finally "human", then he dies, and Portia asks the nurse to "pull the plug."
The only real failings were the large gaps in time and how Andrew came about - but then it's difficult to compress 200 years into 1 1/2 hours.
If you enjoyed Azimov's books as much as I did, then this movie is for you.
If you are looking for a high action movie with robots then you have come to the wrong place.
If you are looking for a sci-fi based romantic comedy about the personal growth of one man...er robot, then this is the movie.
If you ever wanted to be more than you are then watch this film.
The season opener is Love Boat Angels which is really cool, and then they have more episodes in Hawaii.
I would also like to add, that if you base watching the films on the programmes then you might be disappointed.Although the general idea is still there, the modernised version has certainly made it more male orientated with a lot of the scenes, especially the "Bay Watch" scene in film two.
Farrah Fawcett was the next to join; filling the blonde role, but then the producers dropped the hair color concept and brought in Jaclyn Smith to complete the trio.
I started watching it during the third season, then Kate Jackson left.
By the third season, the producers and everyone else involved (sans the actresses) figured that because the ratings had not slipped, then the success of the show had nothing to do with quality, because the third season's episodes were mostly not very good, sometimes pretty bad.
Incredibly popular, it all came down to Farrah and her 70's fly away hair, her dazzling toothy smile, her skateboarding pose wearing Addia's, her shampoo, her toothpaste, THE bathing suit poster of the century, and then she was gone.
Bolstered by Jill's kid sister, Kris (Cheryl Ladd) and then others, Charlie's Angels never again climbed to the heights of sheer madness of its first season.
Instead of Ms. Stanwyck either going on the offensive to get this dog of a man to take responsibility for his actions OR just leaving and starting a new life and considering this a learning experience, she runs away very briefly and then returns to "business as usual".
And then, when they are caught together by the press, Barbara agrees to pretend to be the governess and the baby is brought home to Menjou's wife as their new adopted kid!
But then, it's Frank Capra.
We know she's going on a vacation with her life savings, but why set her up as a small town librarian and then never make reference to that part of her life again in the movie?
Even the best directors turn out a clinker now and then and Capra was learning both his craft and his message at this time.
He then continues his secret and illicit affair with her where at the same time puts on a false face, to the public, that he's a happily married man.
And if you're black and rich, then you're white and need to be knocked back down into being black.
Are we watching an examination of race relations, or are we watching a poor little rich boy deal with his unresolved racial/class issues by endorsing the same idea of Crab Theory--see "The Corner" for more on this in a much more mature way then Lee could ever imagine or wants to--that tortured him as he was growing up?
If the characters were important enough to recap at the end, then they were important enough to explain in the first place.
I can't tell, but I ask because a friend of mine told me she had watched a little bit of this film and then stopped because it was bad; and I found it truly entertaining, funny and charming.
The director of the film, Marco Brambilla, showed Stallone the way in "Demolition Man", was in charge of this and then of the marvelous miniseries "Dinotopia".
From then on Bruford gets flashbacks on all the times he sold out and recalls a crucial moment when he screwed over his own brother Flip(Afemo Omilami)by refusing to come help him out when he tried to get a job at his workplace.
If the Drop Squad really did exist then I'm glad they did but if they didn't I couldn't be more disappointed especially since we need them now more than ever!
If we Whites really want to be Equal (and not just announce it all the time) then we will encourage more Blacks to become one with their distant past.
And if it puts some of Europeans most powerful parts in history to the background then so what?
I loved her then as I still do.
The town's generations, all taught by this remarkable woman, react; some come from far away or start stopping by the hospital for news; and this leads to a flashback of how her life's course was changed by her father's money problems and the desertion of her by her erstwhile suitor; how she then vowed to pay back every cent of her father's debt, though she was not personally responsible; and how she began teaching school and has gone on doing so.
To sum up; more then one hour of stupidity, bad acting and soft gay porn cinematography.
And then move on.
He is then placed in a cell and begins his two-year prison term.
It isn't long before hubby gets a phone call from Audrey's TWIN SISTER, and then a visit from her, and then a roll in the hay too.
", all sweetness and pecan pies, and then suddenly a bear claw, "Are you telling me I can't take my own daughter home?"
To see her speak her lines, to hear the delicate phrasing of not only her Polish, but her German with a Polish accent, then later, her English with a Polish accent, an altogether brutally difficult accomplishment, leaves me breathless.
It opens with an incredibly gruesome murder scene, then goes on to imply that it's really not so bad to kill someone, as long as you "have a reason".
Sophie survived Ausschwitz, drinks to much and is completely dedicated to Nathan, who now and then gets terrible moods.
This was a very engaging film about a guy who murders his cheating wife and then is released from prison 8 years later.
If you are coming to this review BEFORE having seen "Leon" ("The Professional") then my best advice is just to disregard the rest of what follows and take "Nikita" on its own terms.
If the movie was not as successful as it is (in terms of stirring up deep-seated emotions), then there wouldn't be so many poor ratings on this BBS.
Then if we come to the second conclusion that he never repented, we are then facing a more intimidating mentality.
The undertone of the film will then be entirely altered.
If the binding up of the cut finger can be looked upon as a sort of set up for this plot development, then it comes as abrupt and trite as all other plot developments in this film.
This film will challenge and disturb some and totally put off others, but if films that dont just whip out tired old cliches are your style then don't look past this little gem.
Much like others, In the Company of Men initially enraged me due to the harsh treatment and depiction of women in the workplace, but then it occurred to me, that isn't what LaBute wants to show.
Chad suggests that they date the same woman for the duration of the six week stay then dump her.
They will both date her, and then after a six-week period, they will dump her, a plan they've devised after years of being tormented and unlucky with women.
The first climax makes the movie a success, the second makes the film great--only then do we see Labute's true intent.
Whitesnake singer David Coverdale has received more than his share of criticism over the years for letting his band be a revolving door platform for talented musicians who come in for an album/tour, then ride off into the sunset only to be replaced on the next tour.
If you like terror, blood and sex, then here's a shocker to sink your teeth into.
A jilted loser, Philip Markham (Edward Furlong) of a bachelorette-style reality show seeks revenge on the woman who turned him down (Jaime Pressley), by killing her and her hot husband (who doesn't appear to be credited unfortunately), then starts his own reality show, where one by one the contestants are killed off - usually by Markham's dimwitted brother, Claude, leaving only the "final girl" (Laura Ramsey).
Also they talk about what it was like in lesbian bars back then.
It was insightful to here about life back then, dispelling others into thinking that it's some sort of trend (tsk, tsk!)
It's so cruel; to torture the audience so long, give them the hope of being entertained, and then snatch it viciously from them!
the doomsday machine is a hunk of space junk,i believe it was filmed in 1968 and shelved till 1972.the cast is noteworthy but wasted,grant Williams(incredible shrinking man)Casey kasum(American top ten DJ) Mala powers,bobby van(navy vs the night monsters)James Craig(the cyclops)and mike Farrell(m*a*s*h*)as a reporter.the Chinese invent a doomsday device and well you know the rest.its a really bad premise and the special fx look hokey.its bottom of the barrel science fiction thats not even so bad its good.if you need a cure for insomnia then by all means watch the doomed doomsday machine.Elvira hosted this film on VHS/DVD too bad mst3k isn't still on they would have a field day with this.1 out of 10.
Keep your eye on the clock that records the elapsed time following blast off, you'll note that it goes, 2:58, 2:59, and then 2:60 instead of 3:00, which makes perfect sense considering all the other goofy stuff that was going on.
I feel especially bad for Grant Williams, a fine actor, who was likely blacklisted because of his sexual preferences, not to mention a well publicized feud with Jack Webb, then director of production for Universal.
And then it all ends in a whimpering blaze (yes I know this is oxymoronic, but it is how I felt).
But then, it's as though the makers of the movie just totally ran out of script, money, and inspiration, and the flick completely dies; just marking time with inane dialog and absolutely no developments for what seems like an eternity.
), then becomes a battle-of-the-sexes-in-outer-space flick, finally ending with a bizarre philosophical encounter with a superior alien intelligence.
Its starts off in one direction and then heads off into another.
Grabbing a butcher knife, he brutally stabs both of them to death then calmly rides his bicycle to the local police station and turns himself in.
The UFO sequence is very lame and the comic behavior of a man just out of prison seems inappropriate as he marches like a soldier then runs after a jogging team that is passing by.
I tried to watch this disastrous movie and then just decided to skip to "Send in the Clowns" which about an hour and 45 minutes into the picture.
If you want to see an example of why Sondheim's musicals have mostly not made it to the screen or you want to see Ms. Taylor in one of her less-than- stellar moments, then by all means, watch this film.
Incredulous, Takuro returns early form his nocturnal fishing to find his wife engaged in passionate sex and Takuro stabs her to death, then bicycles to the police station and turns himself in for the murder of Emiko.
They sing a few songs together and then he drops him off in Vegas.
Watching Mary Steenburgen's character leave her husband "Melvin" to move into some horrible motel room where she's slapped around in front of her young daughter, and then become a stripper in an equally horrible burlesque establishment, isn't something I want to spend the time or mental energy watching.
She's working in a nude go-go bar then quits.
I saw this film back in 1980/81 when it was first released and liked it a lot then.
******** SPOILER ******** The movie starts out teasing the audience by showing us a small glimpse of the sad condition of this once great man had ascended to, but then it's over, poof.
Nothing profound, or earth shaking takes place in the small time Melvin spends with Howard and then the rest of the movie was all about Melvin.
But if the chance comes up to watch it then grab it.
Trust me, it did then too, but in a different vein.
We feel her pain as she suspects, then has her suspicions gradually confirmed, that her son is a Communist spy.
At one point there is a minor traffic accident and one perks up, thinking maybe something is about to happen - then everybody shrugs it off and the gloomy talking resumes.
I made it through an hour and then dozed off.
But on the surface, Walker's derelictions are not any liaisons he may pursue in Rock Creek Park after midnight but his abandonment first of his faith then of patriotism.
But I remember when I first viewed this really peculiar glop, at the tender age of about 10, only a year or two after it had premiered, I was unimpressed even then.
Al Capp's characters translate to Broadway and then to Hollywood.
As I said in my review of the earlier and lesser straight 1940 version, the plot is much more elaborate this time around â not only do we get an attempt to evacuate the community to make way for A-Bomb tests (a nice touch of topicality) but Abner, Marryinâ Sam (Stubby Kaye) and later many of the people of Dogpatch go to Washington to present the Government with an essential homegrown product (the town had been deemed âthe most useless in the U.S.A.â) and then to save the naÃ¯ve Abner from the clutches of megalomaniac General Bullmoose (Howard St. John).
If you are a fan of Al Capp, then this movie is a must to see!
So if you want to enjoy an almost perfect musical with a few genuine belly laughs along the way, then this is the musical for you!
And he has a girl name Cindy who loves him but Yogi doesn't love her back, thats so funny.I wished they never stopped making "The Yogi Bear Show", the people back then and right now will miss the show.
Yogi Bear was first a segment on The Huckleberry Hound Show and then Yogi got promoted to his own show and Hokey Wolf took Yogi's place on The Huckleberry Hound Show.
He guest starred he was orange and then when he got his own cartoon he was pink with cuffs and collar tie which made him look like a brother to the Pink Panther almost.
I almost turned it off after only 15min and then I forced myself to watch until the point that Bette walked off.
If someone wants to see a Bette Davis film then I recommend they watch All About Eve or Now Voyager or The Letter... or if you want to see a "farewell" performance then watch The Whales of August which co stars Lillian Gish, Vincent Price, Ann Southern and Harry Carey Jr.
One thing that needed explanation was Vanessa Redgrave's British accent, at times, slipping through clear as day... maybe her character was born in England then moved to America at an early age and the two accents merged?
From then on, though, it does seem like the cast is just reciting lines.
Lesser-known (and under-appreciated) Flynn shines as her character offers first romance, then rock-solid strength to Jody as well as light touches of humor throughout the film.
Throughout the movie, and then reading about the woman afterwards, I felt complete and utter anger at the legal system for allowing something like this to happen.
But then I decided i was going to watch it and i was glad that I did.
Until then, we've had small humorous asides from a few characters, but outside of that, we're not sure where the movie is going.
By then, it's too late, even if the movie had begun behaving the way it's supposed to.
Even his best friend and comrade eventually jettisons him, literally turning his back and then walking away.
If you like techno punk futuristic waste land sci-fi movies then you will like this.
If you like CP movies, then why not.
This film was such a success that it went on to fare well in the U.K. and the States, which is always an achievement for a subtitled film, was later remade in Hollywood as Point of No Return and then finally as a TV series.
The tears, the laughs... my kids actually were far more into this movie then they were the original.
Till then I'll recommend this version of The Last of Mrs. Cheyney without hesitation.
But it always bugged me in Bambi, that in one scene his mother dies and his father takes him away, and then, in next scene Bambi is big and everybody is happy.
If you don't believe me, then read on to find out about the terrible plot.
This film is ONLY for devoted fans of the actors--and even then you might want to think twice about seeing this one.
That was one of the most wonderful things about the first movie ...even more than sixty years after it's release, the songs were so well written that they sound just as good now as they did then.
Imagine my surprise, then, at the quality of Bambi 2.
The better ending would have had the plumber getting out of jail and then showing up out of the blue in Switzerland.
I say that he was "set off," because if he did in every apartment what he does in Jill's then he would have been locked up a long time ago.
Overall, you don't have to be a plumber to enjoy this movie, but if you are, or even involved in a trade that brings you into people's homes, then the absurdity of the situations in this film will probably hit home a bit harder.
Final View On The Film:  If you want to see a very enjoyably gripping film,then see this..
In the 70,s we were gathering a following in Adelaide playing pubs ,clubs and large venue,s and were approached to write a few songs for the film.After putting the songs together in a short time,we went into a recording studio and laid down 3 tracks Unfortunately the songs can only be heard on the plumbers radio while he,s working, and even then it,s you can barely hear it.
The bleeding-heart liberal apologists hadn't taken over the media by then.
The picture is a splendid British film concerning about historic deeds in WWII,the naval battle in the South Atlantic between British cruiser squadron of three ships and the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee, Dic 1939 ;the protagonists and secondaries are incarnated by a magnificent plethora English actors.The film is based on true events ,these are the following: Though the British cruisers were no match for the battleship,Admiral Sir Henry Harwood(Anthony Quayle) launched an attack to Graf Spee(with 6 cannons,280 mm).German fire seriously damaged HMS Exeter(John Cregson,captain Bell)with cannons 203mm,put half of HMS Ajax(captain Woodhouse, Ian Hunter)'s guns out of action,and then damaged Achilles(cannons 152 mm),but the cruisers did sufficient damage to the German ship to make its captain break off and run for shelter in Montevideo,Uruguay.The British followed,and waited in international waters outside the neutral port.The Uruguay government ordered the Germans to leave after 72 hours.The British cruisers named Royal and Renown were near from Montevideo and Langsdorff(Peter Finch) didn't wait possibilities to vanquish.Hitler,reluctant to risk the Graf Spee being sunk by heavier British warship which were sailing for the River Plate ,ordered the captain to scuttle the vessel.He did so 17 Dec 1939 and three days later shot himself.The film contains a colorful and glimmer cinematography by Christopher Challis.The movie is well produced(with the Archers production)and directed by Emeric Pressburger and Michael Powell.The motion picture will like to warlike genre fans and classic British cinema.
They would make one more movie the next year, a film Powell called nothing more than a programmer, and they would then go, still friends, their separate ways.
We've got the ugly American and her driver, a despicable b---h she is, an idiot he; the pretty American and her pal, nothing more than kill fodder; the egghead archaeologist and college student, first she hates, him then she loves him, then she accidentally stabs him with a sharp stick; last we have the hunter, a character who's motives are pretty much a mystery, a one-dimensional cardboard cutout played by Vinnie Jones.
How should i say it ?......if u survive the first minutes of the film ,which for a movie start are horrible, then u would waste 90 minutes of your life.
And then there's the cockney "hunter", Vinnie Jones - along along with three Americans for good measure.
And then there's Birdwell Hawkins (or Birdie as he was best known).
Lobo replies " let him get just outside of town, then give him a ticket for speeding" LOL
i knew even back then that it was a spin off of bj and the bear.
And since then, the word "Lobo" itself has become synonymous with bad TV.
I think not for two reasons: 1) From time to time we just NEED a vague movie, and 2) If they wanted it to become better, then try to find alternatives.
Frankly the words "Lisa Kudrow" and movie just make shudder, but a friend who's taste in movies is just a bit different then my own suggested it so when I saw it playing on TMN I thought I'd watch it.
The movie Office Space came to mind on more then on occasion while watching this.
From then on it all gets a bit silly.
A good cast and they do their best with what they're given, but the story makes no sense, the characters' actions are inexplicable, and there are too many moments of unintentional humor, as when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces of a phonograph record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts off.
So what's the point then?
Because then the suspense would be over.
Oh and lets mix in a satanic cult - and then forget about them completely.
The presents of old enemies faces each other, and then sharing a drink is the best ever.
Howard Stern back then unleashed his adult brand of radio and TV humor that would be recognized later from E and Howard TV OnDemand.
Indeed the stories don't go to deep most of the time and that is the appealing part of it, but now and then people have a need for extra emotions besides humor.
The whole episode I was so happy that Frye was going to get his friend back, and then he misinterprets everything.
THe kid was kidnapped and then assumed murdered when he was quite young.
Wellman employs a prowling camera and keeps his performers in constant motion which was a bit different then most of the static direction of the era.
Cagney then emerges, wounded and staggering through the rain.
Powers then ends up in hospital but is kidnapped.
There is then a knock at the door of the family home...
After the local "Fagin", known as "Putty Nose" double crosses them, leaving them out in the street following a burglary gone bad (Putty had set them up with the burglary job, and then when a Beat Cop got killed in the process by the young hoods, old Putty locked his door on them).
This led to the famous scene in which Tom Powers first purchased, and then shot the horse that had fatally thrown Nathan while riding the Bridle Path in Lincoln Park.
The making of the small-time hustler into sweeping gangster is not fully-explored, but merely assumed, and then there is an alternating mega- and micro-look into that crooked world.
Tom then meets Jean Harlow and she seems to fall for him, although his interest in her is rather more glandular than anything else.
The narrative proceeds to give a standard history of this type is formed, beginning with him getting into petty crime as a kid, and then following him as he proceeds up the ranks of the underworld.
The final shootout occurs completely off-screen, with the audience seeing only the build-up and then the aftermath, and looks ahead to Takeshi Kitano's minimalist mob flick "Sonatine."
The famous "grapefruit scene" with Cagney shoving the fruit in Mae Clark's face wasn't that big a deal back then and the scene happens so fast you almost miss it.
"Public Enemy," however, was a bigger-budget production, directed by William Wellman, and it contained all the elements of successÂ It is the story of two brothers who become Chicago booze barons in the Twenties... One was Cagney, the other Edward WoodsÂ   It is sometimes claimed that the story of "Public Enemy" is based on that of "Little Hymie" Weiss, leader of the North Side Chicago gang after the murder of Dion O'Banion by the Capones in 1924Â What is more likely is that the Cagney characterization is based on "Little Hymie"; the plot itself is pure fictionÂ   When Cagney, in his striped pajama, sat opposite Mae Clarke at breakfast and decided he had had enough of this boring broad, he wasted no timeÂ He picked up half a grapefruit and planted it full into Clarke's faceÂ It was a piece of screen action which has lasted down the years as the ultimate in violence from the gangster to his mollÂ   Of course, it isn't Â it just seems that wayÂ Since then gir1s have been slapped, kicked, beaten up, run over, shot, stabbed and raped, all in the tradition of mobster violenceÂ   But at the time this scene was daring, and the more daring because it was totally unexpectedÂ We remember Mae Clarke in "Public Enemy," yet forget that Jean Harlow was in it, tooÂ There may have been good reasonÂ The New York Times, reviewing the film in 1934, commented: "The acting throughout is interesting, with the exception of Jean Harlow, who essays the role of a gangster's mistress."
It rushed to the climax and then dragged out the gore for what I can only assume was shock value and media provocation.
The story is written as a drama, which then, of course, turns into horror.
But there isn't all bad news, the creature design and the CGI effects are very well done for a low budget movie, if you ask me RICHARD HATCH is a major sell out, first this then the remake of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA which true fans will say is Galactica in name alone.
But if that's your thing, then sure, go ahead and watch it.
By the way, if you happen to love UNSEEN EVIL, then go watch DEMONICUS (2001).
It starts with the false suicide of a very young girl, hanged nude under a roof and then proceeds with a lot of cars and bikes chases (the killer is always covered by a motorcycle helmet until the very end - it is possible that the director of Night School took from here the idea of the killer masked with an helmet), almost always running without pauses.
Nikita does as told, shoots, runs, searches, opens the window - but then the windows is walled.
However, no question, back then, this movie was the starter for a whole series of story lines and Luc Besson merits credit for his originality.
So basically Gig Young is there, and then he isn't.
Mr. Wilding (then Mr. Elizabeth Taylor) and Gig Young do their best, as Crawford co-stars.
Naturally she hates him then falls in love with him.
Joan is herself and then some, and eventually discovers the reason she cannot make an impression on the pianist.
And to add an extra cherry on top of the sundae, we're asked to believe that even though he was a journalist, went to war, then came back blind, now he is suddenly a brilliant pianist who knows every note of every song Jenny is going to (lip-synch) sing, even though it's a new show with new songs that the public hasn't heard yet -- songs that he already has memorized (because Jenny's former MD, who could not STAND her, "teaches" Mike the songs).
Then Mike and Joan have their absolutely unbelievable moment of "human warmth," make asinine jokes about his seeing-eye dog, and then kiss each other with all the excitement of two mannequins on Prozac.
Shooting took place in 1967 while cruising between Los Angeles and Acapulco(Mexico)I earned US$ 80,- for my (very small)part.I since then followed the career of James Garner, especially the TV-series like the mini-series "Space"(Michener) and Space Cowboys (2000) and the series of Jim Rockford, the P.I.starting in the seventies.
If you like movies from the late '60s like "Yours, Mine & Ours" & "The Impossible Years", then you will really appreciate the humour and storyline of this classic '60s romance/comedy.
The sets may seem a little dated, but the story is every bit as exciting as it was then, and given the developments in computer technology and artificial intelligence, even more relevant.
This movie reflects a major fear in the era before PCs (or microcomputers as they then were called).
The lights then dim again, as they should.
So why is this movie good then to myself and the other reviewers?
Be warned however this film will scare you; there is no blood or gore and the special effects are primitive by modern standards, but if The Forbin Project does not scare your brain then you have not understood it.
If you want to see this film online, go to Google and type in "MÃ©liÃ¨s" and then click the video button for a long list of his films that are viewable without special software.
It starts with two green, pitchfork-holding demons in horned headdresses luring a woman into their castle, wrapping her in a sheet and then throwing her into a cauldron, which then erupts in flames.
They then throw two others in.
The second demon stirs the pot and then the lead demon (played by the director himself) summons each of the three individual spirits.
Smoke and fire erupt from the cauldron as each spirit emerges and then floats around overhead.
Excellent remake that is actually better then the original.
If you like edge of your seat action and non stop fright, then you have to see the 1990 remake of "Night of The Living Dead" a horror fan's dream come true.
And then there is still Ben played by Tony Todd, this has got to be a cool role he plays and very good acting too, as he plays the loner from the city who seems to know how to fight these beings.
But then after spending time with people that annoyed her to no end she suddenly gets survival skills OUT OF NOWHERE.
But then it gets very stupid.
Barbara then finds Harry that made everything fall apart.
That if you're selfish and you can't work with the others, then you'll survive, but then the other survivor will come back and shoot you?
That was far worse to him then facing a rampaging armored division of the Red Army!
This parallels the then current political idea of a society that would be best ruled by scientists, engineers and the like.
When you think the film  is wrapped, the murders solved, and major character killed, the  plot moves to present day (then 1966-67) as the murderer strikes  again.
And then there is the identity of the murder victims, who are prostitutes.
Major Grau, played by Omar Sharif, is brilliant as the tracker of the 3 Generals who are suspects in the murder of a Warsaw prostitute and then, years later, of a Parisian prostitute, who is brutally mutilated in the same manner.
She thinks it is just for a meal but ends up having to kill somebody and then fight her way out of the restaurant.
(In the book, Grau WAS more concerned with things like the plot against Hitler, but I think the movie handled things in a more original way, as in the scene where he and Morand discuss the subject for a few moments, then Grau movies on to something else!)
I don't understand, though, why Tanz wears the uniform of a Wermacht general through most of the film, then shows up at his last confrontation with Grau dressed as an SS officer.
If Grau were so high-minded, then how could he serve such a master?
Don't expect a movie with ghouls and monsters, it rather is more fun to watch then it is scary and the Lugosi/Karloff combination is what makes this movie a real classic.
Those parts in the movie, where they show the dark abyss all the time and then this LOTR style map pops up with a wheel falling down - it just doesn't look good, it looks totally tasteless.
In reality Russian Forces were far more intelligent and imaginative during the Russo-Turkish War then the movie suggests.
If not, then why do the Turks seem like Military geniuses while the Russians look like morons?
Rishi, then takes the blame for not marrying her, by saying he was in love with her younger sister, Roja.
But honestly, this movie was much much better then just DECENT!!!
If they don't then they are liars and they don't love cinema and movies!!!!!
The only problem that I have with this movie are a small handful of scenes in which Indian patriotism is showcased in what I felt was a rather blunt manner (but then, coming from a different country, I may lack some essential cultural background to understand it).
The girl worships her savior, who marries her for the swindle and then ... but I won't spoil the ending.
It was only during the Nineties that Price's character marries the Drew character and goes to prison and then only for a few years.
As gringo Reavis was unable to pass for a descendant of Peralta, he then found a Mestiza girl in a Mexican orphanage, whom he supplied with (forged) documents allegedly proving her pedigree as the descendant of Miguel de Peralta.
Reavis then married this 'heiress' to solidify his claim to the land.
Armed with his authentic-looking deeds, Reavis then solicited backers (including William Randolph Hearst's father) to press his claims against the U.S. government.
But then a federal investigator noticed a discrepancy in one of the documents...  Vincent Price, not yet the ham actor he would be later, gives a riveting performance as Reavis.
James Reavis spent a year in prison awaiting trial, then served two years: a surprisingly merciful sentence.
Special mention for Rajpal Yadav who gets credit for being as if not more annoying then Johny Lever in less that 10 films hot on his trail is Boman Irani who of he continues these roles will no doubt catch up with him.Anupam Kher must have been really broke to have accepted the role in this film.
this leaves little room for anything more (cgi wasn't invented then) and so healthy toothed mrs tierney mainly looks plainly distressed.
not all is wasted though because if nothing more we learn from mr preminger that women wore hats back then to disguise the fact that they were beaten up pretty often.
But I didn't buy it for a minute when Korvo orders Ann around in a trance and then hypnotizes himself hours after major surgery.
And then Korvo does it againÂhe hypnotizes himself once more so he can leave the hospital and try and get his hands on the recordings.
He believes her, then he doesn't, she's nuts, she's not, oh dear, what to do, what to do.
If you have a 100min or so to kill, and want to watch a low budget Italian/Spanish anti-war(Vietnam)movie that is poorly written not very well acted, somewhat funny(although it was not filmed for any laughs), and has a better version of Tara Reid then Tara Reid herself in it...then this movie is for you...Andrew Wolf(II)
Ferrer plays this role with style, he's a big scumbag (a murderer, blackmailer, and there are remote possibilities that he made Tierney do more then clean up his dirty work), but he does this with class, I could still buy why Tierney (and others, such as his society friends) decided to trust a man who had given her plenty of warning signs.
It would be almost 10 years before this was a much more common thread, in such movies as the Kim Novak/Kirk Douglas "STRANGERS WHEN WE MEET," and then films with James Dean, who became the poster boy of idyllic family life with a dysfunctional core.
Chris Morris plays the presenter who tells the audience that an infamous paedophile has been launched into space then confesses that an eight year old child has accidentally been placed into the capsule along with the paedophile .
if you think that it is 'awful', 'distasteful' or 'sick' then i can only think of one thing to say to you: "go to hell."
Nikita squares this problem away just with the protagonist: a young punk (Anne Parillaud, in her most recognizable, near star-making performance) who kills a cop in the midst of a shoot-out is sentenced to life, but then sort of resurrected following the lead of a member of a covert spy organization, and given an ultimatum: become a spy/assassin, or die.
In some ways it is recycled material, but then again many Disney movies have similar plots.
Some parts seem so, but then the Land Before Time followed little child dinos and Dinosaur followed a herd of Dinosaurs.Their destination was basically the same place, but in many ways their journeys are so different.
So go see the first 20 min, then leave and catch another movie that will challenge your brain a little (like Road Trip!)
I mean, if this is your gripe, then you just don't get Disney movies.
Some of the characters vocals will make you sick and seem very inappropriate for this kind of movie but if the graphics were not so amazing then I would tell you to forget this movie.
I think this film is underrated and if people do not like this first time, or rate my comment not useful, then I think that they're DEFINITELY missing an important detail of this lovely film!
If you really want to see a very enjoyable animated movie, then this is one that you really must see, it will get your desire for computer animation really going, this movie has got some of the best computer animation that I have ever seen!
But this movie, in my opinion, has more points because of the animation then the story itself.
This doesn't stop the drama from unfolding, however, nor the talk about wealth and power, first with old man at the bar and then when an upper-class couple who got stranded in a sandstorm come in and also get in on the conversation.
A group of three then come in and they take the tourist with them to their destination, which they never reach.
The tourist makes his own way back to the cafÃ© and the crooks are not far behind and then they go into the cafÃ© and hold everyone hostage in there to be joined by the group of three later on.
The truth is he didn't enter the film until over halfway through and even then didn't have many lines.
He hadn't made much of an impression then, but he was in Tinseltown to stay after The Petrified Forest and his frightening characterization of criminal on the run, Duke Mantee.
The best context to look at "The Petrified Forest" is through the context of the first great disaster of the 20th Century: World War I (or, as it was known then, "The Great War").
It then gave reason for Maria's character to choose to do what she did at the end.
And then there's this counterpart couple, very well to do yuppies that are desperately in need of a baby and are ready to do anything to get it.
He made his debut as the Time Lord in the closing moments of 'The Parting Of The Ways', then appeared in a short sketch for 'Children In Need' in November, but his first full episode was this special, the first Christmas 'Who' since 1965's 'The Feast Of Steven' with William Hartnell.
If you find all this bizarre and far fetched then I'm afraid you just don't understand the spell DOCTOR WHO has cast over generations of audiences for decades and I pity you   There are problems and like the successes they're down to RTD .
It would be impossible to make a biographical film of Ms. Earhart then or now without some included elements of myth.
It is beautifully shot with some of the finest acting i have seen in a long while, but then what else would you expect from a this cast list?
It could be said to be intelligent viewing - we're not just sponge fed everything there and then - and thats a welcome change too!
What I see then is a story about youth.
), but I think it shouldn't have been part of this movie, because the situation of the woman, her husband (if he lives), her child and her lover is far too serious to just pop up for a moment now and then as a side story.
It is a rather slow movie compared to your typical Hollywood movie, but then again the story and characters are also stronger.
It supports the story, but may seem a little late 80's every now and then, but never the less it sounds good.
"Once upon a time," Daffy starts...and then stops to say, "Great opening, huh?"
Ben Gazzara is superb as the club owner who gets into trouble, out of trouble and then right back in again.
He murders the target half way through the film, who turns out to be a bigger fry than just a bookie, and then realises he's been set up by the hoodlums.
It's a set-up from the get go because the mob never believed he could pull it off, and was hoping that he would be killed, and then they would inherit his club.
My ultimate question is, lack of resolve, and far fetched plot aside, if the director was simply going to have his main character go throughout the 2nd half of the entire film with a severe gun shot wound, as if there was no gunshot wound at all, then what was he trying to prove by it?
His escape involves a light jog and a bus ride (you heard me) and then he's back at his club to watch the girls do their show, blissfully unaware that the mob now intends to kill him to cover up their tracks.
Without knowing all the facts Cosmo even if he succeeds in knocking off the Chinaman and living to tell about will then be targeted by the man, John, who contracted him to do it!
A live Cosmo Vitelli is far more dangerous to John & Co. then a dead one!
One of the signatures of Cassavetes' films is that they reach the climax, and then go on about another hour before ending.
Each scene devises a way to create a new pathway into your brain and then connects them all by a provoking plot and visually graphic and cursingly dramatic storytelling.
The movie starts out like any typical hack'em up suspense flick with moody music, quick edits, and lots of in-your-face gore, some plot, and then some odd characters -- the cast of suspects.
In another scene, Cho is in an elevator and looks up to see bright blood dripping from the hatchway, and then also dripping down the wall; suddenly, the hatch breaks and buckets of blood cascade onto him.
And then there's a further nod to another thriller, Kiss the girls (1997), where the idea of a deadly duo is raised and then quashed when a prime suspect is himself reduced to a jumble of parts in a bag.
Exhibit A: cop finds out his pretty but sulky witness has attempted suicide several times, turns around and leaves her alone in his flat with his one and only gun, then goes after a serial killer without any weapon, gets mauled in the process, survives the ordeal, chases the killer a second time, this time still without any weapon... And just when you think it can't get any dumber than this, well, that's exhibit A, and as Picard puts it, "Plenty of letters left in in the alphabet"  A thinking person's movie?
It will probably please most "slasher and horror fans" that like their films bloody and mysterious, but if you're looking for a more intelligent and effective (both mentally and physically) piece, then it will probably come as a more or less slight disappointment as it came to me.
Her pushy agent, Sidney Stone (JoBeth Williams) is upset, then, to learn that Amanda is not happy with the script of her latest project.
This is one of the best pieces of TV drama i've seen, this I'm sorry to say is better then any previous Marple or recent Agatha Christie dramatisation I've seen.
All but cynical Chrsitie purists couldn't help but enjoy this whodunit meant as Christie's characters should have been bold and larger then life.
When a movie has the power to make a person feel something strong or inspire them to the point that they will do something about their inspiration, then it must be a great film, and "Just Write," is!
This film touches the soul, if not then no film can.
There are movies and then there are brilliant movies and to me in my opinion, this is a brilliant movie.
Since then she has been raised by her Grandfather and step-Grandmother.
So, if you're at Hollywood Video and see this one in front of you in the horror section, just repeat this to yourself "Put it down, take a step back, turn to the left and then calmly but promptly walk away."
but he sure has a bad taste of humor, then.
I know that if you went through every show ever made in the world you would probably find some old shows from the 1970s or something made in Croatia with a budget of about five dollars that are maybe even worse but considering the quality of shows we have in North America and the fact there is a real budget, etc, with this show being available in like thirty million homes, then the amount that this show was a total fail really becomes apparent.
I would say Girls Will Be Girls is the worst of all time, I can't even talk about that show without wanting to destroy something, Pop Cultured is second worst and then who knows, Punched Up, Keys to the VIP, Shakespeare Comedy, there are a lot of bad ones to choose from.
If you are a fan of film noir, action/espionage, character drama, or romance, you should see this film; then you should own this film.
They just spew out information, then add something like "Then I went home and drank soda while watching Survivor."
I saw this movie in 1978, bought the soundtrack on LP and then all of Rex Smith's albums!
I don't know what it was, maybe cause I was 18 when I saw the film and a Letta us guys had girlfriends (or were in love with girls) that were a fies years younger and it just didn't fit in back then (mostly with the fathers) and the movie kinda made it feel better for us, made us all feel like we were OK and that the feelings were real and OK, I was overwhelmed at the time, being in a relationship with a girl that was 16, it helped me sort it all out.
I bought it and watch it every now and then when I want to escape to a simpler, less complicated time, with slumber parties, "Teen Beat" posters on the walls, vinyl records scattered about, slurping on NON-diet sodas and talking with my friends about boys and music and boys!
Thirteen back then was in many ways a lot more grown up.
One thing that made me love the film then as much as now is not taking the clichÃ©, easy, tied-with-a-bow but sort of let-down ending.
I laugh at all of the funny scenes like the re-occurring "No Dogs allowed" signs that appear every now and then.
Snoopy makes a cross-country journey, and is then torn between staying with his former owner, who needs him, and returning to the place he considers home.
I watched this movie with my niece and nephew who enjoyed it much as I did back then.
I wish things were a lot simpler now as it was then.
Snoopy then has a bit of fun with Linus' elder sister Lucy, who is using boxing gloves, and they have a bit of a light-hearted spar, but again Snoopy pushes things that little bit too far and ends up upsetting Lucy and she spits the dummy at him.
This seemed like such a nice and enjoyable gem back then, with some scenes as breezy as a summer's day and others with a somewhat darker but thoughtful tone (themes of rejection and the sadness of separation).
Irfan's character then secretly strikes up a deal to have the family's lives taped without their knowledge and in the process and bunch of ugly misdeeds surface and resurface.
She then visits the Joshi family, requesting that she use their upcoming family wedding as a part of her TV serial.
She then comes to realize that Manoj Joshi (Irrfan Khan), the bride's youngest uncle has fallen in love with her.
But then, it's somehow so much more.
Nice simple effects at times, like mixing the images of "back then" with the soundtrack of "now".
We meet the same group of people then and now, with grand passion, bullfighting and Gipsy Kings thrown into the mix.
The first of the game has you be a small Dinosaur and you take on Dinosaurs bigger then you.
If you want a Video Game based on the Jurassic Park Films then I would suggest Warpath Juassic Park.
You start off playing as a small dinosaur then you play as a raptor then a human then a T-rex and finally a human again.
Generally, I thought that Peter Redgrave as Fowler (a middle aged, jaded British journalist) and Audie Murphy as "The American" put on pretty decent performances, I appreciated the look (somewhat limited but still present) at Vietnamese culture, and I also appreciated the portrayal of the very early years of the Vietnam War, when it was still the French dealing with a Communist insurgency in what was then an integral part of their Empire.
As Fowler remarks, it would be better for the American if he had a few faults of his own, then he might understand others better.
In Greene's novel, the seemingly naive, idealistic American who is in (then) French Indochina for vaguely idealistic operative is in fact a sinister undercover CIA operative in cahoots with an unscrupulous general.
Together with the general, he plans and executes bombings in public places that result in the deaths of dozens of innocent people, then leaves evidence making it appear that the Communists carried out the bombing.
The way in which she is 'colonised' by first Fowler and then the American (Pyle in the novel, but not named in this film) is a comment on the way in which the foreign landscape is depicted and also on how the country has been colonised.
Kathleen cuffs him to the car door, and then Dean picks the lock of the cuff around his wrist.
But if you like to watch the world's worst horror movie then this is for you.
It seems many more murders have occurred since then but all of this remains unknown to these three young upstart employees hoping to finally make it big on their own.
Neil Flanagan (aka "Lynn" Flanagan) brings a lot of depth to the role of queen Cherry Lane--sweet one moment, bitchy another moment; kind and considerate, but then thoughtless.
H2O portrays Canadians as a bunch of supine, weak-willed, uncaring fools ruled by a secret clique manipulating a naive political class, but then again, lefties portray all nationalities that way.
The assassin traps her, spills clues about the conspiracy, and then lets her go.
If you don't know much about the Canadian (or British) Parliamentary democracy then you might be a little lost.
This 1989 French film was justifiably so popular that an American re-make followed later and then a cable television series followed after that.
All the men she meets just seem to be interested in sex then in love.
and then writes the name of the date-gone-wrong beneath the image before adding them to her wall of shame.
We got to see Ava and Andy again, but then had to say goodbye to them *sniff* I totally didn't see the whole evil Ava coming....and neither did Andy it would seem.
Excellent use of him brining in a big secret though, and then dying before revealing it.
It is a love story with a twist finally depicting that the love for the truth and for the country is far greater then one's personal feeling.
I am really feeling bad about fanaa movie, in this movie they are showing a terrorist has a hero, if this is the case then all terrorists will think them self has heroes, what about he killed more than 100 Indians and their wife and their sons/daughters?
We should not support these types of movies, if we are really Indians and we supports our nation then we need to burn the movie and also the actors they played in this movie.
I know only this types of movies can run in India, if it is in any other country if movie like this came in their country against their own country, then they may banned and burned it at that movement it self.
If these types of movies will run in India then only GOD has to save India.
I couldn't stay up watching this, but I mean I think Veer Zaara is much better then this story.So If id give this a movie out of 5 id give this a 1 or a 0.5
If you're into creepy horror flicks, then this film is certainly for you.
This was 40 minutes I will never get back, so take it from me, when facing the chance to watch something else vs. this movie, then take something else.
for me i guess it would have been better if ADITYA CHOPRA would have directed this movie(and then maybe it would have that "dilwale dulhaniya.." GRACE) the story has many LOOP HOLES.
and then i would have been much happier.
This is hands down the best romantic film since .....well in a long time , all the people i know who haven't liked this film is because its got impossible situations in it and its slow in the 2nd half all i have to say : stop watching Hindi films then and continue watching 25 sec ads which have diminished your attention span .
She loses it and then sits in the back of her car as it drives itself?
She awkwardly befriends a hip and attractive neighbor and then, with her pathetic neediness and constant visits (not to mention her failure to understand subtle interpersonal cues) drives the neighbor to hate her.
Also if your a B grade film lover then raging sharks is right up your ally.
But then again, Ed Wood movies are so bad they're watchable over and over again.
While diving outside two of the crew are attacked & killed by the Sharks which then bite through the power cables & oxygen supply rendering the laboratory crippled & those left inside trapped underwater, surrounded by killer Sharks & their air supply quickly running out.
The script is awful, it starts off like some cheap alien film set in outer space but then when it switches to Earth things just go from bad to worse, if the US government knew that a spaceship crash landed in the Ocean why couldn't they find it?
Most of the dialogs are pretty annoying, too: Most of the time you only see the face of one character filling the screen saying his line, then the next character filling the screen saying his line.
Soon, the mice (they look more like rats) see the little guy, find out he's subbing for his dad, and then go to work devouring all the food in the building's kitchen.
They tell him to scram, put on a quick floor show and then punch him out.
Every now and then he would get a little angry.
If you ever wondered what a derailment might look like, then this is it.
"Jackson County Jail" qualifies as one of those great legendary rarities: it's a 70's redneck drive-in exploitation movie that not only delivers the goods and then some, but also the kind of gritty, top-notch, fairly plausible flick that both wholly earns and completely lives up to its killer cult status.
If you enjoy quality television with great writing, then this show is for you.
Getting half way in something (especially crime) and then wishing you hadn't started it is a real factor.
Grimes runs away then and there and the other two join him.
Like a lot of youth back then, when I was young, when this picture was made and today; these kids are bored.
But back then there just weren't any diversions.
To save it, she then makes a bet with the local Minister of Parliament that if she can put on a musical show (Romeo and juliet), and the people like it, the theater stays.
Even then, some of that commercialised coat melted with Madhuri's charm.
But then this movie tells you more about the society & how they think or will say.
If you have to take names, then the list would not end.
She then finds her best friend, Najma, but she refuses to help her.
The first thing my dad did when the credits were done rolling (do stay through the end of the credits because they don't tie up a storyline until then), was to pat me on the back and say thank you for pushing him to come see Aaja Nachle because he hadn't seen such a good film in a long time.
I'm going to see it again this week, then I'm going to buy the DVD--ORIGINAL!
A few lines give you a chuckle, like "And then she inserted her rosary into one of my most private places."
Divine then goes insane and goes on a rampage, and is then put to death by the national guard.
The rosary job is perhaps the finest scene Waters ever concocted and then there's Lobstora, one of the most inspired moments the cinema has ever brought us.
"), but I don't know what to make out of all the dated cultural references (too much Manson/Tate stuff)...then there's an incredibly tedious and overlong delusion with Divine narrating her version of Christ.
If you're looking for something different, but well made, then Green might be just what you're looking for.
Saw the movie, and up to the point,where the 2 Guys in the Ferrari show up it's good...but then...
= Faild in the 1st Driving-Lesson...and then, just to top the Joke...Terry comes back...Is this a joke review of the 1st Scenes, where they where sitting in the Cinema (I think it was Jason) The last 10Min.
And then in pure Pretty Woman-style the kid wants the hooker as his mum and tries to unite dad and the whore...and does it work?
In some cases I'd say this is better then Pretty Woman.
It's a classic boy meets girl movie with that dash of "damsel in distress but is now hardened and tough due to life being so rough and who now finally meets a man who breaks through it all and understands and loves her for who she is" - as far as romantic comedies go- it was better then I thought it would be and even gets the heart strings welling when Ed Harris tells her "this could hurt"...The story itself can be at times almost childish, but in the end that's part of it's charm.
And then there is the pretty funny, long comedy track of a mistaken homosexual relationship between Saif and Shah Rukh.
I have to stop, I'm sorry, just stay away from this movie, plant a tree, watch paint dry, that's much more useful then watching this movie.
The film is interesting and flows well, and then suddenly from nowhere comes Aman (Shahrukh), a happy-go-lucky guy who seems to have no problems in life, but he does want to solve the problems in Naina's family when he meets the rather complicated girl, whom he falls in love with the first moment he sees her.
Aman tries to get close to her and then, when she finally understands she is in love with him, he rejects her!
It is weird, but then we get the real secret disclosed.
See it at the cheap theatre, anymore then a few bucks for this is hi-way robbery.
It was nice entertainer, nice fun, more funny then emotional.
Why did I leave the cinema feeling that if Shah Rukh was given a dialogue full of hope before then end of the film, I'd have felt better...coz surely that was the point of the film: hope.
This was followed by a wave of disbelief, a hope that this was a spoof, then the fits of embarrassed laughter took over and I can honestly say that every film-making mistake and cliche that I could think of at the time was being paraded on screen before my very eyes.
Among the gossip was an alleged brawl between Hurley and director Duncan Roy in which some harsh things were said and then apologized for.
It's an interesting idea, but why-why, why, oh why--would producers spend so much money on period sets, fine actors, beautiful photography, and then use such an incoherent, clichÃ©-ridden script.
On the set Rebecca is more then in her role as the psycho-killer Belle Gunness by overdoing some of the murder scenes that's she's, using axes and knives, in.
We also see the ghost of the real Belle Gunness, Loana Prvelescu, pop up every now and then in the movie giving Rebecca tips and advice in killing off her cast members in the film.
Even the scenes in the movie that Rebecca is staring in come across more convincing and realistic, then those that are supposed to be not before the camera, with Rebbecca and Jake having their affair rekindled after three years.In fact the love scenes that take place in the movie with Rebecca and Jake, playing their roles of Belle and her lover Ray, are far more hotter and convincing then the ones where their in bed and getting it on as Rebecca and Jake.
It's then that it switches to Rebecca playing Belle as if that scene was put in by mistake with the film editors not knowing that she was either dead or imprisoned for what happened in the previous scene!
Strasberg's authoritarian style was legendary as he watched the actors perform scenes and monologues and then proceeded to psychoanalyze the actors and their choices.
I tuned into the first episode of 'Nighty Night' and was bitterly disappointed, but then one of my friends said to me ''Watch the rest of the series, Danny, it does get better''.
Its not to everyones taste but if you like your humour black and politically incorrect with no canned laughter then you will like this.
Rebecca Front gives such a great performance as the hapless, suffering neighbor Cath that you genuinely feel for her and then want her to actually stand up for herself against Jill!
We follow Jill as she tries to convince her husband that he is dying and then proceeds to steal the heart of her neighbour.
If you like shows such as The League of Gentlemen, Little Britian and Strangers With Candy, then i think you will enjoy this show.
Were the show a little more subtle, then it would probably be billed as a psycho-thriller.
It is easier to watch a second or third time if you give it the chance, then you seem to be able to concentrate on the savage humour without feeling too much pity for the put upon characters involved.
In fact, I'd say its much better then the garbage they try to unload now (A show called 24 comes to mind).
For anyone to even think that the Sopranos is not Television then i'm afraid i don't know what the world has come to.
Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist, then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage, and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew, take a break, sit down and watch TV while eating peanut butter out of the jar, and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a Sunday afternoon of viewing NFL football.
(Thanksgiving, it's pointed out, isn't turkey and sweet potato pie - it's the antipasto, the manicotti, the meatballs and escarole, and then the bird!)
It probably isn't fair that I have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the Sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten, but oh well.......  From a standpoint of acting, how could any actor fail with these characters?
To see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed HBO series, "Oz" and then see her as Livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress.
She is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband's business, yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from Jersey.
She is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then Tony himself.
Until then, I will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled.
Pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the "jack-off fantasies" AJ derides (and then into which he promptly subsides).
and if cant appreciate the beauty of that then u don't deserve to watch the movie .
I'm so glad someone's helping," and then deep down, you'll be ashamed to realize that you think that just because you elected to see a movie about Relief Workers rather than The Texas Chainsaw Massacres, you deserve some sort of gold star.
If you are interested in action, romance, and adventure, then I recommend this movie.
So, once again, if you have not seen it, then please, try and make time for it.
I think that people are very much unaware of what is going on in these countries and it is too easy to sit and watch CNN and SKY and say what a shame and then switch off and go on with their lives (Me Included).
I didn't even know about this movie until I chanced upon a trailer of it and then realised it hadn't even made it to the cinemas.
Only then did I know why it never made it to the box office nor even near any cinemas in certain countries.
I don't really agree with some inaccurate plots in certain movies but I don't know the 110% truth about this movie so I just accept it and then find out more about it if I want to.
You want a 100% accurate show, then go watch National Geographic.
That's because it is -- but then again, so was "Blade Runner," with its replicants' difficulties grappling with a conscience.
I can't go a day without thinking of high pitched voice as he spouts the line "We use your dead as vessels", and then a snarl.
It's a shame then that Dark city did not get the full recognition it deserved, I myself watched it on it's opening weekend in the uk, in cinema that had no more than six people in it.
If you want a big, dumb action movie, then go elsewhere - there's noting (for you) to see here.
If one is intrigued by the mystery of our very existence then this kind of movie is surely going to provide some food for thought.
If one day you get up and find that everything around you is just a big lie and the whole world surrounded you is fabricated, manipulated then what will be your reaction.
And then there is a kid with superpowers and has a couple of interesting encounters with Rufus.
then the film can win you over as the hero goes through his version of taking the red pill (or was it the blue one?
First so uncertain, then slowly growing into his role.
They should have turned it into a mini-series on TV then release it on DVD to get the budget back.
Detective Bumstead, played by William Hurt, is on the murder case, trying to bring John in, but is then caught up in helping John uncover the truth.
If you like mind twisting movies that stick with you for days/weeks and make you question the human existence and our reality as we know it, then DARK CITY is the film for you.
It's then that he realizes that something even bigger than his memory loss is taking place.
Everyone that took part in this film should be praised, this is a film that should get more attention from the general public, but is overshadowed by films that like to put more action then story in it's plot.
With an uncanny midas touch, The Warchowski bros launched this(then unknown film) at the the right place, in the right time.
Of course it found its audience but by then its was too late...  That said, the thirst for something better than our run of the mill pop corn fare is still there, waiting to be quenched.
Both movies start with a commando raid and then shift to terrorists hijacking a jetliner before an unconventional hero makes his entry.
If you saw "Airport '77", "Passenger 57", and "The Peacemaker" then you have seen this movie.
It got intense ( but not terribly so) too fast, and then actually let the tension dissipate several notches.
Gary Oldham is every cold-war caricature mixed together, then run amok, all wrapped up in a preposterous accent, overblown mannerisms, and a maniacal laugh.
The whole movie either took itself too seriously or then would get into an Arnold Schwartzenegger type of action movie where Ford would say that little one liner before the big climax.
Like I said, I don't mind an action movie, sometimes I love the most clichÃ©'d one's, but not when it comes to serious stuff like terrorism, but I think I'm speaking from a post 9/11 view, so maybe if I saw this movie a before then, I wouldn't have mind it that much, but even then, there were moments that were terribly over acted and for me, it just didn't work for having a president like James Marshall, please, I wish.
When they managed to take control of the plane during landing, perform several off-road maneuvers with the plane that would make a Jeep proud, then get a Boeing 747 airborne again without benefit of a runway, that's when I went Popeye and decided I'd had all I could stand and I could stand no more.
Sigh with relief when the fax machine stalls, stalls a little longer, and thenÂ just when we'd given up hopeÂ stalls a little longer, and then works!
And then it was simply to liberate the Iraqi people.
There are flaws in this movie but that's how it was back then.
Henry Brandon (best known as Silas Barnaby in Laurel and Hardy's Babes in Toyland where he was then known as Harry Kleinbach) is 10-year survivor Dr. Carl Hunter who initially tries to make a deal for the 3 men to escape in exchange for the woman to stay with him.
The plot is simple, a helicopter crashes into what had, until then, been a hidden tropical jungle in the frozen wastes of Antarctica.
It then becomes a race to repair the helicopter before the dinosaurs eat the entire party.
It starts like a husband-wife story, creates the tension, goes to become a mother-son film, and then explains why it is so, why the son is so, what was his relationship like with his father, what happens to the father, the mother, what the son's wife does, and how the son carries on with his life.
It's a work of genius to capture the essence of "Shawshank", turn it into a comedy, and then squeeze it all into a 21 minute film...It would be great to see Morgan and Alfonso in a movie together portraying father and son...
It takes a lot of effort and skill to boil down a movie as great as Shawshank and pull out all of it's thematically meaningful and emotional scenes and then transcribe them as a comedy that's 121 minutes shorter.
Actors were good considering what they had to work with.If you are going to write disparaging remarks,they should be directed at the editor.They all had to start somewhere.Good movie.James Clayton did an excellent job trying to make something out of the script.I've seen his work in other movies that were written far better and the editor didn't butcher the work.He has a lot of talent.I'll bet money that if he ever gets involved with a dynamic script that allows him to show what he can do,he will be a force to be reckoned with.Don't forget,this is Canada.It is a heck of a struggle just to get started and then even harder to find a project that will do a good actor justice.
Well, what can I say - when the cable channel program guide classifies this as a "Substandard slasher film" then you KNOW there must be something wrong...
We debated whether someone could set out with the intent of making a "film" worse then this one and succeed.
As I am rating it from a child's point of view and have not seen it since then, keep in mind that as an adult, the enjoyment may have run out.
Thsi is one of those movies that was at some point in my earlier childhood that i was obsessed with.I mean this was my favorite movie at the times.Now ill go back and look at this, and obviously I don't love it as much as I did, but I still like it a lot.This film is just so good, and so enjoyable that I can see why I liked it the way I did.Well, now that i understand the film more, i realize that there was some stuff that was not really necessary, and it was a bit to long, but its still a good movie.This movie is just so much fun, and good that its very lovable that anyone could find at least something they liked.Every now and then ill watch this, and remember why I fell in love with this great and funny movie.Overall its a good movie that can be enjoyed by anybody, and is worth a viewing from.
But if that's what you're looking for then this is a good one.
The character mirrored Jones back then, who admits in his biography that he was a dirt bike racing nut prone to losing his temper quite a bit and having an affinity for women other than his wife.
Honestly, I could stare at her all day but if it means having to watch her movies then forget it.
The leader is assassinated and then our heroine (Sandra Bullock), teams up with a whacked out photo journalist (Craig Sheffer) to find the killer and expose corruption.
You then wish the film had taken even longer in presenting its different characters, or perhaps you wish you had paid better attention.
", and then cackles.
Restricted to just one set, he employed what was until then the most extensive story boarding ever utilized for a movie.
I really enjoyed the slow reveals of Willy the Nazi's skills and plans, and the interesting character turns the supposedly "socialist" Kovac shows (becoming enamored with Connie's bracelet, and then with the rich (and strange?)
The film then flashes back to his youth where young "Wes" is practicing his fast draw.
If you're somehow reading this without having seen the film, then do yourself a large favour: rent it, or buy it.
It's probably also uncharitable to point out that Shand is a bit too old school to be taken seriously as a gangland emperor and it's not helped by umpteen films and TV dramas since then showing the London underworld who don't hurt women or kids and who don't grass .In other words it's all a bit clichÃ©d this gangster lark innit ?
But then film-noir usually doesn't.
It is about a man who thinks that he is righteous, accidentally kills perhaps his most loyal lieutenant, and then thinks he can cover it up and redeem himself by committing himself to focusing on revenge.
And then, like a delusional sinner, he thinks that he can redeem himself by finding out exactly who is out to get him.
And only then does Shand see the full extent of his life of greed and lust.
Very much in the tradition of the American gangster films of the 30s and 40s, this movie centres around a bravura performance by the central gangster (Edward G Robinson/James Cagney then; Bob Hoskins now).
A lot of good footage is offered of the band rehearsing and then giving a sensational concert featuring several other artists.
I watched this twice this day and then hollered for my husband to see this.
If you were young when rock-and-roll was young, then you will probably enjoy this; if you were not young at that time, then this would give you a bit of history.
But then, noticing the breathtaking prettiness of his (unconscious) female visitor, Rigby "confirms her existence" by kissing her and fondling her breasts.
The kid follows a group of thugs from the bush to Sydney, hooks up with the daughter of the new US ambassador to Australia, and it basically goes silly from then on.
There really is nothing more embarrassing than having a central character in a semi-violent film, spilling forth a monologue about violence in cinema and how good it is and then topping it off with bad scripting to have another character actually say: "Mmm, interesting.
And then, there are the moments when you are supposed to laugh probably to ease the tension that was never there in the first place.
If you like all the superficial and unrefined elements of a culture, then this is for you.
If you are looking for something more sophisticated and that even attempts to approximate 'art', then look elsewhere.
The insultingly banal plot follows Kyle (poorly acted by American Idol's Jim Verraros) who gets dumped and then is turned on by a nude male model in his art class, who claims to be straight.
If you are in the mood for a comedy classic with Steve Martin, then go out and rent Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid.
If you are ready for a ClichÃ©, stereotypical, and yet totally hot and fun gay comedy then sign yourself up for Sloppy seconds.
He then goes on to insult the director and the writer and that's when I stopped reading.
"The Insider" is a masterpiece.I only saw it because Al Pacino was in it;the theme really wasn't very interesting for me(I though that was the usual "political-correct" film against tobacco),but then came the big (big!)
He then realizes that maybe everything he is doing isn't worth all he has lost, (i.e.
Al Pacino is brilliant as Lowell Bergman, the 60 Minutes producer who struggles to convince former tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand (equally brilliantly played by Russell Crowe) to grant an interview in the face of the industry's attempts to silence him, and then has to fight CBS management to put the interview on the air.
If the satirical lunacy of "Thank You For Smoking" could be akin to the easy goings of Gerber Baby sauce, then this indigestion in the form of a laxative.
And then, in more of a surprise, Christopher Plummer plays one of Pacino's counterparts with perfect pitch.
The resulting mystery and detection results in a story that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but then lots of noirs don't make much sense (The Big Sleep, Somewhere in the Night, Dark Passage).
Some of them are absurd/revisionist (Rachel Ward can hear Martin's voice-over narration) A whole lot of them involve the absurd plot lines introduced by the old footage, that then have to be integrated.
You see both sides of the story and then the whole story.
And then a money-hungry network will cancel it, just when it starts getting the fan support it needs to get ratings.
But every now and then I will meet a kindred spirit, and their eyes will light up, and they'll join right it!
I was a music nerd back then, but was able to relate with all cliques (one of my best friends was a jock).
Other characters are incredibly cruel (including Kim Kelly and her friend who wrote on a geek's locker), but then, high school was like that.
There're the uproarious episodes (like the Halloween one or the Nick Disco one) and then there's Kim Kelly is My Friend (not shown on network TV due to its subject matter) and the story arc following Neal and his dad's disintegrating relationship.
The moment in the pilot when Sam leads Cindy on the dance floor and then the music changes from slow to fast is initially funny, but the pained look on Sam's face like he's about to cry before he awkwardly starts to dance and cheers up brought tears to my eyes.
Then came the scene when Todd thanked the team and the high school and then he thanked God, and I knew I was in for something special.
Only I didn't know right then and there just how great of a show freaks and Geeks truly is!
They are three boys quoting Caddyshack, are bullied for it, and then saved by a girl.
She whispers instructions to the maid to leave the back door open as she isn't really going out, but will pretend to, then have the taxi driver drop her off in the alley.
And then it hits you that the story is not bad either, because its never meant to be that kind of story that tell some events, its a story about life that everyone (more or less) can relate to.
And then, Elizabeth McGovern as Caddie.
The Blowup: 17 January 1960 A woman (Whitney Blake) with a load of unstable, experimental, gunpowder connives to draw Holden and his men into a barroom brawl and then agrees to bail out the entire crew from jail if the captain will agree to ship her volatile cargo to her father's diamond mine.
The best description I could give is that it feels like someone has mixed up the pieces of at least five different jigsaw puzzles and then pulls pieces by random.
It might be the snowboarding, equally lost, American natives that appears on the distant planet mid through the movie, and then just as quickly disappears again.
If you want to see a mixture of the '50's and '60's Sci-Fi scripts and special effects with modern techniques, then go see the movie.
If you haven't seen it then watch it - if you have seen it then watch it again.
If you like Snoop Dogg, then you'll love "Bones."
Here, he plays Jimmy Bones, a gangster who is killed in 1979 and then years later is awakened and out for revenge against the ones who killed him.
It's actually a lot better then the trailers make it look.
May god help us, thank the lord this movie was made in 2001, and our taste in horror has increased, if you are truly dying to watch a popcorn movie on a late Friday night with the friends, then do yourself a favor and rent 'Valentine', the acting is less bad and the storyline can be accepted.
Then, oh man, then the film goes horribly wrong.
He regenerates from having a dog kill people and eat crap and then goes to get revenge on his killers.
This movie wasn't one that was supposed to be taken serious, it has snoop dogg so if you came for a serious movie then you are pretty much crazy...
It Is a lot of fun to watch, it has a a lot of funny moments, a few sad moments a few scary moments and even some dramatic moments but the main point of the film is to entertain, people are really hard on this film because they expected a masterpiece but if you just want to have a fun time enjoying a movie then this one should do!
Hey, don't you think it's kind of odd that someone would stab themselves in the chest with a flick knife and then bury themselves?
If your answer to the above question is "I agree", then you could have been, or may well be part of the team of monkeys that came up with the idea for, wrote and cast this movie.
It's plot is very tired, and it follows the exceedingly boring and familiar tale of someone who was killed being resurrected and then taking their revenge.
If you like Snoop Dogg, then you'll love "Bones!"
It starts with potential and kept it through about 3 quarters of the film but in the last quarter it choked, stalled, and then died.
It also has plenty of things that are clichÃ© then there is the racially clichÃ©.
Getting closer to the end the story begins to follow an illogical line, if Jimmy Bones returns from the dead to seek revenge on those that killed him then why did he do so much more damage and why did the movie end the way it did?
CITIZEN KANE it may not be but no matter - I dug the humor and the atmosphere at the time, and even then was aware of how much work this must have been.
The acting is a bit tireless, yet when taken into context of the genre of the satire, then it places well.
The main things we used back then to attract people were wit, charm, personality and intelligence, along with keeping ourselves reasonably well groomed.
Back then the cheesy video cover screamed cheap-cheap.
The segment ends with the rescuer, who basically admits that he was wrong not to protect the victim from the onset and gives him his pick-up truck which the injured boy then drives away in leaving his "rescuer" in the middle of the cornfield at night.
Issues with the amount of smoking and drinking they do, but then again, who didn't at that age?

The second story is called "O Beautiful" and tells the story of a young gay man who is attacked and sexually molested by a group of homophobic men in a New Jersey cornfield, and is then rescued by one of his attackers who returns after everyone else leaves.
I wasn't sure then if I liked it, but watched the next couple of episodes, and by then I was hooked.
Why did I like this then, you ask?
Kingpin is much more stylish with the camera and music then the Sopranos is and Kingpin hardly eases up there is constant action going on on screen.
series and if it wasn't so restricted on content, overall if you like the Sopranos then you are more than likely love kingpin and even if you don't like the Sopranos you should give it a try for the massive amount of raw energy put in this TV Show.
If you appreciate black and white cinematography, then you will delight in seeing the restored version of this movie on DVD.
If you do go to AOF, then that means you're paying at least 24 grand a year to Mr. LaRoque.
It is a good approach to such a movie too, because you start to think it's a nuclear disaster at the beginning, and then you find out it's actually something a bit worse than that, when the crust of the earth moves, the Earth's balance shifts.
But then again, some people have to believe in the future, because there is always a future, no matter how grim things look like.
If you like something a bit different than big blockbusters, then this movie is so for you, because in Asia they approach everything from an objective point of view, that is what makes their quality.
Seriously, 3/4 of this movie focuses on the main character stumbling around, falling down, and then waddling around on the ground like an invalid.
In fact he's only able to stand long enough to yell at someone (usually the female lead) then falls down again.
I rented this expecting a little out of this movie (the movie's graphics are grade A regardless of the B-movie feel) and got what I wanted and then some.
If I see it again and change my mind, I'll be sure to change my vote, but not before then.
If people want to watch horror movies, then what is wrong with ghosts?
She was as good then as she is now.
But, you've got to see it at least twice...once to let your head adjust to the oddness of the story and then a second time to really experience the multiple levels of terror present in this film, both real and imagined, the most palpable being that lying buried in the human soul.
She is an exceptionally talented and striking actress, and Heart of Midnight provides the then 25-year-old with a strong early showcase for her talent.
If you are intrigued about this movie...then you should see it.
The remaining students are then sent letters by the villains instructing them to cut off their right arm so that their fathers and teachers may be released.
I love this movie with all my heart, so I hope you will watch it and then write the record companies DEMANDING a SOUNDTRACK be released!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I watched this movie on the Disney channel as a kid and fell in complete love with it then!
spoilers -- only parts i disliked even though they were realistically portrayed were the orphanage even though im sure thats the way it was back then for orphans.treated meanly but they at least could have listened to her when she said she wasnt an orphan.and also for the father to just leave his kid behind with the landlady who obviously is a rather loose woman .he didnt have time to watch the kid when he was around as she was always playing hooky or sneaking into movie theatres ,,although during the depression , you did what you did to survive but still he should have considered her welfare more than just to leave her like that, he didnt even say goodbye to her at the beginning of the movie when he left.
The love story between Natty and Harry is so romantic, and the independent spirit of a young girl was rare in movies back then and is still rare now.
My brother was four (4) and I was six (6) and we were enthralled with CB from then on.
After several failed attempts to convince Disney to release a widescreen version, I gave up and purchased a region-free DVD player and then purchased the region 2 version which was in widescreen.
But then again this is the yuppy 80s we're talking about when this film was made, so I suppose it wasn't cool to be wearing anything less than a Label.
The same with Connery, simple explanations so that we can feel for this old time cop and then the scene is set to do battle with the invincible foe, who we don't get to know much about.
Add Brian De Palma and David Mamet, chuck in Sean Connery and Robert DeNiro, then slowly add Kevin Costner, Andy Garcia, Charles Martin Smith and Billy Drago, and whaddya get?
If you think about it then it's a real life story and that's the real ending... well not quite actually Al got out of the prison few years later because of a disease and lived happily ever after.
If you want to see a farce that tries to be serious, every movie clichÃ© in the book (this is no exaggeration, just look for them) an out of place and overdone score, and substandard acting, then this is the movie for you.
And lastly, what good is a large handful of fully-fledged wonderful scenes if you are not going to juxtapose them with something, instead of dishing them out every now and then to keep our interest?
Connery is a given performance wise {accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here ?}
Ness then recruited Jim Malone (Sean Connery), a veteran cop who walked a beat and was well versed in doing things `The Chicago way,' and George Stone (Andy Garcia) a crack shot recruited right out of the Police Academy.
In "Scarface" the focus is on a paranoid and self-destructive gangster who rises to meteoric heights and then falls; in "The Untouchables" the focus is on a very honest man with a noble mission, Elliot Ness (Kostner), who is prepared to do anything to clean Chicago from the corruption and mayhem caused by the notorious gangster Al Capone (De Niro).
And then later, he tells her about Atlantis or the sirens, something incredible, and she has the same reaction.
Let's make it so that he'll be out and about in the sea and completely defenseless, but instead they go pick on a jet plane and then be so kind as to leave him alone when he goes to save the mandatory hot female pilot.
Okay then...  3) Let's embody every character with every clichÃ© trait you can throw at a wall.
If this is quality television to some people, then some people need to get out more.
I see that often in pilots and then the show gets better as time goes on so that could well have been the case here.
this show was blurry to watch on the comp, but has a lot of potential if ever aired, i don't get why they spend time to make it and then tease people like this.
OK, I recently got the pilot off from itunes and all i have to say is if the CW does not pick it up, then they do not deserve to be a network because this show is absolutely amazing.
It's a pity more episodes weren't made -- could've started a new trend -- a canceled show never airs but becomes a hit while viewed on itunes and then becomes a major motion picture.
Supernova, Ninth Gate,...Meet the Feebles pushed me down ten flights of stairs and then savagely kicked me in the groin.
What the want is to get with women but then they find themselves on a mission to save the world.
Here I was under the impression that I finally tracked down a copy of "Case of the Scorpion's Tail" and then it turns out this is an entirely different movie, actually one that is even more rare but also a whole lot worse.
Then I wanted to take comfort in the fact this production stars the almighty B-movie legend John Saxon, but he's only in it during the first EIGHT minutes and then he has his neck wrenched around 180 degrees!
He then gets killed and the wife Joan instantly travels to Italy to investigate the circumstances of his death.
She then travels to Italy to investigate.
And then you had Jorden fake an as ma tack too see the cipher game and Jorden chop down the cherry tree.
For his efforts, Jordan scored a new "boombox" and then an iPod.
I will remind you then that I would also notice more quickly if there were flaws in the writing.
The film see-saws it's way back and forth for Cliff, who alternately tries to play it straight and then gets mixed up with Martin's gangster pals.
And then there's the brief uncredited appearance of Dead Ender Leo Gorcey as the head stock boy for a general store where Cliff briefly finds a job.
If you are a cult film fan, then all the pain you have to endure with a movie like this is just part of the fun.
However, he then is hit on the head again.
I had not realized that William Powell was there before me, but then I must not reveal too much about what he is cooing about, as it might not make it past the Hays Office.
The world is threatened again!, Phillip and Marlowe Â two guys trapped in a bomb shelter for more then a decade with nothing else but canned food and 1940's detective books Â are the only hope.
It was then fashionable to have a presumed saint in residence.
If you don't like history and politics and ancient civilization, you may not like it...however, if you really LOVE these things, then this is one you shouldn't miss.
And then the final scene!
Some of the photography is indeed captivating , if you have never been to Pompeii or to Athens , then you might as well visit them on the screen.
If the 7-8 ratings gets justified just because it is a script showing "reality" then it must be by people who have never seen any other films about reality, try Iranian cinema to start with, you will not see anything as bad as this and if you're lucky even some really good stuff.
The film then pretty much degrades into Mad Max meets the Keystone Cops and pretty much stays there.
The film is pretty boring, there are lots of periods of nothing happening interspersed with rapid paced action that doesn't last long then a bit of dialogue to following and the cycle continues from start to finish.
If hers is also De Oliveira's definition, then all the more so.
And then again, who wouldn't want to sit and have dinner talking with Stefania Sandrelli, Catherine Deneuve, Irene Papas and a charming Captain Malkovich?
This filmed talked to me, while i could do nothing but sit still and wait and listen and watch and then give one of the most sincere applauses i ever could give to a movie.
Part travelogue, part comedy, and part drama, the film lulls us into a state of blissful contentment, then hits us with a wake up call that seems culled from yesterday's headlines.
In itself, then, the film is watchable as an example of low-budget horror from this vintage but in no way a classic.
I then realised that this movie will go down all wrong for conservatives.
He gets it then gets busted.
He's in only like the first part of the movie then sprinkled here and there till the end?
Nobody knew then or knows now that these things had happened to me.
But then editors who drop a whole section of the story probably have no motivation to spiff up the sound track either.
As expected, the movie is a comedic satire for most of the first hour, but then suddenly turns serious in the last 20 minutes.
The 1930's costumes are impeccable and make you wish you could have lived then, when men still knew how to wear suits, and women could look feminine and sexy without looking trashy.
it is a good film but has little to nothing to the book, if you haven't read the book and are thinking of watching the film then i say that you wont get the real story that Dodie smith wrote.
When still at the top of his game Mortmain and his then wife (who later dies, no foul play here) and his two little girls stumbled upon a rodent infested castle which he leased.
An interweaved subplot has Topaz and then Cassandra desperately acting as James's muse, seeking to ignite what may well be the drenched sparks of a one-novel author.
And if life imprisonment actually meant "life" then the pro-capital punishment lobby would not have a leg to stand on.
But then you look at her eyes change when she talks about her life and you can the whites and it is frightening.
Add childhood trauma and then place more intense stress on the individual.
I haven't seen Monster but I did watch Nick's original, so go out and watch that first, then sit back and be shocked, horrified, touched etc.. at this final chapter in the life of someone who did not deserve the life she had.
" No there weren't any gays years ago , they didn't exist back then .
Incidentally, neither title â American (which places an emphasis on the gambling subplot which comes into play only during the last third) or original, which roughly translates to FOUR GUNMEN OF AVE MARIA â is really satisfactoryâ¦but, then, neither is the film itself: one isnât bothered by the sluggish pacing and extreme length of Leoneâs Spaghetti Westerns, but that certainly canât be said here!
Differently from E.B.Clucher, Hill is more Eastwood-way then TrinitÃ  but the substance is the same.
Colizzi was a well competent director, more american then italian, with strong sense of spectacule and correct with the particulars.
Once he gets out of prison, he is framed by crooked banker Harold ("Trinity" alumnus Steffen Zacharias in a dramatic role) for a murder that he didn't commit, and then sentenced to hang by the neck.
That is, until he steals $300,000 from bounty hunters Cat Stevens and Hutch Bessy (Terence Hill and Bud Spencer) who then come trailing after him all over the southwest (or in this case, Almeria Spain) and want their money back.
If you like the genre with a little humor thrown in, then you might like this one.
He then promptly checks the dead security guard for urine.
The movie stops after a hour and then the clownface appears telling that they had another ending of the film too, and they show it afterwards, it's not an extra.
I think that the puppets are more acting then the actors.
It's absolutely surreal(but then again maybe thats why i like movies- anything can happen) I think some will find it politically incorrect, but it's not sending any messages for or against any certain "groups"- other than maybe "its wrong to keep girl bands locked up"?
It's Burgess Meredith, seemingly cowering at first and then realizing that if his life is to have worth, he needs to make a final statement.
In his spare time Virgil has also created horrible little killer dolls to do his bidding, first George Warbeck (Nicholas Worth) & Mercy Shaw (Jodie Coady) are taken care off then Virgil turns his attentions to Harrison Yulin (Warren Draper) & his scheming wife Moira (Debra Mayer) who just happens to be a dominatrix... Has Virgil met his match at last?
Unfortunately her dominatrix scenes are few & far between & once her husband is killed off she becomes 'normal' as it were & the film then dies a slow painful death.
There's also a pointless double ending like in Clue (1985) where one thing happens & then an alternative it could have also happened like this ending is shown which just makes the whole film even more pointless.
He then tracks down better features, using the woman's friends as his own personal parts store.
The director then gives us a convoluted scene at the library, where we know the killer IS NOT, and even a shadowy figure who turns out to be some poor janitor who finds himself looking down the barrels of some dozen and a half police issue firearms.
I coasted along with "I, Madman" on its good intentions for long enough, but eventually the whole thing strayed into familiar territory, and then tried to convince me they were up to something completely new and different.
Only then she discovers that the murders are occurring in real life exactly as it occurs from the novel.
(I don't recall seeing more than bits and pieces since then.)
If wishes could come true, then everyone would watch this film with an open mind if only to find out if afterward, they were still willing to throw the first stone of "righteousness".
Every church congregation and Sunday School Class should see this movie as one audience and then have their own discussion.
My favorite moment in the film was when one of the scholars challenges these religious leaders to obey Jesus's commandment to sell all you have and give it to the poor and then you can follow him.
I was so moved by this film I feel if everyone was at least willing to see it then it would open a dialog desperately needed in our country.
If not, you will find yourself losing more brain cells by the minute then Cheech & Chong did during the entire decade of the 70's!
One of them dresses in drag, he looks ridiculous and then they start to have a stupid conversation about where he's going to pee!
When she does appear on a fractious colt, bantering lightly with Our Gang's Stymie, and then her guests, her character is drawn and limned deeper by a trip to Pres' bank, where she interrupts an important meeting.
Drive In Massacre opens with a juicy double murder which suggests that the film might be something of a treat for lovers of outrageous 70s gore flicks: a sabre wielding maniac graphically kills a couple at the drive in, decapitating the guy whilst he is adjusting the loudspeakers next to his car, and then skewering the screaming girlfriend through the neck.
Well then you'll love "Drive-In Massacre".
He then becomes ill with the plague & dies.
If you're interested in film making and the criticism behind a blood soaked genre, then Horror Business is a must watch for you.
If you're into the idea of film making, acting or if you just love the genre, then Horror Business is a must see for you.
But then it's back to the reality Â he talks with Canadian Brian Singleton who has had to return from Florida to live with his parents and try to continue his dream with no money.
you follow a beautiful girl with big breasts and a nice smile going through some stupid situations.If you want to see what the life a supermodel really is rent GIA.Gia is a little dramatic but a least is true.I cannot beleive that a Canadian director made this trash.Too much hype around a movie that did not deserve this kind of attention.Stay away from this trash.If you want to be bore then rent it.
Ever wonder what the value of "Beauty" has to the World ?, this film "Stardom", defines it to a "T", and then some.
So, if you feel that you have gotten the short straw in life, then you will really enjoy this film, watch for the Freud quote, it is memorable and historic.
Bette Davis then only 30 years old, won an Oscar for best actress for this movie in 1939.
The media - from "legitimate" reporters to Jerry Springer style talk show hosts - are portrayed as scheming, incompetent, sensationalist sycophants who will do whatever possible to get the story, build up the stars and then spend the rest of the time trying to tear them down.
As has been said; It does not do the fine job that French Connection did, but then can you really compare the two directors (William Friedkin vs Howard Koch)?
Things aren't a lot different in 2006,it's just that Hollywood likes to make us think they are.I'm not saying for a minute that it's right that things have barely changed in 30 years,but no amount of wishing will make it so.Professional criminals still hide their activities behind the poor and disenfranchised of their own communities,ferment trouble for their own advantage and cops like Eddie Ryan still hate them bitterly for doing it.Laws meant to protect the weak and vulnerable still shelter the cruel and ruthless.If Eddie Ryan,like Harry Callaghan before him,feels like chucking in his badge then he cannot altogether be blamed.Not that he gets a chance as his bosses pre-empt him.
I haven't seen a lot of movies from the 1930's but I'm pretty sure that no one else was doing then what Bette Davis was doing.
I am still baffled at how this kind of crap gets backing and then money is spent to promote it, and then it's distributed, etc.
If you like to sleep in front of the TV , then go out and buy or rent this movie, and you are guaranteed to have a goodnight sleep !
I dunno..." he speaks that he doesn't think of his work in conscious terms until _after_ he's drawn it; then he figures out what it's about.
While his two brothers, Charles and Max, both show in differing degrees how their youths were permanently scarred then, Robert Crumb emerges whole, even admirable, in spite of the uncompromising nature of his art.
I like ambiguity, and I don't need thing spelled out to me, but is Davis heading towards certain death with her true love or is she going to nurse him, then give him up to Lindsay?
Maybe if it concentrated on the "Yellow Fever" epidemic it could have been (but then, the 1938 audience had also seen MGM's YELLOW JACK, and was aware of how to tell the story of that scourge).
But then stereotypes abound in GONE WITH THE WIND (to its detriment).
From girlish delight, to arch queen and dignified royal, flirting with Tyrone Power and then the deep love she felt for the dauphin.
The scene where they take the dauphin away.....and then they come for her son, Shearer goes from sheer disbelief that they could be so inhuman, to fighting them off like a tigress, her hair and arms flying around, before they call in more guards.
I shall view it, and then give my opinion.
Three quarters of the film revolves around MA and then suddenly, there's a revolution is in full swing.
And then there's Morley's apparent indifference to her.
The second half turns a little darker, but then, as they say, it's always darkest just before it turns completely black.
Thousands of yards of satin & lace, a then gigantic 1.8 dollar million budget plus hundreds of extras made this movie one of the most opulent epic's of the 30's & shall forever shine as one of the most glamorous ever made.
You first start the movie with Marie Antoinette finding out she is to be married to Louis the XVI, then during the film so much goes on that you sort of have a hard time keeping up with how much time has past in her life, until finally you get to the crucial part in the film where her and her husband are to be executed.
It does get a bit more disturbing as it goes along, and we see Kersey acting first, deliberately getting himself into situations where he might be in danger, and then blowing people away before they even have a chance to go at him.
Death Wish makes a simple point: if the law can't or won't protect innocent people, then maybe someone else should.
Yes, of course it is, but then so is the liberal tradition of accepting violent crime as a "normal" aspect of society.
Those of us old enough to have seen it then can understand what I am talking about.
Apparently the public loves him, and cops don't want to look really bad by not being to protect people and then arresting the one person that is fighting back and inspiring others to do the same.
His wife (Hope Lange) is murdered and his daughter is gang-raped into a near-comatose state by a gang of thugs (one played by then unknown Jeff Goldblum!).
I knew that there was also a kind of historical context for the times, of how it was in New York City as well as in others during the 70's (though especially in the 70's)- I remembered my mother telling me about how the atmosphere of 'Death Wish' with its thieves and rapists and abusers was for real, that they were around every corner, and that crime was indeed at an all-time high then.
So if you are expecting to see some action - this movie isn't the best choice but if you just wand to see a good vigilante-thriller, then you may like it.
I think this is nonsense, since if this movie is violent, then what about others like "First Blood", "Commando" or "Rambo" just to name a few?...
The story then slows down as we see the transformation of the husband, from conscientious objector to vigilante.
What's so unusual is that in the movie "Death Wish" he played a man who was a pacifist all of his life, he served in the Korean War as a conscientious objector, who then turned into the vigilante executioner!
A role which Bronson has become known for and identified with more then any of the scores of actions roles that he made during his long film career.
All this with the ineffective, in stopping crime, police being more interested in stopping "The Vigilante" then stopping the criminals!
There's been many times when average people took to protecting themselves, with firearms, and did a much better job then the police; which is just what Paul Kersey did in the movie.
When Bernie Goetz in December 1984 gunned down four muggers, much like Charles Bronson did in the movie "Death Wish", who tried to attack him in the New York subway crime dropped a lot more then if one hundred policemen were put on the trains.
If the law is fighting a losing battle against the criminal element and can't protect innocent people, then maybe someone else should...
But still then, beside this the whole story became a sweet and funny love story.
And then he just as conveniently dies, an unopened letter beside him that Elizabeth and Lawrence somehow fail to see.
He puts the moves on Arquette, then ditches her when she resists.
She has been kind of lost since then but the way she plays totally clueless and still manipulative is really superb.
Once he leaves that loft apartment, however, then all hell breaks loose.
The film then becomes very fast paced and the events that transpire in regards to the main character, a cute little guy with a weak chin and some eyebrows that need plucking, is terrifying to the utmost.
"My idea then was to pull back, and not to become hysterical and try to kill people.
So the trick then was to try to do something."
I love the whole bizarre set up, the weird coincidences (for example the piece of newspaper stuck on his arm which talks about a man being ripped apart by vigilantes in the very area he can't get away from - and then the weird woman says 'I'll burn it off' - yet more reference to burns) Love the 'Berlin club', and the idea of the plaster of Paris cream cheese bagel paper weights - so evocative of that pretentious era!
If you like cleverly written, unpredictable stories then this film is for you.
But then Paul meets Marcy in the diner and the fun begins.
Marcy's cream, her trip to the drugstore to get it, the book of gruesome pictures that Paul can't keep himself from...then Marcy floats back in (he slams the book shut) and what is she holding?
Why does the movie just stop dead right in the middle to present a couple of nightclub acts, then just pick up again like nothing had happened?
Malcomb then switches Eddie's DNA with the DNA of someone (something?)
His slaying is done behind a screen and we see him pounded into hamburger and then having HIS limbs torn apart.
True to her manipulative nature, she then schemes to have Fonda and the hot-headed gentleman, George Brent, get into an argument.
It takes a while for Ira to get to the bottom of what's been going on between Birdwell and the Whitings but with the help of screwy pseudo-philosophical Margo, who turns out to be a lot smarter then Ira at first thought, he puts all the pieces together.
Ira who really got on the case to find who murdered Harry Regan finding Winston was only secondary for him and gets a lot more then he bargained for including a brutal beating by Lamar ,who he later pays back with interest.
In the end he finds not only who killed Harry but a new place to stay, Margo's place, after his landlady kicked him out of her house for giving her more headaches and excitement then his rent could compensate her for: $42,50 a month.
I saw this film when it first came out nearly 30 years ago, and then watched it again recently.
In many ways Carney's performance in "The Late Show" is better then his performances in his other two great films of the seventies, "Harry and Tonto" and "Going In Style".
Virgyl then finds the girl of his dreams and stands up for her in their US History class.
Don't rent this movie in a hurry but if there's absolutely no choice then rent this one at least none of your friends will insult you.
Not that I expected something more than that, but why have a sense of reality then?
If you don't mind paying to download movies from an authorized download site and viewing them on your PC or renting "sleepers" from your local Movie Rental location, then its up to you to see it.
We are all happy that the geek finally got the dream girl, and that he beat up the jock, and the dream girl realized how great a guy the geek was, and then all of a sudden, the geek wakes up, and the whole crazy plot we watched was just a dream, it didn't happen.
First there's the huge saucer that sits atop a building; then there's the pseudo-Godzilla monster the aliens create (with a funny-looking jaw that reminds one of the Emmerich-Devlin Godzilla).
THIS one kills the human who tried to kill him and then burns down another half mile of Tokyo as an afterthought!
She won her second Oscar for Best Actress in this film and as her aunt who occasionally gives her a reality check every now and then Fay Bainter was named Best Supporting Actress of 1938.
I rented it, sat down and watched it, and then, three quarters through, I just turned it off, ejected it, and returned it.
If you think I'm making this up or am being too harsh, just wait until you see the movie, then go rent some of the movies that were made from 1991-1995 and tell me that they were honestly far more advanced.
No Japanese track was a disappointment to begin with but then as the commentators just glad handing themselves about there edit's, re-written dialog and complete disregard for the original film I realized this was just a ruined film.
Godzilla 2000 Millennium also has moments of humor as well as scenes which give us insight into the lives of the people tracking Godzilla and who must then deal with an even greater threat.
It's always hard to figure out where the movie exists in the Godzilla canon (there are basically four eras: The first two movies, the movies after that up until the initial series ended in 1975, then the revivial in the eighties that began with Godzilla 1985 and ended with Godzilla Vs. Destroyah, and now this film), but it seems to begin another era of G-films, with no apparent links to any of the other ones, other than the original movie Gojira.
Just then, Miyasaka finds that the giant rock follows the sun, so it starts to fly away and heads toward Godzilla, the two titans shoot rays at each other, and in the process, Godzilla is defeated, and the rock is revealed to be a huge, solar-powered metallic UFO!
If you enjoy Godzilla then you will be pleased with this film.
If you own this on DVD and you live in the USA, then please watch it on the "Audio Commentary".
Something much better could have been done rather then them just "getting away" in a very improbable event.
It is easy for me to say that Julie's red dress was much ado about nothing, but then again, this is the millennium, when nothing is overtly shocking anymore.
Each of the four keys are stored separately so finding them & copying them is the first thing Edward & his men need to do, then the hard work really starts...
If you like crime heist films then this is one of the best.
If you are asked if you ever tell the truth and you deny it, well then you are lying in your response, which means you must be telling the truth.
She then went to England, in violation of her contract, with the intention of starring in a movie without Warner Brothers' approval.
Brian tries his best to leave, but with the poor weather condition he is forced to stay put and slowly the two of them become friends and then more than friends.
The acting is better then some serious horror movies and the effects are incredible.
This is a fun little spoof of the crappy 80's style horror flicks we grew up with... the twist (the same kinda hook that Scream used about five years later) is that the hero is a guy who's seen so many of said crappy horror flicks that he realizes that he might actually be IN a crappy horror flick, then uses it to his advantage.
Justa funny dog movie where the dog is more human then dog and nobody seems to notice.
Foster child (Chuckie) finds dog but can't have him, then dad (who is NFL kicker) has to work some where else, and Chuckie tries to take Bingo but leaves behind.
The film lumps together elements borrowed from "Lassie", "Rin Tin Tin", "The littlest Hobo", "Skippy the bush kangaroo" and many more and then gleefully turns them all on their head in a brilliant parody.
The movie was directed by Turi Meyer, but maybe it's supposed to be Russ Meyer; because, there's an abundance of female body parts exposed for no other reason then to ...well...be exposed I guess (reviewer blushes).
Maybe the writers could have given Todd more dialog then.
It was filmed in 1952 but not released until 1954 and then came out on the bottom half of a double bill.
They then go to Penner's hideout where Sully (Mack Chandler) and the psycho Johnny Haslett (Timothy Carey) await them.
If only the movie had not tried to continue from the first sequel with such a senseless premise and had decided whether it were a horror or a soft porn film then maybe something good could have been created.
If itÂ´s blood that you want then check this one because thereÂ´ll be lots of it.
If you want a creepy, scary well-done movie, just watch the original Candyamn, and then if you liked it, go watch Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh, but stop right there.
This is actually quite boring and galaxies away from the quality of the original,  If you have nothing to do and everybody's out having fun and you're home alone on a Friday night and eating cold pizza and thinking how the hell did your best friend got your girlÂ well then this might be for youÂ if you want to feel REALLY BAD.
At least then you'll be entertained.
'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers', 'A Nightmare On Elm Street 2', 'Childs Play 3', and 'Candyman 3' all have something in common.If you're thinking that they're all sequels, you are right, but there's something else.All of these movies are examples of underrated sequels.I liked all of these movies and I don't care what other people have to say about them.I thought that 'Candyman 3: Day of the Dead' was a pretty decent horror movie with another groundbreaking performance by Tony Todd.Nobody will ever play a better Candyman than him.That's a fact that we horror fans should know.I haven't seen the 2nd movie yet, but I do have to say that the first and the third were pretty good.Maybe the third wasn't as good as the first, but I still found it to be a good movie.After you're finished reading my review, I want you to go to a mirror and say Candyman 5 times.If he shows up and tries to kill you, then it serves you right for thinking that this movie was totally pointless.If the Candyman franchise wants to be really popular, then there needs to be a 4th installment.Let's hope that Tony Todd is willing to play Candyman again.
Thereafter, the recruit settles in the Ironbound section of Newark, NJ, and is responsible for many of that area's unsolved murders and missing persons since then.
If you couldn't care less about Paris Hilton's latest fiasco, or even better, you don't know who she is, then this movie is for you.
This is the first 10 minutes of the film, then the remaining 90 minutes is all talking,(low key), It does get more dramatic towards the end.
If one has heard it once then we have heard it a million times, books rarely get translated into faithful or superior films unless of course the book is about 10 pages long or pure drivel.
You know he'd knock you down and then pick you up again, and besides, he's compulsively watchable.
After an extremely well shot and directed opening the film then never managed to live up to the expectations created by such a prolific beginning.
STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs   One day,novelist and science lecturer Joe (Daniel Craig) takes his girlfriend Claire (Samantha Morton) out for a picnic in the beautiful English countryside.He has an ulterior motive-he means to propose to her.But then,suddenly and completely without warning,their lives are changed irrevocably forever when a red hot air balloon falls from the sky and a desperate struggle ensues to save the people on board.A man is killed and Joe is plagued with feelings of guilt and failure for sometime after.After a while,he does his best to put the incident behind him and move on with his life.But there's one person for whom doing that obviously hasn't been so easy for-fellow rescuer Jed (Rhys Ifans) who begins obsessively following Joe everywhere,leading him down a nightmare path of fear and madness.
The friend I saw the movie with enjoyed it and was engrossed in the story, but then again he hadn't read the book.
This is not meant to suggest that professional actors should work for peanuts...suffice it to say that, while "Saving Star Wars" (http://www.savingstarwars.com ) is clearly (and correctly, I believe) critical of the parts of the second trilogy that were then (2003) known, it is a lovingly critical work.
The plot followed a much-used noir formula: the man whose past comes back to haunt him â as an ex-con (Gene Nelson) is forced by three fugitives (including Bronson and Ted de Corsia), after deliberately compromising his parole and threatening his wife, into first harboring them and then take part in their proposed bank robbery (by which time theyâve enrolled other dangerous elements to their fold, notably a typically-nutty Timothy Carey).
The narrative, then, tries to cram in as many recognizably noir elements as it possibly can: suspense, violence, romance, location shooting, documentary approach (via a systematic police procedural), etc.
From then, we primarily follow Enid (Thora Birch), who finds herself in an existential phase of her life, having escaped from her hated experience, but finding herself in a meaningless and pointless world, with little direction of her own.
If there are original movies left in this world, then one of them should definitely be Ghost World.
Symbolically, she understands that if she can get an outcast like Seymore to function in society, then maybe there is hope for her too.
My best fiend saw it with me too, and we have been a lot closer since then.
If you're a lover of film noir, then buy this on DVD today in a classic film noir set #4 and watch the whole set and start your own wave.
First she feels sorry for Seymour, then he becomes something of a hero to her, and she resolves to help him at least find a girlfriend.
John asks Alex to bring Sayid's backpack with the explosives, and then he goes to the submarine to destroy it.
Before long I suspected that Conan Doyle had no connection with this story, apart from the name of the main characters, and from then on it became a game of 'spot the anachronisms', of which there were too many to count.
I would have thought he would have realised that aristocratic girls back then did not 'pass out' but rather fainted.
But then most of have have been spoiled by the late Jeremy Britt, undoubtedly the best Holmes ever.
Unfortunately, then I watched the program and I was really disappointed.
We then have to wait for Holmes to play catch up.
If holmes is believed to be born in 1854, then in 1903 he is 49, Rupert Everett was about 45 when he did the film so he was certainly in the correct age range.
In fact if stories are really to be done faithfully, then from 1887 to 1893, the actor in the role should be between 33-39.
But then, perhaps he did need it to feel excitement.
If the answer is yes, then a bad story is still pretty good.
If the answer is no, then whatever other attractions the story holds are worthless.
If you're a Montgomery fan who hasn't seen this yet, then put it on the top of the list, because it's a brilliantly moving film, and her performance is well done.
The story involving a girl who does not die during the twenty-minute gassing and is then revived and how the men argue over how to protect her from further harm, is intense and touching in that it shows the humanity that is still in their souls.
It is a better movie then "Schindler's List" which is avowed to set the standard for movies about the Holocaust.
This film concerns the crews of Jews who were forced to lead their countrymen into the gas chambers at Auzcwitz and then dispose of the bodies in cematoria afterward.
", the desperate prisoner shouts at Arquette, and then Arquette loses his head and attacks this man to death, breaking his skull with punches and kicks, not really moved by angriness, but by sorrow and pain to recognize the awfulness of the truth spit on his face - yes, even him, Arquette, can't believe he is doing this, and the outlet of such sorrow comes into the forms of him losing his head and degrading and smashing a fellow Jew's skull to the death.
If you want to learn about a great rebellion that took place in Auschwitz and you don't want to read a book about it, then watch this movie.
It was then that I realized that I would have probably done everything that every Jew did during the Holocaust.
If you're a fan of the movies of David Lynch, then you will most likely enjoy this.
If you're not picky about movies making sense, then this might well be for you.
I don't like giving bad reviews, but then I don't like being sold something that does not work, and for me I was sold something that did not work.
But if you love a romance, that is about love and what love should be, then this is a film for you.
), then you can watch this movie and see what all the buzz is about.
Well, if you have, then you know what i'm talking about.
The Red Skull is only the Red Skull for about five minutes, then because I guess they could not afford to keep making him up so they make him look stupid for the rest of the film.
Captain America goes after the Red Skull beating up Nazi soldiers then totally gets beaten up by the skull that doesn't look like a skull, but it is still creepy.
Cap gets tied to a rocket which is launched at the White House then he diverts it to Alaska.
If you like Marvel Comics, Captain America, and the cast mentioned above then I recommend you watch this movie!
It basicly starts out with a few minutes in one place, a few minutes in another, a few more elsewhere......you get the idea, and then all these separate incidents gradually and slowly lead to one single plot.
A year later, Gray is engineering his train, the General, which is then stolen by Northern spies and used to halt supplies to the South.
Gray pursues the train by handcar, bicycle, and engine car, then after rescuing his girlfriend, who was on the train, the tables are reversed as the spies chase him Gray, on the General.
He sat and watched the end of the movie with me, then he actually started it over to watch the whole thing.
He sat and watched the end of the movie with me, then he actually started it over to watch the whole thing.
Dad's favorite part was also mine, the part where Keaton sits down in the conductor's seat to find an obstructing rail car that he just disposed of has miraculously reappeared, and then a moment later he sits down to find that the car has vanished once again.
If one is new to Keaton, knowing only that he was a deadpan comedian who performed hilarious yet often dangerous stunts then this will be something of (in the words Oscar Hammerstein put into the mouth of the King Of Siam) a puzzlement; it boasts a more or less straightforward narrative in which engineer Keaton's train is stolen by Union troops during The War Between The States and he sets off in pursuit.
He chose to represent the south because even then he knew his was a dying art form, one that was eclipsed almost instantaneously.
Because they did not have the technology back then to edit it like it was something else.
Things are then sped up a year, where we see some Union commanders planning to hijack a train to unleash a highly sophisticated master plan.
The film is slow-starting, then hilarious action comedy, often voted one of the best films ever made.
Johnny eventually is the only person who tries to retake "the General" from the raiders, and the film has actually two chases in it - first Andrews and his men stealing the train, and then Keaton sneaking into Northern lines with Mack and retaking it.
Who else in Hollywood would sink money in a spectacular effect and then downplay it?
The hero-worshippers are ready to follow, but Johnnie lets them out first, then closes the door on them.
Annabelle kisses her father and brother as they go to enlist, then turns expectantly to Johnnie, who cocks his head like a confused puppy.
As a bonus, the third performance in film, by the then 8 year old Natalie Wood, as an adorable little blond Austrian exile girl.
One is crazier then the next.
Decades later, they've put it out on DVD and I've found it to be almost as good as I remembered thinking it was back then.
As others have pointed out, if you remember watching this on TV then this is an excellent piece of nostalgia.
All I had to do was crawl for about 15 feet and then walk right on, and that is exactly what I did.
And then not even all the acts and songs were captured, as Geldof had originally requested that the event not be recorded!
Even if you want to be cynical then you can't deny that money was raised and it went to humanitarian Non Governmental Organisations ( NGOs ) that saved countless human lives .
There's no need to emphasize that LIVE AID (and everything else connected to it) is the singular event of the rock'n'roll history, greater then anything seen before or after.
If Jerry Doesn't have fat midget Lesbian wrestlers from Mars on then this a substitute
It is interesting to see a film such as this, where no expense has been spared, with great MGM art direction and costume design, intriguing choreography and movement, the then novel CinemaScope cinematography, and realizing fairly quickly that is simply does not hold.
He starred in 20th's biggest production of 1954, "The Egyptian" -- after Marlon Brando turned down the part -- and then starred in this, MGM's biggest production of 1955, and yet this almost unprecedented, one-two whammy of multimillion dollar spectacles failed to ignite his acting career.
And the story itself, about outlaws on the run with Lynda willingly going along for the ride, is pretty exciting in a trashy kind of way for a while but then gets too repetitiously redundant by the end.
This is one of the films on HBO then which made me think that the "B" Hollywood films were alive & well in the 1970's.
And then everything changes in an instant -- an instant captured by the young photographer's first photograph.
If the writers had wrote a better ending, giving a meaning to the whole scene of meeting the aliens, then I think the movie would have lasted for about 10-15 more minutes.
But then again, the movie is about 3 teenagers having their dreams come true and not so much about meeting aliens.
I seemed to remember the film being an interesting romp back then so I decided to give this film another watch.
They then do test runs like any good scientists would before they decide it's ready for a much bigger journey.
Now then, with the exception of the outer space scenes, this film easily keeps your interest.
The movie goes to some trouble to set this up, then proceeds to do nothing with the character, who manages to find out what the kids are up to, and simply watches as they fly away to meet the aliens.
They then take their device for a rather humorous test drive, but near the end of their first run something seems to take control of their ship...they avoid disaster and then another dream shows them how to make a device that seems to provide air.
And then there are director Joe Dante's touches.
Once it began, it was easy to see the premise and then I decided to have it become a guessing game to see who was behind all of the action.
She's troubled by the strange noises she hears in the building, and the strange events that cause her to dial 911 and then find that there's no real emergency.
She plays Daisy Rain, a would be actress who plays what I call the Janet Leigh character: remember the very first time you saw PSYCHO and then boom the whole story dynamic shifted?
If it wasn't for his 1974 video nasty The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, then we may never have seen movies like Slumber Party Massacre or any of the other slasher 'massacre' titles.
It was somewhat ironic then that he decided to direct a remake of the 1978 gruesome slasher (The Toolbox Murders) at exactly the same time that New Line Cinema were renewing his very own masterpiece (Chainsaw Massacre).
The movie then goes on a few years and we see Boy swinging through the trees and swimming.
A search party then comes looking for the plane and then discover Boy is the young couple's son.
the fact that the studio got three films in a row from the plot line shows the films have more to them then the well worn plot lines.
Problems ensue for Mike as Dora's angry father walks in on them, then pushes marriage or prison onto poor, poor Mike (seems our little waitress was underage).
"Dis" might be the worst Norwegian movie ever made, (it have some really hard competition), but at the same time it have something else, it was a box office smash hit, not for the movie, but for the laughs, if I remember correctly, over 300,000 Norwegians watched this movie at the cinemas, and that more then the avarege movie here gets, it packed full houses for weeks.
The price of the video then was approximately the equivalent of two cinema tickets.
by Mr. Aune Sand himself) since I was about 40 years older (then) than the very young female teen-agers who had lined up to buy their copies.
We, then, were left to watch it.
The film is full of totally comical parts like:  When the film opens with a REALLY long sequence with Siv Stubsveen tossing and turning in the bed for 5 minutes - and then she tell us in her thoughts - "I couldn't sleep".
But the biggest problem is that it rushes up to the parts where Paul is courting Linda, then loses it's steam pretty quickly once Paul and Linda get married and the Beatles break up.
Soon they discover that a nightclub owner Al Taurez is involved, but very soon our heroes discover to their disappointment that he's a bit tougher then appears to be at first sight.
And then there are some films, that mislead you with the tagline, cover of the film and in some cases the preview.
Julia Roberts, was certainly not at her best, but then better than her non-deserving Oscar award winning performance in "Erin Brockovich."
The only saving grace is the dance sequence - but then I can bet there have been infinitely better results than this.
It's a fairly well-made film, for a low-budget feature and one of the only two movies you'll find Dorthy Stratten in, so if your a Stratten fan or interested in brainwashing, then go for it.
Basically, this is a story about a woman(Julia Roberts) who finds out that her husband(Dennis Quaid) is cheating on her and then everything gets mixed up from this point on.
The INS officers storm into a tomato plant, chase down the workers, beat a few of them mercilessly, and then line them up in the dirt outside execution-style.
Until then, we can only hope filmmakers will have more integrity when exploring such territory.
At first, he wants nothing to do with him as he, too, is in the states illegally, but then becomes a father figure, realizing the chiquito needs all the help he can get.
She demeans herself daily cleaning the house of a wealthy woman who treats her like a second class citizen and then has to clean another house and sew dresses nightly in order to put any money aside.
So if that's the single most mind blowing and fascinating concept you've ever heard of, then you probably still shouldn't bother watching this because it's not like they explain it.
But then a trip to a second-hand store for some shoes convinces him the story isn't what he thought it was.
She is then arrested, convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.
While I would've never--not then,probably not now,either--thought this to be anything of great work,it's still a blissfully wonderful comedy.
There are comedic gems that have gained respect over the years, and then there are comedic gems that have slipped by unnoticed.
I saw it three times and by then, that was enough.
He starts putting out books and Jr. High track medals to impress her and then when she arrives he can only grunt at her greeting.
He then proceeds to fling his jacket across the room and knock over a lamp.
This is Herbert Ross' adaptation of a Woody Allen play, but it's done in such a way that from start to finish it resembles the type of comic fantasies Allen himself would direct in the latter part of the Seventies and from then on.
The best advice that poor Allen gets is from non-other then what seems like the ghost of Humphrey Bogart, Jerry Lacy, himself.
It's not until Allen is alone with Linda who's husband Dick is out of town on a business trip and then the sparks really start to fly.
It's then that Dick and Linda board the plane thats leaving for Cleveland and out of the now wiser and far more confidant, thanks to Humphrey Bogart, with women Allen Felix's life forever.
Humphrey Bogart now knowing that he's no longer needed as Allen's guardian angel then goes back, by disappearing into the cold and foggy night, to Hollywood and movie heaven to the music of "As Time Goes By".
But then there's Diane Keaton's Linda, who is already married to Tony Roberts's character, and they're all friends with Allen too.
If you love old movies, or great comedy, or Woody Allen and Diane Keaton in their early prime, then PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM will still deliver the goods 30+ years after its first release.
Unless you're scared of mass numbers of insects (on a TV show) and you like to watch 40 minutes of the most boring investigations of 'Supernatural' so far, then you should give this episode a shot, otherwise feel free to say that the first season had only 21 episodes like i said.
His advice to the kid to just get through the next 2 years and then escape to college, really confuses and hurts Dean.
Also, I like the realtors trying to sell Sam & Dean the house, first assuming that they are a couple and then that they need the house for their "elderly" father.
":{ If you are a guy and love nudity where it shows the top and the bottom for at least a half of a minute in each scene (which to Me it seemed to be days before a scene ended) then hurry up and find and buy this movie IMMEDIATELY!
)He gives a terrible performance like everyone else,but then he was probably having his daydreams of staring in epic tales of epic frontiers and district attorneys who root out presidential assassins,unlike the other stars who just faded into oblivion after this film was made (there seem to be a few who think Costner should have done the same,but,there you go...) The film was made in 1986,but looks more like it was made in 1976.The dodgy lighting and wooden sets are here in all their glory,obviously a very low-budget effort all round.Yep,this is definitely another one of those 'before-they-were-famous' efforts that linger at the back of the CVs of stars like Costner like flies on sh*t.*
I like movies in which the characters are kind of Â¨mysteriousÂ¨ at the beginning and then become clearer as the film progresses.
She is sexually starved, but then refuses a life with Ramillo.
After a while I forgot about it, until last night, it was on again (the satellite had been fixed by then).
He gets through partners rather quickly too, since they die, become super-powered ghost partners and then get re-incarnated.
Wasn't sure about getting a DVD and then it was on Comedy Central.
The plot may be criticized as silly, but then so can the plot of most musicals.
He's arrogant, he's self-absorbed, extremely egotistical, oblivious to his own failings and glaring incompetence, indulgent in pampering himself with metrosexual treatment every now and then, has an eternal (1) grin and (2) crush on Leila, and never stops torturing his poor alien subordinate Kif who (1) does the real work all the time, (2) gets credit none of the time and (3) takes the blame every time Zapp screws things up (which happens quite often).
I think that if you love The Simpsons then you will definitely like Futurama as Matt Groening has done a brilliant job changing from series to series which is a very difficult thing to do.
Hope this kind of helped, but if you skipped all these explanations and came to the bottom I heavily suggest watching this show and start at the first first two episodes of season one and then have fun with the rest (5 season total, 4 volumes of DVD's).
Leela then turns to Fry's side and the three find Fry's only living relative, Professor Farnsworth, who employs them in his delivery company, Planet Express.
If you like Bo Svenson and the rest of the cast in the film, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and interesting films from the 1980s then I recommend this one!
And then when he left the video store, they showed more minutes-on-end of Andy just peddling home.
First of all, the story is about a kid who watches a magic HVS tape and then sets off on an adventure to something called the "colordome" to save someone, or something.
Only then did they discover he was dead.
The sparkling "I'll Be Hard to Handle" is first introduced by Ginger singing in a mock foreign accent, then she and Fred execute a joyous tap dance that is part of a rehearsal.
Fred and Ginger then dance to "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes".
This one had more and better action then the first 2, and better acting and plot.
There was better characters, not to mention more then in the first.
this was obviously done on a bigger budget then the first one, and I think they tried harder to make this then they did in the inferior predicessors.
(I think it was a store) Of course this then gives way to a moronic story with bikers doing things that only the wimpiest bikers do.
Interestingly enough, there is one blond bombshell Â but she only gets once scene and then is forgotten rather abruptly.
It didn't work then and it didn't work for Pearl Harbor.
It is always a shame to see a movie that starts off with such a great storyline, but then falls apart at the end.
Def Con 4 starts off well, but then digresses into a boring plot line with forgettable characters.
At one minute it's a high tech space thriller, the next a grim survivalist tale, then social satire and finally a big, stupid shootout.
It's a grim, grimy, somewhat distasteful endeavor for sure, but then again so was the prospect nuclear combat toe to toe with the Ruskies.
The music consists of some familiar tunes, including the haunting "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes," sung by Irene Dunne and later danced by Astaire and Rogers, "Lovely to Look At," sung by Dunne and then danced by Astaire and Rogers, "Yesterdays," sung by Irene Dunne, and, of course, "I Won't Dance" - but they do.
Following this rather well done sequence, they are quickly brought down and then one of them is just as quickly devoured by starving, irradiated homeless teenagers... and it just gets campier from there.
If you enjoy bad sci-fi films, then look no further.
The story line starts off well but begins to worsen not too soon after the start, and gets worse and worse and then plateaus and then gets worse again.
The ending is finally reaches the so bad it is good stage, but if you watch that far into it, as I did, then you are a fool.
Having said that, then, there is the dancing of Astaire and Rogers, unmatched by anyone before or since.
But back in 1939, not even the roller-coaster ride was in anybody's mind, and film portraying pirates might have looked ridiculous even then.
When confronted by a "lesser person" about how similar they are and how he's no better then anything else, Laughton nearly foams at the mouth.
If sinking your teeth into over-ripe fruit is one of your pleasures, then Jamaica Inn should be your dish.
But then the film has yet another surprise for us -- Laughton's character becomes more and more irrational until we reach a point by the end where Mary realizes along with the rest of us that he's actually completely insane.
In the Nineteenth Century, in Cornwall, a group of pirates leaded by Joss Merlyn (Leslie Banks) uses false beacon to misguide ships to wreck on the rocks of the coast; then they kill the survivors to rob the cargo and gather in the Jamaica Inn, a place of ill fame.
In the end a beaten and broken man ,looking at least twenty older then he actually is, Matt Brady who even his long suffering and abused wife Lorry couldn't quite bring herself to feel sorry for is seen walking into the state penitentiary- Leavenworth- with his trademark Cuban Cigar dropping to the ground as he prepares himself to spend the rest of his life behind prison bars.
The romantic angle however of Payne being in love with Doe Avedon who married best friend William Bishop and then marrying plain Jane Gloria McGehee in a moment of drunken weakness is a complete fabrication.
It was great sharing it with him and his mother and as I almost knew the dialogue by heart by then, I understood every word.
But then there is an even greater irony inasmuch as Holly too is drawn to Harry; after all they have friends since boyhood.
And then the ferris wheel scene, and the chase through the sewers that no doubt helped win the film an Oscar for cinematography.
And then there's Orson Welles...
If someone is telling you the album you made 10yrs ago is your classic album, then there is a definite belief that there is not much else left to come.
But then there's a dumb twist thrown in near the end, and both Paltrow and David Suchet as the detective (who, as played by John Williams, was the best part of the original) are left twisting in the wind.
She is also tough and resourceful enough to survive the attack, and then smart enough to put the pieces together afterward.
But, since only one out of one hundred (at most) of the people seeing this movie have ever seen/remember Dial M for Murder, then logic dictates that 99% of the population will enjoy it considerably more than the 1%.
Steven approaches David and lets him know that he knows everything about David's past and then blackmails him.
And lastly, an Adam and Eve scene with Mr Diderot chasing his wife around the garden naked with the Baroness and Le cardinal (Michel Sarrault), the very dramatic one watching.And then, the Cardinal sniffed table salts and the Baroness says:" I feel queasy!
If you are offended by vulgarity; if you hate Benny Hill, and can't see the fun of Barbara Windsor's bikini popping off; and think that concept that breasts have nipples is outrageous; if you think broad humor is a pointless waste of time then this really is not the film for you.
If you thought that France = sophistication, therefore this must be high-brow: then I simply suggest that you get out a bit more.
I had to go to great lengths to first obtain a PAL copy from France that has no English subtitles, download a subtitle file online, and then use 3 different programs to rip the DVD, process the video and add subtitles, and then burn it to a DVD I could watch on my TV.
The film starts with a bawdy song unmistakably naughty and then follows ever so much suggestive but clever dialogue.
The Major is desperately short of both men and ammunition to hold off the Vietcong who are trying cut off his supply lines and then overrun his weakly defended outpost.
Though operating on a meager budget, this is a film that says more about the frustrations of the Vietnam war then almost any of it's extravagently budgeted brethren.
If you want a feel for what was going on then, watch.
I hope and pray that London After Midnight is found in some dusty old attic one day but until then this is what we have and I applaud TCM for trying to satisfy the fans who mourn the loss of burnt nitrate from MGM;s vault 7.
The movie features a whole lot of characters that don't get properly introduced (but then again, how could they).
*   Their scheme is to let the French develop the wrong land, then steal it out from under them.
Listen to his calm discussion regarding his "putting away" hat with Wayne, or his care as a scout watching Wayne's capture, following him from a distance in the dark, and then heading for assistance.
If this is the first action movie you have ever seen then you *might* love it, otherwise it should be avoided at all cost.
If Travolta were playing his role more tongue-in-cheek and the movie itself were touted as a comedy, then it might be palatable.
If you're ready for a McGyver episode, then this is what you should watch.
The problem is, it was immediately followed by the Jerry Bruckheimer action flick "The Rock" and if you've seen both of these movies then you'll know which is the better.
If you haven't seen either of them then pay attention because "Broken Arrow" is a shocking effort from arguably Hong Kong's finest director John Woo.
Elizabeth has a son from her first husband and then a second from Lawrence.
Hale manages to eject from the Stealth before Deakins kills him, Deakins then drops the unarmed bombs & ejects himself leaving the plane to crash.
The only scene which really made me cringe was when Hale falls off the back of the truck & he then picks himself up, runs after it, catches it up & jumps on the back!
It takes only about 6 minutes to get going, and then, boom!
If you like action movies filmed entirely in parking garages and spooky allies, then you will not appreciate the settings in this film in America's majestic West.
If you want to see a little of the real Japan then watch this movie rather than "Lost in Translation" (which would have been better if it was filmed in New York so the director knew what she was talking about).
He's a lackluster man when Claude FranÃ§ois isn't on his mind but when his passion for Claude FranÃ§ois has the upper hand and his determination to reform his female dance band make his demeanor with his surrounding hateful, obnoxious, on the brink of the unacceptable as the sequences when he selects his female dancers and then asks her questions (he has all the answers) about his god bear witness.
An outstanding performance then from him but also from his two co-stars the beautiful Julie Depardieu and the always disconcerting Jean-Paul Rouve.
She then gets to run around in a shirt that's been slit up the sides so that you still frequently catch views of her crotch and buttocks.
This movie starts off with a woman running naked in a field and being targeted by a crazed hunter and is then shot dead.
As said, if seeing half naked strippers do their thing on stage or if you enjoy watching women captured, stripped naked and then hunted like wild animals then don't miss this one!
The ingredients were there and then some.
The first part takes up most of the film, in gripping intensity (and yes, no porn at all) it builds an incredible tension - and then we get a maybe oversimplified, but ultimately satisfying solution.
However I now recall a 1987 direct to video movie filmed in Australia where a bunch of outback lowlifes terrorize a woman then decide to hunt her like prey.
She turns the tables on them by, yes, getting really angry and then going after them with hand-made weapons.
I won't be a hypocrite who enjoyed watching attractive Danielle DeLuca run for her life in the nude and then criticize her later for doing a nude role in a B thriller movie.
At times the movie came to life due to the liveliness of some of its characters and then the poor production values intruded to detract from this movie.
And then there is Wallace Ford, who was just okay in this movie and who was also underused.
The opening with the title names put on shades drawn throughout the opening title sequence had me at once, and then actor Charley Grapewin, Uncle Henry from The Wizard of Oz and Inspector Queen from the Ellery Queen movie series, comes on and chews up so much scenery with his cantankerous old codger bit that you end up loving his character from the first moment you see him.
The movie then quickly gets down to familiar but nonetheless pleasing business as the camera focuses on Charley Grapewin, who quickly and cleverly explains to his assembled relatives what nice round figures each will realize from his $6 million will, provided of course that his long-lost grand-daughter doesn't turn up before the clock strikes twelve.
As the reviewer on IMDb says it confounds your expectations by allowing things and people to survive and for events to unfold differently then you thought... (Read The IMDb comments after you see the film since they give too much away) Basically this is about an old guy who was going to give his fortune away to friends and relatives because his grand daughter can't be found.
Well, the granddaughter arrives in the nick of time, however, then another young woman shows up claiming to be the granddaughter.
And then, maybe predictably, as the latest news breaks right in front of her, she automatically turns into a relentless news hound!
This is a smart movie, it has plenty of plot and character development, it has great strong characters, it makes commentary on the newsbusiness then that is relevant to the newsbusiness today and sarcastically shares the modern view of government I think, as well.
If you haven't seen this wonderful piece of cinematic whimsy then go see it, its kinda cheesy 80's but if thats a bad thing for you, its definitely worth seeing thru that to see such a unique talent that you may never see again anywhere else on film, and to be cheered up despite your self.
Back then ethnic politics were played to the hilt and a law and order mayor, Clarence Kolb, wants to see Qualen executed.
He cons her into helping out with a controversial death row case and then makes sure her fiancÃ©e (Ralph Bellamy) suffers a series of mishaps - arrest for stealing a watch, arrest for "mashing," arrest for counterfeiting, and the theft of his wallet.
This all happens while Hildy interviews Earl Williams, a man due to be hung the next day... and then hides him in a roll-top desk in the courthouse press room when he escapes during a psychiatric evaluation.
he is then brought back from the dead by a crow when the legend says 'Love is stronger than death'.
It was then lost in the streams of time and I totally forgot about it.
The other villains, made up of the five corrupt officers under his command and his blonde secretary/lover, are cookie-cutter antagonists who show up only to harm innocents and then be beaten by the hero.
In both Crow sequels, the villains are introduced and then they face off with The Crow.
Frequently visiting their home from then on to have tea or breakfast, Recep starts liking the elder daughter, Nihal.
I do not know if another versions of this movie in other languages exist, but if it does, then everybody who sees cinema as an interpretation of pure feelings must watch it.
"Birth," however, imagines that the coincidences (maybe written as "divine" or "psychic" interventions) enable the boy to slowly become aware of his previous incarnation, and then its sins.
The high rating I give it is based ENTIRELY on what a 9 yr old boy would have rated it back then, but it's all I have right now.
If you ever get to see the film then make sure you do.
You should watch the whole show, though, if you expect to understand any of it (even twice won't hurt, if you'll like it as much as I do), but only after seeing the sequel "Higurashi no naku koro ni kai" (which is not half as good, and can't really be called "horror") you'll really understand more then a few pieces.
They'll be cute and bouncy for one moment, then murderous and psychotic the next.
If you like movies that explore the darker side of humanity, then you will really enjoy "Birth."
If you think 50 cent's acting was horrendous then you haven't seen anything yet.
It has no originality but if you are in for a good laugh then by god this is your movie right here.
If you enjoy horrible acting and corny exaggeration in a story, then this is the movie for you.
(Some Spoilers) More like a home movie then anything else "The Sex Killer" plot is your run of the mill sex pervert film with nothing to recommended it but a number of pretty girls, who for the most part end up getting strangled, and a look at the grimy streets and red light district of Manhattan circa the mid 1960's.
It's then that something inside Tony's sick minds snaps and sets him off to stalk down and murder a number of young women, including the hooker whom he picked up, mostly in their apartments that Tony breaks into.
Unfortunately Tony didn't seek help and it was after he crossed that point of no return when he went from watching to murdering the women that turned him on that there was no help that society, other then long stretch behind bars or a cops bullet in his chest, could offer him.
They were then blindfolded for 'security reasons' and, ammunition being scarce, hit on the back of the neck with metal bars before being cast into a pit.
Did Anna write her dead husband a letter mentioning where he died and then did that letter fall into the hands of Clara???
The film lacks a straight plot in the conventional sense, it just cruises along, relaxes, and then cruises some more, as do the characters: sensitive Curt has to decide whether he is the competitive type (and runs into a street gang while he's at it), All-American Steve contemplates life with or without his girlfriend, dragster John manages to breach some of his untouchable daredevil image by baby-sitting the twerpy Carol, and Terry the Toad finally gets himself a girl (and what a girl she is).
It could have been a masterpiece if George Lucas had tinted his romanticism with a bit more irony, but then, "absurdity" is not a word commonly found in the blockbuster dictionaries.
If you really want to see "wimmin who shag in ze name of exposing traitors to ze Fatherland", then you have come to the right shop (again).
If, like me, you prefer your Nazisploitation loaded with gore, perversion and nudity, with a generous side order of camp, then you would probably be best advised to goose-step straight past Red Nights of the Gestapo.
It is not about young people protesting against society, it is about a man that wakes up and discover that everything he stands for is "shit", and then gathering some folks to start a revolution against the entertainment industry and television companies.
Having been a late comer to 'The Wire' series on the FX channel in Britain then when that finished they advertised 'The Corner'.
I wasn't interested in it for the first few minutes, and then I saw Shyamalan's name come up on the credits as writer and director.
If more people saw this gem of a movie, then more would love it.
I didn't think I would stumble across this movie unless I bought it online but then I got a job working at a video store and there it was.
I think if I had written a review for it back then I would have given the movie a 1 mostly because of the horrific ending that makes no sense what so ever.
If the movie had kept this going and had an amazing ending then I think the movie would become something wonderful but some reason the writer just seems to have run out of ideas and just gave us an ending that should make people want to throw things at the screen.
The movie begins with a man running and then collapsing.
We don't know who the man is, why he collapsed, or what happened to him because the movie then cuts away to the birth of a child.
The infant then grows up and comes into the life of the widow of the man played by Nicole Kidman as a ten year old boy who claims that he is her former husband.
He demonstrates this to her by an intimate knowledge of their married life together and the question is if he is not the reincarnation of him, then how did he gain such knowledge.
Early in the movie there is a scene in which the boy sees another woman bury a box, and then go to a party given by Kidman and the boy follows the woman to the party.
It is more serious then I realised for an O'Connell film.
It could have been a funny scene, but they had to push the envelope from a funny misunderstanding to sheer homophobic panic - he has to be shown vomiting and almost kill himself just to leave - and then if that wasn't tasteless enough, they added a scene where he's mistaken for a pedophile!
If you want to laugh and watch a movie that is so completely underrated that I want to complain, then please go, buy a copy, rent one, what ever you have to do to be able to see this hilarious movie.
If you try it and it didn't suit you then at least you tried something new.
Nonetheless, if you want a light romp through relationship land then this is pretty darn light reading.
If you liked this, and you should for what it was (Ebert could lighten up but then again he probably can't be PC and give this movie anything more than zero stars), check out Tomcats - similarly funny and original.
Yet it soon becomes apparent that this is far more then that.
We died and never knew, But well or ill, England, we died for you" is a poem, in its original form, which was written during The Great War of 1914 - 1918 and then used, in part and in principle, as the title to the Alberto Cavalcanti (1897 - 1982) directed Ealing Studios film Went the Day Well?
Complacency is not the order of the day during the then real threat of a German invasion.
This is the purpose of this film, and it does it very well and even then if it fails in its job to stir up nationalistic pride, then, perhaps, the day did not go too well.
Gradually the villagers begin to suspect things aren't right, and then realize what they're dealing with.
We see a lady driving in her car, singing to herself, we then cut to the home guard being mown down on the road, their bodies cleared just as the woman drives round the corner.
The most frustrating feature of this film is that it promises a memorable journey within the first ten minutes and then ignores it, ignore us it cheated us.
He kills a cop then passes off a masquerade of being one.
We then get to see him as young man working at a meat packing company.
And to them I would like to say please enroll in the service, head over to Iraq and see some real f**king gore so maybe then you'll all stop trying to act like bad asses.
So to sum up I guess I would have to say that if you hated the remake and found no redeeming value in it then 'The Texas Chainsaw: The Beginning' is not for you.
Not for the faint hearted and far superior then any of the Texas Chainsaw's before it.
Probably her best moment Â beyond the scene where she hides under the table as Leatherface has his way with her boyfriend, is the quiet moment where she stands at the door to the Hewitt home, staring at freedom, inches away, and then reluctantly does the right thing and turns to proceed haltingly upstairs to help her friend.
So yes, a little of TCM the Beginning will feel like 'old hat' but then again we're not talking Shakesphere here.
The film featured a handful of deaths, only one of which was committed with the titular weapon (and, even then, only shown a few drops of blood); the movie was an absurd comedy of sorts, shrouded in a gritty, documentary-style realism that fueled the terror brewing beneath.
"The Beginning" then dives into a story we've all seen too many times before.
If you want to watch a good old fashion blood and guts horror movie that delivers on the darkness, the atmosphere, the killing, all that makes a horror movie good (and not bad as is lost on most movie reviewers) then see TCM the beginning.
I for one am glad that movies like TCM the beginning come out now and again to the same Criticisms that should be praised rather than scored, but then again i am of a generation that applauds the blood, and Gratuitous violence and dreary depression or horror, instead of going eeewww thats gross!
That is just my general overview if you are the type of person who wishes to see a huge hulking serial killer demolish people, rather than some little bug eyed kid, or old man with a fisherman's hook then by all means see TCM the beginning, otherwise stay home and complain about the lack of all elements that have ruined most horror films over the past decade.
If you love gore, suspense, terror, and the symbol of all that is just plain wrong then The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning is just your slasher!
Anna, the woman who suffered the great loss in her life fights the boy when he appears, then, as everything points into the right direction, or what she wants to believe, and she gets answers that have been inside her head all the time, she accepts as natural a situation that by all accounts if far from normal.
This well to do family, who is at odds, first believing, then seeing what it has gone to Anna.
That's all done within the first 20 minutes...then it's just a virtual redo on the original with four likable 20-somethings being captured and tortured by Leatherface and his family.
But then maybe I'm just a sucker for sad-eyed, medium statured Italians.
There are movies I've loved the first time, then thought on the second time around, hmmm, maybe not as good as I first thought - State of Grace, Fight Club, for instance.
The song eventually made me remember about that film of which I read positive comments some time ago and then I found out that Waits' version was originally released on the soundtrack of that film, pretty much it was time to finally give Becker's Sea of Love a shot.
It is then someone rings at the door and what a surprise, a colleague of his, a cop, Â you go and discover the details.
I do not know how many times I have seen this movie since the release in the movie theaters, then on VHS and now on DVD.
Since then I have caught Sea of Love about a dozen times on cable and still to this day enjoy the thrilling drama.
then you're living on the high land and soon enough, you'll fall off A hole!
I then watched the movie again and caught some of the more subtle cues, words and actions happening in this movie.
This will evoke some kind of feeling, if it doesn't then I seriously think you weren't able to appreciate it!
But even then, she shows no curiosity whatsoever about the apartment, where we know the proof exists.
The lower class is no more then a machine that can be operated by putting in quarters.
Ron Moody, then has the money to free his dog from the Pound.
The dog is then rescued by our two heros !
He then has to face the bureaucratic robots (people that run the dog pound) to get his dog.
It then is very clear on screen.
It becomes clear, but then it changes directions and goes towards the camera.
Although I normally do not like comedies (I prefer subtle humor in films that are about something else then just making jokes), Shouf Shouf Habibi definitely put some smiles on my face.
I read a comment about this movie being Dull,Â´WellÂ´, then Dutch culture has its dull sides, are you willing to see beyond!  
Yabe then receives a phone call from Taguchi -- which is impossible -- and goes to his apartment to find Taguchi's body gone (of course) except for a black smear on the wall where he was found dead.
You'll be watching a girl finding a corpse still hanging from the knot in one scene and then literally 10 seconds later seeing her again at some place apparently unaffected, smiling and going about.
Anna then develops an obsession with the child, throwing her engagement to Joseph (Danny Huston) into confusion.
Kairo, or Pulse as it's known amongst English speaking audiences, is set in Tokyo & starts as Sunny Plant Sales employee Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) decides to visit her friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to enquire about a computer disk he's been working on, when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her.
If you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly PG rated stuff all the way.
A good look and feel to it though, and a scene with a low-flying plane on fire that then crashes out of sight is particularly eerie.
The director just sets up the camera and keeps it on a space and then has things slowly emerge from the sides - he has you start to look and scope and wonder if you are REALLY seeing something as opposed to the lazy, bloated SHOCK moment of most US horror films.
If you can stand slow calculating horror films that freak you out with images and implications then see this movie.
"I just remembered that when I was a kid, I ate like 6 things of Pop-Rocks and then drank a whole can of soda!
We are then are able to feel for Sam and understand his reaction after the secret is revealed.
None of the plot makes any sense, characters come and go without rhyme nor reason (in fact Roundtree is killed at one point and then appears again a few scenes later - and he isn't playing Jesus!).
The biggest disappointment is reserved for fans of La Collins - she makes a tiny cameo appearance moments before the end, for no good reason, then the film finishes.
It is sad to report, then, that A Game For Vultures is an absolutely disastrous film which misfires in every conceivable department.
Every now and then to spice things up, Kosugi puts in an appearance and it's no coincidence that these episodes are the best of the series which sans his presence is somewhat pedestrian at best.
But If you have seen Ichi the killer and liked it give this film ago as at then you can make your own judgement.
And of course we then hear all his buddies congratulating him.
The soldiers capturing a house in the field and then losing it, Murphy blowing a tank, shooting by mistake at himself in the mirror, standing on a tank in flames, throwing grenades at a pillbox, crossing a river under fire, whatever you think it is there, and in Cinemascope, which adapts very well to the widescreen format.
I watched a run of this movie on the History Channel, it was a show called, is it 'History or Hollywood' where by at the end of the show 3 Historians discuss a movie for Historic correctness, every one said if anything this movie was under stated of what Audie Murphy truly did in Europe during WWII, one said it was down played because of Audie Murphy himself, because his Army recorded as witness by others has him doing lots more, but that was the personality of Audie Murphy, imagine watching a movie were the battle's and the deeds are true, they called out a seen where Audie's best friend gets shot, he really did go ballistic charging at the German machine gun nest that killed him, picks up a German Machine gun then proceeds to take out 2 or 3 more gun sites, by using the German gun it didn't give a warning to the Germans, he saved countless American lives coming up that mountain, a brilliant movie.
and the man who's more afraid of them then in love with them.
This is another Fellini movie I'd watched many years ago, in my late teens, and didn't like at all back then.
It all starts with a hostage situation at the British embassy in London, where RAINBOW team is called to intervene... and then, various missions, most of them based on the original novel's situations, and a secret, deadly plot comes out from behind this sudden terrorism wave.
I had always thought that because South American countries, with the exception of Brazil, speak Spanish then it seemed that national boundaries would play only a minor role; but as becomes clear in part two that is most certainly not the case.
Before they know it Castro's men were ambushed by Bitista's-the then Cuban Dictator-soldiers with only about a dozen, including Che & Fidel, surviving the carnage.
It's then that Castro Che & Co. showed their true colors, Deep Commie Red, in what they planned for the Cuban people that they just "liberated".
There we understand him better and believe him, but then there are moments when he irradiates pure rage and is so natural and convincing that we wonder where he had kept those emotions the whole time.
It's a smart move to have each of the both part of this epic start out with geographical maps of first Cuba, and then South America.
Che's interview and then we see flashbacks of the revolutionary struggle.
This may not be everyone's cup of poison, but if you like your biopics done with depth and intelligence then this is the film for you.
And then through lush tropical terrain, fighting to overthrow the regime in power until 1959.
How ironic then that his execution has sparked a 'cult of the revolutionary' that has not diminished over the intervening 40 plus years since his death.
If this is the case, then this trilogy will indeed constitute Steven Soderberg's masterpiece.
One must live as though they have already died, then the fear will be gone and you can do what is necessary for the cause.
If not, then you probably have his face on a t-shirt somewhere and you didn't know.
Steven Soderbergh refrains, then, from counteracting the magnitude of Che: Part One's dense political platform by ramping up the fireworks.
If your understanding of certain political ideals and movements are, at best, hazy- then it's best to steer clear of this one.
If this means that we may not get exactly a fully rounded portrait of its titular protagonist/hero, then that's probably the only real liability that the picture has.
He is then hired to help protect a trainload of silver make it through rebel territory to the States.
It has an interesting structure, since the bulk of the film is told in flashback before returning to the beginning and then reaching the grand finale.
I think that Seplhie and Irvine should end up together and that Seifer and Quistis should end up together and then Zell could end up with the girl that like him from the library which is a side storyline which is good and gives you the chance to get to know more about the chracters and what they like.
The first sex-horror film!claimed the tagline.Well for that matter,Murnau's "Nosferatu" came first.Claude Mulot's script is thin,mean and lacks humor and substance.A poor man's "les yeux sans visage" indeed.But it manages to retain some -minor - interest.The castle where a lady who was disfigured in a fire (Duperrey) is waiting for a doctor who will give her back her beauty;but this man's methods -blackmailed by the lady's husband - are illegal to say the least for he needs warm young flesh,well you know the score.We never see the lady's horrible face ,only her eyes -like Rosemary's baby- ,and there's a lot of camera taking first-person point of view.Two sinisters dwarfs appear now and then .Claude Mulot sometimes manages to create a dreamlike atmosphere,but once again,his script is really half-backed.
The appearance of her scarred features, then, is subtly handled throughout (presented mostly as blurry POV shots) and the make-up itself quite well done.
In THE BLOOD ROSE (released as RAVAGED in the U.K.), he again plays the surgeon who aims to graft the face off a live victim: here, however, he's blackmailed into the task and actually doubts his own success (his eventual fate, then, comes as a total shock).
The story is that of a man who has married the woman of his dreams only to have her horribly burned and scarred and then finds a former doctor to restore her.
The movie does a really good job focusing on their childhood leading to the establishment of the Republic of China, and then the sisters' associations with important figures in China's history.
I think that Seplhie and Irvine should end up together and that Seifer and Quistis should end up together and then Zell could end up with the girl that like him from the library which is a side storyline which is good and gives you the chance to get to know more about the characters and what they like.
We cry as we see Ching-ling lose her baby, then her father, and finally her husband, as if it was the price she paid, for loving her country.
It was easy to cheer for this gang of misfits back then.
Quitting and adopting a counter attitude is present from then on.
and then you have examples of good sportsmanship winning out.
It's tough to call "Bears" a family film or a kids film for that reason, but then again, some kids would really benefit from the values.
If you balk at the fact that it becomes a little unbelievable at times...remember that FAN-tasy equals FUN-tasy and then be on your way.
A comedy about an area rarely touched until then in films (a scene in the James Garner - Kim Novak comedy BOYS NIGHT OUT was one of the few that dealt with Little League before this full study of it), THE BAD NEWS BEARS is a nice reaffirmation on what sports is supposed to be about: fun.
Back then, many of my friends and I wished we could be Tanner or Kelly; we wished we had the courage and independence to tell an adult to go to hell and say or do whatever we wanted.
I had first played this game in the year 2000 and i thought then, what a great game, now, almost 7 years on i still think it is one of the best RPG games.

I would love to see that edited some more, and then an update on what has happened since.
I suppose so, then.
I hope this gets the chance for distribution because if any doubters watch this and is not moved by the fight, the sadness from the personal stories and dedication from these people then you can't be human.
I would like to see the mom find a school that was during the day only to take care of and teach her son and then she could have her days free to pursue her own interests.
But then, I think the same thing about myself.
Foster and his crew dress in masks Â in fact, none of them except Foster know what any of the others looks like Â and drive a truck made up to look just like the florist's van, then split up and agree to meet at a to-be-specified-later date and split up the loot.
After an ingenious robbery, an exÂcon is framed ,then released; he decides he has earned a share and is willing to obtain it.
With KCC, these seem _pastiched or quite borrowed (yet they are still functional and did not get the _movieish character of later pastiches that are merely laboratory abstract products)Âbut then again, such the things were the good of a whole era in cinema Â.
Eventually, the authorities discover the abandoned florist delivery truck, but by then Joe has lost his job.
If you enjoy a good Adventure/Romance, then this is clearly for you.
Subsequently I think that if this film is intended for people to show to their parents or mates to illustrate metal in general, then it scores highly (although the old story about Satanism and Black Metal is a little over done - we've heard all that before).
If you like punk, then you would enjoy American HardCore as well.
Wood, a blond here, is absolutely adorable and very accomplished, speaking German and then English with a German accent.
For instance, on the one hand you get the perspective of groupies, and then of groupies from bands.
We missed the first hour of this 4-foot slog (thankfully)and then giggled through the rest of this abysmal Antipodean crap.
One has to wonder why they spent those first 3 weeks building those wonderful living quarters instead of a raft which they could have used to get OFF the island, but hey, then the movie couldn't have lasted as long as it did.
Some of the characters are also reminiscent of the Gilligan's Island castaways such as the character of Lucille, who starts out as a snotty yet beautiful Ginger-type then turns into a fledgling Samurai under the hallucinogenic tutelage of a dead Japanese soldier because she just happens to be fluent in Japanese (as well as Vietnamese) and managed to translate the dead soldier's diary.
If you were fascinated by the "Banned from Television" series or more circulated material like the Real TV show and all the "see it to believe it" programs on the tube, then Traces of Death is the obvious next step.
In this one, it's the musical version of the moral fable "The Wise Little Hen" with Florence Gil voicing the one who asks Donald and his friend Peter Pig (Pinto Colvig) for help in first planting the corn and then harvesting them.
If your trying to take the movie seriously and looking for quality, then this movie probably deserves 2 stars, however, if your looking for some trashy, guilty pleasure, camp entertainment then this movie scores.
One shocking scene has Farrah getting slapped round by her husband in their bedroom, he throws her on the bed and then unzips his pants practically in her face,(hinting at forced oral sex) She later develops a relationship with a private investigater whom she hires.
It's no surprise, then, that this marked the last of Jeffries cowboy films--being the fifth in a series of very inconsequential low-budget Westerns.

Marty runs, and then it fades to present day, which when the movie was made, was 1992.
They then identify themselves as NSA, tell Bishop that they know his real identity, and ask to meet with them again for a special assignment.
The level of sophistication of the electronic tools used in the intelligence community was surprising then and made me wonder what kinds of things were really possible at the time.
Bishop (whose name back then was Brice) was outside the building at the time and has been wanted ever since.
If I feel this way, then you know , other's must feel this way also.
It is a fun film and is enjoyable to watch, but if you are looking for a true spy film, then you may want to pass.
Back then, to think that a chip that can control the world was preposterous, but now, with almost everything microchip-controlled, and the ubiquity of the Internet, that thought is not too farfetched.
And then there's the moments.
Maya the shape-shifting alien, though well acted by Catherine Schell, is a terrible idea (good on paper, not on screen), with makeup different in every episode and then the tendency to transform only into Earth animals.
American producer ( and the man who assassinated 'Star Trek' ) Fred Freiburger was brought in first as a head writer, then as producer.
Or then again...maybe not.
The emphasise of style over content is here for all to see, with the excesses of the 80s for all to see (I'd like to say we have evolved since then but I am really not sure).
If you are a not a Turk and especially do not know anything about Cem Yilmaz (the actor), then it would even seem silly to you.
Lawrence (George Brent) steps into her life to assist then eventually they marry and create a reasonably happy life together.
Forget "The Last Ride", just watch the historic GTO video, and then return or throw away the DVD.
Flynn was a tragic figure, a larger then life adventurer and lover who 's reputation, after death, naturally, was smeared by a several books, now proved to be false.
Let me start off by commenting on the acting by giving a witty analogy: If someone told you to eat a burger filled with cat turds and then act as if you enjoy it, you'd eat it, and try to act like you enjoy it.
Forward 1 year and then back to the jackhammer to the face scene.
She then slaps him with the drill bit, and he falls of the building top, where the scene was taking place.
They hit him a few times, then inject what one can only guess is speed into his neck in an attempt to kill him.
If you like B movies where you like gore, then pick this up.
So then .
Now then here's the stuff you were waiting for.
The oil billionaire then sends out a couple of hitmen to stop Golgo 13 but he stop`s them to and at the end it is only Golgo 13 and the oil billionaire again and you have to see the movie to see how it ends.
Sure the CGI in the climax is kind of laughable by today even though back then it was a little cheap and the storyline is very compelling as well as the old school type of animation here.
If he accepts a contract then he always hits his target.
This movie does start off as a take on the novel: ten people are stranded in a remote location, they all have something in common and then the killing starts.
And then " I'm going deep deep deep, deep undercover. "
I don't want to give away too much so all I'm going to say is that this is a well-done scary movie that starts out as a drama about a bunch of people and how they end up stopping at the same motel and then 1-by-1 those that are present start dying.
Why go through all the trouble to cast someone like him and then only show him for 5 whole minutes!!!!
If you want to watch a horror, a mystery, a action, and a murder film then see Identity today because it has all of that in it!
The main standout in the first reel is the use of Tarantino-like "multiple viewpoint" shots, where we see the same span of time from one character's point of view, then another, then another.
It starts off as a classic "Whodunnit" movie but then flips and twists on its head so many times your left astounded.
Danila, the hero played by Sergei Bodrov Jr.here reminds us of some well known character from action films(Travis from "Taxi Driver", or better to say,James Bond from "007" series).Hero with firearms,who never loses in love affairs and in gunfight, who revenges his friend's death, protects potential victims of villains, saves good people,and then goes back to motherland with new girlfriend.
He get to the BIG BOSS and demands his million dollars, and then goes home victorious.
a legendary movie and a national favorite but if you don't understand the Russian way of life then keep away as the truth in this movie could scar u pretty bad.

But then all of a sudden they made NO3 which is the worst one out of the series.
As far as plots go, it's not the most complex out there - but then again, you have to constantly remind yourself throughout that it's a kids' film.
The film plots around the fact of new criminal's in Beverly hills and that after every crime they do they leave an envelope marked with a letter of the alphabet leaving the Beverly Hills Police department with giving them the name of "The Alphabet Crimes" the criminals start there crime by robbing a jewellery shop and leaving an envelope marked with "A" then secondly they shoot Capt.

You might think then this is for adults, for moms and dads, to watch with their children... nnnnno.
The movie then is not for children, nor their parents or anybody else.
I haven't seen the cartoon of Dennis the menace, but saw the movie as a kid and thought it was good back then,but watching it now i have realized how boring it is.
I saw this film when it first came out and I loved it then and still do so I'm pleased to have finally bought it on DVD.
then he scopes out the town and says, "i bet they don't even lock their doors."
Nick Castle directed this hilarious family film that did better then what people give it credit for today.
Lea Thompson is great as Dennis' mother and Christopher Lloyd is so delightfully icky as Switchblade Sam - he looks like he's bathed in oil slick and then raided a mental patient's wardrobe.
I saw this movie in seventh grade on a free day in school, when I heard that we were watching it, I had heard that it did not do to well, but then I decided to just watch it.
And then we did, I recalled that I was laughing so hard, no sound came out!
And then there is Christopher Lloyd in one of his best performances ever.
Secondly, the introduction of Switchblad Sam was a typical (and oh so tired) Hughes device, although it was surprisingly violent compared to his other films (watching a cute little five year old force feed and then accidentally set a villain on fire was slightly disturbing, to say the least).
Hildegard is a schoolteacher, who takes her class (a remarkably mixed racial class for 1932) on a field trip to the New York Acquarium, then in lower Manhattan in what is still Castle Clinton National Monument (it was also, in the 1850s, Castle Gardens, where Jenny Lind sang to the public).
Connoisseurs of period mystery should especially treasure THE PENGUIN POOL MURDER for its location shots of some now vanished (or at least radically transformed) Manhattan landmarks - most notably the then New York City Aquarium (long before the institution decamped to Brooklyn).
My pride in this is not just the fact that it features me and my then fledgling (one month old) Church of Satanic Liberation.
I would have watched then, but the cover was misleading.
A spoiled feline who pushes his butler, Meadows, too far and then finds himself with no-one to look after him, Pussy makes the most of his short time in the spotlight (he was usurped by the similarly jittery Claude Cat) by having one of the all time great mental collapses in cartoon history.
I saw it on TV about two years ago, but since then it hasn't been on and is fairly vague in my mind.
Then comes the standard cops do not believe a thing scene that usually appear in movies of this sort and then a rather interesting dream sequence.
I saw this film a few years ago and since then I have been trying too find a worse film.
Neon Maniacs,great movie by far one of my top 5 greatest films.The movie is so great because of the great original plot and characters...have u ever seen a movie when maniacs are killed by...water?No then check this out.I love alot of movies this definetly is one of them and its also hard to get so if u ever find it get it because even if u didnt like it its one of those movies when u cant not see it and u have to judge yourself!
And then the movie's abrupt ending in the rain with the comment "This rain can't last forever".
The monsters are then set out to hunt down the teen survivor and not letting anything get in their way.
Back then I thought it sucked, but a couple a months ago I was strolling through my video store when I decided to give it another try.
Vicky says yes, Sapna is confused, Prem adds to the confusion confounded until...And then how the sacrificial jigsaw puzzle is abruptly solved, forms the substance of this 'savior de f aire '.
Max and Dave Fleischer went on to make numerous famous Betty Boop and Popeye cartoons, and then Dave got into directing the early Superman animated shorts.
My father wondered if it really was a movie in his taste... and then the movie started.
And if you aren't a fan of this type of comedy, then why are you reading this anyways?
If you don't like obnoxious and dumb humor, then this isn't the movie for you.
But, if you love dumb humor, are a big fan of slapstick comedies, want to laugh your butt off, or if you just like Jim Carrey's movies, then this is for you.
Once Lloyd finds the love of his life, he obsesses over her and even gets involved further in her life then he should have.
Jeff Daniels does and equally good job as Harry who is less dumb then Lloyd but still gets into plenty of trouble.
There's the woman in particular, acted very well (she's the one sprawled out on a couch or other, with black hair, at least I *think* it's her), who responds to the Jodorowsky character at first with disdain, but then noticing his body changes her attitude.
Our tale begins when Lloyd (Jim Carrey) is escorting a young woman named Mary Swanson (the gorgeous Lauren Holly, who Carrey eventually married and then divorced) to an airport.
), at first hesitates, and then reluctantly agrees, and so they are off.
Well, then.
The film then disappeared in an attic for almost half a century, until it was rediscovered in 2006.
Mother claims not to be a pianist but she is giving a lesson to already then well fledged pianist.
....but then you got to explain to other people why ?
He was no ordinary fellow , but then again Nicola Tesla was a genius as well and who knows how his childhood was like ?
If he was cast just for his musical talent, then the director of the movie got lucky, because man can he act!
Vitus' solutions to his various problems involve the stock market, his doting grandfather's trust, daddy's hearing aides, an airplane, losing his gift and then wrapping the whole thing up with a grand concert (Schumann).
If you have ever attempted to excel in any area and encounter a person who is so above and beyond what is normally considered excellence, then your appreciation for such a person is heightened.
Vitus is played by Fabrizio Bursoni as a delightful precocious 6 year old then by TEO GHEORGHIU when he is 12.
The baby is fine for less than a week when she begins to cry constantly, which brings Abby back to the shaky state she was in during Joshua's early stages--and then some.
The problem is Vitus doesn't fit in in school and then his mom takes him from his childhood piano teacher, who he says he loves, to a famous lady who declares "a rational mind and a warm heart, those are what make a great pianist."
And, then, there is the piano performance of a real musical savant.
Screenwriters could learn a lot by analyzing the elements that composed this film and then writing more good ones like this.
There is always one cop, one lady and few bad guys that are looking more funny too me, then dangerous (Michael Lerner and Kristopher Logan).
Sadly it does not last long as the movie apparently ran out of budget after that scene was shot and everything went down hill from then on.
Here, the mortally wounded tank simply stops, groans for a moment, then whines as it slides slowly back down the berm and halts.
Interplay between the main character & his employer/benefactor and then with the other members of the sect is presented in a great way.
For some reason, "Das Boot," which had more drama in any given two minutes of its running time than "Volver a empezar" in its entirety, couldn't be nominated and then selected.
Since then I have been hunting for it high and low here and in Canada so that I could see it from beginning to end, without interruption...
He then invites her to his house in Arkham.
Cities bombed to ruins, then fought over to the last man.
As Lovecraft knew a person's imagination is capable of creating something much more terrifying then anything that could be created by someone else.
Stockwell comes across as kind of a space cadet but then again he's allegedly only part human so that may be forgivable.
Maybe not even then.
I was but 10 and just happened to get drawn into this movie about a young Russian soldier trying to get home to see his mom, going through all kinds of foibles and silliness traveling and government red tape presents to him, in the meantime falling in love with a beautiful, kind fellow traveler, and then finally getting to spend a few very brief moments with his mom, with a flock of cackling neighbors standing a short distance away.
I wish the good parts of the actual film could be put with some scenes and sequences that are as moving and intriguing as the title sequence - then they would have a really memorable film!
The intro (beginning credits) was a scary cartoon done in shadow.In the cartoon you see a woman giving birth to a baby to be quickly taken away by the "devil" who then eats the baby!
In general, the film is a delicate, lyrical story about a young Soviet soldier who goes off to fight the Germans, and then gets just enough leave time to come back to his small village and see his mother.
I normally don't watch season premiers but then end up loving the show.
He then tries to solve the case all by himself, and the police follow him around.
it is a good watch nevertheless, and will not disappoint you if you can "pass" the explosion scene without loosing any interest... so the plot gets 10 stars( while i will ignore the similarities, they are different in context itself and do make perfect sense overall ), the acting gets 10 as well( i can not think of anyone that was playing "badly"), the soundtrack gets an 8 ( great musical choices but not consistent, again a sign of low budget),the camera work gets a 10( great achievement for a low budget), the script gets a 5( 1 for originality in essence and 10 for consistency), and finally the cgi effects get a more then deserved 1 star.
Ray Liotta plays a district attourney running for mayor when his DA is raped by a supposed psychotic music store clerk and then murders him.
The alleged attacker (Mekhi Phifer) was a man she supposedly met one night in a record store and who then proceeded to stalk her for weeks thereafter.
The initial thrill, at least for the audience, in these two coming together is part-cruelly, part-wonderfully interrupted by the train's large, wooden door being torn open by a guard on the outside who then engages in talk with Alyosha, before he himself is able to renew acquaintances with Shura.
I found it un-involving, and when you don't care about the characters, then you don't care who's innocent or guilty and the film loses all effectiveness.
No, this film is not for everyone, but if you can remember what it was like to be genuinely stringed along and interested in what happens at every twist and turn of those 90's film plots, then you should find yourself feeling that you got you're 9.50's worth on a Friday night.
Two different sides then vie for possession of the tube, the first comprised of an archaeologist, a shot-first-and-never-ask-questions cop (Savini, the only "actor" of note in this film), and a "mysterious" (read: boring) vigilante who may or may not be an alien.
It's then that Gen. Helmut makes a secret deal with US Army Major Tom Neeley, Robin Clark,to trade the documents for his safety out of the country and possible being tried as a Nazi war criminal.
There's also in the movie the husky voiced and very athletic looking Marthe Keller as Lisa Spangler in a role that she seemed to play in every film she was in back then; The mystery woman.
Come to think of it I think I would have rather seen a movie based on the internal battles of the studio/writer and the director then this mess.
Yet, I wonder if those who did not enjoy this movie as I did might not find it more interesting if viewed today with gas heading toward $4 and then maybe $5 a gallon?
If anyone knows then feel free to email me.
Lorne Greene as Adama is the archetype of the wise leader, and the girls might seem very 70s to us today, but they certainly worked back then :-)  All in all, I think that Battlestar Galactica, at least the movie, deserves some better praise than that you usually hear.
If one is to talk of genres in Russian film, then the World War II film is a genre all to itself.
If like me you are unsure of whether you saw Star Wars or this first, then a mutual fondness of both arises.
And then we have Starbuck, probably the most memorable character from the entire series.
These guys were probably one of the biggest money makers of the series back then.
The stir was caused by the apparent nudity of the then 13-year old star, Brooke Shields.
This may be strange today, but back then, it may, repeat may, have been common.
As beautiful as Pretty Baby is to look at, seeing the twitching faces of the men during the auction of Violet and then their nonchalance and camaraderie in partaking in it made me shudder.
And to you Christians,don't forget that Mary was 13 or 14 when Christ was born,she also was betrothed to Joseph at age 12, which was the custom then.
The deflowering ritual that Violet had to undergo would have scared me senseless, and it is pitifully sad to think that she looked forward to it, only because then the other women in the house would really take her seriously.
But then comes the problem of morals- Sarandon isn't the one who falls for Carradine, but Shields really.
The one thing it has going for it is historical interest - it is a great snapshot of New Orleans in this era, touching on the US navy and its role in supporting, then ultimately wrecking, "red light" culture, as well as music, race relations, poverty and prostitution.
If he doesn't give us the social structure and eidos of a French boarding school, then it's Atlantic City, or a New Orleans whorehouse in 1917.
The photographer (Keith Carradine) eventually allows Violet to move in with him, and then marries her.
She is thrilled, but then asks why he bought her a doll.
The women portraying the "girls" in the movie could have been working girls in "The District" had they lived back then.
Some IMDb readers profess to be shocked by conditions in Storyville back then, but as the book recounts, it was all true, and many of the women actually did enjoy their livelyhood.
It's a wonderful irony, because the director opens with such a powerful & nihilistic statement, but then he follows with a sweet and inspiring presentation which you might even call "innocent".
I first watch the intro (which was cool) then I watch an episode or two.
All these movies are better then Tiger Claw 3.
Remi and Marion, then, are not so much connected by their sexual bond, but by the fact that they've both been abandoned by the people they love.
Now-a-days it wouldn't seem so great, but back then it was phenomenal, especially for die-hard Wing Commander (WC) fans.
But then I played this and oooooh boy was it good.
").I like him in this role better then as Luke Skywalker from Star Wars(I know I surprised myself).
Amongst all the laughs there were touching,"real" moments of life like retirement or "The Lou and Edie Story" when Lou's wife Edie leaves him or "Chuckles Bites The Dust",the best known episode of TMTMS when the station's clown,Chuckles,dies in a bizarre elephant crushing,Mary is disgusted at the sick jokes until she gets the giggles at the funeral,then there is a debate about people's reactions to death,all very deep indeed.
In other episodes we also see Alex so romantic in love with Elen and later hurt because she leaves him for dancing scholarship to France and then he falls in love with Lauren (Courtney Cox).
What I also find amazing is that they manage to pack a satisfying story in the fairly short format of less then 30 minutes.
So watch the movie just to get it over with, then sit back and enjoy Muller's critique.
The mystery holds for a while, then this viewer became a bit tired of scene after scene of talky explanations, and not much cinematic action.
No one could say Mank didn't have a checkered career: In the 1930s he was castigated for daring to re-write Scott Fitzgerald (in his capacity as Producer on Three Comrades, Scott's only solo writing credit, he felt obliged to 'tidy' up several sequences) and in the 1960s he was the guy brought in to re-write and 'salvage' Cleopatra but in between he initially wrote then wrote and directed some very tasty fare indeed culminating in his two magnum opii A Letter To Three Wives And All About Eve.
Fox then dropped her.
She played the main feminine role in Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951) and was then third-billed (Mark Stevens and Rhonda Fleming were the stars featured on all the posters) in Little Egypt (1951).
While watching this one, I kept thinking what a great vehicle it would have been for John Ireland...then I checked the IMDB and found that Ireland did the voice-over narration.......Freudian??
The storyline's almost as complicated as The Big Sleep's, and as murky, but then clockwork plots never sat well in film noir Â the universe it dwells in stays random, volatile, unfathomable.
And Highmore, who first came to prominence in "Finding Neverland" and then starred as the lead in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," is one of the most gifted child actors around.
After watching the film I think that the only way this could have influenced Tarantino is if he watched it and then said "this is terrible, I bet I can do this a million times better" and then did it a million times better.
3 men and a woman murder a young woman's husband an then take her and torture and rape her for three days.
She then sets out to kill the rest of the gang but is arrested and sent to prison.
So not for the faint hearted then!
So it does have many emotions that it touches ... A good B-Movie then!
If you still have an inner child, and an imagination that has not been beaten out of you by the "practical and mature" world, then you will love this movie.
If not, then the most you'll probably give it is an 'ok'.
If it wasn't for almost every other show on the Comedy Network then this show would be the worst all time, but since they have made even worse shows than this it is saved from the title of "all time worst".
Anybody thinking of watching this show, you might as well take a fork and jab yourself in the eye, that would be a lot more entertaining then watching this dreg.
1) and then see a work that inspired Kill Bill, like Shurayukihime, feel let down some how that they didn't see the same exact film twice.
Once again, I say, please study the history first, then view the series.
Moll then marries a ship's captain, who takes her to his prosperous Virginia plantation.
If you liked Kill Bill for other reasons than that it had Uma Thurman and Lucy Liu in it, then you will love this film.
All in all my words cannot really do it justice, if you get the opportunity to see it then please do.
Michael Dudikoff is one of those "actors" in Hollywood that makes his living on B grade action movies that don't have any story or fun what so ever.The same goes for "Crash Dive", a totally inert flick that borrows heavily from "Under Siege","Die Hard" and so forth.The acting is horrible as is the story.Come on,a middle east terrorist group (that contains Russian speaking Germans WAAHAA) that invades a sub marine and then wants to destroy New York or Washington to rule the world.The same old story told without any humor.I'm starting to feel a little sea sick now...  At one point I was cheering for the terrorists,I mean who would put nukes on a sub.Then you're begging for total destruction.Dudikoff is no action hero and he wouldn't be a good terrorist either,he's below that.
And then that ugly "Russian" woman,she looks awful,why couldn't she die earlier?
If you thought that 'Little Red Riding Rabbit (1944)' was an offbeat adaptation of the fairy-tale, then you haven't seen nothing yet.
When Red first appears on stage, tossing aside her outfit to reveal a decidedly immodest red costume, I was genuinely taken aback, and then felt somewhat ashamed of myself.
He then chases her to "Grandma's house" (which is really a giant apartment), Grandma sees the Wolf and starts chasing him!
Lady Snowblood is much darker then any of the Lone Wolf films just in the fact that much of the action happens at night or in shadowy places.
While the martial prowess is not so good in this film it is more then made up for by the haunted look on the actress' face and startling dismemberment.
It worked then, it works now and will work tomorrow, precisely because Avery had that most overworked and little understood word-genius.
Since then, I've gone on to check out more of the Japanese 'Pinky' genre and I can now say, without doubt, that Lady Snowblood belongs on the absolute top of the pile!
After the death of her mother, the daughter then goes into heavy training where she learns to fight and use a Samurai sword.
My only "suggestion" would have been to throw in some gratuitous sex and nudity that is more typical of the pinky films, and then LADY SNOWBLOOD would have been damn-near perfect.
If you like period pieces, good acting, or a great love story then this is a must see!
Andrew Davies' script brings every last scene from the book and then pops in some new, being as absolutely faithful to the book as anyone could hope to be.
If you enjoy immersing yourself into the time of Jane Austen for an afternoon, and enjoy the simplicity of way back when, then you would really enjoy this movie.
And then comes that moment.
But then, this could never have been a popular film.
I am not ashamed to admit I got interested in it after it being linked to Kill Bill, but then again, I hadn't heard of it until a while after the Kill Bill movies came out, and I thought it sounded like something I'd be interested in, my kind of movie.
He only made a few films, won a slew of awards for this one, and then nada!
If Gibson Frazier does not become a star, then something is wrong.
It really shows the difference of then and now.
The Marx Brothers ending (no spoiler really), and the short Egyptian tomb sequence show the care that was taken with getting all the 1920's aspects down perfectly (and don't forget the musical numbers, when people would break into song in any sort of film back then -well, the talkies at least).
If you want to understand the news as both sides see it, then I highly recommend it.
It gets old quick sometimes though, as there's Sean and Alan and then the respective conservative and liberal guests all going off at once yelling at each other like a bunch of third graders.
I don't know, then again maybe I'm just thinking about this too much.
If you like cheesy creature features then Supergator isn't all that bad but it's nothing new or special.
I've definitely seen better but then again I've definitely seen worse.
She then runs into a geeky guy, and they try to hide together.
I don't want to sound smug, but I'm probably one of the few people my age who can say that, and seeing 'Lady Snowblood' before 'Kill Bill' is a lot better than seeing 'Kill Bill' and then expecting 'Lady Snowblood' to be exactly like 'Kill Bill'.
Those who haven't seen 'Kill Bill' should see this first, and then 'Kill Bill' after.
If one mocks creature-features for all of the above, then they all get a 1/10 rating - which ignores the fact that some are far more enjoyable than others.
I then decided to have a second look a couple of years ago to see whether my initial reaction was correct and, if anything, I was too kind to it.
King has a particularly regrettable scene with sexy dominatrix Phyllis Davis and then kills himself!
I like this movie -- and if you like Dirty Harry and think he is AWESOME for KICKING ASS, if you think this world has gotten WAY TO PC for comfort, if you like to party and make no excuses for it -- then you will like this movie, too!
These yo-yo's end up causing more trouble to the community as well as themselves then any gang of street thugs could possibly do and were supposed to like them?
We get a bunch of stories of cops who are so unstable and unprofessional that they come across worse then any of the criminals in the movie and end up getting the worse of it when their ever called upon to arrest or restrain them.
That was supposed to be the high point in the movie that would make you forget just how silly and hare-brained it was up until then.
Of course, if you don't like anyone saying politically incorrect things (even if that person is presented as a total moron) then you might be too "delicate" to appreciate the humor.
Quite how then he created such an incredibly offensive movie then is a matter to ponder over and only worth considering because of the director's fame.
Definitely not for the weak hearted and if your a fan of the series well then i suggest you get a copy of this fast because it was very hard to get mine believe me.
If the first movie went with the first game's plot then I hope that he uses the plot involving the grown up Alessa from this game for the next movie.
-if you like games that draw you in and if you saw the masterpiece of enjoyable cinema that was the movie "Silent Hill" and want an idea of what will happen in the sequel then pick this game up, but if disturbing images and odd looking demons aren't your thing then it's best to stick to "Barbie's Horse Adventure"   I miss you Pyramid Head
This one has a good story of a girl who while at the mall starts to see weird things, then of course monsters show up and our gal named Heather must navigate the demented mall, which gets even more demented after a ride in an elevator.
This has amazing music, if there may be more lyrics than earlier in the series; then again, they are fantastic, and like the second, this does, as it needs to, distinguish itself(without deviating so much that we get alienated), they can't all be carbon-copies, they have to do something new.
The story-telling is well-done(I swear to you, I was literally touched a handful of times during this, not only scared) with you finding details as you go along, and then the scripted, in-engine cut-scenes(there are no CGI ones in this one, and they are not missed), with a free cinematography(with that said, were there an excess of shots from below the protagonist, or was that just me?
The film concerns two hunters, who find and then are terrorized by, an evil entity.
To its credit, it shows promise from the 20- to the 45-minute mark, but then just falls into an incoherent mess.
We then get a story moving into total fantasy as the bones and skull of what looked like a rhinoceros come to life and start leaving parts of bodies all over the town.Naturally the police don't believe the theory that the remains of the bodies have been killed by a creature who chewed them to death!.
The ending was really dumb, and it seemed the movie was partially written, shot, then written more, shot etc.
When the time comes, the dog pig pushes her down (while she's smiling), and then rips an arm off of her.
But then again, if your willing to pay $35 on Amazon.com for this DVD, then something's wrong with you (I bought it for $9 used and regretted it).
This is the third decade since then and life moves on.
But where it really counts - as a human drama filled with complex and fully realized individuals who make a mark on our hearts - the film delivers the goods and then some.
On the beginning you have a man with great enthusiasm, then he gets more serious because of his job and his middle ages, an then later...
You'd say, why don't you give this movie 10 out of 10 then?
I then bought the DVD, which is something I rarely do.
It was one of those nights when I wanted to watch something light for half an hour and then go to bed.
Whether or not director Giordana and his writers intended the nearly dead center division, Part One ticks, and then Part Two tocks.
If this is more than just a really, really good soap opera, then there have to be ambiguity, loose ends, disappointments that come more from life's constraints than from audiences' need for reassurance and resolution.
If he's hurting over Matteo, then he's selfish.
If he's just being professional, then we're denied his rationale.
Whatever was wrong with him likely was already wrong then.
Humorous and deeply touching moments perfectly counterbalance one another in a setting that flits from Rome to Norway to Florence (during the 1966 flood) to Turin (during the student demonstrations of the late 60s and 70s), then to Milan, Sicily and the Tuscan countryside in the present day.
If the film had just told the story of General Dallaire and his failed peacekeeping mission and then focused on how Rwanda has changed in the decade since the horrific genocide, it would have been a very good documentary.
It seems that all you can do is try to contain it and then pick up the pieces once it's over.
By then 800,000 people were dead.
The movie starts a bit slowly, then it gets a bit of a more interesting pace, but overall it's not a movie that will have you see it again any time soon.
You know right off the bat that she fancies him, yet they are to some degree enemies throughout the middle, then she suddenly cares about him again and helps him, and then they are passionately in love by the end.
Yet then Billy Crudup's character comes in to talk to him all distraught about his inability to act as a man.
I actually laughed at a couple of these instances and thought it would be comic relief for the movie, but then these laughable instances suddenly stopped and again it seemed like the writer/director were taking a more serious turn with the movie.
I wasn't interested in the film, but then my sister got the DVD for her birthday.
Then the chain of events unfold as Maria is introduced to Charles II (Rupert Everett) and his mistress Nell Gwyn (Zoe Tapper) who then declares that women will be given the freedom to perform in theater.
But then again Maria is unable to play the role of Desdemona as a real woman.
Mistress Hughes is charming and true, Ned is perfect, I could well understand _Mariah_'s affection, and I did love his hands; Charlie is great (but then, Everett is always great), pretty witty Nell is a bundle of energy...
If you can live with that, showing a success on stage that we can believe, even if it couldn't "actually have happened" ... then you'll enjoy this story.
Since then, I have seen it three more times, and have concluded that even though it does not have a technically typical or logical resolution and plot, it is so rife with talented performances, excellent directing and powerful messages that the seemingly empty conclusion must be overlooked.
If you are coming from an angle in which no Kinsey scale exists, then the offense makes sense.
At first amused, then devastated by a loss of roles, income and prestige, Ned slides to singing bawdy songs in drag to a somewhat low(er) class clientele in a sink run by a foulmouthed harridan.
Buckingham was, in actuality, one of the most complex characters during Charles's two decade exile and then restoration to the throne.
And Tom Wilkinson as Ned's and then Maria's stage impresario combines business acumen with a soft human touch.
The school of acting in that era was an artificial one where actors relied in gestures and affectations that would be laughable today in a serious drama, but that was the way it was the accepted Method then, nothing to do with Stanivslaski, or Strassberg.
He has sex for the first time, impregnates her, and then it completely makes sense that when her son's illness comes back, Alexai's healing powers are gone.
If your jaw doesn't drop when the girls go the bathroom, then you must be a psychic.
The story then revolves around these people and the pain of expectations and misunderstandings that separate them.  
But then the end of the movie comes suddenly, with time having passed, Julie growing large with Alexei's baby, and everyone seeming to be at peace with life at that point.
The movie follows one story line, then decides to change to just random events for the last 50 minutes.
If you liked Star Wars, He Man and the Masters of the Universe or Queens Flash Gordon soundtrack then catch this movie on cable because they ripped them all off and did a very bad job of it.
Half way through this film, I thought that the directors might as well have made a porn film with this material--then I would have given this movie some credit!
However he then realises that he can't get back across the immense gap which prompts his friend Pag to perform one hell of a circus stunt in order to save the day!
If you have seen an Austrian movie called "Funny Games" then you can see where this film likely got its influence from.
If you have seen anything by Miike Takishi before then this is quite tame in comparison to much of his other work (if you haven't then don't ask as you'll either love it or hate it and it's a conversation for another day).
This post-war, pre-Elvis time period is one that I find interesting and this film sheds some light on life in America then.
Something a bit different then just having your average day killer going around killing teenagers, though I don't mind a dose of that every now and again.
This story is visually stunning, but then again, it appears that this was a pre-requisite to make this film since all three short stories are equally good looking.
It united some truly amazing talent and the result is nothing less then one of the best horror films of the decade.
If you are searching for something artistic, horrifying and with something to say, then by all means indulge yourself in "Three Extremes" a fine example of how Japanese Horror is kicking American Horror firmly in its ass.
We then learn this isn't what it appears to be and so goes the actual story.
Mrs. Li is very pleased with the results at first, but then gets sick after finishing a 'meal' made of the leftovers of an incest baby.
I do recommend this film to fans of horror or Asian cinema, if not then try something new, this films a good catch and worth watching.
The traffic problems then are no different today and should be used as clear examples for today's young driver students.
The message it puts out is just as true now as it was then.
Of course if you watch "Dumplings" and you haven't got a strong resolve then you may not make it to the other two films.
If you like more artistic, intelligent, and subtle horror films, then these shorts are for you.
Here's a short review...  Box-Takashi Miike (Japanese Language) This is a nightmarish tale of a woman's horrifying dreams becoming reality, but then again, maybe not.
This appears to happen at the apartment of Aunt Mei, and then it shows her packing up and leaving.
The second disc which contains a text portion which explains the plot of each story, and then a "Making Of" extra for all three stories is very good.
Since I'm watching so many Asian movies recently, I find the languages of the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese to be so different, but then again similar.
The only answer is for sure the political will to defeat them, but the right strategy is not to shoot first but to corner them at all levels and then shoot them down if they don't want to come down all by themselves.
Maxwell will then ask for 5 million dollars with a promised from the state and city of safe passage out of the country.
These gutless political hacks are more interested in their jobs photo-ops and promotions then in the safety of the people of San Francisco.
Best Dirty Harry film until then.
Harry has one problem, he's given a new partner and it's non other then a lady inspector.
Obviously back then it was more interesting to make a spoof, since there already was an over-production of regular teen slashers, but efficient comedy and genuine horror are two incredibly difficult ingredients to mix into one scenario.
Director James Fargo then shot some extra pickup footage, extra coverage, then edited the whole thing together.
We took them all for granted back then.
It starts with really horrible filming where I cannot see a thing and then she puts a plant on the table.
He barely touches her at all and then says the iron isn't hot.
Best Dirty Harry film until then.
The only problem is that now the plot seems a lot tamer than it was then.
It is 1) unrealistic that Irene Dunn, missing at sea for seven years, should reappear on the very day that husband, Cary Grant, has succeeded in having her declared dead and then, moments later, remarried in the same courtroom and 2) that Grant's mother would not have attended the wedding; presumably the writers needed Dunne's mother-in-law to be in when Dunne (who naturally would not have known about the new wedding so would have no reason to attend and try to stop it) resurfaced though a little thought could have solved this.
Movie moves into high gear when Nick (Cary Grant) sees his first wife as the elevator door closes in the hotel on the way to the honeymoon suite with his bride and he's on the spot to break it to his new bride but then finds out his wife was stranded with a hunk of an anthropologist (Randalf Scott).
The plot is not confusing, not less then Pulp Fiction's structure might be!
And then there's the scene of Grant looking through women's clothing, holding them up to a mirror, while telling a doctor, "I have to go, he's waiting for me in the car!"
Grant starts to feel a little less guilty then.
If you really love Abbott and Costello, then you will probably really want to see this movie, because you might like it, but if you are not a fan of the Perfect Straight Man and the Perfect Buffoon, then you will probably not like this movie, but I like Abbott and Costello, and so I did like this movie!
The killer steals the Nixon mask a man scares his wife with, and then gets murdered by a killer.
If you're a fan of Abbott and Costello routines, then "The Noose Hangs High" is for you.
He started this around 1967 and when the Cabaret finally was forced to close its doors (as many "supper theaters" did) in 1989, many of those children, then in their late teens or early twenties, came to the mike and said it had given them the confidence to get into shows.
Andrew then meets two men who force people into a dark and depraved world.
If Hollywood violence and sexy performances are what you're after then possibly this film isn't for you.
If your expecting Tarantino Esq dialogue and charisma then yes you'll be disappointed, but Evans has clearly not set out to make that sort of film and I thought he got an excellent performance out of Bool.
In doing so, Andrew is discovered by a gang of snuff filmmakers, who organise and carry out real-life beatings, murders, sex and drugs, which they then capture on DV camera, and he begins his journey into the filthy underworld of criminal society - and into more danger than he could possibly ever have imagined.
But if the violence is primarily what people talk about after seeing the film then that would be a real crime because the film is packed full of wonderful moments of real human emotion.
Cut to many scenes with the other girl, then nighttime.
At first, you will hate it, then you will like it for how cheesy it is.
But when you consider the fact that the forerunner is up against such twisted beasts as Blood Harvest, Don't Open 'til Christmas, Pieces, Bloodbeat and the almost extra terrestrial A Day of Judgement, then you begin to realise how tough a challenge it really is.
When it comes to leaving you dumbfounded and gasping at the screen - jaw dropped quicker than if you just received a shattering right hook from Mike Tyson Â then Horror House on Highway Five has crossed the finish line while the others are still tying up their shoe-laces.
If you were hallucinating consistently, then you'd expect to see that kind of thing, surely?
They then head for the road and pick up a strange hitchiker, Baby (Sheri Moon).
Their car then breaks down and Baby takes them to her house, not far up the road.
They then are pulled into a world of torture and violence, as they are captured by a family of insane lunatics who want them dead.
If you like horror films then you will love this movie.
The film also contains a rather clever plot misdirection about mid way through, a subplot about cops and one of the victim's father that makes you think the plot is going to evolve one way, but then completely changes direction you.
A movie that was made for approximately $140,000, that still manages to be way more effective then House.
As the R rated version stands it fails as a gross out flick and then later goes on to fail even completely at the loftier goal of actually being scary.
then you probably arent meant to be seeing this film.
If you are a true James Bond fan then this is a must see movie for you, if not then don't waste your time.
The whole thing takes a long time to develop & then falls apart in semi-bathetic babbling.
I honestly believe that if you cannot relate to her character here, then you are a soul-less creature and definitely have forgotten the tragedies of 9-11-2001.
Lenny leaves, the mother lovingly puts her son to bed, then she goes out to a bar where she encounters none other than Jasper trying to tempt her to his lair.
The whole story looks like repetition, and then the mystery to be revealed of how everything happened is very badly done, it is easily guessed, not in any way clever, and pointless.
If you are now thinking that a film about the aftermath of a major terroristÂ attackÂ from the director ofÂ Brigit Jones' Diary sounds like a recipe for disaster, then you are partly right.
She predictably bonds with the son out of nowhere (I literally leaned over and said "She's going to buy him a cricket bat" to a friend after the boy mentioned his dad was supposed to buy him one for his birthday...and lo and behold, she did) and then suddenly there's a standoff at the train station where she gets apparently shot in the head and has not a scratch to show for it.
If you are old enough to remember Ida Lupino and Dane Clark when they were both at the top of their careers in the 1940's, then this film will be a great Classic to view and enjoy.
Dane Clark is very good too, even if he never got past second fiddle to John Garfield-- then too, his strictly blue-collar personality was a poor fit for the upwardly mobile 1950's, and by that white-collar decade, he was gone.
If this isn't your cup of tea then WHY do you watch it AND feel necessary to rate it poorly ?
This time it's not an outer-space visitor, but a mutant of genetic work which goes through transformation cycles and then making ends meat of a terrific b-cast.
All three were released in the US by Roger Corman's New World Films and make a sort of unofficial Trio -- The first was Norman "Warm & Fuzzy" Warren's deceptively cheesy looking HORROR PLANET (or INSEMINOID) in 1980, then Bob Clark's GALAXY OF TERROR (or MIND WARP: AN INFINITY OF TERROR) in 1981, then Holzman's FORBIDDEN WORLD in 1982.
All three had very low production budgets but stand as remarkable & effective little shockers with allegorical references to alien outsiders who want to kill our men and mate with our women, and then eat them.
One of the interesting aspects of the film is how it repeatedly disrobes it's women and then places them in harm's way, with this grinning, drooling, slimy alien just a tentacle slither away, and as with GALAXY OF TERROR much of what we now know as Hentai Anime and it's unsavory sexual violence was given root in what we see in these films: Slimy, tubular, disgusting aliens having their way with or just simply ripping apart aggressively gorgeous, sexy women in states of undress or nudity.
You see, she believes that the Angel of Death is stalking her and if she never lets anyone inside, then she'll live forever.
Soon after a guy named Jonas (Victor Melleney) is attacked by a bat in a mine which he kills, he then notices a strange blue crystal which shoots a blue laser-beam at the bat which returns to life.
Jonas tells Lucas who decides to use the crystal to bring his daughter back to life who then lures unsuspecting travellers to Hellgate for reasons I don't really know so Lucas can kill them for reasons that are never satisfactorily explained.
Although this was made in 1933 (or at least released then) it totally made me think of the German Expressionist movement of the 1920s.
(The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari sprang to mind) You definitely need to already know the story of Sodom & Gomorrah, but as another reviewer stated, the audience back then would have been well-versed in biblical text.
A black person having his or her own TV show was shocking back then.
And even then, it pulled me toward where I am now.
I love the old style of acting they had back then.
We are then taken back to the 1800's where Arthur Conan Doyle(Robin Laing)is a medical student at Edingborough Univeristy.He signs up for a class taken by the esteemed surgeon Dr.Joseph Bell(Ian Richardson)who has remarkable powers of deduction which astound those he teaches.
They involve a nobleman who often visits a house of ill repute and whose wife becomes ill; a mute street beggar who plays the violin for coins, and who dies in convulsions; a room bespattered and filled with blood, and then slaughtered sheep are discovered with their eyes gouged out; a woman who dies in a locked room with a husband who is perhaps too helpful; a pair of severed human ears placed in a box and delivered to one of the few women who are studying, with great opposition from most of the teachers and many of the male students, to be doctors; a woman of the streets who was given herbal pills and now is vomiting her life out.
"I loose my mind at all, and then I fall in love."
Biberman first casts his wife in the lead role, then replaces her with Mexican actress Rosaura Revueltas (Angela Molina).
"salt of the Earth" showed the American people how the mass hysteria of the late 1940's and 50's Communist witch hunts did far more damage to the American way of life and US Consitution then what all the subversive activities of all the Soviet agents in the US combined could have done.
Every scene and every line in this film is perfect, and if it is a "period piece," then I say we'd be so much better off if we could return to that "period."
Convicted thief and murderer Joe Brezzi (Joe Dallesandro) escapes from prison, murders a man with a pitchfork, steals his car and then heads off to find 300 million lira he'd stolen and hid in a secluded vacation home right before he was arrested.
When Paola comes to, she's "raped" (well, it starts as a rape...) and then her sister and brother-in-law show up for more of the same.
Maybe then, fans could see the beauty of some true German madness!!
:o) If you don't know the story, well it's simple, it's about this cannibalistic loner who preys on a group of young people who come investigating in his area, one by one he kills off the group in a manner of revolting ways........ some of the gore is cheap looking but some is a lot more realistic, just some of the examples of the gore are: axe in the face, guts being pulled out of peoples throats, baby being pulled out of a pregnant woman's stomach, and then chewing on the baby's head, gruesome stuff!!!
If you're planning on renting a trashy Friday night flick, then go for something else.
For instance, he bashes someones face in (literally) with a rock and then disembowels him.
It is the type of ending that has you literally hiding behind a cushion one minute, then jumping up and cheering the next.
If you liked lady vengeance or dark water, this is a film for you, if you like good cinema that makes you think then again this is a good movie for you.
The opening scene features a naked blonde in a shower for no reason other than show off her breasts, she is chased by Grubeck & then just lies there & waits for him to kill her which he does by pulling a rope which releases a fake stalactite to impale her!
He spouts some nonsense about love and then abruptly splits the brides head open like a watermelon.
The other cast members too were downright splendid Dermot Walsh as Knox's fellow doctor/friend, Renee Houston as Burke's wife, John Cairney as one of Knox's medical students Chris Jackson and then you another equally good performance by Billie Whitelaw as the strong-minded Mary Patterson.
Soon they find it is even easier to just kill then dig up bodies(in fact they do not dig up ONE body in this film).
But then no one's performance is so bad that it's outstanding.
Unfortunately, the liner notes by Jonathan Sothcott were not available with my copy: it's probable that the disc was initially released as a snapper-case (with the essay on the inner sleeve) but was then dropped when re-issued in the more manageable keep-case!
I reckon that writer/director John Gilling then added some fictional elements to his film, like the characterizations of the main roles, since Hare's persona is almost blackly comical and Dr. Knox' attitude is stubborn and typically obnoxious like nearly every scientist in horror cinema.
If you don't reform, then prepare to be Terminated!
then you'll surely enjoy this one.
".But she has good reason for butchering six people: they all commited a crime that no one understands, like dumping her daughter, eating poultry (because Beverly loves birds),smart-alacing about her dentist husband, refusing to rewind a rental tape, critisizing about her family skills, and witnessing one of the other five crimes.You may think she's insane, but really, she's just expressing things we'd rather hide inside of us.Like, say you work in a store and someone wants to return something but they don't have the recipt.It can't be returned without the recipt, so you tell them "No can do".Then they start cursing you out like you're worthless.Wouldn't you get the urge to shove a bullet in their brain?Well then, you now know how Beverly Sutphin feels when someone decides to be a wise guy.This movie is perfect for anyone who loves to laugh.Plus, the DVD contains the theatrical trailer, a behind-the-scenes featurette, several TV spots, four interview clips, and extra behind the scenes footage.I give this one a 10/10!
If another director, say Robert Zemeckis or someone had directed this, then based on the subject matter, I probably wouldn't have had any interest in seeing it.
If you're a Waters devotee, then you are well aware that criminal behavior, trials, and serial killers are subjects near and dear to his heart-this is a man who is a self-confessed "trial groupie".
If you like Waters' latest irreverent venture into visceral, cutting black humour, then get all his other movies, because they are all even more extreme and grotesque - "Pink Flamingos", "Hairspray", "Cry Baby" - all kitschy, underrated classics in their own right.
One of her killings involves dropping the stage lights at a concert on the head of her son's friend and then proceeding to set him on fire while the audience applauds her sadism, but Waters doesn't glorify the act: during the trial, the prosecutor displays photographs of the burnt corpse, but everyone in the courtroom is distracted by the presence of Suzanne Somers.
for even then in the late 80s.
Bonding first with each other, then eventually with people outside their narrow world, O.C.
The question that remains is, did the script writer(s) mess this up, or did the director go another way and made many script "corrections" (they've gone all wrong then)?
Maybe you were that kid, even so everyone can appreciate Jon Cryer's role as the little spaz we all loved to hate back then and loved to torture.
If I compare the quality of this film with similar Hollywood thrillers then it's no doubt one of the best and a must see for all fans of this genre.
If you`re reading this and you`re black but your parents are both white then I`m sorry to tell you this but they are not your parents.
If ya don't like the 18th Angel, then you never understood it in the 1st place.
!Âif you're worried about real-world plausibility, if you're not going to like a film because of a lack of real-world believability, then why the heck would you be watching a film about Satan?!
Abe knew that he unleashed a psycho on society who raped before he raped Jennifer and will more then likely rape again, which he did, and one of his intended victims being his, Abe's, pretty young 17 year-old daughter Emma, Gina Philips.
During the trial Abe found out that Joe is an expert computer hacker and likes to hack into court and police websites checking young ladies who claimed to have been sexually abused and then having their cases thrown out of court due to lack of evidence.
She was a delight then, and she has evolved into a wonderful actress while still maintaining a charismatic presence.
If you like "An American President," or "West Wing" then I guarantee you will enjoy this film.
Edward G. Robinson does a masterful job as Joe Keller, an aircraft manufacturer who shirks the responsibility for providing faulty equipment to the Army Air Force (as it was known then) and allows his partner to go to jail.
Why, then, was he out sick the day the faulty parts were shipped?
The styles and fashions of the 1940s fail to get in the way of the story which seems just as real today as it was back then.
Robinson, in particular, makes the most of a meaty role that has him cocky and confident one moment, then bruised and bitter the next as his past crimes catch up with him--and his conscience.
Robeson is joined in the vocal department by Nina Mae McKinney who scored big in King Vidor's Hallelujah, but was then unable to find decent roles for a beautiful black singer.
But then, you don't expect subtlety from a story by Edgar Wallace, who many blamed for the collapse of peace talks during the Boer War because of his salacious invented newspaper stories of Boer atrocities.
2Âºbefore lost 4 strikers and all the convoy,the rest of the Spanish platoon decided to continue the mission(wow,they are lost,are 10 soldiers,within trucks,radios,food and radio and the mission is in a village taken by serbs militians,) 3Âºin the road to the village they see a car with more kosovar allies,but they decided to left the road and run across a mined field,genius,then they lost a soldier... 4Âºwhen they arrive to village they are easily captured by militiants,(the reason they never use his machine guns) 5ÂºFinally the kosovars retakes the village using the Spaniards stykers,and some of the Spaniard soldiers escapes to the outskirts and kill a pacific famer,and eating the food like animals... awful movie,its more like "what don't do in a battlefield
If you make a movie just to show the action, then don't use someone else suffering to create so called art, but create a fiction story, don't mess with people feelings, or on the other hand, gather facts and then create a realistic movie, what has happened... but it looks like Spanish troops in Kosovo were partying more than others, and have done a movie just to show how "brave" they are.... pity, shame for world cinematography... Spain is not for action, I say stick with Almodavar
Billy is the lovable doofus always getting into a load of junk that is really stupid, such as eating an endless supply of magical bubble gum and then flactuating huge bubbles, just before belching all of the gum up and into the atmosphere, covering the whole world in gum.
I watched the 1985 film Krush Groove yesterday, I must say I really enjoyed it.Now here's the thing about this movie.If you do not like rap, you will probably not enjoy this movie.If you hate very old-school rap(any rap song that came out before 1988), you probably will not like this movie.However, if you like the genre of music, you will probably enjoy this film.I really like this kind of rap.I also like old gangsta rap from the late 80's to late 90's.I also like other types of music such as rock, metal etc.Therefore, I liked Krush Groove.The plot of the film involves a man who is trying to start his own record label, his brother's a member of rap group Run DMC.He starts it after a loan, and it does work, however there is another big record producer who is stealing his artists.He also owes money to the man who originally gave it to him.Meanwhile, a rap group called "The Disco Three"(The Fat Boys), are trying to make it big in the rap game.The movie features music from artists such as Shiela E, Run DMC, The Beastie Boys, Fat Boys, LL Cool J etc.If you like old-school hip hop/rap, then Krush Groove is the movie you should see.
Watch it over and over again, then watch it some more.
Charlie Dalton, the one who takes most seriously the passionate teachings of his mentor, becomes quite the charmer and poet--but then all of a sudden becomes the one in the group who best predicts the political fallout of his actions (to try and get girls admitted to school).
If the boy was too weak to even tell his father his passion, then he probably wouldn't have survived as an actor, either (that's my take).
So he succeeded in stimulating some bohemian feelings into the bosoms of a few college prep kids, but then he can't teach there any more--good job.
I want to hear the sound of more RIP!-" and then the headmaster steps in.
Shame then about the closing part of the story.
This is an interesting script, in that it leads you to believe you're going to have a happy ending, and then snatches that ending away so quickly you hardly know what has happened.
& Stiggs" which ran for a while back around the late 70's/early 80's then you will probably like it a lot.
It has a lot of fine talent in it, but if you're not in on the joke, then it probably isn't for you.
And then we have Ethan Hawke in one of his earliest roles as the point-of-view character.
Now that I am 18 and living on my own, with very different concerns than back then, I turn back to this movie over and over again, to find inspiration, solace and of course, entertainment.
They're on the first floor...and then they hear noises on the floor above...THAT scared me silly.
There was however Cameron Crow that set the high-school genre on it's 'ear' with with the creating of "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" which for me growing up back then was straight between the eyes!
A few of them, are gone now, but that is one of the reasons that I loved this now but not when I saw it then....how strange, but funny.
The problems and ideas for solutions that they have are fun, and the Arizona scenery to me, is nostalgic to see then all that has changed from what was a simpler time to be alive....the eighties.
The film then performed very well both here and abroad.
De Corsia gives an extremely fine performance, as do Bogart, King Donovan, a then nearly unknown Zero Mostel, and Jack Lambert, to name just a few.
So, Bogey and his assistant review the case from the beginning and then all the things leading up to the current prosecution are shown step-by-step.
The words of this racket, like 'contract' and 'hit' are all familiar terms now, but then it was something fairly new.
You go see movies all the time hoping to be entertained, then something like this blows you away and makes all those evenings watching rubbish go away.
but if you want some pure entertainment then this film really does deliver.
if you are a movie snob like me, then sure you can look down on it.
If you like the work of Peter Jackson, or are a fan of the absurd and silly then waste no time and see this.
So if you can imaging Klingons doing a Romeo and Juliet parody, then you can pretty much imaging what the love story will sound like here.
Harvey Weinstein famously used to buy up foreign films and then would refuse to distribute them to American theaters, thus reducing competition in the arthouses for the films he actually decided to release.
They are separated in childhood and then reunited as adults.
And then, the colors.
And then there are few curveballs that are *definitely* ideas of an insane but brilliant mind .
At times it may resemble 'Once Upon a Time in the the West', and then go into Sam Raimi mode during an action sequence, and then go into long scenes developing the melodramatic and colourful love story.
This delightful little comedy is a fascinating glimpse of the first days of the Jazz Age with a never more charming Mae Murray who practically cannot stand still and gives a sweet, amusing performance and then there's the stunningly handsome Valentino, then not yet a star but certainly showing star charisma in spades.
And then I watched the movie again, and Wow!
this is an excellent film that most have never heard of because it was made for TV (turner)and never shown in the theater.not much to add except that the film sheds light on the short and little known 1898 Spanish-American war which while trumped up by the media(newspaper publisher William Randolph Hurst played superbly by George Hamilton)catapulted the up until then isolationist united states on to the world stage for the first time and which gave the united states control of Spanish territories around the globe-Cuba,Puerto Rico the Philippines,wake island,Guam and the Marshall islands.and allowing the united states to flex its military might globally for the first time.there are some historical inaccuracies(such as the imperial German army advisor's aiding the Spanish, director john milius also made the turn of the century imperial Germans the bad guys in his 1975 film THE WIND AND THE LION in which Brian Keith played teddy Roosevelt as president during an international incident resolved by his big stick diplomacy-sending the marines.if you liked rough riders see the wind and the lion.
I enjoyed this movie tremendously, but then again I'm a big Theodore Roosevelt fan.
With the eyes of the world on them, the 'Rough Riders' train (Elliott says, bluntly, "I'll teach them to become killers"), bond (the cowboys are stunned when Ivy Leaguer Noth easily breaks a stallion, then are told that he is a champion polo player), and show complete devotion to the eccentric but beloved Roosevelt ("He's one of us," one cowboy says, proudly).
A child's-captivated-ear indoctrination into the myths which so easily lead us astray (into false hope, then deception, then dried-up going-through-the-motions stub-toed, danceless mere existence) frames what is broader in scope in this film compared to the previous two: there is no age or gender delimitation of focus here as we see random-encounterers young and old, female and male, show their vulnerability to idealized visions which leave them floundering.
Just as Linda learns that she can derail herself entirely if she is not honest or tries to manipulate (trying to control others or their feelings with her bag of tricks whilst living in disguise from and thus not owning herself), so others learn how easy it is to kid themselves into thinking they've found the elusive 'peace' or 'simplicity' which they perceive in an ostensibly uncomplicated lover who then proves suicidal, or other escapist plan which goes awry.
It takes a superb attention span and recall to get to the end of this film in one piece and then you might wonder where you started; but it is worth it.
Even so, you'll have to endure some pretty stiff acting from then newcomer Forrest Tucker in the lead role of Jerry Barton, a pilot who's half of a team that's developed a remote control device for guiding aircraft.
Think about it for a moment, and I know these old films relied on this kind of coincidence, but how is it that Betty and Maude, and then Lambert employee Karl (Jolley), make their way clear across the country from 'back East', and wind up virtually within a mile or two of a remote cabin in a desert, which just happens to be where former Lambert employee Barton is holed up with his partner.
You get then a bunch of scenes of the two- Tucker and the spoiled brat Carol Hughes fighting against each other only to fall in love and the same for Maude and the inventive Doc.
Seriously, the movie Anaconda could be considered having better special-effects then this one.
What happens to the other plane crash survivors who stay behind on the beach & are then taken away by the tribe?
Hopefully if the Jaws 2 Special Collecter's Edition released this coming summer is a success,we might just see that,until then,avoid the atrocias video and Television Versions,Catch this fish at your nearest revival theater and enjoy some cheap thrills in 3-D.
You also see one scene of killer scorpions, and then some "King Kong" ripoff giant gorilla stops by at the end of the movie to stomp on everyone.
They even rip off the fighter-plane scene from "King Kong," as five or sex jets inexplicably appear out of nowhere and shoot at the ape, then just as quickly disappear, never to be seen again.
If you don't have the budget or talent to do the original story justice, then hands off please.
I loved the old big white movie far better then this crap.
We hear a gunshot that is so quiet it's like a dull thump, and then the scorpion just simply whips away from sight, so quickly it almost just disappears.
Their quest is also interesting, as they keep finding more and more planes that crashed on the island, which sets up a nice mystery, and then they're captured by the tribe of natives and we're pretty much in the B-movie fun zone after that.
I know this ISN'T the opinion of everyone--so if you LIKE when he tugs at your heartstrings and helps a damsel in distress (yet again), then you'll be thrilled.
Likely an episode in his life he chose to forget and excluded from his autobiography, the film was forgotten until it's re-release in 1969 with an original soundtrack composed and title song performed by the then eighty year old Chaplin.
All of the circus stunts are beautifully performed and the story maintains interest as the Little Tramp goes from sudden success to sudden failure--and then back again.
I was about 12, surfing the channel on television in my parent's room then I saw Charlie Chaplin did very hilarious stuff under the tent, which come to me as The Circus.
As The Circus left, The Little Tramp just sit on some box and pondering for a little bit before pick up piece of paper with star on it and crumple it then throw it away.
But while "Limelight" focuses mostly on the interaction between the performer and the audience, this film seems to explore two different themes relating to performance: its hypocrisy (the tryout, being told to eat the apple by the director and then being chastised for eating it by the actor), and humour in its deficiencies (note the uproar when Chaplin knocks the table off, exposing the hidden man feeding the animals through the hats).
He looks at the paper star left over from just-departed circus wagons, then waddles off as an iris close ends the film.
But if I'm making The Circus sound like a serious film, then I've been deceiving you, for it is a very funny movie indeed: Chaplin's gags are innovative and perfectly timed, and he always managed to keep his running time perfectly suited to the audience's interest.
When Anthony Hopkins is acquitted, you then seen him at a window, in the jail?, retrieving his personal belongings.
An then, they give it back to him?
If the gun is not back in his drawer, then Ryan Gosling never retrieves it and Hopkins gets away, scott free.
Sure he would have realized this...this guy who set up this unbelievable complex crime and then acted as his own lawyer and got an acquittal.
If you think about this film and its plot holes and cheesiness of the copying of Hopkins' previous roles, then you lose respect for it.
Either he's infallible, then he would have wiped his fingerprints off the bullets in Nunally's gun and he would have let his wife live... OR he's not and his whole plan wouldn't have gone as far as it did in the first place.
But then the film continues.
Well, I guess the joke's on me then, isn't it?
The thing that interested me is that we're then set up for the classic Greek tragedy.
If this were true everyone who had ever put someone in a coma and then the victim died some years later could be retried.
We see a sidelong image of a ramp, then parts of a wheel, but never get to see the ball do anything worth watching.
And then there is Beachum, the lawyer: smug, conniving and ambitious.
Hopkins plays a husband who discovers his wife having an affair, shoots her, confesses the same night and then has things cleverly arranged where it's almost impossible to convict him.
His car is parked in one direction, and then when he goes back to it, it's in a completely different direction.
It won't throw you for a complete loop but rather ties up some loose ends that had me scratching my head up until then.
In many other films like these there's always that the policemen/attorneys (in this case Gosling) fall in love and then mess it up/ruin their marriage because the case is tearing them apart, you know the drill.
Ben Johnson was his employer, then his enemy, in The Getaway, and is a nemesis here.
And then McQueen has to deal with Tracey Walter, a psycho out to kill him who kidnaps McQueens's pregnant girl friend Kathryn Harrold.
It is more 'down to Earth' then most other anime.
If you are capable of looking at this content and understanding its bearing on the story then I highly recommend the series.
Emotive drama gives way to bloodshed and then back again, only this time bring you close to tears as it does so.
Not just the anger and the suffer, what Lucy/Nyuu has feeld when she was just a child and then from that moment maybe always, but as she has start to live as Nyuu after the accident at the middle of the first episode, she has became close to a real character.
Although this does stray from the manga (i've never seen the manga, just know its a lot longer and different then how the animation ended) it is still worth watching.
And if you are a fan of great anime with great background music that is totally contradictory yet totally appropriate to the series, then you have your helping in "more than you can eat" servings.
Once again if you are not comfortable with this kind of scenes, then is likely that Elfen Lied is not for you.
You love them at times and then you hate them at other times.
), smashes the plate glass to the viewing area as Sea World and then, as the water rushes through the broken panel, the shark just sits there!
It scared me then.
La Llorona is said to be a spirit of a woman who, after her lover jilted her, drowned her child in retaliation, then weeps for him, and she wants company so she convinces mothers to drown her children so she has someone to cry with.
it trails along and leaves off like a seven year old making it up at a camp fire and then ending it abruptly when she realizes everyone has stopped listening.
Having said that, if unrealistic dinosaur claymation is your thing, then you'll probably like it.
If this movie is a 1 on 10 then those films must deserve 9s or 10s (and prolly Oscar's).
* (but then, who'd care with this!)
Arguably, the best element about the entirely pitiable project is the enticing title, and then that is also for about 99% inaccurate.
Initially titled "The Dark Castle" I believe... then had a name change to entice an entirely different audience.
If you like 'good bad films' then this one is for you.
If you prefer quality...well then you've been warned.
We visit a torture chamber and examine blood stained instruments of torture neatly laid out on tables, then hear two mothers' testaments of unspeakable brutality, so unspeakable that one mother, who watched as her two sons were tortured to death, literally lost the ability to speak coherently, so unspeakable that a little boy whose head was stepped on and father killed by the invading Iraqi army has refused to utter a word since.
It's best then, as Herzog suggests, to take one out of context of the period, even if seeing the green-screen images (however brief) of the war conjures up immediate associations.
Because the act of setting these oil fields, which were left in a state of disrepair following said "fictional" war, is like facing nature off on a course against nature (fire on oil, then water on fire).
But there's also a daring here that is totally unshakable too, and from a point of view of cinematography it actually goes on par (if not occasionally seems to top) what Kubrick did in 2001 or what Lynch could've done in Dune, which is that a filmmaker uses places and objects that are of this world, but then taking the audience to a place that is also assuredly not so.
It adds a level of mental discomfort, but then that's likely a big part of the point- seeing the oil burned by order of a government that's been on the news we watch every night is one thing (or rather was), but it's another to suddenly take it in another light, where in the realm of science-fiction it asks the viewer to raise questions via abstractions one might forget when taking it as complete truth.
It's a hybrid film that you'd never see this in a cineplex next to the big-bang sci-fi action fare, but then most probably wouldn't want to.
Thus, Herzog succeeds here with the approach he initially planned and then abandoned in Fata Morgana.
If ever a man was fitted to undertake the portrayal of destruction on such a grand scale, then Herzog is he.
As the friends drive out to an isolated log cabin I was thinking The Evil Dead (1981) crossed with a bit of Cabin Fever (2002) & when I saw the woods I was also thinking that the filmmakers had recently seen The Blair Witch Project (1999) along with Friday the 13th (1980) & it's fairly easy to tell that these (& more besides) had an influence on Ghost Game, but then it goes into a slightly different direction with all the supernatural stuff & the game.
We would have turned it off then, but we had hopes it would get better.
The movie was very low budget, we knew that, but at least it keeps you wondering what it's all about, which is more then I can say for a lot of other horror movies, which made this movie at least enjoyable.
The Fox Studios art direction and set design of the 20s is lovingly crafted and expensively produced..... ...and then Wilder runs around like a neurotic infant, screaming and spluttering stomping all over the cast and extras like a male Lina Lamont at a jazz baby Bar Mitzvah.
ok maybe not really but it sure felt like it the first 60 or 70 times i saw it as a kid on cable i loved this movie cause it was so freakin funny i watched it over and over and over again laughing myself hysterical every time and then when i saw it like 15 years later i laughed so hard i broke a rib laughing ok maybe not really but it sure felt like it ya know what i'm sayin
And then there's Carol Kane, who is absolutely adorable.
I enjoyed high school musical 2 it is even better then the first one which sometimes doesn't work and the whole thing nose dives.
It took me a while to realise but i think this movie is better then the first one.
Back then, he spearheaded the effort to change Troy by distracting him from singing.
Personally, the sequel was 10 times better then the original.
The actors seem more confident and the chemistry is better then ever.
These songs are more like just "randomly bust into song and dance" then the other one- making it seem more musical.
I'm sorry to say this, but I find HSM 2 a very bad movie and by all means do not watch it... unless you care for Ryan Evans, who's clearly more talented then all of East High.
I hated it that Miley Cirus was in it as well, im just glad Disney didn't give her a speaking party, if they would've then i think id have to jump under a bus.
If you want a good quality movie then it's best to not watch a Disney movie.
If you want to see a real musical then watch hairspray (2007).
Of course it sounded like he did in the first movie, (only because they morphed his voice with Andrew Seeley, a very accomplished singer), but then the producer let Zac sing on his own and all the songs were low key because Zac can't hit any good notes.
other then that I am completely thrilled.
and the music is even better then in the first movie.
this movie is different then the first one but it has all what made its predecessor so memorable.
The jobs they secured aren't given away to teenagers with no employment record and you don't become an assistant chef because you made a CrÃ¨me Brule and some cookies then complain about it.
Anyone who went to see this film based on its trailers--and who was then, predictably, disappointed by what s/he saw--should consider her/himself an absolute, and willing, buffoon.
At first it's not well received but then apparently folks decide that they like it, too bad he's put a hit out on himself to end it all though and the guy that arranged all that has a heart attack before he can call off the hit.
This is somewhat of a brave movie but then again it doesn't hold together very well at times.
If you have an open mind and a sense of humor then you may like this.
And C-Span is along for the ride as well, doing a "24 Hours on the Campaign Trail" feature, following Senator Jay Billington Bulworth as he spouts (and then raps) uncommonly frank (and decreasingly lucid) truths to his local supporters, and a nationwide audience.
Even if I sometimes agree with the message, there are more subtle and elegant ways to convey the point then spoon feeding it to me like I'm an idiot.
this movie combines EXTREAMLLY well many aspects of American politics that anyone can relate to regardless if you are in the office or not, poor or rich( even if there are some charming attacks at the rich class), disfranchised voter or not.if you are not pleased with today's politics overall then this is for you!
That was then, this is now--and "Bulworth" is truly one of the better film's of 1998.
His Bill MacKay was wondering what he does then at the end of that film.
Beatty stars as a fading senator from California who is so burned out he arranges for a large insurance policy and then hires a hit man.
Though the judge is a gambling philanderer, he's in nobody's pocket, and thus, after taking the bribe, votes his conscience on the case in question, and then opts out after sending his girlfriend (Gia Carides) to the Bahamas with the money.
I really cannot add much more to this then to say that the film is very, very bad and devoid of any merit whatsoever except if you enjoy watching people pour out their hearts only ending in cinematic misery for the viewer built by the foundation of their lack of talent and competence.
And then, after the not unpleasing island sequence (the whole idea of the shipwrecked sailor not wanting to be rescued is a reasonably appealing one), we have to put up with a mind-numbingly miscalculated twist in the plot when morose Jose suddenly reverses character and turns himself into a daringly enthusiastic Captain Ahab, battling a primitively superimposed stock shot of a giant manta ray.
Things really start to get nasty when Bickford then sues her for divorce, alleging adultery on HER part and dragging her through the mud with paid-off "witnesses" who claim knowledge about Irene's "affair".
When Bickford's lawyer announces Bickford is seeking full custody of their son and startled Irene erratically "admits" to the affair and then in hysteria proclaims their son is not Bickford's, no doubt in a desperate attempt to keep the child.
We then see Alex walking past numerous employees who greet him.
From then on it is as though she doesn't exist.
The plot at the end is not going to shock audiences with something they don't see coming but the movie is more a comedy about heist with nice elements of romance and thriller than a serious heist film like The Italian Job,  If you like good fun movies or simply, you loved Rush Hour, then you know what you'll get from After the Sunset  8/10
Harrelson then catches up to them because a cruise ship is in port that is displaying one of the world's largest diamonds.
Don Cheadle, a local mob boss, then attempts to hire Brosnan to steal the diamond for him.
The movie is then a series of cat and mouse type charades between Brosnan, Hayek, Harrelson, and Cheadle.
Unless she likes Pierce or Woody... then it's even and all can be happy!
The thinking behind it is that a director will pull together a couple of actors everyone will recognise, a smoking hot actress everyone will like due to the range of outfits they'll get her in and then clear off to the Caribbean for a few months Â oh, and they'll be shooting a film while they're there.
He ignores his vows that he should be writing for the love of his partner; he becomes confused over his sexuality once his marriage threatens to fall apart and then sleeps with Harrelson's character in one of a few homoerotic scenes after this.
But the film then has the male character of Lloyd chip away at her personality and soon enough, they're together in a mindless and somewhat silly series of scenes.
Women are mere objects and if they're not to begin with then they will be tamed eventually.
It was entertaining now and then but overall, it was too slow and not enough plot to make it worth going to the theaters to see it.
Fine, but then give us something exciting, a story we can get involved with.
And then they put them all in.
The whole movie is pretty dumb, its just Brosnan, Hayek and Harrelson goofing off on an island, then eventually some sort of plot picks up, Don Cheadle recruits Brosnan to steal the diamond, then he gives Don Cheadle the plans on how to do it, but he really is just using that as a decoy so he can steal the diamond.
Even in the 1970's when American films were some of the best ever, Film critics then were also not appreciative of what they had before them.
For communist mum he's a perfect child...always to be seen at manifestations against the Vietnamwar but then the nightmare strikes...Joe falls in love with a female cop!
The film then focuses on her son Joe, and his problems in finding out he is the son of Stalin, and his gradual descent into Stalinism.
As a son who grew up in a family of communists, I found this movie very insightful: the twists and turns of what fervent idealists took to be worker's paradise through the 50s, 60s, 70s and then to the end of the dream in the late 80s/early 90s was very well portrayed, especially with Judy Davis' stalwart commitment, which was portrayed quite sympathetically; the dark side of her family relationships was also poignantly sketched, as were her son's struggles with history: both global and personal; all in all, a superb blend of the comic and the dramatic: a genre it's very easy to screw up and is rarely, if ever, handled as deftly as it was here.
Her meek demeanor and then the cracks in that faÃ§ade made for a powerful performance.
And then there's this cringe-inducing third-act speech.
If you love antique fighters and aren't a nitpick, then this is the movie for you.
How does your perception of life and self change as you fill the hours to pass one more day, then another?
She then asked about the worst movie, a question I had never thought about and Emanon came, no, leapt to mind.
From then on it went down.
If you don't really like these films, then it still may be worth a look!
9/10, but then again I am the drunken_critic.
If you want to get some cheep thrills by seeing a bit of violence and mild nudity then this is the film for you, if you are looking for a cinematic experience don't bother, it'd be a waste of a 3 hours of your life.
If you have been waiting all your life for a movie that could combine insulting predictability with the length of "Pearl Harbor" then this is the movie for you.
The next step in this witches' brew of a film is assembling the most familliar and tired screenwriting cliches, grinding them, stirring them to a boil, and then pouring them out onto the screen.
If the only story he wanted to tell was a nobody wins revenge tale without redemption, flanked by an extremely shallow and cookie-cutter romance, then why waste all the time and money with 1860's New York?
However, if you cut out all the bludgeon/stabbing scenes, then this movie would only have 15 minutes worth of plot/ideas to work with, so I suppose the "filler" was necessary.
In this film, Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) commences the war immediately as he slices and dices his way through the street enmeshed in a series of direct stab wounds yet no blood, but as he progresses and continues his assault, the knives are introduced as blood soaked, then the puncture wounds are accentuated as he pierces his way through flesh and finally we see his face saturated in the blood of others against the intentionally misplaced musical score of Howard Shore (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy).
but if you'd rather not think too much then hey, why not watch Stairway to Heaven.
Allrighty then......like 99.99% of the troma movie line, I look forward to seeing the movies that I see in the previews.....I mean who can't........the only problem is that I found this movie......and 99.9% of the other troma movie lines.......and they are all the same......plain and simple......they are brutal low budget movies which to put it bluntly........ummmm my mother said if you can't say anything nice.......don't say anything.
  If you like Troma's kind of silly, off beat, absurd humor then I'm quite sure you'll really enjoy a whole lot of scenes in this flick as well.
He is reluctant to accept this responsibility at first, but a Japanese chick kicks some sense into him and then goes on to teach him how to use his new found skills properly.>
!While a few effective sequences do exist(notably the beginning of the movie)the overall effect is lame.The film resembles me a TV movie and lacks any scares,gore and violence.The acting is alright,I suppose,but these CGI-effects are terrible and the plot is boring.So if you're looking for a good horror movie,then try to avoid this one at all costs.
Matthew Broderick was kind of good in War Games, not nearly as bad as he was in this, but then he did the American Godzilla and I pretty much gave up all hope for him.
I saw it already more then a dozen in the last ten years and will never get bored of it.
Does Parker really think it is necessary to show a man in a shower with filthy underpants and then give us a close-up of the brown-black waste water emanating from them?
I would like to take a copy of this lame disaster, and just as Mr. Parker wasted a couple of precious hours of my life showing me his sad anal fixation fantasies, procure a jar of Vaseline and then introduce him to new ways of 'enjoying film'.
I remember anticipating a really entertaining, fun movie after I read the VHS box describing the story and then read the list of actors in here.
A shame, because it starts off quite good, then slows to a crawl and the interest peters out.
Complicating things further is Nicole Maurey and her two kids who Parker's fallen for and then Chandler takes an interest when he sees her.
The story then segues into flashback, showing the mission from the beginning up to that time.
Missing too is the pseudo technical claptrap which lumbers much American SF, then or now.
This, and then the debilitating effects of rays that emanate from a hitherto unknown black star are the two principal threats facing the crew.
And even this critique is more of a jab at our collective selves then at full fledged opposition to capitalism.
If you want 90 minutes of Georges MÃ©liÃ¨s mixed with Jules Verne, then you have found the perfect movie.
It's pretty much unknown in the U.S (American - International Pictures dubbed it into English and released it as "Voyage to the End of the Universe" in 1964; it's been seen here only rarely since then).
OK, costumes are very nice but not according to the tradition of that time.This movie can be much shorter then 122 minutes.
That, and also it felt like the concept may have been an idea for a short but was then stretched out into a "feature"...
It really doesn't work because there is no real drama here - I didn't feel like I could know the 4 main characters - the only character who seemed to have an attempt at becoming multi-layered is Renee.. From the mention of wanting to be with a girl and then befriending the waitress, who seemed like she could be a lesbian, a new layer began to unravel for Renee.
The ending was the only part of the movie that I thought made any sense, and then only just.
Because I'm sure you could have found someone who would have done it for free, then again, you'd have to pay me to add my name to that film.
At first he doesn't want to be there but then he makes some friends and eventually gets involved in some kind of chariot horse racing.
This film will not be for all... but if you want to see some great acting and a caring no bars held male relationship, then you must run to see it.
Since then Guest has directed "Best In Show," a muddled mockumentary about dog pageants, and "A Mighty Wind," a film about faux-folksingers that verged on a traditional Hollywood narrative.
But then it starts to go off the tracks.
Christopher Guest is a creative spirit who has been able to make some very funny films like 'Best In Show' where his technique of avoiding a script by giving his cast of actors an outline as matrix for a scene, letting them ad lib the idea a couple of times, then accepting the second or third take as the final product - pasting all the bits together in the edit.
For this viewer this mocumentary about a very bad film company churning out a very bad film with a rather pitiful cast of actors falling victim to Internet rumors that an Oscar is in the air works as a funny idea and social comment for about the first half four and then sadly falls apart painfully as it proceeds to its wholly predictable end.
It would have been funnier if the Oscar buzz was a complete construct WITHIN the set of "Purim", and then later, the realization there was no Oscar buzz at all.
Until then, here it is, for your considerationÂ
Watch then agree, that this is one of the best comedies of the time and deserving of being placed on the list of classics of 1939.
So is his wrecking the Bel-Goodies engagement party, first by his mad ping pong match, and then by his insistence of telling the story of how his life was saved once by an intelligent rattlesnake (not realizing that Mrs. Bel-Goody hates even the mention of snakes).
until then see the movie skin head attitude it's the closest you'll get to the truth through the media.
With all the shortcomings of the era being shown in full detail, we still have to also admit that the music then was great, and maybe even wish that music today could be so good.
Once you have seen this, make sure you check out YMCA Baseball, and then for something completely different, JSA (Joint Security Area).
Do yourself a big favor, see Foul King, JSA, and YMCA Baseball, and then lets start the North American Kang-Ho Song fan Club.
Radio talk show advisor finds himself obsessed with his ex girlfriend, stalks her and then begins to see one of her friends, to make her jealous.
Mr. Leconte rarely overstays his welcome - his films have reasonable running times and they say what they have to say and then they're done.
If this is true then the spy business has to be the most boring profession on earth.
The main character suffers severe injury to his head and hand from a relative fender bender, while walking away from a car accident in which the car he is in, going at full tilt down an expressway, flips over a median and land upside down hitting another car, which then causes them both to blow up within a matter of seconds...  yet he escapes unscathed...
Watch the zoom-in shot at the beginning from outer space to the Meditteranean, it is alright, though a bit clichÃ© these days, then go demand your money back for those of you who have accidentally bought your tickets in advance.
Inspired by a true story, this movie took place in Argentina and Uruguay in 1965 when a couple of gay lovers involved in a money robbery and then hunted down by swarms of cops.
And here's problem No.1 : how and where did those two get to meet each other, how was the contact made.. We watch them separately and then bang!
But then again, some might say whats there to show.
Anyway... And then to the action.
And here's problem No.2 : you can't follow a "minimal" structure of showing things and action and then take the main character alive out of a blaster car accident.
Even though I liked the way it was shown, silence while car on air, and then crash!
Thus, if "Supremacy" is the model of what 007-franchise should have been, then Schoendoerffer's film threads in legacy of John Mackenzie's "The Fourth Protocol".
But then, I'm a sucker for a good car chase ever since I saw Bullit (1968).
The recognisability of it makes it even funnier, especially when you then go back and watch the real news and see those things happening there.
But I was annoyed that Ms. Ross was not even nominated for a Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal in this film - she deserved it and then some!
It contains more laughs then "Terms of Endearment" and also less depth.
All of this is a little hokey, but the performances more then make up for it.
When Aurora starts seeing a therapist (Bill Paxton) and then sleeping with him, people start whispering about her reputation.
MacLaine, in a funny performance, seems more lively and witty here then her original time around.
Shirley Maclaine reprises her role as Aurora and in my view is just as good and sometimes better in this performance then she was in the first movie.
Casper tries to reason with the scientist and then takes the more Tarzan like approach to the problem.
Leticia Bredice is Giselle, the young woman in Montevideo who befriends, then fall in love with Nene.
Every once in a while the plot screeches to a halt while a young woman sings (fairly well) and then two or three minutes later the plot gets back in gear.
Valee sings and talks about the old days of show business, then warns Robert and Jenny that they shouldn't hike to Michael's cabin because they might wind up being hunted.
Robert and Jenny get back to the cabin and have a firelit love scene, then the psychos intrude and do the things psychos are supposed to do in movies like this.
Another skinny dipping scene, then the lovebirds start back toward their everyday lives sadder but wiser.
They go skinny-dipping, get it on by the campfire and are then harassed by two obnoxious redneck goons (played by scriptwriters James Keach, would eventually marry actress Jane Seymour, and David Pritchard).
So then Michael shows up the next morning, and the three friends work through the trauma.
And then the movie meanders along while the bad thing seems to go through the seven stages of grief.
Strange Peter Hooten, then later getting (sort of) raped by James Keach.
Now, in an alternate universe, Rudy Valee would turn out to be the psychopathic killer, who would then proceed to stab Hooten to death and turn his pancreas into a hairnet while Baumann ran screaming into the night...but alas, this movie is nowhere near that interesting.
Since this is a PG-rated film, Baumann's strip-down is discreetly screened by a VERY INCONSIDERATE bush - but then she skips into the shallows and, because of how she's built, you can pretty much see everything anyway.
Hooten soon joins her and then they are leered at and accosted by Keach and his microcephalic companion.
His buddy then, in turn, is more interested in slapping the s--t out of Baumann rather than copulating with her.
The video box suggests that the movie starts with a skinny-dipping scene, with the characters watched by someone with a knife, and then flashes back to how they got there.
These are two different passages (on pain, and on friendship) from Kahlil Gibran's popular (more then than now, I think) book The Prophet.
The campers continually commit suicide as they decide they'd rather go to hell now then be persecuted.
Cartman Sucks may not contain a strong social commentary, but it basically is what I wanted: an episode more focused on an entertaining plot, rather then entirely on an issue.
When I read that "The 79th Annual Academy Awards" started at 5 pm, I assumed that the lead-in started then.
If Scorsese really meant that "The Departed" was his first movie with a plot, then it paid off.
Laughed so hard and then fell apart when Allison started to sing.
After Atomik Circus, the hyperactive Belgian BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde is yet again jumping with young directors and writers in a crazy movie with lots of pace, plenty of ideas and references, a lot of humor (JC Van Damme laughing at the image of himself that was built and then that has spread to all french-speakers in the world after several interviews and comments he made when on drugs again and again, several crazy TV appearances saying stupid things absurd semi-philosophical metaphorical sentences in a very pedantic tone while they meant nothing because he was stoned etc...) and some critics made about current society with wit, discretely etc...He succeeds at making his crazily pathetic character very touching and above all hilarious as always...
And then, I don't know how, I was enjoying the film very much.
If the result is great then it doesn't matter what the method is.
One could overlook that silly comment of the professor, but then he tells me that the Homo Erectus had the unseen power of being able to slash open its opponent, and freeze them from the inside out.
Now, the Ice Queen seems almost "get lucky with Johnny", but then he pulls her into the hot tub and she melts, and turns into a cheap plastic eyeball.
though I did laugh from time to time, so if you can watch it for free and want a good laugh by making fun of all the goofs, then I recommend it.
But nothing happens in this movie for about the first hour, and then there's about twenty minutes of 'horror.'
Now in terms of already expecting a disappointment, I am not not disappointed but still throw up my hands when pondering if cheap CGI is the all sum total future of movies, then I will cancel all my memberships of the evil celluloid corporations and just buy the classics and F the rest.
So in reality, there would of been a military personnel present throughout but then again, there wouldn't of been a movie.
WRONG-if this were real, that person would of gotten fired because all emergency calls have to be taken seriously, but then again if this was the case, there would be no movie.
Now in summary, I can understand that a lot of things in this movie was poor due to a serious lack of budget but if that's the case, then a movie (no matter how promising) shouldn't be made.
Go cross country (on map) to a creek, then tie up the horses and leave them.
This is 1840, as stated, but the US Army did not start using percussion cap rifled muskets until 1842 and even these then were conversions of existing flintlocks, not the nice post-Civil war carbines shown, which, by the way, were issued to cavalry, not infantry.
The plot though, is hacky and takes nonsensical twists and turns (we see the main character fooling around with the blonde bimbo in the hot tub, then later she tells the girlfriend nothing happened, its just silly).
So the movie starts proper and then Hi-Pei Killers come in and start kicking butt; Until First brother is called in.
Every war since then has gotten increasingly more questionable in terms of why we were there and what we were trying to achieve.
But, if one can put that aside, then this is a highly enjoyable movie.
If anything, it is Eddie Sparks who is oblivious to the changes of the times during the Vietnam war and is unable to make the leap from the USO tours of the previous wars to this strange and confusing part of our history and it is Dixie who takes control of the out-of-hand situation in her inimitable style by getting the rowdy soldiers back in line and then not only sings them the quintessential song of the era, but caps her low-key performance with the peace sign!
He then finds out that the rights to the songs he's written have been swindled from him by a Nashville mogul and former business partner (Rip Torn) that he'd signed a songwriting deal with (under the advice of the lawyer the mogul had recommended to Doc).
It then transpires that Lucky's sidekick Slip Moran has got involved with foreign spies who will pay a fortune for the tank plans.
I remember when this show first game on back in 1998 with the Burgerking toys that they had for that month with the Kids Meal back then.
This show premiered on a Sunday night and the first episode was where they let Debbie drive and she put her bubble gum(Debbie was always chewing bubble gum anyone remember that episode where she let one get huge and then it popped on her face and got somewhat in her hair?
Then there was the one where Eliza was tricked by a leopard or Cheata to help them but she then almost ended up getting killed.
The Orgin of Donnie where they return to were Donnie came from and then found out his parents had died from Poachers =[.
I first saw the show in 2001 and even back then, as a kid, I disliked it.
She didn't like him, then she some what tolerated him, then she didn't like him again, then the second he comes back from Equador she's hugging him like they were married.
From then on foreshadowing make the film flow to the end.
First, Jason fails to turn right around and head home as we would expect him to do and then he learns the nature of Grand Daddy's first of many 'gifts.'
I read that this will be Mr. Garner's last film, I do hope that such is not the case, however if it is, then he has gone out on a high note that is a fine cap to his career.
It has a message about a young man who has to find out there is more to life then money, that being apart of a family who loves you is the most important thing in life.
The acting of Abigail Breslin is yet again incredible, I think even better then Little Miss Sunshine, she completely steals the show.
It was everything I look for in a movie, Hollywood gets one right now and then, most of all it was clean and entertaining.
Jack fails to save a survivor from drowning and then begins to see visions of his dead father.
Locke then goes off to kill some more game.
Sun thanks Jin for getting her water, and he replies "That's what husbands do," although up til then, we hadn't seen Jin as a particularly desirable husband, and the next episode, "House of the Rising Sun", gives a closer look at Sun's perspective of how he has been on and off the island.
If you don't want to go come then find another way to contribute.
If only two people have reviewed it (as of my review) then apparently a lot of people haven't seen this.
The ugliest Dogma film looks better then this.
I find bad films much more interesting then good ones, because u can understand what the director meant and see were he got lost.
if you truly enjoy yourself watching the film, really love it in the moment, then i think you missed the point (and probably are kinda scary and desensitized).
Well well after the 2 first Ringu's that i enjoyed soooo much because of the scary screenplays, Ringu 0 brings us a very different prequel with this on, if you expect seeing as much scary scenes as in Ringu 1 and 2, then i hope you will read this first so at least you know that it won't, it is explains about all what you needed to know, with a end you already know but hehe it is a prequel so what else could it have been.
Anyway the movie is different but good with a great acting of Yukie Nakama that play sakoma a perfect way, i mean the way she moves is like ring 1 and 2, gratz for that, she probably needed to train to walk like that all the time :) Only little thing that is a bit dissapointing in this movie is that we would perhaps would have loved to be in a bit more different places, most of the movie is in 1 very same place and start to look more like a theater then really a movie, it gets very good again once they get out of there, but until then the movie had some boring parts, otherwise great movie if you don't see it the same way as Ringu 1 and 2.
Taxidermia 3/10  Taxidermia is by far the most disappointing film of the year, but then again maybe our anticipation and hopes were just to high.
If you like family films, documentaries, thrillers, suspense, comedies, DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, if you like the likes of "la citÃ© des enfants perdu's", "Das Boot", "delicatesson" and possibly even "guinea pig", then you will marvel in this film.
But then it becomes clear that it's yet another fantasy, i.e.
His empty head gets lopped off, the right arm is severed, and some time later he is discovered by one of his customers who then proceeds to display this "work of art" in some trendy museum.
There is no story to this film, just a bunch of kids who crump to cool music and then talk about themselves for a few seconds and then crump again.
But then I got it.
The film starts with historical footage of the Watts riots in 1965, and then the Rodney Kind riots of 1992.
And then enters Tommy the Clown who is a hip-hop clown and I guess celebrity in Watts/South Central.
In Rize, David LaChappelle criticizes contemporary hip-hop for it's exploitative hyper-sexual consumerism, but then proceeds to spend an excruciatingly long stretch of film showcasing close-ups of the glistening Krumpers greased-up bodies in slow-motion.
But I guess for those seeing "Evil Dead" on the cover and buying the game just because this fact is enough for them, if they are satisfied with playing their favorite movie character then I z'think I could also recommend this game to them.
He takes a shine to Jobyna Ralston, his co-star in his best films, but then he's embarrassed by his publisher making fun of his book.
The publisher decides to publish it as a joke to make the public laugh, and then Harold must spring into action quickly to save Jobyna from marrying a caddish two-timer.
I remember the theatre being filled with laughter but back then Lloyd was considered "the funny guy with the horn-rimmed spectacles" and not in the same class as Chaplin or Keaton.
By the way a very funny sequence happens when Lloyd initially thinking it was another rejection letter tears it up and then sees the torn check.
It is then that the film truly kicks into full stride, temporarily forgetting any notions of romance and embarking on a frenetic cross-country excursion that is, without a doubt, one of the most exhilarating sequences of the silent era.
Hijacking every known means of locomotion Â a car, a horse, a tram, a motorcycle, a horse-and-carriage Â Harold storms towards the wedding ceremony with all his might, confronted by every misfortune imaginable and then defeating it with his incredible resourcefulness and quick-thinking.
And then there are cinematographic works of art that remain in your memory forever, that reach down into your soul, that quietly leave a tremendous feeling of immeasurable satisfaction.
The film then inexplicably jumps forward in time some years to when Billy is grown up (and strangely sporting an Australian accent!)
If you're familiar with the 'Cut and Paste' 'Masterpieces' synonymous with the names of director Godfrey Ho and producer Joseph Lai then you'll know exactly what to expect here.
Having dispatched of each opponent Ivan removes their (rather crappy) Ninja headbands which he then sends to Gordon as proof of his kill (although I've seen exactly the same crappy Ninja Headbands for sale for about Â£2.00 in martial arts shops so he might as well have bought a few from there and saved himself some hassle)  Finally Gordon is forced to accept the challenge to stop the bloodshed (although as per usual with these films despite ninja being sliced/stabbed etc there is not one drop of the red stuff in sight!!!)
If (like me) you are into bad movies then you'll no doubt be able to derive a good laugh from this one.
The reason for this is simple, apparently Godfrey and Joespeh Lai found reels of unreleased Hong Kong movies so to make a quick bit if money they shot some Ninja scenes and edited it in to other films then re-dubbed the unreleased movie they was using to make it like it was connected to their Ninja movie, it does make sense since why does the films always have a Ninja plot and a non Ninja plot, wouldn't it just have one plot like American Ninja.
Meanwhile Gordon gets a threat from a Ninja named Ivan the Red who challenges him, he declines so Ivan then goes around killing other Ninja's to make him the ultimate Ninja Warrior.
Ivan the Red keeps discarding these Ninja's until he gets to fight Gordon then he will try and kill Billy, Gordon gets ready to face Ivan the Red and stop him from becoming the ultimate Ninja Warrior.
Being brutally machine-gunned down results in no more than slight bleeding from the mouth (and then only sometimes).
And Harpo's harp sequence is pretty good (he plays Mozart on the harp, and then his two reflections accompany him with other, various string instruments).
AND then, the frail and chronically ill Mr. Thalberg died the following year of 1936.
Their dealings with MGM were then all negotiated through new Studio Head and founding partner, Louis B. Mayer.
If you are really a huge fan of the Marx Brothers and want to see a movie that is really a huge slap-happy time, then this is a movie that I would very recommend that you see!
And Harpo's harp sequence is pretty good (he plays Mozart on the harp, and then his two reflections accompany him with other, various string instruments).
After my wife tortured herself by watching the entire movie, I literally fast forwarded through the it until I saw my car and then shut it off...it was that bad.
I auditioned for Mr. Holden in 1999 for the lead female role (Jenna) in "My Father's House," and remember him saying then - after I asked him what he was looking for in regards to the scene I was about to do - "Make me love and hate you at the same time.
I didn't get it then, but after reading some of these posts about this film, as well as a recent online interview at Rogue Cinema, I do now.
And it was then that I felt myself being tugged, and, eventually, almost overcome at its conclusion.
I felt robbed that I had spent $15 Aussie Dollars to buy it, but then I thought about how the financial backers of this film would have felt when they saw it!
If you are looking for an intelligent action drama, you are probably better served skipping "So Close", however if you want a fun action drama that is so much more better than "Charlie's Angels", then "So Close" is something for you.
After seeing the series then the movie, this is the best Gundam series ever.
With its great animation,mood setting music,close combat edge of the sit plot line,and thrills around every corner,this movie is not for people with weak stomaches!The first time I saw it I was hooked!It blows Dragonball Z right out of the water!If you like great plots,action ,close combat fighting,stuff exploding, then this movie is for you.
But really, if you ever get the opportunity, watch the TV series then the movie, as you will certainly not regret it!
If you're someone who thinks a Gundam is some form of venereal disease then you need to go back to watching Pokemon.
The orchestral elements and electronic elements are mixed together nicely because sometimes they will have nice strings and horns going then kick some nice electric and bass guitar.
-Don't watch it if you haven't seen the TV series but if you have and you loved it then you should have no problem loving this.
when i saw this movie i thought it would be so funny,it didn't really have that many funny parts, there was a couple, me and my sister were cracking up when Kate woke up in the morning and her hair was blue and she went to work because she forgot to get it dyed back to blond,and she used her shirt and wrapped it around her head so the people she was working with wouldn't see her blue hair, and so during her meeting all she had on was her pants a suit jacket and her bra,and it was so funny.then when the shirt fell off her head and she was telling the people that she was fighting with her best friend and everything and then she sat down and she ripped of part of her hair and was like "oh my god i'm gonna be a bald bride"that was funny....it is a chick flick/comedy, for that reason it was good and i would totally watch it again.
Anyway, the girls get engaged within like, you know, minutes of each other, and then, due to a moronic clerical error, they accidentally get scheduled to be married at the Plaza Hotel at the exact same time on the exact same day.
But if you can see a movie poster like this one and not immediately see the arc of the story, well then, you have bigger problems than some guy online ruining the end of a bad comedy.
why do people, then, hate this movie so much?
If you're looking for something light to watch, something just for not thinking for 90 minutes, then it's that kind of movie.
Yes, this is somewhat expectant of a movie titled Bride Wars, but then again, if half of your audience are neglected to the sidelines then you're needlessly cutting yourself short.
What started as a potentially entertaining critique of materialism and shallowness is revealed to be a poorly executed farce, with a succession of lame jokes instead of a plot (then again, one of the screenwriters is best known for performing on Saturday Night Live, where the skits have no connection whatsoever, so that may be an explanation) and two atrocious caricatures instead of leading ladies.
If you're looking for a comedy with weird plot twists and a sprinkling of humor, then you'll still be searching - Bride Wars excels at the former and sadly fails at the latter.
They then schedule their weddings with New York's most famous wedding planner, but due to a clerical error they're scheduled to have a wedding on the same day.
But since there was a time when I first saw Fulci's CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD and just dismissed it as B-movie rubbish (Hey now, don't give me that look -- what did I know back then?
Then again, if you've managed to sit through Fulci's lesser supernatural efforts (ex: MANHATTAN BABY), then you'll do just fine sitting through SPETTRI too.
He then plots to get rid of his opponent, only to run afoul of the sloppy lieutenant on the case, Columbo.
The climax contains some of the best scenes: Columbo's harassment of the murderer with damning accusations whilst he tries to play numerous chess games at once; and then in the basement of the hotel as Columbo perpetrates a crafty plot to confirm his suspicions.
And then there's the ending, which is very satisfactory.
Buono crosses the mob, Gianni crosses Buono, then Bain crosses Gianni.
He then pulls a large package out of the dead man's pocket, puts it into his duffel bag, and leaves the bus.
A guy creates a worldwide spying device and then he's killed in an attempt to steal it.
One of the guys who paid for a hit decides he wants to wipe out the sisters and the cop and then it's all kicking and shooting and wire fu for the last exciting 20 minutes or so.
I saw it back in the day and loved it then and now.
He offers her money to be the surrogate (not quite as common then as it is today) and she accepts.
And actually -a fact that no one seems to notice- there's a lot of interesting stuff going on in football's REAL LIFE -more interesting i'd say, then in these stupid 'goal'-movies where the hero goes from illegal immigrant to winning the champions league in approximately one (1) year.
for an example they start of by showing the "El Classico" from 2006 then they jump straight to the summer (El Classico was in march or april) then they have the bar called Miguel Angel in madrid and Angel is a Barca Icon so the idea of having a bar in Madrid named after one of their arch rivals is not possible.
If Goal 1 greatly exceeds my expectations, then Goal 2 will be the direct opposite.
Cinematography+ Editing: Atrocious Dialogue: Amateurish  And who thought it was smart to have the characters go in and out of Spanish...then randomly go back into English??
There are numerous subplots put into Goal 2, but most times they are superficially touched upon for the sole purpose of covering the ground, and then forgotten conveniently, like the paparazzi photo- journalist, and various incidents on and off the pitch.
What I thought slowed the movie down further, was the injection of Munez's typical stepbrother brat from hell, and mother, who were conspicuously absent in the first movie, then reintroduced here just to amplify the moments that try to touch the heart (like in the first movie with the dad and grandmother), but one without which I feel would not make much of a difference.
And for Arsenal fans like myself, while it's a blast to see the team featured in this movie, and the likes of Jose Antonio Reyes (who incidentally played for Real Madrid few weeks ago and created then scored 2 crucial goals in their final league game to hand them the La Liga title), Robert Pires and a fictional TJ featured alongside our Captain Thierry Henry (don't leave!
Santiago comes from Los Angeles to Newcastle and then plays at the world famous Real Madrid.
then there is the whole is - she - my - mother - and - why - did - you - not - tell - me - i -am - so - sad - and - confused issue paired with the i - kissed - another - girl - and - my - gf - is - mad - now - i - need - to - make - it - up - to - her issue... and he still manages to score game winning an game defining goals.
and then the whole mother thing was also very predictable.
Yes, he does appear in the film, but then so do a lot of the other players.
Anyway, as for the film, I think the makers of the film are so intent on steering the film away from the predictability of most sports films, ie player/team starts off badly, then ends up winning an hour and a half later (well you all know what happens) that it leaves out any real moments of drama or tension.
SPOILERS and WARNING TO MAJOR MONSTER FANS  I read what this movie was about at the hollywood video store and it sounded like it was going to be one heck of a monster fest.I watch the first 20 minutes of it and I turned it off.I just couldn`t believe it.About a hundred F words,a gang dressed in drag and other very distgusting things.We still havn`t found out what the creature or monster was.We then played the and fast forwarded the this filthy film just to see the monster and it turns out to be a worm!
Movie starts with slow motion close-up shootings, fills in with foul language, then throws in a couple sex scenes (including the puppet) and then shot the rest of the cast.
But geez, with stuff like this coming out of them... violence for the sake of violence, murder, extremely thinly veiled references to sex and sex objects (I mean the disinfectant scene with the worm makes you suspect, but then she talks about the worm being phallic just in case we were mysteriously struck blind), and the language are almost unforgivable.
I highly recommend "Doc Hollywood" but if female nudity bothers you, then avoid it.
This then turns to tragedy when he accidentally shoots the heiress...
"Doc Hollywood" is a splendid view of America as it would like to be seen,all the more remarkable then that it was directed by a Scotsman.
It draws you in from the first 5 mins and then keeps you going and yet it is such a simple storyline.
It's hard to believe she could've stayed underwater ALL that time, and then surfaced at just the right moment (unless she had an oxygen tank under the surface!)
Kay uses Dracula to kill her father so she can get the estate and then tricks him into marriage to gain immortality.
And then there is Nurse Packer who believes in procedure and punchcards, Julie Warner providing a memorable 'swimming' performance, fishing without hooks, the squash festival, a great rendition of Patsy Cline's "Crazy", and of course, the Pakistani.
First off, just to let you know, Queen Latifah cannot act, she has about as much acting ability as my left nut, just because someone can go on-screen and play themselves, over and over again, does not mean they can act, second off, I wouldn't even have had to watched this movie to tell you it's a piece of crap, the only reason I watched it's 'cause I work at a video store and it was playing on the tele, even then I stopped looking up after five minutes and tried to block out as much of the useless chit chat they were spitting out, and I can tell I'm not the only one who didn't like it 'cause people where walking out faster then they were coming in.
Five minutes into it and I can already name three things wrong with it, (1) The opening scene, with Queen Latifah doing stunts on the bicycle, Matt Damon as a super agent I can almost believe... (2) Queen Latifah in lingerie, a well pampered poodle is still a poodle, meaning a mutt's a mutt (3) then there's the scene where she's working on her taxi all night, in lingerie mind you, why???
But then after all, we end up wanting a little bit more from this piece that doesn't provide us as it should.
Jimmy Fallon is one of the worst comedy actors in films today , I don't know why or how this ever got made but even then it should have gone straight to video .
In short if you like your comedy with some actual comedy that isn't covered in cheese and then rolled inside a ball of cheese and dropped into a 1 million gallon vat of cheese then don't watch this as its cheesy.
man then what about film, a copy!
As you can see in my profile i'm from Belgium so i saw the original version of this movie ( and it rules by the way :-) ) but when i heard that there was going to be remake done of this movie i thought "well maybe it wont be as bad as every other remake" ( cause American remakes of movies are always less then the original ( no offense ) examples: The Grudge, The Ring ) but again i was wrong, choosing girls in bikini's as the bad guys(girls) was a bad mistake same as choosing Queen Latifah as the cab driver and the way that the story is brought on to screen is also really bad, i also thought that a good point would be the car itself cause in the third original TAXI ( TAXI 3 ) the story wasn't that good but the car was one of the plus points, but that doesn't apply to this movie, so i'll give you one last advice : don't go and see this movie but try to get a hand on the original TAXI by Luc Besson and i'll assure you you'll have a great time  greetings from A.V.
I got this as a free rental, and even then, I felt ripped off.
But then, Hollywood never learned how to fully utilize the considerable talents of Lon Chaney Jr.
I'm tempted to just write "This movie sucks" and then go see the original again, but that wouldn't be very helpful to you guys.
If you are too lazy to read subtitles, well then I guess you are better off with this us trashy version.
If you are not, then get the original from 1998 with Samy Naceri and Peugeot.
It starts off well but then it starts to drag and it feels a lot longer than 97 minutes.
If it's a bad film you're after, then I recommend seeing anything from the abysmal Nazisploitation sub-genre, as unless I'm missing something; they're all terrible!
And then Lise she seduces Starker.
So, if that is enough of a recommendation for you then go for it.
The first scene that told me that this was going to be a white-knuckle thrill ride is one where a roomful of naked German troops are shown some weird sexually violent scheisse films and then are loosed on a number of nude Jewish women to violate.
And then we see them all bloated and trashed on the floor with the charred remains of their feast on the table.
In my opinion, all Nazisploitation movies are treading on dodgy ground and if you're going to use such a touchy subject to make a film that is designed to titillate and disgust, then you might as well go the whole hog.
As much as I enjoyed Minority Report, the film left me bruised with a few bumps on the head after my theater chair also served as an ejection seat which, at times, launched me out of the movie to the roof, then back again.
From then on the hunter becomes the hunted as Chief John Anderton must run from his own officers to determine why he is destined to kill a stranger before they can incarcerate him.
These questions lie at the heart of "Minority Report," and fortunately they are not mentioned then disregarded; the whole storyline revolves around answering them.
That one was paid by the inventor who then afterward committed himself the very crime exactly the way it was supposed to happen which enabled this second crime to be understood by technicians as a simple echo of the first one that was prevented and to be disregarded.
But then he also had to trick his own associate, the main detective of this precrime police.
But a few facts were brought together and sorted out by this cop's wife and then she manages to get her husband free, which sounds quite iffy, and this triggers a full process of truth discovery and public broadcasting.
The point is then disproved by this very contradiction.
An action scene then follows as Tom Cruise (John Anderton) goes to prevent the murder which involves coming out of a helicopter and busting into a house.
They then climb up you and scan you retina; which is much like a finger print, in that everyone has their own unique pattern, representing their individuality.
The majority of the `business,' then, of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia, are crimes of passion.
They predicted that Anderton would commit the murder under the circumstances that he would have been watching the thoughts of the pre-cogs and seen that he would commit murder, and then obviously sought to find out for himself how he could have been expected to commit a murder against a person he has never heard of.
We'll stay away from there then, lol...) with the farmer's daughter white girl.
Some sort of predator is moving across the country, killing all the wildlife and then framing some local predator somehow.
If you want to be scared, or you're expecting any sort of quality or redeeming factor, then I tell you you will not like this.
However bad the script and story was, and it appeared to me that maybe Nunnally Johnson wrote a lot of it "on the fly" - There was actually a core of a great story, and if one ignores the small shortcomings of the film I mention above, then it is fairly enjoyable.
Once in her apartment, he used HER typewriter to write the second letter to himself, which he then mailed to himself.
Much has been said of Chaney's inappropriateness for the part: well, I liked him overall and he was quite effective in his various confrontations with Paige (particularly during the climax, one of the best in the Universal canon) or vampire hunters J. Edward Bromberg and Frank Craven; he may not look like a ladies' man but then Lugosi himself was past his prime in THE RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE!
Saboteur-ess -- withthe opening scene being the crime, and the only person who knows the truth being committed / convicted by the police, with no 'authority' to turn to (except, perhaps, the highest one), and the climax up a long flight of stairs (and then a ladder!
There's a really beautiful moment when Drac's coffin rises from the swamp, and the man himself materialises from misty vapour, then floats across towards Allbritton, who awaits her husband-to-be on the bank.
In brief then, this film is a lot of fun, and one which I always revisit with pleasure.
If you don't like the old Universal horrors then you probably will not like this.
At times this documentary was disturbing, talking about pogroms and mass slaughter; then, in the next scene, the topic will switch to Monty Python.
I kept waiting for the dialogue, acting, scenery, whatever, to create my next feeling or thought and then I realized that I was doing so on my own.
The sequence where Dracula's coffin rises from beneath the muck of the swamp and then glides toward the waiting Katherine, floating over the waters is a clear-cut highlight, looking equally impressive in both execution, creativeness and look.
Being his social inferior, Louise (Joan Crawford) thought she could improve herself by going all the way with him (a big deal back then because birth control was so primitive).
This rash move causes her to get desperate when she senses David's coolness, and then deeply wounded and enraged when he callously ends their affair.
Louise then almost snaps when she learns Carol and David are seeing one another; her odd behavior becomes even odder, telling lies, imagining she was involved in the death of Dean's first wife, etc.
This is where the movie veers off course: Louise confronts David about his relationship with Carol, shoots him, and then ends up wandering the streets and then in the psychiatric ward of a hospital.
Poor Joan has been turned into a freakish cartoon in recent years, but every now and then you stumble upon a movie that only Joan could play, and play well.
Frank goes from disbelieving suitor to infuriated killer to hounded victim to incarcerated suspect to willing vampire wannabe, then back to normal.
And then there is a befuddling conversation between Professor Brewster and Professor Laszlo (the vampire expert) as to why Kay fell under Dracula's spell in the first place.
The special effects include a fake bat that gets more screen time than it should, but some of the cooler images include the first ever bat-to-man transformation, as well as a great scene in the swamp, where Dracula's coffin rises to the water's surface, then Dracula himself floats across to the other side where Kay is waiting.
What is particularly shocking about this film is the way in which director, Curtis Bernhardt baits his audience with snippets of murderous intent that are played out for maximum effect and then, later exposed as merely the ravenously dangerous thoughts of the film's protagonist.
Yet, if Louise can't discern between what is real and what she imagines out of thin air, then how can we, as an audience?
Getting nowhere with Carol in trying to maligned David in what a two-timing rat he is, which is a total lie, Lousie then goes on to confront David threatening to blow him away, with her handgun, if he goes through with his marriage to Carol.
Madness is always best when left undiagnosed, but then it was deemed necessary, and this robs the film of what might have been a perfect ending: Crawford screaming "David!
Mary Louise Parker is also delicious, the acting is great, the storyline very likable, timeless, then and now.
If you are into relationships, you will appreciate it... falling in love, being in love, two people living together, then drifting apart, you just want them to get back together again.
If you are a film buff and the type that likes serious action and great fight scenes, then this is a movie well worth renting!
Bas Rutten is the only reason I would check this out and even then I was embarrassed for him to be associated with such incompetence.
Well, it isn't your typical D movie because poor D ends up fooled without even realizing it...the belle planned beforehand to first have D kill her father, thus inheriting vast estates, then to convince her beau to kill D himself, thus leading an immortal life with him as "undead".
In the end, then, I think this movie stacks up pretty well to other films in the Universal series.
Meanwhile she pursues a willing Young, only to first find a number of men who knew her in the past, and then find that Cabot is getting into her hair.
Lastly, I think the title says it all - although there are people who seem to think that this is just a common sequel title used back then and is not meant to be taken literally.
The Willis character then decides that the two of them must confront the children about their separation.
I just got back from the movie not more then 30 minutes ago and I am still in a mood I have not felt since I don't know when..
He is a wonderful father who connects with his children on a deeper level then one would imagine.
Overall, if you ignore the less then satisfactory acting at times, it is a sweet movie which gives you plenty to think about.
This movie, although extremely realistic and sometimes strong, shows optimism when two persons realize that above the problems, they still love each other and then decide to fix this marriage.
I was single then so I may have deemed it a chick flick and moved on.
He doesn't meet her standards so she snipes, he explodes and then she accuses him of not listening.
She then throws up every mistake he's ever made and every fault he's ever had.
Watching him on camera (where he is high 90% of the time, and then pointlessly shooting thugs for the rest) gives you the distinctive image of Drexl Spivey from True Romance.
All action happens in 15 minutes, then...nothing.
If all it takes these days to make an independent film is for some whack with a cheap handicam to wander around and aimlessly shoot people then suicide may be my best option.
The farmer saves his life hiding him inside a car... and then he's adopted.
I did enjoy this film more then I enjoyed the unrelated precursor, "When Boys Fly", but neither of these films really got me going.
20% of anything is much more then I would've expected, especially from a movie that's kind of a pet cause film.
He had some good moments of comedy, a lot funnier then Myers.
I guess if you think two elephants doing it is funny, then you'll enjoy this.
I was laughing in many of the scenes.I know that many people didn't love this movie and it didn't do very well at the box office and that is considered one of the worst movies of all time but I really enjoyed it anyway despite what people thought of it and that it was a box office bomb.It wasn't the best comedy movie of all time but it was a really good movie.Also not the best Mike Myers movie of all time but it was one of his good ones.I really liked the music and characters and plot 9/10 is my rating If you love Mike Myers then you have got to see this movie.
It'll maybe have one weekend, then go flaccid.
So, in summary, if you want to go spend nine dollars to be able to sit in an empty theatre, then this is the flick for you.
If anybody gets a chance to see an early screening you should def go, if not then go when it officially is released.,
But if you can't tell that from the preview, then maybe you should get your head checked out.
If you can carefully interpret what the movies motifs are then you will think it is a good move.
It has a lot of raunchy humor and it's not so different then the Austin Power movies in the way it's put together.
If you hate Mike Myers then this movie will be your holy grail...the one you hold high and proclaim loudly "See, I told you this A-Hole wasn't funny!"
If you love Mike Myers (as I do, in a totally manly non-ancient-Greece type way) then you'll just have to hang your head and silently agree.
Then read the book, then watch this version of the story.
If there's a bigger cry of comic desperation than limp innuendo humor, then it has to be out of the blue musical numbers that are not funny in themselves, the movie just expects us to laugh at the fact that the characters are suddenly singing for no reason.
It'll maybe have one weekend, then go flaccid.
and then Curly said "It is Moe.
IF you do that, then Erin is what a woman was classically considered to be; dependant, in search of a man, hedging her bets to be with the man most apt to provide for her.
On the face of it seems just a simple farce with clichÃ©d characters but it does then start exploring the characters more deeply in the later part of the film.
We are then introduced to a high school and a new girl at the school.
If you don't like these movies, then maybe its best to avoid 'Wizard of Darkness, as it features unusual situations involving lesbians, among other things.
It seemed as though Andy's catchphrase "yeah, I know" kept on recurring again and again, and the routine of Andy wanting something then not liking it once receiving it became as time-worn as various pantomime routines.
If you want cutting edge British Comedy then go for Blackadder, The Day today, i'm Alan Partridge, Brasseye, Spaced, The Fast Show, The Office or the excellent Peep Show.
If on the other hand you want silly, surreal yet still very funny British comedy then go for Garth Marenghi, The Mighty Boosh, The IT crowd or Even dare i say, Red Dwarf.
Even then, the gross-out is so poorly done when compared to shows such as South-Park or Family Guy in which disgusting scenes are used in context and with intelligence.
This all seemed painfully ironic when after five minutes of the first episode I saw the same sketch, in a marginally different location, then another, and another.
Occasionally dipping into "new" episodes every now and then has done nothing to disprove this.
Finally, it was a personal "shock" to see the wondrous "character" performance of Roman Bohnen again, this overlooked and under-appreciated mainstay of the old Actors' Lab experiment in Hollywood, way back then.
Series One launched it to a wider audience on BBC3 and then BBC2.
The new series -Series 3- maybe less great then Series 1 and 2,but its still great.I like the surviving characters the most.My favorite characters:Lou & Andy.These sketches are just a masterpiece.
If you have a rather strong constitution and like your humor very twisted and gross, then give this a watch.
If you don't mind watching annoying, boring children try to act for over an hour straight then I suppose this might be the movie for you.
The diary reveals the life of the girl and the movie then really begins as we discover what her life was like.
During his stay, he discovers the girl's diary, and then the film becomes a flashback about how she came under the spell of the cinema.
Her achievement is all the more surprising because the movie--her first, and filmed, it would appear, on an awfully small budget--starts out simply and charmingly then quietly builds until it reaches a conclusion that ties everything together without a whiff of heavy-handed melodrama or overkill.
but here i would also like to add, if you are a normal film viewer with no intense standard towards films then you probably should see this one but if you reckon yourself a critic who watches a film from inside out or every thin line comes on the screen then may be you must wait till you hear about it from a mate like yourself, all in all i generously hereby allow 8 marks out of 10.
The whole thing being a set up is kind of outlandish and impossible, but suspend belief and you will accept it, but then again I am the drunken_critic.
And then there's Dave's personal problems with his girlfriend Linda (Marisa Tomei).
I cried like a baby over Candy's dog and then again at the end.
The scene where Ace catches a bullet in his teeth was a bit overblown, but then so was the rest of the movie, and it worked, so I'm not complaining.
Boy does the fun begin then all starting with Lieutenant Lois Einhorn (A.K.A.
If you wanted to see Jim Carrey before he was the Grinch then this is the movie to see!
However, if you're a Carrey fan then get it!
The ripostes and concept originated with writer Jack Bernstein, then were honed and supplemented by first-time director Tom Shadyac and kooked up by Carrey -- all three of whom are credited for the skeletal screenplay.
And if you love bawdy, gut-busting hilarity and stupid pet tricks then this is your "Ace."
100 laughs per hour, if you have a sense of humour, then this movie is for you!!
If you've an ambition to watch every Ealing Comedy ever made, then look it up.
Guinness shows off his dance moves, there's a climax involving a dredging boat, and then a bouncy little song at the end accompanied by the ghosts of Guinness's ancestors (all played by him, of course); the song goes on just long enough to make you laugh like hell at the weirdness of it.
Invest in the first half of this film, and then, let the debates begin!
Perhaps then people would get some idea of what 'going to war' can lead to.
If you are looking for your typical shoot 'em up war movie then move on to something else.
If one man, in the case of Schindler, or a small group of men, in the case of the ones in this film, can maintain their sanity, faith, and values in a world that has gone insane, then there is hope for mankind.
I think they paid a couple of monkeys a few bananas to knock together some notes on a keyboard and then they just made up a few words to go along with the song (if you can call it a song).
If you have seen the original Walt Disney Pictures film, then you might have seen the TV series.
The order I suggest to follow if you haven't seen any of the Ringu films: start with Part 1, then Part 2, then Part 0.
If they like the movie then they will tell their kids and it happens all over again.
LOL  If you liked "Aladdin," then you'll LOVE "The Return of Jafar!!!!!"
This sequel is unworthy of Disney legend:  First, the bonuses are a shame: no additional animation and only the choice to see the songs of the movie (what is the "scene selection" for then ?).
Jafar then makes his next move with Abis Mal by capturing the Sultan and Carpet and trying to kill Al but sparing his life.
She then returns to the palace... only to transform back into Jafar.
He then reveals his plan to Al's pals and takes off in Jasmine's disguise.
LOL (This is the second time that Al nearly dies, but is then saved by Genie.
He then forces Iago to set a trap for Aladdin.
This film is worth watching only for Dan's appearance; if you're not a fan of his work, and you are a fan of the original, then seriously, avoid this one if you don't particularly feel like ruining what the first one did to you.
(Lewis Milestone tried to borrow first James Cagney and then Humphrey Bogart for the part.
If you want to see a film that deals with the same subject matter then rent Leon: The Professional.
Not understanding that Dafoe was gay at first and then realizing in hilarity that he was, I laughed my way through this absurd attempt at a good independent film.
After reading handfuls of good reviews on this site, and then reading many comments that said the bad reviews are wrong, I sought out to purchase this film.
I seem to recall one of the commandments that states something like "thou shalt not kill" well then these brothers must have slept through that part of their heavily religious upbringing.
The showdown at the end is a little less intense then the rest of the movie, but still, nonetheless, works!
If it looks like a movie and it sounds like a movie then it must be a movie right?
However, Memento uses it to keep the movie watcher guessing until the very end, whereas Boondock Saints puts the pieces on the table, letting you try to put them together, but then will continue handing you pieces until the picture becomes clearer.
Of course, the characters are a bit shallow every now and then and one would love to learn more about their background, but that's only a slight criticism.
***SPOILERS*** Far better then you would expect crime drama involving a New York Cty magazine writer Johathan Fisher, Christopher Reeve, who's job is on the line if he doesn't come up with a major story for his magazine and come up with it fast.
Despite being a vicious and murderous pimp which is the exact opposite part, as the perpetual good guy, he's been playing since then Morgan Freeman's film career took off and never looked back after his chilling performance, as Leo Small/Fast Black, in "Street Smarts".
Christopher Reeve more then held his own against his co-star by even having Freeman as Fast Black work him, he Chris Reeve the Hollywood Superman of the 1970's and 80's, over and have him almost wet his pants by doing it.
In a role far removed from the calm, authoritative, and wise persona that has been his stock in trade in the years since, he shows his true range, portraying a cunning, ruthless and also intelligent criminal who can come off as genial and welcoming and then turn on a dime and reveal the ugly side lying underneath the smooth exterior.
She then runs off and leaves him to the tender mercies of another lovely vampire who teaches him how to feed his own hunger for blood.
The serial killer then struggles with his conscience and his sanity--all leading to a somewhat twisted ending.
In conclusion Ring O does add depth to the trilogy and deepens rather then clarifies the mystery and in the same way to the recently released Starwars prequels, infuses the film's near one dimensional monster with a sense of depth, which serves to draw pity from it's audience.
This movie involves sixty minutes of losers from the 1970's riding around in a Winnebago while listening to some skank-hippie chick recite "The Raven" by Poe, then run into the ghosts of Confederate soldiers who lead them to the plastic Halloween candy skull of their captain.
So anyway, the dog face that 70's boy keeps flirting with has some psychic visions, the fat dude drinks some beer after the RV stops, then they all go wandering in the woods for some reason unbeknownst to me.
They all meet up and start a bonfire, then a bunch of "ghosts" gather around and start talking about some crap you can't make out.
A scene is then played in which a bunch of guys in civil war suits shoot at each other from long distance in slow-mo, with the victorious battle music of-you guessed it, the RV MIDI file rockin' out in the background!
She looked at the box and then at her husband and he just looked at me.
The uncut version shows a mafia soldier getting dumped naked into a tub of acid after the villains have cut off his genitals--yes, you see a super hairy cock & balls slashed off and then shoved in his mouth before they tumble him into the acid bath.
Tony fights three of the Don's goons before getting his privates sliced off with a knife..he then gets his penis and testicles shoved down his throat before being tossed in Vito's acid vat!
If the opening scene where Ricco's father's face is shot in point-blank, then this gory sequence of events does.
From then on, "Cauldron of Blood" turns into a tremendously exciting macho-showdown between the charismatic young blond hero and the sleazy old bastard, with treasonous characters, lurid ladies and a whole lot of bloody gunfights.
If you sleep with his sultry girl-friend you get castrated in graphic detail, fed your own penis then you're thrown in a tank full of acid (that's how he turns people into soap).
and horrendously offensive "Rape!13th Hour".In 1979 came Koyu Ohara's "Zoom Up:Rape Site",notorious for a scene in which a rapist shoves a light bulb inside a woman's vagina,then stomps on her stomach until it breaks.
She manages to catch the eye of Maurice Ronet and buys him lunch, then leaves the restaurant without saying goodbye, causing him to go through a series of both funny and sad adventures in his efforts to find her.
It seems like they didn't know how to do the scene and then decided to make a musical out of it.
Maybe then people will understand what kind of damage they have caused and stop and think about it.
The only problem is that now the plot seems a lot tamer than it was then.
It is 1) unrealistic that Irene Dunn, missing at sea for seven years, should reappear on the very day that husband, Cary Grant, has succeeded in having her declared dead and then, moments later, remarried in the same courtroom and 2) that Grant's mother would not have attended the wedding; presumably the writers needed Dunne's mother-in-law to be in when Dunne (who naturally would not have known about the new wedding so would have no reason to attend and try to stop it) resurfaced though a little thought could have solved this.
Movie moves into high gear when Nick (Cary Grant) sees his first wife as the elevator door closes in the hotel on the way to the honeymoon suite with his bride and he's on the spot to break it to his new bride but then finds out his wife was stranded with a hunk of an anthropologist (Randalf Scott).
And then there's the scene of Grant looking through women's clothing, holding them up to a mirror, while telling a doctor, "I have to go, he's waiting for me in the car!"
And then there I want to add why I really liked POE: No talking animals.
Grant starts to feel a little less guilty then.
It helped you build a person to person relationship with the character, rather then seeing her as a 'mean' abused child it portrays her as just an abused child.
You sort of take pity on her through this movie, rather then thinking she's an evil spirit trying to raise hell.
Since then I've learned a lot about this movie, how it was made, and when.
More often then not when that happens the motion of the film just stops as we watch the dialog scenes.
Lugosi gives what is more often then not a nonperformance.
(The reporter comes off as an annoying chipmunk) When I watched the featurized version of this a few months back I stated that the only thing worse then that was the full version.
However this scores over the feature simply because it has more chapter endings and serial like adventures then the feature.
First it leads onto Nitro's manager J (played by LAYON GRAY) and then onto Shayla (played by Erica Goings).. Are you following me..?
OK this movie was worse then a b grade porn movie.
Was when they were sitting in the office and they were about to be tied up with the tape and then the chic i cant remember her name gets the gaffer tap and she gets knocked to the ground by nitro.
And then when nitro is getting to the girls they are all tied up.
then we can go to the horrible acting "us girls should stick together" "yeah us girls do need to stick together" Me--> "I hate my life" seriously I wanted to put out there use a better format than mp2 cause it will jump frame rates.
Fortunately, one of the female leads, Kenia Brown, is stunning and athletic; unfortunately, she only appeared in one more film after this and then disappeared.
First, it's Barber of Seville so we can hear Tibbett do "Largo al Factotum" - and Tibbett's is the version I was raised on; then after an angry fit, she decides to do Carmen - thus, we hear Tibbett do "The Toreador Song."
In the beginning, she's angry that the Metropolitan Opera did not cast her in "La Sonambula" - a patently coloratura role, then she assigns herself "Barber," a coloratura role, and finally a mezzo role, Carmen!
Well, set it in a fish market, for one thing; then have your mysterious drifter - who turns out to be not only not mysterious but not even very unusual - act the whole movie with a single look on his face.
They then challenge him to a game of baseball where Bugs has to play every position, plus having to catch up where the Tea Totalers left off, behind 96-0 or something close to this score.
And if this is true, then Christina's childhood must have been hellacious indeed.
Now and then the sweet-natured visiting cousin, Jenifer, offers a fresh breeze of hope, but wow, how she gets caught up in their poisonous existence.
Back in 1789, they needed the extra time to make sure that ALL the votes across the country were counted, then delivered by horse, and then they needed to set up for the actual Electors to cast their ballots to finalize the Presidential Election.
The studio put her in B films and then blamed her for slipping at the box office.
Here, he is a dupe at first, then a decoy at the end, and in between sort of a standard-issue government official (albeit a rare honest one).
Clark heads up a small, elite squad that then begins going around blowing up labs and generally disrupting the drug business.
This in my eyes is a true classic, of a man getting caught in a situation way bigger then he can explain at first.
Also to the character Jack Ryan getting thrown / Betrayed into a conspiracy to send troops to stop the drug trafficking and cartel, and then uncovers the truth, and wants nothing more then to get those troops out after they were sold out.
And then couple of months later, you don't even remember if you watched the movie or not.
It's also then that the movie its horror elements really start to kick in and the Sadako character starts to become the evil spirit we all know from the other Ringu movies.
If you have read the book and then look the film, you think that it isnÂ´t the same.
Fun part of this movie is how the computer kid solved the password in 5 seconds during the first part of the movie, while he was given all the personal "paper" data on the people involved and then was challenged with a serious job at the end.
Simply put, he was more believable in the role then the other actors who've tackled the role.
Far more cynical and sophisticated then its predecessor, "Patriot Games", Clear and Present danger dares to suggest that the world isn't made up of good guys and bad guys, but just a whole lot of people out for their own conflicting and selfish interests.
In this regard, it is both deeper and realer then the movie it sequels.
The film then moves to the Presidents issuing of an order to assemble a team of elite Hispanic commandos to infiltrate Columbia and wage a silent war on drugs.
Jack Ryan discovers the whole operation while at the CIA, confronts Ritter, and then goes to Columbia to save them.
The two men then embark on a journey to find the soldiers, and eventually find Ding Chavez, hiding alone near a jungle stream since his comrades have all been shot or captured.
These three then storm Cortez' compound to rescue the other soldiers and make their subsequent escape.
Tom Clancy's storyline is much more in depth then the plot line of the movie.
I felt this film, was way better then Rottweiler, or Faust, which suffered greatly from a miscast lead.
Even then it can't hide how unevenly lumpy his execution is.
The things which happen almost seem at random, zombies start to pop up everywhere but there's no real explanation of how or why & then there's this black slimy stuff which is mentioned on a couple of occasions but no more & then there's the villains lame motives, as far as I could gather all he wanted was to take the new town as his own which hardly gets the pulse racing.
I'd say: if you enjoyed FAUST: LOVE OF THE DAMNED, then you'll probably like BENEATH STILL WATERS too.
And if you don't dig it, then you probably didn't like much about his other films either.
Things start off fairly well for a low-budget adaptation of some pulp-horror bus ride throwaway, and then the whole affair sinks beneath the weight of a tired plot, at times horrendous dialogue, problematic acting, disappointing production values at key junctures, seemingly indifferent direction--even the obligatory bare boobies and revolting gore couldn't save this turkey.
He then takes action.
The book mentions that there are 10 ways too see ghosts so the 5 people venture off to see these ghosts then one day after they played about 3-4 of them there friend disappears when playing one of the games.
They also never really resolve the problem since one of the main characters for some reason has the power to stop seeing ghosts bought the book then his grandmother figured out that somebody is putting a spell on them.
I personally liked the setup a lot more then the execution of the rest of the movie.the beginning started out pretty well with some interesting team ghost seeing but ultimately failed due to disjointed story telling, and decent CG effects.
The first opening scene, I figured this movie was going to be a weird horror film... and then it just ventured off into an incoherent teen horror.
I must say, some of the starting scenes were creepy, but then they just totally missed the mark and put in unnecessary techno music.
It starts serious enough and it was going in a good direction, then I don't know what happens.
If not the best film of the year, then the best animated film ever.
For people who think comedy and thriller/horror in one movie is bad, then you certainly don't like this one and you don't like the American's "scary movie's" also.
I settled down, and at the start it seemed as though that was exactly what we were going to be treated to ... but then it all went downhill.
There were some great scary moments in it, but then you'd get an attempt at some at comedy.
I consider this film more like a throw back to classic 80's horror stuff like Night of the Demons or even Sleepaway Camp 2...meaning it's suppose to be fun then a straight forward horror movie.
I think this movie is like pointing a gun at a child's face watching them scream moving the gun away from them then pointing the gun over and over again at their face disturbingly funny yet immorally wrong, why don't these actors think am i actually in a movie like this or why Michael Dudikoff is in any film for that matter.
If you like no nonsense action films then this one's for you.
Yuri then pulls the jeep on top of himself, while being gnawed on by alligators.
even now, years later, i vividly remember how a gangster boss gets shot up: first, they cut the power and come in with infrared goggles and shower everything in bullets, then the bad guys catch on and put on their own nightvision gear - they are prepared, of course.
Well then, apparently with El tigre de Santa Julia Gamboa tried to turn on a wilder side maybe in sake for his filmography.
In this short we see his knack at mixing live-action and stop-motion as two gentlemen at a table have plates of food and eat them up... then they eat the forks, then the plates, then the table, then the chairs, not to mention their clothes, and we see how their mouths suddenly flip over to stop-motion for just that bit of mastication and then back to the real human forms.
I mean, the warming relationship between Angus and his grandpa is tear jerker (specially before grandpa dies), but then it picks up the teenager situations.
Angus is a story about a boy that suffers from being bullied, betrayed by his ONLY geeky friend, and then loses the most important person in his life : his grand father.
I then went to Best Buy only to realize that Angus is not sold on DVD and VHS is near impossible to get a hold of.
Angus then must face his insecurities and step up.
If you're looking for a realistic movie about high school and you were different from the rest of the crowd like I was, then Angus is your movie.
Angus has always thought that the key was to be more like Rick (Van Der Beek) but then realizes that he truly needs to be himself.
It's definitely one of the best recent horror sequels I've seen, but then again it doesn't feel like a sequel as it seems to fit in like it was the second half of the original's story.
Watch Ringu 1 and 2 then watch The Ring, you'll understand why some of the set pieces in the remake are so out of place.
The continuation of style, situations and characters from the first film, prevents this from just being an unrelated sequel, but it tends to ask new questions and then provides no answers.
Kanae is sweet and cute and seems undeserving of the fate that the reporter gets her into, by shamefully manipulating her and then lying repeatedly until it's too late.
The scene where the reporter then tries to conveniently erase his guilt along with footage of Kanae backfires on him and provides one of the film's memorably eerie scenes (but also one of the confusing plot threads that I didn't really understand until reading the FAQ at RingWorld).
- The reporter who said he would then never watched the tape being freaked out when trying to erase the tape of the now dead girl.
- When they see Sadako's mother combing her hair in the mirror (what you see in the tape) the way she glides out of sight behind a wall then peers round.
If you've never seen Ring 1 and 2 then you should go and see them straight away they are the best Horror films of the 90's (well Ring 1 is, and 2 is not far behind).
And then the prison scene in which Elsie (his new llama or lamb) tells her father that she is unable to learn under the harassment of a male student, to which his non-response includes the same transcendent jargon he used in the cemetery prior to his vicious assault.
The counselor then starts explaining how attraction starts, by using this word.
On the surreal side- you have an abrasive homeless jerk who becomes an angel, an engaged man who decides he'd rather hang with miniature party buddies instead of getting married, and a man who shaves off all his hair for a beautiful woman and then turns into a chair at the end.
There's Mike Connors (Mannix), and then a lot of gun pointing, and, pardon my sexism, cat fights.
Perhaps it's the extra touch of authenticity Crawford brings to her portrayal (Mary Tyler Moore played a later version of this upscale shrew in Ordinary People; then of course there's always Martha Stewart).
I mean an innocent Del Toro is killed, only to end with a crazed Penn lighting up the family and then blowing his brains out?
This film would have made a great gangster saga but Ferrara and writer St. John are more interested about the characters then the story.
I can't go into it any more without swearing, and then my review won't get put up.
I was quite surprised and then I came across this one rather cheap.
Fortunately "The Funeral" is far from being rubbish, but then it's not great either.
If you can sit down and watch a movie that chooses atmosphere and character over action, then I highly recommend this movie.
And then slap him upside the head.
Maybe the script/screen writer can expand it further by showing the audience how "brain" look like inside the head and human lung, heart, liver etc then it even worth too seen this movie as part of human entertainment.
This movie was one the first movies i watched and I loved it then and I love it 10 years later.
He's stolen by the villain from "UHF" and injected into Martin Short instead, who then must save Quaid with the help of Quaid's girlfriend, the pseudo-lesbian Meg Ryan.
Anyway, back to InnerSpace, which is a 1980's update of the Fantastic Voyage scenario, in which a man is miniaturised and injected into the body of another man; Lieutenant Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) is the pilot agreeing be shrunk down to near-invisible proportions and then injected into the body of a rabbit, only for the experiment to be interrupted by evil rival scientists who want the all-important microchips necessary for miniaturisation.
If you enjoy suspending disbelief and you appreciated "Gremlins", then this new offering form executive producer Steven Spielberg and director Joe Dante is guaranteed to keep you thoroughly entertained for over two hours (though you won't believe you've been sitting down that long).
The film is so bursting with invention that often things are touched upon and then dropped before they've really been explored.
But then, a terrorist group seizes the lab and one of the scientists carries the hypodermic out.
If you have an interest in Native American culture or really just appreciate a perfect script and a beautifully made film, then this is your movie.
If it is just to be a kind of 'gangsta Western,' then it needs far more and far better action, or if it's to be a comedy, then it needs far more and far better jokes.
Some stuff happened, I think, and then the film ended.
If this is true, then, as viewed through the looking glass of time, that snake's brave and noble sacrifice was ultimately in vain.
Zippers weren't around back then - they weren't invented until the early 1900s.
And then pulled behind a wagon through a mile of cactus and dropped off a big cliff into a deep ravine full of giant man eating ants.
Did anybody else mention the introduction scene for Kansas (Kurap, by far the lamest actor I have ever seen,) where we see three of his cards being a King, Queen and Jack of spades and he then calls out that he has a full house?
They're showing us a straight flush and then.....ugghhhh.
And then the lady with the dynamite on her belly, who cares?
What kind of idiot robs someone by strapping dynamite to yourself and then standing thirty feet away from them?
If you want a serious movie, don't get this, if you want a drunken laugh then only get this if ALL of the 80's horror films are already hired out.
Every now and then viewers would like to see a loving relationship, so we can ohhh and ahhh.
I actually wish they'd listened to the locals and left the mine closed, as then there would have been no reason for this film to be made.
It starts a killing spree while possessing, then, it hides under Samantha Eggar's sheets (dirty hand!
Demonoid, Messenger of Death starts some 300 years ago in a Mexican mine where some ancient demon or other possesses the left hand of a woman, she is chained to a wall by robed religious fanatics & her left hand is cut off with an axe the disembodied hand then tries to scuttle away but a guy stabs it & places it into a silver hand shaped casket.
There are surgical removals & one is severed by repeatedly shutting it in a car door & the hands preferred method of murder is to attach itself to someone's face & then squeeze it until the person dies!
I can't really recommend it as most sane people would probably hate it but if your a fan of obscure exploitation then this is an absolute must.
The Baddies are out to get the plans of the Allied fortifications for the Suez Canal to eventually control the region and then the world ... How they go about it, get it and lose it is as ingenious as it is ridiculous but as it's the McGuffin it's not that important anyway.
But then, maybe we aren't supposed to.
With its dark, dreary nature and often painful sequences, NOW AND THEN, HERE AND THERE is not an easy series to recommend; however if it's emotionally powerful Anime you're looking for, then this series may be worth a look.
Unless of course there's a fight scene needed, then the baddies get hit over and over again before they finally get knocked out.
Unless the baddie has had a bit of screen time, then he'll be much harder to kill.
But then, every single character in this movie is a cartoon character.
On the plus side, the brilliant and then beautiful Elaine May (future director and writer of many a film flop) may be the greatest crazy Jewish American Princess ever portrayed on film.
Furthermore, ALW presented his new masterpiece The Heart Is Slow to Learn sang beautifully by Dame Kiri Te Kanawa, and then a young star Lottie Mayor performed Whistle Down the Wind in the most engaging manner with Sir Andrew himself at the piano.
And then, almost towards the very end, Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber himself came out and personally introduced Dame Kiri Te Kanawa to the audience.
And then, the entire cast came out to sing "Happy Birthday" to Sir Andrew, with Kiri Te Kanawa and Sarah Brightman soaring above the entire orchestra and chorus.
So if you feel that this wasn't good because it wasn't as comedic, then i think you completely missed the purpose.
I agree with one of the earlier posts that ppl must be getting offended 'cause he's officially made fun of everyone and if he hadn't yet, then this routine touched that last nerve on the so-called "hard-core" supporters that think that his best yrs are behind him.
If you are the kind of weirdo that would enjoy such a treat as this 'film,' and I mean that in the best possible way, then this is the one for you.
And then there's the content.
See it anyway you can, then demand the set on DVD!
It's just an OK Ford film but he made some better ones then this one.
That's common nowadays, but not back then.
She then goes to Sherlock Holmes with a rhyme she found among her husband's things.
She made a little splash in early musicals ie "The Cuckoos" (1930), "Hit the Deck" (1930) then in 1932 she was named a Wampus Baby Star.
during this turbulent period was Robert Florey, who had directed THE COCOANUTS, in which the Marx Brothers made their film debut, and co-authored the script of FRANKENSTEIN, then adapting and directing MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.
Temperature rise in 300BC melted the Alps for Rome to exploit all year round and then in 450AD it got colder and we got the dark ages.
Unlike the adult films of today, movies back then aspired to be "real" entertainment.
Peaches then sets off to find who she 'really' is.
And then Magnum drafts his two best friends, Rick and TC, to help him with the case.
when by chance I saw an episode I now recognize as a third season one; I was puzzled then since I realized I was missing something from the life's stories of these intriguing characters: it was like intruding in someone else's life, more than a pi standard TV-movie... That's it: I believe you're hooked by the believable interaction of the main characters, their likes and dislikes; some episodes are quite 'poor' and unbelievable, but never awful; other episodes are more complex and well shot; but almost always you'll have some fun with them; and finally Magnum's off screen voice is capturing your attention, and make you another close friend worth of his confidence... After so many years, one day I just missed that feeling and I discovered the two first seasons were published on DVD, so now, after watching them, I feel reassured of not being a 'stranger' in Magnum's world anymore....
*may contain spoilers*   I vaguely remember watching Magnum as a child and liking it then.
Something becomes so popular that I decide it just can't be anything worthwhile, and then I find myself doing a complete 180.
And then one Thursday evening there was nothing on the network channels and nothing on any cable channel and I flipped on CBS just as Magnum P.I.
And then there was the gunfight at the end.
And then the next season or so there was the two hour episode that introduced Magnum's and T.C.
And then I found out that he worked with Orson Welles as assistant director for Chimes at Midnight and Don Quixote being also responsible for the butchered 1992 DVD release of the latter film.
Why a four then?
I have to comment on Galloway Grumblefield's reply because I'm another white person (20-something male) who share's his/her sentiments and then some.
It certainly made me laugh, as well as cry, especially the end after Shane arrives at the Pow-Wow in Alberqueque & sees in the people there, some of the elements of the people in the stories that he was told by his grandfather before he died on the way, then watching him beat the drum to start the storytelling and remembering what he was like at the beginning rebelling against everyone & everything.
I guess if you're into the whole humorous British petty (or not so petty) criminal genre then you won't be offended by anything you see here.
To add to the general tone of strangeness, there are brief moments inter-cut throughout the story where the characters, seated in some antiseptic all-white room, are discussing their relationship with Virgil, and we're not sure until the end (and maybe even then) where they are, or if he is dead or alive.
In other words, if you are open to new ideas, enjoy movies which go outside the box, and are a free thinker, then Darjeeling Limited is for you.
But if you are on the conservative side and more apt to rent a family-oriented, typical Hollywood melodrama, then this movie is not going to be your cup of tea.
Maybe Schwartzman as screen-writer wasn't the best idea, then again Coppla's "CQ" was okay at best, so who knows where it went wrong, and though it could have been worse, and wasn't that bad, it just left me kinda disappointed.
But then again, that might be why I loved it so much.
I can see the brothers as a branch of the brood in "The Royal Tenenbaums", with the luggage representing the emotional baggage with which the father left them (and then what they do to the luggage at the end).
There's a lame joke about an escaped tiger eating one of the nun's brothers followed by the mother making breakfast for the brothers and then disappearing.
The audience are always one step ahead of the authority figure so know fine well how the victim died ( Usually by a camera being thrown in their face or something resembling bees superimposed over the camera lens ) so in order for the plot to go somewhere the running time is taken up with the authority figure meeting a beautiful doctor/scientist/vet so we get a romantic subplot , then about 2/3rds of the way through the movie after the authority figure has consumated the relationship it's then he realises people have been getting killed by cameras being thrust in their face/ rather poor animation and then races to save the local population against superimposed bees   There you go , another by the numbers thriller with deadly bees .
It's just as well he's good at what he does then, isn't it?
Sadako then ends up with the leading role in the play but when the meddling reporter slips a tape in that isn't meant to be part of the play, it changes everything and Sadako's telekinetic powers are unleashed on the unsuspecting audience and cast, but stopped just short of harm to anyone....except, herself.
In fact, with Shutter and Dorm, I'll say that Thai movies are beginning to play better than most Hollywood cash cows, but then Ghost Game came along and destroyed my conviction.
I reckon i would have liked it then as well.
The bloatedly egotistical writer/director, who's way too in love with his Harvard degree, wasted a decent idea by creating one-dimensional characters and then casting with second-rate actors -- none of whom is a complex-enough/bright-enough person or skilled-enough actor to convince viewers that they're Harvard students or instructors -- who turned in one-dimensional performances.
One soon gets the feeling that the movie was started with little passion from the director, then finished in a hurry to meet a deadline.
I hated it initially, then right at the end, I realized that I actually enjoyed it.
However weak this pitiful plot device is, and believe me I almost shut this movie off right then and there, it does get the real plot going, which turns out to be fantastic.
The director then cast Adrien Grenier in place - thank god!
I love it when movies inject philosophy into the plot of a film because the film is then acknowledging that something is supposed to be learned by watching it and therefore it isn't stupid.
Even then, don't expect too much.
So if you wanna add more to #2 and don't really wanna see #3 I suggest get a paper and pen and then write down what you think would've happened, what you would've done differently in either #3 or both of the movies.
The movie starts out with "flashback" scenes from Dracula 2: Ascension... then has them on a quest searching for Dracula and Elizabeth ... Luke's beloved.. and the priests immortal enemy.
Dracula and the priest fight.. Elizabeth helps "save the day" and then begs her love Luke to kill her..
I really hated the ending of this movie and thought it was complete B.S  That and if Dracula's face changes after every regeneration (im guessing every time he's roasted,toasted, and burnt to a crisp .. then WHERE the heck did this guy come from?
Well, I think it because they're thought of by all as mysterious and sensuously alluring, but then again that's just me or do other people feel the same too.
And then the actual story would get next to zilch screen time.
He was kind of cartoony, but then vampires aren't exactly the most realistic of movie subjects.
Hacks get a hold of the idea and then make a big cheesy awful mess of it.
The first was Van Helsing themed and then they made up another character, Father Uffizi.
If you're an American voter that's already anti-bush then you may enjoy this but it has 0 entertainment value.
Moore says bring back the troops, kick out bush for a while to a cheering audience, it shows a random musical guest or celebrity then it shows a news caster talking about what the polls show to give a little time effect.
It's good for one watch, even for those who want it right away, and then to move on along as it's now four plus years gone anyway.
If you wish to see a David Lynch movie that is going to make you feel bad, angry, and all sorts of emotions then watch this one.
This film is a genuinely moving experience John hurt gives a performance more worthy of an academy award for best actor then any I can remember.
John Merricks endearing qualities mixed with the fact it is shot entirely in black and white, a taboo for modern day cinema other then low budget films caused me to have real tears in my eyes.
A must see film which will teach more about tolerance and understanding to people then any documentary or educational lesson.
Set in Victorian England, it looks into the Freak Show trade that was popular then, through one particular gentleman, grossly and uniquely deformed, by the name of John Merrick (The Elephant Man), and is based on the memoirs of the doctor played by Anthony Hopkins, Dr Frederick Treves.
Well done to Mel Brooks for producing such a beautiful film and having faith in the then relatively unheard of David Lynch.
I felt at first pity for John Merrick, but then my feelings changed to admiration, as the film went on.
If you like "Revenge" movies like "The Crow" or Death Wish" then you'll probably like this.
I agree with most of the comments already posted: it's a good Western, with Mexican Lancaster starting off as apparently almost servile in front of the Yankee Tanner, but then showing he's made of steel.
The black man, the Native American woman, the Mexicans, the Anglos, and then the rancher's not so faithful mistress, give this movie a lot of great subplots to think about, but the central story of Valdez first asking and then demanding money for the dead man's woman is simple yet effective as it draws out into chases and ambushes while revealing the characters for who they really are.
'Valdez is Coming' was the first, then 'The Lawman' (which i have not seen) and of course the mighty 'Ulzana's Raid'.
The man inside is killed by Lancaster and then it's discovered that the man was NOT the wanted man, but totally innocent.
I knew then that I would seldom see such a bold stroke; Lancaster shows what he is really made of when the glossy facade is dropped.
They refuse, of course, and, in the process of asking Tanner again, Valdez is cruelly treated: Tanner orders his men to tie a wooden cross to Valdez's back and then forces him to walk back to town Â some fifteen miles.
Add solid supporting roles by John Cypher, Susan Clark, and an offbeat ending, and you have a surprisingly engaging Western that delivers what we expect and then some.
This is a fantastic movie, driven primarily by Lancaster's embodiment of the character of Valdez - a town constable who kills an innocent man in self-defense, only to then become the subject of constant abuse by the slain's pursuer.
This movie did more to explain, use, and get characters out of, time travel paradoxes then anything I have ever seen on the screen.
His father hears it then, 30 years earlier.
They quickly do some things that shouldn't have happened back then, which then changes the future(or present).
But then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant (yes, milk) going to employ the workers.
then they realize that it's not only about them not getting their money, but about all those people who live off their paychecks.
I watched this movie really late last night and usually if it's late then I'm pretty forgiving of movies.
She is so "out there"--watch her eat an egg-salad sandwich and then try to picture one of today's actresses willing to look so natural and vulnerable.
I prefer watching it first, but if you want more mystery in the other films, watch them in their release order: Ringu, Ringu 2, then Ringu 0.
If you like Grand Theft Auto then this film is right up your alley.
Watching it, I did get a little bored after about 30 minutes, but then I did a gear change and accepted it for what it was - a low budget, romp through Auckland, with some cheesy action and acting.
- then here it be.
All I have to say is that I hope it comes out to the big screens soon, so I can see it again and again and then eventually buy it on DVD.
If you want to see it yourself, then just check the first few pages of the comment history in chronological order.
If you need further proof to see that this movie is purposefully over-rated, then you may want to check the message boards as well; you will see many post regarding how people are desperately looking to buy the DVD if only it were available nearby, or how you can buy it.
I saw Elizabeth, Danneel, and Clea in the audience and they all got along wonderfully and then saw Elizabeth and Jensen at Comic Con and they also seemed to be very close.
Set in a sandwich deli in Santa Cruz, the plot follows the lives of the off-beat employees as friendships are created and relationships are formed, damaged, then repaired.
All those glowing reviews and high marks and then you actually watch this turd and it's nothing like what the cast and crew reviews say it is.
Each scene ploddingly laid out, each emotional response labored and hollow, no interesting camera work to add any amount of impact, edited in a workman like fashion, nothing has any chance of lifting this movie apart from the slogans on Priestly t-shirts, and only then they provide a passing amusement.
The first act draws the viewer into a comedic whirlwind of wishful longing, then as the story spins into act two, the ax is dropped and the drama begins.
When it was over, I turned to the girl setting next to me, and we both agreed we wanted to see it again, right then and there!
If you are looking for a funny, touching, insightful, feel-good movie then Ten Inch Hero is for you.
I can't think of a better recommendation then that.
Judith Light is to be commended for her choice of projects; she is very good in the role of Alice, a single mother who is originally imprisoned for embezzlement, then sold out by her criminal defense lawyer; who,it turns out, made a crooked deal with a judge.
It grabs you from the start and then holds on when our stars jump over the real world divide.
But even then, she won't come to his defense.
If you're into Comedy-Horror movies then you shouldn't miss this gem.
Joan Blondell described Warners Bros. studio then as a place where things were "really cooking."
It's amazing how she was able to go from fragile heroine to hard-edged woman and then throw in a comedy.
It's amazing how she was able to go from fragile heroine to hard-edged woman and then throw in a comedy.
It starts out as a conflict between one Greek lad and another who both have unbegotton lust of a younger lad then themselves.
But, then again, the sequences are the problem.
It starts out as a conflict between one Greek lad and another who both have unbegotton lust of a younger lad then themselves.
Like reading Don Quixote, there are stories within the story and we lose our protagonists sometimes, but then they reappear to guide us to the next chapter within the art history book Fellini has created.
I imagine this film contains elements closer to real Roman life then Spartacus ever did(I know it's greek but whatever).
Back then, people's interests were about romantic novels about triangular love affairs.
Fearing the wrath of the worshipers they again travel abroad but soon find themselves in chains on a Roman slave ship which is then seized and boarded and finally they end up on an island where they are once again planning to embark on another adventure to search and rescue their lost slave-boy.
Encolpio and Ascilto then wander into the aristocratic home of a husband and wife who've just freed their slaves and committed suicide through bleeding themselves to death (a symbol of the death of aristocracy while the nouveau riche are getting fat?).
The film did drag here and there (certainly with Fellini letting some vignettes last longer than they should) but overall, the cumulative effect of all the stories creates a unique visceral experience that's seldom seen, back then or since.
If you enjoy true atmosphere in films, that creeping feeling of dread usually reserved for coming face to face with your own personal phobia, then watch this and prepare yourself- the final 15 minutes may well be the most heart-stoppingly chilling 15 minutes you will ever witness.
The film begins in modern day Japan- someone has heard a rumour about a videotape with a curse... then we flashback 30 years or so and meet the Evil Spirit Sadako...only to find she is a beautiful young woman, a talented actress though shy, and misunderstood.
Before then, I was only marginally interested in films.
And then I saw Satyricon.
And then it happened.
If you are not seduced by what you see then Button may bore you.
And I'd rather have a film try too hard then try too little.
Unfortunately, time and again a challenging idea or issue is raised and is then immediately dropped in favor of forced uplift or is simply glossed over completely.
Sadly, we are then given the usual pseudo-revelations involving doomed romance and familial ties.
The lovers experience a short idyll, a child is born, and then the narrative demands that Benjamin leave Daisy and go on a vision quest or something.
Like every other provocation in the film, the enormous human rights disaster that was Katrina is introduced and then shied away from.
would do to create some tension and then completely excuse him for it."
And if that is what you've been thinking after or during your viewing of this film, then this film has succeeded.
Mr. Button grabbed the baby from the room in front of some nurses and a doctor and then ran away from a cop.
If this movie made any effort to be realistic at all, Mr. Button would have feigned joy at the baby's birth and then dumped the baby after everyone had left.
He's come a long way as it is, and then comes along the curious "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button".
Y'just don't care about him at all... to be honest, the whole film struck me as a giant, drawn-out metaphor for a midlife crisis: a man pines after a girl who's not ready for him for years and years, then when she finally takes him into her bed, they spend a glorious year between the sheets, and as soon as responsibility shows up in the form of a child, he runs away from commitment, blaming his condition.
And then of course, when he comes back, she forgives him for being a coward and a stinker.
But if it were simply a matter of being Forest Gump, then I would still have high praise for Benjamin Button.
Sure, he looks like Brad Pitt in "Fight Club", "Se7en", "Thelma & Louise", but eventually he's going to look like Brad Pitt in "Cutting Class", and then Brad Pitt in seventh grade, and finally Brad Pitt as a toddler, and that's not so sexy.
I am going to go take a dump and get more entertainment in that ten minutes then I got in 108 minutes from that train wreck of a movie.
I give it a ten, but it deserves higher then that!
Lacey Chabert's accent sounds true, but then again she's originally from Purvis, Miss.
The humor of this is not what I prefer at the age of 38, but back then ...
Then as the movie goes on, you see Kent aka Flounder raiding the kitchen, and then you see Eric Stration!
Watch this movie, The Killer, and Bullet in the Head, and then cry when all the mediocre action movies and pale imitations you've been subjected to throughout the years get ruthlessly bitch-slapped across the room and forced to beg for forgiveness.
If your not a fan of subtitles then watch it for the action sequences and any conosseuir of all things violent would lap this up.
Hard Boiled-a top notch action film from Hong Kong must be hailed as a true role model for all action films.It is one of the best action films of its kind where speedy action mixes freely with dramatic sequences.This is something which creates a feeling in the minds of viewers that they are not being taken for granted as everything that is being depicted is serving some kind of purpose.One of most amazing things about John Woo's film "Lat sau san taam" is that its actions scenes are truly unbelievable.They have been filmed with such an accurate precision that they would easily put to shame some of the most accomplished artists whose every stroke is the result of immense patience and concise concentration.Hard Boiled is also a film with a bizarre twist as we get to see some hardworking cops mixing freely with hardened criminals.Although gang violence is a core issue of the film John Woo has not deceived fans of melodrama by showing how difficult it is to lead a life of a cop.The best part of this film comes in the form of John Woo appearing every now and then Ã  la Alfred Hitchcock.
The warehouse betrayal will be known for the bad guys on the motorcycles shooting at the other bad guys, and then, Tony, who is really an informant for the police, betrays his gun-runner boss.
And then that's when Tequila shows up and kicks a ton of @$$!
And also, I'll remember his character for his face-off with that bad guy with eye patch in the hospital (forgot his name), and then one scene, they realize there are a bunch of innocent patients and they BOTH choose to let them go so they could finish their fight.
If you're looking for a great foreign action film and if you're tired of watching too many Hollywood stuff, then "Hard Boiled" is the film for you.
Director John Woo has a powerful and explosive style that will leave you breathless after watching this extremely violent action flick.The camera is everywhere flying from place to place.And there are people everywhere.All of them firing a gun or two.I have never seen such energy before.The violence in "Hardboiled" is very brutal and well directed.The last half hour of this film,which take place in the hospital is full of inventive action sequences.Chow Yun-Fat is really good as a tough policeman and it's also very nice to see Anthony Wong("Bunman:Human Meat Pies","Dr Lamb","Bullet in the Head")-what a great performance!I like Hong Kong-action films by John Woo.Anyway, if you're tired of Hollywood's action trash,then this one is a must-see.Recommended!
If you're the average IMDB reader, you probably enjoy a good action movie every now and then, but you approach action films with a certain caution and skepticism (I can't blame you, even though I am an action junkie myself).
This is kind of a typical Buster Keaton story, except in reverse: the girl comes along earlier in the movie, the men are impressed with him earlier on, everything works out for him earlier on, and then the rest of the movie is him trying to maintain his luck versus trying to get the girl against all the forces of bad luck.
However, the copy I saw had obvious editing problems and may have been a rough-cut, but then again maybe not...  John Lennon once likened the madness around the Beatles mid-60's tours as like Fellini's Satyricon, well here it's certainly made flesh as we get a more candid than candid fly-on-the-wall insight into life on the road with the Rolling Stones around the time of their 1972 US tour.
But then i thought, actually no.
Some scenes are just bad, like the shot of what looks like Mick from the waist down, fondling himself, then you see Mick holding a camera, to supposedly make you wonder if that was Mick fondling himself.
And then, eventually, when she tells him she isn't a virgin, he is unable to cope with this and he breaks it off.
at first she works at a shoe store but then meets two girls that convince her to work in a strip bar and whiles there she has to deal with overzealous customers and lesbian co-worker that wants to perform the baby making process with her.
I've never been to a strip club before *cough* but if the girls there are as bleh as the ones in this BS movie then I'll just stick to watching my neighbors strip down thanks to the hidden camera I installed in her bathroom.
not to mention none of the girls made me horny even once, but then again it was pretty cold in the apartment when I was watching it.
1 Mixtape" You will then have a better understanding of what we actually endure.
The ending is telegraphed far in advance when the little boy shoots the assassin but just barely misses, the gun-hating mom picks up the gun and shoots him but just wounds him and then the macho sheriff takes it and does what only a man can do - justifiably kill a bad man with one shot.
He doesn't get many breaks, a psychopath, Dean Jagger, who hates him unrealistically, attempts to kill a ten-year old but succeeds only in killing his horse; when confronted by Anderson, he spews out his hate for the boy and the 'family' he springs from and then, equally unrealistically, agrees to back off and wait til the boy grows up for his revenge.
I think it's more of a psychological western in which Robert Mitchum works out his own salvation rather than get the help of a doctor like Ingrid Bergman who wouldn't have been available back then because Dr. Freud was just starting to develop his theories around the time this was made.
Pursued is a very decent picture, very nicely shot, darkly imaginative, and dripping with Noir style, but if it's actually a Noir film then that really is up for debate, as is, if this film really is a Western?
I cant remember if I watched 5 or 6 seasons,but I do remember that I thought the series was very funny for a while,but then it became a little more confusing and darker (I liked the first computer best),I don't know if its just me but I felt it was almost depressing watching the later seasons.
The only survivors, were 'Dave Lister', played by the enigmatic and downright hilarious 'Craig Charles' (now appearing as Loyd Mullaney in Coronation Street), who had just been placed in stasis for smuggling aboard his female cat (Frankenstein), who then turned out to be the only other survivor.
From then on, they spend their times together, while Holly steers them all home, back to Earth.
And then, later on, she was replaced by ChloÃ« Annett, a completely different type.
The movie "Suddenly is more then just a solid thriller as well as a curiosity piece.
The way the assassination is depicted planned and put into motion is far more realistic and believable then what the Warran Commission come up with.
Only the psycho and insecure Barnon thinks that he can pull this off, even after Benny is shot dead by the Suddenly police, as he cased out the train station less then an hour before the president's train was to arrive.
Being on an ego trip more then anything else Baron, despite the police already being tipped off, is determined to get the job done and in the end does a job not only on his co-hit-men but on himself.
I was hopeful after the first episode as that was quite good although still a little overdone with that annoying cinema effect they used but then in the next few episodes, Rimmer left and they brought Kochanski into the show.
There's also a talking computer called 'Holly', played first by Norman Lovett and then Hattie Hayridge.
The same episode brought in as a regular 'Kryten' ( David Ross, then Robert Llewelyn ), a robot who speaks in a Canadian accent and who by his own admission looks like Herman Munster's stunt double.
I saw some of the episodes aired on a public TV station and then nothing for years.
Rob Grant and Doug Naylor (thus the nom de plume: Grant Naylor) wrote the first 6 series and then split up.
But try watching episodes from series 3, then watch series 8 and you'll realise how much the show went into freefall.
Markie Post is reliving nightmares as well and then it comes to her that she also was abducted and probed by these evil space aliens.
They then realize a common thread regarding the abductions and join forces to stop them once and for all.
Katie also got very bright during her sleep-walking disappearances knowing more about politics in getting her dad Bryan ,Stephen McHattie, who's running for city councilman elected then his entire election staff put together.
Hard to follow at first with a lot of sub-plots that it really could do without but when "Visitors of the Night" gets to the core or "Heart and Soul" of it's story it's very hard not to keep your tear-ducts from filling up and then spilling over.
You choose what movies to watch, stick with the genre you like, then you will not be disappointed so often.
I like when I'm not expecting anything pleasurable or funny in a movie and then they come with this.
The main reason is that as long as a movie delivers something that I really enjoy, then I don't rank after critical review, but through share enjoyment.
Simply because it probably didn't overdo it, like a uncertain pleader who would try to hard to convince it with fancy words and show, rather then solid statements.
This bears no relation to the finished product, which is so beautiful as to be jaw-dropping, and then some.
If you like all the genres that I listed...then you MUST see this movie!
Yes, it IS Alien vs. Highlander... and if you don't think that sounds awesome, well then you're missing out.
If you like 13th Warrior or AVP type movies then this'll do for you.
This is a nifty, no nonsense thriller that starts out almost like Thelma & Louise and then veers sharply into darker territory.
It's a pretty clever story with the device of showing the actions of a certain character, then showing a clock moving backwards and showing the actions of another character leading up to the same point.
The film is really slow and poorly acted until Sinatra shows up about 20 minutes in but then becomes MUCH better.
If anyone out there knows of any other good films about early exploration of the New World then e-mail me.
However, if you are NOT familiar with the play or history (which, by the way, is a lot different than the way Shakespeare portrayed it), then watch this AFTER you read the Cliff Notes--or better yet, see the TV series BLACK ADDER I!
It is interesting then how the film establishes Porky's character as sentimentally attached to his old train, but not anti-technology at all: for him, machines have precedence over animals.
I saw this film when it came out in 1984, and since then, have been unable to forget it.
These silly kids, as someone else said, then throw tantrums at the slightest problem, so clearly they are not mature enough to handle such setbacks and probably haven't done enough in their lives to justify having such expense and attention being showered on them.
Did i mention how Fake and cheesy she seemed.Its like they like being on TV so they have to be swearing all the time at their parents and burning then down to ashes with these creepy yet hilarious stares.
Someone on the show even said that their parents spent more on their party then on the parents wedding!
These are people who are annoying beyond belief, because if something doesn't go their way, such as their favourite celebrity won't be showing up because he/she had other plans (like WORKING), or the fact that the parents won't let them buy the $300 dress that makes them look like a whore, then they bitch, whine and moan until they get their way.
It catches your interest for a couple minutes and then you realize just how utterly tragic it is and you have to stop watching.
The acting is OK (not more then that) i give it 3/10, BUT IT IS FUN WATCHING THE SHARK !!
What about the sheer excess of stock footage, then (with the shark changing dimension and look from one scene to the next)?
It's ironic, then, that this movie was itself ripped off by the makers of both JAWS 3-D (1983) and JAWS: THE REVENGE (1987), the vastly inferior concluding episodes in the Universal saga: as in the latter, the shark is depicted as an intelligent animal (such as when it systematically pursues the entire line-up of surfers without killing them only to then vent its anger on the man leading them in a boat and, again, when it tries to bury our two heroes inside a cave by crashing repeatedly into a rock-face and barring its exit with the falling stones!
It still would have been a rip-off, but the point is the movie starts out on a cheesy but fun level, and then disintegrates into a travesty.
We will see the mechanical shark (which is a pretty poor effect) rise above the water and then sink down.
The acting is OK (not more then that) i give it 3/10, BUT IT IS FUN WATCHING THE SHARK !!
If you've seen any Italian exploitation pictures from the 70s or 80s, then just imagine one of the worst ones you've seen, such as Lamberto Bava's "Monster Shark" or Joe D'Amato's "Killing Birds".
The daughter straps him down and administers high electric voltage through his forehead, while the mother rides his convulsing pelvis and then proceeds to cool him down with a golden shower.
If you're simply interested in seeing some of the most extreme S&M stuff ever put on cinema, then by all means see it.
However, if you're looking for a little bit more than that, then you might be left wondering "what was the point of all this?"
Thus they force food in, and then regurgitate that food back up.
Although there's much nastiness and depravity on show (from Thanassoulis being tied down and given electro-shock treatments before Herold urinates on his face, to Valley raping him and then vomiting on his face, to the denouement where Thanassoulis kills Valley with a knife he has strapped on like a dildo), the film never really feels nasty and sick.
We then follow the daughter as she details the things her and her mother get up to, before the weary detective; who is given the name 'Singapore Sling', stumbles into the pair's home and ends up becoming 'involved' in more insane games.
The duo then hold the injured Singapore hostage in their home, while pretty much just trying to make him go nuts.
A mother and a daughter live in a large home,playing games of sexual domination and re-enacting the murders of various servants that they have hired and then killed.A private detective called Singapore Sling comes searching for Laura,a woman he is fixated on but whom they have killed.They imprison him,using poor guy as a sex toy and torturing him.
"Singapore Sling" is shot in exquisite black-and-white and classical music plays on the soundtrack and this makes it even more unsettling.In one truly demented scene the male lead is tied down to the bed, ETC paddles jammed against his forehead and he is left convulsing in shock while the mother rides him and then moves up to urinate on his face.So if you are a fan of twisted cinema like "Visitor Q","Salo" or "Sweet Movie" give this gross-out masterpiece a look.10 out of 10.
They eventually let the girls go, who then stumble upon a group of killer hippies who rape them some more.
They rape the girls repeatedly in the middle of nowhere until finally letting them go, where the girls then meet other crazies who rape them too.
For instance, one (named "Crabs" I think) keeps scratching his groin, then complains to another that he got that itch after he let the other guy "suck" him.
I remeber my brother playing this nonstop on our Original Nintendo and then we sold it... 5 years later we got it on our computer and I played it for awhile.
If you enjoy those artistic movie where the scenery and slow pace are important too then I think this movie will be very enjoyable to you.
Imagine the perfectionist forms Kurosawa had achieved with samurai epics, Ford and Lean with lyrical, volatile nature, Tarkosvky and Bresson with the spiritual-bound outer space or dinky office desks of priests and cops, then add a too-generous wallop of Clouzot's suffocating suspense flooding from the dark recess of human nature - and King Hu's universe of the Wuxia STILL has plenty of its own identity left!
If you are looking for lots of action and the kind of over-the-top antics we expect from Hong Kong, then don't look here.
If you want to see stunning scenery, a languid but atmospheric pace, and beautiful images such as the sun rising over the silhouettes of Buddhist monks, then enjoy.
He calls on Buddha and the powers of the universe and the henchmen destroys his sons and then him self.
The story that begins as a ghost story starts slowly but rewardingly layering up, developing and getting more dimensions, moving into Wu Xia styled action and politics drama, then leaping into the territory of Seven samurais -style tactical warfare depiction, finally getting some deeply mystical aspects in the end.
No thanks, then by magic it came up on digital TV in the UK, 3 months after I had started to look for it!
I first saw 'A Touch of Zen' in the late 70s; it had such an effect on me that I looked for it on video for years and years, but to no avail - then to my relief it was shown on TV during a martial arts night twenty years later.
If anybody is not convinced by the merit of the martial arts genre and just wants to give it a sole and unique chance, then this is the movie that might convinced such a snob that cinematographic 'art' is not necessarily grey, quiet and slow, but can be colourful, vibrant and full of pathos.
A man who witnesses his brother plowing his wife, takes him out driving in order to kill him, with the help of some random psycho wearing only a loincloth, whom the cuckolded brother then kills off.
So she leaves him though she knows she is still in love with him, and then her world shatters when she hears he is dead.
But by then the fictional and real worlds will get united, by the time Lucia and Lorenzo come together at the end, the two parallel lives of Lorenzo have become one.
If you get bored of massing and destroying your friends in a 1on1 or crashing the computers party in a 2 on 2 compstomp, then all you need is to select 'Use Map Settings'.
If you like StarCraft, then I suggest getting the expansion (Brood War).
Thus, the events from Act I (Terrans) are then referred to from the other side in Act II (Zerg) and are acted upon.
But then : I like Cube, and that had similar problems.
Then the actual story started, and from then on it went downward.
The first time I saw Richards was in the 1997 sci/fi epic "Starship Troopers" and since then she has appeared in "Wild Things", "Drop Dead Gorgeous", and the recent James Bond film "The World Is Not Enough".
Since then, he has appeared in "Pleasantville", "Varsity Blues", "She's All That", and most recently, "The Skulls".
The filmmakers should have stuck with the love story then they might have had a good movie on their hands.
It shows a T-rex make a phone call, then check the pay phone for change after he's done, then it shows him crying with tears pouring from his eyes.
If you can't appreciate this movie for what it is, then you shouldn't be reviewing B-movies.
I expected to watch it for maybe five minutes and then get bored and turn to something else.
And then I loved it!
All are the reflections of the then Japanese society.
He hesitates, then crushes it with his shoe, his pride intact.
I think if a person doesn't like this film then he has no idea what poverty is.
Today, out of context, it seems corny, but back then in 1947, if you had just ducked into a dark movie theatre and spent your 5 or 10 or however many yen for a few hours escape on a Sunday afternoon with your girlfriend, it has a different meaning.
If you want to see a movie with sex and a plot, then keep looking.
I can't see both views being given equal weight in biology classes because, if Darwinian evolution is "only a theory," as the ID people argue, then Intelligent Design hasn't yet cleared even that bar.
If it helps you get through life, then I am all for it.
Rumors then spread throughout the Jewish ghetto and soon everyone believes he has a radio, so he decides to make up news in order to give them some sense of hope in this holocaust.
Jakob, then carries on the lie,and later is forced to carry on the lie, that he has a radio, to keep the hope alive, in the end dies , but doesn;t let go , just so that people already close to death under the Nazis, don't lose whatever hope that is left.
Horrible things happened back then and now there are movies to show us it all.This is a movie about hope.Hope is still there in the dramatic ending.Hope is seen through the tears.Isn't that, hope, all we need in the end?
What he has to do, then, is walk the fine line between delivering lots of fictitious good news to the whole ghetto without letting the Nazis find out about it.
The way I see it, as long as a movie takes the holocaust seriously then it should not be criticized for being a holocaust film that's not in the right format or that had an actor who has done too many comedy roles.
We can then examine these foibles and learn from them.
I was only about 13 when I saw it and have never been able to view it since then.
Until then there is only the LP.
Definitely plays better as a musical then the dance/musical of Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse (although that version would have been great, too, if they didn't film it on a set.
I almost thought that I had dreamed it, but then I would look at the album cover and KNOW i was right!
If you don't mind seeing some, you may say, awkward sex scenes, and you're looking for a really great plot, with great dialogs full of symbolisms, and also excellent photography, then you're just gonna love this one.
Periodically, guess how much time has elapsed, then glance at the clock and see how accurate your estimation was.
It's unfortunate then that the film is written in such a way that whenever something big needs to happen, reality gets thrown out of the window.
If it wasn't for the slightly desperate final 20 minutes then this could've been a contender for one of the best films I've watched this year.
Unfortunately this movie spends 100 minutes as a police thriller then turns into a cheesy slasher movie in the last 20.
"I'm going to kill them now (babysitter and her porn-star mother)" Lorenzo says as he arises from bed, then over to his computer where he starts writing.
Well, they get into a slap fight with their first customers, then decide to try selling mousetraps to the local cheese factory.
So anyway, if you are a Laurel and Hardy fan like I am, then I recommend Swiss Miss!
Everything about this movie screams class--from the sight gags to the outrageous costumes (which if you really look at the costumes and sets they probably cost a fortune in Depression money) Laurel and Hardy are great for the whole movie with some of the goofiest antics I've seen in any of their films (selling mouse traps: they drill holes in the floor so the mice can get in and then cap them with golf balls so they can't get back out) The gorilla in Switzerland is hilarious (and really random) but makes me laugh every time.
They are then forced to work as slaves in the hotel to pay off an enormous food bill.
No, this isn't exactly Tarkovsky, but then it isn't meant to be.
I am so glad DAVE started playing these as i had only seen the US version and clips on youtube until then.
I would have liked a bit more conversation about his Stateside Filmirage productions (not a single question about TROLL 2; granted it wasn't the cult film then it was now).
If profanity and tasteless, unfunny dirty jokes make you laugh, then you'll probably enjoy this.
But if you're an "old-fashioned" type, then don't bother.
If you like it raw and fresh then check out this comic masterwork by a legend and icon among his peers.
It doesn't make this the most accessible movie but then again, you don't ever have to watch an European movie for its accessibility.
You think of how funny his albums are and then here you see him do the physical aspect of his routine.
YEs the story is FLAWED......... i hated the ending............ anyways.... Sakkena- SOnam Kapoor wasn't really impressive........... she tried..........but she convinced me that she was crazy... and thats the only reason why i liked the movie.... Ranbir kappor is GOOD, not great but surely he will get BETTER...soon.... as for RANI she is never BAD.... Sanjay leela Bhansali made a beautiful looking movie... not necessarily a great movie.... but if u watch it with it with Open minds then maybe u will LOVE it.... or lets say Be able too see something more meaningful in the rather Simple Ending????
raised in certain parts of this film and for the purpose of those reading I shall not include any spoilers within my review but if we look away from these things then all in all Saawariya is an average movie.
And then leave with Salman after he returns.
I was really excited about Saawariya when I first heard about it, but then my enthusiasm waned when I saw the promos for OSO.
This film is for people who are looking for something different in a bollywood movie.If you are one of those who want to experience something new and exciting and different, then do watch this film.
If you have been in love then after watching this movie you will easily say that this movie is a "Fairy Love Tale".
It is indeed a totally new way of making a movie and for me it strengthen the believe that if some one can bring Oscar to Sub Continent then it has to be SLB's art of perfection...
He asks her why she is crying, then she says that she is waiting for her lover, Imaan (Salman Khan), who has been gone to some 'country'.
The movie then takes you in a steady journey of Raj meeting Sakina and how they found or lose their love.
In a showdown that everyone knows has to happen between the two hitmen you choose who you liked throughout the entire film and then see who comes out on top.
If u are bored and looking for a thriller or a action movie then rent this movie.
Even then, Fulltime Killer was pretty memorable for me.
Great action - not a Michael Bay action fest but enough to keep you interested and then some.
And then there's the subconscious, which cannot differentiate between fantasy and reality.
But then I saw Shaolin Soccer, and that shook my disturbed belief a bit.
When you've seen all the classics by John Woo then movies like this are where you should continue.
The International Community then endorsed a Dictatorship which was in turn crushed in 1979 by a Shia Muslim Revolution.
I find this film to be for mun then the real thing.
It is in my opinion the best of the four games, and then I think the three predecessors to this one were great too.
This is a wonderful film - expertly voiced over by Billy Crystal, Gilda Radner and Harry Shearer (of Spinal Tap / Simpsons fame) - full of humour and genuine affection towards sports, animals and animation (which is top quality throughout it should be noted) and as i mentioned before the songs are great - perhaps a bit dated now with the late 70s/early 80s production, but then a great tune never fails to touch you somehow, no matter how it is presented.
Our family found it a favorite when it first came out - and now that I am retired I still enjoy having a laugh at it now and then.
I saw it in 87 and loathed it then, and I'm absolutely sure that it is just as bad now.
I remember watching this movie as a kid and sorta liking it but then again I was 10.
Oddly enough, he's then raised by wolves who for go any natural instinct to eat him and instead decide, collectively to raise him as their own.
There then comes a extremely boring section where we see this researcher trying to educate Bobo.
At one point, he's a bumbling idiot, the next moment he's arguing a case in court and then he's back again to being the idiot.
If you don't then just remember..."We all see things through different eyez right???"
Its all about a baby boy, nicknamed Bobo, that has been banished by his older brotherinto the wilderness and then gets raised by wolves.28 years later a scientist goes into the woods to study a pack of wolves until she stumble upon the human wolf.
If you enjoy this increasingly lackluster genre, then perhaps this film is for you.
Check out the female scientist who gets attacked by the plastic spider and is screaming as it sprays its web onto her face, and then she runs out the door, only to find herself pulling herself along the floor as the shadow of the spider comes closer... scene cuts to a fade out with a long scream(!!!).
The movie starts off with three nerds who decides to sneak into nowhere for some reason, and then a space craft hits the ground (when I say space craft, I mean a cheap 99p rocket bought from the Early Learning Centre) and they see a mutated crew member who was impregnated with a spider, which was mutated by, yes, you guessed it.
Then, they fly over the city and an anti-climax follows where the spider gets blown up and then the film immediately finishes when everyone goes "yay".
If this can get made, then the studios are going to be snapping up ours.
you cauld say a lot of bad things about this film but then you are missing the point.
so if you like big B movies then watch this.
If you the the cast in the film, Monsters, Giant Animal films, Horror, Thrillers, Mystery, and interesting films then I recommend you to see this film today!
Problem is, no one would've had the patience to stay up until then.
But, then again, I've definitely seen a lot worse.
If you love cheesy sci-fi featuring over-sized monsters on the rampage, then you should have a great time with this one.
A girl who might be a truly hot babe and has a thing for UFO's drags her two boy-toys to a secret government lab where she gets her glasses knocked off by a mutant spider and becomes a truly hot babe after which she waists no time getting the spider to off her two boy-toys then she does a wet t-shirt dance and wins the heart of a hunka hunka burning MIB(Man In Black).
No, it's nothing ground breakingly original, but then it never pretends to be for one minute.
i am so pleased i bought this movie at first i thought oh dear lets hope the film is more original then the title and to my surprise it was.
contains spoilers the govenment is carrying out experiments on a spider and injecting it with alien DNA but when a sola flare hits the space craft were the experiment is taking place the spider escapes and begins to kill of the crew one by one then laying egges in a surviver with boldging bodyparts the special effects really get going when the spider comes out of the hosts mouth and begins to attack anyone in its path including three nosey college newspaper reporters the spider is finaly killed but not before laying egges in its creater ( some phsyco messed up bloke) who when the students get out of the lab underground find there boss dead and the phsyco bloke sitting in there seat then the spider is born.
the spider then gets into the city ( with amazing real special effects) reaking horror werever it goes.
If you are in a humourless mood looking for some horror, then this movie will probably only make you angry.
I've only seen it one more time since then, and that's not nearly enough.
A heartwarming story about a young woman, her daughter, her boyfriend (then husband)...and her battle with cancer.
Christina Raines plays a young woman who is diagnosed with cancer, and rather then choosing to live her life handicapped, she chooses to live the rest of her life to the fullest.
Sadly, several years later, a close friend of ours, Kathy, then lived the story, so similar it is haunting, she died in 1979.
I have only seen it repeated once since then,and that was several years ago while living here (in New York).
After seeing the movie I was inspired to try to find out about the real Lyn and her family (we didn't have the internet then): I found out from the library that there was a trust established for her daughter Jennifer, and I sent them a donation but never heard back from them.
We saw a virtual out and out farce in one episode with a couple of the guys taking an expensive recovered auto for a brief cruise; only to have it come up missing and then clearing up the whole mess.
Two British film makers traveled to 25 countries recording pieces of music and then fusing them together via laptop, and the results are a stunning fusion of world musics and editing.
But then to me (to paraphrase the opening of the Conan Doyle Holmes story "A Scandal in Bohemia") Basil Rathbone (who looked uncannily like the Sidney Paget illustrations for the original Holmes stories and did both the cerebral and the active sides of the character consummately well) will always be THE Sherlock Holmes.
This additional perspective can then be added to the innumerable other perspectives that a person has accumulated and which ultimately serve to expand his or her consciousness.
And then at the end when you find out that the movie is actually based on one real incidence, your reaction is just WHAAATTTT?
A German-Indonesian co-production in which the actors speak whatever language suited them, and then all the voices were badly dubbed at the end.
Although he then went on to act in movies like Tridev, which would undoubtedly fall into the 'glamour'/'mainstream' cinema, he is still considered to be one of the best actors ever in Indian cinema.
It is an amazing experience, made all the more powerful when you realize how ALIVE Freddie was back then.
But then again, I like movies that knowingly play with cliches of the genre, or genres in this case.
They then checked I could drive, and I was told to drive the jeep at about 70kph up a hill outside Bogor.
I often wondered what happened to the film, and then one day found it accidentally browsing this site.
You don't believe me, then think back to such horrid films as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA, ZOMBIES ON Broadway, GHOSTS ON THE LOOSE (with the East Side Kids) and MURDER BY TELEVISION!!!
This from a rival communication bigwig Donald Jordan, Charles K. French, and then going to work for him.
Seems like this guy couldn't have anything more to do with the Kung Fu Movie scene and then i find about 10 more DVDs.
If you like Jackie Chan then this is a must see movie.
So why then are the results as mixed as I think they are.
But if you want to see Humphrey Bogart in a truly charismatic, well-written role, then rent "Casablanca."
And if you want a truly well-realized courtroom drama, then set your sights on "Anatomy of a Murder" (1959) and/or "12 Angry Men" (1957).
After 3 escaped convicts rape her, steal her three nubile daughters and then flee, leaving her strung up by her hands, she of course wants revenge.
The film focuses a little more on Matt Murdock and his alter ego Daredevil then David Banner and the Hulk manly because this film was going to start the Daredevil TV show.
The film sees David Banner moving from another place again and heads to New York for a place to stay while trying to find a way to stop the transformations, meanwhile a diamond heist is done and two of the thieves go on a train with Banner on, one of them decides to rape the young women on the train and after attacking Daivd he changes and attacks them both then runs off and changes to Banner but the police find him and arrest him thinking he did it.
Matt then goes to Ellie and talks to her and she lies to him then he leaves.
Wilson Fisk then comes up with a plan to kidnap Ellie to lure Daredevil then ambush him and defeat him.
David Banner meets the Captain who tells him what's going on then he goes into his cell again.
Ellie is soon kidnapped by one of the Kingpin's men, Matt then tells David that he needs to go to trial but after a nightmare of what could happen David changes into the Hulk and escapes.
Daredevil then finds David's apartment and asks him to come with him at first he doesn't want to but Daredevil shows him who he really is and they go to his house where he explains to him how he became blind and how he can see sound like a radar.
He then asks David to help him find Elley and stop Wilsom Fisk, he's given a possible location by the Captain and goes their where he finds Ellie but also gets ambushed by Kingpin's men and gets beaten up buy suddenly David changes into the Hulk and beats them, then Daredevil sees what happens to David.
How's this for a really inspired and effective handy-dandy sci-fi/horror combo premise: Let's take your basic randomly selected motley assortment of everyday folks gathered together in a deep, isolated, self-contained underground nuclear fall-out shelter so they can survive an impending end-of-the-world holocaust tale and embellish on this standard situation with a borrowing from the then hip killer-animals-run-amuck trend by having a horde of vicious, relentless, chattering vampire bats with a taste for human blood attack the understandably terrified bunch at regular bloodcurdling intervals.
i would love to watch this movie again, just to see if it has the same effect now as it did then.
If you appreciate a movie about interesting characters in everyday situations, then this is a movie for you.
I've had guests who stared at the programme with a blank stupefaction and then turn to me as if in belated discovery that I were deranged.
But i can safely say that nothing has made my jaw drop in sheer wonderment in the way Vic & Bob did back then.
Inside the lion's den, Robin first provokes the lion and then makes his escape relying on nothing but his instincts!
In her disdain for the arrogant-and-obnoxious Sir Guy (Rathbone), we discern her personal ethics, for soon afterwards she is first provoked by then falls for the arrogant-yet-charismatic Robin, who `loves a man who can best (him)'-the antithesis of Sir Guy.
It then moves to Canada where a porn actor (Shawn Ashmore) steals blood from his father to hide his infection.
She hires a US$ 2,000,000.00 life insurance; then she infects herself and sells and cashes part of her insurance in advance to have a comfortable life with her son.
I found it a bit confusing to begin with some African scenes and then jump to the China story.
Robin falls in love with Maid Marian , right then and there.
I saw this movie when it was first released, and then again last week on video.
There is worst to come;the entirely intrusive and impossible to listen to score destroys the very things you expect from a Gary Daniels movie,namely the action.His two long and protracted fight scenes include some good techniques as you would expect from Gary but unfortunately look like they were filmed by a blind cameraman suffering from Parkinson's disease.In any case they are ruined by that God awful music which even drowns out the fight sound effects and you have to ask yourself if any of the technical team working on BLACK FRIDAY had even so much as seen a movie before let alone worked on one.I have watched many of Gary's movies several times in the past(BLOODMOON,RIOT,RECOIL)but could never envisage watching this catastrophe again.If you can imagine what the worst episode of "Miami Vice" would have been like if performed by the most inept actors and crew money could buy then that gives you some idea of how bad BLACK FRIDAY IS.I have some advice for director Darren Doane and that is..in future Darren,don't!
And then we see Gary Daniels fight this chunky guy.The camera poorly shows them fight like almost the whole time we only saw a part of their body's plus the camera was sideways and nearly upside-down.
This is a movie I switched onto by accident,and then really enjoyed it.OK so the storyline was predictable and provided an excuse for the viewers to feel sad and shed a few tears.It is one of those movies that has no violence or sex and can be enjoyed by the whole family.Maybe I am too sentimental but I gave it 9/10.
Predictably, the players hate her at first, then they start to like her and at the same time the team starts off losing before they finish up winning.
First the coach and the players must face humiliating defeat, then gradually get better and then of course win the big game.
Mykelti Williamson also became well known, first in Midnight Caller and then as the shrimp connoisseur Bubba in Forrest Gump.
Funny that the mental processes of advertising executives was as unfathomable then as it is now.
How about that "stop the car, kiss, and then start driving again" thing with Frances and Bob?
We are shown the daughter getting an address for Bisset, but we are not shown what she does from then on in her search.
If you really want to watch a Speedy Gonzales cartoon then check out CAT-TAILS FOR TWO or MEXICALI SHMOES.
If you are easily offended by racial stereotypes then I would avoid this cartoon - actually all Speedy Gonzales cartoons for that matter.
I don't know how many times I've seen it since then, but it always gives my heart a lift and I leave the theatre (it must be seen on a large screen)with a happy face.
The point was made 1 minute into the movie, and then repeated in different words from other people and shows, movies, etc.
We start out with some talking heads pontificating about what the word means to them, then there's a childish montage of people dropping the f-bomb, then a bunch of people spouting the (untrue) theory that the word is an acronym for "Fornication Under Consent of the King" (actually, it comes from an old Dutch word for "penis").
I can talk mostly then about how the filmmakers go around the use of the word f*ck.
Basically, a creature is going on the attack fusing itself a bit with those it kills and then you have your characters that are your normal rag tag group including a couple with hidden agendas.
Like Aliens series...then watch this!
She then sees a documentary that includes a shot of the house in her dreams.
The director seems to have taken the scripts from every other done to death horror in this particular type (old house, child, etc, etc) and then kind of mashed it all together hoping for the best and coming up with the worst.
What would another have done under those circumstances, a life filled with memories and dreams and then to face and even embrace those fears in the search for the truth and to save that little girl.
Are her nightmares really lost memories of a past she has forgotten, and if she is the little girl ghost then how is that possible?
If you want to see a half decent film of this type check out something like "Skeleton Key"... and if anyone thought that was bad (which I didn't, but I know it has its critics) then woo... really don't go and see 'The Marsh'!
No horror movie can hold a candle to the violence of a silicone implant the size of a throw pillow being yarded through a gaping hole in a women's breast, then replaced with another only marginally smaller implant.
It starts out with Vitelli as some homeless punk, but then he gets sucked into a secret assassin school and it turns out that he is some kind of genius.
so he tries to get kicked out and then tries to escape.
Even then the quality, the characters and even the music stuck with me (it has one of the most perfect scores ever composed!).
If you have never seen "The Adventures of Robin Hood" then do so as soon as you can, show it to your kids and, if possible, see it on the big screen.
That's what I mean by subtle, you almost miss it and then you can't explain to yourself what it is that is so incredibly funny about what he's doing.
And then, as if he hadn't been punished enough already, McGonigle must listen to Mrs. Pepperday's spirited rendition of "The Sea Shell Song."
These two sequences alone are reason enough to make this movie a must-see comedy classic, and, interestingly, in each of them Fields himself plays victimized straight man: first to Baby LeRoy, then to Jan Duggan, whose rendition of the song is a show-stopping triumph.
Apparently the savior of the project was an unheralded screenwriter named Jack Cunningham, then known primarily for his earlier work on Westerns such as THE COVERED WAGON and a couple of Douglas Fairbanks vehicles.
If this background information is correct then viewers owe a debt of thanks to Mr. Cunningham for his important contribution to this terrifically entertaining, funny, and nostalgic slice of theatrical Americana.
This movie makes light of some of those old fashioned sexist ideas,(domestic violence, man/wife roles) so may offend some, but then it was made for a different time.
And so poor "Toad" has to travel on an auto-rickshaw, then by the local train (which he was trying to board with all the western civility, brandishing his ticket, but has to come down to the Indian method of jumping randomly into any compartment when he sees that there is no space), and then over the potholed and cow-filled roads of the real India.
Her errands-man then demonstrates to a shocked "Toad" why eating with the left hand is unclean in a scene which had me rolling in laughter.
The social outcast Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men,despite lacking the comforts of home and titles, save a then feudal England from the corruption of the Sheriff of Nottingham and the usurper Prince John.
If this does not receive wider distribution especially in the US then someone is seriously asleep at the wheel.
It would be fantastic to work on spreading it by independent unconventional means then track its success: are we about to witness a new revolution in cinema marketing?
I can dream on but then, myself neither Indian nor American, I cannot see how one must be either to absolutely enjoy this excellent piece of work.
This isn't as good of a film as Boys Town, but then most sequels don't live up to the original.
Interestingly, three actors - Rathbone, Eugene Palette and Montagu Love - would go on to co-star together again in another equally renowned swashbuckler, THE MARK OF ZORRO (1940; which I also just rewatched): Love, then, can be seen as well in yet one more similar film - the definitive 1937 version of THE PRISONER OF ZENDA (which is forthcoming on DVD from Warners as part of a "Literary Classics Collection" and coupled with its inferior 1952 scene-for-scene remake); incidentally, all of these classics virtually constitute the three top titles in the entire swashbuckling genre!
They only went out on one real date that the viewers saw and one implied date; and then Clark pops the question?
I think the writers perhaps identified that they made a mistake killing him off at the end of the first season as from then on Superman had no full-time enemy which in the long-run cost the quality of episodes.
It would have made excellent viewing watching Luthor escape and then having to build his empire again from nothing.
I thought it was funny then.
Unfortunately it stayed back then.
I watched it because I liked Dean Cameron in an old TV show and was curious to see what he had done since then.
If you want a really good laugh then watch the original Ski School.
It had its funny moments, but then again, it also had some parts where the sense-of-humor had me wincing in pain.
In the Royal Rumble, two men start and are then joined at regular intervals by additional wrestlers.
Henry has been annoying people since he returned to WWE last autumn, inflicting a genuine injury on then champion Batista (which led him to relinquishing his belt).
And then the last match of the night.
Angle wins after a chairshot on the head of Mark Henry then an Angle Slam.
9/10 Quite a surprise to see this match 3rd on the card but at then end of the show it became clear why.
It was a great rumble match as usual, a bit better then last year, mostly because i was so shocked Mysterio won, even though there were rumours he would, i didn't believe it, then when he was left with Orton i was sure Orton would win, but it was Rey!
If you want to know and learn about grind-house movies, then this is a good place to start.
However, this is no triumph of style over substance: Raymond gently unfurls his tale, Mary at first still as she receives the message, her agitation growing as she takes the call from Simon and realises he is on the brink of killing himself, and then her flight into the night as she attempts to lay her own ghosts to rest by saving another, all leading to a taught and chilling climax.
If high-minded concepts mixed with visual flair is your bag, then you'll enjoy this latter-day "Twilight Zone" episode.
The atmosphere and slightly unconventional plot coupled with superb acting, directing, and script "writing" has allowed me to watch the movie more then twice with no disappointment Mr. Duvall is at his finest and I wait to see his beautiful co-star in another production.
After reading it you see that if he wasn't born to play these types of roles then he certainly spent his life practicing for them.
The beginning was pretty much what i expected but then the tango was introduced along with the beautiful dancing of Luciana Pedraza.
It was then that the movie made a turn and the wonderful tango dancing became the high point of the film.
The film's one redeeming grace are the artful dance sequences, but then you can just watch a song & dance film if that's what you're after.
If you are looking for action but are sick of the wooden black and white characters we get from Hollywood then this film is for you.
Besides the tricks for a Disney movie, the "last minute efforts", the stupidest guards on earth etc, I suspect the KGB didn't run the country or kill more than 20 million people and could have not realized that, for instance, once Marie first gave sure signs of "dissidence" and then did what she did (Sasha), she wasn't going to try more mischief.
So Sasha's story, from his swimming talents (like a bad Hollywood movie), the state official realizing his family had all been traitors and him being let free to wander in the country, then his standing at the French Embassy like if somebody in his condition could really barter for anything (there were millions of people in the same condition).
But then, when I was watching the movie, all events seemed so realistic.
The cathartic nature of this film was such that found myself unable even to cry until the credits began their long slow march across the screen, and even then getting up out of my seat was not an option.
If God really does judge us on things we do on this Earth, well then Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are going straight to hell!
they make a city like new-york, who's larger then life, like it's the smallest city with just 10 people.
If they removed that scene from the movie, or at least took out the wardrobe changes and dancing, then it would be better.
I mean, it wasn't BAD, it started out well but then it just bored me to wherever.
At first I groaned but then to my surprise I found myself getting caught up in it!
At first I groaned but then to my surprise I found myself getting caught up in it!
If you want to see this film online, go to Google and type in "MÃ©liÃ¨s" and then click the video button for a long list of his films that are viewable without special software.
Meanwhile, the truancy officer commandeers and subsequently wrecks a tourist couple's RV to chase down Roxy, but then gets promoted for busting the pirated music ring.
I saw this film at the New York festival last June and was impressed by the intensity of the narrative: with a small cast and a small budget Ms. Sinclair draws the viewer in and never lets you rest as the heroine has her life destroyed and then is thrust in a circumstance where she has to confront the monster who has made her life a living hell.
But then I was pleasantly surprised that it turned out to be a moving human story, that one can love their enemies and even come together for sacrifice to save others.
I urge all the people who read this that haven't seen it to watch it, and if you don't enjoy it then i can at least say i tried.
If you're the type of person who does not mind subtitling and are prepared to invest a couple of hours and more into the cinematic experience then I'd urge you to buy this little masterpiece.
It just takes us to the scene of the action, sets us down, then lets us get to know some very real people and watch what happens.
And then, boom, there she was and suddenly the electromagnetic field changed.
In an attempt to do what the police (and apparently an effective security system) can't, Will and Sandy stake out their space at night, initially as a team and then just by Will, who forms an unusual relationship with Oana, a local prostitute (played to perfect humorous pitch by Vera Farmiga).
A few more notes then I will finish.
As it was then, I didn't really care much for the family exposition with Law as a live-in boyfriend.
This international collaborative effort between musicians, artists, performers, writers and philosophers, titled, '1 Giant Leap', palls in sections, then blows you away with the power of music and words: "We want to show, through the diverse fragments of music, spoken word and imagery, that despite our surface level differences, the things that divide us are far outnumbered by the humanity which unites us."
In the scene when Will returns to his wife after the stakeout smelling of the prostitute's perfume, we have Liv smelling it, and then when he opts for a shower, she pulls him close for immediate sex.
And there were some dangling strings: why DID the prostitute steal his car and then return it?
Why was the boy so lost and then suddenly so repentant and seemingly on the right track?
I remember watching Breaking and Entering more then a year ago but, at the time, I thought it was a bit dull and slow paced and I ended up seeing only the first half.
See the movie, enjoy the collaborative efforts of several true artists and then learn a bit about what it all meant to this successful writer/director.
at first I had no intention of watching this movie well at first i didnt then i watched the last half hour of it and it really held my attention the next day it was on again.
Very well done, you enter expecting to go into a "back to the future" type ride and then they "transport" you onto the Enterprise (They actually change the floor underneath you!)
If the whole movie had been like this few minutes of good humoured hoofing from a guy who knew how, then it would've been a very pleasant experience indeed.
If you don't expect an academy award winner, then you should find this movie very entertaining.
The sweetness comes from the fact that Eddie Murphy is a jerk to his daughter, and then is all of a sudden nice to her.
This is not a good movie by any means, but if you want to see a bad Eddie Murphy film, then this is the best bad Eddie Murphy film you can get.
- with a couple having sex in a car the night before Halloween, who then get killed by a mysterious, beefy psycho (because we all know that sex kills in slasher flicks).
The direction was good, the actors not bad (although would have been nice to see Matt Philips (Toby) out of drag - damn he's hot), and I would LOVE to see a sequel... if they could make one for IKWYDLS, then they can do one for this...  Watch this movie !!
To put a positive spin on that, then, this is a gay movie straight people will watch easily.
I had heard good reviews before finally seeing this movie and am already a fan of the horror genre.For a gay slasher film it was done tastefully.I like a movie like this that is more realistic instead of being b-rated and campy.I am glad the gay characters were more normal instead of showing all the negative stereotypes that a lot of TV shows and movies show.It's refreshing to see a regular gay movie about ordinary(but pretty)people in realistic circumstances.In some ways it's just eye candy since every character was cute and sexy,but no different then a lot of other movies.This movie has a good story,good actors,and nice effects with the right amount of suspense,gore and humor.It is very well directed,produced as well as acted.I hope a sequel is made to understand the motive to the killings and to see who is behind that demonic mask.
If this is any indication, then there will definitely be more gay slasher films (HELLBENT 2 anyone?).
And then there is the bad acting.
They find the crocodile some spoilers happen, some people die, some people show their boobs, people die, animals die, people die, some crappy dialog his spoken that makes me embarrassed to be alive, some people die, some people die, some people die, then the movie is over, your soul is reaped, and you wish that you had a time machine so that you could go back in time and stop yourself from watching this movie.
Big mistake... Every so often I would see my roommates head just shaking, and he would then laugh or comment about what we just saw- never a good comment.
But after seeing the Ahmad guy tell his boss that he's finish doing deeds for him and then minutes later he tries to save his life, I just couldn't sit there anymore, I turned the damn thing off before my exhaustion drive me to aggravation and might just break the damn DVD which I didn't want to end up paying for.
Deputy Davis then (alone) leaves for the hunt again this time armed with a 'rifle', two bags of meat and some C-4 over his shoulder.
And then the sheriff drops in and asks this survivor what his problem is and the survivor merely shrugs and says "there's a problem" out there on the lake.
And then one of them says, "I can't believe I saw that."
Sci Fi Original movies are known for their suckiness, but in this case, it's more painful to hear the script, then was in "Minotaur".
He dies, thank God, and then, (even though when she said "There's a giant crocodile behind you!
If you like those gloomy historical movies, then this is for you.
But if you are interested in learning about how Bram got his ideas, then watch it.
When I saw it I then watched "Bram Stoker's Dracula" skiping the prologue and it worked well as one movie even though the filming style is different.
Well Pirates of the Caribbean is first then Dark Prince The True Story of Dracula is the second.
Even if the history doesn't interest you at all then watch it just for the quality of production.
/ And in two large jails / You would forcibly gather them / And then set fire to the prison / And the madhouse."
If you are looking for a good cop movie that has a couple of well done sudden violent moments, then there is a good chance you will like this.
And also, it shows how life then was somehow different than today Â quieter, more private Â at least for some of us and the families we grew up in during that time.
and then killing every one in the building with a machine gun.
And then there is that added advantage of it being a silent.
There are changes to the novel Â not only is Bessie Love brought along on the expedition to search for her lost father (with none of the comic relief chauvinism from Challenger found in the 1960 version) but the pterodactyl that terrifies the streets of London has been changed to a lumbering Brontosaurus, which is certainly a change for the better Â but then Doyle's book is rather light on plot to begin with.
But then again, they gave us a Brontosaurus leaping from Tower Bridge, and a carnivorous biped that seems determined to depopulate the entire plateau by himself: this Allosaurus eats a Triceratops, a Pterodactyl, and a couple of things I couldn't identify, and even tries his luck on a Brontosaurus before it falls off a cliff.
Still, if you can put up with it, then have fun!
I just recently got the Image Entertainment DVD Version which restores more then 50% more of the film which originally was 100 some mins.
They then decide to try and capture one of these alive and bring it back to London!
They manage this and bring back a Brontosaurus, but it escapes and goes on the rampage through London, brings down Tower Bridge and then escapes down the Thames.
Roxton first conveys dismay at the budding romance, then resignation as he chivalrously bows out of this romantic triangle.
Even here, however, the suspense is dissipated by the fact we've already seen the Allosaurus (or another like it) attacking first a Trachodon, then a Triceratops, so its appearance in the camp is less of a shock.
didn't have queues around the line - but then who cares about that?)
Maybe I would have liked it better if Terry wasnt a cop at all, but then it would have been a whole different movie.
But then when the Tall Man returns to the room through the portal, he can see Mike?
At one point Jody is seriously maimed and apparently dies, but then in the very next scene he shows up looking good as new, and has to be killed AGAIN.
If you are interested in seeing the deleted scenes, the little bit of the Tall Man's past, and just watching Reggie and Mike again, then by all means rent it.
I said then Gary Oldman should get nominated for Best Supporting Actor and he should have been, except nobody saw this movie, probably because Orion didn't promote this movie at all.
If the technology and audience exists to put old children's shows like She-Ra and Tintin onto DVD, then surely Twins of Destiny deserves the same treatment.
this movie tries desperately to be "the big chill", so if you're in the mood for that sort of thing, then rent the big chill, even if you've already seen it a thousand times.
But if you're sick of films that blackmail your interest in a once-in-a-million character in a once-in-a-trillion-situation, then you could definitely give this one a try.
He then in reality has his arms amputated to throw the police off his trail.
She then hooks up with Malabar.
My first impression on viewing this film was that I didn't like it - then as I thought about it I realized it was a compelling if bizarre movie.
Alonzo then re-confirms his intention to marry Nanon.
But Crawford was essentially unknown back then, and the movie depended on the name, and the high dramatics, of Chaney and the other lead male, the charming, somewhat overly chipper strong man in this huge sideshow of a movie.
For viewers then as much as now, there is also the whole milieu, director Tod Browning's leaning to the macabre and the small time circus.
He then uses his arms to rob jewels at the towns they play in.
Alonzo is the perfect complement for Nanon then, since he cannot manhandle her.
It stands out to me as one of Paul's best from the movie, let's just say the actor can cry very convincingly and put a lump in your throat and when it comes to this scene, his face and eyes portray Dom's torment as much, if not more then the dialogue.
The line 'go to hell or go to 'heaven', just be free' is said with tangible emotion and his body language more then anything screams heartbreaking anguish and defeat.
Even then most films of the last 15 years, the period of time I call the age of "Gay Cinema", focus on REALLY YOUNG GUYS.
In this process, first I watched Page 3 (by Madhur Bhandarkar), and then Satta (again by Bhandarkar) and after viewing these movies, I realised that I indeed was missing some thing in life.
But then, Nihalani finally shows us where he stands, as the story unfolds further.
The Focus is then laid on a small Muslim Community area, where the young muslims are getting carried away by their leader's fanatic guidelines.
this was such a great movie the climax my gid what a climax so great this movie focuses on the Muslim-hindu riots and the friendship of Dev (Amitabh Bhachchan)and Tej (Om Puri) and how Dev has a compulsion to act which makes up for the climax i didn't predict the climax what it would be but Nihalani shows us that being human is more important than anything and if you fail to be one or fail humanity for that matter death will come to you only then basically this movie is adapted from a specific incident from gujarat and some riots that took place there in some life-taking incident overall songs aren't that good except Rang De Ni" it's basically a good movie with everybody delivering a better performance as the movie progresses and the action just keeps you there
The film's premise is about an island being over-run with aliens that slowly and then quickly heat up an island off the coast of Great Britain during the winter.
Then Reggie driving, then Mike sitting in the desert.
Fisher had his actors smear glycerine on themselves to help create that sweaty effect and then they had to wear damp shirts.
and then preach the 1st amendment.
There are movies that are so bad they're good, and then there are movies that are so bad they're crap.
Luckily since we had passes for the convention, it was free, but even then i felt ripped off.
Nothing happened for a day or two, then suddenly I got a horrific rash on my johnson.
They seem to get on well, but then Christoffer confronts his wife with evidence of her unfaithfulness, at the same time saying he forgives he and wants to make their fourteen-year marriage work.
Essentialy the plot follow that of a young boy who pulls a sword from a stone and is then thrust into an adventure to save the world from ultimate destruction, their are of course plot twist (for instance the identity of his mother is quite shocking.)
And then the beer.
And then the title soundtrack - could it not have been lifted from George Michael's 'Faith' to that extent?
Every series has at least one installment that can be called the weakest and 'Phantasm: Oblivion' seemed to be this one's example, but then I gave it another chance.
its like on one hand you see loads of beer-bellied people just drinking for the heck of it and then there's this guy who wants to find a meaning to his life.
It is then that he realizes he has landed in a jail - and a policeman thinks he is one of the prisoners.
If you want to see a weak movie with some cruel scenes then this may be for you.
The stepsister arrives early to check out the place, and is violently attacked, and then thrown into a lake and drown.
They are then the targets of a couple of inbred hicks who apparently are distant relatives of these girls, and are trying to "keep it in the family", so to speak.
when u cant see any dead bodies at the first 30 minutes in the movie, then, its a non-watchable film, dare!
then it is.
The only thing lifting this above total non-entity is a bit of decent gore for fans of the red stuff and even that is all over during the first half of the film (the first couple of kills are the best and then it's down hill all the way).
The guys that made this seemed like they just wanted to recreate some of their favorite slasher horror scenes, then just threw a couple of rape scenes in for that extra shock factor.
Reggie then believes Michael and the two team up and the rest of the series plays out rather linearly.
ButÂthen how could everything have been a dream, if it all proved true?
She looks extremely similar to the granddaughter of the psychic from the original, and I believe, that if everything from part I WAS a dream, then he knew that girl from a separate dimension of reality, the reality we never knew, that is, until we saw glimpses of it in part IV.
And then it's sort of revealed that the girls may have a few family ties with these folks and they're due to keep the family line going.
person hearing this then screams, priceless).
If you like "Faulty Towers" then you can expect to get off on the humor.
I didn't figure out it was a comedy until halfway through but then I found it hilarious.
Eileen Atkins does a great job, but then they all do.
This happened during a Baile dos Enxutos, which was not yet called a 'Gay Ball' then, at the teatro Republica, 1961.
I could not get a clear sense of whether he was lovers with Lurita or Taboo or they coexisted as a "family" unit of unwanted people who found comfort in each other, yet even then the primary character was so cruel to Taboo that it sickened me.
Jaoa takes one step forward, then two steps back--straight in to prison, over and over.
We watch his face in a close-up where an off camera voice is reading what he did, and then we are taken back to watch his life in flashbacks.
If you prefer films like Bridget Jones and turn your nose up to Lost Highway then your probably best steering away from the Phantasm series.
If you're better than that then you're in for one helluva crazy ride.
This adds to the sudden shock, then, after the music stops and finally the reveal happens via blood dripping on the kid's sandwich.
As I read it, Helene's game is to attract men, get them to make an emotional investment, then dump them before she can be dumped--whether out of fear of being abandoned again herself, or as twisted revenge on men in general, or for some other reason.
If Chabrol has any claim to be the French Hitchcock then it is surely based on this, his best film.
On the one hand is the seductive Jayne, a ruthless hit-woman who settles a contract for a mob boss, but then decides to run off with money meet her partner somewhere in Texas.
However, it becomes quickly confusing since a man called Frank gets killed towards the beginning of the film, but then either he or some other man named Frank become quite central to the plot, shortly afterwards.
Had you not known how bad most 1929 and even 1930 films were, then I could see you complaining about the sound.
If I write it for watchability today, then it probably deserves a 5.
Leaden Camera: It's about ten minutes into the film before the camera moves at all, and then it's moved very slightly to maintain composition, but in an incredibly clumsy fashion, like one man trying to move a sofa.
Interestingly, this seems to have been one of the early attempts at using one camera shooting an angle at a time and then using editing to make the scene move.
This starts off badly, with Neil Connery, playing a famous genius plastic surgeon, explaining his advanced techniques and how he combines them with Tibetan mind control - it's pathetic drivel - and then some mÃªlÃ©e breaks out.
This organization plans to steal "Atomic Nucleus'" by woman poisoning MP's, and then raiding a highly secured facility dressed as...cats?
And then as soon as he gets it going, he quits.
First the various mob heads resent Ayres taking over, then they resent when he leaves.
At one point, she takes off her wedding ring, and then they "go somewhere".
We are then introduced to the nuns (all of them very beautiful).
Though every now and then, it appears to go a little over-board with the whole racism awareness biz, the show was definitely an anchor point for individuals who felt that they were not equally represented in the pool of superheroes that we know of today.
The stunts are pretty safe and then there was one, Done with a tire iron and blow torch, STEALS the whole movie and took a father and son stunt team to cook it !
True-the acting isn't perfect-but then again-most of the teens in this movie were just starting out.
then nothing happens in a long time.
It accurately depicted the morals of the country back then, not like some more modern films that like to distort what America once stood for.
Back then, it was more of an entertainment median.
It's lucky, then, that cult cinema God Joe D'Amato is on hand to spice this theme up a little, with a load of nymphomaniac 'nuns' getting up to all-sorts with each other and any man that that happens to stop by.
Since the man narrating the memories was only a boy then, it is altogether fitting and proper that he see things as a child; for as he states in one scene, "our conversation turned from Nazis to more important things,like girls."
If one can glance back at his life and feel a longing towards the past, a warmth emanating from his memories, then he remembers life as having been kind to him.
If you are looking for the normal amount of big laughs from a Woody Allen film, then you will be disappointed here.
And then there's the music.
This important footage was inexplicably cut by the production company, and probably explains why they then decided to release straight to video.
This is definitely worth watching, i never got bored the whole way through, and if you like action comedies and love really good martial arts fighting, and if you are into DVDs then i urge you to buy the disc.
AND PLEASE make sure you watch the Director's Cut, if at the start the main character is looking at a girl on a small video screen, then you are watching the right one.
If you love high-impact action movies strung together with comic interplay then you'll love this.
This is a great movie, hopefully we'll see the director's cut eventually get a DVD release... until then the 100 min version is pretty damn good.
Mark Dacascos became one of my favourite action stars after I watched this movie, but then unfortunately no other film with him in was any good (much like Rutger Hauer - see Bladerunner and Split Second).
And then it's just all action, baby!
If you are looking for a film that is a proper action film with non-stop action, stunts and fights scenes then you have come to the right place.
Marc Dacascos shows of his talents in the lead role as Toby Wang, the hero and scene stealer of the film, Kadeem Hardison is on hand as Malik, the out of luck barfly who gets caught up in the ordeal, then there is Brittany Murphy in one pre-famous roles as a the ditsy daughter of a Motel owning couple.
If you love action, and you love humour then definitely see this film!
Some poor idiot named Malik is sitting in a bar thinking his life can NOT get any worse and then Toby just pops by to make him realize he thought wrong.
If you're a fan of DTV action fare and you want it tight and refreshingly done then this is your meal ticket.
I was like "I hope they won't let this happen" and then a few seconds later it happened, bummer... for me, cuz some people seemed to enjoy themselves, which was even more annoying  Conclusion: don't waste your money on this movie or, if your going to see it anyway, have a lot of beer before entering the cinema, it might work....
By making crap like this they sustain the low level of B-movies being produced in Belgium and The Netherlands and then they wonder how come Belgian films aren't that successful or aren't being appreciated...
It doesn't have any pretensions, other then to just simply entertain and that it certainly does.
But then... the unexpected starts to happen and Mosely must snap out of his delirium because this witness is wanted dead.
Actually, she took that decision better than Carter; cause Carter, being a professional thug, and not being open minded on the matters that women are fickle, had to take the action she participated in as a rape; which he then took action against the man he considered a rapist.
If not, then save your 9 bucks and rent a movie instead.
If you are a Bruce Willis fan then maybe its worth it.
If you're only a Mos Def fan and don't like the Bruce man then maybe the matinÃ©e price would better suit your tastes.
The questions are answered briefly and then the dialog continues with another silly question.
The stranger rides in to town, makes the bad guys pay and then rides off into the sunset when his work is done.
This film undeservedly took a bashing when it was released and since then Get Carter '71 fans have insistently tried to bury it.
Somewhere in Sly's body, Rocky is in there lurking who comes out every now and then to make us cheer.
Because every now and then you may just turn away from the puter' to see what Sly and the boys are up to doing.
The daughter of the Polish neighbor, Manya, delivers milk to Tony every morning, then cooks him breakfast, and eventually comes to take care of the house.
But if that happened there would not be a story because the movie would have to end then.
Watched this film the other day expecting the worst from a 1930s film but was surprised it was really quite good.Its a story of two people from different cultural backgrounds who fall in love,the biggest problem is he is married,so the relationship is doomed to failure.I must admit i didn't care for the wife at all,as looking at this film from a 1930s aspect a woman always stood by her husband no matter what.This one deserts him purely because she misses her socialite lifestyle in New York,if she really loved him she would have stayed with him.I found her totally selfish,and a 1930s audience probably would have felt the same.When you watch these old films you have to forget your 21st century attitudes,as what seems acceptable now wasn't back then, she should have stayed with him.I hated Frederick and the father he was a pig and a bully who didn't care for his daughters happiness,which leads to a tragic conclusion i wont say why.I was really hoping that Gary cooper would ditch the wife then tell Frederick and her father where to get off and run away with the Polish girl for the perfect happy ending,but alas it wasn't to be.I don't understand why this film is forgotten because it is quite outstanding for its day.
And then finally after she runs off -- she and the audience get to hear the sound effect of pigs squealing as they're being butchered.
Didn't expect this movie to go there...  And then when her father, who was introduced as an amiable figure, gets so angry at Sten that he slaps her face with such intensity.
She speaks to him and then he remembers aloud how Sten would look coming up to the house.
I had heard about this film and about how underrated it was,then last week i saw a copy of it on ebay on VHS PAL UK.I was really surprised as i didn't think it had ever been released in the UK.It must be one of the rarest videos in Britain as sadly not many people have heard of it.Luckily i won it for just over Â£3 not bad eh.So if any one else is interested in buying a copy,there must be others available in Britain,if you really look around.I couldn't wait to watch this film,and i must say i wasn't disappointed.Its starts off a mildly amusing story that suddenly gets sadder and sadder until it reaches a climax to a very tragic ending.I must admit the last 10 seconds of this film does bring tears to the eyes,i wont say why,but try and see this movie and you will see.The acting between Gary Cooper and Anna Sten is first rate,her character is very likable as she is totally unselfish,and is trying to please everyone,so she does deserve happiness.Garys character,well he is married and his wife is not a monster and she does love him,so you feel sorry for her as well,i think you have to decide for yourself in a triangle like this someone is always going to get hurt,but you don't know who.Also this is a very early film showing us cultural differences and the sort of conflicts that can arise when two people from very different back grounds want to be together.Can it work?he is from a literate sophisticated family,she is from a poor immigrant family that is still trying to learn new ways.The answer is if two people really love each other then they can over come their differences as true love conquers all,i think overall this was the strongest message that comes out of this film,to some people the married issue may be the point of the film.Any way this is a very haunting film and well worth watching if you get the chance.
But then, if they hit their targets, the movie could be a good forty minutes shorter.
But, giving credit where credit is due, they surpassed my expectations, and then some.
It must have taken the writers a day to watch Die HArd and copy down the storyline and then another day to take the transpose the storyline and set it in another country.
However Nothing and i mean NOTHING prepares you for Dream House,  The film teases, tickles, licks, makes love to you and then tells you it meant nothing.
Watch this film, live this film, then make love to a man with a beard and scream.
if anyone as to say this film was otherwise i think u would need your head testing :-)seens as this film was released in 1998 then maybe back then it would have been slightly better but not by much thanks for wasting my time hope this was useful to you D
Only then does the abandoned Joe put two and two together and conclude Daisy's new beau, whom he blames for everything wrong in his world, is the Avenger.
He then tells Daisy the real story behind it.
The policeman then heares the real murderer is caught red-handed and the real story comes out.
The question then becomes Will he make it, how will he make it, who will survive the journey and whom will they meet along the way.
It's exhilarating to see Hitchcock, in a silent film no less, stage the implied murder of a woman by showing movement, shadow, a pause, then a seemingly over-the-top close-up of the woman screaming, then cutting to the next day or whatever.
And I loved seeing a little note of romance, as a character cuts out a little heart-shaped piece of dough and hands it to Daisy (played by, simply named, 'June' who is a beauty), coaxingly, but then when not accepted right away he rips it in two.
But then we would not have a movie nor the ultimate mob mentality at work.
Hitchcock was trying something new even then.
But then the Buntings begin to suspect that he may be the Avenger and want Daisy as his next victim...  Hitchcock's first thriller and a very good one.
And, if art is to imitate life, then I consider Singles to be a successful work of art.
Since then we have seen the tasteless mess that was "Trail of the Pink Panther", the feeble attempt "Curse of the Pink Panther" and now this...apparently Edwards saw a tv-performance by Roberto Benigni, and felt that he had the talent to revive the Clouseau character, but sadly the result is a painfully unfunny chaos.
If anyone on the movie wanted it to be a success then a bigger name should have been chosen, a David Jason, Dudley Moore or Rowan Atkinson.
Sean Hayes depicted Jerry Lewis to a tee, and if he doesn't garner an Emmy nomination for this, then I decree the Emmys are fixed.
If you enjoy a good biographical epic, then this picture is definitely one to see.
I had mostly forgotten much about this and then a few years ago when DVD's started replacing videos I found a video of this in a nice hard shell case on wide screen format at less than half price so I bought it, watched half of it and forgot about it again.
And in the same scene Dr. Wu is first threatened with a gun, kicks the gun out of the mobster's hands and then starts to fight with the other mobsters, while no one thinks of pulling a gun and simply shoot the good ol' Dr.  Painstaking efforts at acting, especially in the scenes that are meant to be sentimental and/or romantic.
The fighting scenes are of the most boring kind; if this guy is a kick-boxing champion, then kick-boxing must be very lame...
I think if you still want to see it after hearing how bad the acting is, then it's your time and your money to wasted.
If you can remember the imaging from the underwater portion of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, then you can visualize the bottom of Loch Ness, yet Russell's lake bottom is of a bluish color.
The Crusades sees Richard meeting and marrying Princess Berengaria on the route to the Holy Land to fight in the Third Crusade and then having to rescue her when she is captured by Muslim leader Saladin, who has fallen in love with her.
Now, it has often not be said for it is almost as if De Mille build big sets and big stories to tell little moments for all his excess, his movies are ridiculously dialogue driven, even by the standards of the other expensive blockbuster-type movies made back then.
Worst of all is the ending, in which the character I'll just call "Grandpa Exposition" openly says "you each forgot the endings of your own story" and then explains how.... drum-roll... everyone is dead ad caught in some kind of limbo (it's a twist you could predict by reading the name of the film).
The feeling came on like dimensional twist- like I was fighting to stay in my body- my perspective was pulsing, disorientation followed, then the unfightable desire to go and splash some water on my face.
He is able to show us the perspective from young boy Shuisheng, and make us share his fears amidst all the novelty of coming to a large city and then witnessing countless murders himself.
At one point Bijou makes Cuihua loan her some of her peasant clothes and then takes delight in wearing them.
She nails Bijou's nasty streak to a tee and then compels us to believe that she is more than that.
Li shows her hardness of character and complete vulnerability then finally her loss of control, shame and regret.
If you like his other successful concoctions such as the "Lethal Weapon" flicks, "Superman," "Conspiracy Theory," and "The Omen," then you will certainly enjoy "16 Blocks."
The movie then bizarrely goes into another less interesting movie where Lloyd marries this girl who has inherited a house.
This was my third time viewing the film - the first as an extra on Image's DVD of the Silent version of THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927) and the second on TCM, as part of a Harold Lloyd marathon in anticipation of the release of this same 7-Disc collection, when I was in Hollywood late last year; actually, I liked it better this time around, hence I upped the rating from **1/2 (besides, back then, I wasn't as familiar with the star's short films as I am now)!
Another involving the typical self-absorbed nature of people as a man pauses him in another attempt to ask for a light and then the time while failing to notice the circumstances is equally riotous.
Also nothings justifies this opinion any more then the 5-7 minutes of Haunted Spooks.
Perhaps they have never experienced any of the thousands of children stories that show a protagonist doing something ethically questionable and then regretting it in the end (ie, "The Boy Who Cried Wolf", "King Midas", "The Godfather", or any story involving getting wishes).
Back then you just couldn't get enough beads or sequins on a gown.
Maybe if you're a casual TV watcher and don't know good writing or story lines, then you will love this show and think all of the pop culture references are funny.
But then, in todays society, who needs a show to make sense as long as it entertains the masses, which is exactly what 'Robot Chicken' does.
So if you love super heroes but have always wanted to see them sitting on the toilet, then Robot Chicken is for you.
Where else can you see Palpatine answer his phone with the phrase "Go For Papa Palpatine" then lay into Darth Vadar when he finds out the Death Star has been destroyed.
This show should be winning tons of awards, if not from Hollywood then, no doubt, from human rights groups!
Other skits don't touch on much of anything...well to do with anything, humor at that point becomes more personal then ever, as for myself, even those times where I don't quite understand the humor in that specific skit, I can understand what they are trying to relate too which further solidifies their attempt to connect to all audiences in some personal way.
But it did start with a TV-14 rating, and then shocked me with it's TV-MA rating.
I learned a lot, and more than i thought would have come from simply a movie, but then again this is not simply a movie.
All I know is that after seeing "The Phantom" and then "Nola", I was just so let down:-( She seemed almost "average", which she is anything but!!
Why then would the director of French Naval Intelligence rope in a stranger to help do their work?
James Mason is an Austrian refugee from the Nazis who is accused of spying and then used as a decoy by the French authorities to flush out the real spy, who turns out to be Herbert Lom playing his usual sinister baddie.
William Girdler made his directorial debut in 1972 with the surprisingly decent exploitation flick Three on a Meathook, and since then basically everything he's directed has gone on to become notorious - though mostly that's because his films are so low quality, not because of any content.
If you enjoy the 70's, bell-bottoms, fake beards, Creepy Crawlers, or shoving a red hot needle in your eye then this is your movie!
The whole thing ends up feeling like it belongs more in 1971 then 1975, and I don't mean that in a good way.
The movie got to gory too(played almost like a horror movie then a psychological thriller at times)-and the "twist" was nothing to write home about AT ALL.
But then it takes her about 95 percent of the playing time of the movie to explain what happened.
If you like Treat Williams, Hannes Jaenicke, Gary Hudson, John Beck, Julie St. Claire, Ava Fabian, Steve Franken, Susan Blakely, Lorissa McComas, J. Patrick McCormack, the rest of the cast in the film, Action, Adventure, Thrillers, Dramas, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!
Jesus fights off middle aged punks in a hotel lobby, then proceeds to murder an army of dogs and highly explosive buildings!
The Hollywood love plot is sufficiently cheesy enough to be almost unintentionally satirical, but if you want to view a film with more substance then check out THE STORY OF G.I.
I liked it then and I like it now.
Back then most everyone supported the war effort and the doubters kept their doubts to themselves.
If this were to be taken as some sort of Kafkaesque event, then Burkit would have make no remark on the mysterious disappearance, but he express the surprise that any normal person would have.
Finally, after exhaustive work and putting herself out on a limb politically, she finds out how the repressive government worked during the Stalin years--taking a hero and eventually jailing him as a political prisoner and then erasing memories of his existence.
But even then I could not bring myself to care what caused their immaturity.
She creates such a pitiful portrait, but then you sit back and say: HEY!
I liked it even more then expected.
Uma Thurman was BETTER then in the kill bill movies (yes, it's true) and Gena Rowlands and Juliette Lewis were outstanding.
The film is good till the first half and then the director looses control over the film.
It has a simple story line... 4 guys who are not at all serious in life, meets a dying gangster who tells them bout 10cr he has made in life... n tells them to use it as they like... but a inspector comes n enquires them bout it as he is investigating the root of that very money for 10 yrs ... then the conflict starts b/w them as to who as to get the money... everyone leaves to Goa where money is supposedly hidden...
Hey i had a hectic past month and then when i was free today, i thought I had earned the right to chill out with my friends, so I caught the noon show of Dhamaal.Well, how was it?
Some scenes left us all shaking with laughter, like the one in which Arshad 'calculates' the velocity of his car and the angle of projection and then throws a stone to check it, or when Riteish falls right into a luxury coach, which as luck would have it, was being hijacked, or the one in which Vijay Raaz talks about patience and going slow and later learns a lesson.
But hey, as long as they've SUCCEEDED in this rip-off using our desi comic actors, and provided paisa-vasool entertainment,so as to say, then what's the harm??
Lonely, a post-cancer patient, and desperate, Ruth impulsively attempts to swallow a bottle of sleeping pills then confused, stumbles outside her home in Beverly Hills, collapsing onto the sidewalk.
I laughed, then cried....I wanted to poke my eyes out with my very own butter knife!
How this film ever got financed is anybody's guess...someone must have decided that spending five hundred bucks on crapola was better then burning it......They were wrong!
If you are a person who can enjoy BAD movies, then I think that you'll get a kick out of this...others beware.
He then says something like, "Don't ever touch him again!"
Were we more open-minded then?
A year before the slightly more superior TV movie about homosexuality (Consenting Adult) played on ABC, so even then in the 80's being gay was becoming a topic of the day.
There was some interesting camera work, but then, and especially in the dialogue scenes, there was the most awful,awful talking heads thing going on, the most static and boring shots I have ever seen in a motion picture.
But if you want the TV Version (Only one episode) then you can get it on VHS from amazon.com ....
If it had been produced a few years later, and came out on a cable channel, where the idea of a Perfect Assassin could be developed, then it might have had a chance.
If you liked Buckaroo Bonsai, then you'll enjoy Remo.
Perhaps it didn't age well, but I still like watching it every now and then.
porn movie plots and porn movie realism in human behavior/dialog), then you can get through this movie and enjoy it.
And while the show certainly has a contingent of fans who revere it for its space battles and transforming mecha, I have to say that I love it most for starting things off on a footing that allows the viewer to think they know exactly where the story's going to go and then consistently pulling the rug out from under them.
It never really get's really scary, that might be it ... Not the worst movie ever then (not close to that), but still not something you have to watch (unless you're a fan, as I said earlier)
It speeds up then slows down then speeds up again several times.
The travel itself is actually just an accident: when a mission goes wrong and hostilities ensue, the Enterprise flies towards the Sun and then away from it as quickly as possible.
Since then, the comic book series has been one of several to get the live action movie treatment at some point within the past ten years or so.
X-Men was a really entertaining, and overall great film.Than again, I use great in lowest term, but still, I think it deserves to be called great.This movie is one of those superhero movies that delivered and stuck.Most just deliver and then you forget about them, but this one always has to be one of the first superhero films that comes to mind when you think of that genre.The casting could've have been more perfect either.I mean, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, and Halle Berry.All of them I've seen in numerous amounts of films and I think they're all fantastic.This is a good movie, and I recommend it for basically anyone.
For example in T3 Schwarzenegger says he terminated John Connor, in this he almost does, but doesn't succeed, so unless he adds this into the other films, which i doubt as he wont want to keep putting a CGI Schwarzenegger, then bale wasn't killed by him.
This is OK because Connor says its a different future, but then MC G used a lot of history form the others, such as kyle Reese being Connor's dad, and the photograph, this is OK also, but MC G should of chose to base it on the whole history, or non at all, leaving many loopholes because he doesn't decide.
Unless he means hypothetically as a machine, but then surely the machine would know?
Because of that he uses way too many explosions, and action that completely overshadows the storyline, a storyline that wasn't overall too bad if plots had been kept quiet and filmed appropriately, for example, there's a scene where Christian Bale gets emotional trying to appeal to human emotions, and the scene gets you caring,....for 3 seconds then its over, it should of been dragged out, and really got you into the film before the final battle.
I really enjoyed this movie a lot when it first came out 8 long years ago and I decided to revisit it with my little brother tonight and enjoyed it just as much as I did back then.
There is also the issue that powers may be a curse rather then a blessing e.g.
There is not a better Wolverine then Hugh Jackman, and I cannot imagine Dougray Scott , who was the first choice to play Logan, in Hugh's place.
This movie nicely follows two stories mashed into one: John Connor (Christian Bale) waking up and discovering a whole new world, and then meeting Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), and Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) fighting war on the other side of the new world.
If you're a fan of the comic book series as I was, then you'll endlessly enjoy seeing these characters come to life.
It becomes doubly tragic, then, when the fates demand such a harsh, unforgiving punishment from him.
What could have been a heavy-handed woeful tale is instead a story about ordinary people and how the spectre of the then 'new disease' affected a small group of friends.
The faces will stay with you: Mehdi's hyperactive eyes, muscular brow, and disturbed jaw, Adrien's intelligent, bourgeois solidity, his pale shaved dome, has stylish round glasses; Sarah's distracted gaze and scruffy bleached hair; Manu's wild eagerness and frequent smiles, then his skin ravaged by lesions.
Boyd finding out that the money that he so desperately needed has gone to Brenda becomes more desperate then ever to take it off her hands with the bank audit just days away and him facing not only the loss of his job but a long stretch in the state pen.
It follows the pattern of the Terminator movies, a big battle or fight then to some peace and then a big fight and then another peace.
This is a good movie and while I'd more skeletons matching at the humans gunning each other down and then a bit more plot on Conner but what this movie does right is Marcus, not to say Bale did a bad job but Marcus is the show.
First, there's the firm's logo, then, the warning notice, and then, the main menu.
And then, Just like my heart beats gaining momentum, some soft music is audible through the speakers.
There is communal harmony in this village of Muslims and Sikhs, till two strangers from Lahore come to inform the Muslim villagers of the new martial laws laid down by the then President, General Zia-Ul-Haq.
Watching the film leaves you senseless for about half an hour and then it knocks all the wind out of you.
Certainly not a traditional Bugs Bunny star turn, but then there was only one Bugs, but enough cartoon-esquire violence to, as a comparison, make American Psycho seem a documentary,or maybe The Wild Bunch a haiku to male bonding.
And then without skipping a beat, he begins munching on a carrot.
But if Clive Owen is Bugs, then Paul Giamatti is Elmer Fudd.
We have a child born because of a bullet, we have a gun battle midair, and then they even managed to make carrots the most dangerous vegetable in the history of modern film-making.
It has everything I would have wanted back then: Gunfire, swearing, boobies, bad puns, lots of blood, increasingly gory deaths.
The story is negligible: lone man Smith (Clive Owen at his best) observes a pregnant woman in chased distress, delivers her baby, then finishes off the huge gang of bad guys who are in pursuit, taking the newborn boy to transient safety.
Well then I have news for you: don't go see "Shoot Em' Up".
Well that is carried over here, these guys won't stop until their processor is dead, but since they're CGI for the most part it lessens the feel of real danger... Somewhere deep inside the Terminator fan in me was wishing to return to that dark skull covered gritty landscape we saw glimpses of in the first Terminator (this definitely isn't the future Connor's Mother warned him about)  Hardcore terminator fans might want to avoid this, it was better than T3 but still pretty far off the quality of the first two, still, if its a Summer Blockbuster you want then go see Terminator Salvation, you could do a lot worse...
Its starts off with a lot innuendo and then some disturbing moments (like rape) show up.
He then goes and tells the leader (?
John Newlands' beginning monologue reels you in, to have you gripping the arms of your chair during the story, too scared out of your wits to even move, then having the story ending to Mr.Newlands epilogue to further heighten your anxiety of being too fearful to go to sleep!!
The host then talked about a book that had been published in the 1890s about a ship called the "Titan" that could not be sunk  - it was very eerie!!!
They decide to cast Christian Bale as John Connor and then go on to mangle the script to give John Connor a larger role.
And then only because I moved into another section of the country.
His younger brother tells him the stay in the library until their father dies and then comes to get him.
John Newlands' beginning monologue reels you in, to have you gripping the arms of your chair during the story, too scared out of your wits to even move, then having the story ending to Mr.Newlands epilogue to further heighten your anxiety of being too fearful to go to sleep!!
why then, is everyone so freaked by time line errors in T4?
And then there was the highly publicized expletive-filled Bale rant broadcast over and over and over ad nauseum.
Through a flashback, Stein explains to a random striptease dancer how an old & anonymous shaman handed him a peculiar amulet, and since then the sharks obey him.
Also, if the movie was set in Idaho, then why there is no snow and why the people are wearing summer clothes?
If you like mindless action then I guess you'll like this but what made the first 2 films great was the story (let's not kid ourselves, that's what makes any film great).
What was the point of including it, then?
If anyone who is even remotely responsible for participating in Unchained Memories claims this film had any other intentions except to pour salt on a re-opened wound, then I would boldly call them a liar.
All of the narratives were recorded all across the U.S when many of the former slaves were very old in age.All of the stories were then put into an anthology on which this film is based.This is indeed a film everyone should watch and learn from.
Because if we all just sit there like sheep stunned into submission - then we deserve yet another installment of prefabricated plasticity shoved down our throats.
If its zero nutrition fast food fake movie franchise that you want - then you know where to line up.
But for those of you out there who are truly objective and are capable of sitting back and learning something then I would advise you watch this presentation.
And then there is that totally inappropriate score by Michael Nyman swamping scenes of everyday life with a spurious pseudo-classical muzak, banal lyrical lines accompanied by throbbing repeated chords.
If they kill him then John Connor dies.
It's almost as if you saw someone on the bus, and then were able to follow them to their home and around where they work, unseen, for a few days.
She was on the bus, leaned on the windows, made a face that I can't describe, and then her tears poured from those sad eyes.
Have a look and then a second; it's well worth the time.
The characters are annoying and lifeless ,the story line is boring and endless .I think that it could have be something interesting if it have a better writing, but it seems that the writers of the show have more intentions in show Inuyasha and his stupid friends fighting with some monsters and then crying for his tragic love triangle with Kikyou and Kagome and a lot of circles around the same thing again and again .
Rumiko Takahashi has done a LOT better then this.
If you like series with a lot of action, no annoying love triangle, no over repetitiveness, this is not for you then.
Buuuuut then what happens I can't even begin to try to figure it out.
and kills the demon, they get the jewel shard, and then we just repeat this scene 160 or more times.
I thought it might go in a good direction, but then stupid things started happening.
Then we do actually have a good action scene with the large terminators and the motorcycle terminators, but then another stupid thing happens.
And then they had the nerve to end the stupid movie with John giving one of his terrible speeches leading right into the next movie.
And I really liked it then.
And then, the ending of this terrible series was a disappointment to any anime fan out there.
Jon believes that Lydia is trying to make him go crazy so he'll be committed and then she will inherit his money.
But then john begins to suspect that his friend, Devin Blayliss (Vincent Spano), cannot be trusted either.
If your looking for a prison flick with constant violence between the inmates then don't come to this.
Society fails in that it is unable to prevent the original crime; and then again, in locking up those criminals in a world of squalor, drug abuse, and violence, ruled, in effect, by the criminal hierarchy whose delicate co-operation with the authorities is necessary to maintain any semblance of order.
There is also a man who makes strange patchwork Montgolfier style balloons that he tries to send out of the prison walls, which are always too high, there's a very surreal shot of one of these balloons rising and then slowly bursting into flames.
If you have kids then you will most likely cry at the mere though of your children going missing.
I would say that if you are feverish to experience the ruins of Afghanistan and the misery people endure since the war, then you would probably enjoy it.
But, would merely toss them around, fire it's weapons erratically and then stand underneath precariously placed heavy objects, blast furnaces etc...   - The (pathetically mangled) hero's sacrifice clichÃ©.
Here, take my perfectly good cyborg heart...that has just been crushed repeatedly with a giant metal casting....and then nearly punched out of my chest by another cyborg"   Need I go on?
She was able to convey the intimacy that comes from years of being someones right hand, and then to lose that when you have been sidelined by that very same person.
If you like laughing at B class movies, or you are a Dallas die-hard, then this is a film for you!
But then his fear manifests itself, when a creep on the train stares openly and lustfully at Marion.
It's like a vicious cycle that we fall in love, we have a fight, and then we break up, but we return to in love again in a short period, and so forth.
For anyone who is an admirer of Richard Linklater's two wonderful films, 'Before Sunset' and 'Before Sunrise' - of which I include myself - then this rather excellent film will show you another side of Julie Delpy that was not really glimpsed in those films.
The language and culture barriers then act as metaphors for the inability of two people, even lovers, to inhabit another's life and experience.
It is a product of its time - the early 70s - and Hammer had resorted to "tricks" if you will far more heavily then they ever had done so before.
He then slowly shows the results these experiences have have had on the kids as teenagers.
However, I have had clients who have then been abused in care as well.
We sense the confusion turning into acceptance and then, desire.
I can't really pick a target audience for this film but if you like movies that are real and raw then you should check this out.
I have never forgotten it and am still feeling the slowly growing horror it produced back then when I remember it now.
It is interesting because the first half of the movie is focused on Barbara Parkins and then the 2nd half is focused on Barbara Stanwyck.
There is nothing wrong with their accents, thats just how it is supposed to be, and if you don't want to hear accents, then don't watch the movie.
Her performance was as wooden then as in this though she made a couple of good films later.
This of course was unheard of then but is celebrated in our modern age.
It's not the best Hammer movie and the tale, all about an infernal clan who can avoid death and then feed off the blood of the living, is nothing that unique.
If you like campy horror films with a sense of humor, then go find yourself a copy of this movie.
The former owner, Abigail then proceeds to barricade them all inside with no way out and re-paint the house... in blood.
Well you should see the ending then.
I'm not sure why this film has been rated so low, but I'm going to guess it's because most people go into every movie they watch expecting it to be Citizen Kane, and then rate the movie with a 1 because it wasn't a Hollywood blockbuster with 10 million dollar explosions.I'm assuming if you're checking this movie out, you are either a Troma fan or a Zombie fan.
If you love gore, then you will enjoy this film, as the blood and guts are pretty evenly distributed throughout the film and pretty well done for a low budget film.
If you enjoy the atmosphere that 90's cheesiness is able to offer, then again, this is the film for you.
But then again, this is a Troma release, so maybe not.
Since then they haven't replayed it.
It's also helpful to remember that I begin all films at a 9 (an "A"), and then score up or down accordingly.
I guess back then no one invented the occupation of voice coach?
You then realize you are happy with what you have...you just have to remind yourself a couple times out of the day.
This film is not yet out on VHS or DVD so if you get a chance to watch in on TV then I recommend you tape it to watch at a later date.
Morons: turn down the volume and enjoy the two gorgeous nymphettes as they swim in the moonlight, adoringly cuddle one another, and then .
the up and coming Legal Aid in the form of Maya   the definite girls girl in the form of Toni Childs so this show def has something for us all....  Defnaitly something for the ladies but Gentlemen you more then welcome to join the fun....
If there is anything that I am not understanding, then she can show me.
One night Mircalla kills her lesbian roommate (Pippa Steele) and then when she finds out that Giles knows about her she kills him also.
You could say then, that this was a master plan ... but on the other hand, it still doesn't make it an entertaining view.
If that's not enough to make you give up, then nothing is.
Knowing how hard it is to get a film off the ground then even harder to get it out to an audience, I find it ever more frustrating that our choices are limited by distribution cartels.
If you want to see a decent independent English film with a mature sense of humour then this is for you.
If you liked lost in translation, heathers, or anything by the coen brothers, then maybe you'll like this too.
Now then, one can't really portray St. Petersburg as an 'unnamed Russian city', can one?
What a life for women back then.
But the peformances, by then new and upcoming actors Judy Davis and Sam Neill, are beautifully timeless!!
And then she fills it with two things, this translucent actress and a similarly translucent open landscape.
Its a small thing, but by then we've become aware of how wonderfully our hidden woman behind the camera has shaped everything so minutely.
A screen is poked through with groups of "pins" that can be moved in and out, and then is lit from the side.
I've seen it a few times since then, and found it improved in pace with my understanding.
Jerry then responds by spitting water in Tom's face.
Of course, Jerry gets the best of Tom by the end, by making Tom eat some bees and then Jerry golfs a ball at Tom's head, I sure wish Tom would have won more of these battles!
This is another one of these incredible animated shorts that was done with painstaking patience, taking a lot of time to do just one frame, and then doing thousands after it to make an eight-minute movie.
We see a landscape and then a painter.
He then steps into the painting.
She then returns as some zombie type creature, killing off all the horrible relatives one by one, it ends up with a good vs evil battle, with granny having a climatic battle with her nice innocent granddaughter Kelly.
I wonder why 'Glitter' has a lower rating then this drivel, but i am afraid to watch that film to find out for myself lest i wake up in the middle of the night from a Mariah Carey nightmare!
I also remember Harry Morgan from "Dragnet" as being the only cast member I recognized then or now.
But don't let the print put you off, if you get the chance to see this film then don't pass up the chance, for you may find yourself better off for the experience.
I remember first seeing this movie in the 50's on TV as a kid and I enjoyed it then as a social commentary and just a reasonably good story.
And then you realize you too are caught up in the action of mob violence.
It falls to the sheriff (Richard Rober) first to locate the girl then to stem the violence before a lynch mob coalesces.
The scene then shifts to a man called Frank Ventura and his secretary(providing some interesting nudity!).
After this the scene then shifts to the other characters involved in this grisly tale, a man named Fossati and simone.
My only complaint is that I can't figure out for the life of me why movie-makers will always put glasses on a female character (who is obviously very attractive) and then act like all the characters think she's ugly.
After the first murder Bava's camera pans up from the feet of the killer to his black gloved hands in a typically clichÃ©d giallo shot, however, Bava then carries on up to reveal the killers face in a move that goes completely against the sub-genre's rulebook.
They are then killed in quick succession by an unseen assailant.
Filippo himself is murdered, stabbed to death and then dragged off.
The film then introduces us to various characters who all want something from the bay, or the abandoned run down leisure complex.
Robert is then quickly chopped in half by the off-camera psycho as he opens the cabin door expecting to see Brunhilda.
The movie that more then any other horror film opened up the door to the wave of horror/slashers and Giallo horror/thrillers like "Deep Red" and "Tenabre" in Italy and "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th".
Possibly what is so off-putting about this film is that characters are introduced, and then killed off five minutes later.
The best thing about Bava's classic is that it starts out in traditional Bava fashion as a sort of Gothic piece and then it generates into a much more modern-feeling horror film with kids at a lake being hunted by a psychopath.
In a stunning opening, she is murdered, and then just as quickly, her murderer is murdered by an unseen third party.
Her killer is then murdered right after - putting the wheels in motion for 11 more grisly deaths.
The murderous husband is then killed immediately after, by an unseen assailant.
And then there's the gore!
And then STILL this is an utterly stylish horror film.
I would like to have seen more of the girls but then I've always got those type of movies in the top shelf of my closet.
The main story line is weak - we have an introduction to the situation at the start of the film - but then the story is dropped only to return at the very end of the film.
The box seems to scream out that it is a Clerks wannabe, and the guy at the store told me that if I liked Clerks then I'd like this, but I don't' think that's true.
Mark talks to Kevin, then seduces Kevin's girlfriend Debbie at his house.
Barbara Hersey is very good in it as a Professor, and Tom Berenger as a sort of black sheep, a rebel of sorts, with a dog that he loves more then anything.
One goes to the video store and has to comb through aisle after aisle of violent, gory, immodest, indecent trash... and then you find a movie like this.
It also had them protect their unexplored and pristine land with the bravery and ferocity of the then, back in the 1860's, Cheyenne Dogmen whom these now modern Indians are the descendants of.
When I feel the pressures of modern day living closing in on me I can watch this movie and then take off on one of my horses into the wilderness outside my back door and get away from everything except for an occasional, "Silver bird with a long white tail," overhead.
John Barrymore gives one of his greatest performances as the down on his luck Baron Von Giagern,charming wistful and melencoly.Brother Lionel gives his greatest performance as the dying,but zestful Otto Kringelien.Lewis Stone is appropietly flippant and cynical as the enigmatic Dr. Otternslag and Joan Crawford shows us just how pretty and endearing she was in her early career.And then there is Garbo,the mystique that followed her to her grave must have started with her ethereal performance in this film.She is a wonder.
***SPOILERS***It's then that Baron Felix finally sees the light and gives up his life of a cat burglar and con-artist but only after one last fling, in robbing Preysing room, which turned out to be fatal for him.
She swoops her chiffon sleeves and looks meltingly romantic in close-ups, as if she were still in a silent movie, but then speaks extremely flowery dialogue.
At only 26, then, Garbo seems like a relic or a self-parody.
they came, kicked back, and then vanished.
I enjoyed it then and now and regard it as a classic film set in a pre-Code Hollywood that has its own ancient beauty, for more reasons than Garbo's mannered face.
If we are willing to call what happened to the Armenians a genocide, then what do we call what happened to the Muslims?
The sheriff's daughter, who's planning to be in the next homecoming parade at her high school is kidnapped by McNichol, and from then on, it an all-out auto war between the two starry-eyed kids, the cops, and other hot-dogging speed freaks.
that dispatch a couple of the convicts right there and then.
This movie was made by taking out-takes of chase scenes from other Corman movies, filming segues which basically consisted of Jimmy McNichol or one of the police officers jumping out of one car and into another so the car would match the outtake, and editing them together, then tacking on 5 to 10 minutes of exposition and denouement to the front and back of the chase scenes.
Melvin then notices his name on the coffin in the back of the hearse and begins to really freak out.
The movie then goes on like this until the finale.
If they were mummies they didn't look like mummies and I never heard of blood sucking mummies and if they vampires, then why were they running around during broad daylight?
This ninth "Friday the 13th" movie has some interesting story twists that were only then, after eight previous movies, being concocted.
Unless you have a penchant for murders and brutality then this movie isn't just worth your while.
She is chased through the woods (wrapped in a bath towel) by Jason, who is then blown up by a mob of FBI swat men into complete smithereens.
The premise itself is very ridiculous, Jason is blown into a million pieces, then comes back through the bodies of others.
And then eventually (For the last few minutes of the film.)
It's OK for Friday Fans, if not, then steer clear.
then, naturally, a mortician eats jason's heart (out)!
now, the mortician has the power and mind of jason, but it wears on him, like in stephen king's "desperation" and "the regulators" (as richard bachman), so he has to pass on the heart when the body starts to wear, and then somebody else is jason.
then the ending.
then the wind starts to blow the dust, and you see that his mask is still there...and freddy kruger's claw bursts through the ground and pulls away the mask while laughing.
The part i really enjoyed was when Jason got into the police station and defeated all the cops, then when he got into the restaurant and everybody was shooting him.
Oh no, the dark secret is that if you can find someone who shares his father's blood line (cause lets face it, his mother was not born a Voorhees), then you can see Jason finally put to death, or you can see him re-born.
Maybe if I had then I'd be privy to lots of nuances and depth lost on me while watching Goes To Hell.
Maybe if I had seen parts 2-8 then I wouldn't have thought this film was an insufferable piece of tripe.
Final marks then:  Irrelevant macho fights that drag on and do nothing to further the plot: just the one.
The only thing I find stupid ( and it's not even that big a deal) is that you can only see Jason in front of a mirror that kinda bugged me but then at the end when he is reborn it gets much better.
But then suddenly, he is blown up.
I was enticed with what seemed to be a perfect Friday the 13th feel and then they went back to what made the last few suck so bad.
And why did they start off so well and then just kill us when Jason dies?
And to have the talent to make the Friday feel, and then deviate from that feel, well that is just despicable.
Now if they only find a way to make the next film somewhat entertaining, then it could be fun again.
At one point, John D. LeMay's character sarcastically asks a trio of teens headed for Camp Crystal Lake whether they plan to smoke dope, engage in premarital sex and then get slaughtered.
If you want to see a bunch of people and monsters killing and being killed, then this is for you.
That is surprising, because it must have been an anachronism even then.
That got my interest quick, but then I was sucked in by the plot.
Jang initially explores the idea that J is the one that in control of the situation, then hauntingly, the reversal happens when J becomes obsessed with Y.
I find it interesting that this movie made it into America then and Eyes Wide Shut (uncensored) did not.
If you're not uptight and can deal with watching thing that you would probably not venture nor wish to do and want to see a filmmaker totally unashamed and unfazed at exploring a genre, then this is a movie that is definitely worth seeing.
It seems the people writing the script thought of "cool" ideas for a 30 minutes movie and then just filled in the rest with meaningless nonsense.
When I saw this, I then said to my GF, "This could only get better if there was a spy or secret agent or something."
It's starts like a action/criminal movie, and then, in some dark bar, it suddenly turns into a horror type of thing.
The first thing that is somewhat dolorous in Dead Heist is that the zombies are nicely introduced while rolling the front credits, but then forgotten for about an hour Â and when they are brought back you'd wish the wait would have been worth it.
In one of the most silly fights in zombie-flick history they of course succeed (with small back-story interplay and demise of the zombie hunter) and then walk away in the morning sun.
Amusingly, while Bone Crusher and E-40 are advertised as staring in it, yet they aren't in the movie for very long-Bone Crusher appears in the beginning as a patron in a strip club so tame it could have passed for MTV's "The Grind", then disappears.
then there's movies like 'Dead Heist' where you can just tell that people with little to no budget got together for love of making movies and had a great time in the process.
Sharon is tough, bossy and one of the guys but she does have a girlie side too, Berg is witty but a bit childish, Pete is on the quest for true love, never really finding it and then later we get Johnny, lovable but tight.
Robbie Williams said he grew up listening to this music and it has always been his dream to perform, and what better place to perform these songs then in the Albert Hall.
Furthermore, metal or hard-rock (whatever it's called) music is louder then spoken words which made me have to use the volume button more often.
It was a fair cultural shock to see Jim Backus (as agent Locan) in a dramatic role, since until then I'd seen him only on sitcoms & as Mister Magoo.
I have it on tape & watch it maybe once a year & have seen Cagney & co-stars in other vehicles since then: especially Jane Greer in her unsavory "Out of the Past" role.
Yes, the ending is slow & shmaltzy, & it was hard to imagine even back then (I'd already seen scary LC, Jr., in the teleplay, The Ballad of Jubal Pickett) that Jr. was ever as handsome as Roger Smith.
The film then hovers uncertainly between being a comedy (unfortunately it's not very funny), a drama (not particularly interesting) and typical French pseudo-intellectual film where people sit and talk.
The film asks us to believe that because he loans her his phone and tries to pass on a message, then meets her unpleasant boyfriend, he will offer to share his hotel room when their flights are cancelled due to a strike and that they will both begin to open up emotionally.
The manic action that takes place when they try to first turn Albert straight, then as a woman carries the movie.
In a clear nod to the Hollywood epitomized by Billy Wilder she employs a meet-cute to bring the characters together and from then on it's downhill all the way with Thompson's sparkling dialogue slaloming its way to a brilliant finale.
It then focuses in on the duo in on a hotel room as they spend time together trading insults and exchanging banter.
And then he says that he has never found happiness with success.
They might want more land then that.
I was waiting for her to draw two swords at one time or another and kill every Swedish soldier in sight and then begin chanting some spells.
When they understand that and hire someone decent to write the script (instead of burning their money on fight-scenes filmed from three angles), then maybe this could be entertainment rather than just a bland and boring waste of money and time.
If you're still interested in watching it then may I recommend full-frontal lobotomy?
And then prisoners turned ghosts appears and more foolishness happens.
If you can't find the humour in bad cheesy horror films, then this will not be for you.
*Spoiler Alert*   While one of the ghouls yanks the person off their feet with the chain, the second and third then proceed to stab and smash with their sledgehammer and pick ax.
We enjoyed it a lot in Japan back then, it is so cool movie, we even did not know (or bother to know) this is from France.
Today I had a chance to see it again, and was a little worried that being 20 years older, and having seen so many more movies since then, I may end up being disappointed.
Frank then sets his sights on Eastman's secret goldmine, holding him captive and torturing him until the justice seeking brother comes to take him away.
They find something that prompts them to climb the mountain and then one of the men falls down a hole so you get to watch men climbing down a hole for a good ten minutes.
I was racking my brains to understand why it was rated so low Â only 4.4 Â then I figured it out: it was featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000.
But then the ice breaks under the feet of one of the scientists and he plunges into a hole so deep that Agar, peering in behind his flashlight, can't see the bottom.
They find an old stone tablet that tells of a lost Sumerian dynasty, then it gets destroyed when they leave the five thousand year old artifact on a cheap folding table during an earthquake.
The film is quite fun to watch and the Mole People are a little on the wired side but nonetheless they looked good especially for the 50s!If you like the Universal Monsters movies then check this out soon!I think you'll like it!
For the full effect I'd suggest you view the straight version first and then try to find the MST3K episode.
Ritai thinks for a moment and then tells Liu Dong to sell off the confiscated Tibetan Antelope pelts on the Black Market.
Ritai's only comment, "If you don't make it, then it's your fate."
I don't often give 10's for my reviews, but then I don't often run across a movie as great as this.
so disregarding his own life and safety, he rather capture them and risk his life, then to let them go and wait countless years before another opportunity.
'Kekelixi' ('Mountain Patrol') is one of those quiet, quasi-documentary films that now and then rises out of nowhere and has such an impact on the viewer that it has the potential for creating some global change action.
If what I have written here still doesn't move you to see this film then see the film as see for yourself you will not be disappointed.
I don't know what I was thinking back then.
If you like thought-provoking, eerie, movies involving alien abduction then this may be well worth your while.
and there are more to movies then special effects, like good acting, and a great story, and Communion has that, but some people's immature ways of thinking blinds them to that.
I decided not to even finish it back then because it's way too intense.
The first sight he has of the creature in his bedroom is one of the most intensely frightening scenes ever filmed and is the beginning of the real life nightmare Strieber and his family are then plunged into.
She then turned to television with the popular "Letter to Loretta," where she is well remembered for her entrance sashaying through a door wearing a swirling skirt.
They then get it into their skulls that they should take a road trip and invite the only person of African-American descent in Iowa along with them.
It's probably funnier if you've already drunk a couple of 40s ... but then, who does?
If you are a parent and your kids think they are "thugs", then make them watch this and they will understand how stupid they are acting.
True, it starts out almost like a parody or satire of white gangsta-wannabes, but it develops a true context for these characters and their behavior, and then it takes them to Chicago to contrast their ideas with the reality of drugs and ghettos.
If you're a minority who wants to believe everything is about race, then watch it and continue to hate, but for the rational people, watch the paint dry...you'll be much more concerned about the fate of the paint than with the fate of Flip.
It's like a person telling a joke and gets the entire thing wrong, then can't remember the punchline.
I think everyone should wacth this movie, they can laugh and then see the world as it really is so times.
I think everyone should wacth this movie, they can laugh and then see the world as it really is so times.
If you find the site of Uri Geller in a horror film neither amusing or cringingly embarrassing, then you'll get something out of this film.
At the beginning the patients on the ward are cackling then suddenly they stop.
If you can understand what's going on, or care enough to know what's going on, then you deserve a medal.
If you like bad horror movies, then this one is fantastic!
The lights dim and all the colors in the room go weird and stuff sort of blurs, then someone will go "they really ought to fix that!"
If you like your small budget Indy style films, and know what to expect from them then you will be a lot less critical about this film than others.
I saw this movie recently, and I was just as scared as I was back then.
This movie was joined by FOX STUDIOS so the budget could be increased and the GIANT Ants sure looked much better then i would think.
I noticed a few big names in it and the acting was better then most big actors these days.
Wait until this comes to the big screen because you will get much more of an scary and intense experience but if you missed it then hire the video.
Let's consider the following: * We don't find out how the ants became mutated until halfway through the film, and then this information comes from a "super secret" federal agency, and yet podunk sheriff is apparently special enough to get the scoop.
C. Thomas Howell & Martin Kove are better then this while Stella Stevens seems to be having fun & puts in a reasonable performance.
Further utilisation of the kid follows; then it gets more serious when drugs and women come into play.
But then again, you get the feeling of disturbance.
Onto the wrongdoers in question; initially, Herbie is introduced but then we get two of his lackey accomplices living in an apartment; onto a further pair of heavies that come over and finally, Sonny (Stretch) who is the chief antagonist in the bullying of the brother Â to him, it goes beyond a joke; it turns into an actual hatred, a hatred of those with special needs with elements of fascism towards those who are not 'normal' starting to creep into the film and its character's psyche.
And you wont believe it but then I fell asleep..thank god for that.
I'd rank it lower than most of the Rohmer films that I've seen, but, then again, I've never disliked one of his films and most of them I absolutely adore.
So many little things are so right (the best Grace Poole is in this version) , but then disappointing in so many little ways, too.
While talking, the two main characters are in a beautiful outdoor setting then go onto what see obviously a staged outdoor setting.
I then read the novel, my first ever classic novel.
But then her whole concept of Jane is wrong.
His acting turned the hairs on the back of my neck upwards, and I was glued to the film all the way to the end from then on.
Look how crap The Phantom Menace was, and then look at Twelve Angry Men, and how amazing the script was.
Ties and left him bleeding to death, and then went to work raping the other woman, and then killing her.
The Two Mrs. Carrolls was one of a handful of motion pictures done by Warner Brothers which were released to the Armed Forces overseas first and then to the general public.
If not, then it's a bad movie taken from a bad play.
But if he was that sharp, he should also have concluded that if Carroll was deranged enough to kill his first wife by poisoning, then knocking off a druggist wouldn't be much of a stretch.
She refuses to drink a glass of milk he gives her and the police then arrive and he is arrested at the end, keeping calm despite this.
I thought D-Yikes was a pretty decent South Park episode.It has Mr Garrison changing once again.It's really funny, at the beginning of the series he started off as a straight(maybe in the closet) male, then he comes out of the closet as a homosexual male, then he got a sex change operation and became a straight female, then in this episode, she becomes a lesbian!
The whole Persian thing was a bit forced, but then I have to admit I didn't get the Persian joke (where they came from or what group they were making fun of, if any).
This "documentary" had a conclusion first and then set out to prove it.
She asks folks what they think, they tell her and she then presents this as fact.
When she interviews folks who have an opposite viewpoint she misrepresents what they say and then mocks it.
There is a scene in this show where she goes to a convention for the makers of vinyl one of the folks mentions that two of the components in PVC are sodium and chloride which are the components that make table salt, she then says that chemical compounds such as PVC are made up of common elements.
It pretty much fails at saying anything more then what those three branches are and leaves it at that.
If you really want to see this one, please wait for it to be on video, and even then have a back up plan, as I doubt you will want to sit thru the whole thing.
but then, i liked Mystery Men.
It starts out as a simple kidnap that Norm MacDonald kidnaps his bosses dog, but then the dog escapes and the police think that Norm got kidnapped.
What was scary back then might be cheesy now.
Not what you would expect at first "Daughter of the Mind" is a lot more then a ghost story it also has a lot to do with the defense of the United States that Prof. Constable is very much involved in his top secret work for the Pentagon.
The supernatural is handled in a very unusual and honest way in the film by at first not trying to disprove it and then trying to make those who believe in look like gullible and mindless fanatics.
A funny version of the classic comedy based on the 1978 foreign film extravaganza "La Cage Aux Folles" that was then made into a Tony Award winning musical in 1983 of the same title.
It doesn't have the polish and timing that the foreign classic has, but if foreign films aren't your game, then this one is good for you and it works for me.
Well, her filmography didn't list any TV shows (I would have never remembered Daughter of the Mind ) and found the Pamelyn Ferdin website and then ended up here.
He sees the girl's image, he hears her voice - and then, during a sÃ©ance, a wax replica of her hand appears in water, with verifiable fingerprints yet!
At first I was confused but then I figured out what was going on....
Anyway, she picks up the shades and then they break.
If most people are going to learn history from Hollywood, then Hollywood should tell history right or not at all (partial, selective and biased segments don't count).
But if everyone is legal, then there will be no reason to favor one group over the other as the cost would change.
Other then that the story with idea of all the Mexicans just disappearing from California makes a poor poor idea for a movie.
The absolute best piece of prop comedy of any movie, even Buster Keaton's, is when Beldar chews the condom and then blows it up.
Well, I liked Coneheads but then again I liked Dragnet so I'm probably an Akyroid lover at heart that would watch anything he's in an enjoy it.
The sheriff and town coroner find a body in the middle of town and then desert it, saying "it's been here this long, it ain't goin' anywhere."
The director wants us to think that the killer is the girl that was raped in the beginning of the movie, it would make sense if it was, when you look at the body of the killer it pretty much matches the body of the girl but then turns out that when they remove the helmet we find out that the killer is the girls father.
The nail gun effects are all after-shots, where the gun is fired and then the camera gets a close up of the nail already in the flesh.
At least we can laugh at them then!
The pacing slows down a little then, since new moronic characters need to be introduced first.
It gets down to business right away with its rape scene, then moves right along to dispensing gnarly violence.
After a young woman is brutally pack-raped by construction workers, a mysterious leather-clad vindicator (imagine the progeny of 'Darth Vader' and "The Wraith" as an audio-visual cue) stalks, then summarily gelds the attackers with galvanised nail gun precision.
If you enjoy those 'so-bad-they're-funny' movies, then this should surely please.
......then.......it became an Italo-French movie "Le Cage aux Follie" in 1978 with Ugo Tognazzi and Michel Serrault , written by French and Italian script writers (Edouardo Molinaro and Marcello Danon), .......but to see in 1997 a book in a English Bookstore of the American version of the film written by two Americans , made me wonder if  copyright laws had been respected ???
The dj talks a moment, and then plays Foosball AGAIN.
The camera then shamelessly zooms in on her breasts in the mirror reflection!
The first movie in the series had a lot to tell about Bufford Pusser's life and the second in the series had just had few thing that really happened to Bufford but not enough to make it interesting and now the 3rd movie in the series is just horrible worst then the second one and this one doesn't tell anything real about Bufford life except for when he died at the end.
If anyone if planning on watching this movie you should not watch this one and just watch the first in the series its more interesting then this one.Please don't waste your time watching this movie go on and make coffee instead.
Pusser agrees but he's got more problems then he realizes.
the riots had so much history and i was waiting for a film other than trash like hawayein to offer justice and honesty to what transpired back then.
It's entirely possible the film would have worked better without the "mystery" angle, especially since it seems to come from left field midway through the film and then becomes all-pervasive, in direct contrast to the semi-documentary "romantic comedy travelogue" feel of the first half.
If, however, you want a film with genuine emotional depth, that makes you think and resonates far after the end credits have finished, then this may be what you're looking for.
I wanted my husband to come to the Scottsdale Film festival to see this movie with me, thinking it was going to be a chick flick; hoping he'd see a few images of chauvinistic men seeing the light and then turning themselves around, (I love those gentle reminders).
And then The Civilization of Maxwell Bright ended up being the best film I've seen all year.
If Mai Ling can forgive him, honor him, love him -- then so can we.
There are many very funny gags up to this point to where they tickle St. John victoriously but then there's a racist gag involving one Ernie Morrison Sr. (the father of original "Our Gang"s Ernie "Sunshine Sammy" Morrison who would also occasionally appear in Harold Lloyd shorts) that threatens to put things to a halt.
The best part of the whole short--Roscoe's routine: the famous one-handed cigarette roll, striking the match on the train, then leaping into the caboose as the train speeds by--in less time than it takes to read this.
She married the greatest film producer that Hollywood will ever know (Irving Thalberg), but even without having married 'The Boy Genius'(as Thalberg was then called), Norma Shearer would have have shined on her own - which she proved with this film before she married Thalberg.
However, if you are a Jason Isaacs fan and you just HAVE to watch every movie he's ever made (like me), then go ahead and watch it.
I was scared stiff then but now look back on the memories and laugh.
If you want to see a real piece of cinema about Nuclear War, then get yourself a copy of one of the following: American movies "The Day after" & "Testament" or the British films "War Game" or "Threads".
If it comes on TV and the other channels offer nothing then just maybe watch it.... Of course Im sure you have QVC!  
Imagine my disappointment then to sit down and watch a film with a great premise totally ruined by illogical plot development, ludicrous dialogue and characters who I never got to care about.
So to surmise, if you want to watch a nuclear thriller with unintentional laughs which is camper than a row of Rocky Horror Show fansÂ then I'd point you to Wargames, because I simply can't recommend Miracle Mile to anybody.
I first saw this movie 15 years ago; then the night before last I stumbled onto it again.
At the end, I looked at my partner and all I could say was "At least the old folks got to have their sandwich before it all hit", and then I busted out crying.
Who can help but smile at the clunkiness of what passed for "mobile" phones back then, or miss the blatant symbolism of authority figures immolating themselves with a careless squeeze of the trigger?
If you have your heart at the right place,then this movie grabs you by the throat and won't let go...  On the other handiIf you ONLY like comedy's and big budget action movies(which I also like very much)then you're probably going to despise this one...  Go now and find this little gem of a movie,I know you want to...
And we know what happens then, don't we?
It seems as though the screenwriters didn't read the novel, but had instead heard a few things about it, and then went on to write the screenplay.
When you are not free, then you have nothing else to lose thus you have to run after your freedom, however do not believe in freedom until you get what you used to have before losing it.
If you are a fan of the Muppets and appreciate their humour then this is worth watching should you ever come across it.
The appearance of some of the original Real World casts was a plus, and then the actors came in to play and ruined it all.
I guess overall if you're looking for a crazy spin on the Real World then by all means watch this.
But if you are really hoping for a lost season that is authentic, then you better keep waiting.
Yes, it all starts out as a usual MTV Real World episode, where everyone is arriving and introducing themselves then they are invited to a real world challenge, get kidnapped by some lunatic and get "real" tortured in somekind of a jailhouse.
By the way, if you were paying attention, the people that arrived together in groups of two like Cash and Melinda, Liz and Keith, Omara and Adam all had somekind of love connection... and then you have your categorized, spiritual, on-the-side person- Boomer.
If you possibly have nothing else better to do,it's late at night and there is nothing to watch then by all means watch this.
OK, so they try to make this like an actual real world show and then it goes Movie on us and sucks.
For example, if this really was the "lost season" then why would one cast member make reference to the movie "Panic Room" and why would Aneesa from the most recent season of the Real World be one of the Real World alums that was supposed to challenge the Real Worlders.
But then it quickly degenerated into something like the bastard child of "The Blair Witch Project" and "Undressed".
Jeeze Barney the Dinosour is better then this and that is a shame!
I don't think THAT even made it interesting, it just made the movie even dumber then it is!
Plus the filming work was terrible because at times it looked like the way they film in the real world series' which doesn't have that movie affect but then at times it did.
If it was a good rip off of It's Always Sunny, then I would have been cracking up the entire time, but alas, it was just a cheap knock off.
I would like to see about five or six seasons then have a made for TV movie type conclusion.
The story should have been to where she really gained weight, then it would have been more believable.
Well no big surprise that despite being nice to people she gets treated like crap and then befriends a fat girl and a self proclaimed "loser".
Moment" when finally the light turns on...but we all stay in the dark...along w/her...even at the end when her "boyfriend" admit being a jock if she were to quote "get fat"...he would dump her..because well he's a jock basically...she just shrugs smiles...but then again Jenny Craig was the sponsor...guess that should have told me something....at the end she more or less right and don't let the world decide who you are....or I'm not Shallow...just selectively deep;(
We seem to make rude comments about to those who are physically different just because people have low self esteem and zero confidence that they take it on those who appear weaker then they.
Imagine the worst that could happen to you on a journey, and then take that ten steps further, and you have an idea of the trajectory and transformative emotional power of Lamerica.
If Ross McElwee was aiming for a movie about a very sad, very pathetic man, then he hit the target.
He then sinks into a life of drinking and perversion (such as masturbating all over the school, and wiping his semen over library books, lockers and bathrooms).
But then he finds out about the affairs Linda has been having with men in the neighborhood, even the kids' lame tennis teacher Ivan, played by William Baldwin.
We all collectively squirmed in our seats, looked at one another and winced when the preteen Frank masturbated in the school library, then wiped his semen on some books on the shelf.
If this film's final scene was of the four Berkman's going for a hot air balloon ride over the Catskills, and the balloon crashing in flames into the mountains with no survivors, then I just might have walked out of the theater with a smile on my face.
I'll go a head and warn my review contains *SPOILERS* so if you haven't seen the film I then READ AT YOUR OWN RISK....
But still, it was far harsher then anything he uttered before or after.
I'd like to thank the whole crew for making a film about people and human relationships in a time when so many movies seem to be about nothing more then eye candy.
Squid and the Whale is a much stronger film then most, which is why I was so disappointed that it couldn't rise above it's problems to be something truly special.
He's a child--what if her husband had had his heart attack then?
then they continue firing at the squirrel   Bidwell returns to camp after a bear has bit off his leg.
But I felt like it took out all the interesting elements from the first Howling, left the boring stretches, and then added in some new boring elements.
And then after a long and sleepy hour, at last some werewolves appear (hello are you still awake, it took me a lot of coffee to achieve that) and then there is some action.
Later Weiss turns into a big pile of goo and then reconstitutes himself as a Werewolf.
Janice then mentions that sister Ruth talked about hearing howling noises which peaks Marie's interest & she decides to help Janice in her search for answers.
Paul Verhoven himself said, "If he is JUST invisible, okay, then forget the whole movie" If anyone at Sony is reading this I'll say it again;"If he is JUST invisible, okay, then forget the whole movie"  What he meant was that there's no point in just having Kevin Bacon be a voice over.
But other then that this movie stands on its own.
I'm guessing Part 1 was the better half then?
there's only two scenes in which a female takes her clothes off, and then Christian Slater doesn't even really do anything to them.
Unless you are a really die hard fan of the original and feel it is your duty to sit though this, then I recommend you choose something else to watch as this will be a waste of your time.
So, in the span of fifteen minutes, Dawn is checked by a doctor, a diagnosis is made, she attempts to have it removed one way (which fails), then she has to official surgery and gets it removed.
And if this tragedy doesn't teach us a lesson, then Lord knows what will.
This movie illustrates how opposites attract, and then how in a love relationship each partner becomes more like the other as they become a couple.
I saw this movie years ago and then watched it again the other evening.
There's no plot to speak of Â instead, we follow the two stars on a logical pattern of location-hopping around New York throughout which their relationship blossoms: from his apartment when she's evicted because of his snitching (which leads to both of them being given the gate by the landlord), to them shacking up at the flat of Segal's pal (who drives them out because of their constant bickering), then going their separate ways till they meet again (after he has learned about her movie experience Â a hilarious scene Â and a 'colleague' of hers has gone to see him at his workplace) and go out together (where they're harassed by a band of thrill-seekers), after which they find themselves at the house of Segal's fiancÃ©e (a scene with an unexpectedly ironic punchline), to finally deciding to be completely honest with one another (beginning with their real names).
Guido then decides to push her into prostitution, but when he is caught by the law; she decides to escape him and makes a new life with her son and a doctor.
The main character, Evie, is an over-the-hill has-been, who starred in really bad "B" movies, like "Asteroid," and marginal TV show appearances; then there's her roommate who Evie treats as her maid, who longs for a baby but has a sordid past; and finally, there's the ingenue of the bunch, an overweight mid-western wanna-be actress who dreams of being discovered in Schwabb's Drugstore "just like Tina Turner."
If you feel the same, then you will love this movie.
And then there is Varla,aspiring actress who moves in with the two "has beens" Varla has come to the other girls looking for acting tips and revenge!
Evie's dreams involve drinking as many martinis as she can and then having plenty of sex with anyone available.
They then start the most implausible and retarded tree-way relationship ever filmed.
If you enjoyed Jaws and like the "naughty" things in life, then you'll probably enjoy "tintorera" and all its gratuitous gore and nudity(the only bad part is the naked men...blah!)
If you want to see an array of beautiful sea creatures that no longer exist, by and large because they're butchered for no reason in this awful movie, then this film becomes a treasure of historical documentation.
"Unit One" features stand-alone cases that are committed, then solved, each week.
My wife and I picked up the show after the Swedish show "The Eagle" finished and it seemed by comparison to be a very poor substitute for our then favourite show on TV.
Where he took the razor, from the Barber gave the Deputy Sheriff a shave, cutting his face, then dunking his head in a sink full of water.
We then follow the fortunes of two FBI men that come into town to investigate the disappearance.
And, judging from the recent televised court-case, attitude towards African-American's hasn't changed much since then.
Overall then, Mississippi Burning, fails to get its message across but entertains us nonetheless.
Just when you thought I liked nothing more then "shoot-em up" or 'slap-stick' comedies..
But it's a hell of a lot better than it was then.
If you just want to sit back and get a few laughs, then you SHOULD like the movie.
It is not an absolute recreation of the events that took place in 1964, but it is a film that tells a true story and then adds a bit of fiction to make it more interesting for a mass audience.
i saw it on comedy central and then i rented it and forced my family to watch it.
Head Case is a dark and chilling film, but if you solely take it in the context of a gratuitous horror film, then you are clearly going to overlook the main impetus Spadaccini is striving for.
But if marriage and family have not saved Wayne, then it is doubtful his moments of familial good will outweigh his greater moments of sadistic evil.
But if it is yours, and you can handle the graphic violence and frightening look at the human psyche at its most damaged, then you'll be amazed.
If not, avoid it like the plague; but if you're ready for a dip into the dark and everything we fear but never talk about, then watch this film.
If this is an first time attempt which i think it is then it is a very good attempt.
When you find out that he's attached to Priyanka Chopra in the film, you just have to know by then that they are star-crossed lovers.
What is really sad is that the powers that be at FOX have managed to come up with shows (in my honest opinion) that are even worse than this mess since then.
To only be able to go back 20 to 30 years and be able to watch some of the shows we referred to as garbage back then....they seem pretty appealing right about now.
But then I checked her bio and realized she was in one of those really awful "Star Trek" spin-offs.
**SPOILERS** Even though the advertising for the movie "Spectres" makes it look like a ghost story it's a lot deeper and philosophical then you would have first expected it to be.
After recovering from her suicide attempt Mrs. Webber takes her teenage daughter Kelly to their summer home in the country to spend more time with her but just then things start to happen to both of them that are beyond the world of the living.
During others (did they toss both of the leads in rehab halfway through shooting, then continue when they were out?)
The audience was us and maybe a dozen other Farley fans who sat silently when he wasn't onscreen, then you'd hear us all laugh at the top of our lungs scattered from various parts of the mostly empty auditorium (the laughs were scattered, not our lungs, sorry for the bad grammar) when he did or said something funny.
She pulls out crossing lanes and then goes right through a stop sign.
The humor may date it for some and make it fly over people's heads that were too young to remember the economic malaise of the late 70's (I barely remember it, my being a kid back then).
She is planting a new pine tree and then all of a sudden she hits her friend over the head.
If all you know of Miss Page is "The Trip to Bountiful," "Sweet Bird of Youth," and "Summer and Smoke," then you're in for a treat.
If you're a fan of "Baby Jane" and "Sweet Charlotte," then move over for Geraldine Page.
What if she were to hire a servant/companion with a small life savings, dupe her out of the money, and then kill her?
As we see in the first part of the film, there are at least three pine trees before we see the first woman bashed in the head with a rock and then planted.
We then see another housekeeper, Edna Tinsley, killed in similar fashion with a shovel.
All of which adds up to 101 minutes of viewing fun, despite a grating, fingernails-on-the-blackboard music score, and dubious production values which, toward the film's end, have a black Lincoln turning yellow, then black, then yellow again, and back to black, in the span of 43 seconds.
The film then explores the tense relationship between the uptight Englishwoman and the free-floating but sex-mad Julie but things are never quite what they seem.
This film first shook me with its great music, which I later realized as being a classic move by Ozon, then with its setting and ending.
... Ozon lets us see his characters directly; and then through the mind of Charlotte Rampling's (as author) character.
A successful author of a series of mystery novels but bored with her work, Charlotte Rampling goes to the south of France for looking for fresh ideas for a new book, begins down one avenue and then changes direction.
We then see several scenes of just how much she enjoys the solitude, the sun, the quiet, the food.
Finding a new love added to her happiness, so it would have been cruel to audiences back then to have her die in the end.
They fall in love, but then there is a very dangerous stunt they have to perform without a safety net...
It started out as soft port then a horror flick and finally an action sequence.
You have got to admire a movie that sets and then surpasses its own goals.
), try on the new Fall lineup of underwear, then accidentally open a "soul box" containing the spirit of Hockstetter, the notorious "sorority house killer" (last seen in Wynorski's similar SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE 2).
Think about every terrible aspect that a movie could possibly possess, and then add them up.
Feroz Khan made several great entertainers like QURBANI, JAANBAAZ but this is his poorest work and his last try too at direction  He seems to want to glorify himself and his son and hence made this excuse of a film  The film goes around with sub plots, sudden songs, long bike chases and then a melodrama about Feroz-Fardeen  The film has a weak screenplay and seems all choppy  THe romance angle is puerile  The film actually is laughable The film shifts from 1 plot to another suddenly All doesn't make sense and plus the scenes are so badly handled The last scene is a perfect e.g.
if you're willing to go along for the ride then this film can provide some entertainment, if you're not then steer clear.
While in the right hands the scenario of an innocent woman at the mercy of psychos with neither knowing where the other is can be (and has been) done effectively, here Klenhard's sloppy directing and slack writing wipe out any suspense and rack up the unsubtle hints ("You could scream for days and nobody could hear you") while the implausibilities steadily get in the way of any effectiveness - one of the few decent moments comes when Josie is trying to get out of the locked-up condo where most of the action takes place and finds she's trying to force the gate open with the plank the villains used to beat her friend to death, but then you're wondering why they dragged her corpse out of her apartment in the first place.
This movie was a complete waste of time for the following list of reasons (these are only SOME of them):  1- Character development: cardboard cut-out, one-dimensional cliches  2- Credibility Muslim girl parties, dances, wears mini-skirts and then dresses like a North African Bedouin at the mosque w/ a veil.... some BALANCE please....  3- Lack of research Hello!!!
I thought this was in bad taste and then you want people to sponsor all of this.
The heroine's confusion in leading on the lead character and then slapping him for kissing her, the confusion as to whether the Indian roommates are Indian (as in FOB's - fresh off the boat immigrants) or ABCDs(American born confused desis), and confusion as to the objective of the movie - identity questions of the lead character or a general comedy about stupid Indian bumpkins.
But then Jack, her handsome beau from high-school days, arrives.
Arbuckle returns home, distraught, and then -- believing that his wife has cuckolded him -- he calmly strangles her.
And while things get pretty crazy in the end, by then you're really enjoying the ride too much to mind.
Freddy and Albert then head towards Reno, where Albert says his mom has jobs waiting for them at a restaurant.
If you really want to see Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in one of their funniest movies of their early 1940's years, then I really recommend that you see this funny movie, you will be laughing as Abbott and Costello getting into a lot of trouble, but then again, that is just typical for Abbott and Costello, everywhere they go, they always manage to get into trouble!
If you're willing to suspend reality and believe' that anyone looking to pull off a coup d'etat is looking for help from Abbott and Costello, well then sit back and enjoy the fun.
It starts out being incredibly confusing, then you kind of figure out whats going on, then figure out you were toad-ally wrong.
They said, "THIS MOVIE SUCKS" and then turned it off long before it was over, and started to make any sense.
Their hobby, is thinking up different characters and scenarios, then living them out.
The potential viewer then expects to see a campy grossout, but that is not what happens at all.
Most say that they do like this film or it was OK and then add things they didn't like about it.
"The Mayans were presented as savages" - that is because they were(check out their rituals), or what is your definition of a savage?There is another moment in the film:the bad guy threatens Jaguar Paw he would skin him alive and then wear his skin.I first thought, well that was original of Gibson, but then I found out on the internet that skinning your enemies and wearing their skin was an ACTUAL RITUAL of the Mayans.Yes they were savages, and I don't care how many Mexicans(who think they are the legacy of the Mayans, which they are not) feel offended by this movie.
Among these scenes include people being sacrificed by having their hearts torn out, then being be-headed, and a person being completely torn apart by a Jaguar.
But if it is, as I interpret it to be, about the many peoples, societies, and civilizations that were destroyed, that suffered an apocalyptic end on Western contact, then it puts faces in our historical picture where there have been only caricatures before.
To sum it up, this is a glorified chase movie, unfortunately the chase doesn't begin until over an hour in and even then you know exactly how it will end.
If you enjoy cinematography then this is a treat.
I suppose if his motivations are more in tune with 3., then we would have at least something of a theme, and as such my rating could go up to 5. or 6.
If a meerkat that should have died lives on to reproduce, then chances are the offspring won't have the best genes for survival either, which means the meerkats will all need human help to live... which I hope you can see isn't a good idea.
Even then, much of the violence is Shakespearean and takes place just off-camera.
The last part of the movie is a rousing chase akin to The Naked Prey, and again, no more bloody and violent then the film it resembles.
And then, of course, the acting - if you can call it that.
If you like big studio, star-filled extravaganzas, then this is not for you.
It is definitely entertaining to watch, but then again, the long scenes of women dancing seductively etc.
may have been sleazy and exciting then, but they are quite dated and overlong for today's standards, especially due to the fact that these sequences are very tame compared to what was to come in the 70s.
Too bad it's not available on VHS or DVD, when I first saw this film years ago I was blown away , the mood it evokes is totally what living life day to day is all about , pure existentialism, my father was one and I have some of that in me , so I totally got it , Life is but a fleeting moment by moment .Existentialist ,Camus was one along with Sartre it's the same day everyday ,only we ,measure our own decay with the man made notion of time.Based on Camus's novel This film will either impress you or bore you.But then again it all depends on how you look at life.
If you enjoyed films such as Fellini's "La dolce Vita" or "wager with the devil" then you will certainly enjoy "The Stranger"
If 'The Dying Gaul' is someone's idea of 'Black Humor' then I have definitely lived too long.
For the love of God, someone give Peter Sarsgaard an Oscar already Â if not for this movie, then just for everything he's ever done.
Jeffery's wife, Elaine (Patricia Clarkson) becomes interested in Robert, and then a few secrets are spilled which changes everything.
-- then the rest of the story which follows is a careful construction of times suspense that doesn't swallow its conceit whole.
Only then could it jell in a perfect seam.
If you like the glitzy Hollywood never-never land of the rich and beautiful and think that a few Buddhist sayings sprinkled in make it profound then this movie is for you.
With an offer of a million dollars upfront for the script, Robert begrudgingly accepts the change, but then he meets Jeffrey's wife, Elaine, who becomes drawn to Robert through his deeply felt script.
In other words, the movie's not ALL bad; it just falls apart really quick - and unfortunately in just those key plot moments, so you walk out of the theater ready to slice it like a Ginsu, then talk about something else.
So Jeffery, the producer who buys the script, played by Campbell Scott, makes a condition of the sale that Robert change the dying character to a woman, as "everyone hates gays," and "people don't come to movies to feel bad or to learn, you have to lure them in and then deliver a lesson."
But then again, I'm not reviewing that experience, now am I?
But, his elation soon comes tumbling down after he spends the night with a beautiful womanÂ and is then accused of her brutal murder!"
Thoes two movie went much farther then Red Corner.
But the film tries to show how the Chinese today are realizing from their own experience and history, even from their own culture that includes Mao Zedong and a couple other revolutionaries, that they have to change in their own minds and then change their country.
The movie then introduces Grendel's mother, looking hotter than in real life and does a great job of tempting everyone.
One of them (literally) runs into the hero at the beginning, and then they're isolated for the rest of the picture.
Since then, he has produced a string of derivative embarrassments including "Radical Jack," "Avalanche Run," "Lightning: Fire From The Sky," "Psyclops," "Frozen Impact," "Arachnia," "Killer Flood," "Ice Queen," the aforementioned "Trapped: Buried Alive," and this mess.
then, the film suffers from an identify crisis.
Don't use the middle of the film to take me five other places and then later come back to this girl and expect me to care.
The utterly underwhelming secret is revealed, Nick demonstrates for the audience that most career criminals are immensely stupid and then the story ends without ever coming close to justifying the hour-and-a-half of my life I threw away watching it.
This movie crosses you from the Yellow, into the Red, and then the guy from that 70's Show makes ZED have the computer gun explode your stomach, so you're left with only a gaping hole in your torso, where your soul used to be.
It's extraordinarily violent; but then, so are many traditional children's stories, myths--and national epics (the Iliad and the Odyssey aren't sweet little nursery tales; but that's the point: nursery tales aren't sweet).
Beowulf has to battle Grendel, then his mother, and then, later, a great dragon.
The dream censor is ridiculous to say the least Â if they can eliminate wet dreams, then why are prisoners going around raping their fellow inmates.
Yeah, I feel bad for him, but then, I watch his movies.
If you are into sci-fi, future-world or true kick-arse action, then watch it.
It had a couple of decent fight scenes, and I think this should be quite higher then 5.3 in my opinion, plus the opening is quite intense.
The film really is never boring for a minute; if there isn't something directly going on in the movie then Gordon is using the time to build up the situation that the prisoners find themselves in.
Beowulf then becomes King, sleeps with the Monster Jolie and then a monster son comes after him.
Same with PRINCESS MONONOKE and the original TRANSFORMERS movie  The problem is that BEOWULFS 3-D creations more resemble video game characters then actual animated characters.
What makes this sad rather then just a novelty is that Robert Zemeckis used to be such a great director and one of the things he was best with was memorable characters.
If I had really gotten to see the real Ray Winstone playing Beowulf then maybe the small plot would have been less of a concern because I could have related to him.
Fairbanks spends the first 20 minutes scene-setting with plenty of stealing and acrobatics, then tries to steal from the Caliph of Bagdad but falls in love with his beautiful daughter instead.
He then spends the remainder of the film as the Reformed Thief Of Bagdad, trying to win her.
In contrast, Thief of Bagdad begins with the introduction of the titular rascal, sweeping us straight into his escapades, and then building the wider plot and story-world outwards from there.
), Snitz figures mightily in the introductory sequences and the modus operandi of the plot, but then abruptly disappears.
What really impresses is the ending in which the Thief uses his magic dust to create tens of thousands of soldiers out of the earth to defeat the Mongols' take over of Bagdad, as he then sweeps up the Princess in his invisible cloak, and flies off on the magic carpet with her to live happily ever after.
I thought it was terrific then, and after viewing it again now(2003) I still think it is an exceptionally fine movie.
And then there's Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich, both adding bits of irrepressible humanity to the mix.
Of the 3, only "The Curse of Dracula" completed its story (Although when the series first aired, It was already on Chapter VI (But then, none of the three started on its first chapter).
The women, well what to say about them: in every scene they were present, they were seen as objects of sexual desire or were involved in romantic flirt, and moreover they seemed to revel in it, the aging Beowulf's young flame was absolutely sickening in her haste to be "approved" by the then king.
If you're a Dennis Miller fan, then perhaps you should see Bordello of Blood.
And it ended with the people walking away, and the girl of the whole thing was all happy and stuff that she got away from the vamps, then she showed the guy an "upper" part of her leg and she ended up being bitten and she didn't know it and she bit the guy while kissing him and then it ended.
Characters disappear and then reappear at the end.
However, if you've read Beowulf (which, judging by the reviews, is a small number of people), and you appreciate the characters and hold them in a place of dignity and respect in your mind, then forget about appreciating anything about the movie.
He returns to the Geats claiming to have defeated Grendel's mother and is then made king by Hrothgar.
Until then, I give this steaming pile of movie a one... out of ten.
Back then when I thought I recorded over it, I was very devastated.
However; if you find goodie-two-shoe type of girls annoying, then this isn't the animation for you.
OK yes, it's true, this is a cute-sy chick flick, and if you like love stories, then this is an anime for you.
I personally prefer the manga series then the OVAS, but both of them are very good.
But Keiichi thinks that everything she is saying to him is a prank, and then wishes for Belldandy to stay with him forever.
But then he goes home, and it all falls apart.
That appearance means nothing, beauty is truly in the eye of the beholder and if rocky dennis isn't a shining example of that then nothing is.
So, if you're looking for a journey over sometimes bumpy terrain that never forgets about the joyous qualities in life, then "Mask" would be it.
I watched it with my boyfriend, then my  husband, and now with my children.
To all who have seen the movie and read the book, then I am sorry.
The worst that can happen, then, is that Americans try to film European history.
At first Ryder is an annoying, obnoxious, Juno-like character (except she swears and doesn't talk about Argento) but then we suddenly learn that she isn't all we see her to be.
This section of the film elaborates on the idea that some people are who they are, and don't act any differently, but then we know this is never true because no matter who the person is, you get to know them and you see them as differently to how they act on first meeting.
At first he's just a confused foreigner who knows nothing about America, but then we discover that, even though he is, he's also a smart, happy guy who just loves being who he is.
Some brutish looking black taxi driver with a plaster on his head gets ridiculed by some rich guys in the back seat, kicks them out and then mutters to himself, "What a ducked up day."
It's four in the morning when he kicks the two guys out, and then he sees a blind woman on the side looking for a taxi.
A few things happen: They grab the taxi driver by the throat, they moan about their passed-out friend and how bad his life is, then end up in tears when the taxi driver explains how his life is far worse than that of the passed-out guys.
Hrothgar gives his kingdom over to Beowulf and then commits suicide by jumping off the tower of Heorot: At this point, I walked out of the theater and demanded my money back, as the movie had officially jumped the shark with no hopes of return.
The Rome episode then again was a bit better featuring Roberto Benigni as the Taxi driver.
If you like Jim Jarmusch then you have seen this movie.
Unfortunately however if you see this movie in 2-D then you will not be experiencing Beowulf in my eyes, take off the 3-D this is a 9/10 movie, with the 3-D it gets the 10/10 rating with a blink of an eye.
If you like your films classy, well written, well acted, intelligent, thought provoking yet accessible, and with a great soundtrack (Tom Waits), then Night on Earth is for you!
I watched it in Hungarian, and then found an English version.
I liked it then, and I still like it now.
Antropophagus reaches into the pregnant character and pulls out what looks like the fetus of a small animal, proceeds to take a single bite- and then Bam!
He then stuffs his mouth with some (half-decent) looking intestines that he pulls from said axe-wound which opened his chest.
I saw this film (uncut) straight after Absurd and kept wondering when it was actually going to start - there is one initial scene where a guy on a beach gets a meat cleaver through his head (extremely unrealistic effects) and then the next "excuse of gore" is a head in a bucket which is so pathetically unreal I nearly split my sides with laughter !!!!
I know Joe D'Amado is hit or miss, and I've enjoyed a number of his films, but unless you want to see his worst movie ever then stay away from this film.
A good start, then a slow and a bit boring in between and it's only the last 15 minutes that makes it worth watching.
This is the only Joe D'Amato film I have seen without it's trademark explicit sexual content,but this does not mean it is not as extreme as,let say,"Emanuelle in America".A group of tourists arrive on a Greek island,without knowing it is inhabited by a demented,cannibalistic killer.The movie contain some graphic and very disturbing murders,especially in the last minutes,when the maniac eats a fetus and then devours himself.Add a good dose of suspense,great make-up for George Eastman and ,surprisingly,a very sad story behind his character.So,if you want to see a truly horror classic I recommend "Anthropophagus",even for those with a weak stomach.
The terrified survivors then set out to unravel the mystery, rescue the still missing Maggie, and find the strange disappearing woman.
The scene where the group is searching the basement is one of the most eerie in the movie, and then, completely unexpectedly, Rita jumps out of casket with a knife in her hand.
When you get to the last half hour, then the movie flies into gear and knocks you out with a punch, but other than that, there are some notable events here and there, but it's mostly rather dull.
They then find the French couple's blind daughter who is deeply traumatized.
It looks great, it takes chances, and it surprises you every now and then.
Dear IMDb-ers, This B-movie, which was originally titled "Peak Experience" and then "Lost Lake", may be a new genre of movies, let's call it 'Promance Movies", because it has elements of porn in it, but its actually very romantic, so abridge that categories of p(orn)romance into 'Promance' as a new film category which the Adams (the married director team of this movie) may have inadvertently invented.
Okay this show is better then any I have ever seen.
Mind you, the first time you watch this show, you will be confused, but give it a few episodes, then you will agree with me.
I always loved the show and found it really funny, although watching it now (8 years on) I know there's a lot in it I probably didn't get back then.
it shows kids the truth about so many aspects of real life and then goes and does that.....shocking.
Kennedy High is then sold and converted into a nursing home, forcing the students to leave for college early.
Everyone did an incredible job and I am pleased to see several of the cast riding other roads to fame as of 2008 (Christopher Gorham on "Jake 2.0" and then the successful "Ugly Betty").
Pretty much everyone knows the story of Beowulf - man fights monster, monster's mum and then a dragon - but this ancient story has inspired generations of writers and academics, now it gets a shiny makeover courtesy of Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary.
So why then does this movie fail so horribly?
I like the general kinky story line--a seemingly innocent woman about to be seduced by a dirty old man--and, then, the tables are turned and you find out that the "innocent woman" is one sick woman--and, then, you see that the man is actually a good match for her because they are BOTH sick puppies!
It's one of those movies that never really gets started, then you realize, it's not going to tell you the story you want.
If only we had the technology to truly capture the aromas of the food, then the only thing missing would be to actually be on the set and taste it all.
Until then, I'll watch this movie again and again.
Scenario:Good..The tie-in's are great,the evolution of characters are good,first the dream sequence which gives us emotions of characters to frp style evolution of their work style;first stealing math exam,second stealing their pre-test exams,then the final one..  Jean Claude Van-Damme:We see him talking french and being himself and B type movie style kick and steal sequences,what can we ask for more for this film?
But then again, isn't that what Bunuel is best at?
But even then it's never really clear.
The audience is almost given the most fractured romantic tale in modern cinema, where you do (or at least I did, if not more on the first viewing then both times) feel for Matthieu who is not really as flawed a bourgeois character as in 'Discreet Charm', and is actually a rather nice and easy-going fellow.
But then Conchita has her point of view, which everyone *should* accept, but then the tables are turned, more than once, leading to why that bucket of water was poured on her at the train station before it took off.
When the server girl - the vendor who the film is about - gets picked on by hordes of people, Charlie comes to the rescue, but he ends up hitting on her and then getting turned down.
At least then you won't be able to remember it the next day.
Much has been made out of BuÃ±uel's use of two different females to interchange with the lead character, although anyone who has researched the film knows that this was unintentional and has no greater meaning then necessity despite wild fan theories.
I mean, if we were all like (I can't remember her name, she is so innocuous) well, then, we wouldn't have a movie or any color to the world, would we?
Mitchell fought hard for money that to further develop airplanes that the Army and Navy wouldn't even ask Congress for if Congress were so disposed to give it back then.
Military historians from then till now still debate the value of the airplane in war.
In The Longest Day there's a famous scene where two airplanes take off and make a strafing run on one of the beaches and then fly away.
That was the sole contribution of the Luftwaffe, by then they had no more contribution to make.
Gary Cooper's Billy Mitchell, despite deviations from the real story, is a remarkably accurate picture of a dedicated officer with unrestrained hubris whose public and volatile denunciations of Army and Navy superiors for numerous fatal crashes led to his then highly-publicized court-martial.
Ambarassing at first, then, when I saw that it was a Peter Jackson movie, I could only laugh.
But then Jackson and his companions told the secret.
Harvey Weinstein, then chairman of Miramax, reaffirmed Mr. McKenzie's genius and emphasized how happy Mr. McKenzie would be that Mr. Weinstein himself insisted that an hour be cut from the restored film.
Colin McKenzie was an unsung genius who periodically would disappear, then reemerge with new inventions and passions to over-awe those of us who now are familiar with his extraordinary accomplishments.
If you are a New Zealander and see this without knowing it is a hoax then you will be bitterly disappointed to find out later.
When Peter Jackson (yes, of LOTR fame) discovers "lost" old movie footage and then arranges restoration of same, he finds a historic record of work by one of the country's pioneer movie makers - film that shows, among other gems, proof that Richard Pearse achieved powered flight before the Wright Brothers.
If you appreciate a prank on the grand scale then you have to see Forgotten Silver or, better yet, see it with an unsuspecting friend.  
But then little doubts start to creep in, and this is where much of the humour is.
From then on we treated the whole thing as a lark and just revelled in the imagination that is Peter Jackson's trade mark.
If you can't trust a documentary then what is there left to trust in the world?
And then, months afterwards, I found out.
If you are a fan of Angela Molina then check out 'The Eyes The Mouth' to see more of her.
If you enjoy historical thrillers then this is a movie for you.
It starts with gathering the players of the band in a small town in Iran and then travels on by bus through the battered lands.
Wake up these sort of films are not original and not even good story telling , Australia has made a many better films then this one, lets hope this vanishes into that wilderness of forgotten dull Aussie films.
I highly recommend this game if you like star wars then you will like this game.
Kyle then goes to Luke Skywalker to get his lightsaber and force abilities back so he can avenge Jan's death.
In this game, there is still an unmistakable requirement of skill, if nothing or nowhere else, then when you face multi-player foes that are superior, and possibly a boss enemy or two, as well.
However, I think it was more daring having only one person, then, play Mathieu--and especially narrate it.
And then, of course, there's the sack.
Watch this movie and then ABC Family's The Secret Life of the American Teenager, and you'll see the similarities.
They are then attracted to greasy food and (of course) chocolate, and they don't eat it, they rub it on the affected area.
FINAL VERDICT: If you like war movies, then don't miss this.
You see the enemy, you kill while spilling blood all over the place, get killed while spilling blood all over the place, and then you make people cry.
i have never been so moved to see such a movie then Flags of Our Fathers, and i know that this movie will awake the eerie memories of WWII vets from the war in the Pacfic some 65 years ago.
If this movie does not win at least 3 Academy Awards, then we as a nation have lost a patriotic feel towards our history.
And why did the owner of the club refuse to serve Conchita just after she quit, but then the next time, he practically prostrated himself for her.
Any sensitive man or woman who knows the depth of detail of the greatest battle in the WWII Pacific Theater, the "Battle for Iwo Jima" gets tears in their eyes not just for the incredible loss of Marines but startlingly enough, for the tragic, needless loss of the Japanese soldiers who had dug themselves deeply into the island's rock-like volcanic ground and fought to their deaths from bunkers, many remainders committing suicide in keeping with the then prevailing philosophy of war in Japan.
The author of the book was the son of a US Navy Corpsman (a medic, then rated as a Pharmacist's Mate) serving with the Fleet Marines whom history had placed at the point where the large flag was raised over Suribachi (a replacement flag for a smaller one raised shortly before).
At the conclusion of the story, there was a long silence among the audience, then one person began to applaud.
If you've seen the previews, then you've seen the movie, because not much else happens.
And then the ending third of the movie seemed like an after thought and totally useless, like the filmmakers suddenly realized they haven't bored us enough and needed some more useless, unimaginative, uninteresting, drab filler.
The actors more then carried their own weight.
The film then switches between their tours of sporting arenas and speaking engagements and flashbacks back to the horrors of the taking of the island in full vivid detail.
If you can just watch this movie, not question anything and enjoy the absolutely stunning fighting of Jet Li, then give it a watch.
but then again, you are talking about a bunch of fossils who think Shakespeare In Love is better than Saving Private Ryan.
All you really need to know is that if you enjoy this kind of action, then this is one film that you can't pass up.
If he continues to make films like this, with a flair for the ridiculous and an eye for action, then I think he will be around for a while.
There is not much to dislike about it, unless you don't like violence and then I would recommend you stay away.
But if action and chop socki and deceit and betrayal is what you crave, then go see KOD.
True, this isn't the most well-written role the actress has had (well, then again, she's not really give many well-written roles in the first place, is she?)
And boy of boy,if u are a fan of fast paced kicking and punching and incredible stunts then this the movie for u.
If you like this then I suggest checking out The Transporter.
Bridget Fonda did not do much (found her irritating in some scenes) but then again, did not watch the movie because she was there.
Diana, of course, had exactly the same beef, but then she was demoted on her divorce.
Winston Churchill, robustly played here by David Calder, was a principal supporter of Edward just because he was a prince, but then Winston was a rather romantic old Tory.
When I saw the preview on this production and its subject matter, I thought "Oh Lord, not again", but then considered that maybe it would shed a different light on the events.
RH was being aired on Soapnet (89) on cable, and then out of the blue they redid the schedule which was to exclude that great show.
On every show, Letterman shows the "great" speeches made by JFK and FDR and then all of a sudden shows Bush stumbling or saying something stupid during his speech.
Because up until then, I LOVED Paige best, and then Becca.
The public will then vote for who leaves that week.
I just can't watch Big Brother for more then a minute and always tries to avoid watching it.
If you want to see these people getting what we're begging for, then watch Dead Set by Charlie Brooker.
from then on in, channel 4 realised that they are better off marketing this as entertainment, voyeuristic and easy to watch TV.
i suggest you try it, and if you don't like it then fine, but don't prejudge it when you haven't seen it
Since then,there has been an explosion of similar publications,perhaps not quite as cringingly oily to the so-called famous as the aforementioned terrible twins,but if anything even less intelligent and brainless,with similarly garishly coloured photos thrown in for good measure.I am sure there are still plenty of talented writers,actors,singers,comedians,dancers,etc.
If this and other programmes of it's ilk are allowed to continue,then we can well and truly say that the great days of British TV will be gone forever,and that if you have no talent whatsoever,rather than vice versa,you'll become famous thanks to the brain free writings in UK tabloid newspapers and magazines,describing the numbingly unexciting events in these "reality TV shows",the most unwelcome media development in history.A disturbing trend that has to stop sooner rather than later.
If there was ever any iron-clad proof that Britain is the most uncultured and TV-addicted society in the world then the dredge that is Big Brother is it.
That fame-grabbing, wannabe, desperate individual then begins their definite, inevitable, inexorable descent into well deserved obscurity.
For the past few years I keep thinking that 'THIS has got to be the last one' as BB constantly goes from bad to worse to even worse then to absolute hell.
Andre Braugher does well in this movie but then any fan of his shouldn't really be surprised by that.
The DVD director's commentary explained why the opening sequence doesn't quite "match" the rest of the piece, but by then you're into it and don't care.
If you liked the way he handled himself in True Vengeance then you definitely need to check him out in Bloodsport 2 & 3.
It wasn't long before 'Vertigo' and by then, Kim Novak had become an icon, which she remains to this day.
Then too, the final line presents a poignant slice of ironic insight.There's the inevitable comparison here with the thematically similar Double Idemnity, but then Novak is no Stanwyck and MacMurray is a ten dissipated years older.
If all you are looking for is eye candy (and there is plenty of that) and lots of blood then this is probably the movie for you.
The tough and potty-mouthed police officer then eases up and teams up on the potty-mouthed ex-cop & they set out to find the killer.
If you like movies souly for senseless kills, then I suggest you go find some other (horrible) horror film then.
Not that I have a problem with that but mostly that attracts more then the gore.
A group of friends find themselves being killed off by a serial killer who knocks at your door, and then kills you.
I can't remember any of their names, and some would disappear for long lengths of time and then die quickly (after having about 5 minutes screen time total previously).
None of the characters put up a fight at all, and would be killed very quickly and then they would be brutalized after being killed.
Malcolm goes to his Managing Editor and tries to resign but becomes involved with a young girl being murdered and from then on all kinds of hell breaks loose.
!The movie starts off well posing some very serious and thought-provoking questions...and then falls apart.
Hemingway is saddled with just being a whining girlfriend at the beginning--and then she becomes a helpless victim.
****SPOILERS**** Superior crime drama set in South Florida during it's "mean season" when the winds pick up and the storms and hurricanes come rolling in and with them rolls in a serial killer who's more interested in publicity for his crimes then his victims who are a result of them.
Every standard suspense element is there:  1: Several scenes where you think the killer is coming, big scary music, then it turns out to be someone else.
Instead, a blue beam from the jet car zaps the mountain, and then the jet car goes into the mountain.
My Rating: Severe Eyebrow Twitch Warning My Review: In the cult movie world, there is The Rocky Horror Picture Show and then Buckaroo Banzai.
If one was not familiar with Doc Savage or any of the other pulp heroes, then that person may just look at the movie and wonder what it was about.
If you didn't get that with the "baby bang" reference from "Doctor" Penny Priddy during the press conference scene, well, then I'm sorry, but you're hopeless.
If you own the DVD, as I do, then you probably know that practically nothing was created for this film.
The screening was sparsely attended, but you could tell that some people "got it" even then, and many didn't.
The film opens with great promise showing a well-executed battle scene interspersed with text explaining the political landscape of the mid-1600 but then rapidly goes downhill with below average technical production.
They see some weird thing in the distance and go towards it then suddenly their cameras shut off and they're trapped in the Nexus, so they call for a group Marines and a scientist that has been in the Nexus to go the base, they arrive their and later on the gateway opens with one life-form detected.
I did enjoy watching Xtro II: The Second Encounter and if you're in to low budget sci-fi horror flicks then check Xtro II out for some Alien copying fun.
Now I got to admit this is far better then the first movie.
Now just because this is better then the first movie (like it could be worse) does not make it perfect by any stretch of the imagination.
The storyline is promising as this lab is set up to send people to a parallel universe (and then of course bring them back...right?)
It was dull it was pointless it was a rip off of alien for the first part then Aliens for the second.
I've now seen it a couple of times, once when I was a lot younger (and it didn't impress me then) and again more recently and though I don't regret watching it, its hardly a good film.
So, is it then safe to say that this movie probably was made by young teenagers, unaware of the different aspects that make a good sci-fi/horror movie work?
I'm still trying to figure out why I liked this movie back then.
He then forged a career playing character parts until the 1950s.
After the accident they find Toomey is blind and then this big storm comes.
The discussions remain however the plot line gets confused...then again this is a three hour movie and I was watching it late...then again its really confused.
Helith and Asrael are then charged with influencing man to save or destroy the planet.
The story basically resolves around a loser (Donella) who meets the perfect girl (Bartlet, who is very easy on the eyes), but then loses her number, so does everything he can to find her.
When a movie tries too hard to be funny , then it's a bad movie.
When they are finally forced to revel their treachery and the one he has been pining for declares him worthy of her love, he says "Okie Dokie" and forgets about getting his penis crammed into a Chinese finger trap then pushed out front of an audience.
I think the story was pretty awful and rather scary then funny... Chad Donella on the other hand does a great job.
Well... maybe the depiction of Behemoth then.
Had there been some acknowledgment of the way that their respective relationships had developed badly, had the girls acknowledged their poor behaviour and somehow learned from it, only then would they be worthy of his unremitting attention and friendship.
I mean any film that goes from explaining how someone feels, to a nose-dual (don't ask), to a guy that gets screwed over and then forgets about it, all within such a short time-frame, is hard to really look at objectively.
I almost thought it was real(for a split second of course)and the fact that the year 2005 is Just around the corner, theirs still no manned space flight or a women president,But 2010 is right around the bend so maybe then.
And after the crash Peck quickly sprouted some impressive bristles, which then all but disappeared.
SPOILER: We saw Peck realising he had found water, then there was an immediate switch back to the airfield where the CO explained what happened next.It was almost as if the makers of the film had realised they were running out of time or money and decided to omit a few scenes.
It was shot on site in, what was then, Ceylon.
if movies of this kind suit your taste, then make this on part of your collection.
The film is also rather poorly plotted, with it all going well until we get to about the hour mark and then it takes a horrible downturn, almost into the realms of boring; this is a far cry from The Godfather films for Coppola.
It is Citizen Kane with--if not a happy ending, then at least an optimistic one.
It could try but then it won't appeal to a wider audience which prefers easily digestible adaptations.
It's somewhat ironic then that the only other guy to really get something out of American Zoetrope in its early years (not counting its peaks and valleys in the 80s), was George Lucas, who turns the tables on the usual dynamic of Coppola producing Lucas' early films to producing Coppola's own film this time around.
then, once i told them about it, they were very eager to see it.
release), then I STRONGLY urge you to buy this movie.
We have Carbine High School, and all the fine stereotypes that go there; the jocks, the greasers, the religious nuts, the Goths, the whitey-hating Afro-American, and then the two that don't fit in anywhere, the ones in the black trench coats.
However, back then, the only way to get hold of the movie was by purchasing bootleg VHS copies for outrageously expensive prices.
he explains the inspiration/context (but not too much to spoil the presentations) behind each work and then you are able to watch each video.
If the intention of this drama was to educate me then I wouldn't have been very pleased.
That said if you enjoy Roman history or if you enjoy political intrigue,scandal,murder,plots and treason then this really is a must see.
Also, look for some then lesser known actors and actresses who are stars now.
(3) I had the good fortune to read both books before the series was made, and then to watch it with a critical eye.
A VCR and a DVD-player were unknown back then, and I always hoped that one day I could have the movie in my possession.
I searched the internet and bought the DVD, watched it together with my 13 year old son, and he loved it as much as I did back then and now.
Most of which were little known then but have since gone on to become better-known.
Like the serpent that appears in the open credits, the story twists and winds--and covers several generations of the ruling family as Rome slips from the republic to royal rule, largely due to the manipulations of Livia, who has few if any scruples in her determination to rule first through her husband and then through her son.
It's the sort of sordid tale one finds only in the most disreputable of tabloids, but then rendered in gorgeous prose and delivered by the finest actors.
There are no holes in the plot, it's a good vampire story, and you can have a good laugh too now and then.
the rest of the cast in the film, Horror, Thrillers, Dramas, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today!
Movie Nuttball's NOTE:   If you like Stephen King then I recommend that you check out the following films!
It is not surprising that Cohen picked up on Stephen King's small-town theme, then, creating his own 'Lot' for his own type of vampires.
The "psychological cat and mouse game" consists of endlessly boring, repetitive dialog and people acting one way and then another for no reason.
Seeing this movie at first made me think this looks good... infact I think it started good then gradually got worse then it just buried itself.
They have their momentary sexual thrill and the chance to have someone really listen to their problems and are then cast off by the Woman before any real emotional bond can develop.
VD is a convict, who escapes from a jail bus & then helps Rosanna arquette.
Give Van Damme a shady past, something he's not proud of (in this case, being an escaped convict involved in bank robberies), and then halfway through have him blurt out his crime to the love of his life.
If the main protagonist does get injured in the course of all his brawling, then don't worry.
So to sum it up then: a BOG STANDARD ACTION MOVIE with no bells and whistles, but plenty of Van Damme TAKING NO PRISONERS AND KICKING BUTT.
In the pantheon to JCVD films, I would recommend STREETFIGHTER and TIMECOP above this, but if you've WATCHED EVERY OTHER ONE OF HIS CLASSICS then this might be just what the doctor ordered.
Indeed there is a very awkward moment where Rosanna Arquette and the daughter in the movie discuss Van Damme's penis size at the dinner table, which then has Kieren Culkin all happy that his mom has seen Jean-Claude's penis.
Relationships with her two cute kids begin and then things really heat up with mom.
If you're in the mood for something quiet and disturbing then have a look.
If you want a big bang then i'd forget it.
The trailer says "Van Damme, as you've never seen him before" and then just gives us a bunch of poor action clips.
She actually leave the responsibility for the family's functionality with Allan, who then tries to "make Dad happy", whether it's by acting as a pimp ("Sanne, Dad is crying!
And then answers her phone all proud of herself completely clueless that everyone there now thinks she is a total moron.
It would also be interesting to know why the movie was completed in 2001 but not released until 3 years later, and then only in Belgium and Holland.
We then see our killer, he is inside a bar where he kills another woman, and nearby is a strange man(Burt Reynolds).
The end of the episode shows to old Italian men singing a song as the body of the killer is hauled out of the parking garage, some kind of festival is going on, as the camera zooms out you see the face of Mr. Burt made from the lights of the city far below, and then the screen blacks out to the credits.
Scream deconstructed the horror genre and then used the fact that we all new the "rules" to find new ways to scare us.
Then the mockumentary melts away into a horror movie where you *think* you know exactly what's going to happen even though every time you think you know what's going to happen you're wrong, then every time you guess and you're still wrong.
The premise of interviewing a slasher villain is nothing different from Man Bites Dog, then the movie just uses the exact same jokes and plot points as Scream.
And then, all of a sudden he goes to boobietrap a house where about 6 kids or so are gonna have a "party".. And then he just kills them all.. And they tape how he sets all of his "boobietraps".. so basically you know everything that he's gonna do when he's gonna kill them, as he first shows everything on tape.
And then he just ends up killing everybody, all the guys filming, too, because they decide to stop him, apart from the girl, of course, that is one of the two, i guess, main characters in the movie.
ÂÂÂ SPOILERS ÂÂÂ PS: I hope Leslie will rise again from the death for a second part x_0 PPS: If you are disappointed by this film then go and rent Man Bites Dog... it's much more dark and cynical as I mentioned before.
If you like a film that defies genre, that was made outside the mainstream and asks you to think a little then you could do worse than take a look.
If you want an action fest don't bother but if you want to be challenged, surprised and in one particularly poignant moment actually moved then check it out.
I was hoping for the camera crew to catch a glimpse of it and then pull out in utter disgust.
What would it be worth to you to be able to interview these guys BEFORE they started their careers in stalking, terror and mass murder, and then have the rare opportunity to be able to follow them, step-by-step, as they outlined every trick of the trade, every detail of how they create their 'legend' at the very beginning?
Acting: This is hard to classify seeing as this is a low-budget B movie, but sometimes the actors do a great job and then other times it didn't work for me.
fan then you MUST SEE THIS FILM!
Those require more effort then the viewers might consider.
And then rent it, with friends.
If you remember Star Trek: TNG, and I do, then you'll know that the Borg didn't wear helmets that covered their entire heads.
Discovering horribly disfigured corpses of the lost team upon arrival, an alien running through the jungle keeping tabs on the team, members being picked off one by one and even killing one man off then hoisting him high up in a tree.
Of course then there is the universal theme of tossing in a nuclear bomb that needs to be disarmed.
If you liked "Predator" then go and watch "Predator 2", that was an interesting follow up (although missing the presence of Schwarzenegger) ... but watch "Code Red" ONLY if you like a descent into "C movies".
If you've only seen Hollywood movies, then you might think that this is art, but otherwise, your in for a dud.
There was much merchandising back then, and we collected ape trading cards and ape dolls.
But if you view it as a children's film which was lovingly made and has excellent artwork considering that it was all hand-drawn, then you may very well like me find yourself watching it again two or three times within a week before reluctantly returning the copy to the video store.
He changed his mind, but then was afraid to move.
When it got to the scene near the end when they are bringing the child up the ladder, it sticks then cuts out to the menu.
She then goes to her childhood home, a rather large mansion, and this is where most of the film takes place.
And then the end-credits scroll the screen while a darkly ominous drone colours the soundtrack.
Peppermint Patty and Marcie arrive then to buy some more eggs.
Back then, Linus was all set to greet the Great Pumpkin in the middle of a pumpkin patch on Halloween night.
I have not seen it in years, but it cracks me up as much now as it did then.
I saw this for the first time since I was 7-8 years old, I had a fuzzy memory that she took the downward spiral, went into seclusion and then came back with a roar singing THE ROSE in concert ending the movie.
Rose just wants to play one last concert - in her hometown to show the locals what a star she's become and then (as she says repeatedly) she wants to take a year off (and from the looks of her she could use it.)
What a dazzling radiant star that burned so brightly for so short a time and then was so suddenly and prematurely snuffed out.
We started out with "The Rose" at 8pm and then concluded with Crawley Films Academy Award winning Documentary film "Janis" at 11pm.
It was only then I became extremely gratified to have been in the film.
Watch him as he pauses before he gets into the tractor trailer that he's just hitched a ride with, watch him as he looks back at her, almost reflecting, thinking, for just a moment, reconsidering his choice, and then makes the decision to live with the choice and get on the truck, going God only knows where, leaving her.
And then come back and tell me that this film was crap.
The beginning of the show, in the Wedsworth-Townsend Act, everything is quiet, your seeing the fire trucks, then you go up the pole, see all of the fireman and then, breaking the silence, the big loud fire alarm blasts waking not only you but also the fireman up.
Johnny and Roy are one of the most memorable characters from the jokes to the rescues and then to serious matters, you can always know that they are ready for anything.
After the date doesn't work out, the mother takes it out on her son, who leaves then forever and, like his dad, joins the merchant marine.
Just wonder when they found "Monster" in water in LOST then it would be too lame.
The set-up of an up-and-coming boxer who fights his way to the top, is then bribed into throwing a fight and has to choose between his integrity and the payoff was an established clichÃ© even back then.
How he gets exhausted and swings from one side to another in the ring.And then we see the dog in the ring hanging from the behind of the opponent.Hilarious, just hilarious!
Fun to play but if you want a fun storyline with great graphics and gameplay then you need 007: nightfire.
As for the cast, I agree that I expected Ming to be older and have a more vicious look, but then Ma and Pa Kent were pretty old already by the time the found the little alien baby.
To my surprise, it actually improved significantly, going against all known laws of television shows, which generally peak with the first few episodes/seasons and then drop off from there.
If you want to spend an hour in front of the TV (45 minutes if you TIVO it and cut out the commercials) and you don't want to spend the whole time figuring out some intricate plot or learn the newest criminal investigation techniques, then watch Flash Gordon.
It's like sci-fi was back then, without the X rating.
So then we get dimension rips or wormholes or whatever and out steps a heavily armored cyborg who is hunting the for something.
But wait just then a woman bursts in and saves flash by shooting his torturer.
If it's any better than "Agent Under Fire", then I'm sold.
But the first thing he does is to cover for this hoodlum, and then I was wondering why I should even continue watching it.
First of all I never saw the first two Crocodile Dundee movie's personally I think its not a great movie but it is entertaining but some of the jokes ar not so funny but there are also a few good joke's but still I liked this movie paul hogan acting very well as Mick Dundee now I want to see the other 2 movie's and I heard they are better then this one if thats true then I really want to see them I give it a 7.5/10
It was good to see Dundee (Hogan) in a different venue other then the played out scene of New York.
The film spends the first third fleshing out everyone but the centerpiece and then doesn't give him any depth as he stumbles through his thick cockney mumblings from one costar to the next.
And she plays well opposite Hogan (but then, she should; they're married in real life).
It's just about some entertainment...  but i would suggest to watch this movie if you like Indiana Jones and movies comme Ã§a.. if you don't, then don't bother to watch this one...  to those who saw the first two a long long time ago all ready..  You must love this one too..
CD in LA is not a classic, but doesn't aspire to be, and if you're simply looking for a fun, light-hearted comedy, then this is the movie for you.
If you are in need of a clichÃ© ridden, stereotypical trawl through a fantasy England, then this is the film for you.
Most of the stories centered around Hunter & McCall's cases - usually homicides; one episode that made my skin crawl was one that appeared in Season 2 where McCall is raped by the son or a foreign diplomat, who then insists his psychopathic son is a saint and shields his son from answering for his criminal behavior behind diplomatic immunity.
The plot is actually quite simple, they both flee New York to find a small peaceful town, then while finding work they are framed for a bank robbery and placed behind bars, then in the thick of it all they plan an escape while Wilder's character participates in the Prison Rodeo.
If you liked the Tasmanian Devil in the Bugs Bunny cartoons, then good news, he has his own show.
So, Tom wants to impress her but ends up being outwitted by Jerry--who then tries to woo the girl cat (that's kind of weird, huh?).
For example, it's hilarious to see Tom pretending to sing "If you're ever down in Texas, look me up" and playing a guitar at the same time (while he hears the record), to seduce the cowgirl (the well known Toodles, Tom's passion), but Jerry makes the whole thing even funnier when he decides to give wings to his own sense of fun: he ruins Tom's plan by changing the speed on the record player, which causes Tom to sing very quickly and then extremely slowly (with a typical cowboy voice).
I also find very funny when Tom is disguised as a cowboy and walks like one, rolls up a cigarette by using Jerry, a gun to light the cigarette and then smokes it to puff out the word "Howdy".
He then blows a smoke ring that says, "Howdy."
Tom then serenades her (with the cows singing the chorus!).
If you're happily content in a stable, long-lasting relationship, then you will see this film as a comedy about things that happen to other people.
I watched some of the "original" first then switched over to the Troma version & while the original was pretty funny (unintentionally) anyway, the Troma version was probably much more funny.
If you like a lot of moaning, groaning, grunting, screaming, squealing, shrieking women, then you'll love this movie.
It was a movie, filmed in english, then redubbed by the Troma Team.
Like I said, the movie's humor is very juvenile and adult but if you're into Troma films then you'll dig this one big time.
The film is horrible and the dubbing is very immature but if thats your cup of tea then its a fantastic film.
A fate worse then death for anyone who's hooked on gambling.
Seeing just how things got out of hand after Tony became his partner in the bookie business Vinnie then decided to quit the racket but only after he not only cleaned out Tony's clock but his chicken livered,in his always buckling down to his Mafiso boss Locasso, Uncle Pete's as well!
If you're looking for a good movie that doesn't demand too much of your own psyche to understand it, then give this movie a watch - besides, Donal Logue's performance is NOT to be missed!
If you want a good, cheesy horror movie (and can stand the sight of all the creepy crawly critters) then you can't go wrong with this.
You'll hear glass break, then you'll hear someone scream, then you'll see a body on the floor with anywhere from 3-7 frogs either on the body or on the floor nearby.
In this way then the plots don't work anymore, it lacks logic, it's hard to get the motivations of the characters.
Sam Elliot is the 'Chief Brody', as it were, of this film, playing an ecologist (so then he's 'Brody' and 'Hooper' combined).
OK when i was younger and seen frogs for the first time it was kind of scary,then as you get older you find all the mistakes and plot holes and such.this is no way as great as Alfred Hitchcock's the birds.this one deals with a bunch of rich people all celebrating the 4th of July.y birthdays on a Florida island.the patriarch(Ray Milland)who was a hunter before his crippling accident invites his family members all doltish and strange with the exception of his granddaughter(Joan Van Ark)and a model(Judy Pace)and a photographer(Sam Elliot)who is just passing through after his canoe is capsized by a drunken boater(Adam Roarke)the scenes with the animals attacking are really bad.and don't come off as realistic.a harmless rat snake,harmless geckos and anoles,even a snapping turtle,a slow moving one at that.there is a scene where some of the characters flag down a motorist.and the motorist stops for them one of them is carrying a rifle.OK if thats me i would'nt stop for anyone especially if they are carrying a rifle.
If you have sympathy for young petulant pretty girls that invent crises of their own because their life is too uneventful, then you may sympathise with young Leelee, but the fact that she decides life is worth living because her Chinese neighbour cooked her some spring rolls with chop suey and then washed and ironed her dress properly pretty much sums up the vacuous nature of this character and also of this turgid film.
My only criticism of the casting is that the role of Grace should have been given to somebody who could really sing like Bessie Smith, and then given a chance to do so.
I loved her in the long blonde hair and flowy summer dresses much more then her typical costumes designed to show off her body.
If you can't deal with it then just change the channel.
Apparently it's not murder if you knock someone out cold and kill him then club him in the back of the head to frame someone else then go on to bribe another person to commit perjury in a deposition.
But, I guess since she has big eyes and 2 x chromosomes, then that makes it okay?
If you like "Moonstruck", then you will probably like "The Butcher's Wife" too.
The show centered around disco dancing and each episode was a dance contest where about 5 couples would compete for cash and an opportunity to advance to semi-finals and then the Grand Prix competition, where they would actually win a Pontiac Grand Prix.
Something inexplicable happens, slowly the mystery and the number of incidents grow, a scientist comes up with a possible explanation and then the grand finale where the special effects and the military come in (with lots of - sometimes inappropriate - stock footage).
It takes half an hour before the monster is shown and then you get a good 20 minutes of more than passable special effects.
I hope to see a DVD soon out there with some nice extras & more then one version of the film an Audio Commentary by Ray Harryhausen & Ken Ralston would be nice because they did one on King Kong another Willis O'Brien Stop-Motion Classic!
Sold in the set with Attack Of The 50 Foot Woman (1958) & Queen Of Outer Space (1958) it doesn't belong with those Sci-Fi Films it is 100 times better then both of those films.
Also heard the print is clean & looks great sharper then the Laserdisc I actually didn't get mine yet so I can say by me.
In an atmospheric night scene reminiscent of Beast From 20,000 Fathoms, the Behemoth, in silhouette, wanders into some power lines, reacting first with shock, then anger as it attacks the high-tension towers.
If any of this makes you the least bit curious about Sun Ra then I would recommend the film, which is available on videocassette.
It's great to watch Pleasance strut around pompously in the beginning of the film -- hey, after all, he's the President of the United States -- and then eventually be reduced to a pathetic, animal-like, gun-wielding thug, no better than any other criminal trapped within the walls of Manhattan.
Anyhow, if you are a fan of John Carpenter, then you MUST see this film.
If you're a fan of futuristic action/adventure films, then you also MUST check this out.
But some of the jokes are not so funny, as others have mentioned there's the Jager/Neger joke, then there's the shooting of the fanfare musicians (would it be funny if someone really did it?)
If they had set the date to 2097, this would still have been the same movie and then we wouldn't have know that this was impossible.
If you don't know nee 14 means nearly 14 then you might be confused in some parts.
It starts off one way and then becomes a completely different experience, and it's a fun ride the whole way through.
From the start of the credits, which shows Swansea bay and then pans up the hill to uplands, showing all manner of local characters, I was howling with laughter...I used to live in Swansea and I think the whole thing depicts "The Pretty Shitty City" in a fairly accurate manner.
Trust me, if your into foreign films that speak English or if you like British comedy films, then watch this.
All we seem to have had since then is a load of cgi filled soulless film equivalent of a fast food outlet (Hancock?).
The whole point of revenge is to go one better than what was done to you, when someone blows up your entire family, albeit unintentionally then what better way to dish out the moment when said opponent in the battle of revenge meets his maker, than by carrying out your dead fathers wish.
Everything seemed to be going along beautifully, then came 'The Weakest Link'.
But if people prefer movies like "Op pÃ¥ fars hat" and "kampen om den rÃ¸de ko" then I come short of arguments.
And then once in a while there was a one liner, that made the whole cinema laugh.
More then a dozen of German comedians in bigger and smaller parts: find them, check them out, notice their comedy routines and feel a little bit like a 12-year-old - the only way it works.
Much more charm, then I expected, I don't care for many misses, I had enough hits to laugh about.
Stiller is then thrown out the window and beat up by the old people.
Also if you have liked any of Sandler's other films then Happy Gilmore is a must see.
if you liked this film then be sure to see Billy Maddison as well)
If you like immature fun, laughing at people goofing off and stuff like that, then this is the film for you!!
And then there's Mr. Larson, Happy's 8' tall monster of a former employer, threatening Shooter at every turn.
But then, like a steam engine pulling a long train, the movie starts picking up speed.
We have been searching in earnest first in stores and then on the internet and discovered to our dismay it was never recorded and sold as a VHS or DVD movie.
The film carries you through the stages of basically a pathological liars life from childhood problems into adulthood very quickly, then gets you to the meat of the story.
This is Far better then the sequel Darna Zaroori Hai.
I have seen the movie and read reviews that were posted about the movie Indigo.I never even heard about the movie until a week or so before the showing.I personally know one of these children,most of the time he is just a normal little boy like any other child,he doesn't do a lot of the things that Gracie does,but I believe that her character was just a mix of their gifts to show what they can do.The main point of the movie that I feel is the most important is that they are here to bring out the truth,they can see behind what adults and others tell them.You will not pull the wool over their eyes,they CAN see right through you and read what is in your heart,your pain from the past wrongs in your life.And also the good things about you.They can and will heal the planet.The other thing I feel about them is that through the real truth, they will bring peace wherever they go.They came here with their switches turned on,in the past people have had to go through a life changing experience to be enlightened.Near death experience comes to mind.I pray that I meet more Indigo's,If you meet one you will never forget it,he sometimes looks at you suddenly from a break at playing and tells you something about what has been troubling you for some time,then he has that all knowing smile and off they go playing again.
A bunch of Unity people got together after the movie to have pot luck and talk about the movie, and no one would say anything.....just two people brought up a couple of "lines" that they thought were good and then silence!
I seen this movie at the Library like 2 or 3 years ago and didn't really want to pick it up, then I picked it up this year because I read the entire description that meant like Indigo children have powers and I just thought that it will make it a wonderful and inspirational movie, but when I first turned it on, I felt like I fell asleep in a nightmare of demon spirits until when I got to the part where they were in the house and a little girl was in the car.
Only then their new project, a film about Neale Donald Walsch, can become successful.
The seeming moral of this movie is that you can take a couple that is drifting hopelessly apart, strand them on a deserted island for a couple of days, and then they can live happily ever after.
But then they take it to the next level.
That is she neither a man that age changes as such without some prior history nor a girl presented as she is at first presented does what she then does.
Those that do what she does have a much darker past then we are lead to believe.
These comments may not have convinced you to see this movie, but if you did see and liked Short Cuts then I highly recommend this film.
And if Short Cuts is gobbledegook to you then I recommend both.
It gave me a reason to live, if for nothing else to see the end of the movie, but then again, if I were dead, I doubt that I would care.
Wilbur meets her, then, as she saves his life when he was trying toÂSoon, Harbour and Alice fall in love, and she moves in with them, alongside her daughter.
She's also in director John Crowley's "Intermission" (2003, script by Mark O'Rowe) - taken on, among the stellar cast, the rather offbeat yet still demure role of Sally (the script itself is plucky and unyielding alright - then again, it's probably quite 'normal' in the setting described) - another amusingly enjoyable film from Ireland if you're so gamed.
The script contains no subtlety or finesse, giving us the bare bones of what passes for key moments in the story, and features dialogue that makes you presume it was written in a foreign language and then translated using Google.
But if you like films with a strong emotional/melancholic atmosphere that are touching your heart without any of the ingredients that are used for "Hollywood Mass Production Romantics" then the chances are good that "Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself" will give you a wonderful experience beyond words and you might loose so many tears that you become almost dehydrated in the last part of it.
I did not go to see it then but remembered the odd title.
So every now and then he tries to commit suicide.
The plot however i thought turned very sharply from one direction to another (wilburs suicidal tendencies to his relationship with his brothers wife, and then the end scene).
Thus Fallon and Viel created Rane, an ex-cop who has his future taken from him (in more ways than one) in a brutal opening sequence, and who then proceeds to make the perpetrators pay dearly for their actions after putting an arrow in his head (see what they did there?)
Add a well thought out soundtrack to the whole heady mixture and Deaden delivers the goods, and then some.
I, like most other contributors, had bought this film for 99p merely because Michael Caine was in it, and then I read that someone else paid only 97 pence, I was indeed robbed!
Excuse me, have they redesigned shotguns, then, the back window would have been blown clean out or shattered, most of the shot would have lodged in the glass, surely?
Then, it would have been slightly dangerous and risque, perhaps even exciting (then again perhaps not).
OK so I think its good fun,  On the TECH level  I dug the look in some areas more then others such as some ext stuff looked Well videoish (Being that it was shot on video) while the some of the INT especially when Rane fights one of the main bad dudes (who was giving a blowie to other dude) hand to hand had a cool gritty look, Girlie Club also...I wish the latter look was kept throughout more, that's just my personal taste..There's a lot of gun action going on in this flick!
If it had spent more time detailing the characters and concentrating on the plot then it may well have been quite an effective little thriller, however as it stands it's merely just a passable one with a strong central performance.
Overall then, Cop is a routine thriller with only James Woods lifting it from the mediocre and into a competent drama.
The first half of the film is really rather good and plausible; but then the twist hits and it really requires a suspension of disbelief from the viewer.
He's the kind of cop that blows your date away, leaves his partner to clear the mess and then asks the woman if she needs a ride home and have some fun.
If you liked the Onion Fields or is role in any number of films that would otherwise have been pants then you will like this film.
First, they convinced him to give his power of attorney to his "loving wife"--who then sold the mill!
If the script were actually realistic, then we poor American citizens are in a world of trouble because the so-called national security is not even second rate, but probably fifth rate.
The same scene being shot in plain day and then pure darkness was not only confusing at first, but extremely annoying.
The movie to me was basically teaching the viewer about the cultural distractions that the Wolof people in Senegal are beginning to be more influenced by other then there own.
The director, Moussa Sene Absa's did a below average job directing, since there are scenes that are shot in the day then suddenly are in the night time.
Everyone will enjoy this film as they watch it, and then will think seriously about its consequences.
The plot doesn't make much sense at all, it was truly incoherent and all over the place as one scene slowly dragged onto the next without any real urgency, then you get a twist that you see coming- but then it would twist back on itself and your left scratching your headÂ fancy that?
Instead for that hour we get look at dark rooms and more rooms, in many different stylish ways- but then something actually happens and it picks up in the last 15mins, though people might have given up already and I wished I did.
If this is 'European art' then the words 'Emperor's clothes' springs to mind.
But then we get to the plot, which is really really weak and terrible slow.
Later, Claire and the fugitive boy break into a house during the resident family's absence, and then attempt some sexual fumblings in the parents' bed ... only to be caught in the act when two people walk in.
Van der Oest uses a very contrived camera set-up to make us think that the arrivals are the parents, then uses a reverse angle to reveal that they are actually the family's son and daughter.
It starta as an interesting movie, but then it turns into torture porn.
The first third of the movie is not too far removed from being a drama about a group of children in the summertime; but as the film moves on, things start to get dark pretty quickly and by then the film grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the credits role.
One of the few films that doesn't shy away from showing what human cruelty is, and shows that it is nothing short of disturbing and tough to endure, I've watched the entire film and I'll say that I am a fan of the horror genre, but when it comes to films based on actual events and you find out that they are disturbing and tough to watch, then you tend to view them under a different light than your regular horror films.
The foster mom begins to abuse the girls and then singles out Meg and gets her kids and numerous kids in the neighborhood to abuse her.
First comes frustration, then anger, then violence, then abuse.
The story has so many holes that you could throw it in a cave in France, take it out in a year, then slap a sticker on it "100% Grade A Swiss Cheese".
And the neighbors were so clueless in this small town (where scandal and gossip is usually welcome amid the boredom) that they were unaware that the drunkard single mom on the block (divorced moms were suspect back then, too) was feeding alcohol to their own kids and raising a brood of bully, violent brats?
After branding Meg's belly with derogatory expletives and then lighting a blow torch (at which point a member of the audience vacated the cinema), you know Ruth has gone beyond sanity, beyond any hope of an existence that can ever escape the mental ramifications of her sadism.
In fact, if it's not strictly a horror film, then one can only conclude that it's the genre's loss.
We watch them meet, become friends and then as events spin more and more out of control we see how completely helpless the boy is.
It is far more horrifying then anything I have ever seen and the script makes it come to life which makes it even more terrifying....
If you are looking for a horror movie and don't have heart problem then watching it should be a priority just expect to feel horrible afterwards...
There are lots of preachy/teachy speeches at first, before the murder, and then a full obsession into finding the killers.
Once they got it they put it over Jenny and then she died.
The "People" that did that to her In my opinion should have gotten more then a slap in the face by the mother who took the one girlfriend, Ellen into her home.
and then starts wearing her clothes and trying to be her.
-If they can handle it (but I think we all know that, by then, they will be desensitized well past the extremes of this movie).
What a surprise, then, that "Seven" is the type of smart, suspenseful, brilliantly-designed and -acted thriller that is nearly one-of-a-kind ("The Silence of the Lambs" follows close behind).
Even Gwyneth Paltrow, then a fresh-faced, relatively unknown starlet, delivers a small yet poignant performance as Mills' long-suffering wife; her scene in the diner with Morgan Freeman is painful, culminating in advice that seems especially dismal, considering what we've come to expect in the way of Hollywood Happy Endings.
I found it only mildly offensive personally, but then I also love the movie "Pink Flamingos."
If you're not a fan of non-stop swearing, crude humor, musicals, satire, violence, or just South Park in general then don't watch this.
But then again, if you know that you're an easily offended person DON'T GO SEE THIS MOVIE!
But then again, aren't we all getting pretty sick of political correctness?
Rather if we all came together and put aside the divisions and stereotypes, then perhaps we could all see the humor in remarks and jabs like the ones made in this movie.
I think that everyone (who has an open mind) should go see this movie...and then go again and take someone who doesn't have an open mind so that it can be opened by the hilarious things said and done in this movie.
But if that is what we want, then we have to be willing to go all the way.
Don't try to watch the movie from a causality standpoint (if A and B then C), just sit back and enjoy the ride.
If you catch it, you'll wonder if you saw it, then you'll be angry that you've never heard of it, after that you'll never forget it, it's just a shame you'll probably never get to see it...
Arthur Lowe is slowly turning into a parrot (which is then eaten by Spike Milligan), while his wife, the owner of her own death certificate, turns into a wardrobe.
But then who could pitch such a missable curve better?
Tenma then rejects Astro and Astro is attacked by the military.
Overcome by remorse, he creates a robot duplicate into which he transfers Toby's memories (as well as rocket powered flight and assorted weaponry), but then finds himself unable to accept the substitute because he is a robot.
It's such a brilliant mix of everything, personally I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I know I'm probably too old to like that sort of stuff but I watch anything me if the trailer looks good, I'm more into CGI/animation movies, there's soo much more that they can do compared to live-action and if Astro Boy had been live-action then it wouldn't have been as good because they wouldn't have been able to accomplish half the stuff they did in the CGI version, hell I don't even know how they managed with the live-action series back then :S But seriously, if this is your kind of movie, don't listen to what the bad reviews are telling you, experience it for yourself and just watch it, because it is a really fun/thrilling movie that can really make you smile, just as it did with me :)  Another good thing is that they haven't changed anything too drastically, normally when a movie is adapted from TV or a book they tend to change it, sometimes too much but I feel that they have changed it only slightly so that it appeals greater to our modern ages, the great thing though is that Astro is the same.. you know, same name, look, even the undies... but at least he's wearing clothes.. well up until the end... ha ha :D Although I'm not really sure what to think about the new characters apart from the RRF who are just hilarious, but I guess some of the others resemble or remind me of the old ones but the one in particular is Cora, who is mean't to be seen as a potential love interest for Astro (I think...) is just not needed really, I mean she's probably there just to fill up the space, I don't think there's an actual reason, I mean I can't see them getting together and stuff... but maybe that's just me.
Folks seem to like this film but then I've heard that IQ's have been dropping so that might say something as well.
The only drawback I feel this movie has is the somewhat out of place voice acting of some of the main characters, it seems that the producers wanted the film to be attached to some big name actors rather then finding voice actors that would suit the specific characters,specifically I felt that Bill Nighy voice was out of place as the Professor and perhaps Nic Cage could have brought more energy to the role.
I barely watched a show now and then when I was a kid (I'm 36 years old... too young for Astroboy), so I wasn't really aware of the story.
So I thought, well, this development has to be a fluke inherited from the original story, from then on it should go downhill... but it did NOT.
And then there is a little science fiction, mathematics, philosophy and somewhat TRON-ish fantasy.
If you find the basic premise even only mildly intriguing then this is a highly recommended watch.
From our hero's perspective, he is at first confused, then exhilarated as he is lifted into the three-dimensional world.
Square, who then postulates other worlds with both less and more dimensions.
Just another little well meaning cog then!
Pretty depressing stuff but then, that's what we do best and that's the way things are.
The relentlessly grim tone doesn't make for a top viewing experience then, but this is still a relevant and interesting story that serves as great food for thought.
The film doesn't try to go far afield from simply telling the facts of the composer's life, but then it really doesn't have to: the true story is vastly interesting.
Witcboard scared me then, and Ghostwatcher scared me now.
But if hauntings scare you, then see this movie.
until then, enjoy this movie for what it is, a fun, low budget, horror movie!
And then follow up with a sequel.
Even the finale itself became kind of predictable because by then you are conditioned not to have any hope.
I would only recommend this film if your only other entertainment option was watching paint dry, and even then you would had to tick me off really bad.
Where it falls apart for me is the introduction of the pseudo-intellectual ghost-hunter more interested in selling gear and a lot of paranormal mishmash, none of which makes sense or is close to the real thing, but then for the sake of story-telling, film-makers rarely care about keeping it real.
Anyway, if you are a horror movie buff, then watch it just because.
This is a total stranger that was under the impression she is there to sell equipment to a customer, then is greeted by a confrontational customer.
It's a little surprising to me, and then to have people say that this was watchable or even great and to talk down to previous entries in the horror genre is a little perplexing.
Pitt is perfect as the cocky young detective Mills, mixing together the right amount of bravado and testosterone at the start of the film, and then later tempering that swagger with cynicism Â and fear Â as the movie progresses forward.
If you're not easily bothered by graphic horror and gore, then go watch this film.
Chaplin's tramp would have handled the situation differently; PRETENDING to curry the man's favour, but then kicking him or otherwise defeating him.
I then heard a CNET radio segment on the film and decided it might be kind of interesting after all.
If you don't know anything about Linux or Open Source, but are interested in the topics, then you will really like Revolution OS.
If you are looking for an intelligent documentary about something pretty important, then you will definitely like Revolution OS.
If you are looking for some sort of super-technical film about how to write software or how and why obscure software patches were created, then this film is not for you.
A whole generation has passed since then, and there is a new wave of techniques and tools available to the filmmaker of the nineties.
Directed by William Wellman with a script by Ben Hecht, Nothing Sacred is more topical today than it was then.
Instead of judging everything by today's enlightened standards, I prefer to notice that yes, things were different in the past and then move on to the wonderful, witty script, the very modern topic, the great performances, the early, muted color, Lombard's outfits, the old airplane and the scenes of New York as it was in all its glory in the 1930s.
She had it all and then she was gone.
That style of acting was pretty normal back then - and widely accepted as "correct".
There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to "expect the unexpected" from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead.
The film then follows her rise to international celebrity trumpeted by Oliver's newspaper, the Mayor's office, and other interested parties.
Jack Welch's fortress, Rockefeller Center, looked then just like it looks now.
This then leads to another murder scene in which a lawyer has bled to death, although the murderer didn't actually use the knife; he made the lawyer do it.
We are then treated to a mini-cooking show, with instructions on how to prepare stuffed duck and baked apples.
The virus, which is the representation of America in the film, starts out in the host, and then quickly spreads throughout the building, much like American culture does in Canadian society.
Nicholas begins to vomit up leech like creatures that then start to bite & infect the other residents of Starline Tower who in turn go on a violent, sexual deviant rampage as the strange disease carried by these grotesque parasites spreads rapidly through Starline Tower.
Cronenberg throws in all sorts of everyday metaphors & messages as you would expect, the perils of sleeping around (you may get a parasite which will then possibly go on to infect the entire population of Earth!
Much under rated this movie wastes no time in getting going, so far so fast in fact that with the knickers showing, then nude teen girl getting killed so vigorously before we know what is going on, a most uncomfortable start.
And then, he cuts his own throat.
And then, after all the fun is over at home, why not take a drive to Montreal?
He then cuts his own throat with a scalpel.
Once infected, the victims - male and female, young and old alike - spread the plague to others, who then vomit blood and bugs all over the place.
As more and more of the residents become infected, Roger attempts to at first destroy the creatures, then contain the situation, and eventually, when the block is finally completely over-run by sex-mad 'zombies', escape from the island.
He'll go along with the phony jail break, but he plans to hook up with his old girl friend, Meg Dixon (Barbara Payton), cut a deal of his own with Mr. Big, then vamoose to Mexico with Meg and as much money, good or bad, that he can fool everyone out of.
But then we have things such as Doctor Doolittle, Mandingo and The Jazz Singer.
I had the pleasure of playing Darell in the movie(drug dealer in the opening scenes) First: what a great experience to work with that cast and crew, no matter how many times I fell, jumped, got shot, sped out, ate arms, got smothered by a pack of zombies, and snorted powdered sugar for cocaine, and then hear..let's do it again!
I still think Darell should have come back again....but then again I am Bias...  Dean N. Arevalo(Darell)
I could only bring myself to sit through half of this movie, then I couldn't take the pain any longer.
How plausible is it that one of the male characters would have extensive knowledge of the title character's history and that he would then, conveniently, release this information as needed?
says something like, "With all due respect, if you can point that gun somewhere else" then... watch for it, he actually mouths the other actor's line.
Bottom Line: If you haven't had the opportunity to see Seven yet then you must at least rent it.
The story surrounds the hunt for a serial killer, who, inspired by Dante Alighieri's seven deadly sins from "The Divine Comedy", sets out to, "preach" about man's impurity, and does so by targeting victims, then torturing them by pitting their own underlining sins against them.
If you are a homosexual, then this film will make you feel great about who you are and your history.
If you are not, then this film will certainly open your eyes as to what it means to be a gay or lesbian man or woman in the world today.
As Murakami, the rookie, Toshiro Mifune internalizes his usual intensity and lets his eyes and expressions convey his growing sense of shame and horror when his pistol is used first in a robbery and then again in an even worse crime.
Watch the show, first, then watch the documentary to savor it.
But then Sato gives the girl a cigarette and she sucks on it as if her last breath was coming, smoking almost the whole cigarette in 30 seconds.
Mifune, a greenhorn homicide detective, has his gun pinched on a bus-ride home from target practice; the remainder of the movie finds him searching for his missing pistol, first undercover as a homeless veteran and then under the tutelage of Takashi Shimura's Detective Sato.
Murakami, as he explains, almost snapped but chose the righteous path and became a cop; Yusa became a petty thief and then a murderer.
After the rain comes a warm summer day where the murder is caught while birds are chripping, flowers are growing and things feel more lively then when the heat wave was in effect.
There was always a surprise around the corner, whether one of pace or image or sound or performance or turn of the narrative - though in fact it's a very straightforward story, told in a linear fashion, but that description really doesn't do justice to a sequence such as when we go to the ballistics lab at the police station, Mifune learns about a bullet found at the scene of a crime, and then he dashes off without any warning - and we follow him - to a shooting range at which we'd seen him early on in the film, retrieving a spent bullet of his own, and then we dash back to the ballistic lab, and then go into a microscopic close-up POV ballistics man, comparing the two bullets.
If you read this '49 thriller, or action drama, as a noir, then it's the most respectable noir ever; as original and ingenious, formally, as Welles', but much more ambitious; yes, the most ambitious noir ever conceived and executed.
Have a long way to go then, but life will put his hand to a noble and brilliant detective Satori.
Then a woman who buys it becomes ill, and when the dress is hanging out to dry after washing (apparently she barfed on it) it blows away and ends up in the hands of a young woman who lives with an eccentric painter, who is then set upon by a deranged ticket taker from a train, a bus driver, and then gives up the dress to send to Africa, but it's of course snagged by someone else who cleans it up, trims it a bit, and it ends up on this young lady who also ends up on this train with the deranged ticket taker, who then stalks her to her remote home while her parents are away, etc.
When a pickpocket specialist, played by one of the very best Japanese character actors Takashi Shimura, comes into being his partner on the case, then things, then the plot starts to thicken further.
Following the credits, the director delivers a clinic on the art of montage, utilizing quick nonlinear cutting that makes the narrative get straight to the point: ashamed rookie cop (an impossibly young Toshiro Mifune) explaining to his boss that he lost his gun; then a jump back to earlier in the day during target practice; then a quick cut to a scene on a crowded city bus in which the Colt gets lifted.
The sailor later explains away the theory to the other singer, who seems friendlier to him, and then the whole murder theory is just dropped as if it were a mistake.
Reciting all the movie's flaws but then giving them a pass for no reason at all, straining to conjure and contrive tidbits that are supposedly worth watching, or engaging in speculative, wishful thinking that edited scenes or "possible explanations" exist that, like magic, would somehow make sense of this mess, only compounds the waste of time and money from a film like this and, even worse, contributes to the impression that moviegoers are suckers.
They then set sail on what is a most turgid voyage.
Throughout the movie, you'll continue to wait for a coherent plot, then at the end, a surprise ending that will leave you feeling empty.
Periodically the story seems to be about to make sense but then it falls apart again as the characters do something else seemingly unmotivated or poorly motivated.
Notice the double standard of Kensit's character as she first has sex with a man (in exchange for something she expects but never gets) & then disapproves her friend's (Hurley's) going a bit "too far" after their burlesque dance routine.
One of the tenets of Bruce's life and career was that he would be truthful to himself, or at least would have that urge to find the truth early on (during his pre-beat years of the 50's) and then full-blown in the late 50's and especially early 60's.
The cutting is often startling, skipping along to that jazzy beat that is laid onto the soundtrack (I loved one scene where they show a early 50's party at a 'pad', records being played, grass being rolled, Bruce falling head over heels in a quiet way), and then with the comedy clips especially, we get the best and the worst of what Bruce had to offer, his peak in pointing out things with risquÃ© abandon (and ended up getting him in ridiculous trouble), and downfall into drugs and depression.
Of course there is a chase, but there is less action then most of the other shorts.
Clive Owen has the opportunity to portray a different side to the driver then in the previous films, allowing his normally unflappable character to have an emotional moment beyond what we've seen.
He then laments what he has witnessed in the 15 wars he is covered by telling of the dying people that have that died at his feet begging for help.
He then says he wishes on of his pictures would help change something so all the time he has dedicated to his career are worth something.
It is a Dirty Dozen-style shoot'em'up action film that ends up not very spectacular at all (although there are some scenes on top of a moving train that is reminiscent of 1983's Octopussy) and tries to be poignant now and then, humorous failing with every attempt.
If all of that is enough to do it for you, then I suggest you have at The Inglorious Bastards.
Back then you could only watch bloodbaths in orange, here the blood is really realistic.
The film then follows the group as they negotiate their way to Switzerland, and end up becoming involved with a plan to steal a valuable weapon from a German train.
They encounter a series of obstacles along the way, but then they accidentally kill a squadron of American soldiers dressed in Nazi uniforms for a specific mission.
If 'words' are indeed 'power', then here in this film for all to see was a MAGNET of a man, a beacon.
Sure, it's 'dark', but then, so too is life, so honesty comes forth once again.
Well then, where's Natassja Kinski when you need her?
usually, if a movie is really really awful...as bad as "ax 'em" (2002) per say, then i find something redeeming about the fact that it is absurdly lacking any quality that might suggest an iota of professionalism.
Beautifully shot, absorbing film about the close-knit Tucker clan - Sam (Zachary Scott), the handsome dad who loves being a farmer, Nona (Betty Field), a good wife and mother who always seems to look well-groomed in spite of her hard work, two really cute kids, and then there's ornery old Granny (Beulah Bondi), she of the sharp tongue and stubborn will.
The maiden's pounding heart suddenly skipped a beat, as the wolf was abruptly distracted by a sleek black raven, who flew teasingly close, then quickly retreated to a nearby tree branch.
The raven, unwilling to go unnoticed, fluttered brazenly close to the wolf, then gently came to rest on his soft gray shoulder, and they would lie together...wolf and raven...drawing around themselves...the sleek blackness of the raven's mystery...and the unexpected gallantry of the lone wolf.
But if you do, then it's genius......  And look for some nice metaphors which are a honor to Sergio Leone.
So then "decent people could enjoy this beautiful country".
No wonder, then, that ordinary people do not go to theaters to see this movies, much less to see films such low value free of any film and ethical value.
Recap: Lamont Dixon is a former fire fighter that saw his best friend being killed in a fire and then switched job.
You need to switch the battleship with an oilrig and then it almost seems like an identical copy.
On the positive side, Jane Seymour is much better then Ali McGraw in every aspect.
I've given it 2, but even then I find it hard to justify such a high mark.
then added on a more thoughtful note, "and have an open mind."
And then there's Helen Hunt, I don't care what other people say, she is a great actress and people who say she's not feminine are just plain crazy.
And then there is Greg Kinnear, who also does a great job.
Even then, don't come knocking.
Even then, don't knock.
He then meets a waitress (Helen Hunt) and his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and they all form a friendship with each other.
But then the movie becomes another one of those dangerous romantic fantasies where an unlikable guy is "cured" of his xenophobia by the love of a good woman.
At the beginning the racist, sexist, and homophobic jokes made by Nicholson are played for laughs, which is fine for the movie's purposes, but then Brooks expects us to feel threatened by the exact same type of comments and then warmhearted when he tries to change his ways.
Hunt and Nicholson falling in love is an easy out because then Brooks doesn't really have to deal with the more difficult (and more interesting) ideas brought up in the first half.
If a Hollywood movie is just leaning upon its cast, why watching Hollywood then?
He uses a bar of soap once and then throws it out.
We do not like to be bothered unless we are bored, or tired, in which case we want to communicate with the outside world for a brief period of time, then after one hour or so we want to go back inside ourselves again and be left alone.
He then intrudes in the couple's conversation again, noticing the food on their table, saying "Obviously your appetites aren't as big as your noses."
This movie deserved all of its Oscars, and then some.
Writing a review of it seems to be a waste of time but I've already wasted 90 minutes of my life watching it so if I can stop other people from doing the same then it was worth it.
He shoots it in black and white and uses a documentary style approach by interviewing Bruces wife, mother and agent and then flashing to those scenes.
Night of the Scarecrow deserves more recognition then it gets.It's got a good storyline and plot to it.Theres no characters that are that famous,but if you watch soap opears you'll recognize Cristi Harris who plays "Stephanie".She's from NBCs Sunset Beach.The killer Scarecrow is corny ,like the snowman in Jack Frost,but it's still a great movie.It also has great death scenes;so if you like horror movies rent Night of the Scarecrow,you won't be disappointed.I give it **** out of ***** stars.
Not many people have heard of this, but still give it a go because it is much better then some of the other horror movies out there.
It may be worth a watch for Horror fanatics(like myself), but even then I would have trouble recommending it, and it's badly made and written as well, plus Gary Lockwood played his role extremely well as the prick of a Mayor!.
Prime example, in the beginning after Lucy returned from Narnia as she re-entered the wardrobe, the character specifically knew that she had been gone for apparently hours, so as she re-enters, the first thing she does is to shout out to everyone who inevitably will be worried about her, that she's OK. After they question her, she then realistically asks, "wait, what?
She first begins to use it, but then is told by Susan that it's too late, implying that since he's already dead, the potion would do no good since it's meant to heal injuries only.
If my only major gripe about a 2 hour+ movie is the non-use of a Phoenix Down on a fallen Red XIII, then it's a pretty good movie.
I don't remember exactly what I said about the movie back then, but I'm pretty sure that some strong words, like "sucked," were thrown around.
To see him perform as a faun in this and then watch him in "The Last King of Scotland" in one of the most powerful roles I've ever seen is amazing.
I then dutifully purchased the DVD, as I have always purchased "new" Lenny Bruce recording or, lately videos, never tiring of his delivery or his message.
This movie was full of boring clichÃ©s, idiotic dialogue, boring scenes of nothing, then too fast scenes where actions take place so fast you can not be sure exactly what is happening and why.
The main being the ending seen of all the kids grown up then going through the wardrobe again as children.
Disney did the book great justice and then some.
The child actors are definitely comfortable in their roles and while I saw glimpses of the children of the aforementioned V. C. Andrews Gothic novel, they are real people: The younger ones fare better than the older ones, but then again they are on screen more and their stories are more crucial than the older ones although all four eventually converge into the climactic battle sequence.
If you are familiar with the story, then there are no real surprises, but makes up for it with incredible CGI animation.
Overall an excellent family film and if you are a fan of the Harry Potter franchise then you should be able to dig this quite easily.
Now then, if you are just dying to see soft porn (with no storyline, just the sex), this is certainly a good choice, for it is plastered with wall-to-wall nudity and sexuality.
But if you like seeing the hardcore stuff, then hey that's your taste.
How can a movie be so stupid, so unbelievably stupid, as to have Heather Thomas in a major role, then not give her more screen time??
If you do like goofy movies from the 80s, then I recommend this one.
However, if you want a good movie with solid acting, then do not rent this.
The film was PG and then they added some boobies to make it rated R. Today, Solaris was given an R just for showing George Clooney's liberal behind (it was later revoked to PG-13).
Back then, producers knew that kids wanted to see large, oval shaped tater tots and kids drinking and going bonkers.
Only when Rossiter gets revived in the last third and begins brutally torturing the ladies does this flick finally start cooking, but by then it's too little too late to alleviate the general tedium.
I saw this film during it's initial release in the theaters but have only seen it twice since then.
It would take all the best doctors in the east to save this movie and, even then, I doubt it could be anything more than something to separate channel 357 from 359.
The first thing that struck me was the bad effect's in the opening scenes but then I saw that it was computer generated graphics and not CGI in a time when Windows 95 was the hottest OS.
Watching the opening minutes of the film worried me that this film would retreat into itself rather then expand in the so many aspects in which it actually did.
The situation then become complicated by Nugent's appearance before a high-school class as speaker, an event at which Margaret's daughter falls in love with him despite or because of the difference in their ages.
It is frequently as good as its award-winning screenplay would lead one to expect it would be, and then some.
She says hello to him while he looks totally confused - and then there is pounding at his door.
The movie is original in idea, but had the same formula and end results for the productions made back then (and a few right now).
But then again, I think most of France has a cigarette lit.
Their particular hustle involves getting properties condemned by trashing them or infecting them with rats or some other vermin, forcibly throwing out squatters or tenants, then buying the property on the cheap, and then finally selling it at a nice profit.
And then there is an old piano teacher that Tom happens to run into one day who invites him to an audition.
But of course playing the piano at that level is not something you can take up, let go, and then go back to.
The first of those was quite early on, and I thought that the film was going to pull itself together and turn into something really good; but she disappeared then until another short scene quite close to the end.
When he runs into his mother's former concert manager, (Sandy Whitelaw) he asks for the opportunity for an audition, then engages a petite Chinese piano teacher Miao Lin (Linh-Dan Pham) to assess his abilities.
It never is easy, then again, life never is to begin with.
Now, ten years later, Thomas, at twenty-eight, is little more than a professional punk whose job appears to be investing in shady real estate deals then using underhanded and sometimes even violent methods to evict those who cannot pay their rents or mortgages.
Wisely, the film rarely makes moral judgments about the character; it merely records his activities, then allows us to size him up based on what we see.
he is invited for an audition and since then his life is filled with his passionate pursuit of his dream.
Emmanuelle Devos is his dad's new girlfriend, whom Tom first calls a whore and rejects and then wants to hire on to calm things on the home front.
This is a pretty good Western, from an expert in the field (Hathaway) â immeasurably aided by its star cast (Gary Cooper, Susan Hayward, Richard Widmark, Hugh Marlowe and Cameron Mitchell), a compelling plot line (three adventurers help a woman save her husband, trapped in a mine, then fight over her and the coupleâs gold), the pleasant Widescreen photography (the format was still a new fad at the time), and a magnificent score (courtesy of the great Bernard Herrmann).
The supporting cast, then, includes only one prominent role for a Mexican â yet another member of the group who, in defiance of the Indian onslaught, expires in a hail of arrows â whereas young Rita Morenoâs saloon singer proves to be the only other female character in the film.
It was a good call on the part of the filmmakers to not show the furious natives until near the end and then only show brief glimpses.
With lovely locations in Mexico this was Fox's first western in the then new process of Cinemascope and Stereophonic sound and boasted a top notch cast in Gary Cooper, Susan Hayward and Richard Widmark.
But with elements of drama combined, I was confused when the movie continually lapsed into comedy, then back to tragedy.
I loved it then and I still love it today.
Okay, one of my favorites... Cary Grant and Irene Dunne lose a baby...then adopt a baby only to nearly lose her in a court battle...then SHE DIES...they nearly divorce...and then (finally) they get the blue-eyed blonde baby boy they'd initially requested from the adoption agency and (presumably) live happily ever after.
It's like hitting some cute furry animal and then standing there.. watching it... you'd know whats coming.
They then decide to adopt a child, but not without difficulty.
Then, they adopt a baby who makes it to about age six or seven and then dies after a quick illness.
The cinematography is wonderful, the acting is great, and if you think seeing another film of this genre is close to torture, then you really should see what Carl Thibault has created, breathing fresh, new life into the genre.
Beulah Bondi (who played George Bailey's mother from It's A Wonderful Life) has a great supporting role as the head of the adoption agency who has doubts about the couple at first, but then grows to care a great deal for them.
I can't see anyone else better for his movie then these people.
There are eventually going to be out on the street then what?
It was apparent as shown in the film that Eddie as he was known then was feeling that the anatomy given at birth was not matching what was felt inside.
I personally thought Mr. Thibault was an older gentleman, with more years of personal life experience to draw upon, as he was able to depict in his writing and directing, more realism then most big name writers and directors with "Major credits" show in their movies.
The docu-drama of the challenges faced by the United States in breaking the sound barrier and then the astronaut selection process.
And then just to make sure we know it's really Bill Conti's score, and not Pete Tchaikovsky, he changes two notes.
When objects fly in the movie, they are seen this way: here it comes (from the left), there it goes (to the left), here it comes (from below), there it goes (off the bottom), now it wobbles (to show how fast it's going), the dials on the instrument panel turn, then out the front window, now where did it go?, now it's coming right at you, and last just the vapor trail seen from the ground.
We see Dennis Quaid's cocky pilot saying he's the best their is, and then another where he suddenly becomes like 12 years old in front of the female doctor as she speaks/laughs with his wife behind doors.
We see Ed Harris' John Glenn as the supposed spokesperson of the group, the "Dudley Do-Right" as it were, but then the slightest bit of uncertainty - not to mention a really well told drama with his wife, who was a stutterer, and stood up against being pressured by Vice President Johnson.
Basically any scene with Chuck Yeagher is one of these, especially early on but then also towards the end with his absolutely stunning bittersweet moment of going up to the sky and, well, nearly dying in a last-minute jump from the plane into flames.
It is well-written and well-acted, featuring a veritable `Who's Who' of then slightly unknown actors such as Ed Harris, Dennis Quaid, Sam Shepard, Scott Glenn and Lance Henriksen.
One thing I particularly enjoyed about the film was the introduction of Chuck Yeager (Shepard) and his contribution to history by breaking the sound barrier, and then the periodic simultaneous comparison of the accomplishments of the astronauts and the Air Force and civilian test pilots, as well as exhibiting their eventual mutual respect.
Since then, I periodically search Amazon.com in the hope that some company will have put it into DVD format.
Left to fend for himself, he is then taken in by the dolphins who live in the river and protect their human charge from predators as they would their own calves.
Some years later, when Lazaro is about ten or so, he is then found and brought to the city where his father's mentor vows to care for him and make him civilised.
But when I see a drama and the story or events are so gripping that I get involved with the characters and cry for them and with them, then that is a really good movie.
And if a movie can make me share a character's despondency and weep for a while, then that it is a GREAT movie.
I am tempted to buy this movie, but then, I don't see why I should since one viewing seems to have grafted these images onto my very soul.
The problem was when after finishing seeing the movie i went back and saw the first minutes, and then... oh boy did i cried.
It's tragic enough to see the loss of the mother on the son, but then to hide it from the little girl becomes a greater challenge.
I was thinking of rating it a 9 just because it was a bit short in length but then again I thought that it was that good that I wanted more.
You forget that it's just drawings one after another, and then you see something so breathtaking and you realise why the creators decided to make this an anime.
The creators don't even try to present the then Japanese empire as something magnificent, on the contrary.
Pillow shots are utilized greatly in this movie; that means that a scene will be played out, and then there will be static shots of scenery (not necessarily have to be stunningly beautiful), but it gives the audience some time to contemplate on what happened.
The film opens, and then you have a narration heard over head, that goes like this...  "In 1945, on the night of September 21, I died."
Since then I canÂ´t get this heartbreaking story out of my head.
I'd grow up with Naussica and cartoons, and had just seen Akira, then my brother and I rented this.
We sat through the whole thing without saying a word, then when the movie was over we didn't even talk.
However, every now and then an animated film comes along that extends it's boundaries and manages to deliver a very adult story, and Grave of the Fireflies is one of those films.
He then has to take care of his 4 year old sister(Setsuko).
He then ends up on the street and the struggle begins...
At the end of the movie, there was silence, absolute and total silence in the theater - and then, only an occasional sniffle until the end credits had finished rolling and the house lights came up.
You find yourself hoping that things will go right now for Setsuko and Seita, and then the knowledge that ultimately it won't undercuts you with real emotional power.
If you're turned off by the backbiting and Macchiavellian manipulation on such shows as Survivor or Big Brother, but the idea of a group of people competing for a big prize appeals to you, then you really should try this program.
Right from the get go you know your in la la land when the rangers jump out of a Hercules transport at dawn somewhere over the mideast, but then after a water landing they surface in the dark!
Since then, the endless love story set in the 19th century Paris has inspired both opera writers and movie directors.
Hong Kong Chinese were then not very familiar with Western culture, the cinema staff had even misplaced PlÃ¡cido Domingo's name as "Domingo PlÃ¡cido" on the billboard.
Now if it's true that Warner Brothers DID pull this from circulation because it might be seen as culturally insensitive, then the people responsible for this are total idiots.
It would touch on elements, and then discard them, and when it did explore them, it was so superficial it was like hearing a good joke told by someone with no timing.
It was atmospheric and, perhaps most successfully of all, captured something of the allure that draws us to works of art and that then makes some people steal them--the latter a sort of perverse commentary on the intangible something about great art that makes us value it so highly.
By the way, IF the film had been the same up until she met the jerk and then fell in love with a WORTHY man, then this could have been a wonderful film about a young lady choosing an arranged marriage or listening to her own needs.
And then there are the pointless changes in the other characters.
When you watching "Davitelj" you laugh, then you scream, and so on.
There are some episodes that got little to do with the main story but then there are some where the main story eats up even the opening theme.
I think the best way to begin this would be not to thank but to bear hug,the creative geniuses who created this piece of art..i mean everything about this show is f**king perfect-the characters,the plot,the direction,the music,the screenplay,the script..Its a perfect example of when all the things come together to make something that is larger than the creators themselves..I don't know how i stumbled across the page of cowboy bebop but it must have one my lucky days..I have to say i was not intrigued from the plot as much as from the characters,which i read about in the comments..my expectations from the show were pretty low despite the rating but man when i watched its first two episodes,even the 9.4 rating seemed an insult..and IT IS THAT GOOD..you would filled with awe for its creators after you watch it..you would even love the cowboy bebop sign that comes in between the show..The best thing about the show is that is has no specific genre,or you can say its a genre in itself..i wont have the slightest doubt if the show gets a cult status..so you never know whats gonna come out in the next scene,whether you will be convulsing with laughter or staring at the screen in empathy for one of the characters..as the show goes on and on,you keep on going deep into the skin of the characters..you don't know when it happens that the characters just occupy a permanent space in your head..you start to wish that they are always around..with a bored spike smoking his cigarette,jet watering his plants ,sulky faye with her frown and industrious ed jumping around with his laptop..and when the show ended,i actually felt a part of my life going away..and i bet you will feel the same way when the show ends..you will stare into the eyes of spike and say " no this is not going to happen,i wont let you go"..its a rare feeling for someone in real life but its almost impossible for someone in reel life..  so my respect to shinichiro wantanbe from the bottom of my heart for directing the show so perfectly and congratulations to hajami yatate for writing something so perfect in itself..and kobayashi and yoko kanno,no man i ain't forgetting them either..the show wouldn't have been complete without their music which encompasses everything from jazz to metal to blues to country to electronic..I urge everyone who reads this comment to watch this show..doesn't matter if you're not an anime fan..this show is apiece of art and it must not be missed..and if you're an anime fan,then you wont be seeing something as great as this in a long time..i guess if you take my word,then you're in for one of your luckiest days of your life..  SEE YOU IMDb COWBOY..
There is no excuse for the absurd racial stereotypes by then, at least in Hollywood; but then the whole movie is nothing but stereotypes, so I guess it is an equal opportunity offender.
But then they become bad actors in a bad B quality movie.
But then again, good film-making/animations transcends all cultures.
Next, several story arcs were at first hinted at, then truly converged and were resolved by series' end.
That aspect of showing us one thing then moving on to the other then returning to it is one of the reasons why the show is so great.
Admitidly, not everyone can understand a certain anime, which means then you'd have to see it right from the start, or you'll be bored to death.
And if that doesn't convince you, then nothing will.  
And then there's "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man," "Bill," and "Make Believe."
It starts out as a typical chicks in prison movie then when they get bored of that it becomes a 'buddy movie'.
When I heard this was made in 1995, I was at first surprised and then understanding.
But then Amiro is not a normal kid.
The film is called "The runner" as Amiro's running ability is underlined three times in the filmÂfirst he runs behind the train and wins a psychological race over his peers, then he runs after a cyclist who tries to avoid paying him for the cool water and catches up with him, and finally running with a block of ice that he has bought while others try to rob him of it, against a backdrop of oil fires.
But then aren't we all "runners" of some sort in real life?
It was a British film and I knew then immediately that I had to see it for that reason alone.
Most of the film seems to consist of each character walking about in the dark for a bit, and then getting killed.
If you like this then be sure to get hold of Dog Soldiers which is even better.
The plot, such as it is, is that a group of teens decide to have some fun with a ouija board but inadvertently raise an evil Djinn, who then sets about killing them all in gruesome ways.
And every bad horror-movie clichÃ© is relentlessly churned out, then used again for good measure, and again, and again.
So, tentatively, Chad walks down the corridor, slowly at first, then building up a little as he nears the door.
These spirits then hunt all the kiddies down and kill them one by one.
The idea was interesting and the movie was OK at the beginning, then it goes downhill.
If you enjoy movies like this, then I'm sure you will enjoy Long Time Dead.
Long Time Dead opens to a caption that informs us that we're in 'Morocco 1979' where a group of people are holding a sÃ©ance which gets out of hand when a fire demon called a Djinn appears & supposedly kills everyone... Long Time Dead then cuts to present day London where four house-mates, Rob (Joe Absolom), Liam (Alex Newman), Webster (Lukas Haas) & Stella (Lara Belmont) are planning to go out for the night.
Don't spend any sort of money on it but if you can catch it on TV for free & there's nothing else on then it's probably just about worth an hour & a half of your time, but only just.
If don't have the preconception that you are going to watch an extremely clever horror and are just looking for a back to basics horror then you should enjoy this.
I could only stand about 15 minutes of it, and then hurried up to fast-forward to the part with Shearer, which was bad as well.
Unless you want to see guns going off without discharges flying out, bad acting, stunt doubles of a different color then the main star, or just how cool Gary Daniels is.
As usual Gary proves able to sculpt a sympathetic protagonist who is able to win over the audience into rooting for him regardless of the sometimes violent methods he uses to defeat his foes and here his vengeance against the criminal fraternity who destroyed his family and friends is nothing short of apocalyptic.As well as the superb physical skills that Gary brings to his performances he is capable of portraying strong human emotions also.He is always very effective indeed in scenes involving children and it can be no accident that he is often cast as a father in his films.Martial arts are absent from this tale until the final thirty minutes and when they finally appear in a series of brutal and superbly well choreographed fights you realise that you are watching a master at work.There are simply no current screen martial arts stars (Chinese,European or American)who could have brought what Gary Daniels brings to this role.This is a movie that should be sought by anyone who professes to enjoy action and if they enjoyed it half as much as I did then it won't be long before they seek out other Gary Daniels movies.They won't be disappointed,if anyone working in this genre delivers the kind of energy that Gary Daniels does in every role then they are being very quiet about it.Keep the British flag flying Gary for there isn't any young actor in the UK today who looks as if they even have the strength to even lift the flag up.Only the US is capable of producing a movie like RECOIL and long may they continue.
The camera ogles that view for about 5 seconds and then cuts immediately to Denning with a HUGE smile on his face!
Penny then gives Dave her doll Henrietta.
The background involves the deportation of Frank Buchanan (Michael Granger), an American gangster who vows revenge and finances a not so mad German scientist (Gregory Gaye) who is developing a process (based on then trendy radioactivity) to animate dead bodies.
It's definitely a B-movie, but that didn't mean "bad" back then.
Back then, I loved the characters (especially Steelbeak and Darkwing himself), the majority of the story lines and the good IL' classic Disney feel that somehow lacks in today's Disney shows.
There still life in this bird yet and with the Scrooge McDuck universe still popular to this day then we might just see him return some time.
The fact that every tableaux (the little stories in the movie) give us just a hint of what's going on, for then move to a new story explains that the director does not mean to agreed people nor to judge subjects being approached, necessarily.
Unless your thoughts can not go as far, then you will just think it was a waste of time maybe.
The part where the naked women appears to be really old, then her naked body reveals a young beautiful women said a lot to me.
It made me wonder what if something like this actually happened, then the court room scene really made me laugh.
This movie is definitely not normal, it is really a bunch of shorts put together, each transition is just a character followed to another scene and can at times seem confusing; because its right when that short climax's and you are about to find out, and then it switches and you are on to the next one.
Phantom of Liberty for the most part is quite a normal film with a structured narrative and some quite well defined characters What makes it brilliant is the fact that one minute, its just a normal film and then a scene where a family sit at a table on toilet seats is thrown at us.
The film then moves to present day France, and a man giving postcards to children, who he tells, don't show them to adults.
Other memorable scenes include one where guests sit on toilets at a dinner table, then ask to go to a small cubicle to eat on their own.
His handcuffs are then removed by police, who shake his hand, and outside a gathering of people ask for his autograph.
They arrive there and find her in class, the school register is read out, and she replies, then they take her to the police station.
The police sergeant then questions the young girl about her height, weight, and so on, then calls an officer in and tells him to look all over the city for this girl, the officer then replies "Can I take her with me?".
And if they are no laws at all, then they are no causal relations.
And if there are no causal relations, then form and function vanish, exactly like in Bunuel's movie.
Much of this sequence is rather serious, dealing with a young man's lusting for an older woman, the rousings and thoughts of the old priests...and then it suddenly, finally, breaks up the tension with an S&M gag!
It opens in Toledo during the Napoleonic occupation then jumps to the modern day Paris.
Instead of being grateful for her amazing opportunity and letting the old bird show her off for a few hours and then quitting ballet the next day, she had to embarrass her.
In the end I think someone else wrote Miles (Columbus Short) and then they hired a fifteen year old girl wannabe dancer to write the rest of the movie.
What person would order these exercises and then open the window and let all their many, many papers blow across the office and yet continue exercising?!
This sort of extreme and stupid behavior continued from then on, such as when they went out to eat at a vegetarian restaurant, go for long, long walks in the middle of pouring rain and talk on and on and on (ad nauseum) about "right living and exercise".
Now if this wasn't bad enough, about midway through the film, Maizie re-appeared and then the film's romance between the leads was completely derailed.
But then Reginald Denny who has a jealous wife dumps Dorothea back on George who with Jean has to put up with her incompetence.
George Brent, as Fred Gilbert, is similarly untested in this film (as in most of his films) but is in the additionally unfortunate position of providing the comedy in the romance, initially through his health regime obsession and then his superficial attraction to Maizie (Dorothea Kent), (the latter also being the means by which an essentially simple story is sufficiently prolonged to allow a feature length gap between the boy meets girl beginning and the inevitable - this is 1930's romantic comedy - boy gets girl ending).
If you like 1930's Hollywood romantic comedy then this is a sweet, unassuming film, which, while not as memorable as many other films of Hollywood's golden age, is still worth a look.
Cherry then coerces him into helping save Roy from assassination, then helping the miners take back their claims by force.
I think that the direct to video release is fair in this case , the movie is not that good .I will look for his movie Chaos then with Jason Stantham.
Since his trademark series "Blade" came to a close in 2004, Wesley has been really almost hitting rock bottom since then.
Sure, we all like gunfights and explosions, but when the movie mainly contains an opening scene and then people having flashbacks of that same scene (I think I counted this happening about 3 times) then it starts to get a bit dull.
The location was a great one, the first car chase was great, fast paced and full of action, they then duplicate it towards the end.
If you're not into that sort of thing thats been done before in "Ronin" and "Ocean's Eleven" then you won't find anything different here.
the story line is so full of holes, and pointless narrative its a waste of time me even writing about it, as a snipes fan I watched this, and recently with the likes of Zig Zag, Undisputed and then Unstoppable coming from Wesley I was hoping for an upturn in quality, but yet again he failed me with this film, so poor I can't believe I wrote this much about it !
She was cute then, and she's still a very pretty woman.....and a good actress.
And if you wanna see some the HOTTEST Black and Latina models that you have ever seen then you definitely want this film.
This one has gotta be one of my favourite films, apparently this documentary started out as a film about bob Marley's funeral then ended up being something else.
Has a very spiritual feel about the whole thing, contains interviews with local inhabitants of the Look Behind area in JA, all of which are reggae lovers, gives there views on RastafarI and Bob Marley, then goes onto feature mutabaruka with plenty of interviews, also gregory Isaacs at his African Museum record label, he also gives a great performance and u can see just how he gets the name "The Cool Ruler", then onto a performance by Louie Lepke singing a song he wrote about bob marleys death.
And it didn't help that they all spoke in broken English, but then again I wasn't watching it with subtitles.
It begins with a Quentin Tarantino cameo, then switches to the story of two clans fighting over the supposed treasure in a small town.
Forgive the brevity, but if you've seen any number of spaghetti westerns then you've probably seen something like this story that spins out here.
The film then picks up in the final 40 minutes with a huge shoot out.
I don't remember when was the first time that I hear something about this film but since then and when I saw the trailer it becomes for me the film to check this year.
If you don't mind such things and seek to find somethin which is a true art piece then you have found it.
If you are a fan of Asian cinema you'll find that every character is so perfectly what you expect and then some (Im not gonna bother with spoilers cuz it plays it out for itself).
Needless to say, the squalid atmosphere peculiar to European Westerns is largely missing hereÂbut, then, neither does the film extract particular benefit from its own country's heritage!
It should have been awesome stylized action with heads rolling and arterial spray, then the bad acting, script and story could be overlooked.
Oddly, no one in the group that then heads back to the island appears to be an archaeologist or anthropologist--just a motley crew of adventurers who look nothing like the sort to investigate--particularly the slutty lady whose only interest in life is sex.
If you're happy to miss a few, then I recommend making this one of them.
The subsequent investigation leads to the discovery of an ancient artifact on the island, and then a museums' expedition to the island to explore it further.
He is killed at the end but his even more mutated son then appears, kills a man and the whole place then burns down.
Its not often you see a movie go from completely serious war film to sci fi time travel to comedy and then somehow manage to keep its war film story intact that you're anxious to see how it all ends.
While in years past they're robbed by what appears to be a common thief, but then they all realize the person is General Lee, a famous general who kept Korea from being invaded by japan.
I can't imagine this film being of particular interest to most viewers, but if you like 70s British horror, or are interested in how sex and gore have evolved over the years in horror cinema, then it may be worth catching.
So, my advice is to buy a Whitney Houston album so you can hear her fabulous voice without interference from all the foley noise, and then rent "No Way Out," which provides all sorts of motivation for the romance and sex scenes with an equally serious, but far more plausible performance from Costner.
And then there is the soundtrack, the highlight of this flick!
And then there is the music.
If you want to watch a movie with good acting and an engaging story, then this is the movie to watch.
I wasn`t expecting it to be up to much but I was shocked as to what a poor film RANGERS is  ****** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ******* But don`t worry you won`t want to see this movie  The film starts with an airborne shot of a hercules C-130 then it cuts to the interior of the plane - Which in no way resembles a C-130 , It resembles a gym changing room !
Cut to some stock footage of men skydiving from a plane at dawn and then landing into the sea where they inflate a couple of rubber dingys underwater then cut to them resurfacing where it`s pitch black !
So they carry on with their mission which confused me because if they`re posing as Syrians then that can only mean the action is taking place in Syria or the Lebanon ,neither country being at war so why`s this taking place in the middle of a war zone ?
If a real world example was ever needed, then this tired old show is surely it.
Wilde played the role for ten years, then he left, so next "third man", Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), a mad inventor.
Aldridge then left the series, so in 1990, Foggy Dewhurst returned.
The 'Compo's Funeral' episode was very touching but in my opinion, this should have been the show's final episode, ever since then, the show's quality has declined rapidly.
The only other thing offered in the past was, I think in the 90's a (then)full version for about a whopping $300.00 or $400.00.
Even then, I had never seen a single episode but was sure I'd like it.
The plots are pretty ludicrous and the situations repetitive, but the plots are based on the characters, and once you accept the premise that these elderly men are idle with their one goal in life being to resist being their ages, then their schemes, far fetched as many are, make some sort of sense.
Well then, can it be that it is a certain kind of fare that appeals strictly to the British alone?
The music plays unnoticed in the action's background - no theme remains in your mind after the end credits, no lyrical moments have flashed your ears - but then again, you didn't come see the film for its music did you?
to all you people that thought this movie was a waste of money or had no potential then i guess you have a thing for movies like "she's all that'.
In fact, I had avoided seeing it after it had screened, then after it was released on video... until my best friend and I decided to give it a whirl.
If you don't expect great things from this movie, if all you want is a decent story with some beautiful eye-candy, then this movie is great.
Bonny doesn't understand this kind of us-selfish love till it is almost too late and then in the end, finally she figures it out.
There are a few twists and surprises you might not see coming but then again you might expect it because I for one did.
Unless your a kid who wants to see Jolie featured in a graphic sex scene and without her clothes on then this is the movie for you.
The producer must have a nice sense of hummer to give his film the right title then ..........
But Julia may not be who she claims: first a private eye (Thomas Jane) shows up on behalf of Julia's sister, then the sister herself.
Every now and then an avid movie theater goer is bound to stumble upon something like this, but it still took be by surprise.
Rapid transformations from a cold blooded rascal to a passionate volcano leave the sensation more of a sitcom style parody then some subtle introspective struggle of her character.
I admit it-I am totally taken by period pieces whose setting is somewhere in Latin America and if those movies have good sets and/or locations then I am smitten.
What, then, saves this film from registering a 3 or worse on my scale?
then perhaps she is jealous - but more likely, it is a statement of rebellion against Paloma's otherwise static character type.
The movie starts off making a strong comment about the suffering of many at the hands of a small elite, and then it quickly explores an individual situation within the population.
There is a lot going on here that deals with superficial impressions, since Pedro, the Brute (played by Pedro ArmendÃ¡riz, who, as an unfortunate side note, committed suicide in 1963), is completely determined to help Don Andres but then changes his mind entirely once he gets close to the people that he is sent out to scare into submission.
He was determined at the beginning to set the troublemakers straight, but it is not until he is forced to take shelter among them that he realizes who the real troublemakers are (`I may have done something wrong but I didn't know you then.').
Brute is a strongman for the rich elite and then ends up getting help from them and even falling in love with one of them, at which point he changes his mind, no longer wanting Don Andres to have his way and for all of these people to be evicted.
Her only solace then is the ritual bath, and she seeks sexual advice from its wise attendant in order not to lose her husband.
By then it was 1947.
I would suggest that everyone should check this film themselves and then form an opinion....because in my opinion the presentation style of Kisna is something which has not been attempted in Bollywood !
This movie obviously may not appeal to everyone, but then again this movie is not for everyone.
If you love a good love story that makes you cry... then Kisna is a beautiful love story that will do just that.
Since they were kids, he always ignored her why should he talk to her as an adult then?
It seems like he wrote it, then forgot about it and then saw this girl who could do a rope dance and figuredÂOh I should put her in the film, no one has ever seen a girl doing a rope dance.
As they grow into teenagers, her militant father discovers her affections for Kisna and vice versa then chooses to send his darling daughter back to England to live to keep her from Kisna.
Isha Sharvani makes her debut and Kisna India sweetheart who gives her British counterpart a run for her money and then some as she dances her way through this film with vigorous fervor.
Honestly, if there was a negative rating, then I would have given this movie a -100 or something.
Why , then , were the stunts so long-drawn and pretentious?
then when they hit land, for some reason they dress up as hobo's while they're still carrying around M4's and Ak's, while trying to be under cover.This is soon followed by the Rangers wandering around the streets taking they're hobo-taskic costumes off, after they only had them on for about 3 minutes, you can't blame them, this film is such a steaming pile of crap I would've refused to dress like a jack-ass.
Matt Macoy then shows off his ability to shoot guns while blinking like a mad man.
Then you can see a guy who looks like Mister T on a different vehicle in a scene, then in the next scene he's on a different vehicle and then back on the first vehicle.
Period films are not for everyone, and if you lack an appreciation for subtlety then maybe something like "Joe Dirt" may be better suited for you.
I actually saw this movie when it was released in 1993, and honestly it was pretty dull then.
Also if you buy it in English the characters have different names then in the Chinese version.
But if you are a "Gods Must Be Crazy fan, then I suggest that you see this movie.
If you can get it as cheap as I did then buy it, otherwise, it's good for a rental.
This is one of those fun one's where you think you know the ending, then change your mind, then change it back, and then change it again.
holy crap.i thought this was a great movie.it is a made for TV movie,but it is better than most TV movies,and even comparable to some theatrical releases.the premise is not new,family moves into a new community after a break-in at their old house, to start a new life.things seem great in the new community,but then things start happening.i won't say anymore except that there is a psycho stalking the family.and let me tell you,this psycho is really nuts.but what really elevates this movie is the acting.which i thought was fantastic.there's also lots of tension ans suspense to keep you unnerved.this is a very entertaining movie,deserving of a higher rating than it currently has.i've seen a few TV movies of the genre and this is one of the better 1's.my vote for 'Love Thy neighbour': 9/10
If you're a woman, if you like Lifetime movies, if you're a fan of Alexandra Paul, then you should enjoy this.
But if you like these movie of the week popcorn movies, then I'd recommend this one as much as any other.
Now and then a badly made film is so incredibly inept that it becomes hilariously funny and attains cult movie status.
If not a .07 would be about correct since there is awful and then, well there is this movie.
Take a Dean Martin remove acting and singing talent then drop his IQ by about 50 points and you have Duke Mitchell.
Then take a Jerry Lewis remove anything funny about him and then raise the annoying factor up about 1000% and you have Sam Petrillo.
This movie showcases Mitchell and Petrillo and for the life of me i don't know why they were not more popular.Being clones of Martin and Lewis,they come off as quite professional in this B- Movie.Songs are good and i like this movie better than any "road" movies but then thats a matter of taste or lack of it.Bela Lugosi and the Ape actors just add to the fun.1 scene that cracks me up is the witch doctor eating a banana through his giant mask.Then again Sammy doing stand up to the natives who seem Hawaiian gets me going too.The question is did Mitchell and Petrillo make more movies?
Mitchell had a some talent while, judging from this film, Petrillo had less then none.
Don't get me wrong I love bad movies but this is something else, or Sammy is, since if one could remove him from the film then you'd have something someone might want to watch.
Story is about a bunch of friends who are having a party when one of them goes berserk and has his hair fall out and then proceeds to murder three women.
*****SPOILER ALERT*****  Flemming use to sell LSD while at school but this drug is called Blue Sunshine and everyone who took it then is now ten years later feeling the effects by having their hair fall out and becoming a homicidal maniac that kills anyone in their path.
I found myself laughing much more then  jolting in fear, although there were a few scenes were I was startled.
women getting physically restrained and then usually abused in various ways) this can be viewed as a kind of "missing link" between the Irving Klaw/Bettie Page classics of the early to mid 1950's and the gems from House of Milan/TAO in the 1970's and 1980's (the latter still being regarded by yours truly as the exemplar of the genre).
(How hard would it have been for the director to have Olga put her hand next to the victim's face, yank it back suddenly, then show that particular footage in reverse?)
But then its the music and dance that I love about Bollywood movies.
Raj is not given a chance to explain but then he realizes that this is the opportunity he's been waiting for because her family was very rich.
Wow, I read on Netflix that the "MTV" style editing was really annoying, but I thought it could't be worse then the "Whtenake: In the Still of the Night" DVD.
Tom Conti is terrific, but then again, so is the entire cast.
All the obvious issues were addressed pretty quickly and then this had nowhere to go.
Things that swim, fly, walk, lie, creep and crawl, and to gather together and name them all"...(then something about creating woman)...and from the rib of the Madame came Adam full grown...
Back in Oklahoma, I would watch this show after Mary Hartman, then go to summer school the next day and laugh about it with my mates.
One that that is important to note: there wasn't such thing as "syndication" as we all know it back then.
But even back then, "All That Glitters" is one of the most controversial programming of that time, even light-years more than his "All In The Family".
Hey, I noticed everyone spotted the spoof of Knight Rider, but did anyone pick up on this - the plot line about getting super powers from the sun after coming close to it in space is lifted straight from another doomed pilot show 'Northstar' - in which a NASA astronaut got hit in the face by a solar flare and then got super powers every time he looked at the sun!
When Kroll (William) says: Wait till it (the bad) happens, then I'll take care of it-- we believe him, just as much as we believe Cagney's snarl.
This would have put Kroll and his world-wide match empire out of business as well as put him back in "friendly confines" of Wrigley Field sweeping up the matches that his, by then closed down, match factories once manufactured!
That man turned out to be non other then the Gypsy violinist Trino that Kroll himself introduced her to!
The difference between making the movie today, than back then, would be the lack of melodrama between the William and Damita character (heck!
A studio where the words "income security" did not exist, as Jack Warner strove to cut everyone's salary, actors' employment contracts be damned (with no worry for craft union contracts, there were none then in non-union Hollywood).
He is totally convincing, as he manipulates people with his reassuring, "Never worry about it till it happens, and I'll take care of it then."
If you enjoy "B" movies with "C" attitude then this movie is for you.
this show was better then that 70's show any one who had made bad comments really did not watch the show loved it wish they would bring it back.
acceptance is important to me, that is one of the reasons I love this show, maybe more then that 70's show + that tuesday is like the finest thing i have ever seen :)
The scene in which the white boyfriend tells jokes that has the family roaring with laughter but then suddenly frigid when one joke goes too far is highly symptomatic of the confusing problems behind the race issue: namely, that there are identifiable differences culturally between (most) blacks and (most) whites, but that some differences are more sensitive (on both sides), and that, in the end, we all wish they would go away.
But I'm sure it was a better film, then this remake/spoof.
And then someone starts talking.
If you are a casual fan of ZOMBIE films and like the new trend of horror films not taking themselves too seriously, then I can offer no better movie in that style than this.
If you have seen "Meet the parents" or any film like that then you know it will remind you of this film.
If you like films along the lines of Bad Taste, Evil Dead 2, Evil Aliens and Slither then you'll probably understand this movie.
A successful director's job these days seems simply to be that of taking an already burned out concept, removing all intelligible plot moments, merging in a few racially 'hip' moments and then repeat until they have enough money to breed and make more of these sordid offerings.
It's very fake and not the real life in the Hasidic community, boys are smarter then this boy sounds, he knows how to take a train and get around the city and goes to clubs but cant buy himself a pair of jeans.
In particular, Orthodox Jews will be able to understand the psychological enormity of the taboos that Mendy breaks - starting with cutting his peyos (sidelocks), then tasting his first cheeseburger, and having sex with a non-Jew.
I sat in the theater for a while after the credits rolled and then remained in a quiet space for some time in the car.
They spend millions of dollars on rubbish movies and then this classic is produced on a shoestring.
Berusa then tries to use the Doctor as a servant, in a bid for immortality.
All the doctors are then set free, however the fifth doctor is informed that he is now declared Lord President of Gallifrey but he says to the Chanellor of Gallifrey, to take charge until he returns, which is the beginning of the doctor going on the run from his own people.
Opening in the mid-70's and then picking up sometime in the 80's, "The Education of Charlie Banks" tells the story of a bully (Jason Ritter) who appears as some sort of boogeyman to the title character (Jesse Eisenburg).
I was genuinely surprised by Durst's directorial debut.The characters were rich and Jesse Eisenberg did a fabulous job of taking the lead as Charlie.The setting was nice and Durst seems to have gone into great detail in trying to capture the essence of college life in the 80's.Eisenberg ,definitely the star of the show , does a fabulous job getting across as Charlie.He is a wonderful actor and I am glad to see he is back to his "Indie" roots(Squid and the Whale was fabulous.Didn't know why he was associated with Cursed...).The screenplay could have been better but the storyline was not over- complicated and kept you captivated till the end.Durst seems to have a great touch at this which has surprised me but then again he never ceases to surprise us all.He seems to have his hand in everything these days.
As a teenager that loved horror films, what could've been better than USA's Saturday Nightmares block (8PM-11PM) and then, USA "Up All Night" which ran from 11PM-3AM.
So then I became hooked on watching Gilbert Godffried and Caroline who was then replaced by Rhonda Shear.
I then saw for the first time a beautiful blonde Rhonda Shear hosting on Friday nights.
If you have not, then you probably will find that the film is a tad contrived and clichÃ©d--particularly regarding the romantic triangle in the film.
A deranged young man, Gunther Wyckoff (whacko with a gun, played menacingly by Marshall Thompson in perhaps his best performance), shoots a city bus driver with the driver's own pistol, then holds up in a local bar using the patrons as hostages.
Tweety then utters his famous phrase, "I taught I taw a puddy cat."
(Actually, I'm gay but I was closeted then).
Some aspects of the script, such as a rape scene, young Marie-Anne are shocking today - apparently they were not so much back then.
Times have changed since then, and I recently viewed the film a couple of times, when I wrote subtitles to it so I could show it to a close friend.
If one views it as an adult film, then the lack of male frontal nudity and full-on intercourse make the film feel timid.
Plenty of reasons to put bums in seats then to enjoy what was presumably their very first dirty movieÂ Exquisite 20-year old Dutch model turned actress Sylvia Kristel, who had enjoyed minor success in her native country, landed the title role and would forever be associated with the character.
Not even hardcore was proposing anything as offensive at the time, and it was all in the novel, then believed as being a woman's own autobiographical account of her road to sexual awareness !
exotic locations, great music, beautiful costumes and the debut of then 22 years old sylvia krystel pursuing sex joy before the dawn of aids fear.
Classic 70's theme, more controversial today than it was then.
Of course they didn't all rush out to do it then, but Emmanuelle did.
If orgy scenes with participants of indeterminate gender, as well as the visibly aging body of Ms. Huppert, are of interest, then so is this film.
One moment characters are engaging in sexual activities, the next they are spewing pretentious dialog, and then they do something totally unexpected that is seemingly from another movie.
First he plays a guy who carries on with his sister in "Dreamers," then with his mother in this.
If this is the best these people can produce, then they shouldn't have been making films, and George Bataille should have stuck to being a librarian.
The basic story is this: boy goes to live with his parents, dad dies, son pees all over his dad's stuff and masturbates, mom sniffs her son's butt, mom decides to introduce son to a world of sexual deviance and perversion (including participating in group sex with him), mom decides she should leave before the two of them actually have sex (but she conveniently leaves a whore behind for son to fall in love with), mom continues her career as a prostitute, son and whore whip the local restaurateur and cry, mom comes home to cause more trouble, and then mom dies and son masturbates at her coffin.
Daddy then dies, and little Louis finds out that his mother is basically a hooker.
Among my favourite examples of how self-consciously foulsome this dollop is, are the scene where one of Mere's friends sticks her finger up Garrel's arse and then Mummy dutifully sniffs it, and the scene where Emma de Caunes sticks her hand up her "still dripping" womanhood and wipes it onto Garrel's chest.
Watch her in "Bonnie and Clyde" and then compare her to THIS role... you're not even on the same chart.
Seema then finds out that Sidarth is married and Sidarth comes up with a plan to get her back.
First there was Blade Runner, then came Total Recall and now we have Screamers.
Somehow or other we had never come across it, then suddenly, SHAZAM!, it's there!
It's perhaps more than prudent then to point out some of the criticisms one would have of the film (which, perhaps, is moot since he's been dead for decades).
He can be brilliant in throwing in his deep-rooted Catholic ideas as pure visions on the screen, and once or twice in the Fugitive he does... and then other times it falls flat or goes too high where it starts to become a full-blown religious picture as opposed to a societal thriller.
Until then, it's up to Pedro Armendariz to hold the fort as the policeman who has replaced religion with a new faith, politics, although even his missionary faith in atheism is somewhat undermined here by Fonda's nameless priest being a sober believer rather than the drunken fallen angel of the novel.
He's not listed in the credits, but then again...no one is listed.
At first I was a bit disappointed, but then I said "why not?"
It surprised me (even for a Paul WS Anderson movie) how mindnumbing it is, but it never leaves you bored and thats why this movie is better then the original Death Race 2000 in my humble opinion.
Although that isn't really saying that much since this movie really doesn't have much in common with Death Race 2000 other then the title.
I thought for an August bank holiday it was nice to see the mini series Victoria and Albert I liked the way Jonathan Firth and Victoria hamilton played the royal couple if anyone likes royalty then this is for you and I do reccomend it.
And then came movie night.
A Lot of Dumbheads try to say look like ...... look like these idiot always love to look like something now mario kart idiot Mario kart bla bla was made after Twisted metal and Vigilante 8 these are basic car combat games like snes Rock and Roll racing D: relearn them then try to say look like ......  And I m the fan of vigilante , twisted metal and Rock'n roll racing But death Race is a TV Show before all we said made it SO STFU DUmbheads Ä°t's a awesome action game not like the others but You all IMDb's idiot knew everything better then others so U gave 6.4 or ~ like it Please don't watch movie may be you could read book your IQ will be upgraded SO go relearn all things go to the kindergarten
If you want to see an action pack race where all the drivers go through a gauntlet of death, then this movie is for you.
If you like Jason Statham and 89 min action, then see this movie.
Were informed that Death Race has become more popular then the Super Bowl with more then seventy million viewers but we never see one of those people watching.
But more then a pretty face she gets a chance to act, and proves shell be around for years to come.
Approach this cinematic experience as you might any "art" film -- and then be prepared to be pleasantly surprised by its substance.
It's not for everyone, but if you are open minded, don't mind subtitles and want some light entertainment then this movie will not disappoint.
If Smith can make a movie (that really DOES look like a movie) with the small budgets that he usually has to work with, then I am looking forward to see what he can do with some reel money.
The shootouts were Fantastic with blood and Gore I love violence more than anything If you see this one buy it immediately Whatever the price mine cost $14.95 trust me its worth every penny of your money if you loved this one then you will love Jason goes to Hell which I loved it was fantastic
If you don't like this movie, well... then you and I could never possibly be friends.
First it starts off with some exciting action, then degrades into a truly spectacular piece of crap, with a giant, a wizard, and a monkey man.
I gave this movie an extra two points for being one of the only movies I know of to depict the Thai tradition of "finding your animal spirit" which is a ritual celebrated at Wai Kru festival where tattoos are made of a psychedelic ink that then creates a trance where the recipients "become" the animal the tattoo depicts - this is covered with two characters having tiger and monkey spirits respectively and a wizard activating their tattoos.
However, if you are plain and simple minded then you should love this movie.
However, if you are plain and simple minded then you should love this movie.
He has a ton of little rockets that he shoots at the bad guys and then there's the bad boy that he can ride like a surfboard!
And the director of this movie really loves to show guys getting hit and then spinning in the air about ten times before hitting the ground.
One must wonder what some of the so called "critics" use as the fundamentals for judging when they view different genres of movies.I mean come on now...it's a MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE...what we want to see is martial arts action...if you want a great plot then go and watch a psychological thriller or a drama.
But then Cher goes into his cell alone to talk to him?
The suspect hits her, but then she continues being around him?
When I spoke to Tom Barbour (Justice Lowell in this film, stage actor and the father of Dudley Moore in the "Arthur" movies) he said when he got the script he was thrilled -- the film opens with him, it took place in his office, he had every other line, and then on page three -- well I guess you will just have to see it.
Regardless of how one feels about the Afghan war in Canada, the overthrow of a regime dedicated to treating women worse then dogs was justified.
If this is how the majority of men still want to indoctrinate their boys in school to behave, then the world will remain a cruel place for woman from Morocco to Indonesia.
it was hardly "beautiful" as the women were subjugated to being summarily rounded up, imprisoned on a the slightest whim and then beaten, raped, buried alive, or as this one woman...stoned to death by a gleeful mob after being wrongfully accused of uttering obscenities.
her "journey" full of "hope" ends with her being all trussed up and presented to the creep who then asks her to choose which iron chastity belt she would like before brutalizing and raping her (at the age of 12yrs.
at least then.
and if we don't once aging rally ourselves to do something about these injustices now...then when?
If this film does not make you angry, then you have no feelings whatsoever.
The film starts with muted, almost sepia tones, and grayness, then exhibits flashes of color, here and there, while mostly staying in dark greens, blues, and browns.
She then finds she has a gift for running.
And then suddenly it dawned on me: These are people caught up in a much larger historical picture Â out of their control Â and the total historical painting is more important than all the separate details together.
If you don't have a good 162min free of your time, then make it a priority to change it.
A 5min interval was then in place, as which many lost their passion and thought the movie was finished.
The film then proceeds very elegantly for about the first third of its running time.
He uses mostly long pans and tracking shots, and then may stop to focus on a scene as he gradually pulls the camera in closer, but almost never to a close up.
The film then darkens drastically, becomes more political, and also somewhat fantastical, non linear, and rather mythic in tone.
It seems to be hit or miss, but watch out people, this film is all about dialogue without any other focus and if you don't like a bunch of self-absorbed, spoiled philosophizers talking about how nothing means anything, then this movie may have as little meaning for you as it did for me.
I then saw it around ten years on and found it truly captivating.
If you enjoy this movie, watch BARCELONA, then LAST DAYS OF DISCO.
It stands in a very high position in that much neglected and un-nameable genre that presents us with a bunch of totally unlovable characters and then proceeds to make us love them.
Since then, it's grown on me to the point where I have to place its script up there with the best of Chekhov and "The Big Chill."
Still it's better than many slasher films I have seen so if you're a die-hard slasher fan then seek this one out.
Way back then I remembered that after presenting a code to solve, the head man stepped down and walked down the aisle asking "When do we go home?"
Mendez uses a mixture of black and white film with color segments and this is distracting to annoying: if the choices of film related consistently to a tenor in the story (which is not the case) then this technique could be considered artistic.
It is in Boyle's style but it isn't suited to the film, if you have read the book then I'm sure you will agree that it could have been much better - the viewer should watch the film and then fail to understand how they could ever leave such a place.
But then, at what point does alternative culture become popular?
I watched the movie first and then read the book.
When you watch a movie and the most likable character is a mad mental foul mouthed dope smoking Scotsman then you know the producers have got a problem   Another thing I had problems with is the way Leonardo Dicaprio's character Richard suddenly turns from inquisitive backpacker into Colonel Kurtz .
This show was created in 1999 to compete with TBS' then wrestling show WCW Thunder!
Why then did they do many almost criminally bad mistakes, one after another, the last ten or so episodes?
It is also the best indicator of what "24" is like, and if the first two hours do not get you hooked on the show, then nothing will.
If the start of season 4 does hook you (which it should), then go back to the beginning.
He would tell me when he could only watch one more episode and then had to go to bed.
On the whole, this movie seemed more of an experience, including the somewhat obnoxious antics of Bill Murray whose slightly toned down style preserved then sanity of this movie for me.
bit more spent on FX, better lighting, more depth on story, then who knows this could of been a very very good film to push other films such as ALIEN and others, but as it is 7 out of 10
From then on I finished out the season and was amazed.
The first half of the season was solid, but then the second half got predictable.
It feels like a cartoon sometimes and the violence goes so far out there but then so does the evening network news.
It's even more fantastic, if you not watch it as it's aired, but record some episodes and then watch them in in a pattern of 2 per evening for some days after another.
The kid who is supposedly carrying the virus and his family take up a lot of screen time while it advances the main plot, but then they are written out and never mentioned again.
They get captured and then they escape.
Here's why....  That annoying noise as the clock counts down, then two seconds of black screen, before that annoying noise again with a split screen.
or C) Look really guilty and shifty, and then, look up at it?
( A ) "No" - "Okay here's the secret codes then"!
This show needs a little humor -- nothing over the top, just maybe have a character make a wise crack every now and then or even (*gasp*) smile.
First, let me start off by saying that if real counterterrorism agents are half as inept as those on "24", then we're all really screwed.
The sexual implications in the narrative aren't ignored by Welles, though they are tip-toed around (probably due to the restrictions of 1968), and when Welles as the "old gentleman" finds himself the perfect boy to complete his plan, it's hard not to smirk when he calls the bottle-blonde "a fine looking sailor" and then offers him money.
The first was through channel flipping and then projecting multiple things on screen and not being able to focus on just one thing.
It may not rise as much debate today, as we are getting used to more violence, but it certainly opens you're eyes and it's criticism of the media is now probably even more topical then it's ever been.
You notice it at the beginning, but then the you don't notice if the color is changed from green to red.
*SPOILER* If NBK had ended with Mickey and Mallory being killed by a relative of one of their victims then I'm sure everybody would applaud it's "profound message of evil never triumphs".
A 2nd postscript on another form of hypocrisy: Quentin Tarantino, the reigning postmodernist "King of Cool" who plays with pastiche of pop culture genres, wrote the script for Stone's Natural Born Killers, but then criticized the way the film was directed.
Ironically, Tarantino then copied several formal film techniques and innovations straight out of NBK for his later "Kill Bill" films.
Strangelove', where it turns the paranoia of a nation into satire and then deconstruct it in the best way possible.
And then other times still it depends on the energy, desire to entertain and a willingness to admit that there's nothing new under the sun and just crank it all up as loud and as fun as a horror movie can be.
I am sorry to say this but if these comments will save someone a few bucks then good.
But even then I still liked both characters, and I think their roles fit them well.
But even then I still liked both characters, and I think their roles fit them well.
It draws you in with a mediocre beginning with a mediocre start (even though it includes Sam Rockwell, a fledgling actor back then who's moved onto greater things - Charlie's Angels not withstanding).
Papaya also is not great but at least these films have a certain charm ... Download them again but then again who knows what you pretend not to them.
My guess is that the producers were so fixated on pushing back the boundaries of the then conventional taste, that even the most the most rudimentary craftsmanship was contemptuously discarded.
That might have been better actually, because instead we then mainly get characters meandering around Paris and Luxembourg, laughing a lot and wondering why they are never satisfied.
--The women are portrayed as a bit mentally off, except for Colette's mother (upon which Carl then just says how hot she was, which seemed like belittling her after she was kind to them).
In a way it would have been better if this film was terribly made, because then nobody would pay attention to its horrible message.
I then purchased myself a copy.
For those of you who wonder about what it was like to be a slave back then, under those barbaric and intolerable conditions, this is your chance.
Yeah the mom sang one song with a woman's voice and the on the next song she was a member of Blackstreet and then back to a woman's voice again...
Another thing, how did the male lead's dad have a mansion and then when they got outside it was a ghetto apartment parking lot.
The freestyle battle was pretty cool I wish there was more battling then listening to MR. LAME spoken word guy.
I would recommend watching it just for the hell of it just to see how lame it really is, but then again if you're lame it will fit you perfect.
If I had over a million dollars to create a movie then my movie would have the best graphics, story line, audio board, power house studio, and major name actors.
If it is a parody, then it drastically needs humor.
If our understanding is not informed by 'Camera Buff', then 'Torremolinos' is a vinaigrette of politics, porn and art-house cinema.
If it is, then the main topic is exactly the one that makes the film somewhat 'heavy' in its second part and which was one of the central topics in Kieslowski's film.
Most other games I used to play then seem weak and childish (well, duh) when looked at now.
", then look up Escape From Monkey Island, the fourth in the series.
He did it anyways and since then, I wanted to play adventures again.
They then formed their own political platform, the National Women's Party.
It shows, realistically, the indignities women suffered to gain their right to vote- one is shocked that the U.S. government would have the audacity to treat political prisoners in such a fashion (but then again, this is Woodrow Wilson, who led some of the U.S.'s greatest civil rights infractions)--especially in a fight that should never have had to happen.
Steve then announces he plans to set out on a voyage to film part two of his documentary, which will follow him and his crew as they attempt to track down the alleged "Jaguar Shark".
If you enjoyed "Rushmore", "The Royal Tenenbaums", "Punch-Drunk Love", or "I Heart Huckabees", then you most certainly should not let this charming, oddly beautiful little film pass beneath your radar.
If you never challenge people, then they cannot learn and grow.
I think it's hard for most to remember that women have had the right to vote for less then 100 years.
I remember this movie serial as a boy in the thirties,we would ask our mother's for a penny on a Wednesday after school,and line up at the local movie house along with hundreds of kids..mostly boys,it always promised fast action,the Mystery Squadron who had their hideout in a mountain cave,the Black Ace the leader always seemed as though he would never would be revealed,would provide the bad deeds,as the action heated up thousands of young feet would stomp on the balcony floor,it was a wonder that it never collapsed.it would build to a crescendo,THEN it would stop suddenly,everyone would hold their breath as the hero would be put in seemingly inescapable peril,NEXT WEEK...see the next thrilling chapter,we would pile outside still gripped in the spell and discus with actions what had taken place,we would then speculate as to how he was going to get out of this latest fix,Bob Steele,Tom Mix,Hoot Gibson,Buck Jones,Ken Maynard,our heroes,who never kissed a girl,in our games no one wanted to play the Black Ace.Happy innocent days.
A tabby I thinkÂ" which isn't funny at first, but then you realize that all he has on the island are Siamese cats, which only make me laugh harder in my seat.
Let's put it this way, so I don't give anything away, Dr. Gerald Robotnik makes his little speech, then people in the background start screaming things that would familiar to older audiences.
If you have nothing better to do and love anything sci-fi then watch it - you might get a laugh out of it.
Some of these scenes were removed from the script prior to shooting, some of them were shot and then excised from the final cut of the film.
One minute he is all wild, then he is comforting Pamela.
It's then that the whole Times Square District exploded, in a pre-announced concert that they gave there, that even Pamala's stuffed shirt dad David finally saw the light and joined in along with them!
Among all the other good things to say about the film "Times Square" what stuck out more then anything else, beside Nicky and Pamala, was it's memorable and catchy soundtrack that packed some twenty, count em' twenty, songs in the less then two hours in length motion picture!
So changes to the storyline could not take away from its basic ambiance nor from its preservation of the look of 1979 Times Square-something that was even then a ghost world.
If silly "B" fun, coupled with oodles of nekkid cuties, is what yer after, then the MooCow is here to tell ya this is yer twisted cup of java.
It's great when the school girls stumble across the old satanic temple and find the book on black magic spells and then they start to form a coven and try to summon up a demon and then one of their friends tries to stop them before they offer a human sacrifice, it's just really good.
For example, anytime she wears the college girl uniform (open shirt and skimpy mini mini skirt) she immediately gets naked like in the glorious scene at the confessional, and then while performing a striptease to tease the construction workers.
If you are looking for cheap entertainment then look elsewhere!
So if you love heartfelt stories that doesn't have nudity, cursing, pagan rituals, or fat chicks, that the whole family can sit down and watch while you visit your Alzheimer's stricken grandmother in the spare no expense, rest home of luxury you put her in... then this is the film for you.
this is also seen by the cars going fast, i think this shows that he is being left behind going slower then everyone else because he has no charismatic qualities.
I had never heard of it before, but I enjoy Christian Slater, Elisha Cuthbert, and William H. Macy on screen, they're great actors and then I read on the summary "Office Space meets Taxi Driver", lol, I had to see this movie.
If she doesn't want to do the scene then just don't do it, or even be a little creative with you shot choices, instead we get one of the most unconvincing body double shots ever filmed.
And then there is the hummingbird.
And then the descent into the everyday.
Bob is then branded a hero.
Only then, is she truly beautiful.
It's the same tired 'this is all a hallucinatory dream sequence in the moment before death' crap that ruins so many films that almost make a statement, and then, at the last minute, confess to being delusions.
If nothing past the first fifteen minutes of a film is 'real', and the main character dies at the end of a film with the realization that the things you just saw were all some literature professor's self-referential wet dream of metaphor and allegory, then what is this film worth?
He then saves Cuthberts life and this is where the story really begins.
He then starts to improve his life and his character becomes more likable but, ultimately his character goes more and more into depression and looses his trust of everyone again and you start to dislike him again.
There's also some rather humorous gay moments, particularly with an obviously gay hat seller who sells Power his own hat, and is then told by Power to throw the other one out.
Every now and then Bob imagines shooting five loath coworkers or blowing up ADD's building.
Nine years ago the two were man and wife, then Tally left him.
This is really no lesser an achievement than the renowned Randolph Scott/Budd Boetticher Westerns; then again, director Lewis was no slouch (for he made his fair share of minor classics)!
The star, then, is supported by a most excellent cast: Angela Lansbury (a fine actress but a rather unlikely chanteuse), James Bell (a usurped town leader), Jean Parker (an ageing belle and the latter's wife), Wallace Ford (predictably in the role of the reliable town doctor), Ruth Donnelly (as Scott's gracious elderly housekeeper), Jeanette Nolan (as the wife of a revenge-seeking ex-con whom Scott has killed in self-defense), and an interesting trio of villains Â powerful boss Warner Anderson (who also fancies himself a ladies' man and, in fact, strikes up relationships with both Parker and Lansbury throughout), shifty but nervous gambler John Emery and smooth gunslinger Michael Pate (making for a worthy opponent to Scott).
It is all then about the sexual desires of women and men.
His ambition is to portray, portray philosophical aspects of life and he uses first a layer of abstraction, a net of relations that correspond to the philosophical aspects in question and then a colouring and flavouring of the pieces in this net.
I know that all of the film-school graduates may disagree with me, with him being a much loved director, but come on now, if this is beautiful art, then so are paintings of soup cans.
If you liked Mullholand Drive, Lost Highway, Eraserhead and the more abstract films of Lynch, then this is his masterpiece.
Grace embraces and kisses the Polish actress then disappears.
If it were tomorrow, then I probably wouldn't have seen this film today.
She's all over the shop but then I suppose that is what acting is all about.
But then again, we saw new camera angles we hadn't see before.
And then maybe we can see if it reveals itself to be even more than the exceptional movie it seems to be.
("Axxonn", "Axe On"), he directs her to her death, then applauds her (you might say the horse has been brought to the well, but drank of its own volition).
Mullholand drive: Made for TV originally, then made into a movie.
Let's film a bunch of footage, then put it together so it seems very dream-like, and use Lynch's name to sell it as a very artsy work of art.
If you are going to use DV, then at least make it interesting.
If not, then go back to film, please, and give us a boring but beautiful movie.
If it doesn't fit, then I can't recommend seeing Inland Empire.
If you like a linear, clear-cut story, then don't see this film.
If you appreciate non-linear, surreal drama/horror, however, then by all means go see it.
There's a group of pretty prostitutes in a motel room, who talk to Laura Dern's character and sing and dance, "Do the Locomotion," and then at the end lipsynch Nina Simone's "Sinner Man" behind the closing credits -- one of the great closing credits of recent decades, a rollicking, gorgeous episode, which cheers you up but still contains flashes (Laura's face) that haunt you with memories of the strangeness and terror that's passed.
If you aren't in on the joke then I cannot imagine you leaving the theater happy after three hours of pure, free from concentrate, unpasteurized lynch.
I remember loving it back then but, for some reason, I didn't find it that funny this time around.
Very few movies have the overall excellence of this one..."My Favorite Year" melds together a superior script, outstanding ensemble cast, and outstanding direction from Richard Benjamin...and the crowning achievement of it all is the tour de force performance by Peter O'Toole...Mr. O'Toole takes a character that potentially could have been a buffoon and creates a hilarious yet touching portrayal of an aging action film star who has to do American TV for his "new business associate- the IRS"...assigned to watch over our British invader is Mark Lynn-Baker, who is lucky to still have hair by the end of the show...which by the way is one of the cooler endings ever...and ya gotta get the movie to see it for yourself...I could say something wonderful about each member of the cast...and you'll want to pay particular attention to Joseph Bologna as "King Kaiser"...in fact, rent this movie, enjoy it, then buy it...you can watch it over and over again and love it each time...one note...the scene with the firehose on the roof is one of the funniest movie sequences ever...but it is all good...and I loved it!
If there is nothing else on cable or free tv then it's worth a look.
He plays a larger then life Earol Flynn character.
If you approach this as what it is, unashamed feelgood family fare then you'll probably enjoy it without necessarily wanting to see it again for a few years.
We're supposed to believe that before the movie Bishop was down and then all of a sudden at the beginning he turns into some cold, calculating guy willing to murder his friends?
This cartoon tells about a little documentary made by a talking dog saying about his new pathetic life with a bald dumb called Larry.After buying him, Larry goes to a department store in downtown to buy some new furniture.But the old guy makes many stupidities like putting a nuclear globe in a common lamp and then destroying part of the store, or when he puts his dog in a little SPA bed but Larry adjust to a killing(And not relaxing) speed.
It wasn't quite as good as 'The Life of Larry', but then again, it had to be a bit more child-friendly to be on Cartoon Network.
If a humanoid is "like a human" then is an aquanoid "like.....water?"
And then some.
then avoid this film like the plague however if you are looking for a cheap laughter filled night in with the lads, this is the one for you.
If this is the case, then those involved should hang their heads in shame for giving us this abysmal addition to the genre.
I spent first 20 minutes itching to turn it off since the animation style didn't seem all that pleasant, but then things just kept happening and before I knew it I was really immersed in it.
The three are then swallowed whole by a giant whale.
If you've enjoyed Tokyo Godfathers, then you will also like this movie.
Mind Game sort of takes Waking Life's "all over the place" style (cartoony one moment, then rotoscoped the next) then adds a story and characters and a LOT of humor.
Nihaal Singh on reaching New York agrees to identify Romeo but on one condition - he will first bring Romeo to his hometown in Punjab to clear his name, bring back his lost glory, redeem his family Honor, and then hand him over to the American authorities.
His acting in this film is excellent.Omar Epps and the rest of the cast are fairly good as well.The film is about four friends named Q,Bishop,Raheem and Steel who skip school one day, they find out afterwords that one of their peers was shot and killed while he tried to rob a store.After hearing about this, Bishop(Tupac) wants to do something crazy.So the four friends go and rob a store but Bishop ends up killing the owner.They then run into an alley where Tupac then kills Raheem.He threatens to kill Steel and Q if they tell anyone.The film then goes on with Q and Steel trying to hide from Bishop who is losing his mind and kills some more people, then frames Q for it.Q must prove his innocence and confront Bishop.Juice is a pretty good thriller with good performances and a good early 90's rap soundtrack.
Don't expect this to be a great movie or take things seriously then u'll be thoroughly disappointed.
If you want laughs, then just sit back and relax and enjoy!
oh yes in Bollywood we have many but this is one of the worst films ever made  The film has a decent plot but it's ruined with stupid scenes like Sunny going towards the heroine and his mom Sikri getting fits in India  Even the skin show is forced and then the game of Sunny to play Behaal Singh is worst and even Romeo comes across as a stupid idiot   The film makes no sense and is a example of mediocrity  There are several scenes which are so stupid and also the entire track of the FBI suddenly wanting to kill the president is awful and so is the finale  Direction by Rahul Rawail is terrible, it makes even YODHA look a classic Music is bad  Sunny Deol is himself, funny in some comic scenes and over the top in some and too loud in several portions but he manages to lend some credibility to his character- 6/10 The girls Shilpi Mudgal and Nupur Mehta are bad Kamaal Khan is a joke as the main villain  Arun Bakshi is okay,   Surekha Sikri is hilarious
To be fair, if you like irrational action, then this movie is for you.
This is essentially a slapstick farce in the vein of POLICE ACADEMY (they were all popular around then weren't they?)
It's starts out like a buddy movie, with four guys bunking off school hanging out together, then it becomes a film about whether one of them, Q, should concentrate on his DJ career, or allow himself to get drawn into petty crime by the group's charismatic leader, Bishop.
It is only perhaps broken by the unnecessary interlude with Sting, which shows the man with a good deal of smugness, even back then and within this film.
If you're the kind of person who puts up with this garbage, then it's a decent diversion.
DEVIL FACE, ANGEL HEART (Bin Lim Mai Ching)  Aspect ratio: 1.85:1  Sound format: Mono  Betrayed and left for dead by a gangster's duplicitous moll (Gigi Lai), a hired assassin (Daniel Wu) undergoes plastic surgery to remove the facial deformity which has marginalized him throughout his life, then returns to Hong Kong to take revenge against Lai and her associates.
But, then again, this film is something else.
Now, we watch DEATH BY DIALOGUE, also from 1988 and a vehicle for the then red-hot Ken Sagoes, which by comparison is *ALL* charisma.
He then has a nightmarish run through a patch of woods before coming upon an 80's Arena Rock Metal band playing "When The Ax Does Fall" or whatever it's called.
If you call that boring, then you might as well be dead.
Stage Fright is basically a "whodunit" because you, the viewer, will think you know who the culprit is in this for a while and then realize that maybe you don't, after all.
But then, when you've delivered a shot as spectacular as that long dolly of Richard Todd from exterior to interior and up the stairs, you can do anything you darn well please.
If you know ANYTHING at all about film, then STAY AWAY from "Juice"!
If I wanted to make a film taking place in Iceland I would first show off the Icelandic landscape, create interesting characters who have motives, and then show more of the viking culture itself: the weaponry and armor, the religion, the sailing, the long-ships, etc.
It expressed the everyday unromantic experience of what it must have been like then.
Which help bring us closer to what life could have been like back then.
I hope that Matsushita continue with the manga, because it sadly remains on hiatus since 2003, and the manga is FAR superior then the anime series.
And then there's Joseph Cotton looking as though he belongs on a slab in the morgue.
If you think "Blow - Up" is Antonioni's great statement on the 1960s in so -called "Swinging London" and Mr Lester's "The Knack" a film that shaped a generation then I suspect "Petulia" will be fine for you.
If,on the other hand you think Antonioni's movie was an overblown con trick and "The Knack" too clever by half,then you may prefer to watch the very beautiful Miss Christie and the admirable Mr Scott in some other movie.Perhaps one where the director isn't always shouting "watch me - I'm going to amaze you".
If you don't like abrupt flashback edits and a story that unfolds slowly, then this is not for you.
If you're easily thrilled/scared by little lumps of unused screenplay crumpled up and dragged by string under a sand surface, then this is for you.
There's a shot of an elderly woman in a wheelchair, dressed and coiffed beautifully, with her neck in a tortuous looking brace being pushed quietly through a service area on her way to the festivities and then a quick, jarring cut to James Gurley, one of Big Brother's guitarists, playing a psychedelic riff, then a quick cut back to the woman in the wheelchair, then back to the lobby floor festivities where Joplin is singing at the top of her lungs next to Sam Andrews playing guitar whilst well-dressed party goers (looking very decidedly unlike a typical Big Brother crowd,) boogie all around them.
It starts out light and amusing then turns dark and insightful.
When?` SprÃ¤ngaren is a good movie, well worth an eight, but it could have been a little more fast-paced, like to book, and then it would have deserved maybe even a niner...
If you think that earning money, and buying the right things, or saving so that you CAN buy the right things is something that people do without any troubles, then you have to watch this movie.
There are many examples of how poor people were treated differently then the more wealthy people.
This film isn't something that will change your life or be considered amongst the great films but if you want to watch a great story acted well then this is the film for you.
That is not to say 'The Pursuit of Happiness' does not deliver what it set out to do, for it wholeheartedly does and then some.
If you, ever in your life have struggled and against many odds and discouragements achieved something, then you will know what the underlying beauty of the movie is.
You go through times in life when you feel that things couldn't possibly get worse - and then they do - and then they do again.
If you ever wanted to see a movie that portrayed what really makes a man, then you must see this movie.
It's an amazing film and if Will Smith doesn't get at least an Oscar Nom, then the Oscars will just suck.
As I saw it then, it needed very few, if any, changes.
The characters are bland, with very little dialogue, in fact, there is really only an escalation of dialogue after the 40minute mark, till then it is pretty much people running, but don't worry after the 40min mark, people still run for the majority of the film.
if you enjoy ugly people, running, and trees, then you've found your cult classic.
My advice: get every single copy you see, snap the disc in half then put it in a box.
then put that box inside another box.
then post it to yourself.
For all that I liked about it, I couldn't endure the duration of the movie and wound up fast forwarding to the few cool bits, my favourite being the guy scaling the telegraph tower then crawling like a spider across thin air.
If WETA's Richard Taylor said the lavish quote that's adorned on all the movie posters then he was either intoxicated or motivated to encourage New Zealand film, not to give a fair opinion of the movie.
It's the sort of fable that cheers one up when the blues draw in and then turn into a blackly dark cloud, yes it be true, old craggy faced Paul Hogan has the gift of comedy.
They did, they laughed and they cried and then laughed some more.
But then, that is the Director's call and Kasdan couldn't seem to let the project go.
It is there he first makes a living skinning wilder beasts with brothers Ed (Bill Pullman) and Bat (Tom Sizemore) Masterson, then he builds a reputation as a good lawman, grows his moustache, meets partner Doc Holliday (a near show-stealing Dennis Quaid) who is slowly dying of tuberculosis, and makes sure all townspeople do not have any guns.
That is quoted from the back of the movie case - in actuality, the heroics he learned in Vietnam included shooting a Vietnamese woman, and then dropping his gun and running from other Vietnamese with sticks.
Better wait until it comes out on TV and then watch it.
When the guy comes to the main characters base with that scrool then he is chopped up by the screamers.
For the first couple minutes the baby is hidden and you're supposed to assume it's a normal non-mutant baby, but then his wife holds the baby in the light and you see that their baby is in fact a rubber doll with a monster face.
I suppose if the whole point of this movie was to make the viewer relate to the horror and isolation that soldiers felt from being in Viet Nam then it did succeed at that.
on her body and then walk away from her corpse to let it just rot there was disgusting.
If you're not used to seeing gritty, no budget 16mm depraved amateur student film sickness disguised as a movie then you shouldn't watch it.
If you're a fan of low budget horror films with a very sick ending then you should definitely watch it.
A man on a mission one could say (the character in the movie, but maybe that describes Dolph as man too) then.
If so, then watch it, but even if your answer is yes, it might disappoint you!
That sort of sexual power-mongering is bad enough, but then the controlling bastard must kill certain sexual partners (and others) who might expose his escapades.
Back then, it seemed like an interesting film.
Pretty Maids All In A Row entrertained me then, and it entertained me one night in August 2006.
Vadim films two teenage girls walking from behind and then brazenly zooms in on their behinds.
We then shift to an outside shot of a high school.
We are then introduced to Tiger, played by Rock Hudson, in one of his most offbeat roles.
If you can ignore the misogyny of every female in this movie being a ditz/victim/sex object/cuckold, then you will enjoy this very of-its-time pre-sex-comedy-era sex comedy.
But then we have a great action finale with 'The Phantom,' Alf Sykes, his son and Ken all fighting or hanging off the highest cliff while Jenny and her father's men speed to the rescue with Ken's horse 'Tarzan.'
It is then that Ken learns more about Tombstone Canyon and the mysterious screaming phantom who kills as many of the Lazy S cowboys as possible.
If you've seem either AIR BUD or AIR BUD 2: GOLDEN RECEIVER then you've seen AIR BUD 3: WORLD PUP.
If there is an Air Bud 4 then it better be better than this!
However, rather then Schwarznegger, Dolph Lundgren hasn't lost that touch of a Cool Action Dud He gets better the older he gets.
Rather then Retrograde this Movie was a lot better.
Lee, then, expires in a fiery death at the hands of the sadistic McDowell Â except that whatever tension there was here is destroyed by its being continually cross-cut with the flight of the central group!
The 1961 part was about two elderly ladies that were frustrated because they couldn't express then selves in any way, the second part I really liked a butch girl named Any and a feminist named Linda meet an fall in love and finally the last one was so funny, Ellen Degeneres stared as Kal so it was awesome, Anyway, Kal and Fran want to have a baby so the go to the sperm bank and well you'll see if you watch it!
What a waste of an outstanding actress in the first segment The first segment had so much potential but then they moved on to the next segment... Miss Tree put the bird back in and the home was empty.
and then the obligatory "never I'd rather die!".
Odd, then, that the series' major weakness is that there's too much going on, too much action and not enough quiet spots, which makes for a rather relentless and one-note viewing experience when it's not broken up into its original chapters.
If History loves Star Wars as much as I do, then Episode I will be forgotten forever, replaced by Episode II.
The Clone Wars series will fill the void and we will then be left with the prequel trilogy we had all hoped for.
They then find out (after the fact) that they Aren't supposed to blow it up.
There are better things to do with your time - and if you must, then watch any other Horror movie but this one... Jasper P. Morgan
(the mom was working midnights then).
It was on at one o'clock in the morning on what was then The WB-channel 11.
It's starts with a speed boat going through a shed for no apparent reason at all and then double takes of that.
A couple of jibes at Mitterand's government then even try to turn this turkey into a political satire.
I bought it on DVD this spring, and we've seen it about five times since then.
And then you'll know it's script by heart.
So far I've decided its GTA SA, GTA VC, LCS and then GTA 3 last.
I recently got a PS2 which came with a controller,memory card,3 PS2 games and 1 PS1 game for a good price.I didn't play the GTA series when it first came out starting with GTA3 in 2001.I started loving the series in 2005 when I got GTA Vice City for Christmas.I loved it.I then got San Andreas and thought it was the greatest video game of all time.I had GTA2 as well.Now with my new PS2 I play Liberty City Stories which was originally out for PSP.This game costs $30.00 and it is definitely worth it.Remember this is a PSP port and PSP is not as good as PS2 so the game is definitely not as good as GTA San Andreas or even Vice City actually but it is still a good addition in the series.Liberty City Stories takes us back to Liberty City(where GTA3 took place).The year is 1998 and you play as Toni Cipriani.During the game you do various missions for different people just like in the other GTA games.When you are not playing missions you can steal cars,kill people and just plain be a cold-hearted criminal.The storyline in all the GTA games are good with Vice City having the best one.The storyline in this game is pretty good as well.There are some parts of the game that are not too good.First of all the soundtrack.Just like in Grand Theft Auto 3, aside from the classical music station and the 1980's station the other music is re-created.Not real music.It is re-created well but we want music that was popular for the time.Actually out of the whole series, this game has the worst soundtrack.Flashback FM is the best radio station in my opinion but there aren't that many good songs there either.Even in GTA3 the only good station was Flashback.It had some good songs from the Scarface soundtrack but there were so little songs.I like 80's music and GTA Vice City provided the best radio station with actual songs from the 1980's.San Andreas had classic rock from the 70's and great rap and rock songs from the early 90's.If the soundtrack was better the game would be on-par with GTA Vice City.Anyway Liberty City Stories is a good addition in the GTA series but don't expect that much since its a port from PSP.
There's nothing more satisfying then having "Grand Theft Auto" at you're side.
If this is not the least funny film ever made, then that honour must go to a title I haven't seen.
If you haven't seen this film then for goodness sake don't - however bad you've heard this film is cannot possibly prepare you for the awfulness which has to be seen to be believed, but is much better left unseen.
If he was going for "gross-out" laughter, then he fails on all levels.
He replaces the childish craziness of the Middle East with the sanity of the United States (USA=diverse mother land of capitalism) and then replaces his adolescent promiscuity with monogamous marriage.
But then it just gets odder and odder - to a point where it's almost unwatchable and through this try hard weirdness it still produces some lovable Sandler comedy.
Why Adam Sandler would make a horrible movie like that is beyond my comprehension,specially because he has a potential to be a much better comedian then that!
If your expectations are high going into movies like this, then please, do yourself a favor and never watch a movie again.
This movie is a comedy and it stars Adam Sandler if you walk into that theater expecting anything except a stupid-funny movie then you need to instead leave the theater to go home and hit yourself in the face with a rock, after all it can't do more damage to your brain.
In the most simple of terms this movie stars Adam Sandler if you do not find him and his over the top antics funny then I would delicately suggest that you do not see his movies as I understand they are not for everyone.
If you walked into this theater expecting to see Happy Gilmore then again let me remind you that you can actually buy Happy Gilmore on DVD and also there is a rock at home for your face.
If you laughed and had a good time then who cares?
if it's not for you, then it wasn't MEANT for you.
When you're having a bad day and want to watch a brainless, popcorn flick that will most likely have you cracking up virtually the entire movie, then I suggest you see this movie as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, the screenplay then turns into a boring mess without tension or surprises.
Until then, you still may be able to rent or buy it on VHS.
I can't completely figure it out, but I think the reason this movie failed to garner better reviews might have had something to do with the timing of its release; one must remember that the Vietnam War was still an open scab for this country in the mid-'80s, and all the film treatments of the war up until then had been pointed tragedies - from "The Deer Hunter" to "Apocalypse Now", "Coming Home", and even director Sidney J. Furie's other 1978 Vietnam film "Boys in Company C." So, audiences and critics were probably not very open at that time to a film about a romantic relationship in the middle of the war with a semi-happy ending.
It's basically about a bunch of people that move into a house and find it's haunted, and then they all die in grisly ways - the usual!
People die, badly, then the little girls grave is burned....the end.
If this was Umberto Lenzi's shot at making American movies, then he blew it big time.
But then flash-forward 20 years or so, and all goes down the drain.
And then that tomb on the graveyard, that looks from the outside like a Hobbit's house...
Barks a few times and doesn't do anything... and then vanishes.
Fans of Lenzi might wanna check out GHOSTHOUSE (that's what they'll do anyway), but if you're just beginning to discover Italian horror-cinema, then go with stuff from Argento, Bava, Soavi and Fulci.
this movie is definitely not a winner, but i've seen worse, unless you have really nothing else to do, then you can watch.
Hiding behind the ridiculous soubriquet Humphrey Humbert, Umberto Lenzi (of Cannibal Ferox fame) directed this lame late 80s Italian/US co-production that starts off bad, and then rapidly goes downhill.
Final thoughts: You'll be apologizing to your brain afterward, but if you have a liking for Italian Horror then you'll likely enjoy the ride anyway.
If you're interested in a haunted house flick with something different to it then check Ghosthouse out for some creepy and gory scenes.
Then Nic Cage tracks the the stolen car and find the kids and then let the aliens just take his son in their giant space ship ( Really ).
Many questions that would seem crucial to the plot are left unanswered, not to mention that the ending of the angels/aliens taking the "chosen" children away to "safety" (another planet that is meant to be a juxtaposition of the Garden of Eden) has a similar feeling to reading the last sentence of a book that says "And then I woke up and realized the whole thing was just a dream."
If you are really eager to see this movie I would recommend waiting until it comes out on DVD and then renting it.
It should be at very least labeled Sci-Fi - that way, there'd at least be some effort to make an accurate representation to those of us who happen NOT to subscribe to fundamentalist doctrine which we can then choose to waste our money & time watching, or not.
How an alcoholic atheist(cue the laughs) is converted to believing in something more than randomness and then willingly gives up his son just made me groan with disbelief.
It started strong with a flashback to the page of numbers being made , then it went to Cage as a MIT professor and his son gets a mysterious page of numbers.
If, like me, you expect films to have a cohesive plot, intelligent writing and an imaginative ending then this is NOT the film for you.
The film is fantastic up to the last fifteen minutes and then it all goes to hell in a handcart.
Because the three rules that were supposed to be followed are accidentally broken, and more fuzzy creatures pop up and then later turn into despicable and gruesome monsters.
It has more heart and soul then a lot of movies that I have seen in a long time.
If you break them, then all hell will break lose.
I love it when she blends one in the mixer and then fries one in the microwave.
I remember really liking it back then and I bought the video tape of it a year or so ago.
Its a very good movie (I thought) and, the acting was better then your avg.
Well that's exactly the technique that Dante and Spielberg use here, building up the aura of quintessential small-town America and then gleefully allowing their malevolent little protÃ©gÃ©s to tear down that image by running amok!
"Le Porno Killers" has definitely an awesome title,but fails to deliver both violence and an abundance of sleaze.This tedious bore features two female agents(one of them is Carmen Russo of "Patrick Still Lives" fame)who go after Vassilli Karis.First of all the title is completely misleading,because there are no porno scenes and no killers in this flick.At least beautiful Carmen Russo provides some full-frontal nudity.First we see her sunbathing nude then she gets up to walk across the yard buck-naked.Then she takes a shower with her female co-star and they engage in a truly fantastic lesbian scene.Finally we see her in a menage-a-trois totally nude on the bed then briefly getting up.Still the film is pretty light on sleaze and the action is deadly dull.Only for tolerant fans of Italian smut.4 out of 10.
I'm sorry the descriptions put me off seeing 'Keane' back then, because its painful nature made it hard to concentrate on it in my house.
The movie quickly invades your soul and then seduces you onto an emotional roller-coaster.
The words "I love you" have never resonated so much overwhelming emotion that if you are not in tears then you my friend are not human.
then, i'll be patiently waiting for the 4th one!!
My guess is that if you're curious about seeing the third Inuyasha film then you are already an Inuyasha fan, so I'll write this for all you "otakus" out there!
Let me give you one instance of how this film fails at every turn: When Hannigan first meets her beau's best-est buddy, Monk is shown diving into a pool, coming up on the other side, showering off, then washing a car in her too-tiny bikini and even pole-dancing with the shower.
"Films" like Date Movie are the lowest of the low; the lowest form of sludge churned out, stretched out and then given cinematic releases for whatever reason.
If there are half a dozen or so worser films from the last decade; indeed two decades; indeed half a dozen decades; indeed EVER; then we all, collectively as a human race, ought to hang our heads in shame.
Here is a film that says if you're not thin; not somewhat easy on the eye; not Caucasian or if you are somewhat physically deformed in some way, then there is absolutely neither no space nor no hope for you in this world; and if you DO NOT see to these 'flaws' immediately by way of 'correcting' them, then it's encouraged that you find some small space somewhere so that you may crawl up inside of it and die.
People sat down at word processors and TYPED this stuff out; they printed it and PROOF READ it; it was GREEN-LIT; it was SENT to people auditioning for parts; it was SHOT and RE-SHOT and then EDITED to form some sort of basic sequence of moving images along with everything else Â how on EARTH does this manage to happen?
I prefer darker humour myself, but if your sense of humour is that of a pubescent teenager, then sure, I can see how you'd like this.
Comedies aren't "funny" anymore, you want a good laugh your better off looking towards something darker, but then again, that's hit and miss.
Question: It's a series of famous moments from movies that may or may not actually be romantic comedies, and then makes a satire of them as if it were concocted by ten-year olds who had never seen the original pictures.
Hank: Well then, hit me with another Â£50,000!
Here they simply made sets, costumes and situations similar enough for you to recognize the source material and then either laid vulgarities or toilet humor on top of it.
If that was your goal then you succeeded.
then I weep for our future.
But if you're sitting there with a look of disgust because you can't believe that somebody greenlighted a budget for this tripe then you know to avoid this like Paris Hilton with the plague, and you give me hope.
If you have even the slightest inkling that you might want to see this then grab a bottle of White-Out and vanquish those thoughts right now.
Please skip it, have one of your friends go see it instead and then ask about it.
If they don't knock your teeth out for setting them up to lose money and 90 minutes of their life, then you can go see it yourself.
The stuff is then taken away in shuttle-craft to planetary processing plants.
But, even so, lower your expectations just a tad, for then you will not be disappointed when you realize it is not in the same company as such classics as Notting Hill or Return to Me.
Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey) used to be a once sensitive, quiet guy and then has become a big jerk who is a big shot photographer now.
Gremlins benefits a little from the fact that I grew up with it, but mostly I liked the sequel and since then I've realized the original is better.
We are lead to believe that Jennifer and Matthew were childhood sweethearts (that never kissed) who lost touch at 14 then reconnected at 24 when he not only breaks her heart but actually destroys her.
He courts her, she falls for him, then after sex he bails and never speaks to her again.
However the movie became a bit of a shambles as soon as the first ghost came along and the movie never really engaged me from then on.
(Admittedly I wandered in from one theater to another when the movie I paid for proved to be a bust, so I can say I split the cost, but even then I feel a little cheated.)
Little to no surprises in the plot, but then who ever sees romantic comedy for the plot?
What strikes me the most about Gremlins is the blend of tones, the comedy mixes brilliantly with the cute factor, and then all the serenity is destroyed by the carnage unleashed.
So I just thought I would share this info with you as I had previously tried for years to get hold of this fantastic little known miniseries without success.Remembered watching it when it originally aired on BBC in 88/89 and since then it has always stuck in the back of my mind as aone of those "Must own" series.
Nature seemed much grander then, the stars are closer, the sun is hotter, the rivers wider and in my minds eye I can see all of us, moving through this giant landscape like a strange nomadic tribe.
It started out mildly okay, then went downhill from there.
and i hated the movie from then on out...but as i hit middle school i basically mentally prepared myself over middle school about it and finally 8th grade year i watched gremlins: the movie that scared the sh** out of me when i was little.... And boy i don't know what i was missing.
If you like *REAL* scifi's, like this one, then also see the movie version of "Lost in Space."
John Ford gave him his start but then they had a falling out and Johnson didn't work for him for years.
If you like westerns, especially ones that have parts that remind you of Louis L'Amour tales, and if you like top level acting, then this is a show you want to see.
STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning   With everyone talking about how youth crime and violence has skyrocketed almost to the same level as the States in Britain, this action thriller from over fifteen years ago now looks like a grim prediction from back then, with Harvey Keitel's hardened detective flying over to help stem the drugs/murder problem whilst pursuing a villain he was originally after in the States who he now believes has started to prowl around Europe.
If you haven't seen this film then, go rent it, buy it, you just have to see "Gremlins".
It then immediately watched it a second time, and really enjoyed the plot, which made a lot more sense the second time around.
The gremlins are the scene stealers here, at first they are very cute then all of a sudden when they start causing carnage they are quite the opposite.
Billy being the typical person that he is breaks all the rules At first gizmo multiples creating 4 more Mowgli who then eat after midnight turning them into Gremlins viscous nasty goblin like creatures With help of his mum Billy succsefully kills off three gremlins except there leader Stripe who escapes to the swimming pool and jumps in all hell brakes loose I'm not really sure why i like this movie probably because of the music and because of the gremlins them selves there cool
Every now and then, you have a major fight, with over eight enemies on screen at once.
You could smack someone into the air, juggle their butt, then, just for kicks, hang them from a lamppost, and so much more.
It has some weak points, the story sometimes seems to forget one or other character, and then in the end they all come together like it was so natural.
So overlay this is another great spider-man game but it doesn't compare to ultimate spider-man and spider-man 2 game.And the spider-man 3 game is better then the first spider-man movie game so i recemond this spidey game is very fun.
The other super villains are the Lizard (which is fun as long as you don't keep dying, because then it gets rather boring) and Morbius/Shriek.
The fights with him are long and difficult, and his taunts get very annoying after the hundredth time (and he repeats them about 50 times in one fight, so you end up playing the level, dying, and then repeating the level, which equals more annoying taunts).
This being pre-Code (and no stigma of cartoons being only a children's medium then), there's lots of drinking of alcohol treated in a humorous manner especially of the horse at the climax.
If you go in thinking this is Schindler's List, then you will not get this.
What I got instead was a well written and developed character for the first hour or so, and then a cheesy but extremely fun finale that reminded me of the best low budget horror films I grew up with.
Even though the humor was dark and cruel,it was hysterically funny.For a movie made on a very low budget,this was impressive.It began with a gory scene in a thunderstorm and then begins years later.The actor that played Monty was perfectly cast.I loved it at the end when he got back at his tormentors since they sure had it coming!
This film has more depth then "The Blair Witch Project" or "Shawn of the Dead" and it's just as brutal and sick as "Jacob's Ladder" but funnier then the fire extinguisher scene in the French film "IrrÃ©versible".
If you're a fan of the genre then you wont be expecting Oscar nominated performances from the cast or a script that will stand the passage of decades.
The first 10 minutes where you are literally 'introduced' to the main characters is a fantastic hook and I knew then that I was going to enjoy the film.
I love how the creatures are more traditional style then CGI which doesn't seem to be realistic, i do admire CGI unless it's well done.
If you were a fan of the Project Greenlight television show then actually go see the movie.
If only he could have escaped without murdering the priest, then I wouldn't have lost interest.
Or, if it had somehow been an accident, then maybe I would have cared.
If it's that the death penalty is bad or that people should give ex-cons a chance to succeed, then it is completely obscured by the time the movie is finished.
But then again this was the heyday of social liberalism during the New Deal when it was believed all of life's ills could be cured with the right government social program.
We begin with light comedy, proceed to an adorable romance and then follow the characters as their lives - and the film itself - grows steadily darker.
I was searching on the internet for it and then walked into the next room and saw the closing scene on the TV!
A young girl whom is seemingly possessed then unloads a gun and at the end supposedly opens the door for the aliens.
Spielberg, along with his then collaborators Frank Marshall and Kathleen Kennedy (the trio founded the production company Amblin Entertainment), served as executive producers of the film.
Spielberg got a then up-and-coming screenwriter named Chris Columbus to write the script (Columbus would go on to become the director of the first two "Harry Potter" movies as well as the first two "Home Alone" pictures), and Roger Corman protege Joe Dante to direct the picture (Dante directed 1978's "Piranha", a witty spoof of Spielberg's first smash hit "Jaws", and a segment of Spielberg's "Twilight Zone: The Movie" a year earlier).
"Gremlins" then turns into a super-duper special effects picture, with the creatures created exceptionally by Chris Walas (Oscar winner for the makeup job on the 1986 remake of "The Fly").
If you stumble upon this on TV at 3AM and you cant sleep, then you might find yourself getting through half of it before you get bored and fall asleep.
A farming family is getting ready for a dinner, the son is playing around with the video camera, within minutes the power goes out, they think its a lightning storm, the father and 2 sons (1 has the cam with him) go to check it out outside, they notice a nearby transformer is sparking and sustained damage, they walk closer to see it, they look down under the transformer and notice 3 aliens slicing a cow with a laser, they get spotted, 1 alien fires the laser at them (no beam is seen), the other son is injured, they run back to the house, tell the family, the family immediately panics and wants to take the son to the hospital, the father and the son go to the truck (a really old beat up truck) and cant start it, they notice the engine was completely melted, they run back to the house, and they hear them upstairs, the father and son walk up the stairs and hears a alien in the bedroom (the door is closed), the alien fires a laser through the door, the father fires the shotgun, kills the alien (presumably), they run back down, the family is panicking even more, they attempt to run out of the house, an electrical bolt/laser comes through the window above the door, injures another family member, they run back to the dining room, a loud noise enters the room, they fall in pain, the sound stops, then they notice they all have nose bleeds and what appear to be radiation burns on their bodies, the little girl (no older than 5) says (in a monotone voice) that everything is going to be OK, she seemed zombified and keeps reassuring them everything will be OK and not to worry, she doesn't move or say anything else, the father finally goes out of the house to try to get the truck working or find some other transportation, they hear shots fired, they all run out and notice he's gone and the shotgun is melted, they run back to the house, the son with the camera goes upstairs to change his pants (because he peed himself) he goes back down and notices everyone is gone, he runs back upstairs in the bathroom sits on the toilet, sets the camera to point at him, he says he's scared and doesn't want to die, he starts crying and he says he doesn't know what's going on or why are they doing this, then you see a 3 fingered hand grab the camera lens, a alien grabbed it, looked at it (meanwhile the lens is facing it so you see the alien)it then puts the camera down in a different direction, and that's all you see.
He places the camera on a kitchen counter, they eat dinner some more, a red light enters the room and it shows 2 aliens (obviously costumes, its awful) begin taking the family members away and then the camera slowly gets static on it and fades out, then it goes to credits.
Well, i cant believe what a film that was, If you are like me, then you will find that horrors nowadays are not what they used to be, But JACKPOT BABY, I mean i know that it is made in 1998 but it does not stop it from being probs one of the greatest horrors to be made, Right from the start it actually maintains the course of looking like a genuine home video, and when they realise the aliens are actually after them, The horror on there faces, Some believe Sum Do not, it is just brilliant, And the Way that they portray that Rosie has been taken over somehow is just brilliant, Also they bring in the racist side of it tackling that view with great authority, they make every bit of the film as enjoyable as the ever, People who are looking for flaws in the film i have this message( My God Get A Life ) its a film go bloody have a pop at a Disney film or summit, As for me This is Danny Robinson Signing out with a big 10 outa 10
Basically, this would be a good film to watch with your girlfriend (if you watched this then you probably don't have one... only joking) in the middle of the night with the lights off.
If you're looking for a good fun movie to give the chills and make you think about whether or not there is life out there and are they as hostile as the ones here, then watch this movie.
I can understand how for some people the cuts in the film (where it fades to black then to an expert) can be very annoying, but it effectively heightens the suspense.
I really don't like to rain on other people's parades, and if you enjoyed this movie then Go With God; I am sure that there will films I like that you might find rubbish.
Sorry, it's easy to forget since it is specifically pointed out at the beginning of the film and then virtually ignored for the rest of the story.
The fee for an escort back then - ten dollars plus expenses while on the date!!!
The end of this time is signified by the mistreatment and 'death' of the doll and then West's hit and run accident, in which he runs over a derelict.
is a film that may not leave a very good taste in some peoples' mouths, but then again it isn't supposed to.
At first I was disgusted, but then when I started to get to know Art (poor big, rich teddy bear character), I couldn't help following his plight and unbalanced relationship which develops with his co-star (West - twisted, disenfranchised, sociopath) until the film presented a resolute conclusion.
Until then, I'll watch this live show.
If you don't think its funny then you have no soul, don't like off-the-wall humor, or are incapable of laughing because of too much botox.
But if you are a real film buff that loves acting and content of the finest order, then I suggest that you watch this as soon as possible.
They seemed a little different at first, but then they seemed just right by making their points to the story.
there were so many interesting themes... characters who desired something deeply, then regretted it once it was theirs... pathetic self-defeating behaviors... sex and the pursuit of it... trying to be 'real' vs. living behind a facade...  i also *loved* the music...Hideous Input, I think did most the songs?
I can't get over the reality scenes, the adoring personalities of the film; 'Nancy' the blowup doll; 'Art' the retard; 'West' the twisted f**ck, and the overall feel + story which makes you laugh till you urinate yourself, and then cry like a kid getting his teeth pulled.
And then Bronson comes to her saying he know what she did, he threatens her till she gives him the money the man had.
This tightly handled low-budget French / Italian co-production is an improbable, but an oddly bold and stimulating teaser that seems straight forward at first, then suddenly it leads you down many knotty paths (with Hitchcock shades) before breaking out the truth of the matter.
I had still remembered since then some of the memorable scenes, like opening the fist of the rapist's body to find the button, and Charles Bronson giving Marlene Jobert the button.
He then burns it into thin air.
He then pulls out copy after copy of the document and hands one back to Santini.
Before you condemn this little comedy for being tasteless, keep in mind that they make full length feature films out of this same kind of humor and then charge 8 or 9 dollars to see it at the theaters.
However, if you don't like offensive material, then think twice.
He then sets it up to look like the unsavory Persoff was killed by underworld associates.
And then they discuss the possible explanation of the trick that Cassidy played.
All in all it is one of my favorite shows, and it sure as hell beats CSI, if you ask me, but then again "its a matter of taste".
This is the best series I ever saw, Except then when agent Caitlin Todd died :(.
Okay I'm really starting to get sick of these people who say that this show is a CSI spin off CSI is a bad unbelievable show that is totally fiction they can do forensics in 10 seconds when it takes more then 10 hours, its pure Science fiction CSI is but NCIS is closer to reality its always enjoyable, funny and I'm sure more people would watch it if they could not view it as CSI spin off/Rip off because its not watch one episode and you will see its more about the Federal Agents.
CSI doesn't mean NCIS unless you are Dyslectic, then maybe it does to you.
the plot is far too simple almost childish, no suspense no real action, and full of clichÃ©s.. the principle character doesn't really do a damn thing, with a sick sense of humor, he just goes insulting people here and there showing what the show creators think is an exceptional power of character - the guy fears no one and behaves as if he were president of the United States (he perfectly fits in a context where Dubya is twice elected for president)and then all of a sudden, he miraculously finds the solution to the case!!!
Gibbs left then came back (as we knew he would), Agent Lee also joined the team very briefly and does make occasional appearances due to her romance (if you wanna call it that) with Jimmy Palmer.
Very easy: American government, then American people, then American nation wants to see themselves like Superman all the time.
Maybe not as well Gibbs could handle it, but that sort of skill takes time and multiple assignments to be fully qualified (and by then, the Feds tend to ship you off to their Academies so you can teach what you've learned).
When I read the synopsis and saw that it was made from a play I wondered "How will they work into a story about a project the requisite themes of repressed women, depressed women, teenage angst, and a guy struggling w/ homosexuality but then giving in?"
The architect's son comes home from college, makes some comments about his sisters sn*tch (his word) and his dad's lechery; then he goes to the project where he meets a gay black kid.
One thing that makes this fun and smart show stand out even more is the fact that the show was cast first and then a pilot was written based on the personalities of the primary actors making their characters even more funny and human than any others on TV.
Still it's better than many slasher films I have seen so if you're a die-hard slasher fan then seek this one out.
Foricienta is a greaaaat story, not only for kids.. i'm 20 years old and i loooove it.. the story of flor is lovely she is a person full of love and compassion who, without even really wanting to, changes the life of Fede, and fills it with joy and fun and makes him alive again.. makes him love her.. at times hate her lol.. but fall absolutely in love with her... i used to think this was just some kids stuff.. and then a friend of mine forced me to watch it and i became an addict... i love the songs, the characters, the charming prince.. maybe you wont like it as much cause of all the things she say may not be so understandable in other languages, but it's a very enjoyable show what so ever.. flor is the best... the one bad thing is the end of the first season =( (i won't say what it was) but it's 100% worth watching..
And when her former bridesmaid, Mary McCoy, has her brains accidentally blown out by another IRA bullet, she recruits a friend and they begin to lobby, first in churches and town meetings, then on TV, for a cease fire.
And then the hatred of her neighbors, who throw bricks through her window, bop her retarded son on the head, and perforate her husband's ulcer.
And, of course, if there aren't, and there may not in fact be, then any exploration of human nature is going to give us a glimpse into the heart of a darkness that no one wants acknowledged.
If you were a teenager and that scene didn't inspire you to never become an alcoholic (pardon my double negative), then it was only because you'd already had one too many lost weekends.
This movie is about the morality of machines made by man to fight other men, and then all of man fighting evolving machines that want to be like man, that use mans weaknesses against man.
Even then, I thought it was great despite it being a darker Christmas film than we're used to.
and then there is the title, which i doubt could possibly be any more contrived.
This is established from the beginning and then the film decides to show as many different ways of showing this as it can.
They then get dragged through murder, drugs, sex (Highly un-erotic), ya know, the usual.
Ultimately this story is Amy's, and the story is about isolation- hence Amy's whispered, matter-of-fact assertion at the beginning that "there's just no place for us in this world", her attempts to connect with both boys in the only way she knows how, and then her unseeing stare at the end.
It seems like Araki was testing how far he could goÂand then cheerfully exaggerated some more.
In the middle of the movie,some totally new characters show up and it's pretty obvious they're only there to get killed by the demons.But then again,what other purposes can characters in a horror movie have anyway?This second movie in the "Evil Dead"-series is kinda different actually,it gets more surreal here,mainly because Ash has really lost it here in the first half,and the demons appear to be even more over-the-top and more evil.However,they both grab themselves together near the end for their final showdown.Ash is accompanied by a bunch of idiots but as they're idiots,they don't help much and get killed in some rather original ways.I'm not sure when this movie is situated,but I'm guessing this movie acts like the first one never existed.Not that it completely retells the story,it merely summarises it.And as I took this walk on gross-out lane,I found myself very entertained,somehow shocked but I don't have a clue by what exactly and I did laugh along with Ash and the deer head I must say.That scene really puts a spell on you.Almost as great as the first one
i just finished watching ED2 and i can say it's the best gore-black-comedy that has ever crossed my gore-terror thirsty mind... i'll check army of darkness tomorrow, but i can say undoubtedly that if you loved ED1, then this one will make you cry for more!!!
I do understand why so many people love it, but I admitted then - and now - that this type of material is just not my cinematic cup of tea.
The best part - hands down - was when Campbell, after having taken his hand off, places a bucket over it to restrain it and then puts a bunch of books on top.
I thought this movie was older then actually is, because the character's hair in general looks from the 60's.
You don't even feel sorry for the hillbilly who gets stabbed, slammed by the door, kicked, yelled at, while still being stabbed mind you, dragged and then finally something unknown happens to him under the cellar, but it involves gallons upon gallons of blood.
If you love blood, dark comedy, great directing, classic B movie acting, one-liners and want to be scared ****less, then check this movie out, as well as the original.
They include a woman's head loose and then biting a man's hand with the rest of her body running around with a chainsaw; a hand with a mind of it's own, monster-type grandma and grandpa in the cellar, chase scenes through a forest with trees coming to life and attacking people, on and on....wild, wild stuff.
Since then, I never stopped watching it.
If you like your comedies, black and hilarious, and your horror, gory and sensational, then look no further.
If you read the box then you are ready to get your heart warmed when you pop in this Bergman scripted film by Bille August.
But if you have half-a-brain then you're probably anticipating that the box is exactly what it turns out to be: bull that hopes to get people to watch it even though it's vintage Bergman.
If you believe the box then Anna's mother, who opposes the marriage, is the witch who will be proved wrong, but if you saw "Fanny och Alexander" then you remember that the grandmother was right (and that he relegated the monster father to being a stepfather).
In Bergman's final film "Sarabande" there is a husband named "Henrik" (spoiler coming up) whose sainted wife (whom he did not deserve) dies and then he commits suicide.
Bergman's opposition to Nordenson looks for a minute like it is going to be the only decent thing he does, then you realize that he just wants to match egos with him.
I can't say how much of what unfolds in the 2nd act holds up as being totally true to what Bergman's parents lives were, but then who could?
Oh yea, this movie ain't no documentary - Yes, but then why on earth would you advertise it with a title that has to do with Akbar the Great!
Primarily as the director says on the 3rd DVD, the film is about the love story between Jodhaa & Akbar, then it is about the historical reference & the battles.
That was about the only thing to watch, but then the movie would be like a parody of the great Mugle-Azam (you know like what Epic Movie is!!).
But then now I know it is the actors behind - Aamir is a perfectionist - Lagaan has to be pseudo directed.
He then screams at Jodhaa.
Lets see it starts out with this whole "Troy-ish" Battle directly lifted out n copied or even remade to an extent..  then we go into the actual movie.. the essence of the movie was totally lost in my sense, The director lost me at least because of the length of the movie.. maybe he wanted to convey something great through his research but frankly what he did was nothing more than inflict pain... that was something i was hoping to forget by watching the movie...  Hrithik Roshan continues to amaze me till date with his varied acting talents n Mrs Aishwarya Rai.. lets just say that i don't very much care for what she does... 99% of it is crap anyway ....
And in most cases, the dialogues themselves get weighed down by verbosity Â and surprisingly, the characters who speak Hindi sound more uncomfortable with it then the ones who have to deal with Urdu diction.
I don't understand why there is such sexism in Hindi cinema, the males always get their critiques or praises first and then the females.
And then there are great movies.But very few are truly epics.
And then 'Azeem oh Shan Shahenshah' is one song that will remain etched in your memory long after you leave the theater.
Swades was released in December 2004 and since then, this project was said to be considered by the director, Ashutosh Gowariker.
So anyway, if you don't like dramas but you do like a genuinely good movie, then give this one a try.
Strange as it may seem the whole theme of the film revolves around a plaintive tune which first gained popularity in Budapest, later in Europe and then the whole world.
But then again a lot of people watch Rove, so go figure.
At first you think it's rife with symbolism, that useless tactic that can be "figured out" and then explained as great movie-making.
Just gives you the facts, especially the ones missing from the final report, then lets you make up your own mind about it.
The first episode featured Conan running cross country and then forgetting the key on the window sill - how much more clichÃ©d can you get?
If you don't like it at first then wait and watch another episode.
Well that's not true, I did guess it, but when you're pointed in every direction then you will end up wondering about every possibility.
It's interesting that the scene I think is the better ending is the original ending to the movie, but then those dreaded test screenings proved it too dark...wrong.
Things are fine till little Emily finds an imaginary friend called Charley and then all hell breaks loose.
Next time your child tells you of imaginary friend then you might want to think twice because you never know...........8/10
It was then agreed by her psychologist father David, Robert De Niro,and his former student and children's trauma expert Katherine, Fmake Janssen, that it would be best to get her away from New York City and move to the country for little Emily to recover from the shock that she's suffering from.
Not bad horror mystery thriller that's a lot better then you would have expected it to be with the many negative reviews that the movie "Hide and Seek" got in he press and on TV.
Young Dakota Fanning is perfect as Emily who's suffering more from the truth then some fantasy that her father David and his colleague Katherine think that she's having.
But later the two , especially Steven, come across as more then just grieving parents but very unstable and dangerous individuals.
(Much better then the natural blonde hair she has, in my opinion).
And then people start to die.
I realize that most kids in the world are not disturbed, but some are, and should you ever come across one, then please save humanity and do all us humans a favor by making sure that said creepy little kid is locked away for life.
For some reason, Bobby makes more mediocre films nowadays then he does quality.
DeNiro should have looked at the script and then decided to burn it after reading the first 3 pages.
But then, making this movie at all was not a smart choice anyway.
If you've seen films like 'Secret Window' or 'Taking Lives' or other similar pseudo-mind benders (sorry, other titles don't come to mind at the moment), then you're in for nothing new if you watch 'Hide and Seek.'
And then...Charlie was revealed, and I was so angry I considered walking out of the theater.
I suggest watching the first hour and then leave or change the channel (if you're watching it on TV).
And if the emotion she put into playing this role wasn't enough to tug at your heartstrings, then you ain't human.
But then, there couldn't be a big sword duel between Holmes and Rathe.
Even at this young age, I was impressed to see a film on this grand scale that elevated a historical Black icon like Billie Holliday; this was unprecedented and this was not lost on me then or now.
Pastoral scene of the gallant South; the bulging eyes and the twisted mouthÂthen the sudden smell of burning flesh" Â these words are simply not there.
On their honeymoon, they agree to stay married for six months and then divorce.
She decides to trick him into marriage by going to his apartment, then changing into "something cooler", after which her father shows up, and for some reason Fletcher agrees to marriage.
She then starts steering him to leading his company back to profitability by looking at it as a challenge.
If this movie didn't touch you, then look for meetings that can help you.
Some are quite bad but every now and then a good one comes along.
i have just seen the film and it seems i cannot get a clear impression of it.it requires to be seen again because the action is well to take you by surprise in some points and then you discover that the previous lines had a different importance in the new light.
This movie was made in 1995 and he looked a lot different then.
But even then, I had some nagging doubts.
They're just about ready to treat her the same way they've treated all the previous nannies, but then she strikes her walking stick to the ground, and....  Well, I won't give away precisely what spells she casts to protect herself from the children's wrath and keep them under control.
The movie has one great line, when Thompson explains to the children, "When you need me but do not want me, then I must stay.
When you want me but no longer need me, then I have to go."
No mini-adults here, who are filled with all Macully Caulkin knowledge and wisdom so that if only--if only--the adults would just simply listen to them--why then, the world would be a perfect place where everyone would just get along so well together.
But if you're looking for good old fashioned post-apoc, gritty future in space sci-fi, with good suspense and special effects, then this is the movie for you.
However, due to the Code restrictions then not really that much could be shown.
He was a good looking fellow then!
I was not disappointed then and I was not disappointed today.
He then stands up and leans in rather closely to Ms. Kerr.
Misluck follows then.
Gino, as an ex con, is forced by French law to take residence anywhere but in a city and so he settles with his young wife in the country, where fate turns against him, as first his wife is killed, then he is hounded by his former crime gang to return to his former lifestyle and also one of the arresting officers from his case years previously, the now chief inspector Goitreau is in charge of the area and has a grudge against him and becomes even more suspicious when he finds out Gino's new girlfriend Lucie is working in the local bank With the help of his now good friend Cazeuenve and his new girlfriend Lucie (Mimsy Farmer) he tries to battle his demons and fight against the troublesome cop.
If you like to listen to interesting comments, like WOW, gee, cool, like oh my god or oh my gosh, amazing, and to top it off, incredible, etc., etc., then this is for you.
It's a campfire tale not meant for roasting marshmallows; a homespun creation myth rendered by the elder which coincides with the sudden departure of the grandfather as the scene's focal point, when the camera tilts down, then passes slowly across an expanse of fire and grassland.
The old man's expiration is represented by a tree, as the camera's ongoing verticality then turns towards the heavens, at the moon, which transforms Don Plutarco into a memory, a voice-over.
To make us feel guilty and cry, and then open our purses and give ?
Finally these people seem to have decided to do what they have to do to be free and then to make the profit of their work stay in their country and help their people, their children.
Unless you can find a resonably priced used copy, then you should definitly buy it!
The movie was PG, so I could get away with watching it then.
Mattie (Paula Trueman), who spends her days sitting by the construction site munching on prunes, witnesses a fatal accident and then conspires with her friends to rig similar accidents to delay the destruction of their home.
I found it to be slow at various points especially when she finally discovers about the stigmata thing and then tries to solve the case.
If she's Aubrey, then why is her delusion that she is Dakota so convincing?
If she's Aubrey, then is there really a Dakota?
If the girl in the hospital is Dakota, then where the hell is Aubrey, and why do these 2 women look identical?
Yes it did have some over the top gory scenes, but isn't that a good thing for adult fans of the genre, i mean how come SAW became so popular and recommended, if you don't like gore then don't watch it, but don't give bad reviews of the film because you are too weak to stomach these scenes, i totally enjoyed it !!!
Considering I was expecting this Lindsay Lohan vehicle to be a tame, teen-friendly Hollywood horror, I was actually rather pleasantly surprised by its absurdity (but then I love Argento films, which rarely make sense).
There are movies that are so bad that they are good...  And then there are movies that are so bad you want to tear your eyes out and burn them, and then mix the ashes with something edible so you can digest and crap them out again...
We like the low budget movies that try so hard, and yet end up being somewhat less then serious.
"Okay, but just so you know, I am going to become a deranged serial killer who will want to punish you by cutting off your playing hand and your foot pedal leg, and then bury you alive in a stain glass coffin."
Oh, and by the way, two weeks after you have abducted me, she is found in a ditch, missing the same limbs that you cut off of me cause of the whole twin stigmata thing, and within a 24-48 hour period, she recovers, is interrogate by the FBI, is outfitted with a fully articulate artificial hand and leg (almost the same type of hand that Ash got in Army of Darkness, imagine that), has insanely wild sex with my boyfriend while my mom scrubs the sink downstairs...  *breathe*  "...And then once she puts it all together that my father, who really isn't my father, bought (as in purchased) me at the hospital from my crack whore birth mother, she confronts him and says the key line "I know who killed me", and comes to find you.
She then proceeds to get locked in a closet and then in a fit of poetic justice (of course) as you are sticking your hand in the door, cuts off your hand with the very same stain glass blue knife which you of course made yourself.
She then proceeds to use the whole stigmata thing to our advantage, finds where I am buried (oops alive of course, cause if I die then she dies) and with her bionic woman powers unearths me and breaks through the glass and then the movie thankfully ends."
Because after this, there will be no more jobs left for her, other then that of a stripper in a seedy low rent strip club.
Douglas kills Mr. Fleming then Dakota kills Douglas and in the nick of time finds Aubrey who was buried underground and digs her out from a shallow grave.
The opening scene shows plastic blacks flying among vultures, and from then on, grainy shots of people, like ants, climbing the piles of garbage, the red sunset, telling a story of pollution, a black river of a putrid liquid with gas coming out of the bubbles, the dogs and the horse against the sunset, side-by-side with a burning garbage can.
If you do decide to spend money to see this movie, send me the cash instead, I will then hit you in the groin, you will enjoy it more.
In the film she has the portrayal of a very rich but cheap tart who seemed to constantly lead Charles along and then let him down.
The documentary, then, focus on her personal history, her daughter, her son (a religion seeker), her "lost" daughter, the abandon of her husband, the rapes she suffered, her frustration with her believes.
It also shows how virginity was still the vogue back then and that all the other provocative women were putting on a show.
The humour then progresses to another person receiving a log up the kilt.
Rated PG for Sexual Innuendos,Language and Teen Smoking/Drinking   Grease is a musical starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton John.I must say, im not really a big fan of the musical genre but there are a few that I enjoy.This is one of them.The songs are pretty catchy and the movie has a fairly good plot.Its a teen film set in the 1950's like American Graffiti and Lemon Popsicle only this is not as serious as those movies.The film is about two teenagers who meet and fall in love over the summer but the girl says she has to move back to Austrailia ending their relationship.But their family seems to have a change of plans and she ends up going to the same school.The only thing is, she's a goody goody girl and the boy she fell in love with is a member of a gang.Graese is a fairly entertaining film and even if you don't like musicals, but like teen films then you should check this one out.
But then there's the main plot line: two youths named Danny and Sandy fall in love one summer, which is just fine in the real world, but once back in high school, they realize they're in different social cliques; he's a greaser and she's a goody-goody.
Teenagers have enough trouble dealing with peer pressure both then and today.
Grease is the story of bad-boy Danny and good-girl Sandy meeting each other over summer break then happen to returning to the same school.
So by now you might be saying, How can you say at that this movie is great and then trash its plot and moral?
Final Synopsis:  Movies : I did see this when I was in high school because it was re-released in the late 90's in theaters but stupid macho me back then didn't care for it.
Usually female newcomers overact like Aish is Aur Pyar Ho Gaya but then she proved in HDDCS that she can act.
If you take this film in the spirit it was made then you should be laughing & groaning in equal measures!
But then one of her heels broke while she and her competitors were warming up.
If you are already a fan of Lano & Woodley then you definitely wont be disappointed.
If you haven't seen much of their material before then this would be a great place to start.
I saw Lano and Woodley live once a couple of years ago in Mount Gambier (where I live, and they were so funny then as well.
And when Woodley just ignores him and puts the fire extinguisher on various parts of Colin's body, going, "I'm going to freeze your back-knees, and then I'm going to freeze your right eye, so when you walk down the street, everyone will look at you and say 'oh, look at him.
He just keeps rambling on about freezing him, and then it turns out that the fire extinguisher is empty, because Colin had been mucking around with it before the show.
First in her beautiful little town in the Veracruz state of Mexico, then Tijuana, followed by LA, and back to her hometown.
Matthieu Chabrol turns out another of his identikit numbers - start off classical piano, add a bit of dissonance, then a bit of pseudo-comic artful jauntiness before collapsing back into classical piano mode - that adds nothing but tedious familiarity to the proceedings.
If it's blood you are fishing for, then you'll catch it, but at what cost?
They get away and then the brats decide to go to a sorcerer to cast a spell for revenge.
Next thing ya know, lover boy has an attack of fish-hooks-erupting-through-the-skinitis and the ol' lady starts going off her nut and they see 'er stickin' 'erself in the leg and then she just sort of goes into the background for a li'l while.
A beautiful teacher Miss Panor has six students.They decide to play a cruel prank on Ms.Panor and her reputation is ruined.The teacher then turns to black magic to exact gruesome revenge.
If torture scenes in Syrianna and Hard Candy made you squirm in your seat, then your stomach is up for more churning, given the previous two films did it more psychologically and with off-camera scenes, whereas here you're not spared the visual details, leaving none to the imagination, even if certain shots might look cheap and unrealistic.
However, if your intention is to get some scares, then this movie still delivers, if you'd be forgiving to the ending.
When the director threatened to remove Benny if he continued this, then Benny decided to stay up all night before he had any scenes with Kilbride because then he was so exhausted that he just didn't care.
While some cynics may not enjoy this movie as much as I do (it is clearly a product of it's time), if you find that you enjoy classic comedies then you should give this one a chance.
The finale, then, has the hero relinquishing (not without a certain remorse) his political career to make up to the long-suffering heroine Â especially since their past dalliance had borne him a son (with whom he also shares his name) he was unaware of.
The film has basically the same story, three friends in the 50's or early 60's keeping up with exams,girlfriends and all the other things that teens go through in high school.If you like teen comedies, then check out the lemon popsicle series.
The second, that with other then the name of bouncing boy being really lame, it's not really about the legion but a shameless hero worship and let's all relay on superman/teen or whatever.
Surely the legion has more talented heroes then the names already given, a lot of the characters are very generic, no defining element?
Again it doesn't help when it's all about superman, if DC wants to expand with their media then they have to do more, not just focus on lesser characters but give those the characters the decent animation drawings, plot and script they need.
If it weren't for 'Midnight Cowboy' who knows..., then maybe 1969 would be the year of 'The Royal Hunt of the Sun'.
This is a great animated feature film.It was so cool to see He-Man and She-Ra and Skeletor and Hordak together!I loved it when He-Man and She-Ra did their transformation after each other near then!
That was wonderful!I loved that!Most of the characters from both series' were in the film and the music was great as always!If you like He-Man and She-Ra then watch this masterpiece.In My opinion this was one of the greatest animated features ever!Just like the series' its a classic and I think it'll be hard for something to top this!I really love this movie and I don't think you'll be disappointed!
I thought back to March of 1985, did the math and realized I am the same age now as my mom was then.
And he soon meets Adora, who just might be the owner of the magic sword...  Back then, when I was a kid, I was very fond of the "He-man and the masters of the universe" show and it's "sequel" "She-ra".
-------------   I then went to watch "The secret of the sword".
She then goes to the chamber where He-man is being held in a special booth.
And then, finally, she takes her sword, transforms herself into She-ra and free's He-man.
Now, if you consider yourself a buff on legend then see this movie, and never see 'First Knight' which was just terrible.
This movie was far more impressive then it's contemporary rival the rather silly (though still enjoyed) Conan the Barbarian.
Tonally the film (purposefully) wanders wildly from darkness to light; the acts are very clearly defined; first the Kingdom is established and flourishes; which leads to betray and the emergence of evil in the second, then in a blistering third act there is a muted sense of forgiveness and resolution.
Among the many elements that make the movie work is the cast: Nigel Terry, the rightful King who, accidentally, removes the sword of power easily, not once, but twice; Helen Mirren, the enchantress Morgana, Merlin's nemesis and Arthur's treacherous half-sister, who seduces Merlin, and then encircles him in a stream of vengeance; Nicholas Clay, persuasively ardent and athletic as the First Knight; Cherie Lunghi, the damsel in distress who loves her husband with her mind and Lancelot with her heart; Nicol Williamson, the wily Merlin who would see that the young Arthur receive the necessary training and guidance to fulfill his unlikely destiny; Gabriel Byrne, the hot-blooded Uther Pendragon, who plunges 'Excalibur' deep into a stone rock in one last act of defiance; Katrine Boorman, the woman taken as by a fully armored King; Liam Neeson, the knight who dares to accuse the Queen; and Robert Addie, the 'unholy child' who comes to Camelot to demand the throne of his father...  One of the more fascinating aspects of the film (and there are many...) are the differences between Uther and Arthur... King Uther is unable to master his instincts... His world is confusion, disorder, and unlimited passion...
Once one has realised that this is not the real world, then the film is internally consistent and works splendidly.
He never misses, and nobody drawns faster then him.
Of course, Lupin always forgives her, because he's crazy for her, but Jigen and Goemon knows she's more trouble then she's worth.
'Oh, and then let's cock-up 'A For Andromeda' in the same spectacular style'!
This movie is more of a Psycho thriller then a Hooror movie and I cant wait to see what Blue Omega has lined up in the future.
DO NOT READ this comment IF YOU WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE>>>>>IT will spoil it for you  This Movie was very good for about the first hour and then the end was like OMG!
Put this flick on the chopping block, watch The Wrestler, and perhaps then you'll remember why Ms. Tomei is an actress, and you may get a bit more enjoyment out of that film than this horribly edited, scripted, and cinematic disaster.
This is a drama/Horror with a little more depth then your average horror..I have seen this movie a few times on cable and saw the screener before it came out.
From a plot standpoint, it really does not take much skill to throw twelve random plots into the mix, and then in the end reconcile all the threads by saying that it was all imaginary.
And then it becomes clear that Marisa Tomei has done a wonderful job!
There was massive build up and it seemed like there would be a big pay off but then the ending ruined the entire movie.
The ending will leave you in somewhat of a stunned silence, and then you will sit there and watch all of the loose ends tie themselves neatly together.
Yes, there are some portions of the film that beg credibility but then that is what delusional thinking is about.
One day he likes Rose and then the next minute he becomes a horrible monster.
I didn't like the fact that it was so short it took me two days to beat and the final boss was the easiest battle in the game with the exception of the beginning random battles.I also want to know how they are going to start golden sun 2 (which should be coming out Christmas 2002 for all you golden sun fans)because if it's a different game pack than golden sun will they start with the average level of the game then factor in everything like spells and Items and then maybe start the game on the boat then have a secret closet where you can pick up any of the weapons you may have had.
Oh and another Idea I have about the continuation of the game is maybe they should make a special device that they they sell in the same box as golden sun 2 to transfer the data of your game ongolden sun then save it to golden sun 2(hint hint people who made the game)and then maybe sell it for 100 bucks and you'd make more money hey that works hunh.
you'll like it if you like games like the final fantasy series and chrono cross and you might buy the game then try those games listed abvove and love them.
It started with the climax of a volcano having an outburst, and having to go save friends until one was swept away in a storm while it was raining...the climax was broken, and then you met the two villains in the game; they noticed you eavesdropping and then they knock you out.
I enjoyed this film very much because in many ways it was a change of pace; it takes the unconventional, homosexual couple and then puts them in a military setting which provides for an interest backdrop to a very human story.
I rented this DVD four days ago and have watched it about 5 times since then.
But then I read that it's supposed to be a good movie with a tender love story; I swallowed and gave it a try.
And then there are Yossi and Jagger Â close friends in the official version, closeted lovers in reality.
Swanson's Norma Desmond slithers within millimeters of lampooning herself, taking huge chances with over-the-top sneers, affected lunges, theatrical posturings, and world-record- breaking narcissism, dangling Norma at the brink of psychosis for the vast majority of the movie, then creeping over.
If you hated something as masterful as The Apartment, then you have a hole where your heart should be.
But then again, classics only get that designation when further times arrive.
This movie, and if you haven't seen it then you really should rush out to grab it IMMEDIATELY, tells of a symbiotically parasitic relationship that develops between an aged film star and a struggling writer.
If more people had reacted the same way as Joe did initially (dismissing Norma and prompting her reply of "I AM big, it's the pictures that got small") then maybe she would have eased back down to earth.
If he'd never actually heard of Norma's fate then he would have been long gone but once it was relayed to him, and still with the fresh memory of the part he played, then he had to make sure that he hadn't done any long-term damage.
Joe is initially hesitant to help the glamorous woman, and then asks $500 a week for his writing services.
The funniest scene in the movie is when Norma rolls on top of Joe while he is reclining on a couch, and then does an imitation of Charlie Chaplin in order to cheer him up; the scene is an uproarious mixture of the sad, the funny, and the pathetic.
We had faces then."
"And then the rains came, over-sized, like everything else in California."
This film closed the door to the old Hollwyood-generation, opened one to the new and basically started a new era in self-conscious film-making and - in the process - reconciled the until then completely forgotten silent film stars.
Erich von Stroheim, now degraded to being Desmond's butler, was largely an outcast by then, just as the totally forgotten Buster Keaton who's allowed to play card games at Desmond's mansion once in a while.
Her sweetness in her "bathing beauty" scene, where she recounts her days in the line with Marie Prevost and Mabel Normand, then leaps onto the sofa beside William Holden -- is so beguiling that you completely understand her sex appeal and warmth (for a moment).
Barely five feet tall, she swept in and immediately established a bodily "line" that commanded attention from then on.
If she's NOT insane then she has knowingly killed Gillis to prevent his leaving her (a STAR)....... Also the shots of Max blinking away tears as Norma descends (supposedly into madness) and also of Hedda Hopper crying are equally as devastating as Norma's speech about "being back" and "all those wonderful people out there in the dark" (which of course includes us every time we watch the film).
If you are after a movie with humour, a touch of romance, and a new twist on the hero undercover cop, then this is the movie.
He seizes a knife... ...and then throws it in the sink and starts cleaning the kitchen frantically, not stopping until it is spotless.
We also have to endure a ridiculous scene where an art lover bleats " If you destroy beauty then we don't deserve to go on living " Oh please !
If the BBC are thinking of doing a live version of QUATERMASS AND THE PIT then my advice is don't .
Charlie is a mess, meets a psychologist who introduces him to group therapy (where Charlie idiotically relates all the DEA secrets openly) and to gastroenterology where nurse Judy (Sandra Bullock) administers a barium enema then other more herbal-sided treatments while she and Charlie become bonded.
If you don't like to have fun then go see the new Time Machine.
If you do like fun then watch Gun Shy.
And to then put words to the screen as successfully as Blakeney has managed himself is really encouraging.
Like, someone got all their out of work hack actor friends together, threw in some family members, and then pulled a few people off the street kind of bad.
But then again, one can hardly blame them when they're being forced to say the most ridiculous lines in the history of people talking to each other.
If you want to burn your eyes out with bleach, then perhaps watch "Viva" instead.
The wild 70s fashions, garishly colorful home decors, and even the party snacks served back then, are meticulously detailed in this film.
If you think you know how well Liza could dance, and how captivating she was on stage, and if you think you know how extraordinary Bob Fosse's choreography & direction could be, and you haven't seen this performance, then you still don't know.
If you are not familiar with movie history, then you do not know that thousands of films have been lost over time, from the silent era onwards.
Some lost movies were even blockbusters in their time but then began to seem dated and were quickly forgotten.
Hopefully, the Internet and sites like IMDb will help to promote near-forgotten gems like Reuben, Reuben, encouraging young movie fans to seek them out and then spread the word of their excellence.
One of my decent prayers to our Lord: The day of resurrection of this lovable study on DVD cometh.I enjoyed it first some 13 years ago in MÃ¼nster, Westfalia.Since then ,I have seen it probably 50 times or so.
(Check out some 1960s Minnelli recordings like "Come Saturday Morning" - her voice was much higher and sweeter then than we're used to.)
Others will see themselves as Frodo, having to go through a time of not only global(outter)-conflict, but inner as well, as they travel through that time and end up changed, and then have to move on past the troubled times they've triumphed over.
I hated the opening sequence at rivendell then the flashback to the story which didn't even start when 'The Lord of the Rings' ended and that was why the movie was made so it could finish the story.
Anywho, my advice to everyone is that if you want a good laugh check out the first one (LOTR) and if you seek torture then by all means, see the Return of the King.
Go see the movie, then you'll really be confused.
The characters are then thrown headlong into a poorly animated rendition of the last book of the story, through a blazing and mainly incomprehensible series of events which make no sense unless you've either read the actual book, or are psychic and can pull plot points out of the aether.
i think Liza was a star that really made it to the top...and then some.
If you read my review on the Hobbit, then you know that the artistry lacks a little.
But then, we might not have wanted to see Legolas since in the Hobbit, they portrayed Elves with blue skin, very long ears and pointy fingers.
The footage was then studied and brilliantly rotoscoped, so that it actually looks like there are citizens of Minas Tirith cheering on the coming of their King!
This, then, was the power behind The Return of the King --- a simple, straightforward saga that would not bow to the attitudes of so-called sensationalism, but would nevertheless be the only Tolkien adventure that one could truly believe in.
And then, as the world knows by now, came a man named Peter Jackson.
If you ever had the chance to watch more than one episode from a mexican soapbox opera, then you've seen this movie already.
Most part of the actors are from the soapbox opera mafia that controls our TV media -which means they can hardly act-, so I should've been warned by that; but then, thereÂ´s also in La habitaciÃ³n... a couple of good actors -like DamiÃ¡n AlcÃ¡zar- that I enjoy watching at work.
But then again, it seems that mediocrity -starting from the directorÂ´s own- surpassed by much the talent of the few brilliant involved, so the result is a boring movie that even some people have the nerve to call "a thriller".
then where was the thrill?
Important events in the story are then played out by the characters.
The story of an African American, women (colored then), devoted to a single parented, white women that had taken her in and her "white" looking "black" daughter (if you add two drops of chocolate syrup to a glass of milk, is it chocolate milk?
If you wish to know what a filmmaker thinks about the film as a whole as opposed to the significance of the subject, then please read on.
Their business becomes such a success that it gets franchised into a chain of coffee shops that market Delilah's waffle recipe and then turns into a major business venture producing the waffle mix en masse.
If the reverse is true for girls, then Jessie falling for Steve kind of indicates that he's the right guy for Bea.
Peola is missing from school somewhere down in Virginia / Bea then tells Steven she must soon assist in the search / But there is Jessie / Who complicates matters and leaves Steven deep in the lurch.
If you have enough of FX loaded movies that cover their thin plot with a multitude of explosions, then give it a try.
It does hurt me to see her turn against and deny her mother as the movie ends, but when her mother then dies, it's even more sorrowful that Peola never has the chance to tell her, "Yes I did love you and I should have claimed you as my mother from the start" For anyone who loves a warm, heartfelt classic, you should certainly see Imitation of life (The year 1934)
This other woman discovers and exploits Delilah's knowledge, first on a small then on a very large scale.
However, if you like romance stories, alot of shagging from different points of the world, and above all, Woody himself then this is your movie!
And then of course there is Tony Randall and the whole brain scene.
But then...
Next he goes to a pool party and gets in a fight with a jock then slaps a girl across the face.
I liked the idea of the invocation which added some supernatural and demonic tone to the movie but then the movie soon starts to fall to the typical "revenge of the geek" slasher flick.
As he ranted on in these pointless monologues, a flicker of a true actor popped up every now and then (granted, probably on accident.)
In fact, there was more ax-wielding in the opening credits then anything else.
For some reason, it cuts to a party scene at the professors house and Jeffery says something ridiculous, pushes a girl into the pool, then David fights with him for a while, i had a hernia, and then Jeffery drives off in a fury, David follows him, and Jeffery ends up dying.
'cause I want one then !
the monster is invisible, the hero makes traps and then waits on a tree, the monster has heat seeking vision and the monster looks a lot like the predator.
you must see the movie more then once,then you will get the real filling of the movie.the movie is very good also from the professional side,the photography the music everything.everything is happening by the most beautiful lake the Ohrid lake in the mountain and national park in Macedonia.the crew is perfect from Pasic to Paunovic from Mirjana to Sinisa.i m very impressed with the acting of Pasic i think it is a masterpiece.and by the way is co-production of all ex Yugoslavian republics(its not a joke)..............................................more times you see the movie it gets better.
The tears, the laughs... my kids actually were far more into this movie then they were the original.
However if you like bad movies then watch this one and suffer like the rest of us.
But it always bugged me in Bambi, that in one scene his mother dies and his father takes him away, and then, in next scene Bambi is big and everybody is happy.
After bidding a tearful farewell to her favorite leopard (which is shown making choked-up faces when she walks away) she sets sail for Hong Kong with Mighty Peking Man chained to the deck of the ship, and from then out out it's more or less like "King Kong" only funnier.
Strange that Ah Wei communicates with Kong in "native language" in the jungle but then in English towards the end, maybe he's as fast a learner as she is.
That was one of the most wonderful things about the first movie ...even more than sixty years after it's release, the songs were so well written that they sound just as good now as they did then.
Imagine my surprise, then, at the quality of Bambi 2.
Mary Frann (Dick's wife) & others would then wake you up.
This then becomes a wonderful series, far above average, and worth the watch.
4/10 (it at least had good cinematography) or How to Win an artsy film prize: Make a film that's suffocatingly deep, allegedly meaningful, partially immersed in quasi-mysticism then throw in some contemporarily realistic elements in an exotic setting but do make sure the leading characters are offbeat in some way (in this instance gay & Thai.).
One of the "sweded" films in Be Kind Rewind, this starts out as a ripoff of King Kong, then switches to a Tarzan movie as Johnny (Danny Lee) discovers Samantha (Evelyne Kraft), an absolutely gorgeous babe that was raised by The Peking Man after her parents died in a plane crash.
So this is the trick to the film; if one doesn't know how to see with the heart, or if the film doesn't touch one's heart creating an explosion that obliges the heart to start "seeing" independently of whether we want to or not, then the film will appear as a mediocre whatever thing.
When Keng finally makes a move in such a way, as to be beyond any doubt of a desire for intimacy (he kisses Tong's hands), Tong responds in turn by doing the same, and then walks into the darkness of the forest.
The spirit of the shaman was then stuck as half tiger half man and eternally doomed to stalk the forest; tricking and devouring all in it's path.
Keng, is then on patrol in his section of the forest, exploring rumors from villagers, about some "thing" killing cattle and causing general havoc.
Keng asks Tong if he can lay in his lap and Tong says "no", then a minute later, he changes that to "no problem".
So first it confuses you and then it puts you off.
If you've gotten to this comment, then you've read multiple times by now how the main character is "bullet proof" maybe "flame retardant" or even invincible.
And then there's the "comic relief," which mainly consists of Anthony Ray Parker's character whining about having to do stuff or telling some lame story that makes "Who's Your Caddy?"
If John Cena ever wins an Oscar (presumably the same year that gravity is disproved) it would be for the best animatronics in a movie, although I think that he still has less emotional range then that talking tree from "The Lord of the Rings."
wow, i've seen something worse then cena's wrestling, his acting!
and then...cena has an epic battle with the main villain everyone thought was dead!
And towards the end when Triton surely kills Rome in the blast, then after reviving his wife, Rome suddenly rises again with severe burns and then Triton kills him for good, VERY VERY B movie, if you ask me.
If this guy was serious, and the way he wrote it would imply so, then we're in dire need of some obligatory school lessons about funny action movies 2) Pure '80 fun.
3) Let me tell you that if this movie's what's so great about America, then America must really stink as nation.
We argued the pros and cons of watching it and then she agreed (or gave in, I don't remember).
A teacher then goes after the lost girls.
If you're looking for a dreamlike escapade or something to soothe you to sleep then perhaps this film is for you.
Though, it's considered one of the simplest forms in the universe, organic virus's attach burrow into your cells and attach themselves to the RNA, then change your own RNA code.
In fact the one argument in their favour - that replacing the one train with loads of bus routes and motorways would have huge environmental concerns and destroy the countryside - is mentioned once and then forgotten about; it seems that we're supposed to support them simply because, well, they want to run a railway and it's quite a nice hobby.
Whereas I give this only one star out of then, it earns that one star for its try and its pretty pictures.
The lines were dumb especially when Ociee Nash met the president and fell down when nobody moved out of her way, then saying a little later to the president her opinion of "hurrying slowly" which the president and everybody there found to be a great idea.
If that's all you need then tune in, but when it first aired in America, few did, and it ranked 152nd out of the 156 original series produced for network television in the 2005-06 season Â and was then dropped after eight episodes.
Soldiers at checkpoints are instructed not to fire at the head of an approaching Palestinian unless it is clear that their own lives are in danger; the method, according to my friend, is to provide a warning shout, fire into the air or around the area, and then if all else fails, shoot in the leg and then interrogate and hospitalize.
I waited for another 20 minutes and by then i was so frustrated that I started reading reviews on IMDb and realized that the director has wasted precious time of so many people.
And then...
To get revenge, she seduces, drugs and then chains her attacker up in a secret room behind a one-way mirror where he must watch in sexual frustration as she taunts and teases him with a parade of men and women she brings home to play with.
The settlers the men died for don't even have the decency to bury them and then the final straw was the kid throwing his gun away after the burial.
So I really don't get it (or maybe just let down) when I see something that has been given great resources and it's not even nearly the best it could be..Specifically, when I see a movie that has had a decent budget thrown at it and it turns out mediocre (at best)..well, it's just too bad...someone fell down somewhere...I think in this case it was a combination of people not giving it their all...starting with the screen writing and then dribbling down to the casting...then onto the direction and the actors themselves...it's just not as good as you would hope for (especially with the great movie name, again)... and that's all I gotta' say about that....F...F.G.
Honestly, I got more entertainment out of watching fish then this film.
Too bad it contains so many internal references to norwegian characters and surroundings as these jokes then will be somewhat lost to foreigners, but there's still lots and lots left.
In other words, if you like laughing at films such as PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, then this film is definitely for you!
I particularly loved it when two of the bad girls just told a crook that they shot a cop---and then this crook picks up the phone and tries to call the police!
If you aren't the sort of person who likes to do this, then my advice is to steer clear!
But their misfortunes actually start when they do camp in an allegedly abandoned cabin that's not so empty they think; then the terror really begins.
I don't like it when I have seen a great actor many great movies and in many great roles and then some director or someone has them in role that makes them a total joke and I don't care if the actor agreed to it or not it shouldn't be done in My opinion!
I think the coolest scenes was when Mario Lopez, then that 2nd guy (baby daddy) discovered the girl lying beautifully in the woods and realizing that her head was on backwards.
There are so man other good Zombie movies out there then this one.
Lets take an example: a girl sees her dad go ape sh_t and then eat her mother.
Its like one minute you will see the survivors talking by a car, then it will cut to a desert setting with them talking about how the infection started, then cut back to the same people somewhere else by the same car they left.
Its like it was made without a director and the people responsible just filmed a load of crap they thought might work and then threw it together in movie maker.
If you're an enormous fan of Willis O'Brien and his work, then do watch this film as it contains some of the best integration of stop-motion animation and live action you'll see in any film.
Normally I don't like to see a movie more then 1 or 2 times, but Flaaklypa is different!
Sometimes you get a movie which is below average throughout but then the last 15 minutes are as if it has been directed by someone else and it suddenly grabs your attention.
If you like realism then i wish you luck when watching this movie... and worse still it sucked 3 hours of my life away!
With a fine director like Robert Siodmak, I expected a better movie but then again, all of the Freudian nonsense usually turns me off.
But it's a bit more then that.
It's a big mistake trying to make this film funny but then spending millions in special effects that looked cheap but weren't meant to.
Check out the character of Randolf who starts off by speaking in a scouse accent then when he gets found out reverts to an Australian accent .
If this was meant to work as some laugh-your-way-through-life's-troubles allegory, then a vehicle more appropriate than the greatest genocide ever perpetrated by man against man should have been chosen as the vehicle.
If it weren't for a goofball romantic subplot ala Top Gun, then this would rate double what I gave it.
But then I may be a bit biased as I was forced to view this movie, I didn't watch it by choice.
Apparently most of the movie's budget was spent on transporting crew and equipment to Zimbabwe for a few outside shots, then back to the LA Public Library (aka Temple of Gold) to shoot the important scenes.
It looks like it is going to be a cheap action movie, but one packed with enough thrills to keep one entertained, and then they make it to the city of gold and the movie just stops being entertaining.
There's not much gold on display in the lost city either, but then Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of White doesn't really have the same ring to it.
Isaac Hayes seems to be cast only for the joke of being billed as "The Chef," and then disappears after three short scenes.
However, there he is, in scene after scene, in filthy clothing, telling people that their ass stinks, and then throwing himself pity parties because the other kids don't like him.
And then there shall be blackness.
Seriously this movie was a comedy not a horror movie ...to me anyways lol  Too bad I can't go any lower then a 1 otherwise this would get a -0 from me.
The lead actor is terrible, he cannot act, in fact none of them can act, Suplee does what he does best, plays weirdos and Mewes is doing the same role as usual, it's the sort of film that had been written in a day and then filmed over two days, it is that bad.
If you are an artsy fartsy type, then you may like this film, or you may just say you like the film to make yourself appear cultured, but you are only fooling yourself.
His character doesn't seem long he belongs in this movie but, then again, neither did anyone else, neither did I and neither do you.
If you forgot why you hated clowns then this will remind you why.
Smith has to be a nice guy, because then he helped few Jersey friends with their projects.
Even then, the film leaves a permanent residue.
Other women flirt with Drum, but shy Evie can only take a quick photograph of him and then in a strange (and, I found, hard to believe) act, carve his last name on her forehead with broken glass.
I was about 7 years then.
But he's not alone: A police detective makes a strong appearance then vanishes from the film too.
YOUNG SOUL REBELS is basically the same , it starts with a murder in a park then spends most of its running time going out of its way not to be a murder thriller except for the last five minutes which reveals who the murderer is .
I have not seen any of those, but still I urge you all out there, if you ever get the chance to see this wonderful movie, then DO IT!!!
ok theyre telling me i need more then 10 lines so ill go on.
and then the end just when u think things couldint get any worse they do.
This is just a Q&A with DeSalvo in prison, with flashbacks to his crimes, and it seems to try and say that DeSalvo may not have been the mass murderer, The actors and acting are dire, the direction is awful, i have no idea what he was seeing through the lens, how could you get a bunch of actors like these to make a film believable, in the original movie Tony Curtis played DeSalvo,with a career best performance, really an Oscar performance, and it shows what a great actor he was back then, Henry Fonda as a law professor, brought in to find the killer, and George Kennedy as the detective, these were Stella performances.
If a person makes allowances for this, which I am personally willing to do, then the movie has some strong points.
If we're given this fictional subplot, then it needed to be developed better.
He plays Anthony, the earnest and honest follower who would rather settle down and find love then get involved in illegal activities.
The movie then goes on and on and I don't care anymore, I just want it to be over.
But then again, that's why masterworks are masterworks, and everyone else are mere mortals.
On the other side of the equation, Uma looks her age and then some, and why a 23 year old (with none of the maturity necessary to even appreciate an older woman) would be drawn to her is also baffling.
If you have really nothing better to do (like me at the time) then watch the film if you must.
And then the ending is so abrupt you are left there wondering why you just wasted an hour and 40 minutes on this film-seriously I want that time back in my life.
I was enjoying it for the first 20 minutes, and then I was put to sleep.
If Younger can get a budget and A-list cast for his pedestrian, misogynistic "comedy," then there's hope for those with actual talent!
I NEVER thought I'd say this in my life, but if this is your cup of tea, then go watch Underground Comedy Movie instead.
nicholson broke up with his young girlfiend early in the movie, then we had to wait what seemed like hours as nicholson predictably, slowly developed enthusiasm for keaton.
and then at the end the physician abruptly removed himself from the scene in paris.
If you are an avid film enthusiast and want to have light bulbs appear over your head in regards to finding our where things came from in some major Hollywood productions, then you should watch this film.
There's Ms. Puke-face who dates Mr. Lays-all-the-chicks who falls for Ms. Post-Meno-Mom, but wait Ms. Puke-face bows out so that the two STARS can romance each other and then along comes Dr. Do-right who ALSO bows out (talk about a non-Alpha-male type) in Paris (no less) so the Geritol-set couple can finally after two tedious hours ... who cares?
I'd rather be made sit through one Mad Mel's recent films then ever watch this bloated, rotting corpse of a film ever again!
Story elements -- for example, turning the group of captive women into magic temptresses with poisonous breath -- get introduced and then dropped, or brought back for a few seconds' cameo at best (the poisonous women turn out quite pathetic, achieving only one kill among them).
It felt like some middle-schooler penned the screenplay and then suckered all of his or her family members to go through these horrible, horrible motions.
But if you want to watch a Van Wilder movie without Van Wilder in it then go ahead.
If this sort of humor is appealing to you, then you'll enjoy this movie.
If film making was a crime, then Mort Nathan is a murderer and MGM the people who handed him the pistol.
It you manage to keep your eyes open to witness the horror of celluloid, then be prepared for the post-traumatic stress disorder you will develop following this film, with flashbacks of badly acted college students with no emotional depth haunting your dreams.
The two biggest jokes in "Van Wilder" consisted of the seamstress sight gag at the beginning and then the very vulgar prank where a rival fraternity gobble pastries spiked with the seminal fluids of a well-endowed bulldog.
And even then, I was forcing it just because I felt like I forked down $10, and if I didn't even laugh once, I'd have been bamboozled of my money.
He had at least moderate buzz going for him after a string of decent performances, and then releases this nonsense.
But then like a toaster dropped into the bathtub of my life, 3 Ninjas: High Ninja Mountains Hyper, changed it all.
The movie starts with the 3 hero's doing a pretty cool obstacle course at their grandfather's place but learn a valuable lesson when he turns off the power and then makes them attempt it backwards.
I was 12 when I first watched this and I thought it was awful then as well.
The first two movies were cute, the third was...blech, but when a movie stars Hulk Hogan.... slow up on that, you've already lost all the money that you put into this flop; and then some.
I have luckily escaped seeing any of the Rugrats movies, and have watched the series now and then with my kids.
There are a few pop culture references there simply for the parents (and then, some parents are too young to appreciate them...I swear I was the only one in the theater who "got" the Poseidon Adventure reference...perhaps the other parents were still in diapers when that movie came out in the 70s...) but other than that not too thrilling.
Unless you wanna be responsible for ruining the Americas, then please stop with gay shows like Your Mother.
Not that they are bad actress's, they just deserve better then this.
But then, just as he has burned every single bridge imaginable, he meets and falls madly in love with the girl of his dreams.
The writing is BAD, some of the jokes are funny but then it gets old quickly, and the killer, concealed by a bee screen, can actually be seen!
Thats more then there are people in Norway.
As is typical for this type of film the script was probably five pages long with most of it consumed with "...then there was a long drawn out silence...".
But I can't recall anything much about it - too many other books since then.
If not, then why the sudden kissing and hugging?
it's a great movie!I loved it!I am not to old but I may answer a few questions...the kidnappers hijacked the VPs plane because it was more important then another plane.They did not use a bomb because they wanted something(the fellow terrorist to be released)...if they had used a bomb of course they didn't have to tell because everyone would know what to do(capture them or stop the bomb).I totally agree with Michael Mays!Maybe if people would not want to see an EXTRA MOVIE then they would like it...it's a great movie if you know how to enjoy good films.Of course it borrows something from 4 movies but come on it is great the way it is.I liked the acing especially the terrorists.
If that's a shadow, then so am I.
Even my husband, who is not a fan of the books, didn't want to keep watching it (we tuned out after about 45 minutes and then looked in twice more for about two minutes each), purely because the script was so wooden (oh, for the lyricism of Le Guin's original prose!)
If you have seen it then you have my sympathy - take your revenge and vote!
If you haven't seen it then prepare yourself to watch a movie so bad it makes "Gigli" seem like "Gone With The Wind".
Obviously I didn't have to waste my precious hours on this inanity and then more time following it up with this effort to save you your hours; but note to BBC director general; McCinsey's Island into TV licenses of Â£150 or whatever it is, does not go!
Is that the insane plot about Hulk Hogan's "retired" secret agent finding a treasure map on the back of a turtle and then following it?
The female characters are either weak (the woman who won't let go of the boyfriend who shot and killed her, then continues to hunt and hurt her after she's dead) or absurdly strong (the character that refers to men needing to grow a pair, prove their manliness by killing, etc).
But, if you are not a fan of Jack Black, then avoid this movie like the plague.
The movie goes no where fast, has a small up lift with the black box theatre style of the dinner, then continues on a downward spiral.
On the soundtrack two voices can be heard, a Dr. Barker (Shirley Cameron, the IMDb listing is definitely wrong as her character's name is Mrs. Barker not Mrs. Cameron which is obviously her real name) & a Mr. Hodge (Max Phipps) who talk about Kate's conditioning & that she is a completely different woman from that of a week ago... Thirst then cuts back to presumably a week ago when Kate was just an normal Australian living a normal life who is about to take an extended holiday on her own as unfortunately her architect boyfriend Derek Whitehall (Rod Mullinar) is too busy at work to join her.
If you have absolutely nothing else to do, then do watch this short and you'll see automatically how things had declined for this type of comedy during the "cold war" rock and roll era of the late 50's.
The first 20 to 30 minutes is bearable then this movie is LIKE a DRAG!
I think the movie would be MORE ENJOYABLE then.
If this is a Comedy then it's the worst I've ever seen.
The hippie bunch end up molesting a local girl and then shacking up in an abandoned hotel.
i have no idea why that should be a justification for keeping him captivated, torture him for weeks and then cripple him for life, but alright.
if you take a look at the guinea pig series then even in the genre of wannabe-snuff-movies this example is just a very lame attempt to even reach those limits.
Curly responds, "Yeah, and then we-all can get married!"
then he begins to read it to her, in Hebrew, and teach her Hebrew.
If it is based on a true story, then it took far to long to tell, and it just wasn't worth it.
I found this movie, brain numbing more then anything else.
The supporting cast is also terrible, i really cant comment much on them other then saying that most of them would have been best suited in daytime TV dramas.
When Danny was with his friend attempting to shoot at a Jewish couple, he finds he can't/won't do it, and then his Hebrew cloth is revealed to his friend who realizes he's Jewish.
Danny then shoots at him and leaves the area........OK.....Soooo what happens to his friend?
Father kidnaps son from mother and then helps mother re-kidnap him from primitive Arab tribe who have managed to place elaborate warning boxes into the, one assumes, well guarded mansions of the two parents in America.
No, instead this goes on and on and then we get to see Gould make a confession while a fly is walking around on his face.
the movie was actually that bad.....Yes it is one of the worst movie ever it is non horror at all , should be a thriller of a low grade and never be made as horror at all .True that the plot start promising but i just lost all interest after 29 minute of hardly trying to keep my eyes open ....why you ask >>>well thats a Thai movie who tries to capture a phenomena that happen to turn it to supernatural base it is purely cultural which is OK an all but the movie have set Zero effort to place any fear There is suspense I give u that but overall the film could have been made into a much better film and in my own review i say the idea is great but the display is very very poor just give it try when u have time to kill and u are Bored so just by then knock yourself out lol
If you really hate someone, then buy them this movie for their birthday.
This would then provide motivation for Terry to again take action.
If somebody knows a hundred odd things about Italian cinema then it must be assumed that that person must surely have heard of Gianni Amelio.He is a great figure of Italian auteur cinema having made important films like Colpire al cuore,Il Ladro di bambini,Lamerica and CosÃ¬ ridevano.It is sad to state but a hard to digest truth is that "Le Chiavi di casa" is a film for which Gianni Amelio has failed miserably.There are elements in this film which have the potential to emotionally stir a viewer but they do not have any effect as they are presented in a disconnected manner.This is a film about a father and his troubled relationship with his invalid son but so many questions are left unanswered.It is not sure whether this film is favoring invalid children or is just showing fake sympathy.Casting for the film has not been done properly.There are times when "Le Chiavi di casa" appears as a pathetic euro pudding as it features an English actress Charlotte Rampling sharing screen space with an Italian actor Kim Rossi Stuart in Germany.
And then all of a sudden, here she is falling for a married man.
They slept together and then boom!
Like Karyn for example, mind you.... a woman who met a guy in the elevator then ends up having sex on the same night will always be a woman of bad reputation in Christian Philippines.
If Grissom is really off the show then I won't be watching anymore and neither will my friends and millions of others who made the show #1 for so many years.
If you're like me, and can enjoy a Western but not particularly a fan, then ignore it.
Just from slightly different angles, but it was amusing when we first saw the exterior of the police station, and then later the cop is driving to the Natascha McElhone's apartment and WOW, it's the same building.
If the terrorist on the phone walked everywhere the lead character did, then why on earth didn't the terrorist just do the job?
It was the acting.Perhaps if there was a better script then maybe it would have been a better movie.
Oh, sure, now and then I do enjoy a good horror flick (this isn't one) and was in the mood to watch some mindless goop.
Yet he then became well enough to go and finish... blah blah blah.
But then after the first major death scenes and Dorff decides to check out the website himself, the movie starts to go downhill.
By then, it was pretty obvious, that this is a bad movie.
Also, if you die of your worst fear, as the female lead later revealed, then getting hit by a subway train was this guy's worst fear???
Well, they all died 48 hours after logging into the site FEARDOTCOM.COM....yes, it's feardotcom.COM  Sounds like the ring eh, well it is and it isn't, because with the Ring, you get more into the reasoning behind the video tape, in this movie you have some guy filming himself killing people, then people die from their worst fear after going to feardotcom....sorry feardotcom.com.
Notice I'm talking about other films, other then FEATDOTCOM, that's how bad it is.
I mean they threw that bit in there about finding the body, but then when it was found, it didn't count for anything!
So they manage to save the girl, but then the mad scientist shoots Dorff, and then stabs McElhone then Dorff grabs a keyboard and logs into feardot.com which drives the mad scientist so mad - he dies from fear!
Christopher Holden(Gary Cooper), outbids the trader and then frees her.
His character has problems to deal with, but they are revealed in one moment and then that scene is forgotten.
If that is why he is so perplexed about how to be happy, then it should have been a persistent look on his face, an explanation that is revealed as to why he does things so differently than the rest of us.
Why for instance does the mother spend considerable time sewing a tutu for Toss and then blithely let her go out and play in the filthy, muddy outdoors in it?
He seemed to just show up on their doorstep, well-dressed and professional, and then basically go batty.
I'd say, "Well, then there's nothing for you to worry about."
"Blood and Concrete" is a lame little low budget comedy about a small time hoodlum (Zane) who hooks up with a neurotic babe (Beals) and then learns they have something more in common than mutual admiration...specifically a drug called "Libido".
Playing out like something contrived by a bunch of drunken college students, this flick invents wacky characters and then has them pop up as necessary to sustain it as it dogs its way through its meager plot.
I spied, with my one good eye...  Billy Zane: being held at gun-point, while some thong-clad Brian Bosworth clone orders him to remove his pants and then chases him around the dining room table.
Our favorite looney tune is cruising somewhere on the pacific ocean, finally hitting some beautiful peaceful island... until a Japanese soldier comes up and they have a fight, first on the ground, then up in the air.

In Japanese story, a playful Toni Colette yells out "Last One In Is a rotten egg, then jumps in the water", her Japanese friend pursues her, jumps into the water, and promptly has a fatal accident.
That's 35 of the most dragged-out minutes in film history detailing every trivial aspect involved in getting a dead body back to Queensland, then her interaction with fellow co-workers, family, and necessary outsiders.
Showing the mundane and seemingly inconsequential becomes the focus and is seen as genius because any hack director can have a plot written, then tell a story.
For Collette's character to give in to his demands so easily after having said her piece about not going out there, and then to complain about what he did to them out there, and then not to explain why she even has this job and what it really means - might have been a much more interesting film if the Japanese guy had to find his own way around, and had met a strange woman in the desert with whom he plays, instead of having this geologist lead the way.
The first part of it was boring as hell, then the second half was just plain God damn depressing.
And the movie was just *starting* to get good, he was just starting to loosen up and enjoy himself and then he dies ... and it goes even more downhill from there than when it started - hard to believe but true.
Especially the sex scene when the woman takes off her clothes, then puts HIS pants on?
for the next 20 minutes i just see someone is digging, and a few lines coming from someone's mouth, then followed by goodnight sleep.
If this is one of the pivotal movies in Australian cinema (Along with Somersault and Look Both Ways, which made me want to eat my own legs) then i will cry.
neither did i) then they are like "we are so happy together.....then he dies, oh no, then she tries to get his slippery and slimy corpse back into the car for like half an hour.
then he gets sent home and she looks at the plane for about 5 hours and cries.
No, Japanese pants are not different; Yes, the love scene was horrid; No, you don't die jumping only 4 feet with ARMS EXTENDED in ANY swimming hole; Yes, the background music was interesting for about 30 seconds and then quickly became unbearable.
All the other elements were fine, but if I'm not engaged by the story then I stop caring, and eventually lose interest, which is what happened when I saw this at the festival.
Man B then blackmails Man A and Woman B.
Lucinda is not stupid and can easily find out by just checking where the phone number belongs to, the bottom of the barrel Astor Hotel, that the heel is putting her on in order to fleece her out of a couple of hundred thousand dollars and then , with Charlene, check out of town like the two did a number of times to impressionable old but rich widows.
Norm starts to put the squeeze on the two blackmailing sleaze balls by first planting a bomb in their car, thats not powerful enough to kill them, just to get their attention and then somehow gets involved with Lucinda.
The movie then really goes off the deep end of reality when we then see Gene and the man for all seasons-like Norm, who we were just lead on to believe was killed, in a restaurant looking at a number of hot photos of his wife and Scott in bed together giving us the impression that Gene knew all about Lucindas cheating on him and that Norm was really working for him right from the start!
This all makes you think if those involved with the movie ever bothered to even read the script and then seeing how ridicules it is would have just walk off the set and not come back unless major changes were made.
If you liked the first one too, then you'll be disappointed with this one and it has nothing to do with the first one so I wouldn't buy this movie if I were you unless you find it on the clearance or sales rack.
prevent all of the actions portrayed in the movie from happening... then again, it IS only a movie... but it went beyond the line).
To make matters worse the acting's more wooden then Buford Pusser's fabled 2 by 4.
There are so many plot points that are introduced as big moments but then never play out to any significance that I left the theater extremely irritated by _Lucy Keyes_.
He defied all odds against him, saving his own leg, ripping out the IV tube from his arm, and and then immediately rushing off to the very country that had an arrest warrant against him for attempted murder, just because his cause for saving the sharks was more important than his health, leg or life in prison... For these reasons I found this movie extremely pathetic.
Much seemed to be staged or shot separately and then cut together.
It's like the first five minutes of Chaplin's later Essanay short A WOMAN--but instead of then transitioning to a plot, this film just stays stuck in slapstick mode.
Corrine doesn't die until 'If there be Thornes' which is the third book in the series and even then she is allowed to redeem herself a little by saving Cathy.
So, after flying across the Pacific, stopping over in Taipei and then landing in the Philippines, Adam is perplexed when his mother does not meet him at the airport.
The nasty, bitchy fellow on the other end of the cell phone ( that was cleverly inserted into his luggage just before he left the airport on arrival ), alternately harangues him about being a good Muslim and then threatens to murder his mother.
But then again, I took the time to screen this film on DVD twice, because I wanted to be sure that it wasn't just the herky-jerky camera work which was upsetting me.
"Cavite" invites and involves, but it doesn't deliver 'the goods,' at the end, which is really a false ending and then the viewer is forced to endure a flat-out dead end.
), who teams up with Sean Penn (her then husband) to search for "Faraday's Flowers", a cache of opium balls she hopes can be used as a pain killer for wounded troops.
If, for some reason, you are ever unfortunate enough to find a copy of this little "gem" on the shelf of your local video store, the only thing I can recommend is that you slowly and carefully turn yourself around, then run, run!
After an OK opening (without Sean Penn and Madonna), this falls completely apart, weighed down by lethargic attempts at screwball comedy and no chemistry whatsoever between the leads (then a married couple).
At first I hated the Fanny performance - and then I remembered that I hated Fanny, so she was also perfect.
It is quite obvious that this movie was made quickly on a low budget (I hope) and was expected to make its money back on its opening weekend and then quickly move to video.
Even then they couldn't patch together a watchable film.
I was laughing and turning my head a lot more times in this one then I was on the edge of my seat - except when I was ready to turn the movie off!
But then one of the industry's greatest failings is that it takes itself far too seriously, so perhaps it's not so surprising after all.
If this is liberation then women should be weary.
This is the when the titillation begins as we get to see Phoebe nude bathing and all of a sudden Willie's characters only interest is getting into Phoebe's pants and then turns into a spoiled adolescent who isn't getting his way.
And then i turned it off and feel much better now for having done so.
And then there was the predictability of the whole story.
He then runs away to work as a labourer on a pier where he impresses his co-workers with his heavy sack lifting prowess, causing them to suspect him to be a formidable fighter (dont quite know how that works but never mind).
All in all then, a below-average kung-fu film lifted several huge notches due to you-know-who.
apparently this person has dived on his own in open water, like the submariner, and therefore can tell you exactly what it must be like to be stranded   guys like this will tell you they are ex navy seals and then be so rubbish at diving that they'll kick coral to smithereens (true story)   personally i'm not sure why even a semi-factual attempt was made at this story.
The movie then goes on to show them floating there, and trying to make it seem suspenseful at times.
I've seen some REALLY great shark movies, but then some that were not so great and with my knowledge of shark films, this looked decent... my knowledge was never so wrong.
And then when she submerges herself I said, "Is that it?
And then, fade to black.
Some of the deleted scenes reinforce this point as we're subjected to a scene that shows the alarm going off, the characters laying in bed, struggling to wake up, and then a 30 second shot slowly closing in on the ceiling fan.
If you are a die hard fan of Abhishek and Rani, then probably you can see the movie, but as a package, the movie falls flat.
And then the plot shifts gears: While discussing a passage from Shakespeare's "Richard II" (which probably has a symbolic bearing on the story) Milland and his students hear sirens.
There were moments that made us laugh, but then those moments just fizzled out.
During the party Lana finds Katie dead & when the body is found the police accuse her & two other Omega Kappa girls of the murder, to clear themselves the girls have to turn detective to unmask the real killer & save Omega Kappa's reputation & them from going to prison...  Also known under the better sounding title of Pretty Little Devils this was directed by Irving Rothberg I wasn't sure what to expect from this going into it but even then I thought this was pretty poor stuff that feels like a thrown together mix of several genres none of which are done justice here.
For the first half of Legacy it feels like some teen comedy like American Pie (1999) with college kids getting up to various risquÃ© things like one guy filming him & his girl having sex & showing to his friends or a girl jacking a guy off & then rubbing the cum on her fingers over a fat geeky girls lips all set in the usual clichÃ©d sorority & frat house with the usual clichÃ©d character's like the air-headed bimbo, the geeks they pick on & the jock style lads who think about nothing but sex & beer.
Then there's the expected twist ending which isn't much of a twist as some random character is revealed to be the killer & then it ends.
And then in rides Stingaree (Richard Dix), a highwayman new to the province, who is already a legend elsewhere in Australia.
If the latter is true, then why aren't they trying to change?
I just finished watching all 3 seasons and for the most part I thought it was good, season 1 was great, then season 2 introduced the George Hearst situation which after building up for 2 seasons I felt was a really crap finale: I mean Hearst hired 50+ Pinkertons whilst finally getting Mrs Ellsworth to sign over her claim, so Al Swearengen sent off for reinforcements, (Mr Wu's men and Hawkeye's men) but then Hearst just up and left!!!??
Since then, each member; Benny G, Tommy Boy, Bobby Mac, Carl and Corey split ways, with many stuck in ruts and jobs they loath.
If you're a fanboy of Molloy/Robbins, then there may be some value in this flick, but for pure entertainment value Boytown falls short.

Countless times Sam would talk about an aspect of space and then somehow find a way to link it to the end of the world...then comes the dramatic music and a 3D model of the Earth blowing up.
Fortunately I have seen it first as a (by then openly gay) movie-addict in my twenties, so I could dismiss it as only an embarrassingly bad film.
There WERE realistic toupees even then.
And then there was that terrible dog and the way she talked to it Â I want to shoot it dead), awful!
- Joyce calls back immediately after seeing Derek's number on caller ID when Stacy and Barb accidentally call her with the computer, then proceeds to leave a message that makes it sound like she calls all the time.
I would not recommend spending money to rent it, if it comes on a movie channel, then maybe give it the time, who knows, some might like it.
But this fake interview is so that Murphy's character can actually gain info about her boyfriend's exes so that she can find more out about him while also doing the background for a potential show about little black books, but then it turns out later she isn't going to do the story about the black books, but then we aren't really sure.
The poor coworker's story seems to serve no other purpose than to use screen time, since the subplot involving him comes from nowhere and then goes nowhere.
The difference between the two is so great it calls up the comparison Mark Twain made between the right word and the almost right word: If High Fidelity is lightning, then Little Black Book is the lightning bug.
Plot twists are ridiculously contrived, as when the son disappears in the middle of a pitch-black night for no reason, and the daughter then does likewise, simply to allow an untended fire to get out of control.
If you want to believe that you are a superior form of humanity, watch this film and then tell everyone you know that they must see it, that it will move them deeply, and that they will never be the same thereafter.
The characters can all be detestable, for instance, but then something else has to "step up."
The camera pans away for a few seconds then goes back and the killer is gone.
The camera literally pans away for about 2 seconds and then goes back!
not a slow fade in with credits, nothing to prepare you, the obviously photo-shopped title and then RUNNING footage pasted on the screen.

on the way, lover boy has to pee and then starts to make out with his girlfriend and they run out of gas.
the cops then come and save the girls as the movie ends.
3: After one of the female character's boyfriend dies she runs 10 feet away and sits down crying, cut back to here 10 minutes later still seating then decides to make a move.
But then, the rest of the movie is the two girls running from the killer wildly, but then entering rooms and leaving their backs to doors and spots where the killer was.
To me there's a throughline of complexity that runs from TOS to DS9 and then just stops at Voyager.
The first season wasn't bad, though it did rely on time travel too much, but then the writers got lazy.
they state they cannot loose shuttle, then blow up several with "no way of replacing them".... then replace them by building a shuttle.
After that, he goes around and makes terrible jokes then sniffs other dogs butts.
Now if none of this makes any sense to you then you might as well stop reading and forget about the film.
If you are completely NUTS about PokÃ©mon then this is SO for you!
I mean first they acknowledge that fighting is bad, and then they go back to fighting because they have no problem with exploiting these poor creatures.

The cult then is after the niece, trying to kill her and resurrect her into their cult.
And then there are numerous inconsistencies and illogical goings-on that kept amazing me.
And then there's suddenly a back-door in the labyrinth, and it appears to be exactly at the spot where the creature has it's sleeping-den, just a wooden door with one wooden bolt!
If you want to be creative, then write something new, you don't go around messing with classic Greek stories.
If you enjoy watching American soldiers die then you may like this movie...
And then I turned off the DVD-player and went on to do something else.
This film was based on true events and if the US soldiers were as badly trained and stupid as this outfit are portrayed, then it's a wonder they didn't lose the war sooner.
He screws the girl, then steals the guy's money and leaves.
But then, I had a revelation.
See Full Impact, then you'll see the complete film that actually makes sense!
If you really liked Kein Ohr Hasen (a better film, watch it first if you can), then you might like this, but otherwise stay away.
PBS sometimes runs the original on weekends, so maybe you can catch it then.
It's fair to say that this is an improvement from Uwe Boll's previous movies, but then again that's not saying much at all really.
The movie starts by introducing us to a series of characters - the US soldiers - and we are given some interesting background to these men's personal histories, but then this comes to a rather sudden dead end as soon as the fighting begins - at which point the development of these characters completely stops.
In the end it never actually informs the viewer about the history or complicated issues of the Vietnam war, and it doesn't work as an anti-war film either - if Uwe was really trying to promote an anti-war message then it gets lost in a never ending haze of graphic violence.
If you want to watch a movie that gives a more balanced portrayal of both sides, along with some important insights into the Vietnam conflict, and at the same time portrays the true horror of the Vietnam war without dishonoring the men who were forced to fight in it, then give Tunnel Rats a miss and watch We Were Soldiers instead.
Under the control of Dr. Morris, Ted then participates in gathering the human hearts he must have for injections that allow him to return, temporarily, to normal.
The retard should have been treated when he first struck but then the movie would have ended half an hour after it started.
If it would have gone for a magic realism approach from a director like Julio Madem or Kim Ki Duk, or a surreal approach from someone like David Lynch, then maybe, just maybe it could have got away with the unacceptable events taking place in this film.
), performing some serious kind of operation there(there would be some serious scarring and everything), and then just putting her back to bed and leaving?

(2) After my cousin's successful implant, I then told one of my best friends about the implant surgery.
We were about to turn the channel but then the amazing acting and dialog caught our attention.
Now if there's one country in the world that seems to always be the fastest to leap onto any given cinematic band wagon, then it surely must be Italy.
Still, if you're a fellow fan of the Sword & Sorcery genre, then you'll no doubt want to see this and make up your own mind.
Thinking quickly, he runs up the stairs and then CLOSES HIS FOREARM IN THE DOOR.
People say things, go places, and are then killed.
The sub-professional screenwriter .....of this movie....., Arriaga, then reaches for the blow torch again when the Barry Pepper character 'escapes' from captivity and enters a cave to hide only to be bitten by a rattlesnake!
.....how this beaten-up man, dispirited, exhausted, malnourished, riding without a hat in the daytime Mexican sun then slung over a horse and riding for unknown hours, over rough terrain, could survive a rattlesnake bite is another story whopper too......
How then to deal with the duplicity of Melquiades in telling Pete about his non-existent family in Jimenez?
The story lurches across a field of gaping holes in the plot, and requires a chain of unbelievable circumstances, then simply disappears into complete irrationality.
If you fancy being preached to by being beaten over the head by a moral maniac, then you might enjoy this over-rated nonsense.
If it were artistic, or intelligent, then I could forgive this movie it's sins.
Rocket Power is basically a show about four typical preteens.They are the sports fanatics who love to be better then the others.We got Otto,an airhead who wants to go big.Reggie,who is the smart reporter,but also the surfer girl.Twister is the silly,random jackass of the group and Sam is the super smart kid,who has more book smarts then street smarts.As if I haven't seen this before!
Now,I lived in a "ghetto" town in Pennslyvania,so I don't know what life is like in New Jersey or California.but looking,it makes me not want to go.To me,its only showing that people on the coast states are stereotypical idiots who care more about sports and kicking ass,then anything else.I know,it deals with lots of issues,like breaking the rules,being carefree and being kids,but for God's sake,what the hell!?
For example, I have a theory that he saw a good use of a fade out in a movie once and thought that if one fade out is good, then 75 of them must be great!
The camera shows Sarah talking and then slowly fades out to black only to shift to Laura in bed as she responded directly to her mother and continues the conversation.
When Paul asks if Laura would pose for his new sculpture Sarah refuses so why does she then say that she will take photos of a naked Laura for Paul to use?
Bilitis, Summer in St Tropez, then this is best forgotten.
If it's not so, then it's Cassavetes who should have been fired.
If the producers had wanted to make a sequel to the hilarious Falk/Arkin "The In-Laws," then that's what they should have done.
Start a service business in any small town America and then bash half of the towns populous.
If you believe in Vietnam movies should show Americans winning every battle then this movie is definitely not for you.
I really laughed out loud then.
I actually sat through the "making of" section of this DVD, and upon finding out that it was made with no budget and mostly straight actors then it all made sense.
If very attractive gay men can't seem to get it together in the real world, then I guess the average Joe such as myself doesn't have a snowball's chance in Hell either!
The film follows them as they interact with the men already there and it then follows them as they go out on a mission, which unfortunately coincides with an enemy attack.
Lets start with the fact that one of the characters is sold to a white slavery by a co-worker for doing her job ring and instead of her being distraught she brags about being approached for a book deal and how she gave her phone number to one of the police who rescued her...  Also, two of the random prop characters (Two stereotypical "hood" women) tells one of the main characters that she loved the Dalai Lama in the TV show Falcon Crest... her friend then says "Girl, you so stoopid, that was Lorenzo Lama.
How on earth could anyone watch this film and then think it was anything but a steaming pile of low budget crap.
It looks like someone filmed it with a mobile phone and every now and then you see shadows of the crew.
Well actually I love watching horrible movies because then at least i can laugh and wonder why anyone would ever make this.
After entering the church, Kerr stops at the alter, looks up, drops his jaw in wonderment then says, "That's my Brother".....looking up Jesus on the cross!
Please watch and then rate.
A way to fix this is to have Wil looking at the Orb, get up to leave the room (to establish that he's going to go look at the Orb) and then cut to the scene of the orb, then cut to him looking at it.
And then there is the story.
They then try to find the club she works at, "Cryptz," by calling a spooky friend of theirs named Truck who they think know all about underground clubs and things like that.
I guess they felt obligated to shoot all the dialog that was scripted, and then were happy with it, but it could have been cut down.
If real ballplayers are like these guys, then there are no heroes in baseball.
If it does not, then the new member is welcomed.
that was totally expected...anyway, the movie then skips to 7 years later.

Not the greatest movie, but if you like "B" movies, then this one is surprisingly entertaining.
There is some character development, and the film comes to ludicrous, multiple-twist finale, but by then it's too late.
As for the plot, it's all quite dreary Â and lazy: all the Earth monsters have conveniently been assembled on an island to be studied (yeah, right Â just try to get a blood sample from Godzilla, or Rodan, for that matter)...but, then, the aliens (naturally possessing superior intelligence and frightening assurance Â they must have missed MONSTER ZERO, for they're deluded into thinking that the monster ensemble can't hold a candle to King Ghidorah!)
Well, I finally got ahold of it (of course, by then it had been 14 years, and I was 18).
They show what the laser is cutting, they show the device, then they show the guy cutting and this goes on for a good bit.
This results in an attack from the monsters on all major cities in the world... but Godzilla knows who his real friends are...  Silly story, silly effects and an ending which power rangers would be ashamed of... but then again, laughable at times (is that a good sign?).
However if you want a pi$$ take out of a film, and have a few laughs along the way, then watch it purely for this purpose alone!
If sickening Hollywood endings make you want to spew then this is for you.
(Not loosing any time with the cheese here)  2 - Our hero then gets ganged by the local ruffians who decide to use him as a decoy for a robbery.
*Rocky - Eye of the Tiger soundtrack*  8 - Our newly leveled up hero then storms the to the final castle.
As many other stories of science fiction this saga begins with one prophecy of one warrior who will kill the ultimate evil who destroys his world, then all the classic elements are changed just to put a bunch of laments characters commanding a big space ship of an ancient insect race who manifest in the end of the fourth movie with the form of a human(at least the face).
If you don't see every single angle coming, then you might as well stop seeing films.
To me it seems as if this film is being instructed by two VERY different directors, because the depiction of Alabama population in the last 2/3 of the movie reminds me most of all of cartoon characters rather then actual homo sapiens.
If you find some things to be so stupid that they're hilarious, then this movie is for you.

Considering the fact that this is kinda a big home movie more then a movie, Skeeter will give this one a 4 for 10.
If you can stomach over 90 minutes of fart jokes and moronic sound effects, then by all means throw your money away on this cinematic abomination.
The whole "queen of the gorillas" thing is introduced early in the film, and then just dropped until about seven minutes from the end, as our protagonists head off to Africa to capture some giraffes and rhinos (Howard Hawks so ripped this off for HATARI!)

We then discover that in her past life, she had been a gorilla!
Dan then decides to take Laura with him to 'Africa' on safari for new animals.
Now and then a bad movie becomes unintentionally hilarious, but most of the time bad movies are simply bad.
And then there's the acting.
They meet during a baseball game and then again at a bar.
"...The scene with Elizabeth Perkins reading to the children in her kindergarten class and then discussing sex briefly...That scene is just plain awful.
They are all dull, have little personality & there is a brief sub plot about Gloria having an affair which last for about 5 minutes & then completely forgotten about.
I know, it's lame but I had never seen the film before today and then it all came back to me when I saw the scene.
I say 'no', but then again.. who am I?
Recently, his mother got a boyfriend whom she lets move in with them, and from then on, the plot goes downhill and gets lost in a plethora of senseless foul language, shameless and gratuitous sex, and drugs.
which reminds me, the worst scene was when Jody hits his girlfriend, and then goes down on her.
IF the scenes in jail/prison were actually shot there with real inmates, then they can be excused.
The arrival of William Holden at the end, in a half-decent climactic shootout, is the only moment that the film comes to life, but by then most discerning viewers will have bolted for the exits (if in a cinema) or pressed the stop button (if watching a video or DVD).
It very much seemed like they just decided to do a bunch of cool CG then decided to fit in some sort of storyline as an afterthought.
If this really is the Last Horror Movie then it's a shame that the genre had end on such a weak note.
If the "Snookums and Meat Funny Cartoon Show" couldn't do it for you; if the ZOOG things that stole the Disney Channel couldn't do it for you; heck, if you are *looking forward* to "Back to Neverland"; then this will break you into a weeping blob of protoplasm faster than you can blink.
Pam was crazy about Greg when he was a Van Halen look-alike but when he cut his hair and started to dress corporate (to work for an insurance company)did her feelings for him start to change then?

While going through all of the emotional stress stemming from her Peterson affair, she then becomes pregnant from a male friend who is supposedly there for support.
Amber then rejects the possibility of an abortion, portraying herself as a caring, nurturing person, but is now ready to deliver a second illegitimate child (after the first, whose father was improperly identified for years).
What a surprise then, when I searched her on Google after watching the movie, to discover that she had written the required book, appeared on numerous chat shows, sold the film rights, etc.
If it's not - then, please excuse me, but this was a performance that ran the gamut of emotions from A to B.
If this is one of the best movies you guys ever saw, then please go watch some real movies.
Yashraj films are normally considered the best production house even though they have done worst copies(compared to Bhatt who give at least better films though copies) And have made trash films  The film is a lame copy of NINE MONTHS  The comedy scenes are puerile except Jaaved's scenes rest are nothing great, the shouting scenes are lame  The twist is well handled but then nothing much happens and the film ends in a very bad manner  Siddharth Anand handles only few scenes well, many scenes are over the top Music is good  Saif repeats his DCH act and acts well though he often cribs and gets boring Preity is good in serious scenes but overdoes many parts Jaaved is funny Abhishek hams Jugal is okay
Without giving too much away for those that want to waste time watching this, there are situations that develop that feel as though there were lifted right out of a Three's Company episode with Jack Tripper being put in compromising situations that are then misunderstood.
The basement rapidly turns into a rendezvous place for horny losers, but then the fun is over when the girl bites back.
But then that is just about all it is is a story loosely based on real facts, as I perceive them.
"He looked up at me and said, I'll be alright Dad... and then he died."
Sad, because it starts out with a bang when the prison fakes Liotta's execution and he is then transported to Dafoe's lab to begin his transformation.
If you've seen her appearance at the Acadmey Awards for 2004, then you'll see she has achieved her goal, no matter how.
Sung Hi Lee is an anomalous character who's found with the bad guys early in the film, but then plunges in to cooperate whole-heartedly to help the good guys.
If you like cheesy, low-budget haunted house films (which I normally do), then you might wanna give this a look.
Go back to the beginning and the Lutzes.could we have imagined back then what their hoax was going to do to the world .even to this day people keep trying to go to the house which has been remodeled and the address changed,hollywood still keeps churning out these stupid fictitous movies regarding the orginal hoax ..the owners who moved in after the lutzes never had any incidents and even sued hollywood and the lutzes for fabricating the whole thing.
(sounds like Exorcist III).He then hangs himself the next day in guilt.The mysterious characters continue with a lady with a glass eye (Mrs.Morioriti)who tells the story about the priest.
If not, then avoid this one.
Why did they call it this then.
Nothing much has impressed me more since then.
Mr.Pegg and Mr. Moran musta had some bills to pay.This is the worst kind of predictable"feel good" tripe imaginable.Immature boy gets girl,immature boy loses girl to rich successful mature boy and then proceeds to mature to win back girl.Also this film tries to have it both ways,there are plenty anti-American digs lobbed about whilst the film repeatedly has tons of product placement shots for Nike.Gotta laugh at that.Not a complete waste but most of the gags are flat and "been there before" kinda stuff.Shame Mr. Pegg seems to be rotating to this kinda tripe,it would make a "nice" double bill with the almost equally as awful "Hot Fuzz"
There's nothing objectionable about it, but then again there's nothing memorable either.
But if you're after something similar to Peggs previous work, that's inventive or off the wall, then this film isn't it.
The film's composition and tone are spare; I was reminded of a Belle and Sebastian cd cover, and then lo and behold, the band was thanked in the end credits.
My advice if they are interested: get audience feedback once you've got a starting cut of a film, then go to work and make it better before you send it out for the world to condemn it.
And then, after they take a bike ride, go BACK to his house he had just been kicked out of, and return to the bedroom with Eban?
Seriouly, I'm not a high-brow movie viewer...I like a fun, dumb movie every now and then.
H2O portrays Canadians as a bunch of supine, weak-willed, uncaring fools ruled by a secret clique manipulating a naive political class, but then again, lefties portray all nationalities that way.
The assassin traps her, spills clues about the conspiracy, and then lets her go.
he said it was meaningless and useless, but if you read it, after you were done, it would take you to a new level, like a ladder, and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding.
then all the scenes in the total pitch black, where honestly since the characters are so flat, you don't really care whats going to happen, but regardless, after it happens and someone is killed, you just say to yourself, was i supposed to see that?
A lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in Leon, then other parts felt like some other movie, I don't know which, but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie.
If you have not seen Leon, then this is a good movie.
If you liked this movie, then I can recommend Leon.
If by some chance he gets a not guilty verdict then kill him .
This film didn't seem to know what it wanted to be, if you are going to concentrate on the dramatic aspects from the aftermath of an assignation then you need a strong rigid plot with plausible scenery and setting, this is something the viewer has time to take in and appreciate and if you do it wrong then you notice it.
If you want an all out action film (which this is not) then continuity and scenery can be put to the side.
Greengass' sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the Bourne trilogy films.
All goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, the blame falls at Dial's feet.
So even if I personally am sensitized to it, I didn't pick up on the theme until the very ending, and even then, it was incredibly under whelming.
And then they did.
And then more skydiving.
Apparently, someone filmed a bunch of skydiving footage with IMAX and then had to create a movie out of it.
The film then descends into some stupid stuff about Leonardoâsâ original drawing of a parachute â will it work?
Every now and then a show comes along that redefines your relationship with the whole genre.
A peach then begins to grow on the tree.
At least it's better then it's astonishingly bad predecessor.
then gets confused until reminded by Emma.
Then hero Ving Rhames catches one of the men who raped his sister and beats him up then the police sirens are in the background suggesting they are coming.
It's as if screenwriter Andrew Kotting has adapted the 19th century novel word for word in some scenes and then forgotten this when he's written his own scenes .
These trinkets also make Noah, a dim bulb at school, turn into a nationwide science fair champion (since he can communicate with spiders and make then spin webs of his choosing).
Throughout the months that followed, Hess would see Conway Twitty, Andy Williams, Sal Mineo and Pat Boone take his tracks to the top end of the charts and then he settled for a career behind the scenes as head A & R man for Mercury Records.
There's a suspiciously plum accented English girl named Trisha (Angela Bath), and then we have the traditional bed-hopper and inadvertently billed comic relief character, Leia (Judith Bridges).
He then buries their bodies in the backyard with the professionalism and speed of a gang of landscape gardeners.
Peter's attempt's at fooling his guests into thinking the Castle is haunted fail miserably, however all is not lost as then the real ghosts take over.
So, if you don't like the nerves' war with the bad meaning, then don't watch that movie.
remake.....It tries to be serious then it gets to be surreal.
Imagine yourself watching a film with only dialogue, and then at the same time listening to music from a totally different context.
Well, this is not much more then a big disappointment.
The story writer choose to bring the story to a fast end by descending there good personalities into a level lower then ever.
In fact, anyone who dared to give this movie a ten should watch it again and then spend a week in the incest recovery unit of their local hospital.
In "Babe 2," the formerly dignified Farmer Hoggett is only in it for about 10 minutes, but in that short time, he's flung down a well, and then makes goofy gestures.
Mrs. Hoggett is strip-searched by drug agents, is doused with a bucket of glue, and then is flung around a ballroom on a bungee, dressed in the dead clown's costume, no less.
My favorite part is seeing all the animals get caught and then escape to the farm.
If you don't understand its "R" rating, just watch (or rather listen) to the scene at the beginning, and then you'll understand why.
Maybe if WB went back and retook a new ending and then re-released this, they would have better luck.
'Demon of Paradise' isn't the complete pits, but for most part is quite an flatfooted cheapjack co-American/Philippines monster feature, which treads water for too long and then amusingly erupts in the unimaginative final quarter.
But wherever it is about, for some reason there's dynamite and then explosions seem to follow.
But then, Hollywood doesn't live in the real world, has serious trouble with right and wrong, and cares not a whit about our children.
The hunt starts, and then all of a sudden it's nighttime.
The almost entirely submerged aircraft then manages to explode.
When the kids finally do realize that Lizzie is still in the asylum, they have moments of panic, then they revert back to their druggy horseplay, then another panic, then horseplay, then panic again.
I recommend watching it, as I did with loose change, and then seeing screw911mysteries as a companion piece.
First of all, I have seen only some parts of the last episode and also some small parts of other episodes (more then it deserves).
If that basic story outline makes you laugh then you may enjoy Vampires Anonymous but I thought it was an awful attempt at trying to be clever & funny & different, Vampires Anonymous is one of the most unfunny comedies I've ever seen & the makers can't even pull off a good sheep shagging farmer joke.
I get involved in a good project now and then to keep things going.
And then I make things that I work on that I hope are going to be good so I can make a living and keep a roof over the heads of those little monsters I have in my house.
The company that produced this must have had the idea that they were making a real movie so they used the tease of Mary Carey and the other women to draw viewers who would then be amazed at the quality of the film just watched.
He then gets in the patty wagon with arguably the best character of the movie, an unknown convict named Jimmy Huang or some sort of phallic name like that.
Mr. Joshua then meets with his la la la lawyer who is obviously smoking some of the drugs that our "star" was caught with.
Raymond then meets a disgusting woman teaching poetry (go figure) to the troubled murderers and rapists with artsy souls dying to get out.
Do yourself a favor and watch Breakin 2: Electric Boogaloo, the Mountain Men, and Slam, and then try not to kill yourself, I dare you.
The basic plot is a character named Raymond Joshua, a rapping drug dealer played by Saul Williams, gets arrested for drug possession, then bailed out by a fellow prisoner - SERIOUSLY - then must decide whether to go back to prison.
He then meets a female poetry teacher who happens to see the riot stopping poem, a foolish plot device an indie film fan would never forgive in another situation, but hey THIS IS REAL.
A very interesting and entertaining character named Hopha, a prisoner who goes around in a lab coat for some reason, then bails Joshua out.
Joshua then goes and hooks up with the poetry instructor, and has a week to decide whether accept his guilt, or flee or something.
Once again the bad editing is at work here as he rattles off 20 seconds of poem, then starts over, I'm fairly sure it wasn't meant to be that way they just didn't feel like doing another take.
For outdoor scenes on the vampire planet where they land, magenta-colored filters were used--though later they abruptly became green filters, red and then yellow filters!
After seeing John Carradine's excellent performance in 'The Grapes of Wrath' and then in this dreck (and apparently many other titles in the genre), it makes one think that someone was really hard up for a paycheck.
But then, judging from past endeavours, it is impossible to embarrass either Carradine or director Al Adamson.
Amy succumbs so easily to the coach's advances that her character should have been made to be six years old instead of thirteen, and even then, a 6 yr old would've run like crazy.
I admit I'll watch one now and then just to see how far the story will wander off into the surreal.
They do take on serious subjects, but always bail out when it comes to quality acting and directing, and then go for the "Men are Evil" conclusion.
The parents here, along with their victimized daughter, all moved more slowly than postal workers on Valium for the first 1 hour and 50 minutes -- then screamed like Banshees on "Speed" for the final 10.
If you like fantastical Broadway-type entertainment with no value placed on story, then you will probably like this movie.
All we're given is him looking at that spider, doing something on a computer and then BANG -- he's got a science project about bridges across the universe.
Boys tend to jump over each other, verbally, when they're talking; they don't talk, wait for you to talk, then talk.
You get to like the characters through their actions, but even then I was not impressed with it.
It is then revealed that the older girl saved the younger girl from some soldiers.
Therefore, I gave it a 3 but if you are desperate in looking at this film then either borrow it for free!!!
OK, interesting start, then we follow a group of people, lead by a smart professor.
But then they enter the hospital and start murdering...they don't just kill one anymore apparently.
There is no atmosphere, the acting is worse then terrible, there is no  pace,and very little in the way of action.And the least scary 'bad guys' you are ever likely to see.
A plot, which could have had a lot of potential, which was full of promise in the blurb,was truly worse then terrible.
There are shots of the bad guys walking across the parking lot and then they appear in the hospital hallway.
Instead of this movie, you could just watch Mad Max and Doomsday while completely hammered, then take the resulting mess of memories and remove anything entertaining or intriguing, it will be the same experience but far more fun.
i would rather rub one out in front of my parents then watch this again!!
The one guy who is smart enough to leave/escape, stupidly returns to rescue a girl who then doesn't want to leave until she can save the rest; the guy stupidly follows and gets killed while saving her sorry back yet again.
For the final battle scene, the girl whose back was saved way too many times stops to put on war paint like in the movie 'Braveheart', and then single-handedly goes off to kill the cannibals as they are cooking her friends body parts over an open fire.
you can past that the general conceit of the whole film, America turning into a barren wasteland simply because they used up all the oil, is a straw dog impossibility and if you push aside that character's this stupid and ineffective could survive when nearly 2/3rd of the population have passed on, then this certainly had the capacity to be a fun little flick.
If you answered 'a', then you fully deserve the 'Max Rockatansky Award for Successful Post-Apocalyptic Survival; if your answer was 'b', then pray that civilisation never crumbles: you're clearly not built for life in a world thrown into utter chaos.
OR b) devise an elaborate plan to get one of your people to infiltrate the group, then wait until nightfall, when the building is plunged into total darkness, and take just one victim, leaving the rest for another night-time visit at a later date?
If you answered 'a', then congratulationsÂyou have the makings of a successful (and well-fed) cannibal; if you answered 'b' then you're as stupid as the bad-guys in Tooth and Nail, and fully deserve to have your own ass handed to you on a plate.
I almost walked out, and then like twenty minutes in, one of these guys gets his throat cut.
I also felt that it was all too predictable that Victoria would be rescued when she was captured, and then she would be the only one with the brains to overcome the obviously stupid cannibals, which she is able to do through the simple trick of not showing her drugging bodies.
Oh, and then there's Sharon Stone,Âno surprises here.
Just then some music comes up.
In my case watching a glacier is more interesting then this film.
Had Megghy been an adult, then perhaps you might have felt uncomfortable about her dippy behavior but you'd agree that as an adult she's free to mess up her own life.
If you guys have seen derailed then in initial part of the movie only you will realize that its another copy of movie.
The film was supposed to be a thriller but wasn't even a jot thrilling, then what is left?
Well, how else to characterize a movie the plot of which is as follows: semi-degenerate-looking man goes crazy, then tries to seduce a cheaply country-erotic woman; fully degenerate husband of country-erotic woman cuts off finger of girl bitten by dog; neighbors take girl away; woman runs off with man, has wild sex in fresh air; husband burns empty house down to the ground, takes shotgun, shoots cow, shoots man and woman.
There's nothing as pathetic as wanting to make a horror movie about a dangerous killer dog and then cowardly blame his action and behavior on the black magic powers of his owner.
Well, you can't openly declare that you like (or even enjoy) watching this type of movies because then Â let's face it Â you automatically get a stamp on your head that says 'potential threat to society'.
Like 4 or 5 out of 10Âbut then it got entirely spoiled by the abrupt and idiotic ending.
quite frankly, if u want to show women's bodies and make money, then do just that n do it in a way which makes the experience worth enjoying.. or if u want to show the prison life, show it with some empathy and sincerity.
Other then super fake electrical shocks there is none of that.
If that's what I was looking for then I suppose I would have to have rated this movie more then a 4/10 but it was a little to soft-core for me.
His constant mugging and upstaging of his costars is more appropriate to Mack Sennett then M.G.M.
If you want to reminisce about television shows from your childhood and have a warm loving tone when you do so, then you can definitely find better ones than this load of rubbish.
I can say however, that Edinburgh looks fabulous, but then it always does.
And then the sex scenes.
Suffice it to say that if this is the way that the UK Film Council is spending it's money then it's no wonder British film industry is in such dire straits.
Take it from me just don't bother, I began watching it, thought, yeah not so good but maybe it will pick up, no, an hour in, nothing happens, still no sign of any plot, comedy, I then did something more interesting like watch someone else watch paint dry.
It brings its own array of bizarre characters and situations, mixing them with the locals, and then takes them away again just as quickly, until next year when some of them come back for more.
But put it this way: If it's on TV and not costing you anything, then by all means watch it.
Not only is he then allowed to leave the office without being stopped by the security guard/police, but they never seem to look for him either.
He then contacts Gipson again, informs him what he has done, and tells him that he will restore Gipson's credit rating in exchange for the missing document.
Since then it's been sadly one good episode every two seasons.
Must have been the writers and directors fault then.
But then the realisation hit me that there is a major difference between ZAZ films and "Der Wixxer": In a ZAZ film much of the slapstick will happen in the background, something which does not necessarily have to be noticed the first time you watch the film but which is funny nevertheless.
So once again if you want to laugh at the bad acting, weak plot, horrible makeup, and cheesy effects then by all means watch this movie.
It definitely has a "new age" touch, it's mysterious, and with a nice bit of surreal/sci-fi - if you liked movies the same pace and style as K-Pax (though this one is a bit more geared towards kids), then you'll probably like Mimzy.
But, if you've been hankering for some drive-in quality, B-movie slasher junk -- then why the hell not?
Sorry about writing in CAPS earlier, I just thought it might be funny if the director saw that and got excited, then was let down when he read the rest.
The movie then proceeds to show us a goth guy in a suit screeching in an old microphone lyrics that apparently should tune us in the movie, because they are relevant to the heroine's situation.
I am sick of all relatives to the group that made this film, who comes here and votes 10 stars and say its a great masterpiece better then Twin Peaks with breaking music.
If you can find this movie for sale for 1 cent, then maybe, just maybe i would recommend it for you if you are in need of a DVD-cover.
I rate this a two, because I know some of the actors' are better then the material, and there are a couple decent kill scenes in the end, though nothing special.
And then there's the Doc; Brad Dourif in a long overdue role.
I might say for Exorcist devotees only, but then anybody who truly appreciates the original will want to steer clear of this sequel.
Perhaps then they might understand that their declining sales have nothing to do with piracy, MP3 trading, or even bootlegging.
Surely if the Pixies were indeed 'one of the most influential bands of all-time,' then these secondary sources would be overflowing with information that the filmmaker could have used to place in the Pixies in the context of modern music for viewers who aren't already familiar.
It came off, to me anyway, as a tad dated and more then a tad more cartoonish.
Actually if you want to see the best part of the film, watch the accident that opens the film then turn it off because it never gets better than that.
If you would like to see some very unappealing gratuitous nudity, and you have a brain the size of a pea, then you might like this movie.
If Gregor Jordan's career ends up warranting serious critical reappraisals in the future, then this is going to be the gleaming, once-misinterpreted jewel in some chancer's festival retrospective.
Well, the title and "Genere" made me interested about it, so I watched...well, if you guys want to waste your 12$ money and 120mints from your life then please watch it!
The final scene (not the conclusion, but the very final scene itself) is disturbing, sad and yes, memorable; but by then you feel like you wasted too much time with something that's been done several times, and much better, before.
But then a lot of people thought shoulder pads were a good idea.
He said yes, then a moment later (after another reaction) quietly got up and moved to the back of the theater.
Foster and Raido seemed like actors "acting" like the types rather then being the types.
Since then, Keira Knightley has proved that my initial impression might was far too hasty.
Well, when most of actors are from the family, the best actors from this movie are then the American secondary actors.
If you wanted to watch something that scars you for a while, then in that case I deeply suggest you stay out of watching this movie!Evren Buyruk
But then the writers decided to switch gears and bring back Kira and the rest of the old cast from Gundam SEED, and they ultimately save the day.
The new characters are soooo annoying, if u ppl thought Yzak was bad, then man he is a cool character, and him and Dearka should have had a bigger role in this season.
OK, i might sound like a complete ass for dissing this so much, but if ur looking for a good plot then don't bother with this season, if u end it at Seed, then it makes hell of a better ending than continuing like this.
From then on I watched the 3rd movie of the original, Double Zeta, Char's Counterattack, Victory, and a few episodes of Turn-A.
If a director, producer, and/or screenwriter rely too much on lazy re-caps, re-usage of images, and "specials" based on re-used and re-edited scenes; then one wonders why people like them have been hired or are still employed.
Rather than casting professional, talented comedians, Irvine cast young men who look like high school students, dressed them up in wigs and costumes, and then made them recite raccoon jokes.
First off, one must sit through Lloyd Kaufman's increasingly annoying rants, and then, the pay off, a really bad movie.
If you really have a desire to watch high school students act like children, then just go to the mall.
The movie doesn't really explore medieval gender roles all that deeply, though - Gwyn dressing as a man is made slightly fun of, but there's no shock nor any disapproval of what might have even be considered sinful back then.
If you have ever read a biography on Chopin, or even just listened to his music, then you know what a highly intelligent, sensitive, perfectionist, almost otherworldly man he was.
She also falls in like with a young man and then creates a scene in a library when he won't just drop everything and have sex with her.
If I can spare at least one fan of Kim Ki-duk's other films from wasting their time on this sub-par offering, then my work here is done.
then she runs out to the plastic surgeon wanting a new face which will take 6 months to heal during which time she abandons the hot sweet as pie boy.
so then this horrible doctor who operated on the original horrible girlfriend decides the thing to do is to have our now thoroughly destroyed leading man who is so adorable and hot and long suffering undergo the knife as well, so they can be even... and .
so then all these not by any means terrible looking but nowhere near as darling as the star of the picture guys make the scene, by this time I'm really quite honestly watching at +1 speed at which I can still read the subtitles.
Yet the narrative is very unevenly paced - initially it deliberately takes very little time to set the basic premise of the story, but then after dragging out the middle section of the story, the final series of events seem to pass at a frankly ludicrous pace.
The character is largely bewildered by events but then as the story unfolds he goes through wider mood swings that are not conveyed in a way that makes the viewer believe or empathise with these emotions.
If you are planning for a Saturday morning movie to watch in bed while eating breakfast, then this is your movie.
There were some really old and amazing ruins from some medieval cities and then the forest and the Black Sea.
If you really want to see this one, please wait for it to be on video, and even then have a back up plan, as I doubt you will want to sit thru the whole thing.
Now this sentiment is all very well & good but it would have helped if there was a decent film behind it & then there's the fact that Contamination .7 is far from the first film to tackle this issue.
So instead of the accepted HappyEnding being what I wanted to see, instead I badly wished that SINCE Gwyn and Prince Charming couldn't marry, then over time, she "settled" for Froderick, who in my opinion was much more steady, sensible, handsome (except for the hairdo), and would make a much better husband.
During the film's one and only bloody scene, the roots go into a guy's mouth and then poke the eyeball out of a mannequin head.
Seriously, unless your tolerance for utterly atrocious physical 'comedy' and dialogue that a dyslexic 6-year old could have spat out is ridiculously high, then you have no reason to watch this horror of a production.
Well then, if our path is so wrong...  Why is it that people in industrialized nations are healthier and living longer than at any other time in history?
Then in 1960 this doubled to 3 billion and then it accelerated to 4 billion in 1976.
Maybe if you are from the planet of Mars and are absolutely new to the topic of Global Warming on planet Earth - then yeah, you can watch this movie.
If a laugh track is the case, then it doesn't work.
The first couple of minutes between Alf and Beverly Archer(Harriette Byrd in past episodes) was funny but then the film isn't about Alf so much as Military abuse of authority and the love story of two young Doctors who befriend Alf while he is in captivity with the Alien Task Force.
If they had cast people who didn't have breast implants then maybe that aspect would have worked.
In the Tudors, there is only 1 sister, Margaret, who marries the King of Portugal and then Charles Brandon.
and gives him a blow job, and then throws a childish tantrum because Cute Neighbor wants to leave the next morning.
"Sun Stroke" would be a better title - if not to describe the disorienting feeling of viewing it, then to describe the leading men - who can't seem to stop doing it to each other.
The first 30 minutes are plausible, if slow and poorly written, but then the story becomes a muddle of flashbacks, flash forwards and God knows what else.
The opening sequence screams that it's going to be a violent - Very violent - urban thriller , there's bits after this that hints it might be a farcical comedy and then the movie settles down into a rom com .
And don't get me started about the pure silliness of the balloon angle), then picks up his daughter, and together they bury the diamonds with a photograph in a field.
Throw in Portia De Rossi as Dreyfuss's daughter (and the 'I hate him for no apparent reason, no wait, now I love him for no apparent reason' relationship with Slater - and I use the term 'relationship' lightly; Tom Cruise had more chemistry with the fish in 'Jerry Maguire'), a painful cameo by RuPaul, a moderately funny though sadly underused Billy Connolly, a mob boss with all the menacing screen presence of American Pie's Chris Klein, two mob button men more cut out for a Home Alone sequel and a soundtrack that sounds like background music from a computer game, then have almost the entire movie played out as a series of flashbacks that Slater is telling mob hitman Critical Jim (played by Tim Allen, who is constantly quoting classic movies a la Remington Steele) and have the audience needlessly wonder at how much of what Slater is saying is true, if anything, and what kind of plot twist might be in store (needlessly wonder because *Spoiler* it's all true and there is no plot twist), and end it all with a cliched train station finish...  Well, what can I say.
The general idea of this film is a good one: In the run-up to the Great Depression and stock market crash, and then in their throes and wake, high-level executives have been cutting corners and cooking the books at a financial firm, first trying to get rich and then trying to hide their titanic losses.
With the perpetrator removed, the journalist then continues his investigation, and basically learns nothing more.
It starts off in a slow time warp and then the cement starts to set.
So he throws a dish on the floor, then hands one to her to do the same.
Not only was the writing poor but the plot has more holes in it then a homeless mans shirt.
Get together with your buddies, have way too much to drink, grab a pen and paper, a video camera and by morning you'll have a film ten times better then this one.
If your into cheesy films this is a good one, but if you are not a fan of dumb things then I suggest not even trying it.
this movie isn't scary or sad funny nothing this is more of a ghost story then a scary movie i wasn't scared but i wont give it a one because i thought it was good to watch there's only one or two good reviews on this i say its OK but   scary film so go rent that or this there are thousands of scary movies though more scary then this like high tension saw and much more and its nothing like the shining this is not a scary movie but if you like old like scary movies that are like this i say you rent it and wacth it and like it but if you like scary movies you can get something eles.rated pg13 for mild language
If not, then this film would be a huge waste of your time and money.
If you have time to waste, and I MEAN WASTE, then by all means this is the movie for you.
But then came the "capture".
At the end he staggers, half-dead, out of the girls' dorm (where he was "kept" for a couple of weeks) and then gets beaten(!!!)
Something would happen in the movie, then all of a sudden it will cut to another scene and never carry on what happened.
Even then, I don't think sitting through it is even worth the laughter.
This is a low budget movie and it has it's flaws but I liked it because of the way it showed how loneliness, alienation and a bad upbringing can turn a man from being a quiet introvert into a peeping tom and then a murderer and then full blown insanity.
And the genius Viktor is so totally stupid that he just can't help pissing off the murderous creature and then putting his loved ones conveniently in its path and running off somewhere so that it can have an easy uninterrupted go of it.
But then again, who cares about that when the movie is a total waste of your almost 2 hours, hours that will NEVER come back.
He then goes off to the Second World War and loses his memory (or has dissociative personality disorder) anyhoo he does not remember his previous life.
it seemed to me like they filmed several separate "incidents" that they found funny, then remembered that films are supposed to have plots, so they threw in one scene introducing his roommate as some guy smoking pot on his couch, and then we were expected to have an emotional reaction later on in the hospital scene when he's there and malkovich is pretending not to recognize him?
If any proof was needed to show that John Malkovich is probably the most over-rated actor of his generation, then this it it.
But, then it goes nowhere, except cliche-land.
As we well know Vietnam was then under that colonial umbrella known as French Indo-China and Saigon was its capital.
Now the movie seemed to imply she was possibly a prostitute or a mistress--but even then, it seemed silly to have her traipsing around in one glamorous gown after another in a third world nation.
If you like cardboard cutouts in the crowd...wrestling moves that are supported by visible wires...and a plot that a monkey could write...then rent this movie...
Just been watching this movie Boogeyman 2 and for me it was not anything I will watch again.Alltough I must say the good looking cast was OK and some of the gore scenes fine.Much more gore than I expected as the first Boogeyman from 2005 is pretty dry.Plot is OK..but nothing more.Starts with two children watching the Boogeyman killing their parents and then go forwards 10 years and they both at a clinic to overcome their fears for the Boogeyman.Some scenes really bloody and not for the sensitive ones.Maybe worth a rental but not a film I will buy to my DVD collection.If you like your film bloody and a movie not any different than many other horror films coming out these days maybe this is a film for you.I give this film 3/10.
If you want a thriller, 'who's doing it' type of film then sure this might be for you, if you want a horror though i would wait and see if Boogeyman 3 has anything decent to offer.. who knows it might actually have the Boogeyman in it this time.
Such great locations of New York with some good actors, and then to be ruined by this ridiculous screenplay.
They have implausible relationships with each other... then have implausible relationships with other people and then they have an implausible ending which I won't spoil, as the film does that without any help from me.
He started out setting the stage for a thoughtful drama/comedy and then littered it with completely fake characters and situations.
The ex-girlfriend who he bumps into a couple of times, who makes a pass at him, and then you never see again.
Plus for some reason there's a scene with Duchovny and Crudup talking where Duchovny ends the scene by suddenly announcing "I have to go" and then leaving.
If you have some spear time then this is one to watch.
The characters are introduced and the story starts to develop but then things just start to fall to pieces right before your very eyes.
I overuse the metaphor in my reviews, but a movie this unoriginal is like a joke you heard in kindergarten and then someone tries to make you laugh at that joke when you're 80-years-old.
It's a rambling old dinosaur of a play/script - it thunders along kicking up dust and then heaves its last breath and lays there wheezing on the ground, leaving this viewer wondering if it ever should have been translated to film.
I know I'll get reamed for this, but it had its time and even then, in my humble opinion, it was over rated.
Julie shot the man like 7 times and he still has enough energy to not die, follow her to her house, crawl under a chair (like he would fit), and then pull her under it!
).Meanwhile,Julie's old boyfriend who now has the promising career of ah,fish gutter or something,has to be eliminated so Willis throws a dummy in front of his car and then doesn't kill him,making room for his son who got the weird pseudonym Will Benson(wouldn't it be safer to give him a name that doesn't contain Will,Ben or son?He should have given him a name that's harder to figure out,like John Killer)and they all head to the Bahamas.So Ben is now paying for their holidays or something?Yeah,that'll teach them.
So the happy bunch returns and then Ben attacks Julie in her apartment.I hate to be a wise-ass,but why didn't he do that all along?Why putting in the whole Bahama-thing,which actually complicated everything?On the other hand,I didn't go to psychopatic weirdo-university.My parents were all like,we think it's too expensive for learning so little.
But then the story gets under way and it's the most predictable thing EVER.
She doesn't do anything of the sort, instead she uses the axe to break into a greenhouse and then...THROWS IT AWAY.
Also: Billy Sabbath isn't "brought back to life", as in awoken from the dead; he was simply drugged and then revived.
THE X- FILES was a good show ( At least to start with ) but HELL SWARM is an incomprehensible mess that starts off like an MTV music video , has scenes which led me to believe it was sending itself up , but then becomes utterly dead pan and starts to rip off other superior sources like UNIVERSAL SOLDIER , SECONDS , a bit of DOCTOR WHO and a lot of THE X- FILES .
Ms. Harrow hires Robertson as her driver then, she steals the virus.
At the end we had to check on the internet the duration of the movie because we were sure a part were missing... but actually not,  ;-) So to summarize, here we go, a sexy girl from a town want to be an actress, and once her boyfriend cheat on her, she and her best friend go to Madrid and spend all their money, buying clothes, making new tits... then she is sad because she can't be an actress so go to her boy friend, and once the figure out that he is still seeing the girl he cheat on her with she go back to Madrid crying, that's more o less the whole movie.
If you haven't seen, Kissing A Fool, then I'd really advise you too.
it feels like the actors were wheeled out on stage, given their lines, filmed, and then wheeled off.
The film starts with promise then descends into a banality that is awesome to behold.
Some where along the away Tealc cops a staff blast then walks a journey over some mountains that would have made Edmund Hillary tired before being healed by an ascended Ancient (what the????).
Vala then releases Daniel etc without resistance (where are the priors - at morning tea?).
And then later we're supposed to think she was duped by Bogart as well.
But then don't create a sitcom and pass it off as a reality show!
She gets a body, doe's an autopsy & then go's on her own personal crusade to find out who killed the person.
It also shows that he can play a different role then the characters he has played in Kevin Smith films.
and then in thirty years film buffs will say "Did you know that the was a really bad live action version?"
And while this cant replace the original classic, I feel that if it does end up being a bit of film buff trivia then future generations will be missing an enjoyable two hours.
Why must the animal control officer slam beer on the job and burp in a child's face, then show tattooed sayings on his fat belly about being lazy??
You want insurgents to surrender- tape their eyes open and force then to watch this over & over.
If you have ever watched a kung-fu movie, then you have some idea of what the dubbing was like.
In ranking this film we should always start off with a 5 - neutral - then give it 2 pts for costume and effects for a 7, remove 1 point for being a remake for 6 pts and 2 more for remaking a classic, 4 pts, finally lose a point for being absolutely horrible for a 3 out of 10.
The first Heat Miser/Snow Miser scene was well done, but then again it's the only thing left over from the original.
If you're a little teen liking seeing horror movies for the first time in your little life then OK, I do get it.
to claim then, that Turn-On was the worst thing i had seen in my life may not have said as much.
the survival of the fittest" , etc... the director forgets that today's youth are BETTER informed then the previous generation and playing with people feelings, in well to know "i am with you" manner.
But then, a lot of things look good on paper.
But then after the rescue occurs, the series proceeds to grind itself stupid.
I lost track of the amount of scenes we have to endure where characters introduce themselves to other characters after a few episodes (in the second episode alone, Chris introduces himself to Sonic, then the next day introduces himself to Tails and Cream, who introduce themselves to Chris, who introduces them to his grandfather), and the lack of action the setting forces upon us (Sonic and company moves into Chris' household, and have to hide from everyone else for a few more episodes, then get the attention of the outside world after that) forces the writers to hammer out awkward "Komedy" (like the excruciating seventh episode, where Cream spends most of the time hiding from the household while a party is being hosted and generally gets into all sorts of wacky hijinks) to try and make the complete lack of action more tolerable, but are really just making the show even less dignified than the fourth Home Alone movie (you know, the made for TV one with French Stewart as Marv).
I gave it forty minutes, and then walked out.
  Very much on the same lines as a Kevin Smith movie, if you enjoyed Mallrats and Chasing Amy then you should find this entertaining enough.
Most of the pot growers start getting sick by the next day, cough up blood and then become raving lunatics who kill random people for their blood.
The acting is terrible, there's an irritating, generic and repetitive piano score, silly dialogue not worth listening to, one out-of-nowhere topless shot of a woman sitting by a bucket of water scrubbing her breasts and lots of scenes of people running through the woods... and out of the woods onto the road... and then back into the woods again...
Now, these are not your usual George Romero zombies, they don't pounce on a victim and rip out entrails and gnaw lustily on shin-bones, they just take a bite, and then let blood run out of their mouths as they wander off to do something else.
decides that since they haven't reported back, then that MUST mean they've been killed by the weed farmers, who are only suspected to be in the general area.
In any case, it's lights out for the weed farmers, who get violently ill and then get the urge to shamble around and start biting people in order to drink...er, EAT their blood.
Well, we know who to blame then.
They start killing their friends that didn't get infected, then move to campers in the woods.
if you loved the "wogs" series of the late 80's then you will probably think this is funny as well.
If the producers were trying to turn away potential immigrants then they have a hit production, this would turn me away if I was foreign born and saw this as what Australian's were like.
This is completely different from the books where Babar, although chosen king, is mature by then; is the one who makes the elephant society "complex" and urban, etc.
If it is based on later books, then I would venture to say that such books, if actually like this cartoon, stray from the original ones and fail in the same regards and for the same reasons.
In sum, if one really wants to watch Babar, then one should watch Babar: King of the Elephants, not this movie.
If one instead wants something more artistic or fitting with "mature" tastes, interests, etc., then one should watch neither.
Towards the middle then to the end just got weirder and weirder.
This has got to be one of the worst films i have ever seen i mean OK the beginning was OK, good babysitter stalking film then seriously!
If continuous drinking, gambling, cursing, or prostitution may offend you, then this show is definitely not for you.
It manages to encapsulate in a short series of badly staged, and nearly-meaningless scenes, almost everything that the '60s were really about, including the obnoxious political leaders then in power, the rampant dissatisfaction of young women with their exclusive, but all-female educational institutions, the commercialization of pop music, and the proclivity of certain Hollywood types to place beautiful young women in static combinations on a set, where they can actively leer at them with their film cameras rolling.
Instead, my worst fears got answered, and then some.
I could not believe my ears; Buffy finally admits that she loves him, and then Spike replies that she does not and is only trying to be nice, giving me the impression that Buffy might be lying.
I never watched it on TV because when the Buffy movie came out, I hated it (of course, a lot has changed since then).
I paid to see this dog in an actual movie theater...I can't imagine how boring my life must have been then to not have any better alternative--say, root canal work on four teeth at once without Novocaine.
If Simone were driven merely by flattery and lust, then the coupling might seem understandable, but the story seems to go out of its way to show that there is a deeper connection between the two, one that drives the poised, thoughtful and otherwise careful Simone to throw caution to the wind and bed down with jail bait when it isn't even clear that she was able to do the same with a woman she knew for years and loved.
And then comes a white man called Ted Danson and upsets their whole world.
This starts with a premise involving Will Smith going along to a sperm bank so I was expecting to see a bad taste comedy similar to THERE`S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY , but then the whole feel of the movie changes and we see a rampaging elephant running around which led me to think we`d be seeing an animal driven slapstick comedy like ED , but then the film turns into a slightly rom com type movie , and just right at the end it almost turns serious and we have an obligitary uplifting ending .
As you can guess MADE IN AMERICA seems to be very confused as what it`s trying to do which is usually the sign of a bad film and if it`s a comedy with no laughs involved then it IS a bad film
Other then that, the movie is pretty lame.
I had the impression Tornatore started the movie without knowing the end and then he just developed it, adding new ideas, but none credible.
So watch this film once, then watch it again to appreciate the effort made by the crew and actors to make this film truly deserving of the title 'beautiful'.
That fidgeting edginess that seems to arrive and then settle in for the evening.
By the time the film is finished one knows no more about these characters and how they feel about anything or what their hopes, dreams and heartbreaks are then when we first meet them.
Take a really bad movie, multiply its awfulness by 100, run it over with a tank, dice it up and then glue it back together you'll get Blood Lake.
But then as the movie drags on you'll find yourself thinking that, yeah, this is pretty bad after all.
Surely he could see and sense the terrible acting taking place as he was directing; then I imagine him just ignoring it and focusing on just finishing the movie.
But then you remember that you don't really care.
I don't think they should list actors in the credits unless they have prominent roles, and if they do, then maybe the word "bit part" should be next to their names.
It then shifts to comedy (rather lame comedy that is) during the middle of the film.
Rene Russo is wasted too although then again I don't think she was put in the film for her acting skills - they just got her because she looked like the character.
To begin I cant really say I am the best person to judge a movie from all directions and then I mean by acting, script, directing and so forth, but I can say when I see a bad movie and this is 1 of them.
But I am sure I would have liked the movie when I was a kid so maybe there is still hope for this movie for some age group but for those that are older then 14 or around that age and know the movie culture at some level will see those many flaws is this flick.
I did not see all the movie but those few minutes of it that I saw was worth nothing more then telling me I should not see it all.
If you watch porn movies for the story -- then this movie is for you.
I started to watch the film, found the first 5 minutes totally incomprehensible then decided to watch the trailer.
Example, Ling Jhon Silver just killed his Captain in the jungle, Long Jhon becomes captain and the crew cheers, they hear a noise overhead and start running, then out of nowhere Long Jhon is on a mountain or something fighting some huge ant or something.
And then the sets were so terrible, the cable of the ship looked like a church.
For little kids its a good movie, but to be trueful just buy pirates of the Caribbeans and then you can watch the movie with them without throwing up.
If they have a muddy face, then they're evil and must be stabbed by the people with tits.
(a la "The Producers" storyline) If that is indeed the intent (and it's probably painfully obvious to those in the know) then I have a suspicion that they may have succeeded.
It actually looks better then the actual movie!
Even worse then the Tom Cruise wannabe costar who was also horribly bad.
Another big hole-- (Here's my big spoiler, partially disguised) Someone in a courtroom scene sets off a smoke bomb, then slips into a bailiff's uniform to shoot someone.
Ah, the music... alternating between something of a 15th century feel and then 20th century romantic fluff.
But then the film wanders off into the weeds of ridiculousness, as we meet present day people who straight-facedly claim to have seen the little people.
But then...?
Most of the crew is dead and then his dead wife appears.
If you're a classic Scifi lover of action, aliens and at least some kind of story - then I would give this one a skip.
We literally spent about 10-15 minutes watching a few of them water ski, then finally they stop, head to the dock and then.... go out water skiing again!!
Basically the scenario is this: Mengele (Peck) clones Hitler about 100 times, then kills all the clones' adoptive fathers because Hitler's father died.
I somehow can envision Olivier and Peck getting together after having seen the script, and then, before the start of shooting, making a wager as to who can come up with the worst accent.
When a young lower class black fellow from the ghetto,who aspires to be a journalist,wants to meet his idol,a black tv newsman while that tv news reporter is at a crime scene,and then when that same older classy black tv reporter,who turns down the young man's offer to see a video of the young man's work,gets killed in an accident while at the crime scene,the young black fellow takes his place reporting from the crime scene and becomes a hit with local viewers and the tv station and its' news producer.Such is the story of Dexter Jackson in the 1991 film Livin'Large,about a young black man who learns that despite the rewards of fame and money to never forget where you come.
There was not a hint of depth to her character, but then there probably shouldn't have been.
But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following, and left an hour's blank film in the camera.
A film utterly devoid of sympathetic emotion, and out of touch with any reality I'm aware of (but then I am not a bored, rich white male).
A couple of whiny boomer guys p*** and moan about how horrible it is to have money and a great family, chuck it all for sex and drugs in some 3rd world hell hole, then wonder why it's not satisfying.
By boat, by train, and then by bus, the boy whose father was killed by Russians, meets his new guardians on an unpaved road; Hjalma(Michael Nyqvist) and Signe(Maria Lundqvist) Jonsson, one of many Swedish couples who provided shelter and sustenance to over seventy-thousand Finnish children affected by the war.
"Aideista Parhain" is unmistakably misogynistic; it gets off on reducing an old woman to tears, then tries to have it both ways by redeeming her.
"Aideista parhain" casts Signe and Kirsti as the mother and the whore, then lacks the conviction to let the sow be a sow.
At first, I thought it was a movie about college, since all the actors were so old and just walked in and out of classrooms at their leisure, but then I was stunned that they were suppose to be high school age.
You never get to care or find out any information but rather just watch Henry have this steamy little fling and then somehow learn from it and graduate.
If it does happen to come your way, as it did mine, on satellite TV late one night, try and stay awake for Kate O'Mara's appearance in a see-through nightie, then switch off.
And Sangster matches him beat for beat; scenes have no pacing, they're just there, fulfilling their plot function (most of the time -- there's no payoff to Victor getting the dean's daughter pregnant), and then going slowly on to the next sequence; each scene is laden with boring talk.
It seems to take almost the entire movie to bring the Monster to life, and then he doesn't do anything very interesting -- plus he's one of the least interesting-LOOKING Frankenstein Monsters in movie history.
I recognised a name or two in the cast, then I saw that it was a Hammer Horror film, so I thought it was worth at least a try.
Wilhelm is perfectly happy to lethally inject, then revive, a tortoiseÂ but Frankenstein seems to have bigger ambitions, including eventually re-animating a dead person.
i would TOTALLY have a stripper as my girlfriend) and then proceeds to get hit by a taxi in slow motion (which was actually mildly amusing).
we then meet doc brown.
she is then transported to a mausoleum where the grim reaper turns out is a mummy (wtf?)
and the sun then makes him explode.
and then the lovers are finally together!
and then she drowns in the tub.
The idea of escaping and cheating death and then try to get the Grim Reaper of your back is really exiting.
But if you think the actors is very important in a movie "like myself" then DO NOT see this movie.
The whole point of a film in my opinion is to entertain, if a film entertains me for it's duration & I have fun then I can forgive almost anything but when it comes to a film such as Grim Reaper which is such a chore to watch I find myself rapidly losing the will to live.
If there is a film god, then everyone on the project will never work again.
Meanwhile her boyfriend is searching for her after she was struck by a car and nobody believes him that she's missing.I agree the plot is predictable and lame.It is a complete rip off of the other film i mentioned.If this was a sequel to it then it would make more sense,but it cannot stand on it's own.I couldn't even stay awake to watch the rest of it as i lost interest thinking i have seen this all before.
It was very intriguing watching a new movie produced by the famous Konchalovsky (Runaway Train, Tango and Cash)  The first 15 minutes are interesting, then trouble begins: ridiculous dialogs, unreal situations etc...
If they were trying to say praying over water makes it holy (sorry, you need a high level priest to bless water to make it holy) then that's just bad research.
these Germans then get infected by some insects and come back to get revenge on the American soldiers.
The last soldier is then running for life with his 8 year old grandson, a cop, and a supernatural cop.
the zombie is then not even after the now senior citizen soldier, instead they want to thank him since he stood up for them.
In the end the cop falls in love with the supernatural women, then u find out, duh duh duh, she's a zombie too, but she takes medication so she's not a full zombie.
and frankly I'm not going to comment on the ending, except to say that if those two actors were asked to "make out" in front of the camera, then I'm fairly certain they both have serious relationship problems in real life.
There's loads more inept scenes like those - but if you like movie turkeys then I guess you'll like this one - 2/10 for the unintentional comedy.
It's a lesson to all con artists out there - one way or another you'll get your comeuppance, if not at the hands of angry 'customers,' then angry giant ants.
Â a wealthy bitch, then, gives the film added camp value.
It isn't art, but then it doesn't strive to be anything other than dopey excitement.
Heck, if I didn't turn it off after my father's warning, then I was going to enjoy being scared by it.
I was 5 then.
Okay, so now you are probably thinking "this sounds horrible--it can't possibly get any stupider"--well, if you ARE thinking that, then are you in for a surprise!!!
Her father sells it when she gets hurt, then she turns around and steals it from the rodeo.
The things that Katie does in the film are unrealistic and downright dangerous, and the father is absolutely right in trying to stop her (though if he had have taught her how to train the horse as he did in the original, things would have turned out differently, but then society these days requires more action).
The answer to this is "not much" and even then I was seriously irritated by this movie.
But then it emerges the old fella's been abducted by a Nazi war criminal and his younger cohort (Bernhardt) and his life rests on him using his expert diamond cutting skills on an artifact stolen from the desert.
Problems with the general plot (of how, dragons that dissappeared because thier food was exhausted, managed to stay alive below London for millions of years - and come awake the instant a human touched them... and then only one male exists on the planet) can be distracting.
It's long, drawn out and slow like a typical CSI-ish drama with just a not-so-subtle hint of religious preaching now and then (discounting testimony's from "God", since we'd expect that, but the "it's only logical to believe in God" speech from the nerd-brother?).
Bruno Bonomo is at a loss, maybe he wants to assert himself and then the Berlusconi biopic project lands in his life where it doesn't belong but it is very difficult to understand why he would be interested at first since he doesn't realize what the project is about.
OK, maybe we can buy that, but then, there's a bomb threat a the university he teaches, no big deal, everyone can just leave the campus.
And then there is local lawman Seth Bullock ( Timothy Olyphant ) being as idealistic as bendable towards the law.
At one point Al pays a cabbie $100 so he can drive his taxi, then takes the opportunity to drive around explaining the plot instead of racing to the next location.
That is certainly more then one can remark regarding his quaff of hair which looks like a Muppet left in the microwave too long.
This time being enticed by getting nice things thru gambling initially, then pushed into being an escort to pay back her debts to the gambling club.
The bad guys threaten her by saying that they'll get her husband involved and then she's stuck to being their slave until the money is paid back.
It seems that a local gambling den is actually a front where nice young ladies are hooked on gambling and then forced to become hookers to pay off their debt.
Not only does she seem to live in a void of meaning, but the entire movie and the way the effects are used seem to emphasize emotions to things that have no meaning whatsoever, as if the people behind the plot of the movie have no substance, and no understanding of any better ways to bring some color in to life then buying new curtains and such.
To be fare, if buying stuff is the best thing you can imagine, if it is all you live for, then this movie probably isn't all bad for you.
I haven't seen any of her previous or later attempts, but if this is best she can do, then she is in the wrong field of profession.
Think of everything that could be wrong with a film, triple these things, cover them with a coat of raw sewage then set them on fire and you will have a piece of charbroiled pigslop called "Satisfaction".
She comes off as street savvy, but then melts into Liam Neeson's arms.
Instead we get the great Jody driving through the opening credits, then he stops for gas, then he pulls into a driveway where he sits down for lunch (oh god the horror).
She then gets the nob to stay awhile.
Oh, and then there's lovable Lucinda, who's into doll collecting and dispatching farmers and police officers with pitch forks and meat hooks.
But most of the movie consists of scenes in which one person talks and then the other person takes WAY too long to answer.
He then stumbles upon Melissa who lives on the walnut farm (yep, you read that right) he stopped at.
Only Hollywood would make a movie about a middle aged foul mouth priest and then cast a lesbian as his flame.
But then in the last 2 minutes of the film the priest says that they've had two miracles and they're waiting for another one to happen.
who they then show chained up and hanging around the scrap metal facility - a short segment of the movie which makes an effort to have fathers look bad I guess.
If you like dragons, darker themes and that isolation feel (like in Waterworld) and you like to think to yourself "that is the most fuel efficient helicopter" (you'll know what I mean when you see it) go then, see it.
This worked out pretty good a few years ago when Pixar released "toy story" and "a bugs life" because then it was original and groundbreaking, the new visual style made you forget flaws in the story.
Both will be more productive then watching this.
Watch the eyes, for example; they don't hold in one place, the character will say something and the eyes will go down a little bit, then to the side a little bit.
And then there are the actors, almost all of them the best Holland has to offer and a few of Germany's great.
A dim lit chapel, and then the knock on the door and the cry for help.
But then, after ten minutes or so, the audio became very irritating with horrible lip syncing.
And then the locations, though well chosen, did anyone really bother to recheck them before filming??
And then, halfway through the movie I became angry, very angry, this was not a movie made to do just to the book or to entertain the audience.
Was it all bad then?
And then they slap a boring, ordinary plot and bad logic on top of that.
When one of the girls is killed, we see the knife puncture her skin, then bizarrely the rest of the stabbing isn't even shown.
Even if you like the book, even if you think 14th century Frenchmen spoke modern French, even if you think 14th century English nobles spoke any kind of English at all; even if you can accept social customs, military tactics and critical architectural details that don't belong there OR then; this is just plain a slow, confused, predictable movie.
The only way you should ever see this is if you are payed at least ten bucks, then maybe you could consider.
Maybe, to make it easier for her to grasp, they only give her a few basic lines in French such as "allez, Allez" and then suddenly her knowledge of the English language suddenly improves tenfold and her accent comes and goes in spasms.
Like the typical series film, Tim never seems to shoot anyone except in the hand, he catches people trying to murder him and takes their guns--then lets them go, and never slugs anyone unless it absolutely can't be helped.
Maybe it would have been enjoyable had they maced some dude in the face, then clubbed him in the jewels and the suspect were to sing, "...by golly, that smarts..." or something.
When they touch these light sources, their tentacles then turn into festive sparklers and flail about, only to shed drops of blood which then reproduce more monsters as excelled speeds.
You can then run away from the monster.
It was made in the late 1960's (around the same time as perhaps the greatest or certainly one of the greatest sci-fi films of all times: 2001) showing the future with technology that would have been dated even then.
In which we first learn that the characters will be searching for a certain "jewel," then half way though the production, the problem is solved, and a new one then opens: a villain named Omar wishes to take over the world.
The watching experience is different but the result is not better than bad comedy, scarcely extracting a smile now and then.
"Fat Pizza" on the other hand seems to have been made in a couple of weeks by someone who's idea of a joke is to say f*** a few times and then bleep it out.
This movie is insane... Haven't ever seen so bad movie ,if you wanna see the worlds worst movie ,then this is it!!!!
Even then, you might regret taking up a space in your queue with this nonsense.
I remember seeing the ad campaign but I never saw the movie because I was too young back then.
It's just them, and then this preacher guy shows up at the school --I have no idea how or why!!
And the psychotic preacher is shown at the end as a very regular "unpsychotic" preacher preaching at a service...then the boy who we see rise from the lake in the beginning, gets back on the bus, and gets driven to the lake.. and he walks back under the water to where he arose from... ends with a quote from the bible!!!
If he had gone to school with the six and they'd shoved him in a locker or otherwise mistreated him in some way in the past, then perhaps the rampage would make sense.
Since "Caballos Salvajes" I've been trying to figure out who the bad guys are in PiÃ±eyro's films (back then, bullets always came from outside the frame).
If you want to see a comedy, well then, you should rethink wasting your time, and just wait until something better comes out.
But then you expect great effects from even the most dim-witted of movies these days.
He plays such an interesting character ... and then the highly rated Christian Bale lives up to his previous acting job... a brilliant performance on his part.
But then, later in the year, they made this film.
If hit-to-the-groin jokes are your cup of tea, then look no further than Balls of Fury, the newest comedy from the minds behind Reno 911.
If, on the other hand, you're looking for something with a little more comedic value then men being hit in their nether regions, avoid Balls of Fury like the plague.
When Balls of Fury does manage to include some original jokes, it involves stuff like the aforementioned water park being built next to a tombstone, which sadly enough, is less funny then the blind man falling down a staircase.
Hell, you can even go see Halloween, as a film about a serial killer is bound to be more funny then this trash.
If you really enjoyed Rosemary's Baby, then you might actually watch this entire movie.
You see Collins recoiling in horror with scratch marks on her face, then cut to a picture of a very-undevilish baby looking all cutesy.
Or a hand reaching out and shoving a nurse into a pond then cut back to cutesy kid, pram blankets unruffled.
So, despite giving it a one, I strongly recommend you watch this crappy flick--then Plan 9 From Outer Space, The Apple, Roller Boogie and Jet Pilot.
Full of cheesy songs and I cringed whilst watching this, and then fell asleep about 40 minutes through.
We've got a girl with asthma, a semi-retarded gentle giant, an old man in a nursing home, a player's girlfriend in jail, unemployed bums and a drug-addict seeking a new chance in life, and then the obligatory big-match finale.
If you want to watch something that requires no thought, there's nothing else on, and you have nothing else to do, then and only then do I suggest that you watch this show.
But some comments on its cast members may be in order:  Â	Russ Tamblyn was a child star, then primarily a dancer.
And of course its view of teen-aged life in the second Eisenhower administration bears not the slightest resemblance to any reality Â then or now.
I never understand people who'll go to a movie like Threesome and then groan at two men kissing.
They could have had an interesting story arc if Sam had at first allowed Buck some latitude then got cold feet later, but they didn't do that.
If the auditions were already closed, then no matter how much singing you do over the phone, they won't submit you.
So you still have basically the same things going on with the girls (Galleria gets big headed and then humbled, Chanel struggles with parental problems, Dorinda enjoys dancing) with the addition of Aqua and her fashion thing.
Korol Lir is structured to begin with, but then it ends up being fairly similar to one of these black and white videos.
At least my brother's videos were in English though - but then, I guess I wouldn't have stayed awake through most of this film if I didn't have to read the subtitles.
But, if the whole point of the film is for the viewer to bite their nails at this horrifying monster popping up out of nowhere, then it fails miserably.
You may prepare yourself for the worst, and then still "The Terror Within" will surpass your most cautious expectations.
They all have a great time together and then things go wrong after a strange motor/fashion show.
But, if you find these types of films irresistible and are a die hard fan of the show then I guess you'll watch and enjoy this movie regardless, as it was mainly aimed at its fan-base.
And when it's all finally over... all you seem to have done is wasted 2 hours of your life... ...and then the bad cover of "Every Breath You Takes" starts up.
If you're looking for Scott Bakula eye candy, then this is not the best you can do - he has a terribly fake moustache and the only scenes he is remotely attractive in, is when he has a singlet on and you can only see his back.
This is one of the few movies I have seen from beginning to end and then seeing it on MST 3000.
This is set in the south so everyone revs up the southern accent to intolerable levels (I live here and I have yet to hear anyone sound that southern) then there is Mic who is from New York.
It's very fake and not the real life in the Hasidic community, boys are smarter then this boy sounds, he knows how to take a train and get around the city and goes to clubs but cant buy himself a pair of jeans.
Charles Dance is too old to play Max De Winter (he's supposed to be 15 - 20 years older then her, not 30) and he lacks any sense of darkness or anger.
She had already had an amazing rise and fall in the US, then to Europe where she found her greatest roles.
Nicholl then agrees to manufacture the ceramic coating needed for re-entry and to accompany Barbicane on a flight to the moon.
But then again some people like pretentious and artificial films.
Finally, I think this film is more important for white Americans then black Americans.
And then maybe through these films both blacks and whites can find some common ground and truly co-exist with mutual love and respect.
If you remember the dreadful photo stories from the girly teen comics of the 80's, (so brilliantly parodied in UK adult comic Viz) then imagine a moving picture version with violence, and you will be most of the way toward understanding the feel and presentation of this film.
Unless you are a film student and want to view this from the point of view of a director/ editor, then I strongly recommend that you avoid spending any money on this at all.
Ryan then takes the remote and returns to watching the MMA fight and is visibly excited by the action.
If you're looking for a film featuring homo-erotica, BDSM and MMA to watch with your guy buddies then this is the flick for you.
But then I saw it again as an adult and the awful truth came out: 1) it is impossible for Steve Reeves to even try to act; 2) it is impossible for the supporting cast to act; 3) the sort of monster the argonauts face when they find the golden fleece is definitely funny (though he probably puts on the best acting of all); 4) Reeves's hairdo is unthinkable in ancient Greece; 5) any other ingredient you may think of.
But then, why did I vote with a 3 mark?
If you LIKE cheap and sloppy films (I know I sure do), then this is definitely for you.
If not, then see the Disney version.
Unless you are 10 years old or younger, then you might find yourself mildly entertained!
getting very excited about some crazy plastic toy that had lots of bells and whistles, then begging their mother to buy it for them and explaining how many amazing ways they'll use it and how this specific G.I.
It would be nice if we took all these ideas and ressurected Seinfeld--then they'd have competent people actually doing the scripts and performing!
Had the film brushed aside its lame story and been more of a musical revue of showstoppers, (like HAIR, or CHICAGO, or GODSPELL or anything by Busby Berkeley or Astaire and Rodgers) then the superficiality of the material would be irrelevant.
The opening credits role and then the cast sings 521,600 Minutes and its all downhill from there.
- and then being disappointed.
Far too noisy,far too long,far from subtle.And it had Lance Percival in it.I don't really need to go on but I shall because "Too late the hero" or 'ero as our professional cockney might have it, is one of the worst kind of movies.The kind that pretend to be one thing but turn out to be quite another.Here we have a bash - crash no prisoners war movie full of squaddies with gritted teeth firing machine guns at other squaddies with gritted teeth accompanied by belicose music ,dramatic sunlight through the trees and much crunching of the undergrowth.One by one the good guys are killed off until only the professional cockney and the smug yank are left and then there's a rousing climax as they race across a huge expanse of open ground the Brits have inexplicably left unmined outside their camp until one of them gets his and the other collapses at the feet of his lantern - jawed C.O.
The idea of this movie is that a person that the common population would call this person a looser and then after being thrown into a barrel of toxic waste, mutated into a superhero that is completely disfigured sounded OK even for 1985.
Well then you maybe should rent that video.
Sounds more like an ABC reality show then something that would happen in real life.
Next major issue, if the "goblins" were vegetarians, then why turn people into vegetables when they can grow their own!
The climax, the ending of the film leaves the impression that Josh destroys all the Goblins, then the other shoe drops.
This "sequel" was directed by Claudio "Drake Floyd" Fragrasso who brought us such classics as 'Zombi 3' and 'Zombie 4: After Death,' and if you've seen either of those movies before seeing this one then maybe you know what to expect.
They consider it to be the best bad movie of all time, even greater then the cult favorite Plan 9 from outer space.
Overall if you enjoy b movies or bad movies, then this is your film.
If you hate bad movies, then avoid it at all cost.
So what threat are they to humans then?
How clever they are to call the town that the family are moving to 'Nilbog' and then show a shot of a sign for the town in the cars side mirror, clearly showing the word 'Goblin' This film deserves an Oscar!
I didn't get into how Elliot was getting naked with his friends and watching porno stuff with monkeys and bad music, but since your friends are not even worried about how corn and vegetables will kill you, then it makes sense that you button up your shirt when your girlfriend shows up unexpected.
So they're Goblins not Trolls, then why throw in a Leprachaun mythos by having them all be burned with clover scars and evil green St.Patty's day food?
Had the acting, story, effects, dialogue, any one of those not been as awful as they are in this film then Troll 2 simply would not be the same.
The goblins then eat them.
And then they're going to eat me!
You know the kind of dead where you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come back and then you give your 12 year old grandson a Molotov cocktail and then you say you will be gone forever and then you come backÂthat kind of dead.
Holly then explains that her parents don't like Elliott (that he is a good for nothing) and that they are going on vacation for a month.
Ellliott then asks, "Is it true you're going on vacation tomorrow?"
He and his beautiful wife then go to London to kill off the Van Helsing family.
Ultimately, If you're not hardcore-Lewis, then don't even think about it, but If you must own them all, then own them all.
!....total WASTE of sound producing instruments and the efforts of those who were reproducing the notes...i thanked my Atheist gods for every second of silence from the chatter-clatter of the music....  And i can't see why ANYONE would've gone to see this piece of (expletive deleted) except the reviews told me that Viggo's wife in the film had something to do with the band X ...oh well...then it was clearly word of mouth that brought drugged fans into the theater....
The US, mindful of Iraqi business, supported them for the first few years, but then sold weapons to Iran to counter Iraq's growing success.
The movie depicts the gang as they rob banks and kill on a northward path along the Gold and Treasure Coasts of Florida, running just ahead of the then sheriff of Palm Beach County, who was determined to end their violent rampages.
"Time Walker" starts out iffy, gets worse, then when it just starts to get interesting...IT'S OVER!
Mummy's never really scared me.And this one definitely wasn't scary.I first saw this on MST3K years ago,then I saw it again the regular version.Wow!What a boring movie.Bland characters,stupid monster,bad plot.The only way I'd recommend seeing this is to see the mistied version.
If you must watch it, check out episode 405 of Mystery Science Theater 3000, even then it was hard to get through without walking away.
(yes it was actually in movie theaters for a BRIEF time) It sucked then and it sucks now.
But if you want to know how a mummy, ancient diamonds, green dust that turns into flesh-devouring fungus, a blue-skinned alien with big black eyes and a college campus tie in all together, then you might want to consider watching TIME WALKER.
And then come around some day and blame me for having watched a bad movie.
It all starts off with some stock footage of planets and then of Egypt.
The ending is very cheesy, as the mummy reveals himself to actually be an alien (someone wearing a ridiculous mask) and then disappears to the stars, and the fateful words "To be continued..." appear on the screen.
and then is beamed up with the alien.
The lone man then proceeds to do weird 'sickening' acts such as smelling the average looking woman's knickers.
Were then treated to yet another 'lets tie the woman up and torment her' type of scenarios....we also have not so shocking 'could this be incest' moments when the lone man suddenly has a daughter type tagging along to help him in his deeds.
These two people go to this lodge in the middle of the forest and there is some creepy guy and then he ends up being more than a creep.
The beginning of the movie is worth an 8, from then on it's all down the hill.
First of all, the begin credits makes one insane, text, 5 seconds movie, text, movie, text, and then movie finally begins.
If you're watching because your class is reading the story... well then tell your teacher that the class should read a more interesting Henry James story.
I won't waste my time reviewing a piece of bubble gum like this suffice it to say that bubble gum, every now and then, is kind of fun but gets stale quickly.
The one little thing that I wish the director would have done is have the two 'alien' nerds from homeroom, standing on the curb as they all ride off (Teri and boyfriend & younger brother with biker-gal)and the mother ship 'arrives' and the two nerds look up, smile, a light shines down on them and both turn to glittering matter swirling upward to the ship and then head back into the cosmos.
If the language and violence are not your cup of tea, then it would be best to stay away.
And then then you all talk about the lesson you just learned!
At first I actually thought I was watching a rerun of a Buffy episode, but then I realized that even Buffy wasn't that bad (and there weren't any commercials!).
Reluctantly, Harper confesses, and the once philandering football star blackens his eye at their stag party and then threatens to throw him off the balcony.
Lance calls off the wedding without warning Mia and then storms out of the party.
The physical slapstick doesn't work either, someone being hit by a broom and then pulling a silly face before they fall over just isn't amusing as far as I'm concerned.
Love at First Bite is the sort of film that thinks Dracula drinking the blood of a drunk and then becoming drunk himself and singing & a woman being shown a mouse who then runs away screaming is funny.
If not, then the local drug-dealing skank (her cousin) will inherit it because no one knows that this blonde floozy is evil.
But then again, it's far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age, that there's probably no one that should watch this movie at all.
If you like your drama to be slightly slower than normal, then this may be for you, but even those who appreciate thought provoking over action will still be bored senseless by this absolute tripe.
The plot then goes into her flying delivery service way too much, and not enough into interesting things.
She's a happy-go-lucky bumbling 13-year-old girl, until she comes upon a friend who happens to be a boy her age, and then she acts like a cold-hearted shrew.
it starts good then degenerates into Pinochio (sp)?
The most amusing part of my whole viewing experience was when a man in his mid 30's, young family in tow, began to walk out of the cinema and then, once he reached the aisle, turned to face the screen and shouted "B*ll@#ks!!!"
But then things go wrong, Johnson meets a Pro Bono lobbyist, falls in love with her pretty fast but their relationship doesn't add anything to the movie and is not developed and chemistry between both actors is obviously missing.
Along with that came his (then) shocking and hilarious comedy albums.
In 1992 it seemed he had rebounded with "Boomerang" but then came this.
The smart aleck humor seemed tired for a man (then) 30 years old.
Having worked as a social worker and then therapist with sexual abuse victims, this 19th century attitude towards the sexualization of children is quite sad.
The plot is based loosely on the actual case by what was shown, using the most catchy of scenes and then over-glorifying them.
it's drier then a 10th grade history lecture.
If you think that there's little comic potential to be had from the exploits of a bus company then... you'd be right.
Scrooge then asks Marley, in a curiously philosophical manner, why spirits walk the earth.
Unfortunately, there is an extremely awkward moment in which he appears to be choking, then bursts into laughter.
While I praised Patrick Stewart, I was disappointed that I did not see a building of his remorse, then the transformation.
All-in-all, this movie isn't a bad way to kill a couple of hours, during the Holiday Season, but watch the 1935 version first, then this one, and get them out of the way, before you see the much better ones.
If I had the chance to meet a star that a girl I hated wanted to meet so bad AND crashed his party, and then no one believed me, I'd feel really bad and annoyed.
Why did she get into a play, then go to a concert with a friend and meet her idol, then come back and star in the play after some girl told her she wasn't at the after party but she knew she was and so did her friend and then a guy who she had spoken to about twice asked her out or something like that?
And what was with her friend following her around all the time crying and saying " oh i can't lie to my parents", but then doing it anyway and being so happy when she got grounded?
This movie leans toward Lola becoming a actress, but then completely turns off that subject, when Lola discovers her favorite band is going to be in New York, and absolutely has to be back for the ultimate concert, dragging her best friend along with her.
As if you would sneak to a concert, see the rock star you love, save his life, your dad and him become best friends, he turns up at a party and returns your a necklace and then you and him get together and become best mates.
It was more about Stu and the concert then drama!
Lindsay Lohan is given tons of parental support, and all she does is squirm and complain and then tells her parents that they make HER HIGHNESS uncomfortable!
The plot revolves around a girl from New York City who moves to somewhere in Jersey and then attempts a new school.
First, Mary tries out for the school play and then she tries to get into the final concert of everyone's favorite band, Sidarthur.
Vogel then goes around in the name of god torturing and killing the people involved, cleansing their souls in the process, and eventually kidnapping the sexy Anne, who he keeps tied up naked in his house so he can torture her whenever he wants.
If you don't crack up when someone says something totally pointless or if you just don't like worthless humor then you'd do best in staying away from this movie.
If you must watch this movie, then you might not want to invite any new people over just in case of the whole first impression thing.
The plot is riddled with holes which leave you wondering what just happened and was it significant, then later on you find out that it wasn't.
And then the aluminium rims.
then there is a dark sequence going until the goal moment of the movie, which isn't even surrounded, then all is coming back to normality.
She attempts later to seduce Allain Getty then follows this with a very destructive visit to Getty's wife.
If you like to watch movies that don't have any real direction then this movie is for you.
Gen-X cops starts out well and interesting, but then the movie goes on autopilot- -it turns into a mindless action picture.
Central villains are killed off for unexplained reasons, and then, another bad guy enters the picture.
I also enjoyed watching the taking of the bomb up an unknown number of floors to a roof, starting a helicopter and then flying an estimated 25 miles off shore and all in 4 minutes and 30 seconds.
Even Steven Seagal has two partners who appear for 1 minute at the beginning of the movie, then 1 minute halfway through the movie, and both are killed only 2 minutes later.
I didn't know that, but then again, I also always thought you had to wear some kind of foil suit to handle raw plutonium, but I guess that's not really true.
The goal is to get a nuclear weapon away from the bad guys and then away from the populace before it detonates and kills millions of people.
Seagal is not too bad here for a whole 15 minutes he is engaging then goes about the sleepwalking that he has done for his last 2 movies.Whoever is doing his fighting is doing a commendable job.
It did not set the world on fire to my memory.I can only hope they inject the next Forigner sequel with some class,imagination,Less stunt doubles and a livelier Seagal.If not then leave Jonathon Cold on Ice.
If one makes historical costume dramas then at least tread the genre with some responsibility and don't grossly twist and distort history.
But then, the focus was to make a fairy tale.
By then she was a survivor's survivor and new all the in's and out's of Renaissance Europe's Machiavellian politics.
"Golden Age" set the target high and then turned and fired in the opposite direction.
but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then.
One example is when he tells Stevens his friend is dead then asks if he can make himself an ice cream soda.
A bigoted video full of nothing but lies and hatred.Use this video to teach your kids about how to identify a bigot,and tell them how these anti-PETA Nazis spread lies and vicious rumours about PETA.If you're a Penn & Teller fan,then you'll be horrorfied and deeply saddened to learn the ugly truth about Penn & Teller.You'll cry as you hear the vicious lies Penn & Teller spread about PETA,and you'll never want to be their fan ever again.Yes-Penn & Teller are bigoted people,jumping on the anti-PETA bandwagon to help control people with hate,lies,bullying and fear.Now that you know the ugly truth about Penn & Teller,you will quicjkly be against them.
I know it was more than just voodoo because I had tried to loose weight for 20 years before then and nothing had ever worked.
If someone is a fake their fair game, but why find a hypnotist who is good and then try to make them look bad?
If the rest of the shows are like that one, (and from many of the reviews, it seems like they are), then this show is flat out drivel.
Their approach to the world is a backward one - they choose a stance on a subject and then seek ways to validate it.
They have the habit of bringing in 1-2 EXPERTS who are completely on their side...and then they bring in 2-3 morons who poorly represent the other side.
Nowadays I think they are sellouts who's obviously not doing well with the magic business (cause then they wouldn't have to take part of this crap, would they?).
It was as though there was a camera crew commissioned to shoot some footage and then it was thrown together in a hurry.
And from then on began the decent into maelstrom.
It then cuts to what turns out to be its anthem.
But even then the film is minced with cutaways of the directors smearing their signature over it.
There are some golden moments but they are few and far between and could easily have been summarized in a 15 minute documentary rather than a full feature that seems only to try to prove, by "deconstructing" the documentary process that it is virtually impossible to do a documentary because the subject is aware of the camera and then doesn't act completely naturally.
You can find him in his books, but if you want to gawk at him, then check out this video.
then put her face to face with a sleazy diamond merchant/slave farm owner.
I'm not sure what to make of Michael York's character in here-- he starts out likable, then turns into a heel, then winds up being the one who investigates and learns the truth about The Phantom, while the police inspector is merely a DOLT.
My recommendation to anyone interested in these films is, START here-- then work your way backward to 1963, then 1943, then 1925.
It's was no surprise then to me that Mirimax and others wouldn't distribute it, and the offers they got were so small.
We have a guy from Omaha, then an Irishman from Boston," or something like that.
However, if you don't want the truth, then put your mind in neutral and watch this movie.
We see a long sequence of the plane scooting around, then another sequence where the footage they shot just wasn't long enough.
Even then, the filmmakers felt a need to drag out every moment as long as possible.
But then there is the dialogue.
They decide to open a flower shop in Los Angeles and Kate blackmails a man named Jack (Joel Gretsch) so he will seduce Sara and then dump her but Jack really learns to like her instead.
Characters change allegiances then change back without any explanations whatsoever.
if a movie is called "War of the robots" then i better see robots BATTLING EACH OTHER!
If men in their thirties and forties sporting Buster Brown haircuts and silver jumpsuits is your idea of a menacing brigade of androids, then this flick is for you.
Watching Antonio slap the Buster Brown bots with this toy sword - and then laughing at the method at which the robots die - makes for unintentional hilarity).
He is then free to reveal his the role he has been playing all along.
Clearly made in Italy and then dubbed over in America to hopefully make more more money, this is a horribly done copy of Star Wars.
If you've read all the other reviews you will notice that the first ones - the negative ones - came from people who saw the 1994 series first then experienced the 2000 PAX remake with shock and horror.
Faring somewhat better is the always reliable Laura Linney, who gets to look gorgeous for a change and then uncover a wickedly vituperative woman rattled by her deep-seeded insecurity.
But then I realized that was her character's name and that would be her name throughout the film.
If you have never seen the Devil Wears Prada, then you will most likely enjoy this film.
If you have seen the Devil Wears Prada, then this film may look good to you on the rental shelf, but ultimately feel cheep once you get it home, as most knock-off's do.
They then take refuge at Barlow's "uncle's" (Ralph Moody) ranch and await contact from the gang.
Check out the character of Randolf who starts off by speaking in a scouse accent then when he gets found out reverts to an Australian accent .
- there is - and then!!!
Even then, there's not much there.
Most of the cards were at the end and by then I didn't care what was being said.
Well, I must admit that the rest of the film DID feature better acting and it seemed that if Hitchcock made this movie linearly (from start to finish), then you can see how his direction improved as the film unfolded.
This reminds me of other early 80's horror films like the Hallowing, that where good then, but lame now.
First and foremost, Chuck is a poor actor then and now.
Prince of Darkness is a bad movie from John Carpenter.the whole thing is ridiculous.take the premise,for example.A priest has discovered a long hidden canister containing the liquid form of Satan himself,or rather his son.said canister had been hidden deep within the basement of an ancient church.upon discovering it,said priest decides to call upon physics Prof and students to investigate it.soon,the liquid ends up in most of the students(don't ask) turning then into mindless drones whose only purpose is to aid the son(said liquid)into freeing daddy aka Satan.Anyway,the whole thing is ludicrous even for sci-fi/fantasy/horror.there just isn't any point.Carpenter really misses the mark here.With all due respect to the late,great Donald Pleasence,what was he thinking?the only redeeming feature of this movie is that it is (marginally)less awful than "Slither" and "Lawnmower Man 2".
So then they play that dream clip a few more million times.
You then see the look on her face as she realizes just how royally screwed she is.
If you don't like Christian shows, then do not watch them.
But then reason took over.
Despite Wesley's jealousy, it is ridiculous that he would be much quicker to believe Jim over Charlotte, but then again, the first time Wesley expresses his love for Charlotte is during a period of sex.
The effects were cheesy, it was PAINFULLY slow, and worst of all, Roy Thinnes has a total of about ten minutes screen-time across the first part and then vanishes.
Then, some sheep with their eyes covered, and then a bear.
If you love Bush, then you will find a forest here.
For instance, can you really learn anything by sticking a tube in a woman's ear and then blasting her eardrum with several atmospheres of pressure?
Sergio Garrone's "SS Experiment Camp" is a total failure on every possible level.This film was banned in Britain as a video nasty,but it surely isn't as outrageous as many people claim.In fact it's pretty tame even by today's standards.There is some torture and humiliation and lots of nudity and soft-core sex.Some scenes are pretty mean-spirited for example one woman who refuses to go through the experiments is put into the tank.The temperature is first put up to almost boiling point and then the dial is turned the other way making it icy cold.Still the film is extremely dull,so fans of Italian exploitation may be disappointed.Avoid this one like the plague-watch "Beast in Heat" or "Gestapo's Last Orgy" instead!
He then runs naked through the camp in search of the commandant.
Or at least more inventively, the survivors of the first film had flogged the story of the first film and then admit to the new members of the cast that 'it actually happened and to us and that's why were in trouble because we decided to shortcut through the same bit of desert and got stuck'.
At the start, one of the survivors of part 1 is telling his psychiatrist why he can't go back to the desert and then promptly disappears for the rest of the film.
She then claims to the kids that she is the now legendary Ruby.Pluto takes off on one of the bikes.
But then again maybe he was lying.
For me, Craven is a hit-or-miss film maker but when you read up that he needed quick cash then you should be well aware of what you're in for; The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 is it.
If you're a fan of slasher films, then this is fairly entertaining - though maybe for the wrong reasons.
Gernerally regarded as being one of the worst sequels ever committed to film, this begins with about five minutes of flashbacks to the first film, followed by a cheap shock (guy sneaking into girlfriend's room in a mask) , then more flashbacks.
There was not a hint of depth to her character, but then there probably shouldn't have been.
But then that would have precluded the contrived drama following, and left an hour's blank film in the camera.
I'm sure that by now most people are aware that IMDb reviews are a breeding ground for hype from the people involved in the film itself, if not then beware of all the high ratings/reviews a lesser known film receives, especially early on when the film's newly/barely even been released.
But someone came up with a great first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes, and then promptly did a runner, leaving their abandoned 5 year-old daughter to finish it off.
I suggest you watch the intro, then do something more useful like counting the hairs on your forearm, and make sure you set your alarm to ensure that you don't miss the ending.
Suddenly Hope wakes up to find herself in a wooden coffin, a day later a man (Eric Colvin) lets her out but then ties a rope around her neck to a tree & balances her on a log, inside a deep wound in her stomach is a razor blade to cut through the rope & save herself from choking, Hope manages to reach inside her own body to find the blade & cut the rope.
After this first test the man then chains her to a tree & makes her clean his pots & pans & tend a little vegetable patch in the middle of a forest, as you would.
Broken is a strange film & hard to categorise, it starts off feeling like a Saw (2004) imitator with a gruesome trap of some sort but then it settles down into a bizarre imprisonment film as this seemingly random man keeps Hope chained to a tree in a forest so she can wash his dirty pans & grow vegetable's for him.
The two barely speak a word to each other & even then it's just short sentences, there's no idle chit-chat here as Hope develops a strong bond with a flower & the opportunity for a conversation with a flower is limited to say the least.
Even then she still has problems: an overbearing boss, a fruitcake mother, a totally anal boyfriend, and a bitchy co-worker.
then she's bound to a tree with a razor-blade in her stomach which she can pull out and save herself.
They couldn't find a less threatening guy to play the antagonist then they one in the film.
If, for some reason, you're absolutely determined to see this film then do; if not, don't go out of your way to find it.
Why then go by herself when Amanda was so terrified to leave the club with Yule snooping around outside?
The film tries to put everything together at the end but falls sadly apart with the killer exposing himself with nobody watching really caring who he is by then.
In the LK1, Scar was certainly alone with only the hyenas to support him; if the outlanders had existed then, wouldn't they have helped him too?
I saw this movie in video club, I rented and my first thought was: "oh, this must be a special edition in DVD of an old movie" and then you check the box of it and it says that this movie was made in 2003.
It is far more advanced then this excuse of a horror.
Amateur hour performances, exhausted dialogue, totally ridiculous use of the camera, and then there was the big finale [a concoction as stale as last week's salad].
If black and white is your thing then fine & I have no problem watching black and white films but Nadja just looks so dark, bland & uninteresting.
If you like this sort of bizarre boring, black and white art-house stuff then Nadja is probably right up your street so I can recommend it to you but if your looking for a proper film with decent horror & an actual story then avoid this piece of crap like the plague, that's just my opinion & I'm sure there is an audience out there for a film like Nadja but it's not for me.
The dwarf licks the whip he has been using to beat the girl, and then he takes a tuft of goat hair and licks that.
She is disappointing in that she comes on so strong at the beginning and then lets go of her whole temperance thing.
I will admit that I was finishing an "art" project for the first fifteen minutes or so, but even then, when I wasn't really paying attention, I could tell that this was going to be a terrible movie.
The girls, who volunteer as sacrifices in order to achieve eternal life, are then resurrected from the dead as mindless zombies.
Did he start out with a ton of gory scenes, but then cut them out because he was aiming for a PG?
If you do give the movie a try, then don't take it too seriously.
It is also very easy to see where things are going so if you want something that will test you, then don't watch it.
This movie had all of the makings of a great movie....the beginning action pulls you in, interesting plot....you relate to Harrison Ford's character and his surroundings asap...the villains are unlikeable heavy's...then mid way through the movie, the pace of the film changes and comes across as something that seemed as though it was being added to as the movie was made..or not enough was deleted and cut out of the film...in some cases, the "Jack Ryan" and "Fugitive" resemblances start peeking in...but Harrison Ford is such a great actor,you cannot help but like his ability to play anger and frustration...and this movie plays on that...
But then he's President Ford again, dropping bad guys and saving families!
Even ignoring the one gigantic plot hole in this film - Bill Cox (Paul Bettany) meticulously plans his dastardly deed after seemingly months of research, but then is ignorant of one incredibly crucial point - the film sputters along without much energy.
It tries, lamely, to suck you in with slick visuals like the nice house, office, cars, etc... then delivers nothing by way of plot that you haven't seen 10,000 times before.
If you are a big HF fan then you need to see this but it was hard to watch him try to keep up his action hero persona as he actually stumbles and falls in some of the scenes.
Take a gray-haired Harrison Ford, place him in a business suit and then have him fight someone conveniently wearing all black, and you'd swear you were watching any number of movies from the last fifteen years.
It's been fourteen years since, "Patriot Games", in which Ford played a man that seemed over the hill then, and here he is today in the same situations.
Jack then hunts them down, and none of this comes as a surprise due to the formulaic structure of the picture.
If they are trying to steal money, then having less people to divvy up the bounty would result in a greater payday.
Basically Meredyth Holmes thinks there is more to life than sex but then thanks to an alien visitor (who of course is a studly guy) she realises she might have been wrong.
If you like Balkan humor, then you should not miss this one.
I was kinda forced into watching this film having started reading through 'American Silent Film' by William Everson (a very good book, I hasten to add on, er, well the title says it all) and encountering an entire chapter on, first, 'Birth of a Nation' (which I duly watched) and, then, 'Intolerance'.
The film started life as the 'Modern Story only' prior to 1916 which was then used as the basis to have the other two main and one rather sketchy story cut into it (the Jesus narrative is, to be honest, not a story but a series of excerpts from the life which support the other three stories at certain points).
I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you liked the first movie....... then steer clear of this one.....
Lynn Williams as Jax doesn't do bad, but then he's thwarted by the plot...  Ouch, the plot.
I'm a fan of the game, and was excited when hearing of the movie coming out, and then a sequel, right on!
Infact, some characters in this movie appear out of nowhere, fight some other character that has appeared out of nowhere, and then neither are seen again for the rest of the film.
I watched the original Mortal Kombat when I was about 10 years old, and it was bloody brilliant to me back then, it's still "ok" not absolute garbage, unlike its sequel.
RAIDEN btw, is now a less-hardcore version of the original kick ass Christopher Lambert Raiden, if you're gonna remove Lambert, then you need someone fairly bad ass, so what do they do?
I only suspend my disbelief so much - then I start becoming frustrated and asking questions like: How the heck does somebody travel through the molten core of the earth in a sailing American Gladiators ball?
If i could give this movie a Zero , i would.. this sequel was TOTALLY unnessasary ...   First of all , Christopher Lambert wasnt in it as "Lord Rayden" and i dont even know who the heck the actor was that portrayed Him..  >>>>>SPOILER AHEAD>>>>>>> then secondly, "Johnny Cage" was a different actor too, not Linden Ashby.. and i didnt know who that actor was either.. and then right near the start of the movie, "Johhny" gets killed .. im sorry i ever rented this stinker in the first place.. i was expecting it to be similar to the first one.. Oh was I ever Wrong!!
Sub Zero: Shows up, says hi, fights and kills botty Smoke, tells Liu Kang "you are not ready", then disappears, never to be heard from again.
A few quick examples, all from the same 10 minute stretch:  Rayden leaves Sonya, and tells her to find her buddy Jaz, then to head to "The Temple of the Elder Gods".
From then on you have a sub-standard martial arts film packed full of cheap costumes on cheap actors following a cliched script.
If you really feel the need to see this movie and be surprised, then be forewarned because there are spoilers ahead.
Mr. Wolf then briefly shows Liu how to do it, and then asks,  "pretty cool, huh?"
And if you do insist on seeing this movie, then at the very least inject some fun into it like trying to figure out where those Baraka masks were purchased.
Only he saved it from getting a 1, but even then, the rest prevented it from getting any more than a 2.
Then, if you're going to replace a character with another actor (Christopher Lambert), then at least make sure the new actor does a batter job than the first.
Highlight: the film class scene where Broderick's lecturer salivates over The Godfather II as he talks about it, then plays a clip from it, and we see him mouthing the words along to it.
And then... What a disappointment!
After watching this film ask yourself who Eddie Coyle's friends were, what were they like and what kind of relationship Eddie had with them, and then you'll understand what I am talking about.   
There is horror in this movie, but it's more from the realization that those hillbillies from the beginning were probably related then from the actual story.
Go home and burn a piece of paper with the name of the movie on it in effigy, and then bathe yourself for even associating with the title of this piece of crap.
If it had a higher production budget, better Special F/X, A-List actors (such as Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt or Harrison Ford) a top rate director (such as Steven Spielberg, and a better movie title, then maybe this movie could've been put on the list as one of the Science Fiction classics.
Evidently, it was a lot easier to be entertained back then.
And then putting all their mates into the cast and the result speaks for itself.
If you like boring movies then I suggest you to watch this movie.
I don't need a rich film maker telling me "You're doomed" for two hours and then offering no real solutions other than universal health care- which he knows will be difficult to get by congress.
Its a well made manipulative film, but other than inducing anger and depression it doesn't enlighten or point away anywhere, well it does- anywhere but the US- then again it doesn't show you the downside of not being here.
If Quentin Tarantino and a woman made out of horrible movies had a baby and then punched it in the head a lot...it would also hate this movie.
Hm, why is the lead character smiling all the time then?
It looks like a soft porn film with a fantastic looking-star, opens with a tease of a sex scene, and then deteriorates into a soft porn story-line with VERY little pay-off.
The ending made me furious--she goes through a thoroughly unbelievable search for the guy who got her into this mess, uncovers plenty of evidence to clear herself then breaks her own foot to escape!
The killer takes the girl's picture, tapes her hands and then puts one of those movie notes in her mouth for Detectives Michael Madsen and Chris Penn to find, complete with magazine clipped lettering.
), then he hooks up with Edwige, seemingly immediately moving in to her apartment, moaning about his coffee, and reading the paper while ignoring her.
Our motorcycle-helmeted killer starts working his way through the cast, and I won't really go into much detail about it as it's a giallo, but if you want to see an extremely fat man trying it on with a model, then this is the film for you.
A Fine Mess is a perfect description of this movie..Ted Danson and Howie Mandel star in this disaster about a couple of goofs who overhear a plan to dope a horse and then get involved and chased.
But for a movie that basically features two losers crossing the mob in a horse race then moving a piano to a rich lady's house, this film is all over the place.
So many people introduced then forgotten, plot lines that go nowhere, laughs that are fun for the moment but have no context.
There were separate moments here and there that gave me a smile but, like the movie itself, it just lives for the moment, then is gone.
At one point, amidst wild gunfire, a uniformed policeman tells the arriving detective, "he's up there and he's got one of our men as hostage", and then resumes shooting in the general direction.
Now, there are unexpected pleasures to be wrought from watching obscure movies now and then, and while I generally am pretty resistant to the 'oh wow, I've been there' effect, I did find the 1972 vintage shots of 'Place Jacques Cartier' and 'Rue St. Paul Est', well before the resurrection of the area as "Old Montreal' to be such a surprise.
Because with all of these so called scientist, experts working on how to kill them you would think the solution would be harder then taking a trip to your local Home Depot.
This is getting better then that classic movie Frogs.
When his boss Maddy Rierdon discovers this she insists that the Locusts be destroyed but unfortunately a few of them escape and due to their massive re population powers they intensify to a deadly swarm that will within days eviscerate the entire crops of the United States...and then I assume settle in Hawaii for a vacation...sorry....Now Maddy together with her estranged boyfriend, and the scientist who created them must figure out a way to stop these locusts or save the countries crops from their destruction.
He shows no emotion or depth but then no one does.
One of them plays a mentally handicapped person and if you can't tell which one it is, then I think that says something about each of their acting abilities.
A very dangerous plan indeed, but the military isn't given the opportunity of coming up with laughably absurd ideas and then having them work.
and then tried to coast home on some pitifully thin technical excuse for a solution.
If your so board out of your mind and you can't sleep then laugh yourself to sleep at this movie.
If you have better things to do then you know what to do.
I simply play up to the part when she joins and then lose interest every time.
Simpson, the then 'Mr.
We are then asked to accept that the one acquaintance who does notice also has powers of deduction that make Sherlock Holmes look like a rank amateur and is able to work out precisely what has happened to the missing astronauts from the most tenuous of clues (such as the puzzled look of one of the astronauts' wives when her husband mentions where they spent their last family holiday).
If that's what you think, then just catch it next time on TNT (don't rent it, like I did) and post at least one funny line.
If you enjoy excessive bathroom humor, and can stand Chris Tucker for more than 10 minutes, then by all means, enjoy.
And then there were the Cat Woman, slinking around in leotards and dog collars.
Well, now that I'm older, I can see a lot of things that were not noticeable back then.
All of this for the final five minutes where Smith has an epiphany and then is absolved of his actions.
a fat guy who can only get it up with a blow up doll, and the ending where Edwidge says that she doesn't have to worry about getting pregnant because she takes the pill, then her boyfriend says they shouldn't risk it .....  i would highly recommend this film to trashy film fans.
If you haven't seen "Midsommer", then I recommend you to see it first (if you can) before "Solstice".
The body of the wandering ghost is found and then she/he can rest in peace, and justice is made finally.
Or are the messages coming from the innocent girl that Iceman killed last summer and then buried without telling anyone?
At first I half expected to see Leslie Nielsen appear, then it gradually dawned on me that this was supposed to be taken seriously.
It seems to me that if you are going to make a film about a historic event (the largest robbery in New York City history), then you should make the effort to create it for the correct time period.
If you're looking for a film that gives some idea of the events that lead up to the heist, then this film is fine, otherwise, don't waste your time.
Anybody could make a machine, destroy it, blame his neighbor for making him destroy it and then go into a 40 year rage about how it was the best invention since the beginning of time and they were robbed...but people would think he's a fool.
I probably shouldn't be reviewing this film until I watch it again (if I do), but I'll just revise my review then if appropriate.
Every time she is offered temptation, she always refuses but then tries EVERYTHING she is offered--making me wonder why they didn't call this film THE GIRL WHO COULDN'T SAY "NO"!
1st watched 2/17/2007 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Mrs. Wallace Reid & Melville Shyer): Interesting yet slow moving movie displaying many taboo subjects for back then including pre-marital sex, smoking and drinking in high school, nude swimming, an abortion, and older men with younger under-aged women and all being done under the radar of the well-meaning parents in the story.
But one can see why this technique failed in the sequel, "Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey," because by then (1991) audiences had grown weary of eighties teenagers in heinous situations.
Film companies should have learned then that while Bill and Ted were once good, and always will be, MORE of the same kind is tiring.
Action films tend to waste him and since then the good roles have somewhat dried up compared to his golden period in his Spike Lee collaborations, in White Men Can't Jump, New Jack City and King Of New York.
If you're into 'B Action' then maybe you'll get some enjoyment out of this.
Anyway, this movie started getting campy, then got corny, then hit the mediocre level to where it was boring and just too stupid for words.
I then turned it off and have USA network to thank for letting me watch it free on cable so I can save my money.
...then see this movie.
But then, you'd have nothing left to make a television show about.
If you want a good Voodoo film then try Skeleton Key, it's a bit glossy Hollywood but it's better than this.
And then, as if this weren't enough to swallow, suddenly there's a knock on the door with a guy warning the hubbie the wifey's been possessed.
Seems like back then, the under-30 crowd were forever keeping their elders bewildered.
But very few young people, were actually as brutal back then, as they're portrayed to be in this movie.
The "plot" only just starts to unfold itself after an hour into the film, when a courageous boy stands up against the vicious gang but then gets falsely accused, threatened and targeted for vengeance.
For kicks, then, they fry a guy's hand on the stove, burn newspapers that sit right in front of the camera and smash apart a baby carriage.
Wouldn't they detain him then anyway?
Throughout the film we see him making bad decisions, and never really taking responsibility - and then the final cop-out (which I won't reveal).
And then, 5 minutes later, when they are in London, he is completely broke and so are they.
I thought that it was almost as if they had started on a movie and then midway decided to change the plot.
I recommend watching the first two minutes and then fast forwarding through the rest.
When it comes to High Concept Pictures, this ranks up there with Jules White's "Dogville" series, in which inoffensive puppies are stuffed into costumes, wired into position and then made to stand around, urinating on themselves, after which voices are dubbed into a satire of "the Face on the Bar Room Floor"; or "The Three Fatties" series: If they laugh at fat comics, and they laugh at at movie teams, then how about a movie team of three men who tip the scale at 300 pounds each?
Has to be seen to be believed, and even then you won't.
The story revolves around the bad guy in town named Bat Haines, who is fooling everybody and plotting two families against each other by stealing each other's calves and then setting it up so that each one blames the other.
Still, it's hard watching the picture not to crack up every now and then over inadvertently funny scenes like the midget cowboys riding on their Shetland ponies, or walking into a saloon under the swinging door.
When gratuitous nudity fails to redeem a movie for me, then there's something definitely wrong.
When an actor or actress does working class and does it realistically, then that's art.
), had read more of Pirandello (or at least the play of which we keep seeing excerpts) and had a more comprehensive knowledge of Goldoni - then I would understand the point of this movie.
The period up until then is wasted through over-drawn character development (which does little but establish every character as pretentious and confused, traits that are almost expected to some degree in romantic comedies) and many scenes of the play produced ("Come tu Mi Vuo", an Italian play that, from the excerpts presented alone, is already a better farce of romance in general than the film, but has no specific connection to the characters other than their participation in it).
However, had I not had to leave the set then, I'd have changed channels.
Essentially, I went into the movie expecting to learn something I didn't know, but instead came out bored stupid and amazed that even I, a child of the 80's who had no personal experience with the Lennon era, already knew everything the movie had presented, and then some.
then he goes back to the capitol city to try to rescue the Princess(who was in a wrestling match with a pair of lesbians) and stop the evil Queen and her creepy old High Priest adviser(Palance).
I am trying to make allowances for factors such as dubbing and translation but...no, even allowing for that, this thing obviously wasn't "written", it was assembled from the random output of 1000 monkeys sitting at typewriters, and then carefully edited to remove all trace of human feeling or dramatic veracity from the results.
There then follows interminable amounts of wandering about in the desert by Cabot and his midget henchman (I kid you not!).
She is just a poor replacement for the beautiful and pleasant Anastasia Dualla and Apollo is obviously an idiot, but then a lot of the characters on this show are idiots.
You don't need money to tell you to use more then 3 shots in an entire 20 minute scene, you don't need money to tell you that the wind is blowing in your boom mic, you don't need money to tell you that your actors are COMPLETELY half-assing the roles.
Technially The Great American Snuff Film is pretty poor, the colour seems very bright during daytime shots which give it a distracting & unrealistic look & then there's the awful music which plays constantly during the first half of the film & to make things worse sometimes it's louder than the dialogue spoken by the actors which is not a good combination.
The scene where Denzel uses his laser pointer to unveil the truth about the real function of the machine and then exclaims in such a dramatic tonality "Can anyone tell me WHAT-IS-GOING-ON-HERE" was just...funny and made me literally fall of my chair...
When you have untalented amateurs doing the job then this is what you will end up with - a pointless dreary mess that will make you YAWN while your ears are bleeding.
I used to like this show cos it's very entertaining, but then I started to feel more and more disturbed and guilty for those poor people, I couldn't watch it anymore.
When everything important happens at the last possible second, literally, then it's too contrived.
A couple of them get swept into the exhibits and the story that revolves around the exhibits, and then they get killed and become permanent parts of it.
In fact, everyone involved here deserves a, if not physical then atleast a verbal, lash or two.
In costume he changes and then he changes back.
But it seems that every time we see he is going to have that one chance - then snap- there goes the cutting room floor.
It is like this scenario; Artist A does a painting, Artist B does their own painting, but then places scenes and subjects from the work of Artist A. I am not sure how long this sequel was in planning or when it was decided, but thats the situation as I see it.
In Carrie 2 the character was much more believable, but then again this movie plays in the same league of bad movies.
I'd do both, I laugh and then I cry.
he was an "American" psycho...a fraud...a tacky, tacky fraud, as most people were in the 80's...as being the purpose of this book...to comment on the American condition during that time(and in my opinion it is still mostly apt) thus negating the premise of this entire movie...unless your an idiot and completely missed the point of either the book or the movie...then the movie will still suck!!!!!!!!!!!!
What is worse is that the narrator tells us she kept quiet about seeing a murder to avoid years of therapy, then goes to a therapist anyway, doesn't actually tell him anything, but invests great effort in inspiring fear in him, a character who had no relevance whatever to the protagonists plans.
This seems more like a girl power movie with over acting characters then a horror thriller.
And then there's a different director.
If so then the producers have succeeded
The movie keeps you waiting for something to happen and then disappoints when it does.
If one disagrees with my assessment, then he or she will still be free to buy a higher quality copy for future viewing.
If you like good movies, then stay away from this one.
But if you like your movies extra cheesy with a high count of boobies, then this is the one.
This film is like frankensteins monster, with its component parts ripped intact from older works and then sewed together to make a whole.
The surgery scene is initially tense, a bit discomforting, but then becomes utterly banal.
If so then that would explain Awake.
Just imagine you are being cut open like that and then listen to what he says.
Telling yourself "think about something else" and then forgetting your pain by just thinking about your girlfriend is just...stupid.
plus that "she knows the hospital" stuff... and then it takes her "one second" to figure it out?
That drunk doctor doesn't know anything else either...and then they bust them all, even the girlfriend???
The moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia, he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him.
The surgical scenes were laughable.... and surely they must know that people who have a little knowledge of medicine would find this utterly absurd......Anesthesiologists do not leave the room during a heart transplant....nor do they do the surgery in a tiny room devoid of instruments, heart lung equipment and sterile techniques... just a joke... couldn't concentrate on the story line because of all the stupid surgery scenes... no blood, no personnel and then the hero doc coming in and taking over... it is not a film for thinking adults....Also the budget must have been limited... the street scenes were OK but who was the technical adviser....Seems like it was directed by a total idiot.. Save your money and wait until it comes out on DVD and Don't rent it..
But then he sends himself back in time (yeah, likely) and saves the day and the girl (not to mention himself).
There are long scenes of bad dialog where a point is made, then repeated over and over and over and over for ten minutes.
If you can't make a realistic looking crime scene (at least have SOME POLICE and police tape is cheap), then don't have it at all.
They go on and on with him trying to get it unstuck, finally cutting his coat loose, then trying to even the coat up - yawn, yawn, yawn.
In this movie you have characters running around Europe trying to get laid for half the movie and then the rest of it is a shameless imitation of 'Saw' but without any resemblance of a storyline.
Young males who are horny find beautiful females and then are punished in a horrible way.
Their favorite victims are children, then young women, then men, because this is the easiest order to get control over.
Well then they are f**king idiots if they think so.
But when she takes a look at her reflection and then throws herself in front of a train in very dramatic fashion I become upset.
The movie was slow in getting started and then the sprinted to a singularly boggling ending.
If your expectations are low enough, and your tastes in gore sufficiently robust, then you are in for a good time.
The man that killed his friends just happens to be on the train on the way home so he can kill him and somehow not get blood on himself, then continue on his way.
None of the other characters really gets enough development for you to care about them, save that of Buck (played by a then unknown Robert Englund).
Though, as expected, the film incorporates gratuitous nudity by a variety of girls into its narrative, the best scenes involve Finley and Burns' little daughter being pursued within an inch of her life by Brand Â who then unleashes the crocodile (which doesn't look that good, or even that much) on her!
Perhaps it's the stagebound production, but then perhaps it's just the crummy screenplay...
Afterwards, the only way to try to make the wasted 87 minutes seem worthwhile was to then lend the film to some TCM loving friends and inflict it on them too.
So, if you are looking for a useless cheesy movie about some guy who wants to take the world over with head exploding rap music (no I did not make that up) then rent this movie right away.
This movie is worse then bad, it`s boring.
Then they drink half a bottle of wine between then out of picnic cups.
and then it ended.
If you do anything at all this Thanksgiving weekend, then by all means, put going to see "Deja Vu" on your shopping list.
Let's recap, he's been shot down by Perky Meg Ryan, fallen off of a building, ridiculed by construction workers, and then mugged of everything including his shoes by random guys.
Maybe these producers didn't even have enough money to buy their characters bras, but then couldn't she have gotten a non-see-through shirt?
There is some trick photography, but nothing new; in fact, these tricks (superimpositions, stop substitutions, a fish tank between characters and the camera to represent being under the sea, a tilted camera to make them appear to be going up and down stream) had been in use for near a decade or more even by then.
There doesn't seem to have been many movies back then which were so specifically targeted at children.
It's strange giving this movie those "attributes" ... but then again that's the disguise it does wear and tries to tick off every box there is ... but that doesn't really help ... not at all!
I am WAY tired of people making films that bash America and Americans and then send them over here to make money.
Also...somebody in this movie should have had her big fat Greek wedding and then hung it up.
I only gave it a 3 because Slaters performance was good enough,but i'm sorry to all Wes Bentley fans,as i get angry when people slag Slater,but this guy really can't act,the last 10 minutes of the film,he gets a pass from me,but up until then,he is like a lump of wood,again,i apologise for being negative about him,but in this movie,he deserves it.
Though bent on revenge, he has to crybaby breakdowns, then becomes "tough" shoveling dirt on a highway construction job (those guys don't look tough to me) and then comes up with a crazy plan to bury the bad guy in a hole in the highway.
The hero then tries to bury the car with one load of dirt, that he shovels in by hand, rather than using the front loader that he has available.
This spoof on Alias starts out funny then the stale joke gets quick fast.
These directors definitely did a good job editing and getting locations but if that's the best you can say about something then is it really worth mentioning to others?
The same thing that I'd forgotten bothered me then came back to bother me once more: I simply could not get past the fact that Franchot Tone's accent was never taken into account by the German characters in the story.
), but then her 17 year old son is a DIA operative in the company and her ex-husband is a DIA agent.
Bad guys in the company she works for are into selling secrets to foreign agents, so she reveals happenings about this and is fired for doing so, then is set up by insiders in the company to cover up the killing of the company president.
**SPOILERS AHEAD**  They plan a scam, goes fine, and then suddenly the bad guy henchman jumps at them out of nowhere.
We've then had another 11 (inc. Freddy vs Jason), plus this one, and they have just got worse each time.
Shoot, I know he didn't because he would've seen then there was, in his words, too much sex.
But overall, if this were the first Ft13 that someone ever saw, then this 're-imagining' has left them confused as to what Jason's mother actually did and why Jason does.
I thought it would be near impossible to make a bad Ft13, but all involved here have achieved that and then some.
Why would anyone take the story of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and then slap on the title of Friday the 13th????
Movies like this where a group of friends are on a road trip to nowhere and then something goes horribly wrong in this case crystal lake's Jason, are nothing new.
This oozed Marcus Nispel's other remake The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and he should have went with another set designer and filmed somewhere other then Texas.
If there are sequels to this reboot,then I will pass..
"Oh, uhm, I smoked several weed cigarettes and drank a couple brewskis, then passed out."
It was a badge of honor to be mugged in Times Square back then, when you'd have to beg for a token (!)
while putting in a lesbian scene and then getting sodomized by her now-assertive "protege".
Eventually, Clay finds Whitney, but by then Jason has appropriated his hockey mask, whittled down virtually nondescript nitwits, and bears down on the hero and heroine.
The film also stoops to presenting distressingly stereotypical characters, including blatantly adding the token black guy and the token Asian guy and then tries to poke fun at it!
Well OK then.
And then there's a missing sister, who I kept confusing with the rich jock's girlfriend toward the end.
If you can hire a black and an Asian actor to help diffuse all the shaggy-haired white boys, then why can't you hire an attractive black or Asian actress?
And then for some reason the survivor(s), another thing that was lame, decided to dump his body in the lake.
There are loads of other changes from the real events, but then Hollywood and the film industry has rarely cared about accuracy.
Not unlike every other professional environment then where people are sucked dry of imagination and creativity in order to generate more cash-flow.
As always, the carnage accumulating around the heroine doesn't seem to faze the cops who appear to wait for the next killing, show up, then calmly survey the damage and ponder why it just keeps happening around our female lead.
If you enjoy laughing over a miserable attempt to make a mystery, then by all means, rent this one, have some friends over, make popcorn, and have a cooler of beer on hand, and prepare to be entertained.
My 10 year old daughter could write a film better then this.
So then there is this Morgan Sinclaire character who goes about literally sucking up friends and enemies like some mad dust-buster (for what reason is unknown) and you would expect this personified evil to finally get what for, but what happens?
fail to find the final fragment before Sinclair, then Sinclair will wear his sunglasses a lot and have incredible powers with which to control the world.
Joan rationalizing with herself would have been much more believable then this.
The a-hole gets killed and then has the audacity to haunt the boy's father, (Lowe).
Reed never convinced me he was anything more then the Snowman with a gun waiting for Burt Reynolds.
I was one who picked up the book first and then went to the series.
OK first things first, everything just looked so fake, it was the most pointless movie i ever had to watch , there was barley any story line and the main character looked about 40 at the start anyway, then wen she got changed to look older .
u could hardly notice the difference, i watched this movie 4 times because i thought that there may be something to get that only i was not getting, on the final time i watched it with a friend and she was sat there like :S errrrr why are we watching this.. and then it dawned on me ... i really do not know why i would watch this once let alone four times.. this probably will not be useful but all I'm trying to say is.
As a Greek I have to say that if this is where Greek culture is heading, then Greek culture is in very serious trouble.
Webb is immensely touching in his attempted suicide, but then, I have trouble thinking of a bad Gloucester.
Not too long there's another accident and then another one.
The sincerity and that of moral judgment gets shoved down our throats with such brute force that I couldn't stop thinking this film had more on mind then churning out some monster goodness.
Damn, is he waiting for some sort of written invitation to get thoroughly involved, because he spends his time waiting about for something to happen then actually trying to prevent it.
Probably one gripe is that the lizard will rather watch and roam about more so then cause mayhem.
then throws it into his jeep and drives at top speed across a field.
One by one, it causes auto and train wrecks and then feasts on the inhabitants!
Lowest point of the film is when one of the town's leading idiots tries to sing a stupid song while pathetically twanging a ukulele, first for a crippled little girl, then for a group of moronic teenagers.
Maybe some people like such films Â but then these films should be described and labeled as such - this film is NOT a comedy - this film is boredom (or should we call it "boredy"?
The film's moral doesn't crystallize until the final scene - Gondo states a defense of his right to pursue his own happiness via an oblique reference to kids happily playing in a park below, then makes a dramatic and symbolic statement about the root meaning of outrageous taxation by slicing his finger and revealing to Ryoko his long-sought hidden bank account - via an account number scrawled in his very blood.
If Brigid had been played by a smarter, more seductive actress and the sexual relationship between her and Spade been alluded to, then the dark motivations of the story and Spade's character would be fully realized.
If you're very interested in the old Hells Angels (pre 60's) and think that smelling bad, looking bad, drinking and driving at the same time is cool then this film is most certainly for you.
If not, then you just might as well pass this one by as most other people thankfully will.
Especially as this killer penis rapes women, destroys their insides, and comes out through their mouths, behaving like a knife, eviscerating them and making them explode with blood, then scuttles across the desert like a cowboy hero out for revenge.
If you are going to do an historical film then you have to make the audience care by giving meaning to the lives of the people you are filming.
If you are film school student then this should serve as a great example of how NOT to make an historical drama.
And then it hit me, they must have shown them the preview first.
As was said before in another comment: no body in Anderson was interviewed, Ed did not run for Mayor, he had filed in the primary and then Saundra was found dead and he withdrew.
I wish someone would really investigate all the things surrounding Ed and then write a book.
She started off in uncredited parts in prestigious movies ("About Mrs. Leslie" (1954), "Rear Window" (1954)) and then landed leads in a few good "bad" films ("The She Creature" (1956), "Runaway Daughters" (1956)) - and then no more.
She then reads that "Woody", her old boyfriend, has escaped from jail in Omaha and realises that Al, the hardened boss, probably double crossed him.
The movie then changes entirely and Woody is not heard of again (very weird, as that seemed to be where the film was heading!!!)
Michael begins to suckle, then takes a big  ol' bite.
If your a fan of the Italian horror movies then you might like this movie.
If a woman is sensitized , and looking for sources, other than herself, sensitized to look for it in signs in her husband, then he takes the brunt of the hate which is in most cases conjured up in the minds of everyone, occasionally, man or women.
I could have watched the first 5 minutes of this movie, then left and come back for the last 3 minutes and not missed a thing.
If you liked 'Snatch', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', then you're in for a treat!
However, Stuck on You, the newest offering by the Farrelly Brothers, is none of those, for it tries to be offensive without being too offensive, because then some people would be offended.
If that makes you laugh, then more power to you, but I think most people require more.
If you can see past it then it's OK.
They are all then killed having failed to realise that attacking one at a time isn't a great long term strategy.
People, if every movie was that good, then those movies would not be considered great films.
However, if what you want is a low budget b-movie that's as tacky as fondue and makes you laugh out loud, then this is just your cup of tea.
And, then there's the mad professor who's totally lost the plot.
The movie takes a little too long to get to the new mutations, so none of the thrills really begin until then, but the action is exciting when it's there, most particularly in the final half-hour.
If a really ugly person could get hot women, then anyone could sleep with super models.
If you've read the other reviews then you know the focus: a self-involved film maker wants to introduce you to his sexual habits.
He's just thinking up naughty and then giving in.
I finally caught on when, with the third girl, he freelances all night, then comes home to Christa and kisses her and says he wants to try to kick the habit.
It's "Come watch me," then "Help me quit," then it's "Don't you go out and do this stuff because I'll get jealous."
His addiction is not so much to having sex with prostitutes, but to endlessly approaching them, pricing the act, and then saying "I'll have to think about it."
They are then lured to the ultimate treasure of Midas's hand by an oracle and they eventually have to decide what's really important(the treasure or the people).
Someone compared to "Happy Days",and I can see why:They were both sitcoms that take place 20 years before the current time they were broadcast,and they both offer only surface ,cliched depictions of the actual eras,not even close to the full scope of it,just showing the obvious things - the fashions,toys,music,contraptions,etc,and that's it.For those too young to remember,or weren't born then,trust me,the '70s weren't like that,any more than "Happy Days" were like the actual '50s,as "M*A*S*H*" didn't accurately portray life at a US Army medical base during the Korean War,etc.
But then, near the end Sarah's character tells Hilary that her friend falling was indeed and accident, leaving the viewer bewildered as to most of the antics the frat did in order to cover up the "accident".
Ally Sheedy, no less) and some bitchface blond Brit, and then have a whole movie's worth of lame nonsensical plot crammed into the last 10 minutes, then you'll end up building a little shrine to this movie somewhere in your humble abode.
It would be easy to say that this low budget thriller just doesn't work and then point out the obvious flaws but I think it's incredibly sad to watch any actor that is even remotely well known appearing in something so idiotic.
Once the storm passes they have a difficult time getting rid of him and then to Louise's horror she discovers that Lenny was the one that attacked her before!
When Penn is first introduced in the story he starts to meander and mutter about "being good on the eyes" and then starts to really babble like an idiot.
Sheedy's career had hit a high note in 1998 with the fascinating "High Art" and I thought she deserved an Oscar nod for her tough performance but ever since then she has slowly slid back down to crap like this.
Just then Lenny, Stephen Baldwin, the local clam digger gets swept up out of the ocean and dropped right into Lou's home.
What we don't know about Lenny is that he's anything but alone in his attempt to murder Lou and has a lot more help in doing it then we, the audience, and Lou may think.
Sheriff Deluca is also one of the major players in the plot to do in poor Lou.The ending of the movie was about as anti-climatic as you could make it with the only major actor in the film who, up to then, had nothing to do with the plot to murder and legally steal Lou's money ending up being the "mastermind" of this whole crazy and unbelievable scenario.
Mainly he just follows Maria around, trying to convince her to do things, and then he has a "Oh, yes, don't forget I'm gay" scene every so often.
I didn't hate it because it's not understandable...I hate it because it doesn't want to be understandable, and I've always thought that when you finish watching a movie then give it a lot of thinking to discover totally nothing about its own meaning or its special message, so this is the definition of a "Bad" movie !
And then they will go back to using nanotechnology to build robots that will automatically clean their rooms, do their homework, and stop their terminally uncool dad from ever mentioning the 70s again.
Apart from that, the message is clear and plain, but then, the rumors about the director's sexual orientation which was connected to this movie somehow bothered me.
But then I was proved wrong.
The film then shows a reporter (Joanna Lumley) talking to people who knew him best.
Again, if you need to see the whole series, then watch the film, but it is nowhere near any of its predecessors.
The final surviving footage of Peter Sellers is played, then there's this "Inspector Clouseau has gone missing" thing, which is played out not with a missing persons search but with a TV reporter preparing a special on him, doing some strangely irrelevent interviews with Panther stock characters.
But then it gets decidedly ridiculous, and after a while you feel very cheated - Edwards has booked bums on seats in theatres without giving us any kind of movie at all.
And then there was another Pink Panther movie after this.
Upon Sellers' death, UA offered the film (which was originally to be helmed by Sidney Poitier, then later Clive Donner) back to Edwards.
But then you see a sequence lifted wholesale from "Strikes Again" (Clouseau's mishap with a bag of groceries) and things go rapidly downhill.
Witness Dreyfus's barely concealed laughter during his attempt to eulogise his former nemesis...And then remember that he did the exact same thing in "Revenge"...
If movies where virtual reality characters come to life and they are all either male tough guys or female eye candy sounds good to you, then perhaps this movie may not be a total waste of film.
See, it's not just a movie, where these two screw five times and then they talk.
One man shoots the creature (not fatally), then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark.
One female camper puts on a slinky silk negligee before crawling into her sleeping bag, then barely escapes being dragged into the woods by the sasquatch, without getting her hair and make-up messed up.
But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of missteps made: For some reason, Quastel thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur within minutes of each other in real time so that instead we see a few lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on.
This "Disney Original" idea is a complete laugh - if this is considered original, then I'm Abraham Lincoln.
and what can you do or say (except fall in love with it on the spot and say "I love you," respectively associated, right there in the orchard of neon horror that is the movie rental place)--and then so imagine your heartbreak when you get home, undress it from its plastic case and discover to yourself the fact that it is completely: affectless, toneless, actionless, heartless, penniless, paceless, plotless, heartless, and, perhaps most horribly, humorless--you and your best bud cannot, for the glory that the world holds, come up with a single joke to combat the ceaseless waves of offense to your senses and sensibilities that this offers--not to mention devoid of a) evil and b)seeds of said evil...there are no effects: it features untold minutes of floral footage, which cause the actors to expire at completely surreal and random moments--with which occasional happening you can utterly sympathize...I went looking for a movie too bad to be believed, and I found it.
Most students are then quickly disappointed by the 2000 version.
If you like Wong Kar Wai then catch this.
it didn't start out to bad at the beginning since there were yakuzas acting sort of funny but then it went downhill from when the main characters went into the factory.
The plot sees Laurence killed in the first few seconds, and we then follow her husband (played by someone called Dean Winters) as the world around him is turned on its head.
You know, where you're watching for 10 minutes, the character wakes up, takes a couple steps forward, then wakes up again 10 minutes earlier.
It then tries to piece together the amensia of the main character through flashbacks, but these scenes never add up to any kind of plot/insight because yet again you don't know if the character is dreaming or if it really happened.
The Lament Configuration opens hell and you die, not you open the box then have a headache for an hour and half.
If you're one of those people that would give nonsense like this a 10/10, then I just feel sorry for you.
But then again, 90 minutes seems to be just the right time.
If you go, stay for those two minutes, then make a beeline for the exits!!!
Thumbs down to Brooks then, and better luck to Paz next time, I hope this mistake doesn't stop her rise to stardom.
But, then comes the discovery Capt.
Who said that one must have a screen play first and then add the images to make a film?
How about having visual images first and then thinking about what narrative can build out of the images?
It would probably be no different then Moral Orel.
However, It is more a satire on the people that make it rather then the people it is depicting.
Hey, I laughed at the Simpsons, then South Park, and now these other shows which Adult Swim has done, but the bashing is wearing thin.
For the most part it was incomprehensible with the plot careening one way and then the other.
This film contains serious contradictions, as it oscillates between making some characters appear sympathetic and then suddenly exposing them as baddies.
The story must have started out as a tough crime thriller and then some frustrated sentimentalist wrote the script and could not help himself, he just had to have some love scenes, and the fact that the characters were all wrong for this could not and would not deter him.
Perhaps DY decided to make a Western, then after finishing the script watch Sixth Sense and thought "WOW!
Basically, the whole thing is like a script someone threw in a blender, ground it up, then pasted it back together at random then made a movie.
I must admit that once we got to the point of the film where sheep are birthing their lambs that the film began to pique my interest, but by then, I really couldn't care less about the characters, and wanted it to end.
overall a great horror movie, with just enough suspense and gore to never get into the way of the story, at the beginning i thought, not a movie like Halloween 2 (great movie)again, were they just systematically wipe out some sort of hospital, but then she escapes and the story goes on and on, just good old story-telling like it should be.
I had high hopes for this movie and then spent the entire time just sort of getting through it.
If this was the case then why on earth is it such a lifeless, uneventful time.
Yet, after Boone finally kills the man, then someone raises a pistol and fires it--at which point the horses THEN take off!
But then, only a second later when Scott stops the wagon, the guy is splayed out--dead as a doornail!!
Later, in the big obligatory confrontation scene between Scott and the Baddie, Scott doesn't even squeeze the trigger and no shot is fired (no flame shooting out the gun, no smoke, no kick--nothing) and then Boone falls dead!!
On the other hand, if you blindly follow Hollywood players, or believe that purely by eliminating songs and putting in gorgeous imagery you automatically transcend all flaws of the typical feelbad-flick and will get to watch a better film, then this one is for you.
If it is aimed at first generation immigrants, then it would only scare them by preying on traditional fears of westernization.
If it is for an American population who want to understand the Indian mindset, then the complete lack of realism only serves to marginalize Indians with outdated images of false stereotypes.
Sherlock Bones is the heartwarming tale of a small boy, his potentially dangerous father, his veterinarian love interest (who wears a lab coat in the one scene of her working, for the next three scenes, and then never again in the entire movie), her incredibly badly acted miscreant child, a talking dog, and an entire cast and crew of people who make a series of misjudged decisions after another.
Drags on for about twenty minutes, and then the most incredible crew of drag queens, led by a terrible looking, punky Cheryl Ladd, invade the film with a coterie of the worst (somewhat) live actors, mechanical men and make up jobs the world has ever seen.
Kristofferson was OK for Kristofferson back then, Cheryl Ladd lost her acting chops for 108 minutes and she was much older looking than recently ("Permanent Midnight").
I was literally rolling in the aisles laughing ...and then crying... and then laughing again.
It's so bad that it's good ...and then bad again and then finally...after a long, long time (a millennium at least)... maybe good...?
The final suspense chase, when finally the truck driver shows up, and one cannibal is ran over, then Leatherface chases the girl, and the long awaited ending is near.
Sad then, really, that some of them have regressed only to parodying aspects of their personality in this.
At first, I thought this film was a comedy, then I realized they were trying to be serious.
In essence the movie has scene after scene that does nothing but emphasize and embellish hate over and over....someone gets out of line...BANG...someone spits the wrong way.....BANG.....someone talks out of line....BANG...then the end of the movie comes and guess what????
This NEVER could have happened in the TV series and in many ways makes the show irrelevant--after all, what's funny about moving to Hootersville and then leaving because it DID suck after all?!
Maybe then they could've used the money they'd have saved and spent it on better writers, because the next glaring mistake was the bad writing.
), and then the crooks are captured and put on a chain gang again(???).
If I understood this part correctly, then why would the government care?
But if you're able to use your brain, then you should be able to recognize "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" for the important work of art that it really is.
Midway through, it comes to life briefly, and then changes directions giving up everything it had going for it.
If you think this is how America truly is, then you're so naive.
First there was dragonball, then came DRAGONBALL Z which showed(I don't know if it was a first run or a rerun) in my country in 2000.
Stay away from this, even as a rental.I picked this up in Chinatown for five bucks on DVD and feel I was over charged (and ripped off since the DVD only had one set of 3-D glasses in it- then again the 3-D didn't always work) 3 out of 10.
To that extent, the show isn't just unfunny, it's actively offensive - but then, no one ever said conservatives could be funny.
She gets knocked on the head again and brought back to her normal("neuter") self and this happens to other characters as well but then she gets brought back by another knock which is kind of strange.
Waters then throws in everything imaginable and it stops being funny.
You kill a human being and then have the nerve to feel you're being wronged by the other members of his tribe because they want and expect retribution Â it's something my 21st Century sensibilities cannot comprehend.
The most horrifying thing is that she is not dead yet, sitting upright in shock but then hopelessly shoved back inside by Leatherface, who has now killed her would-be rescuer.
The thing is, TCM is a groundbreaking movie but few people back then noticed it.
I still say that the french translated version of the first is better then the original English version (both are good in their own ways)  Here tho we get a bad attempt from the dubbing company to recapture the magic of the original french translation but all we get is a badly translated movie.
However, if you do enjoy bad VD jokes, monotone Steven Baldwin acting and a storyline a kindergartner could poke holes into, then by all means rent "Slapshot 2: Breaking the Ice."
And then TCM starts rolling and picks up steam and never stops.
The chase scene where Leatherface hunts down Marilyn Burns, scared out of her wits and howling like a wounded animal, is shot through branches of trees, as if the landscape is conspiring to ensnare the victim and so hunter and hunted run in the fields and inside a house and then back outside while the titular chainsaw is buzzing away in a constant reminder of gruesome death.
I'm glad I didn't watch this little ditty in a cinema, because then I would be forced to walk out (which I hate doing).. What I hate the most about this movie is it's awkward pace - It's a mess, a collage of fast paced scenes mixed with slow motion shots.
If you honestly thought this movie was good, then God help us all.
I'd a rather Napier played him since Napier's role was mainly at the beginning and then the end as the crazed cop.
I'm saddened to see that a show that I watched from 1965-1992 and then started watching again when Steve and Matt and Mary Beth returned is still going to be so terrible.
Daniel MacIvor, you did your best and played your role with heart, for this I thank you...but then again you also wrote it, so I'm still upset.
What if Emerson punched back with gusto, held his own in a fistfight and then asked the question: "What is it you want?"
If you like intelligent films, then avoid this at all costs.
If you like mindless fluff, then there are still a hundred other pieces of mindless fluff you'd be better off watching than this rubbish.
I have heard so much about this movie, the interesting thing is, my mom told me it's one of the bloodiest movies she's ever seen, then she paused and said "Wait, actually there wasn't that much bloodÂ it's just creepy".
But then my friends came over and we wanted to watch a scary movie and they all saw that I had The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, we turned off the lights, turned on the surround sound and then the screams came as I realized this is one messed up movie!
The man speaks and acts bizarrely, and then slashes himself and Franklin with a straight razor before being forced from the group's van.
If you are a fan of Larry Adler, you will enjoy the soundtrack, but if you have an IQ higher than your shoe size then I don't think you'll miss this film.
It has some whiny junkie capturing Batman then proceeding to beat him, inject him with drugs, and rape him.
Unfortunately, these ideas are lost and muddled, because the film keeps switching teams; one minute it's about vigilantes being wrong, then the next minute they say the hero is needed; then the villain gets all of the sympathy, making you want to hate Batman, and then when it ends, they want you to sympathize with Batman.
The director seems focused on every type of taboo that could never make it into a studio superhero movie, such as having the hero tortured, sexually assaulted and then pointlessly killed with a heroin overdose.
The guy then spends the next 2 years on the street.
We're talking about a man who saw his parents killed right in front of him as a boy; got hell from all his trainers as he prepared to become Batman; saw a close friend's double personality destroy him; after failing save a girl from drowning, got addicted to a steroid pill for which he had to lock himself in the cave for a month to recover from it(hence the unbelievability of the heroin addiction part); had his second Robin brutally murdered; had another sidekick (Barbara Gordon) paralyzed at the hands of the Joker; saw his other best friend, Gordon, stripped naked, tortured, and tormented with pictures of his daughter, also stripped, just after she had been shot and paralyzed; after going a week with less than a day's sleep rounding up all of Arkhum's inmates after they had escaped, got his back busted by steroid-laced madman; saw his beloved city have its own Black Death from the "Clench" virus, then further carnage when it got leveled by a 7 point earthquake.
With all that, why would Batman give in after finding out he unintentionally sent an innocent man to the slammer, then sent into a heroin trip, and raped?
Hughes filmed some really great aviation footage and then worked to build a story around it, one with some sex.
So he re-shot and re-shot the aviation sequences and then eventually lost interest.
Jet Pilot was released seven years after it was originally filmed and by then the planes really looked out of date.
Why then would you have the shapely Janet Leigh filling out a flight suit after allegedly going off course and landing in the USA?
Air Force Colonel John Wayne interrogates Janet about the latest in Soviet technology, but then he gets other things on his mind.
I think what is still with me after this is the sense of fear and utter WEIRDNESS that emanates from the movie...  And it all seemed so realistic...no hokey fountains of blood, no running into the shower, or overused cliches, just a bunch of kids that need to get some gas, meet some very odd characters (The Hitchhiker is superb) and then fall into the wrong place at the wrong time...
Simply put, the best horror movie ever...if this doesn't scare you, then nothing will, sadly.  
She stinks, so the boys find a greasy hobo, Rudy, with amazing soccer skills to coach the team (that's exactly what I did when my baseball coach disappeared when I was a kid--and we then went on to win the world championship...really!).
Anybody who heard Jones was in the film and then went to see it was most likely not bored and wondering where he was until the ending.
I saw this movie and was impressed first only for one reason .The new concept of short term memory loss .But then later when I saw the original one Memento I was totally awestruck by how beautifully the screenplay was done ,you in fact live with the character ,which you can never feel for once in Ghajini .Well thats not the only flaw the whole brilliance and intelligence of Mememto is diminished in Ghajini .
Before I start I did watch this movie twice, i didn't like it at all when I saw for the first first then watched it watched it second, i did find it bit more funny then before.
After all, they'd struck gold - and then some - with WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT and DICK TRACY.
I had no inkling at the time that it had been based on a comic book, but I didn't care; I didn't read comic books then.
I didn't expect a masterpiece....but then I didn't expect to be left cold, either.
Pausing, she looked at the now turned off TV screen, then back to me and went on ...  "And then there's films such as this which are just garbage, plain and simple."
Mo was unremarkable, but then that's just how I remember him from the first book.
I haven seen a character come so totally out of the blue and then tag along for no apparent reason sense Jar Jar Binks crashed into Starwars, and Farid is almost as annoying.
If you like endless clichÃ©s, sheer stupidity, mindless threatening, poor editing, cardboard characters, skimping on the special effects, constant frowning & pouting and sheer boredom - then Inkheart is for you!
These women have not changed since high school and still have low self esteem and I can't believe he supports them and then tells these other women on other shows that acting like that is wrong.
More often then not it is the males cheating and in the who's the daddy segment usually the male wants nothing to do with the kid.
That is not always the case but more often then not it is.
And how are we supposed to know what people are saying, when almost everything that comes out of their mouths is a "beeped" swear word, and then when they don't get the result they wanted they run off crying on stage or get violent?
But then about 2001 or 2002 something changed Maury Povich probably saw his ratings drop to (I'm guessing) Jerry Springer (as around that time, Springer would have the camera men go to people's houses, I wonder why they stopped that?)
Now, if you're reading this then obviously you know something about The Maury Povich Show.
She then rants and raves until Maury is certain that the crowd is strictly behind her before he lets them hear what the man has to say on a one minute video clip.
The man calls her enough nasty names for the crowd to condemn him as an awful man and then Maury brings him out.
Now, this goes two ways: If the man is the father then the woman jumps up and begins to berate him and the crowd begins cheering and the male makes some bullshit comment about how he's gonna be a great father.
If the man is NOT the father, then the man gets up and begins dancing, while the woman has tears in her eyes and sprints backstage with Maury, the man, and the skank girlfriend close on her heels.
And if it is scripted, then Maury needs to fire that writing team of 3rd graders and hire the 7th graders.
And then a cannon shell blows up 2 of them.
Clingy, whiny, codependent, desperate, then violent and completely mentally unstable.
I'd try it for a while, and then go back to channel hopping.
The supporting cast are a lot of then unknowns who later went on to more visible careers.
Of course then you couldn't have matching DVD covers.
If you haven't seen the original 1960 film, or read Whyndham's 'The Midwhich Cuckoos', then you might possibly like Carpenter's remake.
If you've seen the original film then avoid this one, especially if you have read Whyndam's novel too, you will only come away from the experience with a sense of disappointment and feel cheated of the time you invested in watching it.
Throughout the entire movie I kept thinking that it reminded me of another project, but couldn't put my finger on it...and then it dawned on me that the whole thing has the feel of a 1950s TV Western...it especially reminded me of the way the first season of "The Rifleman" was shot.
But then there are the weaknesses.
I feel the same way about this film as I did back then: it's craptacular!
But then the plot just droops off into a depressingly boring cesspool of garbage.
So if being a total waste was the most they could accomplish on their off hours, then they are truly unworthy.
But then, there are in every walk of life, every occupation.
She leaves anyway; then, her handlers give chase, forcing the star to hide out with William Wright (as Ward), a traveling newspaperman.
Miller's character seems much too busy to have a social life, but then we suddenly discover she's been promised to a man named Walter W. Walter, II.
The trade disuputes between japan and china going to the WTO(GATT or whatever it was called then) and about 10 years of the US hating on Japan for having an export heavy trade balance.
Both sides wanted to show that if peace was not accepted on their terms, then the future terms would be worse.
and then when you try to remember it later you can't.
Sure, the Eastwest "pan and scan" person probably was asleep when this cropping atrocity was perpetrated, but that doesn't explain the poor dubbing, poor acting, poor plotting, silly exploration of the landlady's attic by first a cigarette lighter and then a struck match (what DID happen to Julie's landlady, and, more importantly, WHY?
What is an endless fascination to me is these movies are usually starring some actors who had at one time some momentum in their careers but then fell flat.
Every now and then, a story emerges from Hollywood which affixes itself squarely on the pages of history.
The terrorists soon garner pity and then sad looks of disgust as one by one they are devoured and reduced to small piles of stained leaves and shoes.
Lorenzo Lamas is queer to begin with, then you add sorry effects and a lame story line and you have for a cocktail of queerness all around.
The ending stinks   the actors stink  i would rather eat my own vomit then watch this movie again.
One of two things always happens: Either they get sick of being shot at, and they gang tackle the victim and then some animated blood spurts around; or a poorly done CGI red blotch appears on the poor confused Raptor and it drops over in a heap, never losing that silly grin they always seem to have.
When the raptors got shot, I was reminded of horribly crude video game violence and paintball combined, and then their wounds magically disappeared.
it don't make sense i mean I've seen some goofy special effect tricks in my day but this has to be 1 of the worst ones I've ever seen man its just stupid i mean even i could tell it was fake when i saw the first Raptor man i mean i know all effects is fake but when u can even tell its fake first off then ya thats bad  another thing that i laughed about this movie is wat one of the other guys said about SEALS pose to be a crack shot and then in this movie they don't even aim at nothing and half the rounds they fire r misses man ?
...but then what is?
Most lighting looks like a spotlight in a dim room, and many of the scenes involve a deep, subterranean cavern -- which you'd then expect to be poorly lit, but had lights coming from all sorts of random angles.
Also, whenever a raptor is shot, red gas comes out of the hole, then a bit of blood drips out.
other then that the film was still one of the worst films I ever saw Sci-Fi channel produce, (and they have made some bad ones).
The raptors were funny to watch simply because when ever they would get hit with a bullet it would make a really unrealistic blood splat and then just disappear without a bullet hole or any mark at all.
The SEALS get the CIA person back, but by then they've discovered that the island is overrun by raptors.
A terrorist can be crouched behind a small tree as a soldier walks by, then the camera pans down and you see the terrorist, and realize there's no possible way that the soldier could have not noticed him.
However, the cast is much more interesting, mainly because we don't have the outstanding character actors now that we had then.
I was ready to walk out then but decided to stick with it.
I am sorry but if people think that unless a film is set in the current day people won't be interested in it then we are letting ourselves sadly down.
If this was an attempt to enter the market the Potter and Narnia series have created then it is very poorly done.
Will is driven by self-pity and only gets interested in the battle when he finds he has real power -- and then he becomes a rather self-righteous little jerk.
I can then claim my money back and clear the way for everyone else to get theirs back too.
Even if you had read the book, it appeared that the screenwriter was taking scenes from Harry Potter, scenes from the Fifth Element, and a few scenes from Cooper's original novels then patching them together.
If you have been a fan of Susan Cooper's beloved book series since you were a kid, saw the preview and thought "Maybe it won't be as bad as it seems...", then I weep for your broken childhood love.
If you were like me and thought "Even if it is cheesy, it might turn out to be fun", then I'm giving you a Get Out Of Jail Free card with this review.
If after The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Narnia, and Harry Potter, the bigwigs in the studios think that this sort of thing can pass as acceptable, then the legacy of Story is over already.
The first 20 minutes or so have hope and the promise of wonder, then the movie just kind of craps out and loses interest in itself.
All we get with Will is someone who discovers he has the power to change the world, and says "that's nice", then walks away.
This movie is propaganda that doesn't admit that it is such, but then, propaganda always cloaks itself.
I can only join most good folks round here in saying to you: Distrust this movie, watch it, but then watch the truth, namely "Freedom Downtime".
although i then found out the truth about the Kevin Mitchnick story.
You'll then have some idea of what Pork Chop Hill is all about.
What bullshit, big brother sees you and then some more.
If you want to watch a well-made and fun film about hacking, then watch "Wargames".
If you want to know the truth about what happened to Kevin Mitnuk then watch "Freedom Downtime".
Coincidentally, this same movie was edited a bit, then changed to "made for TV" under the title "Savage Journey."
Other then that, you have to look somewhere else to find out about the Mormons.
But then, completely out of the blue, the cameraman accidentally witnesses a political execution in the middle of nowhere and suddenly the Americans have to flee from local crime-networks instead of from Gustave.
It follows the formula exactly, one tough protagonist, one hot female interest and then your token comic relief character.
then they goto Africa because there is a crocodile thats been killing people for like 60 years.
(i guess they realized they couldn't make a 'good movie' with just a crocodile so they needed more crap) then the crocodile kills a baby.
anyway then they set up the trap that never works and of course it doesn't cuz the crocodile like knows to knock out the cameras and flip the cage.
then we left cuz we couldn't take it anymore; the only reason why we stayed that long was because we thought the chick was going to get naked (i found out she didn't).
We do get the Croc and when it was on screen it was a bad sucker unfortunately they opted for more CGI then you could shake a stick at but it was not of "The Mummy/Mummy Returns" crappiness so I guess we can let it slide to a point but would a prosthetic monster Croc be too much to ask for in some of the scenes as it would have been more effective.
It then proceeds to be a typical creature feature with some decent gore and terror, but the political agenda brought up subtly in the beginning resurfaces and the film becomes mismatched.
It's like a boring, slow movie "action" movie in Africa...then a crocodile just pops up occasionally and brutally kills off someone and gets in the middle of it.
Mr Min Byung-chun, if you don't have any good ideas for a movie then leave it be but don't torture audiences with a horrible rip-off of good movies!
The movie makes more sense in the last third, becoming a relatively straightforward action picture, but by then you're trapped in a movie with characters you don't care about making everything that happens feel trivial.
Except for Jack Elam in one of his very first screen roles; he actually was a rather good looking guy back then.
On the contrary, Robert Mitchum, who was also arrested, came back to resume a hotter then ever film career.
After I had finished DBZ I heard about DBGT and I was so happy that they continued after with DBGT, I then watched the first episode of DBGT...
I loved Goku as a kid back in the day but that was then, this is now.
I mean I understand that's how they figured they could bring back Goku's tail which meant he could go Super Sayian and be monkey, which turned him Super Sayian 4 but then why doesn't he return a kid at Super Sayian 4?
While Gohan had always been pretty weak in DBZ, Goten could have been greater then Goku but of course, Goku can never be beaten.
The quick answer is sexploitation, of course, but then why not just pile on the sex, instead of complicating it with (a) a noir cliche like the crusading public servant falling into moral dissolution, (b) the enigmatic Christoid character from another plane of reality, whose name, Sam Silver, is a takeoff on the director's name?
If a 'zero' out of ten could be given, then it should only be reserved for this film only.
If watching a countless young madams prancing around whimsically on screen, fresh out of acting school (and I mean fresh), then this is your cup of tea.
However since no-one likes that, then this film is not suited to anyone.
What she DOES do is storm over to her friends, demand why they aren't wearing costumes like hers as they agreed, then deems their excuses as inadequate and runs out of the place, knocking over drinks and plates of biscuits and people along the way.
She then goes running through the streets, still dressed as a stuffed olive.
And then Jaz comes up to her and hugs her as if nothing ever happened between them, forcing me to conclude that an entire chapter was cut out of the film for pace reasons.
They then hatch a ridiculous plan to try and win them over, featuring cats and all sorts.
The film, to me, seemed to be a very poor attempt at a 'romantic comedy', where everything for the main character goes horribly wrong, and then a very unrealistic see's all her dreams come true.
However, the opinion I have given is one that I would expect from a teenage boy, and I believe that the film would be a one enjoyed by most girls; most of the girls I know have enjoyed it and therefore I would recommend this film to girls, but if it's with a boyfriend, then i'm afraid I feel quite sorry for him.
For reasons I fail to comprehend, "The Garden" then turns into a confusing and painfully dull mess that eventually reverts to annoying clichÃ©s and predictable plot twists.
Now,I'm 14 so I haven't seen many good mondos in my life.But,this is by far one of the best mondos I've seen yet.Traces of Death and Faces of Death are similar,but have one thing different.In FOD,the narrator explains what is going on,whereas the narrator in TOD,doesn't say much.Also,Faces of Death has about 85% of the footage faked.From what I hear about this movie in particular is that most or all of this is real.My problem with these types of movies is if they are real or not.This looks more realistic then Faces of Death.
However, if your after a serious documentary, then don't bother with this.
If your idea of a good time is watching a silent video taped sex change operation, I guess this is for you then.
Amongst some of the worst and most vile clips seen in the film include the actual on-air news footage of a disgruntled husband shooting his news reporter wife to death live on Spanish television; a helpless and innocent pig who get's literally roasted to death in a slow and unbelievably sadistic fashion via a blow torch by a group of scientists obviously doing what would be considered now (and even back then) illegal animal experimentation; and a really gross and totally uncensored male-to-female sex-change operation that goes above and beyond anything you might have otherwise seen on TLC's infamous surgery shows!
I only wanted to watch this film because I'd read that Kim Cattrall got her tits out...and then I had to wait over an hour for that.
Well, I saw this "vehicle"but then the MST3K version........and even Crow/Tom and Joel could not change my constant wondering; how the hell is this "thing"made possible??????!
The only saving grace of the movie was Rimi Sen who was fresh out from Dhoom then.
If you haven't watched 'There's Something About Marry' then you might enjoy this lame movie .... Lame because every joke is lifted directly off 'Something About Marry'.
AWARA PAAGAL DEEWANA was a hit at the BO so The makers decided to make DEEWANE HUYE PAAGAL, and with the now famous Akshay's comic timing there decided to make a copy of THERE's SOMETHING ABOUT MARY  Took Suneil, Paresh added Shahid, Rimii Sen  Made a commercial comedy film  The narrator act of Viveik that starts the film drowns it first only, luckily the film gets interesting with Akshay's entrance and then a few jokes are nice but then we have so many stupid scenes  A boring leading lady whom i doubt any guy of her age will also fall for Sorry Rimii, But why did the director choose her for the role that required someone damn hot and beautiful to explain people like Asrani falling for Budget constraints?
If the movie or TV industry cannot make a religious movie without showing the messengers of God having teenage puberty sex outside of marriage, then they should not make any religious movie, because they do not know how to make a religious movie.
If it was acting then that is impressive!
I started watching this after seeing footage of devastation in the film's first 25 minutes thinking there's going to more, even it if was CGI or old archive stuff there would be more chaos--BUT I got instead was boring by the numbers human dramaÂHey this is not the Hallmark Channel; I was baited and then the emphasis of the movie switched--and I am still livid over it!
I can't imagine any self-respecting talent not weighing in on how to make this story better, but then how could anyone have saved this cinematic disaster.
Basically, this film is full of subplots not fully explored and then ends very abruptly.
What I don't get is the fact that the script then has the cast sitting around whining, BSing, cracking jokes, whispering sweet nothings, while the clock counts down toward the end of the world.
In between you got a real lame take on the Halloween/Friday the 13th theme with a masked tall killer stalking victims and then killing some.
(I guess that's better then jokes that don't make you laugh at all) Along with Blank Check and The Pagemaster this movie seems to have fallen into obscurity and I doubt it will be remembered during the 00s.
To sum it all up if your'e at a loose end and can't get out and about for some reason then do rent this fella.
When the deputy approaches the car, Rudy jumps out and guns him down, then ices his partner, and commandeers the sheriff's cruiser.
Aged acolyte George Parkman (Max Jacobs) intends to prolong his powers for another thirteen years by taking the life of his virginal grand-daughter Alex (Christine Moore), and then wrest control of the cult from sinister leader Thomas Seaton (William Beckwith); but with Alex's boyfriend Bill King (Tim Gail) becoming increasingly suspicious of George, will the old man's wicked plans succeed?
I just found myself gazing at her legs more than paying attention to the dialogue but then that's probably always going to the case when it comes to Melissa Bacelar.
Dude seems to knock out the handyman until the handyman teleports behind the dude and stabs him dead, then proceeds to kidnap the blond who offered no help during the scuffle.
The result is a kind of boredom that comes from a film that seems to have been made more for the money then it was for the love or need to make it.
More dull then anything else it never generates enough interest to create any real scares because you really don't care.
Meanwhile, the leader of the cult engaged a convicted killer to randomly kidnap the granddaughter's best friends and then Â finally Â there's also a sub plot about a devoted nun going undercover in the cult by order of the Catholic Church.
Sitting through this felt like more of the same with some lame plot being given and then surprise, the dolls kill somebody!
And then the way he zaps the scientist...
Now I have seen ALL of the Puppet Master movies and besides the first and third episodes the rest were pretty much crap.It's interesting however to see the Puppets start out as evil slayers for their master Andre Toulon, but then become more as heroes fighting evil in the 3rd & 4th movies.
If you like strange then this film is for you.
THE PLOT: Leif Garrett plays a 12 year old kid who gets to witness his parents being raped and murdered by Van Cleef's motley bunch of misfits and then spends 40 days and 40 nights in the wild taunting and killing them by such tactics as the poisonous snake in the old saddlebag trick (it's not a rattler but some kind of middle eastern Adder variety, and how the kid gets it into the saddlebags is left to the imagination), the old scorpion in the cowboy boots trick, and other imaginative methods of execution that don't really involve having the kid kill anyone.
Eventually there is a big showdown, and if you've ever seen one Western before you'll be able to predict how it ends up, except that by then we have established a sympathy bond with Van Cleef, who never allows himself to really be as scummy as his gang and insists on being protective + helpful to Garrett's kidnapped, jailbaitish sister, and doesn't jump her pretty bones because he has a little bambino back at home who loves his poppa.
He leads a bunch of bandits who rape and kill the mom and dad of young Leif Garrett and then kidnap his sister.
It's as if the producers of Laugh-In sat down and decided to write a full length film, covering all the high points (and more) of the issues between the flower children and the establishment, then put it in the hands of a couple of hippies and gave them about a $10,000 budget to complete it.
If you ever wanted to play a game in which even an innocent dog is hypnotised by Jacko into dancing Thriller then this is for you.
In 1950 he makes Chain Lightening but then makes In a Lonely Place.
In 1951 it's Sirocco and then The African Queen.
In 1953 it's Battle Circle and then Beat the Devil (maybe a confusing failure, but not hackwork).
From time to time, it looks like there was no script for a scene, just "the characters argue about something, then stop."
Even the main villaness refusing to wear clothing other then a loincloth is pretty boring as she pretty much has a chest of a young boy.Mildly amusing in it's ineptitude at best and severely retarded at it's worst.
He then is able to shoot Ocron from a kilometre away using its shoot through rock capacity.
The subject matter is very interesting, but to me the director tried to look at different aspects of the film, and then bring everything together at the end.
Unfortunately the script then immediately reverts to all the known and dreadful clichÃ©s of the genre, as a bunch of insufferable teenagers decide to spend the night in the dark ride where the girls died more than 15 years ago.
If horror films were graded on a curve and categorized into five year intervals, then I would say Dark Ride was average in comparison to what we've been getting out of Hollywood.
Of course, this is hardly a legitimate reason to score a lousy film higher then it deserves, but it doesn't hurt.
The budget of "Dark Ride" was obviously low but not THAT low; they got the universal back-lot and locations at the Santa Monica Pier and the dark ride itself is really pretty cool--even though technically it doesn't look like a "ride" at all--the tracks disappeared early on and never returned, technically the "ride" is a walk through then...isn't it?
How else can one explain our "heroine" suddenly stopping and declaring she would find the others, but then abandon her friend and return to a simpering useless twit again.
Surprise who else is a killer, but then lets the girl go after she killed his brother, and after he killed a guy for facing his brother?!
It seems that they tried to give it a campy look "a la Texas Chainsaw" putting a group of young kids driving in an old Van, then picking up a hitchhiker... only to be slaughtered as the movie goes into its "dark ride".
But that was then.
If their confinement was actually impregnable after the cast exhausted all options of getting out, then the terror would have been present.
They should not have touted that these films were too much or "too graphic" for most audiences -- if that were the case then these would all be NC-17.
I thought at first I just had a dud.I wasn't able to get a refund only an exchange for the same stupid movie, and the next factory sealed one also skipped in the same exact spot so obviously the master copy is bad and has been transfered to all of the discs.I won't buy or rent anything again by this no-name new filmmaker and hope other's don't make the same mistake unless you like bad quality, grainy B-rated films made by a guy and his friends with a cheap hand held video camera.It is nothing more then someone's student film.All the money was spent on deceiving us with interesting looking cover art and a nice animated main menu.This is the only reason I even gave the movie a 2 out of 10.That is all this movie has going for it.It's a shame because I wanted to like this film but could never sit through it again.Now i've lost 14 bucks that could have been spent on something else.I feel ripped off!
The Trip starts as eight college friends begin a trip from Los Angeles to Arizona for reasons which aren't important, up front in the sports car it's Carl (Larry Bagby) & his girlfriend Devan (Courtney Cole) along with Garry (Michael Chamberlain) & his stash of ecstasy that they plan on selling, then in the off roader it's Devan's sister Cess (Heather Shrake) along with Dana (Elizabeth Keller) & Darius (David Slocum) while in the piece of crap run down car it's Sylvia & Veronica (Cristal Gerrick).
The three cars travel across the long winding roads & encounter a dirty blue truck which Carl gets involved in a road rage incident with which turns out to be a bad idea since the driver of the truck then decides to go after the friends & kill them one-by-one...
If this movie was on HBO 3 or something and you have time to kill waiting for the paint to dry in your bedroom, then this is a great movie to sit down and watch!
If this guy can make a living out of it, then ANYONE can.
there was nothing good about this movie nothing  nothing  if i could give it negative stars i would  if i was missing some sort of underlying "purposely-awful-movie-for-the-sake-of-irony" vibe  then i might understand more  some scenes attempt introspective depth and just come off as being cheesy  the humor is interspersed in a sporadic low-brow way  the impression it gives me is that the author only respects artists who are good at realism before they paint abstract things  the movie gives off an alienating attitude and shallow view of the subject filmed  the characters are mediocre at best  it's too bad cause ghost world wasn't that bad
After ogling love interest, Sophia Myles, from across the room and then briefly meeting her, Jerome starts calling her his girlfriend.
There were glimmers of freshness at the start, but then the staleness took over and even efforts to view it as dry self-parody were met with cricket chirps.
Many times through out the film she is found in exactly the same situation...just seconds away from transforming...but then she takes that drug and everything goes back to normal.
These are the same people who think that if anything is weird or doesn't make sense, then it has some deeper meaning that they're missing, so they better pretend to see it so that they look smart.
The movie then played.
She does admittedly suffer one major breakdown, but then recovers with remarkable celerity.
His wife goes off on a hike in terrain so rough that a guide is required, but then we see her at a perfectly accessible campsite wearing walking shorts and a flannel shirt, not to mention the platoon of policemen clad only in uniform following Pigeon up the trail.
Close Encounters so clearly wants to amaze and enrapture us, but it forgets that you do that best by engaging us with actual characters, making us care about them, and then leading them through a fantastic trip or quest where they find some kind of meaning.
If that's your idea of a good time, then be my guest.
Neary is an electrician who experiences a "close encounter" one night when a UFO seems to attack his car, and then flies off into the distance.
And then, and then, it happens....SPONTANEOUS CHOREOGRAPHED DANCING.
If you think being an "actress" is so glamorous and wonderful and challenging, then you'll like this movie.
After the clunky shooting scene, we see body doubles of the dead Vernon and Thorson and then the film concentrates on a bimbo who runs all over the place and who is eventually dispatched as well.
We see him here and there, in the jacuzzi or skidooing but then, after seemingly having disappeared from the movie, he reappears, dead in the jacuzzi, right after the moment Vernon and Thorson are shot.
It details how she runs from her life then she puts herself into another life.
She then marries again, while still married to her first husband, to the grounds keeper, Clancy Brown.
Being that there are three versions of this movie this surely must be the worst (I have seen the first but not the last but if it is worse than this then I will be avoiding it like the plague) .
If you are looking for a film of this type to watch as a family then do yourself a favour and watch 'Big'.
Ken leung is rather pathetic, he manages to "score" white chicks with stupid lines and then gets to act all superior towards them.
The acting was gone right after the directing and then the story, etc.
(The professor then scampers off camera without even waiting for Our Hero to say anything in response.)
The three daredevils then swear vengeance against 39013, and are hired by Granville to hunt him down, even though the impersonation is in effect.
If MY mother cheated on my father with countless men, then left my dad and literally drove him to madness and suicide - well, gee, I don't think I'd forgive her either!
Interestingly, in this entry, the policemen do not stand out and are more part of the woodwork then important characters.
The ending, where Ghost traps the transforming Brigitte in her cellar, and then welcomes her grandma home, is perfectly dark.
The comedians are funny when you do get to see them on stage, but most of the movie is spent looking at a "Raiders of the Lost Ark" map trace the trip across America, cut with footage of the tour bus and then an audience laughing.
If this is for children, then what's with the numerous crude jokes that are not appropriate for them?
Yeah, there are some likable characters in here and I would be lying if I didn't admit I laughed at a number of gags but I (along with two parents) was embarrassed showing this advertised "kids' film" to their children, only to hear Jesus's name used in vain twice within six minutes and then hear all kinds of sexual innuendos by the little girl in the movie.
This movie starts with a unoriginal plot but then quickly gets off the plot and tries to be too many things at once, putting another flaw on this extremely flawed movie.
But it seems they don't teach him how to tell right from wrong: first he attacks the burglars, but then he also attacks a policeman.
This is fine but then the plot begins and as you watch the movie you come to find out her killing seems to have nothing to do with the plot whatsoever.
Then he goes around (I think its him but then it could be his wife or the art critic- they throw her in as a possible murderess for no understandable reason)slashing up different people who have his art in order to take his paintings back!
Only in the surprisingly dynamic and exciting last third does this flick finally spring to life, but by then it's much too little way too late to compensate for the general tedium which preceded it.
If you're the type who believes that the world is a place of Black and White, Good and Evil, with zero shading between, then you may be able to stomach this film.
If so, perhaps then this review may be judging the movie too harshly.
He spends the entire time he's in the film smiling, joking and running around, flirting with Josie, he's depressed for thirty seconds, there's a 'tense' moment and then he kills himself.
It happened a good 99% of the time, where both contestants in each Trust Box round would state syrupy cases on why they should both vote Friend, then stand there giving each other unbearably fake and cheesy smiles, and then Kennedy reveals their choice and they both voted Foe and go away with nothing.
The music was good and much creepier then the story.
I hope that the comic was better written then the movie.
And then they reused Miss Argento's footage 15 or 20 times at the end(not that that is necessarily an altogether bad thing)I began to think that they really only shot like 8 scenes for this movie then edited them together repeatedly.
But then, without adding excessive spoilers, there is a terrible betrayal, everything goes wrong, and they wind up on the lam, with X hiding out at the New Rose Hotel.
There's nothing like taking a 60-minute movie and then turning it into a 90-minute movie by replaying clips from the first 60 minutes for half an hour.
It will be on TV again in a few months I suspect, and I also expect that I'll catch a few minutes of it then, if I can.
The plot A meteor hit a place and then two gangs come to the same place and go to warn and then the people who should have died are backing attacking the humans.
Yes folks, if you buy this trash then you have been well and truly stitched up, as the only way it resembles Danny Boyle's original and its sequel is the final two words of the title.
From the same novel as the later American version (circa 1993), movie purist agree this Europic is superior to the Hollywood product but then, aren't they all?
Take absolutely no notice of positive reviews or quotes made about this film to save yourself 100 minutes; even though you'll most probably give up on this film before the end, if you ever pluck up the courage to watch it as a frightful joke (and even then I'm concerned for your sanity).
But then there's the element that not all of us are familiar with.
The gory scene of the monster ripping Elizabeth's heart out is then followed by a laughable failure of the zombie-like Elizabeth running through the house in flames.
Despite the effect's this is unrealistic and whole house is a blaze in less then a minute!
He is taken aboard by Captain Robert Walton (Aidan Quinn) and begins to narrate his life, first as a youngster and then how he came to make his hideous creation.
This bit was enjoyable but unfortunately this short interlude of excitement lasted no more then 5 minutes and soon returned to it's dull but laughable self.
But plausibility is stretched to the limit by asking the audience to believe that such a foolish, emotionally labile man as Victor Frankenstein could actually have the ability to create life from death ... and then do it AGAIN?
Yes, it's a novel about creating life and playing God, but underneath that is a novel about both adolescent sexuality Â Young Victor, alone in his attic, fooling around with nature Â and also the consequences of creating a life and then not taking responsibility for it.
THe movie also lacks consistency and logic.SPOILERS How does a doctor who can bring a creature to life for the first time in human history study it for a matter of minutes before mistakingly thinking it is dead, and then just leaving the body hanging from his ceiling.
If it is meant to be a stylised "melodramatic" version of the novel, then by any standards of artistic taste it should be melodramatic, not a disastrously badly written hotch-potch of cinematic ideas.
If you are interested in jokes chewed over few times by the crew to be understood by the "masses", one liners from the Hungarian film and TV "elite" and no laughter at all, then by all means watch this terrible sit-com.
In one of the scenes, they show vampires as being invisible in the mirror and then they show the Joker's reflection after he turns into a vampire.
Most other movies, take an existing villain, add a new element which causes the Bat-Family (in this case Batman and Alfred) an enormous amount of grief, pain and suffering and then get rid of him.
Hitchcock normally puts you on a slow boil, then raises the temperature until by the end you're scorching and sticking to the bottom of the pot (maybe I took that analogy too far).
So if you're looking for a review that compares this with the anime, then just skip this.
In a nutshell it chronicles the four separate problems of angst filled 20 something's in four separate stories, and then tries to connect the stories together with a confusing, pretentious and pseudo-intellectual metaphor of an author writing a book.
The low-key nature of her not returning and the range of emotions from impatience to agitation to panic and then despair is performed with a realistic touch.
Now, if you got scared by looking at your own scary face, then you should watch this movie.
And if looking at your face made you laugh, then don't go for this movie, because it wont even make you laugh.
He chooses the worst crime he can think of (being a claustrophobic) and then plans it meticulously.
Nothing interesting happens in the first quarter of the movie then gorehounds get a good solid 10 minutes of splatter and gore then the story powers on to its conclusion with about as much intelligence as a lobotomised sheep and a plot thats about as interesting as watching your fingernails grow.
While trying to get you to know the man behind the mysterious disappearance of a Dutchman's girlfriend, some parts of the film drag on to no end, and then pick up finally after one specific scene, being a car-ride where it picks up and doesn't fail.
This slop belongs in the early 1900s where the stereotypical woman conned a man into getting them pregnant then guilted him into marrying her.
There are already too many hurt kids in this world who were born so their parents could have what they wanted, then decided they weren't what they wanted after all.
The humor is all slapstick-so Much slapstick-that I found annoying rather then funny.
If the man she trapped doesn't want a child and certainly DOES NOT WANT TO GET RID OF HIS BELOVED 16 YEAR OLD CAT, then he is made out to be the prince of darkness or a pathetic fool.
and then the whole thing goes to hell!
Unfortunately no one had the nerve to tell him it was a small role and he gives us his usual "lovable" foreign schmuck stereotype,shouting and waving his arms.His comical misuse of the word "Pussy" should have you rolling in the aisle.It has Tom Arnold in a rather bigger role.He too spends most of his time shouting and waving his arms in between "hilarious" attempts to kiss Hugh Grant.It also has Joan Cusack,a sort of madonna (with a small "m") figure worshipped for her fecundity.She too is very loud,her screams in labour are truly terrifying.And then there is Julianne Moore wafting through the movie half - heartedly,looking as though her mind is really on where she left her car keys.She is so disinterested she can barely be bothered to look at Hugh Grant,which is a sentiment I can at least have a certain sympathy for.
Mr Grant never gets into first gear let alone out of it in the less - than - taxing part of the posh English shrink with a practice in San Francisco and a reluctance to have children without long and serious consideration,a remarkably sensible attitude that renders him an object of contempt and ridicule in this movie.He stutters a lot and closes his eyes to express deep emotion,furrowing his brow then,in desperation, resorts to shouting and waving his arms like everybody else.
Un point then for "Neuf Mois",to give it the title of the French original,and,believe me,it struggled to reach that.
But then it does not deserve the relentless criticism.
But they also use nuclear weapons (an apparent evil) and are ultimately protected by radioactivity and then gold (the basis of our monetarist ways).
One moment you're together, and then you're not.
You feel nauseous and frustrated and then the fear settles in.
We observe as Raymond acts out his kidnapping scheme, and then pitifully attempts to bait young women into his car without any luck.
I'd be interested to know if the book is as bad as this, if its not, the scriptwriter needs taking out back and shooting, and then make sure they've got plenty of ammo, because they then need to hunt down every person that thought the script was good and worth filming.
But then I remember there aren't enough Scientologists to counter common sense.
If people are taking this as fact, then there is something wrong with them.
His obsession had taken him over, and since he was willing to risk it all to find out what happened to Saskia, then he had to lose it all.
And then exorcise your TV set.
Time and space are altered a bit; every now and then time will inexplicably slow down.
The version I watched was on the USA network and it was modified for teevee, so I may have missed some key plot elements that were cut from the original vision of its director, but then again I may have seen some really good Levitra adds in its place.
But then suddenly the standard IQ of these people goes sky-high: They understand atom bombs, know how to fly a Mig and work with highly cryptic computer interfaces.
What then happens it that we see the third person involved in her fate and this is why the film really gets under your skin.
there's a bunch of murders taking place around the area with a dude with some scissors and soon enough she gets attacked, but she gets away and then a whole bunch of zaniness begins!
and then the movie proceeds to go on for 10 minutes longer than it should describing what the hell happened in the rest of the movie.
Carl buries Frankie, makes an  incestuous pass at Ingrid, then disappears after Ingrid goes to the  sheriff.
To be precise, he is killed with the pick side of a two-headed ice axe, but even then, that's still not an ice pick, which is something entirely different.
If you get it into your head that the great Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky was in fact a boozy Welsh actor, then you might be able to sit through this mess.
i hated that radha Michelle, she frig-gin played him so bad and then left him for that other cheating mofo, it was like wtf that guy slapped her and was also a cheater.
If you're too lazy to handle subtitles, then you will miss out on excellent films like this and many, many others.
The scene where Morgan Freeman wanders into the stadium to see two people getting it on actually made me laugh out loud, then I realized the only way to watch this film is to treat is as a joke, laugh and make Mystery Science Theatre 3000 style comments and you will have a good time.
You can then decide if this movies suffers from: 1. a lack of music/score (I could have heard a pin drop at times), 2. trying to mish-mash multiple plot lines poorly, 3. not developing characters enough so we don't connect or relate, or 4. theme about the "mystery of love" is a very clichÃ© & tired concept.
The thing that irritated me even more then the gimmick mentioned above was the chronologically scattered framework that was used.
I heard the story was chronological at the premiere of the Toronto film festival and then they re-edited the whole film to create the flashbacks.
Altogether, if the series was released in around 1991-92 with the books most promoted then it would have been more understandable and rightly timed but still probably would have sucked the same.
And then you meet Raymond, the man who looks like an ordinary man with a seemingly happy family and, for no apparent reason, you realize he is responsible for Saskia disappearing from Rex's life.
If Uma Thurman can dig her way out of a grave then so can Frank.
Then we get a 3 minute chase scene, then revert to 30 more minutes of nothing.
First of all I am sorry for my poor English, I just want to say that the moral of this movie is just wrong, I would say stupid, the wife betrays her husband and he "cuckold" forgives her easily... No way, this is not real, so what is the moral then, I could not understand, I like Ben Affleck and enjoyed some parts of the movie where he says about his family and his father, these parts are good and makes people to think, moreover the movie is full of funny stories, however, the main idea and subject is totally wrong and this movie may cause some wives to betray their husbands, thinking their husbands will forgive them?!
First we experience the disappearance firsthand, and then we go into the mind and life of Raymond, showing how he coldly planned and carried out the kidnapping with as much emotion as changing the oil in his car.
Caught this during Showtime's free-view as the first of what (I hope) was an unintentional Ben Affleck Marathon, as this stinker was followed by another stinker (The Third Wheel), then one more for sh*ts and giggles (Reindeer Games).
But then there's other soldiers that keep exclaiming "Don't goggle me!".
And, after turning into a bad fighting machine that looks like he fell into a vat of flour while using the drug, he then insists on injecting others!
After taking a single injection of the serum himself, he then decides to woo Linda on a date, lays a big line on her about not wanting her "professional services" and simply wanting her company, and then he reveals that it was all because he wants her to allow him to inject her with the serum.
I hated this movie and if anyone wants to disagree with me and say its good then they're wrong and wasting their time.
Every now and then some breasts are bared to perk things up but a better script would have been more helpful.
Later, suddenly a daughter turns up, then a son, then another.
If pushed for a criticism, I would say that some of the symbolism seemed a bit too heavy handed but other then that, this is an intelligent, deep thriller.
It would of made for better padding of the movie then the junk they used.
This could, and to be fair, be down to a lack of proper funding, if so then the parodying of the major American beer companies and their logos that are seen in "KELLY'S Roadhouse" might be understandable.
All in all The Beast of Bray Road is a group of new family and old friends making movies, if it doesn't workout, then fine, lets make another.
If one should hit the jackpot and stir up peoples imaginations then all the better for them, but in the meantime The BeastÂwill remain an okay movie, but it will never walk down the road of being a good movie.
then you'll like this.
If you prefer the sort of horror movie that leaves that stuff to the imagination then you probably won't.
Of course, Curtis being a phony he seeks help himself, first from Stella Stevens' gypsy and then, deciding to fight fire with fire, Michael Ansara's medicine man.
WELL, then...what can I say about a movie I used to think was one of the coolest supernatural Indian thrillers I'd ever seen?
And of course, special effects that were considered "state-of-the-art" back then, look more than a little cheesy now.
Not that they sucked back then, but considering what's possible today....EHHH.
In classic fashion, if you can still find Graham Masterton's novel (which made the best-seller lists back then), when you read it you'll discover that what was great in print didn't necessarily come across that way on the big screen.
And then she gets to 'camp it up' at the end, with some visual effects that look like what George Lucas left on the cutting room floor while making STAR WARS.
Cracker was never as brilliant as House began, but then there's plenty of room for both sorts.
if you thought the first one was to dark, then you may have to watch this movie of an extended period of time  any wean this movie is amazing in every single way buy it NOW!
..He acts and copies Rajini's style, then copies Kamal's style .. then copies Vijay's style and then last but not least copies his dad's style.
Here's the plot: the kids collect some fleas, and then the fleas get loose at Martha Sleeper's posh wedding reception.
At the conclusion, when Lemmon smooched his "son" full on the mouth and then dropped his pants, the reaction shots (especially hers) were just plain sick.
Flav decided to bring NY back and then dumped her 3.
flav sleeps with these women and then eliminates them 9. why would these optimistic women want a 49 year old with 7 kids 10.the women act like they have no home training
If nothing else is on and you find yourself looking for 2 hours to kill on a made for TV movie then give it a chance.
Well, a friend of the owners does what we would now call a corporate take-over--and then he does a make-over on Betty and she becomes a big musical comedy star--but wait--it is more complicated than that!
anyhow all in all this movie is really bad, if you absolutely find NOTHING to watch or do then fine go ahead and give this one a shot, but beware of it's absolute ridicule plot and directing.
Download it for free, burn it to a CD -- then burn the CD.
Isn't just too contrived for Gene to switch to the ladies team and then throw himself on his sword?
It however then soon becomes obvious that this movie is turning into a romantic comedy.
And then they followed it up with a sequel, Urban Legends 2 : Final Cut which was absolutely awful but rather amusing at the same time, mainly due to the superb Loretta Devine who is always worth watching.
And then there are a bunch of seemingly important characters introduced during the first half of the film only to be forgotten during the second half, as if they never existed.
For example Git is shown getting into a fight early in the movie which ends with a bottle being smashed on a table then it cuts to a character telling Git how angry he is that a character has been maimed .
If no, then you might end up liking "Merchant of Death".
If you like Pare then it's worth a glance.
Brigitte seem to be haunted by her dead sister, who a was werewolf too and she will become too but she then takes a deadly second dose of monkshood, which would stop her of changing into werewolf.
Jeremy with her library books at her door and he see that she has taken drugs and then is about to take her to the hospital but is attacked.
she locked up and a little girls know about this and then helps her out to get more drugs to help her not to turn into a werewolf.
The acting is monotone for almost the entire production, even when a zombie is disemboweling some unfortunate victim and even then you can't even rely on the violence to carry this one.
We are introduced to the vague character of Dave, who unfortunately at this time, his kid (who looks roughly the same age as his wife) becomes stricken with Zombieitis, then gives it to his wife, who in turn must be shot by Dave, the only time in the film where Dave's acting is above sub-sub-SUB-par.
Derek, constantly giving members of the party the one fingered salute, eventually is kicked out, then returns, then leaves on his own will, returns again, shoots a woman in the stomach so the ridiculously slow and idiotic zombies can feast on her, and is finally strung up to a tree whilst the group takes turns punching him in the balls (while zombies surround them) That's pretty much the basic plot line for this excuse of a movie.
If I knew all you have to do is run around with a camcorder, act retarded,and make a deceiving front cover for the DVD, then i guess i can start making movies too.
The actors are like talking stone walls, until the script says "move," and then, they promptly become stone walls again.
I've seen amateurs in high school do a much better job then what these guys attempted in "Zombie Night."
Editing and plot are terrible; all of a sudden you might be thrown into a mass zombie attack which lasts 2 seconds, then everyone is safe and sound again talking about how dangerous everything was.
In some scenes there are 5 or 6 people making plans, and then the next scene the have added about 10 to 15 more people to their group.
Anyway, I guess if you like a little more "frights" you should see this, if not then I highly do not recommend this to you.
But then again, I completely HATED the first one.
Because with all of these so called scientist, experts working on how to kill them you would think the solution would be harder then taking a trip to your local Home Depot.
This is getting better then that classic movie Frogs.
The only 2 good scenes were when the character Micah is possessed, he gets zapped and then he's falling through a strange shaft, gets his body dismantled, he who walks behind the rows enters his blood, and he gets pieced to together and falls out into the cornfield.
Of course this film is corny because it is all about corn Thought that there were only one or two good scenes for example micah (bollman) is in Church and has a wooden doll and knife there is someone sitting across from him then micah starts putting the knife up the doll's nose and the guy across from him nose starts to bleed then micah keeps on doing it until the guy dies and the other good part is when micah dies.
I mean the Freddy films became a bit silly, humorous, comic book and people still enjoyed them (I know I'm one of them) But the fact of the matter is, if your looking for a serious, creepy, dark horror film then your best bet is to stay away from this horrid sequel.
And if you're not going to have at least one good girl/girl moment then WHY bother with a women-in-prison setting in the first place?
Seriously... if you have "Mein Kampf" or the communist manifesto - sit down and go through them rather then wasting time on this movie!!!
When his boss Maddy Rierdon discovers this she insists that the Locusts be destroyed but unfortunately a few of them escape and due to their massive re population powers they intensify to a deadly swarm that will within days eviscerate the entire crops of the United States...and then I assume settle in Hawaii for a vacation...sorry....Now Maddy together with her estranged boyfriend, and the scientist who created them must figure out a way to stop these locusts or save the countries crops from their destruction.
He shows no emotion or depth but then no one does.
if you want to see a film that is really bad then see this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The acting is wooden beyond belief, but then - there is a very little for the actors (well, I call them actors ...) to work on.
One of them plays a mentally handicapped person and if you can't tell which one it is, then I think that says something about each of their acting abilities.
And, what makes even less sense is that her plot is then so complicated!
If you don't know what it's like, then how on earth can you describe it?
1/10   By the way this film has inspired me though, if this junk can get distributed then surely i could get a film released too.
Starring, written, produced & directed by the aforementioned Len Kabasinski there are films which are so bad it's untrue, then there's the celluloid abomination that is Swamp Zombies.
I believe the writers of this film started off knowing that they wanted some boob shots and a "sex scene" at a cheerleader camp and then wrote a "horror" plot around it.
Throw in 2 playboy playmates (only 1 of which shows her "qualifications" for that position), an annoying fat guy who was adopted in real life by the camp handyman Buck Flower (probably the only reason 1 or the other is even in this film), a silent but creepy cook, an over eccentric counselor, a horny cop, and the film's choreographer (who plays the mascot of all characters), and you have a decent last gasp for breath in the by then dying slasher genre.
If you like bombs, or hate your self, then this for you, if not stay away...far away.
Back then he could hack into computers just like in mission impossible but cheaper and with sandwiches on them.
D'abo and A1 do the nasty (in an old hotel it appears) and they have a laugh about it, probably because they were rubbish and then luckily room service arrives and it's Meek.
This movie was basically a waste of time, but if you have 2 hours to kill and want something hard to follow to watch, then this is the movie for you.
He is trying to figure out what is going on around him and then comes this pretty lame explanation and a very strange ending to the movie.
Lucy chooses her projects based on things other then money.
All in all, I thought this was a good movie, and held up better then I thought it would.
If you find yourself with insomnia then watch this movie and you will sleep.
For some strange reason Mottran later drives a wooden stake through the dead lady's heart, like she were a vampire, and then drives back to Dolly's.
Wonderful - a story of illegal aliens who sneak into the US and then complain that they're not getting enough from their illegally held jobs.
What a pity then that he didn't sacrifice some of his lust for life by reading up on what makes a good story .
And then the girl gets owned by a cleaver.
Apparently it has a connection to a song or something, but then it doesn't?
And then she gets her head cut off because she was wearing gaudy jewelry.
If one can watch Christopher Walker doing his psycho thing for umpteenth time and can buy Steve Buscemi as ruthless hitman, then one might enjoy it.
What the movie is about is a bunch of old crooks, getting back together for one more job and it ends up going bad and then they are hunted down by the mobster who gave them the job.
If, as promised, this movie was restored then the results are simply horrible.
For some reason, every time Rover talks, their conversation takes a long pause, then they continue.
Sorry but this is a vent more then a comment.
If you are a depressed suburban kid under the false idea that your family hates you or that your mom's boyfriend is irresponsible for recovering from a drug addiction then I'm sure you would love this movie.
It truly does play like it was filmed from a script assembled by throwing the scripts from classic horror movies (and some that aren't so classic) up in the air and then picking up random pages after they fall.
It then sticks to that theme for the rest of the movie.
He then says that he can help them.
I found it hysterical at first because it seemed almost natural the way it was spoken, but then it becomes totally repetitive and soon falls apart when the killer finally shows up.
This movie isn't the way it's poster shows, and I assure you that if you don't consider my comment as a friendly warning then you'll feel very sorry after or even before finishing this movie.
If you can't make it look real then why bother to have one?
"Hotel CÃ¦sar" is, then, not to be recommended to anyone.
A very dangerous plan indeed, but the military isn't given the opportunity of coming up with laughably absurd ideas and then having them work.
He should have written a version of it get George Clooney and Julia back and get rid of Danny Trejo's character since he died in the first one and then he would of had a sequel worth seeing in the theater and not video or DVD.
His car breaks down on the road and he heads for the same club as the first film and of course is turned into a vampire and then comes back for his friends.
Buck is unaware of what is to happen when his friends take him to the bank and he finds out that maybe he'd rather just go to jail then be with these blood suckers.
The first film is so cool because the first half is a gangster film, and then it just changes into a vampire film.
It's basic movie trivia that you commit a crime and then you go to Mexico to escape the long arm of the law.
Only watch this film if you are a die hard Chow Yun Fat fan and even then you will be disappointed.
This movie is far from it and video stores should be ashamed as displaying this movie for anything other then it is.
And then I saw the movie...and I was wondering what all those other reviewers had been taking...
This is a movie to see once, then quickly forget about.
If you believe that film reflects who we are and are becoming and you linger on shock stories in the news then this movie and writer are for you!
My rule is if it's not a comedy and it's move funny than dramatic then it's not serving it's purpose.
and then tried to coast home on some pitifully thin technical excuse for a solution.
I decided to smoke a little reefer before then started to watch at first I was thinking to myself okay not the best but maybe it will get better.
On take off it is towed by a 4 engine Short Stirling, then its being towed by a twin engined DC3 Dakota (C47).
And then this supposed tale of British derring-do and their nemesis, an S.S. Major appointed by Adolf Hitler to steal priceless Dutch artworks and artifacts, comes unhinged.
And then of course there is a group of self-promoting Germans who simply want to capture the treasure for their own reward.
If your so board out of your mind and you can't sleep then laugh yourself to sleep at this movie.
If you have better things to do then you know what to do.
and then there are BAD movies (stinkers which haven't one ounce of inspiration).
Actually there is but they only appear for one short scene to get Helm out of a tight spot then are completely forgotten about for the rest of the movie .
If you really like Jerry then you'll most likely go for this one, otherwise it will bore you senseless.
Sitting through this felt like more of the same with some lame plot being given and then surprise, the dolls kill somebody!
And then the way he zaps the scientist...
Now I have seen ALL of the Puppet Master movies and besides the first and third episodes the rest were pretty much crap.It's interesting however to see the Puppets start out as evil slayers for their master Andre Toulon, but then become more as heroes fighting evil in the 3rd & 4th movies.
If you like strange then this film is for you.
But then, it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station, right under everyone's noses.
Is this some surreal Bunuel-esquire flick, full of elements which get introduced then dropped just as fast...But no, it turns out it's supposed to be a comedy.
If you like introspection and more internal-thought-voice-overs than dialogue, and fighting scenes shorter than the actual credits, then this is the movie for you...
I like a lot of movies so when I started to watch this I figured it couldn't be worse then something like Crossroads.
If you are interested in very beautiful Norway-like landscapes and ain't worried about the plot, watch it, at least you'll have a few laughs, if you're time is worthy, then pass out and better watch a Kitano movie.
Now you won't hear me complain about that, but if that's all there is, then you just don't have much of a movie.
JAANEMANN.... 1 Leave your mind at home when you go to watch this film 2 direction is great in the beginning (as it apes musicals such as Chicago and moulin rouge) but fails miserably towards the end 3 Screenplay starts off well, then falls apart.
So I get home and boot up the DVD and begin only to find something so horrific that I almost broke the DVD right then and there.
In it's first scenes I thought the movie was promising, and it kept me going for like 20 minutes, without complaining, but when the plot begins to twist, I began to think that it was not worth watching, and then that it's one of the worst movies of the year.
There are some uncomfortable scenes such as when Bullock's 16 year old brother jumps into bed with MJ and says that she will be the one to "deflower" him and then immediately falls asleep.
I think I laughed once during this movie, when someone made a remark about the "Lambada", and even then, I was only laughing because I kind of knew what the lambada was.
The audience only laughed on spotted occassions, and often the laughter was patched even then.
There are some cool death scenes early on, but then the pace seems to plod for ages.
She then hacks him up.
Unlike most movies of the time (including the vastly overrated Godfather), director Bob Fosse does not keep the action entirely linear; rather event A will happen in scene 1, you then have scene 2 dealing with an unrelated issue, then the consequence of event A will be played out in scene 3.
But then, he/she's likely to have long since tipped his hand by continually denigrating all that questions Marxist/socialist dogma.
When he's "speed reading" he takes more time to turn a page then he does pretending to read.
Back in the day, I thought a blonde was a stupid choice for playing the character, but back then I didn't know Carolyn Jones was a redhead herself.
Uncle Fester who in the first 2 was played by Christopher LLoyd(and brilliantly may I add), now they have some hyper active freak who goes around yelling and screaming like a two year old doing stupid pranks...It was then that it hit me, this new movie was not intended to be a sequel to the previous two.
Which then prompted and almost asleep insomniac to be awake for the next 4 hrs.
However, there's at least one messy special effect worth seeing & at less than a hour in length it moves along at a decent enough pace although even then it failed to really grip or engage me.
There were no surprises in this completely unoriginal erotic thriller, but then again, who watches these films for the plot?
If you find cutting and self-mutilation to be disgusting, then this is the film you want to either see or avoid.
And then another werewolf shows up to try and mate.
So he mouths the words "no mind" whenever he fights from then on.
However, if you are interested in this time period and in the modernization of Japan in the later 19th century, then steer clear of this shameless Tom Cruise vehicle.
The story continues, then, a few days later, there is a horrendous thunderstorm that blows in, serves some plot points, then moves on.
And then we go back in time, back to the beginning, to see how these two ill-fated lovers met and what brought them to the rather unfortunate situation we have just seen.
It's a frustrating movie to watch because it started with such promise and then just does not work at all.
If they were going to put all this money and effort into making sure the special effects were good, then they really should have made sure they had some kind of storyline, and some reason to make the film.
But then again, I wasn't looking for Oscar material.
OK, I know this isn't much of a review as I haven't actually watched it all, but this isn't much of a film either and unless its got the biggest midway change since 'The Jazz Singer' then I can safely say don't watch this film.
It has a story, but it seems to be more fitted to a short film then a feature length movie.
The hero jumps in after most of the movie is over and then finally does something heroic instead of notifying the police!
The film starts off good, with one unlucky caller meeting their demise, and then the main characters are introduced but once the scares start coming, it all falls apart.
But even then, it takes almost forever for that to even start.
At first she offers to testify, then withdraws after learning her sister (Doris Day) is married to one of the Klansmen (Steve Cochran, in a wonderfully loutish performance as the murderer).
The movie kicks off with a hideously deformed boy being brutally murdered and then hung down a mine shaft.
After Pumpkinhead is resurrected you might as well turn off your DVD player (or if you're old school, VHS player) and turn the movie into a novelty flying disc because then at least you can say that it's a GOOD movie (trust me, it glides real nice and cuts air like a hot knife through butter).
But then again, I didn't exactly have high hopes for this film...after all, how good can a film be when Roger Clinton plays a guy called Mayor Bubba?
Jumping back to the black and white beginning (rip off of the technique first used by the Wizard of Oz), I know we watch these movies for blood and gore, but the opening scene when the deformed Tommy is chased down hanged, sliced and diced, then dumped down the old iron mine was truly shocking, I found my mouth hanging open and I am no pansy when it comes to violence, blood and guts.
In fact, all it takes for her to see the light in mitchum's soul is to see him shell civilian refugees into kibble then justify it because 'half' of them were communist infiltrators anyway.
They're both then seduced by a German rich aristocrat named Max(Helmut Griem).
At one point you can see an actor drop his gun, and then the animal wrangler an camera leads a horse of camera.
Maybe then he could have made something that wasn't so bad...
During the Mexican carivan scene first the guy drops his gun then a black man in a animal wrangle outfit walks into the shot, real bad editing... kinda funny though...
All these get a little screen time, then off for the next CC's.
if the warden really do, then Jesse Mowatt was doing something good, and it is not up to a "true evil" to do something good, if the story wanted to make a clear story.
So all I'm saying is if that you really want to test it, if you really want to see how Bad Dennie Hoppper can be, then go ahead.
We then jump back and forth between the Mexican man who was driving the pick-up, named Cesar and another Mexican man who has been locked in a cage and is being transported somewhere.
Don't even bother with The Quickening, just watch the first movie and then skip to the third one (after all, that's what the producers did).
One of the best aspects of "Cabaret," then, is that it truly does feel like you're watching a movie from 1931.
You'll get chills and frown at the end....but then you'll rewind to the beginning and watch it all over again.
If this had been the version that was originally released on the theatre's in 1991, then the series would still have been alive today.
You can't just change the premise from the first film of what the immortals are, then bring back one that was dead.
Ramirez holds up several tons of spinning concrete, then dies again?
This movie seems like it didn't leave the script-writing process until they finished shooting, and then they skipped editing.
If blame were slurry and required apportioning by EU agricultural directive then you'd need roughly 6 tankers worth, each containing somewhere in the region of 40,000 tonnes.
When, in 1999, the Earth's ozone layer was nearly completely gone, MacLeod created The Shield Corporation, which then created a shield which would protect the Earth from the sun's violent rays.
The power of their lifeforce makes him young once again and free to kiss terrorist Louise Marcus (Virginia Madsen) and then try to take down the world's anti-Ozone shield.
So then Katana comes to Earth to kill MacLeod, who is suddenly super-cool and ready to kill Katana.
shows and then write a synapses for my film class.
If the execs over there are idiotic enough to run this, then they obviously hate their viewers.
The next seen Eric is pregnant, they both look sad then go to the grocery and sing about corn.
OK or how about a "live" sketch where Eric is on the street wearing a sign saying "Handy Twenty" then when people think he's going to give a H-job he really just wants to give hand shakes- brilliant!
This show seems to be compiled of sketches where the writers feel that if they put down the first thing that pops into their head then it will automatically be funny.
If this is true, then we the viewer as student have failed miserably.
If you lived the 80's then this may be a fun albeit painful remembrance for you.
If not, then you'll cringe not at the horror stories but of the hair and clothes of the actors.
I can't think of a single reason why you would want to watch this but then what do I know.
Way better then if Jennifer Aniston (the original choice, thanks to Brad) was chosen.
It's really no different then other movies that we all know the outcome of.
Wait for the DVD, and then you may still think about renting it.
If you liked this sort of in your face routine again and again, then you'd probably like the film.
They say you get more feeling from reading a book before you watch a film, if Executions was a text I doubt you would want to ever see a film of it as you would then understand that sometimes the graphic components ARE stronger than written text.
representation of what people do in coffee-houses then they should be banded as oxygen thieves.
My recommendation for you, the potential viewer, is this: If you're a rabid fan of anyone appearing in the film, then go for it.
Then Meg white repeats the quote and hits a spoon on a coffee cup and it makes a f***ing annoying ringing noise and then she does it again and everyone is like "f***ing stop it."
The one old guy says he wants to take a nap, then he just fucking dies.
And then the ditzy blonde bimbo ringing the cop and saying 'if I get the police involved I'll never see her again' (er, darling.......HE IS THE POLICE!!!)
'Cabaret' is an exciting place for music...  'Cabaret' is the first musical to exploit the notion that life is fascinating because it is ambiguous...   'Cabaret' uses music in an exciting new way... His characters do not disintegrate into song to express their emotions... Rather, a sleazy night club becomes a place where satirical comment on the lives and problems of these characters is made in striking, entertaining, and often in ferocious dances and songs...  'Cabaret' is only one of three major elements that remains separate in the film and then gradually and inexorably become melted into one...
Only once does the film leave the nightclub for a musical number in an outdoor cafÃ©, and then it is for one of the film's most haunting scenes, where a young boy begins to sing 'Tomorrow Belongs To Me'..
Yet, if you surrender to the mind-numbing ineptitude of these derivative, oh-so familiar action plots, then maybe "American Kickboxer 2" might provide you with a bit of forgettable entertainment to waste away 90 minutes.
I have no idea why this movie has a higher rating then House 3 (a.k.a The Horror Show) which is actually quite good.
House 2 is on the other hand is quite possibly one on the worst horror sequels you will ever see, if you don't believe me then try watching it..  1/5  IMO the original House and House 3 are the only good movies in the entire series.
I never saw it then, but I can see how the average 11 year old of the time would find it funny.
I know this was just made for a laugh, but, for crying out loud, even the dumbest movies have some purpose(if absolutely nothing else, then at least to entertain).
They then just hang out with the mummified guy and try to protect the skull from intruders from other worlds as well as dinosaurs and blah blah blah...
If you loved wackiness of the movie "Big Trouble in Little China" then you may want to check this out.
Plot has to do with another house, this one with Aztec-influenced architecture, also with other-dimensional passages now and then.
The pic then dwells on this old dude in unfunny scenes, but Gross and his buddy (Stark) also show why they never had great careers in the movies.
The acting is way below average, but then again, the script doesn't seem to have anything that anyone could hold onto.
However, I then saw this film.
Those people draw a parallel between lambs and people, if they behave like a conformist or forget about being conformist, if you are not interested in such things, if you are not against everything, then you are a lamb.
What is the point then?
If a movie is not against these institutions, so does not criticize, then it means that the movie is conservative.
This movie was made for people who have read the book, and then they still need a little help.
if you want to see a film that is really bad then see this now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
She is the incarnation of the vamp, both heartless and ingenuous, the sort of lethal woman who drives men crazy and then gives them up like toys.
you showed a clip of you making fun of country music and then showed a clip of people falling asleep during your show, and then you get mad when the teenagers say you suck.
Kennedy: Well what would you do then?
If you want to sit through an hour n half of Jamie Kennedy moaning about fact that a lot of people don't find him funny and getting others to moan about hecklers then sure,pay to see it,but if (like i was),your looking for a few laffs this is not for you.
As I said before Danning is the ONLY reason for someone to watch this (and even then only when it's on cable, as it's not worth renting).
First, he gets de-flowered by Sylvia Kristel (Emmannuelle herself) in "Private Lessons", and then is floored by the charms of Sybil Danning in this movie.
By then, NASA had concrete plans on how they would put a man on the moon and bring them back safely to Earth.
But then a funny thing happened.
Not as bad as "Carnivore", this low budget film is still sh*t, but I have more respect for it then I have for "The Worst Movie Ever, Carnivore".
I will admit, at the beginning I had hopes for it, it was going alright, then they meet up with Bill and it goes downhill from there.
If you are the kind of fan who likes low budget campy kind of stuff, then be my guest.
If you thought carnivore was at the very least okay, then give this one a try, it has a lot of of screen gore, like chainsaw scene in Scarface.
I was probably the worst hour with a few minutes of all my life, first, the actors didn't knew how to act, then, the stories were so stupid that I couldn't believe that someone could listen to them, to worse the things, three silly boys were hearing to a drugged ranger, you think that could be a good movie?
Well, in the scene were they are in the car, one of those guys was laughing like crazy, then, why would someone like to kill a person that hasn't done nothing to you, and to worse the thing, those guys couldn't act good, not even the Indian when is dying.
Honest to God, I liked it more then Schindler's List, Titanic, and Saving Private Ryan combined.
I thought this was cool how the old guy was getting pounded on, then broke that punk kid's arm, then destroyed the mess out of the kid's ear.
but then, if you actually are browsing these reviews to consider this movie, you probably have some semblance of what makes a good movie.
If you want raunchy, hilarious fun, then i would suggest you watch the man show, which airs a new episode every sunday at 10.
I realize I'm probably going very easy on this film but I did like it much more then I thought I would, it's a guilty pleasure that's worth 90 minutes of mindless enjoyment if you can find it for the right (read VERY LOW) price.
Then we are introduced to the story of two guys with a broken down car who meet a random girl, and then, respectively, a Southern Deputy.
It takes up less time then the sub-stories.
Well, they know that he's unstable, saying that he killed his family, and then unburied them and "killed them again."
The gardener then kills all the kids who are too ****ing dumb to use the golf clubs they have to bludgeon the killer from a distance OR to stick together so he couldn't possibly stand a chance since he, like this movie, sucks really bad.
And then a deputy who is southern (even though nobody else in the scene is) agrees to investigate the stalker for No Name.
And then the stalker is forgotten in lieu of a fake teen sex scene.
We have a whole series of similar false endings here where you think the mystery has been cleared up then BANG Mr Ward decides an already over cluttered screenplay isn't complicated enough so he adds yet another plot twist which makes the story more and more ridiculous as it trundles along   Merlin I hope you make a success of your career but remember one thing - Less is more
And then there is also a mysterious man who was seen near her hotel on several occasions.
It's supposed to be a black comedy about a cad (Chaplin) who plays women like violins and then murders them, but there's little to no humour to be found here.
But then he made a succession of stinkers, in the form of A Man Apart (2002), Pitch Black 2 (2004) and The Pacifier (2005).
Starts off great introducing Vin Diesel and the setting and setting up the action and basic plot (lots of money spent on sets, too) so it looks like it is going to be a great epic action movie but gets boring about halfway through because the action becomes pointless because you don't know why people are chasing them and killing each other and then the movie simply ends without explaining.
I would have added in maybe 5 minutes of somebody simply talking and explaining what was going on instead of having that last chase scene and then she gives birth to twins and then Vin adopts them and then the end???!!!!
Sadly it seems to me like someone wrote a script with a vast back-story, a director shot said script to best of his abilities (as said some of the cinematography is kind a cool) and then it was given to some cutter with the demand to cut everything but the action scenes.
If you don't laugh out loud a few times in this movie then you have no sense of humor, and the end is a total shocker.
So then they toss in "maybe she's carrying a viral weapon"... ooh!
the acting was average, but i didn't expect much from vin diesel and Michelle Yeoh did a decent job, other then that wait to this hits USA or TBS, don't even rent it from blockbuster, its not worth it.
This movie is pretty decent..." then the ending happened, well, what ending?
She and Toorop have an immediate power struggle, and then during the mission Aurora exhibits more and more strange powers and abilities.
The movie moves along from one on-location set piece to the next, with action scenes and fights popping up out of nowhere and then wrapping up nicely as our heroes rush off screen to the next set.
I always liked Shannon from her Beverly Hills, 90210 days and felt the show sunk down when she left, I thought she'd make more of her career afterwords, but then again, who on that show did?
This movie started off really horrible and I almost gave up on it because of the stupidity but then there were tons of sex scenes and the whole movie redeemed itself in some way.
At first all she want's to eat are flies which is fine, but she begins to grow (it's flower pot must also have the ability to grow as well) & quickly moves onto frogs, then it's dogs from the local pound.
She then decides she want's to eat a person & promptly eats Henry's overbearing, annoying & dominating Mother.
It makes no attempt to develop any of the characters, then again the only significant character in the entire film is Henry.
(As an aside, the nurse changes clothes 3 times in going from the office to the cat food plant and then back to the office.)
then the doc and his nurse start poking around the cat food maker's building, and find out what his secret ingredient really is.
I have to say i enjoy most bad movies that are so bad they're good but this is not one of them.this one is really bad,i thought it would be like the classic b movie the undertaker and his pals but it lacks the style and humor of that film,the concept for this clunker is a greedy nutty business man uses human flesh grinded in a big meat grinder to make expensive cat food.which makes the cats rabid killers who go nuts after eating the cat food with human flesh,Ted V Mikels who made the b movie classic astro zombies made this on a budget of $1.98,well not really but the acting is so bad,its frightening.even the cat attack scenes look fake.amazing that this makes plan 9 from outer space look like gone with the wind.Ed Wood Jr could've done a way better job directing this.if you want to waste about 90 minutes then by all means watch corpse grinders.but as a cult movie i say it is way below its mark.Ray Dannis(undertaker and his pals,severed arm)has a very brief role.and they actually did a sequel in 2000,why?
If you started watching this when it first aired and never finished, then don't bother, it only gets worse with every episode.
But this...I would rather bathe in the waste product of all of New York then stand for this mini-series a second more.
If that's true, then it's no surprise that these women look like stripper rejects.
Also at the opening main characters were equal, an later there is only Hercules, sorry Capt Hunt and every one else is nothing more then a sidekick.
If there is a female in the episode then he is always good for a kiss and more.
So if you want a series with interesting characters and stories then look for something else.
Yet even then, one could not see them in their new roles.
The movie is fairly decent, until said robots (or in this case, robot, as thats all the budget allowed for) shows up, then it loses all sense of forward momentum that the film had going for it.
The acting was OK, I wouldn't echo "great" like others have commented, but then I don't think it would take much to act out this movie...
A Man and a Boy, trying to outrun the Apocalypse, wander into danger, hide, whisper, cower, run, escape ... then wander into new danger (and repeat steps 2,3,4,5 and 6).
A few times a Mexican band played a few bars of Malaguena and then mixed it in with some other music style.
If you thought the movie "Unbreakable" was the bestest movie ever, then you might like this variation of the same theme.
This could be an interesting and compelling viewing experience, but then you better know beforehand to expect a serious-toned film instead of a brainless slasher imitation.
If the pacing and script don't reveal, after about 10 minutes, that she's not truly a corpse after all, then you may be able to actually get into this.
It's a mess of 70's clichÃ©s, which, since it came out in 1981 (although it might have been on the shelf for a while), you've got to believe were stale, even then.
I thought if Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were involved, then this would be a decent flick.
Had he emulated the actual structure and pacing of The Evil Dead, which was a non-stop horror roller-coaster ride, then the result might've been much more successful.
However, if he wishes to create such a stir with fans of more 'traditional' horror films, then he really needs to come up with something better than this.
There is no real plot until the last 15 minutes of the movie (if you last that long) and even then is not worth it.
Instead, we are given a pretty run of the mill, mediocre comedy where the bumbling hero and misfit friends must uncover the evil villain, who until then is seen as the good guy.
Those who are familiar with the Hamlet text will be able to make a connection, but if the benefit of modernization is to familiarize those who are unfamiliar with Shakespeare, then this film fails in its office.
And then we come to Ethan Hawke, who I generally think is a very talented actor as well.
One of the first films produced (but not directed) by Roger Corman is marginally okay tale of convict (John Ireland, who directed) who escapes from prison and then kidnaps Dorothy Malone and uses her and her sports car as a cover for entry into a race that will get him across the border and to freedom.
When the star car starts the race it is with white wire wheels, full width bumpers and without a front license plate, then at the first turn the plate appears, then the front bumpers disappear and become little bumperettes, then they reappear, the wheels change from white to dark and back again, and so on throughout the race.
When the race is half over, the girl back at the starting line jumps into an Allard and somehow catches up to the Jags, by which time the Allard has changed color twice, and gained a spare tire on first the right side, then the left, then the right again, and now it has portholes in the side, definitely not the same Allard she started with.
There is no discussion on Israeli human rights abuses, the numerous terrorist attacks carried out by Zionists in the decades prior to Israel's foundation, the attacks by Israeli extremists since then (such as the massacre of dozens of worshipers at Hebron's mosque by a Jewish settler), the routine killings of Palestinian civilians by Israeli snipers, etc.
if most people voted "I agree, your life sucks" then it probably would have been because of her aunt who just never told her the right stuff (again, just for the sake of driving the storyline someplace...)   Good for a younger age group and eye-candy or if you want to just sit back and not think too much -- don't watch it if you expect something remotely profound, witty, smart or innovative out of the storyline.
This review, then, is based on Chaplin's earliest films.
Chaplin is dressed as an Englishman who appears to first propose to a young lady and then must find work.
It's clear audiences must have taken to a lot of fighting in films then, but the repeated scrapes come off as pure silliness.
Most of these films were ad-libbed then, which explains the relative disjointedness on film.
After catching the first two episodes of this show and then taking a gander at this site's message board, it's pretty apparent that it is the teenage girls, and sadly a handful of grown women who are attracted to the so-called "Hotti-Gotti" boys as they've been dubbed who continue to watch with regularity and keep this pitiful and wretched excuse for entertainment (which can be likened to a type of mental Novocaine if you ask me) afloat just enough to cause A&E to run a second season or so I've been told anyway.
I actually suspected Penn of being the killer for a while- so right away, I didn't question why/how he was at the Depot- then after he was killed, I now wonder how/why he was there.
There are some okay sections of this piece, but then we have characters acting and reacting to things in ways that make no sense at all.
The film starts to lose its grip on the story, and it eventually becomes a sloppy "free for all," which then presents major plot holes.
If poor storyline, poor acting and 'loads' of bullets flying around is your scene then this is the movie for you.
Not bad for $15,000, but then again... it's quite bad.
If you love Victorian romance films, D.H. Lawrence or the films of Ken Russell then you appreciate more than the average viewer.
And then there was the profanity.
However if like me the bile that has built up inside you, days after the accursed event has reached boiling point and you feel that you must reach out to the world and cry "SCOOOOOBYYY DON'T" then this might be slightly more your cup of tea.
It does explain how Reggie is involved but it's rather throwaway and unconvincing , the script would have been much better if it concentrated on niggling little things like how can characters be abducted from a supermarket and brought into a busy nightclub without anyone calling the cops   If you loved the original then you might enjoy this sequel but it was spoiled by a very clumsy script
By sheer coincidence I saw this movie again about 24 hours after I wrote the review(purely coincidental)  I had seen this when it first came out and then seen part of it again and did not like it AT ALL.
Also, as in many sequels they took a part of something that worked, and then overdid it the second time.
It abandons the old neighborhood from the first movie, adds a bunch of characters that are introduced then forgotten, there are no references to the cop (Nunn) that helped out Whoopi in the original and aside from Sister Mary Patrick (Najimy, always good for a laugh), everyone looks bored beyond belief.
There's a rogue cop who was killed in an accident and then "Robo-copped" together to be a killing machine, and he has sixteen tongues grafted onto his body to replace his burned skin, so as you can imagine he doesn't look very "GQ".
The male character, Adrian Torque (Crawford James), was killed during the last war and then brought back to life.
And then there's Ruth Buzzi.
Nothing was said about Canadians sending their slaves to what is now Michigan (then still held by Britain) to avoid emancipation.
I will say this and then be done with it.
So we invade Mexican, Annex the country, and then enslave the Mexican people.
If you do, then its mostly just annoying.
Bond has to fall over the cliff after the plane has fallen before him, skydive to catch it up Â defying the laws of physics Â and then fly away.
We then move into the second part, which follows the vampire queen; played by a skinhead who looks a bit like Grace Jones.
It is worth pointing out that there is not really any blood or violence in HOWLING V. If you are silly enough to enjoy this cheap crap then may I recommend that you buy a tin of paint, throw it up a wall and sit and watch it dry, because you are obviously very easily entertained.
It really is, then, like a game of Clue, with about the same amount of depth, where characters are gradually eliminated one by one, merely for the sake of finding out who the killer really is, and not for suspense.
If the acting is bad, you don't care about the characters, and it's genuinely not scary then at least you should get some cool werewolf/gore/kill scenes.
The film chooses to be sci-fi and then it chooses to have melodrama as well?
You hit the brakes and try to swerve the car, but you end up hitting him/her anyway, then going off the road and ramming a telephone pole.
someone falling in love, getting married and having a baby, husband dieing and then remarrying; is that what u need to watch in a 3 hr long, so called family drama movie ?!
John Abraham, as good looking he might be, needs to learn little bit of dancing too if he wants to survive in bollywood; but then i might be wrong.. And Salman Khan definitely needs to learn acting.
BAGHBAN was scripted 40 years back and it was modified and it had some good emotional moments bt yet it was too oldfashioned   Here too the story sounds 2000 years old  Rani Mukherjee's role, her dress sense, her acting, her smiling is all too bad Don't know why she is boring to watch Seriously i loved her in YUVA, HUM TUM but nowdays she is just doing the same roles, same acting style, even her dress scenes are outrageous  I don't understand people praising her like hell here, she has no role just to cry after Salman dies and then get married because Amitabh says so  About the rest as i said the story is like PREM ROG(1982) and the handling is not at all convincing  The all hoopla done about the clash of titans between Amitabh and Om is just 5 minutes talk  Direction by Ravi Chopra is outdated Music is outdated  Amitabh once again demonstrates his acting skills and overshadows everyone but he is getting monotonous with such roles Salman does well in the first half, nothing new but he is more lively and less animated then in most of his films John looks sick(he was suffering from jaundice those days) but fails in his acting here Hema Malini is just there in the movie, her role lacks substance In fact the director doesn't at all care for women's wishes in the film supposedly based on women role improvement in society Rajpal comes does some usual gags and is forgotten Parmeet Sethi has no role Om Puri is too loud
If the title of this summary weren't self-explanatory, then let me begin my ranting about how clichÃ©d this movie actually was.
Really, if they wanted to show that widows can remarry then they should have made it like this : Even though Sallu dies, Rani gets over him in 5-6 yrs.
After some time she starts dating John and falls in love with him and then they get married and then all the drama.
Why then bother to go to cinema?
If this is what families of today are meant to sit down and watch together, then I am afraid we are looking at a very simple minded and uneducated future, with appauling senses of humour.
The two develop a friendship and then a romance.
Disheartened Mona then encounters Tamsin's sister, Sadie, whom she and us, had been led to believe died due to anorexia.
I had also seen an interview with one of the stars on Fuse a while back and desired to see it then.
Wonderful colors.... Hmmmmm what else can I say..... awful storyline, awful comedy, awful acting, just plain awful... even back then....
Maybe I'm just missing something, I don't know, or perhaps I don't know enough about the inner circles of independent film-making to be able to see how this film succeeds; but if that is the case, then what are we supposed to think of a film so "smart" that its audience doesn't even get it?
If this is the case, then bam!, you hit the mark Oppenheimer.
There is one scene in which Heidi watches a film and then a few days later the romantic scene that occurred in the film happens to her in "real life."
I thought, hey this could be interesting, then I found out how absolutely, insanely, ridiculously stupid it really was.
The basic plot of this movie is as follows: a Japanese wife gets bored and decides to run away from her husband by pretending she is kid-napped, ends up as a hostage in a robbery then falls in love with one of her captors, a big beefy Aussie bloke played by Russell Crowe.
However, the calmness of the household is broken when Jekyll starts to stay out all night, he then says he will be collaborating with an assistant named Mr. Edward Hyde (John Malkovich) on his experiments & he should be treated as they treat him.
This would give any period Hammer Horror flick a good run for it's money, then again I suppose you can stage a film like this when you have nearly 50 million dollars as your budget.
They are then divided into 2 tribes which compete against each other for "immunity."
They then compete for "individual immunity."
The whole tribe then goes to tribal council and must vote off one of their members.
When I first started watching it I didn't mind it at all, it wasn't to bad, then it started getting crap.
And then he launches into a narrative about his next movie - and how good this next one, as opposed to all the losers before it, is going to be.
This is one of those kind of movies that give you the very sad situation and then very happy ending.The film itself is about a canadian police officer who is put in jail as an undercover cop to investigate the murders of few locals.
Fortunatly the guard stops to tell an injured black man how he's certainly going to shoot him then stands there smiling into space for over 7 seconds before Priest (with no real explanation why he's there)simply walks in and shoots him.
Come on guys, if you call THIS good then you haven't seen nothing yet.
Anthony Hopkins is interesting as a primatologist who lived with gorillas for a couple of years and then was sent to prison for killing poachers.
Apparently the story starts with Dorian's grandfather coming home from a hard days work building atomic bombs and then killing his daughter .
Several of the previous reviews for this episode remarked, in my opinion, more upon the reviewers love for the series rather then this episode.
It's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style.
And then there is the pace of the story, which is more like a crawl than a rush.
If you go to movies to see the stars rather than the stories, then this may be for you.
They would pop up on TV shows and then disappear.
I hate it when people say that if you win all the challenges then you should win.
And then there's this female reporter (Kay Lentz), see, who's gonna do a report of the man and then there's this ken-do fighting cable guy (Richard Hatc), who because of an accident gets hooked up in this and they all are like sent into a parallel universe.
Apparently many in USA felt a genuine fear of an invasion back then (whenever that was).
It is understandable, since it resembles a TV show more then a serious film.
What baffles me is that these directors are given millions of dollars to produce a blockbuster and then they churn out rubbish like this!
And if the target audience doesn't come from Europe, who is this kinder-garden-lecture aimed for then...?
The Core runs for a very long 135 minutes and it feels longer then that.
Just like 'Dog Soldiers' it was more then good and added some new life to the whimpering sub-genre.
He says something about the wavelength increasing (ding right), and then says the frequency will decrease (bzzz wrong).
There needs to be a potential drop for power to be gained, and if there was a ground, then anyone that touched the hull would have been electrocuted.
Now and then I thought I was watching a danish soft-core comedy from the 70s.
things degenerate from then on.
However, Lucky Numbers gives us no sympathetic characters and then wants us to care for them.
Ok I didn't compleatly hate this movie, I liked everything up to the point where they won the lottery then the whole thing took a tragic nose dive.
Were offered many interesting characters for a few minutes, then most of them die.
See it free, and even then you are spending your precious time, more than enough payment.
Well, don't waste your timeÂthis was perhaps the most boring film I have seen in yearsÂIt was boring, then briefly brutal then boring againÂit tries to be artistic but it's really just autisticÂit's not a daring brave piece of filmmaking because it truly makes no senseÂI tried very hard to find either the reason for the woman's actions or the hidden meaning in themÂNOTHING!
They then met rich old ladies through the correspondence, killed them and took their money.
If she were then her partner in crime would have soon got rid of her before she bungled their plans.
Even then, the movie contains nothing to write home about.
He chooses exile but decides to break out to gain revenge on Stavros who`s planning to kill Quinn`s wife and new born child   If the last paragraph makes much sense then I`ve probably explained it all wrong because the plot is totally underdeveloped with a massive amount of scenes that lead nowhere .
Also if you are wanting one of the best final showdowns between good and evil then the ending of double team will blow you away.
Oh, a certain kind of audience will love this kind of thing, but somehow, this particular movie seemed to permanently typecast Van Damme as a 2nd rater, a hack actor in the same vein as Rutger Hauer, Dolph Lundgren and, yes, Steven Seagal...All these actors also started off with a big splash in well designed vehicles that showcased their talents...and then faded into B-to-Z movie hackdom as the casting agencies and action directors moved on to other, fresher faces.
Of course, no prison can hold Quinn, who meticulously engineers his escape in one brilliant sequence (the best one in the entire film, in fact), teams up with flamboyant arms-dealer Yaz (Color-me-bad former San Antonio Spurs basketball sensation Dennis Rodman) and together the two go after Stavros, who has kidnapped Quinn's pregnant wife and is threatening to kill her once the baby is born and then raise it has his own.
Imagine watching dust collect for an hour and a half and then you get the exact idea of what it was like watching this movie.
If his age isn't the main culprit for the film's weird failings, then it may be his stiflingly traditional film-making, which seemed a bit outmoded in 1984.
And then the soundtrack.
Eva is better by a hair width, she is always cool but then frightened and brave.
As this movie is the worst movie ever, though the storyline is very very common two friends in love, but their ego comes between, than then they find someone i n their life to avoid their friendship, but as I told you naa a very common story, in end they again meet, so please guys its a humble request don't go for this flick its a complete waste of time and money.
If you are over 13, then you probably won't like this.
I am certain that some people of a mentally retarded predicament would appreciate it but even then they don't.
It stinks I can't give this less then 1-star but since I can't this will have to do even though it deserves a -10.
The farting reindeer wasn't funny the first time and then they had them fart AGAIN about 20 seconds later like it would be funny that time, and it wasn't.
If you enjoy the feeling you get when you eat way to much or when you had a really hard day or when you have a killer headache then watch this movie.
And then two weeks ago the Santa Claus three came out and wow was I disappointed.
He isn't Santa for a grand total of approximately 20 minutes, and then all the sudden he is Santa again.
We see Allen then and Allen now.
It's sad to see that many people have misunderstood it, but then again, it's certainly not meant for everyone.
He then proceeded to stumble his way through the production and managed to put something together that, and I don't say this lightly, was a movie.
On the one hand this is funny (such as the scenes with him walking in on a party and then befriending her "misunderstood" boyfriend, which winds up costing him his Jaguar), but on the other, the repetition may start to weigh on the viewer as the story becomes insurmountably ridiculous (I'm not sure where Danza was going with the explanation about being involved in the lunch counter sit-ins when he is under the impression that Leroy might have come to pick up his daughter for a date).
The visual imagery of having two individuals exchange identities, and then no one notices, is absurd.
This film is like when you're sitting around drunk with your friends and some guy says something clever, and then you're like "Oh dude that would make a cool movie!"
So I get home and boot up the DVD and begin only to find something so horrific that I almost broke the DVD right then and there.
In it's first scenes I thought the movie was promising, and it kept me going for like 20 minutes, without complaining, but when the plot begins to twist, I began to think that it was not worth watching, and then that it's one of the worst movies of the year.
Here are but a few examples: there are no colonels in the US Navy; men on the disabled sub were having difficulty breathing, but they were not breathing "carbon monoxide" as the med staff suggested unless their exhaust was leaking into the compartment; lifting off from an arms seller's supposedly isolated base of operations, the Nighthawk rolls along a clearly marked runway, then passes a VOR station, a type of navaid that would assist in identifying the location of this base.
If you have read the other three reviews of this documentary, then yeah, mine is pretty much the same.
The kids, in fact, didn't really talk about how they felt living with two "mothers" and then three.
If you have seen the original Disney cartoon based on an Italian story about a wooden puppet who becomes a real boy, then you'll probably know the story already.
The kid who plays Pinocchio is just weird and idiotic, I mean first he doesn't know what's going on, and then suddenly he has ideas of his own about things.
Enter Teacher's Pet, Disney's hand-animated feature (released on the heels of the announcement that it is shutting down its Florida animation studio) based on the popular kids series about a dog named Spot (Nathan Lane) who wants nothing more then to become a boy.
However, it takes a lot more then just strong visuals to form a well-crafted animated feature Âand Teacher's Pet is a prime example of why.
This is supposed to be a kids film -I don't need to explain to my four-year old niece why Spot is now a middleÂaged man hitting on moms and shacked up in some sleazy motel- if they wanted "edgy" then they should have pitched it to Matt Stone.
If it was trying to be the film equivalent satirical TV comedy such as Absolute Power or Bremner, Bird and Fortune - perhaps with a little of the great State of Play thrown in, then it failed miserably.
If you don't get it, then he probably doesn't want you to.
If you like John Ritter( I liked him better in Three's Company), then you might like this movie.
He enlists an unwitting Sal Mineo as an accomplice, robs the legation of $600,000 after murdering a security guard, then tries to pin the crime on Mineo by bumping him off.
And then, as the mystery unfolds, or rather the solution to the mystery unfolds, I found Hector Elizondo not the most engaging of Columbo's adversaries.
It would've worked better if Blair Underwood were still a great guy until the end, exemplifying the patience, sincerity and charming qualities that made Brian the winner, and then some.
These types of sketch are better off on YOU TUBE, and there are plenty of YOU TUBE-comedians that are way funnier then a lot of these sketches.
i thought it was a so called "movie" movie but it wasn't so i kept looking into it and thought it would be funny and entertaining  and then when watching it recently i was excited and then watching it i was shocked by its stupidity  boring jokes, unfunny views and Andy Milonokas.
Ryan Pinkston did fine but then movie is too bad to be covered up by the acting only.
Some is so bad it is only embarrassing, but then again, there are a few jokes which are still pretty bad, but where I couldn't help myself and laugh a little.
If you're looking for answers or messages within the subtext of this film (and I use the term "subtext" lightly), then you will probably not find much in the trashy, nihilistic jerks who populate this trashy, nihilistic vision of LA.
And yet somehow, despite most odds, Araki actually manages to construct a film around interesting, affectionate characters, and then pit them in an environment of illicite sex and drugs, disillusionment and disaffection, all while maintaining a level of pathos that (for the most part) is genuine.
And then along comes this movie.
However, if you're not sick of Michael Cera's awkwardness yet, then it's used perfectly here.
If you've been enjoying the movies Michael Cera has been putting out... then probably skip this one.
Well if the Disney studio couldn't have gotten any worse back then well check out this piece of work!
If it was to show how Hollywood hitters go back to their roots and learn acting 101, then so be it Â but it had to be longer.
For those of us that have blocked out the traumatic parts of growing up, then it is understandable why you don't understand this movie.
Stalwarts of British comedy acting then and later, plus George Sanders, fight manfully against one of the stupidest plots imaginable - about a government-sponsored brothel for the gentry in late 19th century London.
They can be an awful film more then this?
I saw the promos i was interested especially the first promo but the last few promos gave away and i hoped the film won't be as bad but the film is worst  Abbas-Mustan tried to make a commercial potboiler instead just to appeal to the masses who like such nonsense films  The film starts off okay, 2 songs at the start itself and then slowly each characters are introduced but then the film gets boring because All characters are jerks  Paresh Rawal- Johny scenes are stupid and too loud and crass Shahid- Kareena scenes are worthless and boring They is little hope when Isha is murdered but the director is too involved with comedy, romance and nothing makes sense in the end  The Johny- Tanaaz finding a dead body in the briefcase is too childish and then the entire investigating scenes are not that great  But the end takes the cake, one of the worst climaxes ever Even the CID episodes have better culmination  Abbas-Mustan give their worst ever film Music is good  Shahid and Kareena who were a pair that time are truly wasted Shahid just keeps making big eyes trying to look funny and make weird noises while Kareena irritates Akshaye imitates his dad Vinod Khanna at places and is the only actor worth mentioning here Tanaaz and Johny overact Paresh Rawal overacts too while Payal Rohatgi and Isha are dismissal Upen Patel with a dubbed voice is painful rest are poor
If you are one of those who watch with child-like eyes and accept what you see without really demanding believable acting, stunts, story and script, then this movie is for you.
Fact is, TV movies aren't exactly an art form and if you're looking for authenticity and the truth about sufferers of this terrible genetic disease and the effect that it has on the people around them, you'd be much better off down the library doing research then subjecting yourself to the tabloid treatment that this film reduces it to.
Funny, for about 10 seconds, then it is an absolute waste of time.
A typical set up is a shot of bear growling, cut to a shot of a terrified actor, then another shot of bear growling again.
Plot devices are introduced but then immediately discarded.
Barrels of toxic waste near a body of water are shown then immediately forgotten about.
Of course not, because by then the damn bear would have moved on and the movie would have ended with their eventual rescue.
Decoteau shows the bear howling, walking on all fours and then rearing up on its back legs, but you rarely see anything but the wrecked vehicle in the same shot with the critter.
The first casualty--Ritch Petroski (Brody Harms of "Adam & Evil")occurs about 20 minutes into the action, and the shook-up survivors tear off in their Jeep and then have second thoughts about leaving their poor mauled friend behind.
Lauren is gutted about the Grizzly Bear but what the hell, then suddenly the four friends find out that the young (dead) Bear's mother is around & very angry at the four friends for killing her kid & sets out to kill them all in a Grizzly rage...
And if not, then it's lousy film-making.
And then an actor flies through the air.
Even then it's wrong.
Moving on, they fool around in their 4wd kill a bear cub and then get hunted by the oh so predictable toxically challenged bear mom.
The driver then starts on a 20 klick run (in flip-flops no less) for help, but momma bear has him for porridge.
But even then, I predict even that fun would be drained by the terrible ending.
Literally, they all die, and then the credits roll.
I'll instead close by writing everything that is good about this film........  Thankfully it didn't waste any more of our lives then 90 minutes.
The cabin scene is the only scene that was remotely well done, but then it's back to stupid behavior by the next victim who leaves the safety of the cabin when he hears the bear growling.
It would probably be a good idea to see the film first then read the book to note the comparison, and in doing so also raise the bar on the story.
If you haven't read the book, then go read it because there are many gaps that the movie created, that the novel will fill.
It might have worked better if they kept the construction that King originally established, but even then it would have hardly stood, as they took the events for no reason.
And then, the worst two bastardizations.
And then the Turtle (don't ask, read) is also gone, losing the relation to the universe that Stephen King set up in the novel.
Read the book, and then wait for the remake.
Like I said, if you think it's good just because other people like it, then you're out of your mind.
If director Donald Jones would have been capable of gloriously depicting all the rancidness he suggests in the script (including rape, torture, necrophilia and incest), then "Schoolgirls in Chains" indeed would have been a genuine exploitation classic, but now it's just a mildly offensive & amusingly inept 70's trash-gem.
Gregg Champion is a TV movie director, whose groundbreaking technique seems to involve placing the camera down and then rushing off for a cup of tea while the actors say their lines in front of it.
But after In The Heat of the Night, The Defiant Ones and Lilies of the Field - to name just three Â then why did it have to come to this?
But just tracking down a comment on youtube ... Caroline Ellis was "Joy" on the Bugaloos kids TV show, very popular in US early morning Saturday shows in the 70's... she was cute then ... guess she was tired of looking like she was only going to act in parts for the kiddie shows ... supposedly she has full nudity in this film, front and back, according to another.
Probably quite risquÃ© back then.
If so, then good luck to ya...
If I don't care about at least one main character, or a character's motivations, or even what's going to happen to that character, then the movie's failed.
The cartoon cat then sets out with the other animals into the big city (which is populated by cartoon animals even though the farm has a human family) to find Chanticleer, who has turned into an Elvis parody and is being seduced by a sexy chicken.
Okay, then they wouldn't have hated the sun so much, but having owls wanting to eat pigs doesn't make any more sense!
2) Story logic: Everyone believes Chanticleer makes the sun rise every morning, but then they see it come up without him, so they think he's a fraud.
But then it turns out it DOESN'T rise without him.
Is it able to come up by itself a single time, but then needs him to continuously do so?
She appears in one scene toward the beginning of the movie, and then she disappears.
Good guy John Abbott Sr. was dumbed down and then eliminated only to show up as stupid, clueless ghost criticizing his only son ad nauseum.
Far fetched story line, but then this is science fiction...not reality.
I mean is spraying thousands of tonnes of ice into the air going to put out huge fires in the atmosphere, and then ice starts raining from the sky and everyone goes all happy-clappy.
I chase you; then you chase me; then we chase him; etc.
Just then the other guy calls.
This was one film i wanted to watch always when it released The promos were eye catching and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise  But the film isn't that good  It has lot of flaws  The start is good and till the murder everything goes well but the film falls flat when the romance track starts between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow  Then the twist about Govinda and Tabu being in love leaves more doubts and flaws and then How come Govinda turns into a rich criminal from a poor villager?
Back in 1977 when I saw this movie at the theatre with my husband (then boyfriend), we both sincerely wished we'd found some paint and watched it dry instead.
So I was all set to enjoy this one, until I realized early on that it was gonna be one of those movies where the Ambitious Career Gal is taught to stop fighting her True Womanly Nature, which of course means she lets an aggressive doofus wear her down 'til she agrees to marry him, then sublimates and channels her ambitions through him, to help him get off his lazy butt and make something of himself.
What then?
And then - inexplicable, implausible "love".
Wayne Morris and Priscilla Lane star as a couple who work in the city and then move to the suburbs.
Morris is initially an obnoxious boob, then he is a rather sexist but loving husband with no great ambitions and then he becomes a HUGE high-powered executive.
The dumbest part of this was his falling for an ambitious and talented Lane and then insisting, after they are married, that she drop everything to be his stay at home wife.
When they marry, she seems pretty happy but then dumps her hubby over practically nothing--as if she were doing this purely as a plot device.
'The Burbs' was intelligent because it kind of put you in a safe and familiar environment then turned it on it's head.
I wont get into the fundamental differences between now and then, not that it isn't painfully obvious, but it is true that vets coming home today do not get that same treatment.
And anything that does happen is often ludicrous, especially a particularly stupid sequence with 50 Cent going crazy and holding hostages in a fast food restaurant and then getting shot by a police sniper.
Thankfully there was no political horn-blowing in the movie, but then again, there wasn't any plot either.
-Ah, but then the fun begins again, and they forget about their troubles and make fun of Leo Getz again and the saxophone plays again,and the mood is :)...and then Riggs is a "son of a bitch" again, and Murtaugh in insensitive not to take Riggs in account when he decides to retire for yet another time...?!?
I suspect they only made this movie because it was so cheap then to shoot movies in Romania.
They go on about how they've tracked down missing scenes, remastered it all and redone the soundtrack... it's like a kid telling you how they've done an amazing drawing and you then look at it...
It picks up for the last half hour, but really drags until then.
I enjoyed it then as well.
Jones then sucks the blood of the man and keeps him in the freezer in fear that if he is caught that he will be found guilty of the man murder.
That goes nowhere so we're then supposed to be impressed by Diamond's use of a lie detector after Brown agrees to be questioned.
I suppose you like watching Chinese people talk/walk/dance/text message, then this is the film for you.
Mitchum's family is losing livestock, then lives, to some big cat.
Some people don't realize even then that the old Indian is freaking Alfalfa from "Our Gang" in old Indian makeup.
I suspect that film students from the University of Southern California would have done a much better job then the alleged industry professionals working at, or for Gemstone.
At the end, you figure out what the concept of the film is, but by then, it's a little too late to feel invested in the characters and the plot.
If you enjoyed Maniac Cop or God Told Me To then check it out.
The opening of "Goodnight,God Bless" is quite unsettling and memorable:we see a priest with a rosary walking near the school before murdering a young school teacher with a butcher knife and then shooting 5 school children on the playground and wounding countless others.This sequence is shot in chaotic and hand-held style that certainly packs the punch.Unfortunately after this nasty beginning the film quickly goes downhill.First of all it has more to do with dull cop drama than slasher flick.There are a couple of thrills including the scene of the woman chased through the forest,but the acting is so-so and the ending is abrupt and comes out-of-nowhere.It's a crying shame that "Lucifer" is so terminally boring.4 out of 10.
All she did was prancing around in so-called seductive poses, rather than actually dance, exhibiting what was then called Hollywood's best looking gams.
The acting alone is terrible, the storyline has more holes in it than Swiss cheese, These two friends set out on a journey and start hitch-hiking being picked up by some SPACE-CAKE who ends up trying to kill them, they manage to escape and end up in a quite sleepy town meeting a beautiful lounge girl in a bar, she turns out to some sort of demon-like thing that wants to live a normal life, the whole town seem to have demonic sense to them, there's some other guy who I think is mean't to be the Devil, he wears a 3/4 length leather jacket and big massive leather biker boots, he's looks like a bad guy in Blade or something, then there's these two brothers who are sent down to earth to kill and then recruit people for 'legion of the dead', they constantly get into awkward situations, one of the brothers manages to get injured by falling objects, moving cars, and finally getting blown up, that was slightly funny, the guy who plays the devil comes down to earth to find his bride(demon like girl)and then there's a big fight in the film between good and evil, apart from that DON'T get this film out, because it is so bad, everything in it is so far fetched that I think the guy who made it must have been taking some sort of drugs, acid or speed maybe, but anyway the bottom line is BAD FILM, BAD ACTING, BAD PLOT, funny in certain bits because your actually laughing at how bad the film is...
But then again a director who can make a movie out of a story this bad probably wouldn't give the actors any hints on what to do either.
it starts of as a road movie with the pshyco killer and then goes to a bar.
Every now and then, Ittenbach shows slight signs of ingeniousness through black humor, but the wholesome really stinks.
I think this movie is even worse then Dead and Breakfast.
This would have allowed for us to fully understand Rubby Johnny.... it would then be a feast for the mind as well as a feast for the eyes.
He resembles a comic book palooka, has an extended chin, and walks around like he's trying to be menacing, like he's imitating some real life mean looking guy he knew once who wasn't a rich, trouble actor haunted by natural good looks; Rourke would probably give anything in the world to be a born loser with 'nothing to lose'... but then he'd never be able to write and star in films, would he?
He woos and wins her and then Mitchum shows up.
If you've seen Prince of Philadelphia, the River's Edge, or hell, even Bill and Ted, then you know he can give a good performance.
And then... "Ooh I love the sound of my voice!"
I remember liking this film as a child, so at least on that level Thumbelina is a success for it is a film aimed for the children, but whilst many Disney films can still hold some of their magic for the older audiences, that is where Thumbelina falls down for once the viewer reaches the age where they become critical, then this film will give them much to be negatively critical about.
If Julian Schnabel wanted to examine a picture about sexual freedom then he took the wrong path.
If you want to suffer through a vague politico-serio-tragedy, then "Before Night Falls" will do it.
At forty minutes into it, it felt like an eternity, and then I realized I was not even half-way through.
The soundtrack is OK, and I guess if you're a HUGE Troma fan or are such a big rockabilly fan that you MUST own anything related to the genre, then go for it - otherwise, this is a bore-fest with only minimal redeeming factors.
!The lighting is terrible,just terrible.Most of it is full frontal, sort of like the old 8mm movie lights,which were mounted on the front top of the cameras.If the director was trying to make it look like a home movie,then he succeeded.But, I think it detracted from the story, the characters,and made the film less watchable.
By portraying the I.R.A as thugs and then the British soldiers and R.U.C special branch as the good guys takes away any impartiality and leaves you with the same unionist crap about how the British were impartial upholders of the law in Ireland and the nationalists were all terrorists.
While the cop and the maid are chatting, the nurse's charge, a little girl, wanders off and then falls into the lake.
if you are Meg Ryan fans then i recommend to avoid this movie.
if your not, then avoid this movie as well.
But then there's Porky himself.
Chevy is great at dry humor and modestly scores with a one-liner now and then, but the film just doesn't make it as one of those good comedies that you'd like to watch every so often with a big bowl of popcorn.
If you are into that sort of thing then this movie is for you.
Disaster warnings start small and build slowly so that the "man" is not aware of the problem until almost too late and then must turn to the "rebels" they have been trying to suppress because they don't want a panic or interrupt the annual picnic or whatever.
OK then.
So then, rubbish plot, rubbish effects, awful dialogue and questionable stock footage.
If you're a fan of the show Mystery Science Theater 3000, then this bad movie is for you.
The woman who comes to investigate for the government just happens to be the ex-wife of the tunnel digger, and of course we run through the usual clichÃ© of them disliking each other and then getting back together over the course of the movie.
If all you want is a cheesy disaster flick, with a lot of unintentional camp, then this one will fit the bill.
Events occur in the movie and then the explanations play catchup.
If these friends are so telepathic, why would one have to answer a, and Im not making this up, a ringing gun...then talk trough it like it was a telephone!!
The begining starts off promising, it moves in to a beautifully shot hunting trip, and then pretty much when you get to the crap weasels and stupid looking alien its all down hill.
If you get to see it for free then please, by all means.
This movie starts very interesting and then, around the arrival of Morgan Feeman, becomes almost total crap.
I will not tell you what happens exactly because you can guess by then.
I kept thinking, "I'm just going to leave," but then I kept hoping that something would finally happen.
Thankfully I dozed off, but then, tragically, I started to snore and woke up again.
Well, the traffic jam goes on for maybe 30 or 40 minutes before she ever meets the man; I was squirming in my seat by then, but determined to see it through.
Like meeting someone one evening and then spending the night without knowing anything about each other, without even exchanging a few sentences.
Now, 36 years later, I've had a few strange encounters in my life (like anybody else, I guess), but then... so what?
Some of the characters were given dialog that sounded like it was copied straight from a community service announcement, then there was the plot which was so thin it was generally hard to find, and when the director seemed to be totally lost, he would throw in a sex scene.
So if you want to watch a movie that has some pretty cute guys (not all mind you) having pretty graphic sex while delivering bad dialog, then this ones for you.
After watching the Police academy movies over the years (those were not masterpieces, either, on the contrary), I was rather curious if this series was worth watching and if the jokes were good or at least somewhat better then those on the big screen.
But then, the out of focus shots keep on coming.
One thing these movies have taught us for certain is this, if you're brown and growing up in America, you have a harder time assimilating into the mass culture then lighter skinned people.
When it arrives, it makes no sense, and if ANYONE can understand the main character's point from his dialog at the "big speech" then send it to the production company for inclusion on the video jacket.
But then the movie would only run for a half-hour or less.
If u really have to watch a movie, then rent some old favorite rather than go for it.
So, if dumb, loud action films are your thing, then by all means give these boys a whirl, or rather let them give you one!
Well I am quite well read on this period of history.And unfortunately I don't feel this film portrays the period well at all,Tim Roth,as good as he is is other roles,was,in my opinion totally miscast as Oliver Cromwell..history shows Cromwell to be a strong minded,gruff,honest,happily married Huntingdon Farm owner who rose through the ranks of the army to become commander in chief,and who trained his army to be the best in Europe.Tim's portrayal comes across as a greedy,power mad weasel.I'm afraid if it is a history lesson you are looking for then watch 'Cromwell' starring Richard Harris (an excellent portrayal)..but if you choose to watch this film,then take the history aspect with a pinch of salt.I can't really imagine a statue of Mr Roths version of Cromwell being erected outside parliament and being heralded a great Englishman.
If you want to tell a story, then make it all up, but don't mess with historical fact.
If you are in the mood for a good laugh and some horribly good acting then look no further.
We learn about Ricky's brother, who the first film is about, then after half the movie flashing back to the first film, we get to know Ricky and how he became so psychotic.
And then Ricky shouts "Moooooo!".
They practically show most of the first film and then we get thirty or so minutes of Ricky killing people.
The film then all of a sudden turns into a real sequel, with a summary of Ricky's repertoire as a demented killer and finally results in a grotesque 80's cheesefest where he chases a nun in a wheelchair.
Well, it seems the mischievous Percy tied the rear legs of a dog together and then threw it into the middle of the lake to see if it could swim back to shore.
Sure, I could talk about the chiq-on-chiq faux-action, the wolvez barking at passing cars, the scenes taking place in furniture-less model homes (and then trying to explain it), the monosyllabic vocabulary, an interesting scene involving a guy popping a squat and so forth and so on, but it'd never really prep anyone about anything about this movie.
If this is the best movie parts Dolph can get, then even his straight to video career is going to be over very soon.
I rented this movie from my public library along with Beverly Hills cop 1 and 2.The first two were really great and when I was about to put it in I had a thought of 'how bad could it be'.Well the first 10 minutes were good but then all the comedy and good acting got taken away.I only became excited once when they had George Lucas has a cameo so thats not really saying much.
This then saw Murphy's stock drop again with the underrated but underachieving The Distinguished Gentleman... which is where Beverley Hills Cop III comes in.
The original has completely passed me by but if it's as bad as this one then I think I'll give it a miss.
If ever a film typified the Eighties and the flash-bang appeal of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer then, for me anyway, "Beverly Hills Cop 2" is it but this tired addition to the series has none of the charm or style of the early films.
OK, so here's the plot, a crack dealer in a ski mask and gloves gets annoyed at an under-cover cop, who's having an affair with another cop, so he kills her, then goes on to kill the other cops family for no apparent reason at all, then he takes off the ski mask (again, I don't know why)and decides to start killing teenage girls until the city pay him $1,000,000.
they do pay him, but he gets angry again and wants $2,000,000 instead, then he tries killing the other cop, only to get shot in the leg, I turned the DVD player off at this point.
The funny thing about FEDORA is how Wilder critiques old Hollywood and the then current Hollywood of the 1970s and proceeds to shoot himself in the foot.
She says she only knows a little of the language, but then suddenly starts speaking as if she speaks it fluently!
All airplane flicks tend to throw in the kitchen sink to fill the time but this may have surpassed even the spoofs in having a "and then what happened" motif.
How many times can the passengers rise up against the villains and then back down like sheep can you handle?
If you like to laugh at mediocrity, then this movie might do the trick for you.
And the toxic agent is alternately described as nerve gas and then anthrax.
Now and then one of those wonderful films comes along that is so terrible it's good.
A fear of flying group takes a ride in a plane with a bunch of terrorists with a bomb on board which then heads towards a storm.
Here's the plot: ----------  Here's the story: ---------  A careless "the-devil-may-care" french street bum keeps running around aimlessly through mostly train stations or airports, constantly being asked for his passport... then running again... and so on...
However, if you haven't played FF7 then it is likely that you will not enjoy this film as it's storyline carries on from the game without previous explanation and your likely to get lost from the plot even if you have played the game.
If you have not played FF7 then it is best that you play it first before watching this film.
clouds mentioned so much that it make you not want to see him in this movie   the villains have the award for the worst villains ever (i was more scared by the wicked witch of the west)   all the other characters in this movie are simply put in the movie for a nod to the fans and doesn't take it further then that  wtf's with the chilly chally???
This one was boringly classic - there were three fights with the bad guys, following the standard procedure (the hero, Cloud, gets smashed, then he almost gets there and gets smashed, and then finally wins).
If they'd managed to give everyone some significant story role (Star Trek: First Contact proved it was possible, I might add), then this could have been a lot better.
End Spoiler :P  If this movie was made for the fans, then way to go Square.
Well, the movie started out OK in the first 20 minutes, but then things get out of hand as the movie progressed.
Maybe if the movie wasn't so over the top, then the view relax into it and then they can be amazed by something incredible.
then cloud has his 100th flashback in the movie and then wakes up in a pool of lifestream.
The effects are bad, but you won't notice since the big bugs only appear in a cameo role at best...they're there in the beginning once or twice, then disappear until the "action-packed" finale.
What director dares to call his film "Monster from GREEN Hell" and then deliver a black & white movie?
The expedition first struggles through weeks of drought and dehydration and then subsequently weeks of unceasing rainfall.
IT took eight hundred and some pages to tell its story and then the payoff was so obvious and disappointing that I threw the book in the trash.
They cannot conjure a weak excuse of a job then claim that it shouldn't be compared to the original.
I put up with the characterization errors (the characterization that made the novel so wonderful) but then I turned it off when I saw that they'd made Valjean the mayor when he couldn't read or write.
Every single cliffhanger is re-edited at the reprise , the worst example is an episode that finishes with a tank that has the hero strapped to its front smashing through a wooden gate of a fort , a loud crash , splinters everywhere there is no way our hero could possibly have survived the impact - then the following episode shows ( !!!
If you have seen the Flash Gordon or Batman serials of the same period, then you know what to expect.
Vivek pleads with her then proposes to her, and they secretly get marriage.
Rani's character then goes off to live with her husband (Vivek) and things go smoothly for a while until they start dealing with issues that surround every married couple.
SRK then races to the hospital to see if the woman is still alive, where he pretends to be her husband in order to save her life.
Whenever a side kick would get more popular then Daryl he would kick them off the show.
He did this to Denise Drysdale because she was simply to funny, so anyhow he then decided to put blonde bimbos as his co-hosts on the show instead (they were really REALLY dim)  I will give the show credit for unveiling alot of talent on its RED faces segemnt (this was a segment EXACTLY the same as The Gong Show from America)but beyond that it was pathetic.
It is somewhat ironic, then, that the host's refusal to make changes to the format, in spite of requests to do so from everyone save the cameramen, eventually killed it.
By then, the show was rating in single figures, which is no small feat for a country that has only five free-to-air television channels, and still thinks impediments to its recording industry like Molly Meldrum are relevant.
Character's personalities change at the drop of a hat, and seemingly intelligent people make some stupid decisions for no other reason then to add some spice to the plot.
But no, we get the classic stereotypical gang of chirpy Irish hoodlums, a botched bank raid and then the bloody aftermath, which is where things really come off the rails.
However watching The Swordsman and then Gladiator Cop is an interesting exercise in picking up what you have seen already, what really belongs in the first film and why you aren't doing something more productive.
Kuki soon marries Paolo (Vincent Perez), and then, much to her mother's alarm, moves to Kenya, Africa.
30 years old then, Madhavan was so realistic in his portrayal of a love-struck young guy - physically and emotionally.
Shalini, being only 20 then, could easily showcase the role of a college student.
Towards the end she does come through a little better but, by then it's too late to save the film.
You will see one scene and then you will see another scene, and the two will have nothing to do with each other.
A some moments you feel like you're getting to know and like the characters, but then you get shot into a scene that is totally different from what you've just seen.
the man, paolo or whatever is going hunting or fishing all the time, so it's not really an ethical point for him...then what is it?
Vivek Oberoi is a student who sees Rani Mukherjee everyday on the train and one day he asks her out...They date and then decide to elope...When Rani's father finds out he disowns her and she moves in with Vivek...At first they are two lovers who love everything about each other and then the fights begins...the fall outs...the making up and then Rani is caught up in a accident that changes everything..
The acting is good as well and will keep you gripped...The sad thing is that this was a promising start to Vivek's career...and then he fell...I haven't watched a good film from him since..
Now I will say this; the weird guy with the camera, i think his name was lucky, got to see the girl topless and then recorded it on the camera.
later when one vanishes they look to find his video camera lying on the beach (farther away then he dropped it.)
to see something grabbed him, and try to figure out where Colin's brother went to, then the rest of the movie is pretty much a tale of terror where Javier and the girl with him (forgot name) get information about the past of the beach by a store clerk, where this man and followers lived on the beach and prayed to god for (I think) entry, they never ate real food just what the tide would bring in until one day he brings food and everyone devours it, then they realize he was bringing children from town, well they get man and do a horrendous act by placing him in the sand with his head out and cut his eyelids off while facing the sun, as he was there he prayed for help, but got the wrong religious man, but took the offer so he could take revenge on anyone who comes near his beach.
The start of the flight is bumpy because he steers the ship right into the maintenence bay, then he zooms right past the Endor moon and right into a comet field.
Then we help the rebellion blow the Death Star into oblivion then arrive safely at our destination.
So in conclusion, if you haven't ridden this ride before then my God, ride it!
Even then, it didn't work -- as a film.
But then, Kelly's every on screen moment seems to be "commenting" on her character's plight, rather than inhabiting that character.
Also in the cast are:Sammy White, William Ching, Aldo Ray and smaller roles for Jim Backus; the debut of Chuck Connors and yes that thug is Charles Bronson, then known as Charles Buchinski.
Of course, by then it's too little too late.
again i will vomit and then drop my t.v.
very clearly, then he says "excuse me?"
If you're a Sigourney fan then I think you'll be so disappointed by her wooden performance that her charisma and sheer physical allure won't compensate.
The film is dated (if nothing else was amiss with Half Moon Street then the soundtrack would kill it single-handedly), the plot is confused and boring, and the characters lack depth.
Drive In's showed these wild stupid 'sexploitation' flix back then.
I got confused and thought that the main redhead was dead but then she wasn't and it was just another redhead.
If you are in search for a good "bad" horror film with everything but the kitchen sink tossed in then you won't do much better than this.
This was especially relevant in South Africa, where Lesotho and Swaziland were created by then Cape governor Cecil Rhodes to hem in the Boer republics, and Botswana was created to create a barrier between German Southwest Africa and the Boer Republics.
(Read: "Rhodes: Race for Africa", by Antony Thomas)  The problem of the British state then became - how can we have these new colonies pay for themselves?
Skip it or if you must then wait for the video.
One consequence was they had to park the caravans a quarter mile away and then walk the actors to the set and also use a "simple" lighting rig to simulate a full moon which reflected light off the clouds and manged to cause a complaint from aeroplanes landing at Gatwick Airport 10 miles away!
You feel like you're watching a retro fashion show, as Cate models a wool skirt, and then a tight-fitting green sweater, and there she is in a crimson outfit topped with a beret.
This film recently surfaced on Channel 4.I saw it when it came out and thought it awful then and my view has not changed.What grates with me is the fact that it trivialises the role that many brave women played in SOE.Cate Blanchett is approached on a train.Well that just would not have happened.She seems to have been sent to France without a defined role.One minute she is a courier then she is involved in the blowing up of the train.She is constantly asking people for their names,and then if that is not bad enough she tries to find out about her RAF boyfriend who is hiding in a French village.Then she becomes involved in trying to avoid the roundup of Jewish children.None of this is in any way true to life.Watch "Odette" or "Carve Her Name With Pride" to find a truer representation of SOE agents in France.
If ever there was a pointless movie, then this is it.
Still in the carriage she then talks to a complete stranger who is obviously after personal information.
But then I suppose the screenwriter thought that really the Germans weren't all that clever.
Although being somewhat tedious, the story then begins to take on a vestige of reality, regarding the fate of two parent-less Jewish children and the resistance group leader's father who is also of Jewish ancestry.
If you aren't grounded in the reality of the movie's world, then the "magic" part isn't special.
At the very least, if there were people helping her stay inside the store and truly appreciative of her mystical skills (or truly dependent on them) then her conflict would have made some kind of sense.
Rani Mukherjee has done her part better then her male counterpart but I would not dare take anything away from Vivek Oberoi.
The script and direction are weak and did not hold me for more then 15 minutes.
The story of "Hellraiser:Hellworld" revolves around a group of teens who receive invitations through a Hellraiser website to attend a Hellworld party.They then find themselves in a huge mansion party with plenty of sex and booze.The party is hosted by the Lance Henriksen character.Then one by one the gang start to die at the hands of Pinhead and the Cenobites at the urging of the host,who apparently has a hidden score to settle with each of the teens.
So where is its weakness then?
Rani Mukherji then?
Gulzar then?
But where is then the problem?
There's also a couple of nods to SAW which like HELLRAISER started off as a well regarded horror film then became a franchise factory churning out sequels to lower acclaim and box office .
BUT if you're a slasher fan,then definitely see this one.
If you happen to come across it on the side of the road (which is quite possible due to the hatred I had toward this movie once I finished it), maybe then you could give it a watch.
It's one of those lines of dialogue that they always put into movies like Hellraiser 8 that are impossible to avoid sounding like they were written and re-written and rehearsed and re- rehearsed and then finally they just give up trying to make it sound natural after 30 or 40 takes and, exasperated, just drop the best bad take into the movie.
And then she did something stupid.
The story follows the death of their friend, something about that game, and then cuts to a few years later when all of his friends get invited to a party celebrating the said video game.
Better then INFERNO.
I'm all for keeping Cenobitic appearances limited, but then when you DO use them, for God's sakes, use them WELL.
And then they dragged it out EVEN FURTHER with a vanride and scenes from the police arrival at the hotel room.
3) Did anybody notice in the beginning that van had a European license plate while driving and then pulled up with an imitation New York one?
At first I felt sorry for Lance but then I remembered he was in Mangler 2 so he deserves what he gets.
They wanted to talk about some sexual taboos but then they distracted to some other topics by bringing in some utterly bogus plots.
First a daughter, then a wife, then a companion, then a sister, what is the director thinking of the audience.
And then the problems don't get solved in any event.
For some reason the story then becomes a work outing on Brighton Pier, but when everyone does get back, everything is resolved.
Some family is sailing at sea, the mother tucks the kid into bed then hears a disturbance from above, when she resurfaces and father is clinging to one of the sails by his fingers, in the clutches of a giant squid's tentacles.
In many ways the story resembles another Benchley story THE DEEP which might not be a problem as such but when you've got a film called KRAKEN:TENTACLES OF THE DEEP then a prospective audience is expecting a giant squid to be the focus of the story rather than humans .
It's all very predictable & isn't even unintentionally funny, if you really like these creature features, someone out there has to or they wouldn't keep making them, then you'll probably enjoy Kraken: Tentacles of the Deep to some extent but for those of us who are really bored of this type of film I urge you to steer well clear of it.
Would photographer Anna have talked to and befriended sleazy doctor Larry in the aquarium... and then married him?
If so then it has not transferred successfully to film.
When the film is boring and moves at a snails pace and you don't really like any of the characters in it, then you have a problem.
She did, however, have a connection to Java (then part of the Dutch empire), having lived there 1897-1902.
Most of the dancing took place in 1905-06, then the assignments gradually became fewer and worse paid, until 1915.
Some bits seem distant in nature & do not fit but then that could be just me.
If there aren't any other interesting topics that fascinate him, then his health is obscuring his vision & must stop making films, at least not his biography anymore.
I really envy non french-speakers who may then not be affected by the terrible acting (but the script is basically awful so the actors may not be totally responsible).
Yeah, and then some.
The story then serves as a strict remake of the first one, with Anthony trapping the doll in a case, cutting herself while trying to grab the knife when the doll saws away at the case, and then becoming possessed by the spirit in the doll at the end.
It's the skewed logic of a criminal mind that since they stole something then it is now theirs and they are justified in using any means to recover their property.
If you want box office like Alien, then act like it!
She is so ugly and nasty one has to wonder how the corporate officer would ever consent to having sex with her but then again there is no realism in this flick.
In a way, this film imitated his movie career: it started out fairly strong, but then had some difficulty being entertaining.
So, this is the best I could figure out: The government is evil, large corporations are evil, aids is killing blacks and whites don't care, (these are the easy ones) then I guess that Spike is trying to say something about fatherless black children which is hard to understand, then I guess he also has an opinion on sperm donation, but what is it?
It looks like some first-time scriptwriter couldn't get sufficient backing and then directed his script himself.
But then comes the latter plot-line, involving Armstrong's ex girlfriend (Kerri Washington, who between her character and Dania Ramirez's character are the most infuriatingly simplistic lesbians I've seen depicted recently on film), who will pay to get impregnated by John.
It's a tyranny of beauty then!
And then Ken Lay and Ellen and Portia De Rossi all live happy every after on Coney Island.
)-wasn't absurd enough, we then get a subplot about a mafia chieftain whose daughter is one of the clients.He must be the new kinder, gentler form of godfather as he seems to have no problem with his daughter being involved in this.oh yeah, the ladies are worried about disease so they make the main character get tested for everything before the big night, when he has sex with at least 6 women in a row.how do they know the woman went before them was clean?
anyway whoever the intended audience is they didn't find it.here in nyc, the movie played in 1 Manhattan theater for 2 weeks then vanished.
So then he goes home to his fancy apartment, which he can no longer afford to maintain, and then has to deal with the torturous proposal of impregnating lesbians at $10,000 a piece.
I can understand if Lee wants us to be aware of what he's talking about, but he literally stops his movie to put these stories up on billboards and then hits us over the head with them.
The story then turns into some sort of diatribe against corporate greed, against the blatant excesses of the Enrons and WorldComs of corporate America.
But the film then suddenly turns into a defense of Frank Wills, the black security guard who uncovered the Watergate burglary.
As rich as poor taste goes, yes there's boobs, bottoms and nodding heads galore but takeaway the sleaze, the flying bullets and the flash cars then all we have done is landed on the square that tells us to "Go Back To GO, do not collect Â£200...start again".
It is much more real, and deep, and interesting then any others.
The reason for such a low rating then is, I just didn't get the point of the movie.
The movie may have salvaged itself if they didn't try to also make the main character, try to talk like a ghetto person one minute, and then a respectable, sensible person the very next.
If this mismatched pair is actually from the streets, and have been through the Harsh Times that the title and the film itself suggest, then how can they act like such children?
The dunderheads in helmets who rush by with fixed bayonets are unable to see legs showing behind false bushes, so that's all right, then.
But then the film slows right down, and unfortunately it is very clichÃ©d and never really sparks.
I have seen much worse from lions gate, but then again I have seen much better.
However for those that like to see really really badly directed movies then there's a treat for you in the last five minutes of the film.
but if you do like comedy and medieval then  watch it if you don't like that just see if you like still i did not like this movie and wish it was never made!!!
this movie is about a man who goes on property and says that his name is Robert hood and stuff so then he ends up becoming a outlaw and is wanted and then changed his name to robin hood.
Instead, it rises to pure confusion and then into a visual beauty...
It could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film.
But can you imagine if someone had the wit to see what talent Bette Davis had then?
The final scene where Lloyd gets his just desserts is apparently based on a true story where a gang member had a dispute with another leader got on a bike, dealt with it and then pedalled off to a funeral to be a pall bearer!
This movie was really bad, I think that the title fooled me because I thought that there would be at least more vampire call girls and more of a vampire acting but what I got was a bunch of boring sex scenes including a girl straddling a washing machine while some goof with glasses watches through a peep hole, a lady at a club watching the most horrible band in the world play with a guy playing a guitar with only one note and then she takes him back stage, or vice versa and straddles the guy.
George Eastman House then came to the rescue when the inter-titles were found in their vaults.
You then leave and get to a souvenirs shop.
All of these characters occasionally pop up throughout the film, say a couple lines, and then leave just as quickly.
But then are you surprised when you see that the producer is Jerry Bruckheimer, (there is a lot of action), or the director is Joel Schumacher, hardly known for his subtlety in the past or for making films of a 'crusading' nature.
He lust after Sofia (Ulving), gets to have his way with her and then finds true love with another girl at the end.
This movie is kung fu crap.It's campy,corny,cheesy,and just appalling.Anyone who can enjoy the random,badly choreographed,slow paced,ridiculously amateur martial arts fight scenes is clearly off their rocker.The storyline screams bad and the plot barely progresses at all.The unbelievable cheesy storyline involves a martial arts student receiving a video game from his grampa in which he and his father get sucked into they then realize that in order to escape they need to beat all of the fighters in the game.Wasn't this on an episode of something like Kim Possible.Hard to believe but the film actually started out OK but after 15 minutes the film becomes a steaming pile of crap.The dialogue is like taking the dialogue from the Mortal Kombat Films,Power Rangers,3 Ninja's,and the English dubbed version of Japanese anime Naruto and creating a hybrid of them all.Don The Dragon Wilson sucks at acting just like the entire cast of this brutally corny film.Stay as far away as you possibly can from this direct to DVD piece of garbage rent something better instead don't waste your time.
And then there's Cynthia Rothrock, who goes around dressed in clothes that look 25 years too young for her.
The businessmen, having no understanding of western culture or basic common sense then proceed to strip off.
In the end, not much happens the big naked ride never really materialises; it looks like it's about toÂthen just turns into something that looks like a documentary shot by 17 year olds who've got their mums to play members of the crowd.
If you can't get the climax right with this kind of thing, then you have no movie.
The film then, I would only recommend to die hard lady Godiva fans or girls/guys on a awful blind date, as their is a perfectly acceptable excuse for leaving early.
I'm starting to think Garland must have just watched his favourite movies and then blended the plots together to create something he passed off as his own.
Sunshine would make a good book but it made a god awful movie...Garland should write it as a book actually, then write another one and then another.
I liked it at first, but then I started thinking.
This movie really just consists of a problem, there's a solution to this problem, however as a result of that solution another problem occurs, this is fine until about the 6th problem or so, and then you just get a headache.
If you watch it more then once in (for example) a month, then there's something obviously wrong with you, and you should seek counselling.
That said, I'm pretty generous when it comes to reviewing movies, I can normally look past problems and just get a few laughs, or shocks, or whatever out of a mediocre move and then be happy.
Even then they were "neat" but nothing to write home about, and for those hoping for a fancy flashy colourful special effect when the "Plot Device" activates at the end, there isn't one, seems you just can't win.
If you've seen them then avoid this one, as they're much better films (yes even Event Horizon).
If, there is no radiant heat source present, then an object will radiate it's heat without gaining any in return until it's all gone.
"; then he removes from their silly huge open vat of cooling liquid the ship's preposterously big computer components and suffers not the least touch of frostbite-- even though frostbite fatally mauls the poor schmuck saddled with the task of re-dunking those components.
If you've knowingly seen a Tarkofsky film then go and see Sunshine - you're bound to be able to find some spurious justification for why it was meaningful.
The crew then decide that they'd rather be in "Alien" than "Solaris" and go to investigate.
Thoughts: If you hire a physicist to act as a consultant on your film, and if your screenwriter concocts backstories for your characters, and if you house your actors in bare-bones student digs and send them up in airplanes that permit them to experience zero-g, all so that they feel like "real" astronauts, and if all that consulting and all those stories and all that experience don't end up on the screen-- i.e., if you expect us viewers to mine the film's websites for this science and these tales-- then you as a filmmaker (that means you, Mr. Boyle) haven't done your job.
And then the acting...Oh my God, even wooden puppets could act better then all those people together in this movie.
And then the acting...Oh my God, even wooden puppets could act better then all those people together in this movie.
I give it 4 out of 10 because of the music and the curiosity value, but there always is the album and then again there are some movies best left unseen.
; the resolution, then, sees a happy ending for the Count and his companion â while Frankensteinâs well-deserved come-uppance is amusingly delivered over a game of pool by Merlinâs own hand.
), and even then with a caveat; my advice is don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.
Our pure-hearted heroine is unconscious in bed one moment and then necking in the shadows with Naschy the next, madly in love with him.
It'll start out a normal day on the farm then that annoying bird will come along and say 'I'm a chicken hawk' a hundred times.
The film opens with a completely irrelevant rock-climbing scene and then deteriorates.
If you're interested in the ideas of the film then read Crichton's original "Andromeda Strain", although the plot of this version is actually closer to Sagan's "Contact" (more investigative, and perhaps even more worthy than Crichton's).
Anyway, movie plots back then were a bit different (gross understatement).
", fainting, crying, anger, ANYTHING -- but all we get is a blank stare and then Gail trots off to bed, and the parents just stand there.
If this is the kind of movie to which our children turn for entertainment, then I'm scheduling an appoint with my urologist first thing tomorrow morning for a VASECTOMY!
Burton plays Clare Blake, a policewoman promoted to the top of her profession, despite being so lacking in judgment and self-control that she risks destroying her own career by jumping into bed with a convicted killer who is under investigation for another two murders, then conducting an affair with him in full view of her colleagues, the press, and the public.
If you have never seen it, then avoid it.
Maybe if I was not younger than most of the cast members who are trying to pass themselves off as teenagers then I would not have had a problem with this film.
If that was all it took to make a good movie then everyone would be doing it, Waters has a visual style and a wicked sense of humour.
I have probably watched it once a year since then and I don't think its lost any impact.
Now if they would give participants five HUNDRED dollar cards and had them buy the best clothes for the lowest cost, then I might understand.
Andrew Walker is very cute and sure there is a twist, but since you now know there is a twist you'll be looking for it and then it's not that surprising.
It then moves to his sold-out stand-up concert, where his monologues are alternately explicitly crude, arrogant, racist, and sexist.
Every now and then, he says, "don't take this too seriously, it's all a goof", akin to what Eminem occasionally pulls during his fits of rage.
The DVD also looks like it was copied from a VHS tape, rather dark, and about three quarters of the way through, the movie suddenly backs up about 15 seconds like someone accidentally hit the fast rewind button, then goes back to play.
I'd say this is only for nostalgic adults, and even then I can't really recommend it.
It felt more like an essay than a movie; rather than chronological development it was as though a point was made and evidenced and then moved on to the next point - I much preferred the chronological growth of the characters in the series.
The kidnappers then try to outsmart one another to get the money for themselves.
A particularly bad scene is when Donald Pleasance is telling someone something, and then they cut the scene and he finishes the sentence several minutes later!
But when you're shooting a stylish crime thriller and trying to tell a decent story, then you better fine-tune your directing skills in that department too.
Dolph Lundgren stars as Jason Price a NSA agent who after losing a witness in his protection agency investigates the leak and finds out that there's more then what meets the eye in this mediocre thriller which is definitely a nice looking feature but the plot is just too hard to follow making this for Dolph Lundgren fans who will ignore the plot and just enjoy the action.
After enjoying the freshness of the original Pusher, then Bleeder was alright film overall; although it was hailed as a big advertising flop here in Denmark.
But then what do you expect from MTV!
Well, not even then, really.
The little cur would lower his head and sink his front, then raise his butt in the air.
And if Confessions of a Window Cleaner's protagonist, young Timmy Lea, was at all typical, then being a demin-clad, rubber lipped minger was no barrier to scoring more hole-in-ones than Tiger Woods.
The first half contains meaningless squabbles between the gang, and then we get into other situations with little point to them.
If gore is your thing, then this won't upset, but if you like well written dialogue, then don't bother).
At first they don't like one another, then he finds she is actually a sweet, nice girl inside.
If an action film is better than Die Hard, then it deserves to be praised for that achievement alone.
if you want to get a better idea of what this movie was really trying to say then read some of ther loved it posts there's some good points.
And then we have the ending.
If you are distracted by the art house aesthetic and use of cinematic and audio editing techniques and don't agree then I'd like to present the classic horror/slasher/suspense scenario for your consideration.
The scene is then played out in a now grim way, leading to an ending that is so "original".
It allows brutal things to happen, then indicts us for wanting to see brutal things happen.
And then, once we feel safely distanced from the horror, Haneke yanks us into it by having one of the characters look right into the camera and address us.
If you take someone's brain fluid, and then inject the brain fluid into your bloodstream (intravenously) then you might have a heart attack when the heart cannot filter the brain fluid, but I do not see how injecting brain fluid into your arm is going to cause anyone to relive the memories of the person whose brain fluid was injected.
Times have certainly changed since then.
And then, one of the main characters actually goes through this experience... and doesn't die!
From then on, alas, this movie turns into a cheap TV horror movie Âone of the cheapest genres ever existed.
Sutherland  is usually screaming as his superior for the umpteenth time, then  rides out into the woods and is shot at...again and again.
But there was still enough to keep me interested, and I thought that if I could see the problems of Season 2, then surely the writers could see them as well.
There are many flaws with the script, but off the top of my head here's one: They build up Adam as this super powerful/influential guy and beside the healing ability they don't even explain how, and then he gets easily killed to make room for the next big villain.
It instead, informs the viewer five-ten episodes in advance what the finale is going to include, and then it plays out exactly as you expect it to.
The legendary cliff-hangers it supposedly delivers are annoying, as you might've been getting into a scene finally (the last ten minutes is the only thing worth watching) then it ends.
Next week, you've lost interest and when it returns, it spends twenty minutes recapping what happened last week as the show seems to think it's viewers have the memory span of a fish, then the exciting discovery to see whether or not a character is dead or not (which you could really care less by then) is finished and the party continues at a lagging speed, until it repeats itself over and over again...
Nikki also became popular with the men, probably because of that lovely crotch shot in the first episode, so they continued on her dull struggle to keep from becoming her alter ego, take care of her son and to not go to jail, when they finally put her in there, she murders some couple guards or something, and then... they release her!
And then of course, Hiro.
All those valuable sword lessons by his father really payed off, since Hiro now understands that with a sword, the best fighting technique is to point the pointy end of the sword towards your opponent, and then run toward your enemy screaming until you impale him.
He won the Academy Award for Patton (1970) and then he made many proclamations about how Hollyood sucked.
The final sequence does provide one really good jolt which is quite unexpected but you may have already fallen asleep by then.
When he made the sequel "When A Stranger Calls Back" some 14 years later he had another superb opening sequence (even better then the original's) before it fell apart the rest of the way.
So if you rent this movie, my advice is to either not watch it, cause it is really a pretty big waste of your time, or to watch the opening scene, and then fast forward to the ending scene.
And then the real horror starts, the stark, soul shattering horror of watching a movie with a memorable beginning sink into a morass of banality.
As for Carol Kane, she does a good job playing the eternally frightened Jill Johnson but then promptly disappears for a large part of the movie.
If sending your pastor or mom an email every time you look at a dirty website isn't merely a way to shame you out of looking at porn, then what is it?
So then the plot is pretty predictable, he plays great, makes an NBA Team, and helps a bad team to a better record.
There was a time when Franco at least tried to make entertaining movies - always sloppy (he'd shoot lots of loose footage, then resell/repackage the same stuff to different distributors under different titles); but this is even worse than Lust For Frankenstein - just a cheap amateur whack-job shot on camcorder by high school students.
Some people gave it a chance, then fled after seeing how worthless it was.
But then he kept doing religious material, which seemed very odd to me.
I wonder why the actors did not tell the director about altering some of these scenes, but then, if you're going to have Justin Long cast as basketball stud, I suppose no one either cared or was paying attention.
Well that just makes the whole movie then!
But then you have to ask "What is a 9 year old girl doing locked in a cell with a bunch of 18 year old crackheads?"
The film then really starts to go into its own as we follow an average police officer from New York in LA trying to just to get home for Christmas, still more about this film.
When the terrorists find out that hes set the fire alarm off from the top floor they phone the police and tell them that its nothing to worry about and send someone up to kill him, John pleased with his attempt to get back up there looks out the window and swears at them for coming to his aid, then notices they turn around.
If they made more films like this then people would probably remember what cinema is about and we may have really memorable hero's like we use to.
This film should be a benchmark for ever other film that is out there trying to be an action film with a strong story, lets face it on paper it's a simple story terrorists want a building for money, they take it over, then John gets caught up in this mess...it's not hard really.
But then maybe people like it because it's simple, however I think they like it, or i I like it because it's so original and has never been done before, even Die Hard 2 and 3 they push the idea of films harder and further than before.
I'm sure too many people will read the same reviews that I did and waste a couple of hours of their lives watching this quasi-mystical piece of trash, but I can hope that anyone that reads far enough will pause and then pass on this horrible, pointless movie.
And if you are one of those many people who have only ever been able to watch it on TV then now is definitely the time to rediscover a cool, classic and creative action picture.
The main character uses his supervision to see two tiny cuts on her bone that the pathologist then needs a microscope to see!
One episode (Gemini) the lawyers pipes up 'wait we need to talk' to his client, but then says nothing and allows his client to speak.
If it was me and my dad I'd push that detective down a flight of stairs then take a steaming dump on his head.
I rarely see really bad movies... because no matter how bad a movie is, I always try to overlook the flaws and focus on the merits instead, then it becomes a not so bad movie.
If you can over look all these little things and others like them then its a watchable flick.
Perhaps it wasn't entirely her fault, as back then female romantic leads, especially in action movies, were often written as weak, wishy-washy, sobbing, super-sensitive emotional jellyfish.
The Detectives where at the PD checking his moves by a satellite transmitter installed on his truck, and while the Detectives where talking the older one said they must let him go into Amber's so that he confessed to her his crimes, the younger one reply him and then suddenly the older one says they must caught him before he get her, contradicting himself previous parliament.
I watched this on TV a couple of months of ago and then recently after the trial was over, I watched it again because a friend of mine had a tape of it.
Watched the original Men Behind the Sun, and then this sequel.
Why they need to research what happens when they do this, I don't know, but anyway, the hero reluctantly fires at the commander's order, naturally killing them, then looks shocked and horrified at the results.
Terrible continuity, too-in one scene, a guy bites into a small corner of a guards earlobe while fighting, then we cut (they always cut away instead of going to the trouble of showing any sort of effect) to a shot of the guy with a huge chunk of flesh in his mouth.
If you want to be bored, mad at yourself for wasting your money, and have your intelligence insulted, then rent this one.
And then there's Andy Warhol's Dracula.
When Hulten and Jones first meet, he invites her to pick out a well-dressed woman whose fur coat Jones fancies, which Hulten then steals for her.
The film gets this detail right: Army lawyers deposed Hulten, then chose to give him back so the Home Office could try him in Crown Court.
I expected the bobbies to twirl their truncheons and mumble 'Here now, what's all this, then?'
then, others seemed pointless.
some red-eyed alien briefly appears outside, and then an alien spacecraft flies overhead and causes his drink to bubble away to nothing.
If its his brother's, then he'll write it.
This is the girl that paralyzed the side-kick girl and then proceeded to fondling her underparts then had sex with the guy she was keeping captive, beat him up had sex with the main bad guy went back to the prisoner guy and then had sex with her lackey then her lackey gets offed and then she sacrifices herself... so we're supposed to feel what exactly for this character?
Without giving any spoilers...if you can watch an anime about a retard with big breasts fighting in a tournament oriented series about feuding school districts, then this is the box set to buy!
If Hanes or Fruit of the Loom needs a new spokesperson, then any female in this series will do...overdone panty shots every 30 seconds is a bit much.
Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.
If, as other reviewers here have said this is how Africans see themselves, then is it any surprise African films don't get much exposure in the world market of cinema?
They go in search of Captain Kidd's treasure - find it - and then I'll be darned if they don't go in search of it again.
Maynard overwhelmed Teach's fleet with firepower, and personally defeated him on deck of one of Teach's ships, then paraded through the area with Blackbeard's head dangling from the bow of the ship.
Most of us know that even then, an island could not be purchased for $1000.
Sorry I lied Blackbeard isn't "the next best" at anything, the pirate that was at my third birthday party was more of man then Blackbeard.
I would rather play in a radioactive waste dump then endure another 160 minutes of this piece of trash.
I lasted half an hour and then I just couldn't stand any more.
A basic understanding would mean knowing the name of the ship he's associated with the most (Queen Anne's Revenge, which was a French ship he captured and renamed), he's associated with the then English colony of North Carolina among other places, that the governor of the colony of Virginia sent Maynard after him because the governor of NC was to friendly with him.
because if that's the case then I retract my statement.
When the father passes away, there is much mourning, and then when the mother arises to use the bathroom in the middle of the night she encounters a VERY strange character that literally scares the life out of her.
And then there's the kindly doctor who is puttering about the garden who suddenly is attacked and ends up at the bottom of the well, only to realize that it seems to be himself that put him there?
The small cameo with David Carradine is OK, Carrie Chambers is well endowed, and then there is SNAKER.
The film under review, then, is original to be sure and mercifully short â but also rather pointless...to say nothing of dismal-looking, dreary and thoroughly depressing!
There are several moments where something like this will happen: a character will fall over with no bullet wound, there will be a close-up shot of a gun firing, then another view of the dead character (now complete with gunshot wound to the head) in a totally different room than the one that they died in, in a completely different position!
It's shocking when junk like this gets made- there have to be one hundred worthy scripts out there that are better then this.
I actually feel a little bad reviewing this because I feel I'm only advertising it somewhat...like a lot of people curiosity got the better of me after reading the reviews...I have to say though it's a work of genius from the director to film a LOW low budget film and then come on here and deny he knew what the final cut of the film looked like...that had me on the floor...what great directing that is...
Did I mention the novel weapon is a toy crossbow that is vastly less menacing then the hunting crossbow on the promotional packaging?
If this movie was supposed to be suspenseful, was supposed to have a killer stalking from house to house by means of rooftop, then the movie should not have taken place entirely at the middle of the day!
If you can get past some of these ridiculous premises, then some scenes in this movie could probably be really suspenseful.
If it took more then something is wrong with the cast.
It was nice to see Satana up there on the big screen again after all these years (but then again, I wasn't around for the first time, so why not just rent another classic Satana flick and leave this one behind?).
whenever she claims she was abducted by aliens, then there's some George Carlin-lookalike doctor who teams up with a psychic or something, plus Tura Satana (from the first Astro-Zombies movie) and her dimwit henchman who looks like Vincent D'Onofrio from MEN IN BLACK who hope to cash in on the invasion.
The film then seems to randomly cut back and forth between the many subplots, and the same zombie keeps waking up in the alien spaceship a total of about five times.
This one's more like 20 minutes of killing, 20 minutes of aliens, and 30 minutes of characters talking to each other and looking confused, then 15 minutes of cars driving around and various other random stuff.
I was always taught that any narrative, be it a movie, book, play, even a piece of music, has to have a beginning, a middle and an end - this dreadful excuse for a movie had a beginning...and then it waffled for the next hour or so until the woman we sort of guessed was the heroine, ran off into the night.
I got confused and thought that the main redhead was dead but then she wasn't and it was just another redhead.
If you are in search for a good "bad" horror film with everything but the kitchen sink tossed in then you won't do much better than this.
if you ppl don't believe wat has been written then check out this link.. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157571/.
Soon, her former lover Â who happens to be the doctor's twin brother who was abandoned and then raised in the slums Â comes back to claim what is his.
And then he decides to live off tax payers' money like a parasite.
Richard Riehle starts out like everyone else wondering how he got into this mess and how to get out, but then gets brainwashed to down to Shore's level.
Adding to it all is the plot which I'm told takes the Rampo story as a jumping off point and then spins it out with new complications.
This is the first thing I have seen from Salome Breziner; if this is any indication of Breziner's style of writing/direction, then I'm not in any rush to see anything else.
Kerr and Johnson then proceed to spend lots of time together which is most unlikely to be achievable.
And we need the scene setting at the beginning where Holmes and Watson divine the character of Dr Mortimer from his walking stick, and then Mortimer's telling of the story.
It then got worse.
If we was beating people up to get answers then he would be a pretty dumb detective.
but if that's the case, then why are we here?
Perhaps that's part of the problem then, because in every film version I've seen (save, perhaps, for the Jeremy Brett Granada one, where the hound looked as though it merely wanted a Milk-Bone and a nice tummy rub), scriptwriters can't resist the temptation to add dubious "improvements" to Sir Arthur's masterwork.
No denying, then, that another opportunity to adapt this hoary Holmesian chestnut went straight to the dogs.
Now, if it were true, then the movie would have been better, but you only see about 3 minutes of her in the whole movie.
You see her in the very beginning and then through a series of flashbacks to the beginning scenes, but the the ninja is NOT her.
Since then, I have tried to see as many of his 50 worst films--and TROUBLE MAN is about #35 for me.
If you like seeing a bad mutha killing mobsters with his .45 again and again, then you are in for a treat.
A quack then supposedly cures her, she marries and then things get worse as she has a baby that gets sick and her husband gets it to.
At first it was good, but then it got boring.
Really, I've heard of sequels killing a franchise, but this one guts the franchise, then neatly prepares it for Grandpa.
The pacing consists of a 5 minute opening, a 20 minute introduction to the characters, then a 50 minute climax.
The scene then devolves into an even more embarrassing fight between the characters amid rather perplexed diners.
The women--tho pretty--don't get wild for the first half hour, and even then it's only 1958 wild, which is to say tame enough for afternoon TV.
And then, somewhere in the late 50's they made this movie to laugh at us and mock our mating rituals as well as our religious beliefs.
And sex back then was pretty much the same as now: First you kiss, then you do the bongo-bongo.
And then the ending...
Unbelievable... And then there is one more final shot of that annoying talking parrot, and the movie ends... GRRRR... Will somebody please SHOOT THAT DAMNED PARROT!
Wango, as well as Goona, were islands created by Mother Nature back some 10,000 years ago where the men of Womgo were boorish brutes and the women were gorgeous babes and in the case of the people on the island of Noona the men were Greek Gods and the women were homely wallflowers.This made dating romance and marriage among the young couples of Wongo and Goona an act of duty rather then an act of love.
If you're a fan of these horribly bad movies then this a treat, but good luck finding it.
The film tries to rely on it's "jokes", which are no better then fart and poop jokes.
I watched about 30 minutes of this film and then turned it off.
I suppose if that is your sense of humor, then it will go over very well for you.
And even then, I wouldn't suggest it.
I mean, Wilird wasn't great but it was better then this.
Even then, the parody element isn't that strong.
It was something like "If you ever download sh*t like that again, I'll blow myself up"  I really want to tell something more, but the only thing is the warning that this movie is more damaging for you then smoking.
If you like films that are intelligent in their parody and genuinely funny, then stick to the Scary Movie catalogue.
Too many indie directors take a concept and some creative ideas and then simply relegate the acting to the lowest priority possible.
By that 4th time, Fargo is barely trying - he merely taps a door into the bad guy and then starts slapping him around like a wet noodle.
The accountants haul the good doctor off to a toy helicopter stolen from a Godzilla set, then transfer him to a model submarine swiped from the Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster set.
They then blow up the toy helicopter, like a five year old gleefully setting off a bottle rocket.
And then Bart demonstrates how incompetent he is, letting the thugs drive the car over the cliff.
The 'death ray' causes a lot of wallboard and plaster to fall on their heads, and then there's a scene in yet ANOTHER hotel room of Bart and the red-haired artist chick he saved from 'certain death'.
Since then, I have not liked any of Robbie's work.
If you want to see a music video where a sleazy drug addict rips off his skin to impress chicks, then go ahead, watch this video.
The police then investigate and interview all the cocaine snorting friends who last saw the man alive and think they may have a suspect, but there's a twist in this struggling plot.
If you like your movies sappy, then this one's for you.
Imagine three of the least interesting and most melodramatic plots you can concieve, and then cram them into one movie that manages to bore, confuse and disturb all who view it, and there you have it.
I felt as if i had been drugged and then subjected to several hours of beatings and disorientation.
Anyone who sits through this film should have the opportunity to slap anyone that was involved with it, and then be slapped themselves.
He was also a troubled soul with a horrible family history who murdered his wife then took his own life.
The film was shot on location in the Ukraine, and presumably to keep down the budget, all but two speaking roles were filled by local Russian actors whose voices were then later dubbed over by uncredited American actors, often quite poorly.
Virtually everyone else will be more compelled to watch the opening credits lovingly worship O'Hearn's form, then promptly return the film to wherever they rented it from.
I took ice skating lessons to help alleviate some of the frustration and then went back and applied some of the knowledge to my skating.
If you can tolerate the near hour and a half of convoluted yammering of the characters (because that's all there is), then you'll probably be able to get through it.
If I am correct, then I guess the purpose of the movie diminishes considerably, and its philosophy works against itself like a boomerang.
We meet someone in a convenience store for two minutes, get a picture of their life, formulate some questions about them, and then, poof, they're gone, and you never know what happened, just as we never know what happened to the boy who runs down his mother, the couple who weren't on the guest list, the roommate who disappears, or any of the other characters in "Slacker."
Follow a group of slackers interacting with each other and then cut away to new group when new passerbys come on-screen.
when i saw the trailer to this film i had high hopes and then when i found out that Mark Jones was behind it i figured it would be good i loved the first leprechaun but even though the trailer was good sadly thats about the only good thing about the film, it trys to hard to be funny and you just start feeling sorry a quarter of the way through asking yourself why am i still watching this maybe it might get better I've seen it all the way and let me answer that question with a big no.
this is like a bad sequel around the lines of leprechaun in space, but i forgave that movie simply because the first one was good but this on the other hand you cant forgive it trys way to hard at times and throws a little blood and boobs ur way every now and then to keep u watching, a part made me smile close to the end because it was simply a scene stolen from dead silence.
This was made to cash in on the then hot roller disco fad.
An abductee, running through the woods trying to escape a crazy shot-gun toting, crazed maniac, then all of a sudden wow -- there's a saloon -- what luck!!!!!!
If you enjoy "Horror/Comedy" movies that contain absolutely no horror, and lame comedy scattered few and far between, then Triloquist is right up your alley.
If you want a good "evil doll" fix then check out something that at least tries.
Gee if that's the case Genius then why are they the best sports franchise in history?
It was as if they had budgeted exactly an hour of tape, so everything was done first take and then all this nonsensical stock was added.
No and I mean NO major sections of the plane were found other then one of the engines( 100 yards away from the hole) and later a few larger scraps ( 5 feet to 10 feet, no larger) .
If this was a fictional story, then Stephen Segal would kick everyones ass and all would end happily ever after!
I am going to view the film version and then formulate an opinion.
If America is the richest, most powerful nation on Earth, as they are fond of saying, then where is all the money going??
It was also so stupid that the plane was shown going out of control only a few hundred feet over a farmer and then crashing.
The cellphone calls were vital on Flight 93 to get the details of the "hero" legend across, which would then be used by the Pentagon as a recruiting campaign for invading Iraq.
The opening scenes of the baggage inspectors being so thorough was a bit contrived (apparently they were doing a better job back then than they do now).
But, we get this long boring story about these three main characters that seems to have no point, except to draw your attention every now and then to the campus killer, who conveniently cuts into the act (no pun intended...i guess).
But later, possibly after another day has passed, he manages to get up and walk all the way home and then scold his daughter for not being in class.
They pause, then say their stupid line (and I can't decide which character is more ridiculous--Brian or Paula), then we have another awkward pause, and so forth.
I saw this film many years ago and had trouble sitting through it then.
It's so easy to to watch this and then tell everyone within earshot that it sucks but the truth of the matter is that anyone expecting to view a good film is lying.
The main problem here is that it tries really hard for a funny bone and then it would turn all serious, but it just doesn't come off with the right results.
This and the paint on him that appeared and then disappeared due to bad editing make this an odd and confusing picture.
He bemoans this by scolding the portrait he had apparently painted of the man earlier on and then getting drunk and angry in a bar, tossing out patrons.
There are continuity errors with horses (the stagecoach has four horses, then three, then four again-from shot to shot!)
Terrible acting and dialogue are unbelievable at first, and then steadily turn to laughable.
Alrighty then....
These people have NO imagination at all, the plot is just plain stupid; just think about this: it's been 2 months since the nuclear bombing and nobody knows what's outside their own town - Jericho, almost every scene is indoors and the characters don't do anything but to talk and then talk some more.
But then again: the leftwing have killed more people than the rightwing - The rightwing exist of Hitler (killed 10 million Jews, Gipsies, homosexuals and communist), Mussolini (probably killed 2 million, Ethiopians, Greek people and political adversaries), Franco (1 - 2 million communists, socialist and other) and Pinochet (1 million of all sorts).
The only person I saw interviewed in the film's entire 1 hour and 45 minute length who was credible was Pete Williams, now a network newsman, who was then the Defense Department's press spokesman.
How would I grade this movie?As a horror film,it fails completely.It never provided me with one scene of anything resembling horror,or fright.If it had been a satire, I might have given it a 3,but if it is satirical,then it is only accidentally so.As a comedy,it would get a 2,but I think the things I found funniest,were things the film maker wanted me to take seriously.So I have to stick with a one,but only because there isn't a lower number to give it.rp
And the ending which is all too unreal as this crystal ball full of old spirits gets thrown down and breaks and then the rain comes down and everybody turns into melting wax dummies.
They then melt away ala Street Trash in the church which then explodes.
Despite him being about 70 and giving them every chance to get it back, he still manages to smash the TV thingy and then all the evil folks start to melt like they are made of gallons of colored latex.
Together, they cause some more sherbet leaks, then break the watermelon.
Maybe they should have played this like a fantasy cuz then maybe it would have at least been somewhat entertaining but the only characters who is even worth watching is the gay guy and Daryl Hanna and thats it.
If you have to watch a movie about male hustlers then watch "my own private Idaho" or maybe "johns" which is not great but a much much better movie than this piece of crap.
If you're not looking for a vigorous story of similar circumstances like say, 'Where the Day Takes You,' then Speedway Junky is a good weening toy.
If you know incredulous Hollywood movies, then you should already expect Johnny to go through a lot of crap, but some how wind up with a happy ending in the end.
Johnny and Eric get into serious trouble when Steven steals another kid's stash of drugs and money, and he isn't the kind of kid you just say sorry to and then treat to ice cream.
"); episode 2, 'Premonition,'; episode 5, with his daughter Pat, but which is really a twenty-two minute version of his film 'The Lady Vanishes' (1939) and is called 'Into Thin Air,'; this episode 7; episode 10, the amazing 'The Strange Case of Mr. Pelham,' with the goofy looking Tom Ewell, but the episode may have won an Emmy; the performance of Barry Fitzgerald in the 12th episode, 'Santa Claus and the Tenth Avenue Kid,'; episode 17, 'The Older Sister,' with a strong performance by Carmen Matthews; episode 22, 'Place of Shadows' with Mark Damon and Everett Sloane; episode 23 'Back For Christmas' with Hitch's main star, John Williams, also directed by Hitchcock; episode 26, 'Whodunit,' with John Williams and Amada Blake; the anti-drinking episode 30, 'Never Again,' with Warren Stevens and Hitch's anti-drinking speech; episode 37, 'Decoy,' with Robert Horton, Cara Williams and Frank Gorshin, and then finally, the great 'Momentum,' a 22 minute film noir with Skip Homeier and Joanne Woodward.
Happily we are spared from the peek-a-boo nudity that is typical of these films: where the director goes to great lengths to get the actors naked then hide their nudity through awkward posing, clever placement of props, and so on.
OK, how can you go wrong with no less then 3 Scream Queens in the flick?
First of all, the action doesn't even begin to start until about 30 minutes in, that alone wouldn't be cause for alarm, but this is an 80-minute B-movie, so that's more then 1/3rd of the film dedicated to lameness.True the girls remain topless for a good deal of the remaining film, but, aside from a good lengthy bubble bath scene, nothing you can't see in any other of their respective movies.
There are more cars in this film shot at then any I have ever seen.
Back then, they'd have been talking into bricks, y'see.
Sure, the story's opening hints of romance when the world was young, but then can't decide if it was ten or a hundred thousand years ago.
OK, the movie has some naive and primitive charm, but I guess the main reason for making it was to show a bit more feminine skin then the regular movies would allow.
The costumes look more like sleeveless fur coats then the clothing actual prehistoric people would wear.
His typical explanation involved a bomb under the table: if it explodes out of nowhere, then that's surprise.
Basically Abe Dale (Nathan Fillion) has his wife Rebecca (Kendall Cross) and son while eating lunch in a restaurant, when they were shot by a man who then shot himself.
The movie starts off with potential and then horribly crashes.
Also, why would ONE person saved from death need to then go on and KILL MANY people?
However, If you want an easy to digest, bland and average horror flick then give White Noise 2 a try - but like myself, expect to walk away disappointed.
This Tammy person talks about how she got to know Pandora's Box when she went there with Lance, then seconds later announces there's a rule that you should come alone the first time.
This is a failure on so many levels, it could have worked with a better screenplay, better director, better actors, better cinematography, and even then just barely.
It involves a cold blooded businessman who fires a long time employee and then chastises him for his tears.
They then limp around until the scene ends, and then forget that they're supposed to have broken limbs.
But then their injuries suddenly return when the plot needs them to.
And then they zoom out and show the whole forest being engulfed in flames.
The supporting cast are little better and well before the end one was left hoping the fire would engulf them all then the film crew.
But then suddenly it struck me.
There are plenty of movies one can enjoy by checking ones brain in at the theatre door; but when a movie cloaks itself in a supposedly complex plot and encourages the audience member to engage his or her brain, and then doesn't even stand up to scrutiny, I find the whole process deeply depressing - more so when the film takes itself as seriously as this one evidently does.
If you are a big fan of the television series, starring Peter Graves and Martin Landau, like I am, then you will hate this movie as much as I did.
If you can get beyond these prejudices, then you can expect, at best, a mediocre movie.
And then various members of the new team he puts together turn out to be traitors.
And then at the end of the film they completely trash the reputation of TV's greatest spy master Jim Phelps.
It would be like making a movie adaptation of the A-Team with Colonel Hannibal Smith turning into a bad guy, killing the rest of the team, and then having a totally new character not in the TV series be the hero of the movie.
If you're just looking for a big-budget remake of a Rambo-type movie, then go ahead and see this movie.
But if you're a fan of the Mission Impossible TV series, then don't waste your time on this crap of a movie.
The two kids go from her being hostile to him and then having sex.
This film is not so much bad as silly, almost as if the story was made up on the fly by giving each actor a piece of the puzzle and then telling them to wing it to see what happens.
Nothing is shown when the shrews attack someone and the first ones to die are (of course) the black guy then the Latino.
I was in high school then and thought it was silly but fun.
And as for you -- you'll just be some unknown smuck who'll pay to see it and then write an IMDb user comment on it like I...like...oh,well...NEVER MIND !!
The Swedish doctor talks about overpopulation, but Rosco tells him that he isn't worried about overpopulation at that point in time, then Rosco kisses the Swedish doctor's daughter.
The acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for TV flick, but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times.
The general concept is compact and dramatically efficient: a group of people are trapped first by a hurricane and then by an outside menace in a stronghold which gets less and less strong as time, ammunition and group cohesion all grow short.
To really get into a movie like Serpent and the rainbow, I think the subject matter just has to be interesting to people to enjoy this, but even then, I think many will have problems because it is simply to hard to follow and many parts don't make any sense.
Since then Like looked forward to watching Mr. Squarepants.
It was a terrible scene and I stopped watching the show right then.
And then, there was the episode where Spongebob and whats-his-face were cursing and it wasn't revealed.
I think we paid for something else and then snuck into this theatre.
And then, after she splits in half and all the characters are on the run from the big, bad killer, the guy in the Stifler role ends up in the killer's barn looking in his fridge for a tall, cool one!
It wasn't too bad but i have seen so much better, you can bet i wont be watching it again, once was enough for me, needed more gore, then maybe it would have been a little better, but it really mainly needed a little bit of originality, it was too much like other slasher flicks like Texas chainsaw massacre, wrong turn, hills have eyes... the same movie over and over again gets kinda boring...but it would probably be an alright movie to watch once, but there is no way that there could ever be a reason to watch this more than that.i give this movie a 4, but it could have gotten better had it had a little bit more gore and originality...... ......... ......... ........
OK obvious over-the-top characters, frat boy, lesbian's, lonely guy, black token actor and female lead, was this script pulled from the are you smarter then a 5th grader.
4.even as obnoxious as frat boy was not even he should have been so callous as to be concern with the car then his friend being cut in half.
When i was watching it at one point i though i was watching, wrong turn, then i star thinking about the Texas chainsaw massacre, then hills have eyes and finally i know what you did last summer, the movie it's basically a mix of all these other movies but unsuccessfully did what those other movies did, it's just so predictable, the scrip it's so weak and far beyond scary, instead of that it's so lame, with this thousands of clichÃ©s like "don't go in there" "what it's this place" "he's gonna kill us all" you basically know who's gonna die first and why called it "the butcher" there is no butcher in the film and there is not even a good slaughter, they should have call it "i know what the Texas hills wrong turned last summer" or something, honestly i don't know what a company spend money into making this crappy films.
Then, only then, there would be a chance of success.
During the first ten minutes you'll find yourself hoping that the bad guy mops them up quick and then goes to Cancun for a vacation with some margaritas and maybe beach babes.
Was a big question in my mind now even Rishi Kapoor feels the same in AALC which is very bad  I mean please the superficial way of showing America puts people off and in today's overseas audiences dominating times this isn't good  The first half moves in different lanes and the love triangle is done to death  and the second half gets better a bit Akshaye's realization is well handled and then the film ends well but the sudden change of the other son is too much  They are many problems in the film like the first half which moves in different lanes and not proper treatment is given to most of it  Rishi Kapoor directs some dramatic scenes well but he needs to improve his storytelling, overall a decent debut by one of the finest actors as a director Music is okay  Akshaye Khanna shines in his role, He was always a good actor but signed bad films those days Barring his receding hairstyle he leaves a huge impact as an actor Aishwarya is plastic as ever Rajesh Khanna is okay Kader Khan and Jaspal Bhati are good Satish Kaushik is funny Paresh Rawal is good
Also, if you're an Olsen twins fan, then of course you're going to love it.
If she doesn't, heaven forbid, want a man, then she's an evil temptress and must die in the end.
If it's true that, according to other reviewers, the movie truthfully adapts the novella of Lawrence and his opinions, then it doesn't say any good about Lawrence's work either.
He unperturbedly returns to the farm despite Ellen's letter saying that she doesn't love him and can't marry him, and even then, he doesn't ask, doesn't wonder.
She then writes him that it's all off, after a cozy little female smoldering with Jill.
The makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character, with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the children's father is especially clichÃ©d - and then when they're back on BLAMMO!
What isn't welcome is how "The '60s" drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect (and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post-60s America never mentions the British Invasion - no Beatles, no Rolling Stones... then again, there's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album, right?).
And then there was this ancient secret note written backwards... And in perfect English!
The movie begins with someone being murdered in a French museum, and there then follows a unbearably tedious 'detective' trail with people having murderous intent and the hypothesis is Jesus had a wife, children and there exists a present day blood line blah, blah, blah....
By the halfway point, I had this film in my liked column, but then it just went on and on and on, in fact, even though I have left the theater, I still think the film is running.
If Mary Magdeline is to the left of Christ in the painting, then where was John?
Every scene seems to be on the verge of delivering something exciting and engaging, then falls lifeless to the ground.
And then I read a comment that this mini-series was "great" and that the user couldn't understand why this was never shown again.
So then I went to idea "B" - that the movie was just a really bad drama.
You would then subsequently expect for the "Demented Death Farm Massacre" to ensue, but no Â First there's a lot of arguing about the difference between stealing a jeep and picking up what other people threw away (seriously, who "throws away" a jeep?)
Though the acting was good, (then again, how could you go wrong with that cast) the story absolutely sucked.
And as you also can obviously guess,he's done nothing since then...that we know of that adds to much of his resume.
I thought Christopher Scott Cherot was the next Spike Lee, or John Singleton...if he continues like this he will be as memorable as Mattie Rich, and if you don't know who he is then that's what I am talking about.
This movie had a slow start and I thought that it was going to get a little interesting in the middle and then it had a weird ending.
... but then, what else would you expect from Michael Winner??
Bella then takes advice from an Iranian clairvoyent ( As I'm sure anyone in her situation would do ) then it's revenge against the penis people all the way   As you can imagine I had this sussed out as a role reversal of DEATH WISH but about two thirds of the way through the entire tone of the movie changes when we're introduced to " The lady in red and spanky fat boy " .
The story then dovetails into a scene where she gets a genuine desire for an obese man (Michael Cule, awful) with breasts and lets him take her from behind.
A sophisticated exchange then takes place after he accidentally places himself up her anus, then loses his erection.
This movie started slowly, then gained momentum towards the middle.
The second part really got interesting, but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending.
It purports to be about Ireland but unless you believe that Darby O'Gill lives with the little people there is no credibility whatsoever; could have been made 50 years ago and even then would have been crap.
Live through it and then make comments.
If there's any story that demands talking animals, then it's this one.
I remember then that I thought it was utter rubbish.
If you haven't read Clive Cussler's imaginative, but right-wing thriller about a gigantic defense shield that will protect America, then you might enjoy this soggy saga.
And then, in this post-coital scene, he starts philosophizing about law school AGAIN.
See them all, then hesitate before renting Honeydripper.
That says it all really Lets be honest - if you have 3 brain cells or more, have enough understanding of English to know that batman should actually be two words not one, have an intellect equal to or better than a nematodes, and a musical taste beyond thinking my My Ding A Ling was a good rock song, well then you'd have a more stimulating experience watching Thomas The Tank Engine!
All it was, was Pixar lamp watching his little child lamp play with a rubber ball for a minute We see a lamp hit the ball and then hop along and then jump on it.
and then the camera switches to Nicole who see's her phone ringing and is like "It's Paris."
In my files I have (the translation of) an article written by Kenneth Turan in 1979 which contains an interview with the then 55 year old Carolyn Cassady.
In the very beginning we see the president being shot with a dart then the next we see a woman talking on her cell phone.
The whole thing with the virus being airborne and then the general cutting a hole in the containment shield which contaminates the whole area outside of the hospital.
Then the brilliant general decides to blow up the hospital because then the virus would be gone.
But what really would happen is the airborne virus would then be able to travel farther because the bomb disperses particles over the area.

I could name you all the stupid things about this movie but then I would be telling you the whole movie.
I would never recommend this movie to anyone unless you have to watch and even then I am still sorry for you.
If you want to watch a good movie, get Scarface, Godfather, or Anchorman, but if you want to get a good laugh from what's supposed to be a serious movie, then i suggest you give this a look.
I would like to think that the people protecting the president are a little smarter then that.
Now I don't know that much about Ebola but I do know that it does more to your body then just give you a bloody nose and a cough.
Now I can see this film more then 1 time each day !!
The ending was annoying, first with her cutting only one of the straps on the tunnel and it expanding and then when she made the last second phone call.
It was cute then.
He was still cute back then.
It seriously looks like some man just took his home video camera and filmed two kids staring at each other in a van and then every once in a while threw in a clip of a shiny knife with blood.
Considering it only runs for 80 minutes it feels a lot longer then that.
I've seen a lot of blood work they have done and it is so much better then this.
).He comes back from the war and changes in a "Tom Cruise Born on the fourth of July" look a like and then into a Hippy.His dad is a pro-vietnam war type of guy(what a surprise!!
But, having explained away preceding events by invoking a mad professor and then wound up his story by an 'and then they all went back to their previous lives' scene, the film-maker then commits the cardinal error of pressing the reset button -- or in this case, throwing the freeze-ray switch yet again.
Two basic things changed our world then: the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the overwhelming influence of the media.
phase, then maybe, just MAYBE, something even remotely watchable could have come out the "Hale Manor Collective"'s efforts.
Like Trading Spouses, the families are completely different, but the problem is that instead of simply having the wife living with a new family the show tries to start a fight by getting each wife to read some sort of manual about the other family and then after a while to set rules.
He stood on the edge of the pipe for a while, and then just FELL in!
I saw the first half of the film then gave up because this looked to me DOUBTFUL.
When the shuttle attempts an RTL (Return to Launch) abort, they do a nose over, a half a barrel roll and then attempt a turn to starboard....uh, with the external fuel tank still attached and the main engines firing.
When they do jettison the external fuel tank, the main engines continue firing for time and then later shut down.
And then there's the ditching in the ocean, and the shuttle sinks to the bottom.
And then when her husband climbs into a mini-sub and drops into the shuttle at the bottom of the ocean - all plausibility is completely gone!
Then the Mexican becomes a moron and neglects her friends, and then everyone's happy at the end!
if you're a shallow low-life crackhead who thinks fashion and acting like a bitchy slut is what life is all about, then this movie is for you.
The food fight scene was creative at start then was very funny.
The acting was not award winning but the girls otherwise did alright...except for when they had to show any ~real~ emotion other than thoughtless glee; then, they failed.
the storyline jumped all over the place, beginning with the girls entering their freshman years, then all of a sudden it flashes "two years later", and we're supposed to believe they're juniors, even though they look exactly the same and have no physical change whatsoever.
If the intention of writing this film was simply because the last time a movie has been this cringe-worthy was Britney Spears' Crossroads, then the idea was a nail hit directly on the head.
Although the drama is of course not the most important part of a musical comedy, if it does not help to motivate the songs and does not create any suspense about what will happen, then the audience is just tapping its feet waiting for the next musical number.
(Note to script writers: If you really have to put "OMG" as an actual spoken line, then I think it's time to rethink your career) After this monstrosity finally ended, I looked to my friend and we looked to her sister, who then informed us that the movie was horrible.
Seriously, if you want to ruin someone's birthday, then I recommend Bratz: The Movie.
My little girls liked this film, but then again they are 3 and 7-years old.
These dogs are no more likely to fight then any other dog and dogfighting has only been part of breeding programs for the last 200 years.
If you liked that dreadful Matthew Perry/Salma Hayek movie from about 10 years ago, then you'll probably be able to sit through this one.
If he can't, then it would take them more than their lifetimes to get back to where they started.
Until then we're stuck with this AWFUL, TRITE, APALLING, HORRENDOUS, ODIOUS, REVOLTING, HIDEOUS, LOATHSOME, REPULSIVE, IMMATURE, NIGHTMARISH, HORRID PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!
If it was the former, perhaps then we could ignore the huge plot holes.
We then get quite a beautiful piece of music (with a twinge of eeriness to it) playing over the interestingly-filmed opening credits, featuring the fungi.
She then hallucinates the bloodied cut-off tip of her finger boiling in a glass of water.
Iris then meets a shoe-shiner, who compliments her shoes, but warns her that keeping them on all the time will lead to the possibility of losing her feet.
She then spends some time with her employer down in the bathroom, where they have a light-hearted moment of calling out, letting the sounds of their voices echo.
She then tells him the story of how she lost the tip of her ring finger.
Well I first saw it on the Sci-Fi channel, then a few weeks later uneditied on Showtime, its much better on showtime, becuz then at least there is some nudity.
Anyway, then the robot chases the woman who wanted the cigarettes and blows her head off in the film's grossest effect.
If you expect a bloody, graphic horror film with machines slicing up humans and then neatly stacking them up in cupboards, you'll be sorely disappointed.
Or if this is the best of French films this year, then just how bad is a bad French film?
When it eventually does (after what seems like an eternity), you only see the first 5 seconds of the sexual encounter then you fade out to the aftermath.
It starts of very stiff, no kissing, he just takes off his trousers and "does it", then stands up an puts them back on.
This is a pathetically dreary film about a "gang" of drug smugglers and their not-so-funny misadventures as they are hounded by the Georgia State Patrol while first in a beat up camper and then a huge rig.
First Born starts slowly and then...becomes even slower...and then Zzzz.
The whole time I am waiting for something to happen and then....nothing.
I had no idea or could have guessed what the outcome would be...   And then a truly awful ending which ruined what originally had me gripped.
The Pulitzer Prize board has refused to reconsider Haley's prize, awarded in 1977 - in what former Columbia President William McGill, then a board member, has acknowledged was an example of "inverse racism" by a bunch of white liberals "embarrassed by our makeup."
Good acting etc but the script dragged at times and I would have liked to know more about the other characters that came and went.Who was the character that was shot and then nursed by the boy?
It becomes a gay action movie, then a gay horror movie, with a classic, is he behind the curtain?.....Nope.
Then it gets even more dragged out, lots of sob moments for the ones shot, then some gay music at the end to wrap it all up.
So overall very gay, I was honestly hoping that after the gay beginning it would start to redeem itself, and it did... but then it came back with heaps of gay that just plain ruined it.
This movie starts out as an over the top slapstick effort, but then bails out on that and gets surprisingly serious.
The first 15 minutes were pretty cool, but then the next 20 minutes were deadly boring.
Mathis is incredibly hard to watch as it is, then when she shares scenes with all of the above it just makes her look BEYOND FOOLISH.
If this is what television believes the world if like,and what people would vote for, then you wonder why David Cameron is bothering about image change.
If you were to cut an hour of this movie you might have something a little bit entertaining, although even then I don't think you'd have anything memorable.
Some of the transformations are entertaining, but even then the movie rarely rises above the ordinary.
This big but empty film version is the story of a widowed matchmaker named Dolly Gallgher Levi, who has arranged a potential mate for a wealthy Yonkers businessman but then decides that she wants him for herself.
It's been a long time and truthfully, I had my reservations about the show even then.
If that's true, then the film was handicapped before it even began by bypassing Channing in favor of a very young Barbra Streisand, playing a character fifteen or twenty years older than she actually was.
Anyway, Nero plays a bitter loner who, having lost his wife and kid in a traffic accident, voluntarily enlists for dangerous missions for an unspecified organization but then, unceremoniously, quits his job and relocates to a Carribbean island whose seas harbor the carcass of a sunken plane with a fortune locked away in its safe.
I don't really know why I should go on writing in detail about such trash (especially since most of you probably won't ever have the chance to see this for yourselves) but, then again, why not?
At first I found some of the weak points to be frustrating, but then the whole thing quickly became laughable.
If you've seen the entire movie then you have a better constitution than everybody gives you credit for.
), his dead wife, his amazing tactile skills, (apparently he can come up with an idea and then just make it)some badly casted parts, a 5 minute speech to cure insomnia and you've got yourself a blockbuster... in Melbourne, Australia.
I think he starts off as a cockney, then lapses into an American accent and finishes off as an aussie!
You see, were it not so, then this blight of a film, this cancer, this celluloid diarrhea that crept into my eyes and ears and then sat and festered upon my brain, forever burned into my memory, would never have happened.
The producers of this film apparently saw the Matrix and a handful of vampire films (though I believe this shlock actually predates Underworld) and thought to themselves "Hey guys...let's take these ideas and then throw them in a blender with feces, slap it in front of a camera and see what happens."
It also had a look like it was filmed exclusively using security cameras, which gave them an extra bit of annoyance as one moment you can't really see what's going on because you're too far, and then the next not seeing it because the camera is shaking like mad.
I assume he does, but I wish he didn't because then there wouldn't be even the possibility of this movie getting a sequel.
My advice is to see "Serpico" for the place it holds in Pacino's career, but then see "The Insider" for a suspenseful, terrific movie.
I saw this movie about fifteen years ago, and I was shocked at how horrible it was then.
She lives with them then, one is a drunken Great Dane and one is a Collie who thinks an old boot is her dead puppy.
They get into tangles and fights with other junkyard dogs and then eventually wind up in the pound.
I found it very different then the previews made it out to be and at times it was plodding, as well as being very confusing as well at certain points.
The previews were also very misleading making it look different then what it actually was.
There are bad movies, then there are truly bad movies.
This is for British audiences only - but if I tell you that this film also stars Christopher Biggins - and he gives an almost academy award winning performance compared to the leads in this film - then I think you will start to comprehend that this is a complete waste of 91 minutes of your life.
I just pray to God that there isn't a sequel, and if there is, then PLEASE do not release it 'straight-to-cable'.
Jewison used it sparingly in The Thomas Crown Affair (1968), and it annoyed critics even then.
If you are a fan of any of the actors/actresses in this film, then you may want to watch it, simply to "add it to the list".
Even warfare was a more 'formal' and 'dignified' affair then than it is today.
I have already lost some respect for the Academy after giving Russel Crowe the Best Leading Actor for Gladiator, but if anyone from this movie wins even a nomination, then the whole organization is full of it.
In this way then the plots don't work anymore, it lacks logic, it's hard to get the motivations of the characters.
But this one is a weak effort, with far far too many minutes of silent angst/introspection by the four leads interspersed by either Han Ji-eun or Lee Yeong-jae storming out of the house they share and then returning for more.
)appear now and then to prod them on.
But if a viewer is to accept the setup as being true, then the stranding in a foreign country and the loss of home, money and all personal property is tremendously sad and tragic.
Our 'hero' and the two girls then get taken captive by some evil miners.
We flick back to our 'hero', who is casually sitting back in a chair smoking a cigarette, as we hear more bullets being fired right at the girl, then finally he decides to push the detonator painfully slowly to blow up the remaining bad guys.
this film released in France under the title of "Prisoners in the valley of the dinosaurs" is a mixture of adventure (Indiana Jones was quite popular then), erotica and cannibalistic violence.
This film started promisingly, and for about the first 35 minutes was full of riotously funny humour - but then, it appears that the scriptwriters just ran out of the ideas - So what did they do?
If American Pie is a 100, then this one gets a 2.
I've always considered myself as a big fan of British comedy but then comes this movie to tear my illusions asunder.
I must admit that i was'nt looking forward to watching this,But to my surprise, I WAS RIGHT,This is probably the most stupid,idiotic load of crap that i've ever seen.If you can stand countless erection joke's(well one joke done a hundred time's )then this is the film for you,All of the joke's are forced upon you(AGAIN&AGAIN&AGAIN).
They give Hamilton and Pleshette top billing and then list the rest alphabetically, giving you the impression that there will be an ensemble cast delivering something of significance.
And then we have poor Miiko Taka, wasted again trying to make something of a bit part way below her ability.
He has psychedelic experiences there, nearly gets killed when the merry-go-round goes out of control, but then leaves.
He looks like he's going to drown, but then opens the convertible top, swims to the surface, where the car is still bubbling like a fishtank aerator (no sign of any bubbles a minute ago during the underwater shots) and swims away.
Also, it gives a musical performance every now and then in the movie, making it also a musical genre.
But even back then this particular movie stroke me as not being a very good one.
He hangs there for at least a day, then gets angry and kicks the cross down he's hanging on.
I explored that the realism within was quite lacklustre, with reference to when Van Damme's character escapes from the crucifiction cross - then began a mighty fighting scene, which was highly disappointing to the viewer.
If you are a B movie advocate than you MUST watch this as a learning experience, if you are a Van Damme fan, then you MUST watch his for nothing else but to greater your JCVD knowledge.
If you're a real cinema expert, looking for a great scenario and nice shooting techniques, then you can avoid watching this film, it will make you mad for sure !
But if you like 2nd degree humor, if you love stupid fights, sounds, sets and so on, then this film is definitely worth the try !
Although there's an odd inclusion of Jesus on the cross in some scenes in the background and then you another sequence with Van Damme.
to sum this up if you like watching people be stupid and run at a flash of light or a odd shadow then watch Most Haunted.
******* crappy spoiler *********************  Well basically the bad guy is on top of a train with the protagonists daughter suddenly his sister who died (as you find in the opening sequence) appears, which was pathetic, I mean for a while we thought he was some ghost then we realize he's really a man but now the movie has gone back to ghosts?
If you can stand some blood and some guy in a sea monster suit pretending to hump a lifeless naked female for a second, then this is your film.
Anyhow they really could of made much more of that aspect of the film then they did.
And even then they conclude that it was probably just the fish.
With this he survives for a week in all sorts of different climates, situations and then hikes out lugging his equipment.
Teacher then breaks down said barriers with some "forward" thinking alternative teaching methodology.
But then it descends into random dance lessons and struggles at home with the kids.
If you're serious about investigating this nonsense, then just go here: http://www.skepticalanalysis.com/ If you just like it as entertainment, sort of like professional wrestling, that's fine, I suppose.
If science can't explain it, then obviously it must be PARA - NORMAL.
I would love to go on one of these haunted missions because I could debunk everything right then and there.
The host then proceeds to do what he must to survive with what he has available, and to make use of or anticipate a use for what he is left with, be it a damaged bicycle, plane, parachute, backpack, etc.
But then again if someone isn't rescued from being lost in a few days, then their chance of survival diminishes dramatically.
So then my complaints really are minor and perhaps frivolous, since this remains among my favorite shows on TV.
Before watching the film I saw the very high IMDb score (but forgot to look at the number of votes) and was expecting to sit down to a cult classic, indeed the first 2-3 minutes set the scene with a suitably art-house feel but then.... oh dear.
How and why it's situated in the present, and even more so, that its story got through the datedness that bogs it down is a mystery, but then again, Latin America is still in a mire of its own ultra-conservative values -- men are supposed to be macho; women who take charge of their own life are seen as little more than "zorras" in heat, and everything happens in a very hush-hush way.
Much of it has nothing to do with its denouement, which to a degree may even then be somewhat forgivable.
And then, to round up the usual clichÃ©d suspects, we have the nonthreatening, flaming gay guy Boris (Bruno Bichir) who offers secret, breathless advice to Zoe while confessing, around deeply effeminate giggles, that he finds her husband 'very hot'.
As folks from New England are prone to say, if you don't like the weather, then wait a little...and so it is with Les, who's circumstances change as quickly as Mt.
It's still a very interesting movie though, I'd rate it a lot higher then this if dialogues and acting was better.
I then bite into a river reed and break my teeth in half.
they lost their estate and all their money, and ended up living back in the area they were living in for Rocky I. I also could not believe how Rocky's son from Rocky IV looked about 8 years old when Rocky left to fight Drago, and then when he gets back, his son in Rocky V, (who is Sylvester Stallone's real-life son) looked about 13 & dorky!
Paulie then taunts Gunn but gets beaten up.
Rocky then agrees to fight Gunn in the streets.
And then, Rocky V. Another Rocky is always a pleasure in my view, but the movie could've been better!
I like the idea of the sadness that he ignored his son by paying loads of attention to Tommy, then tommy went awol with george duke, but at least he could have had Apollo or Creed's manager(I forget the name) train him for one last fight in the ring, and then beats tommy gunn, wins the title, and wins back his fortune.
Silent Scream then goes into flashback as the story which leads to this event is told.
They question Scotty, Doris & Jack but get nowhere, they then decide to investigate the Engels family to see if they can dig something up on them.
But then, so is Vegas.
It was nice, it was intriguing, but then it went too far.
If you got hooked on this crapper then stop watching it.
If you want to waste your time, then watch this one.
As it stands, the only one of these people I would even allow in my house would be #6, and then only because I am intrigued by that glowy thing she does with her spine during intercourse.
She's pretended to be asleep so the boy could sneak in and give the old man some of the medicine he needs most right then.
It shows in the not-too-often, not-too-little use of the term "buddy" between Starbuck and Apollo and Boomer and the trio handclasp colonial warriors use now and then at a difficult or dangerous moment.
Sorry, but if that were true and kids were that wise then they would never need any adults around.
The stark set, brilliant use lighting and sound make this a movie that keeps building until the final moments then leaves you wanting more.
Heading west, reformed outlaws Emmett (Scott Glenn) and Paden (Kevin Kline) become a band, first by springing Emmett's wild brother Jake (Kevin Costner), then by getting saved from a posse by Mal (Danny Glover), crack shot with a Henry rifle.
But then "Silverado" descends into clichÃ©, bouncing from rustlers' hideout to stampede to showdown in mechanical fashion.
As close by as in 1986 to be exact Â and then much better due to those who remember.
No incident room was ever set up, but then I didn't see many police around to actually use one.
Albeit modern forensic science has advanced out of sight since the 1950's, initial proceedings were surely much the same then as they are now.
The characer "Wet" has a faded scar in one scene; a few scenes later another character is commenting on how she just got a bad scar on her face from a beating, then, minutes later (days later in movie-speak), her scars are all red a fresh, even though she had them way before the mention of any beating.
If people see this, and like it, then more will be made just like it.
First night of the Bloody apes, second Curse of the Doll people & then Cemetery of Terror.
These elements were very Halloween like in their approach with this in the beginning but then this idea seems to dissolve as we get to meet the teens that will resurrect him and finally to another group of young trick or treaters that end up facing off with this Satanic fiend.
I really liked how this movie started as it looked like it was going to have shades of Halloween with the directors own little twist added however the movie, which starts off slow builds up for about a good 10 minute killing spree (nearly 50 minutes in, ZZZZZZZZZZ)then the movie veers off into weirdness as it turns from a satanic killer from the grave movie to an all out zombie film..thats right an all out zombie film.
If you feel that way, then get "Veggie Tales" or other selections.
Why are these embodiments then at fault, when these traits all exist in us?
is the dictionary definition of those scenes  Wait 'til this comes out on DVD and then DON'T RENT IT!
If it is an allegory for modern American society then I'm moving.
the quality of the film then immediately reared its head in the following 'child wakes up from nightmare' scene...  (possible SPOILER, but of the most minimal kind)  Aragorn/Viggo Mortensen - 'did you have a bad dream Sarah?'
so her and Aragorn get busy on the stairs in an odd 'what's going to happen' moment, then he's sitting in the bedroom, she comes out naked, closes her dressing gown and runs away in disgust.
Unfortunately, that has more to do with how bad some current filmmakers are then any particular quality WITCHTRAP has.
She made a few decent flicks, then wallowed away her career in a sea of these cheeseball no budget snoozers.
But then it quickly turned into a typical Hollywood production, with a typical for the "progressive" Hollywood left-wing agenda, which can be summarized very simply as: the UN and the International Court are noble and good, and they matter.
He gets the job at the hospital, okay that's simultaneously interesting and funny, but then what happens?
There's a really bad scene where four people play two pianos at a party - it just goes on and on forever in the most unrealistic way, and then you realize that the whole interminable scene was constructed to set up a punch line that is only mildly amusing.
If Mike Flanagan can keep up this level of invention then I look forward to further entries.
Moreover, the picture just freezes at a random point, while the counter keeps running, then the disc ends (cuts off, rather) a minute or so later.
The Mistress then chains Masturbating Woman's wrists.
By then, it would have taken something really special to create some excitement, but predictably; we are only served more disappointment.
After this, they arrive somewhere else, and then somewhere else, again and again, just for more unexplained violence, without any other plot, explanation, or transition between these episodes.
Eventually, one of the women drops something, and when he bends over to pick it up for her, she pulls him to her inner thigh and then starts screaming out that he is advancing on her without her consent.
The other women rush over and start hitting him, then sexually abusing HIM, all the while shouting at him to stop raping them.
He then does a round of roulette on himself and survives.
*** SPOILER*** Charlie's family has a psychiatrist on-call, and he's bamboozled the Dr. (who went to medical school and psychiatry school but somehow was never warned about manipulative kids) who lets Charlie describe fake symptoms and then prescribes drugs for Charlie, who then sells/distributes the drugs in school.
A teenager's fantasy about standing in front of his peers, being successful and leading the way - and then getting shaken out of his reverie by a teacher.
If you're gonna make us set through GOD-AWFUL acting then at least give us something to keep us occupied...like umm i dunno - a damn story perhaps.
It started off so good, then they got to the house altogether and man did the suck start flying.
Any comment with more then 2 stars is definitely a fake comment to trick people and boost it's ratings up so it wouldn't be the worst rated movie on IMDb.
This film is an amateurish rip-off of "Jacob's Ladder" with some bits of a Night gallery episode thrown in (the one with Roddy McDowell as a man who murders his rich uncle and then cowers in his house as a haunted painting depicts the victim returning from the grave to wreak vengeance).
This movie should be in the FREE box, so then I could take it just to burn it.
If the objective was to make the worst movie of all time then this movie is indeed a success.
I hope the budget for this stinker was kept at under $100; if not then the producers of this garbage should sue the filmmakers for their money back.
Do not just pride yourself on the ending because you are going to have upset people like myself that could tell that you spent more on that then you did the rest of the film.
If you like to watch movies strictly for the cheese factor and horrible acting, then this is the movie for you.
If you want to see a bad break dancing movie, then check out Breakin.
It basically follows 79-84, as if it were just, "Oh then we got a track on the charts, then we went to a concert, then we did some traveling, oh then we did some more shows, now we're big, then we released a couple albums, then a few more shows, now it's over."
And maybe one of these days when I'm extra bored I'll watch chapter 2...that is if I haven't used the laserdiscs for frizbees by then.
I mean, there's bad, then there's REALLY bad.
And all the time wasted on chasing a guy on a bike, then drop him from a helicopter.
But then it all ends.
And then at last; a climax as exciting as a flat tire.
However watching The Swordsman and then Gladiator Cop is an interesting exercise in picking up what you have seen already, what really belongs in the first film and why you aren't doing something more productive.
If you are a movie buff then you know George Lucas is the daddy of films and this just proves it.
I went through a burst of nostalgia, bought a copy off eBay and then actually received/viewed/listed it back on eBay within two days.
You then see a beautiful crosscut from somewhere in England, where Robbie and Dylan goes into a labyrinth of tunnels to - (scene 51) being from the castle Kronborg (of Shakespeare's Hamlet fame) in Elsinore, Denmark.
I saw them again for the first time since then around two years ago and i have been hooked ever since.
Very early on, for those looking for her, she is seen in 1/8th profile for less than a second and then holding on for dear life as an open ended wagon bounces along the dirt road with her and her daughter in the back.
I know it's wrong to compare the two, but if the filmmakers intend to make money using someone else's material, then they should expect the comparisons.
Hardy's novel traces the rise, fall, then rise again of a powerful, cantankerous individual.
When Hope first reveals herself to Daniel with the rosary beads, there is shock - then nothing.
It would blare out of nowhere and then abruptly stop.
Then they had to go break free and then get saved by the "retarded janitor"??
In the first hour this film plays out like a comedy/ western and then suddenly it turns into a drama/romantic/action western.
If you make movies just for your own "artistic" pleasure then why even bother releasing them?
If the director wanted the younger cross cultured audience to empathize and associate with the three kids then he got it horribly wrong.
The b-cast is more then decent when you see the names involved.
But then again this is a Larry Cohen fan speaking here.
Every now and then, I suffer through watching movies made by a group of severely UNartistic and UNtalented people.
If this is the case then why does he kill everybody.
If this accident was so traumatizing, then why do his parents wait til the 4th of July to take him out.
Little does he know that he is getting a little more help then he bargained for... All and all a decent segment, it does fall a little flat in the shock department.
Although I doubt it is much longer then either of the other segments, it seemed to drag on forever.
Id rather watch a real cat sleep then watch this stupid cat wander into another Stephen King short story though, so go figure.
If you want to watch a good cartoon then watch the Ren & Stimpy show.
It's much better then this slop.
So if you haven't seen rocket power or any other modern nick toon then don't bother.
As the hero, Adams is no Errol Flynn, but then he did have his hands full with producing this epic, right down to sinking his own dough into the handguns and the muskets.
At times you could barely hear the people talk, I had to constantly turn the volume up for one scene, and then back down for the next.
I've seen both versions, 1939 and 1954, more then once or twice.
Stewart could play a role low key and then show a range of emotions when called on to do so - he was a true artist in that regard.
If Nickelodeon actually makes more shows like this, then they are screwing up the minds of the next-generation of kids.
Nickelodeon used to have great shows most of the time (mostly during the 90's), but then all that changed with Butt Ugly Martians appeared.
If it had lasted any longer than that hour 20 minutes, I'd have stopped it right then and returned it never to pick it up again.
To my surprise and liking I find a gem every now and then.
The dialogue was laughable.....then there was a scene where they find a dead body in the school (everyone screams and then walks away).....then they decide to go to the teachers house so they can perform a sacrifice (?
And maybe not even then.  
The film begins with a woman realizing she needs to spend time alone because she's been having "difficult times" (so we can later explain why she thinks she must be crazy when she sees things), then the big house inherited from her dead aunt (low angle shots here, with blue lights behind dead trees, a la Amityville horror) and a bunch of bad acting locals who act unkind to this lady almost as if just because the script calls for it.
What then?
And then, there's this weird gentlemanly dude who shows up to court her in an old-fashioned way...
The plot thickens (kind of) when the woman finds her aunt's diary and learns that she was about to marry a preacher, but then dumped him for a Satanist!
And then the spooky old house seems to come to life.
We get fed the common haunted house plot - basically, a woman inherits a house from her aunt but, believe it or not, her aunt was into witchcraft - blah blah blah, and then strange things start to happen.
If hell is to be surrounded by beautiful women 24 hours a day and being worshiped and loved by every one of them then maybe its where we all should go.
But then again, the Americans never got a grasp on Potter's humour.
The script seems less to have been "written" then compiled from a book of clichÃ©s by an illiterate night manager at Wal-Greens.
But before you can even fathom how it ends let me tell you how it begins, a girl gets a gun to her head by some freako that said he saw this town, which they didn't even know what it was then.
He then explains the whole situation.
Me and a friend were sitting in the local movie store and decided to just go to the horror section, spin around in a circle, and point at the first movie we saw and then rent said movie.
The only remotely significant character, who I assume is some kind of angel that wears black, is an Aussie who has about 8 minutes of screen time and then disappears for the rest of the film.
This movie needs to be filed under comedy for the unintentional hilarity that ensues on this whacky adventure all the way from the random beginning, over the mountain of plot less and disconnected exposition and then ultimately to the regret of even wasting your time on this.
The producer(s) must take out a second mortgage or something else dire, and then roll the dice and hope that enough schmucks will shell out their hard earned cash to gobble up their vile stew.
If you must submit yourself to this "film," and I use the term loosely, then get it for $0.50 at Family Video.
Of confounding interest to other filmmakers may be the fact that EVIL CITY sold to distribution with almost no effort a few short weeks after availability of screeners; DVD's hit the chain store shelves in the U.S. so fast that a star of the film found out when hewent in to rent a movie and saw his name on a film box he didn't recognize ( the working title of EVIL'S CITY was THE LAZARUS SPORE, and then CROSSING ACHERON by wrap of photography ).
(and speaking of porn,the story might even be better).pointless,gore,lame dialogue.the whole thing is one big long boring mess.with no real beginning,middle or end.not only is there no conceivable story,there also a pointless non subplot that attempts to tie into the main non story.i can't see who the target audience would be for this particular movie.but everybody has their own different taste.however,this is added to my list of worst movies i have ever seen.this gets the big goose egg.definitely not recommended.but then,what do i know?
The four lesbians then head out on some sort of vacation and basically prove to be boring, unlikable bitches on the way to their rented lakeside cabin while another horrible cover (this time of "Radar Love") plays.
If Roger Kumble did such a fancy job on the first Cruel Intentions then why did he do such a bad job on this.
There is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video.
So if you are looking to see something naughty, but don't have the courage to buy porn then rent this film as a starter.
There are also inconsistencies in the plot - if this were truly the first meeting of Christian and Kathryn, then why is it that Christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie?
He's a bit too much of a bumbling oaf for the majority of the picture, then suddenly becomes incredibly competent and authoritative out of the blue for action scenes.
I wasn't clear until I read the IMDB that this movie was meant to be a prequel, especially since the title includes a number "2," I expected a sequel, but then determined that it must be a companion piece.
(Sebastian's father married into wealth, then why does he have a rich Aunt on long island?)
I was a bit confused at first but then I caught on and realized what was going on.
3- He does a complete 180, and ends up in a threesome at the end of the movie, and then seducing Cherry.
The first time I saw this film it really scared Me!The alien is very realistic and the scene where the scientist is operating on the alien's mate is disturbing but yet realistic.I don't want to go any more but I'll tell you this that if you like alien,sci-fi and horror films then check it out!
Every now and then to spice things up, Kosugi puts in an appearance and it's no coincidence that these episodes are the best of the series which sans his presence is somewhat pedestrian at best.
If you have never seen the original, then you may just become confused as to what this movie is all about.
The rest of the movie is horrible heterosexist garbage with Lisa Bonet and Lucas Haas staring longingly at each other, and then lying in bed congratulating each other for being heterosexual.
Back then, "Lathe" was a bold experiment for PBS and the producers: To make an original full-length science-fiction TV movie on a limited budget that would appeal to an audience used to flashier entertainment.
Remember, it was only three years since "Star Wars" and "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" had revitalized screen science fiction, until then very much in the doldrums.
Well, you make his neurotic wife run away with somebody else, and then make him get mad when the girl puts on his wifes clothing and only later give in to his feelings.
I felt bad for him for about 5 minutes and then just wanted to beat his ass.
And if this movie won any awards as one reviewer states, then I have a "documentary" of me sleeping I'd like to submit to the judges.
And if these reviews are truly sincere, well, then I will politely disagree with them.
And if it WERE the former, rather then the latter, all the likability of Brian flies out the window as no matter how charismatic a stalker may be, the fact remains that they ARE in fact stalking someone.
Things get mildly interesting (and decidedly awkward) for a few minutes and then - thankfully - it's over.
If you want to see John Wayne in something different from his usual fare, then "McQ" might appeal to youÂ but everyone else will probably come from the film feeling rather disappointed.
If so, then maybe this disaster might not have been dumped on us.
This one is really horrible..... don't watch it...the acting,plot,is so lame and everything made me laugh especially the bad guys....very unbelievable, the scene where Alex gets out of the Mine trap with the other guy is utter nonsense.....if you feel like watching a movie with some of your friends just to make fun of this crap then this is the movie you should watch... Alex is actually shot in the chest..but you know what she makes it thanks to her motorolla which was in her pocket.....wow....i could go on forever like this..i decided to watch the movie just to see how it would end and warn others from this ...2 out of 10 just for her looks
Woeful adaptation of David Williamson's sarcastic, ocker Australian play about a young Tasmanian lad who is recruited by a powerful Victorian Football League club for an unprecedented transfer fee, and then begins to send the club into turmoil with his bad attitude and shocking performances.
All I saw was Jack Nicholson playing an extremely depressed man, Karen Black dressed up to be made to sexy as his dumb girlfriend and then there was the rest of the cast.
While stuck in traffic Bobby gets out of the car and gets in the back on a truck with a piano and starts playing, then the truck leaves and Elton loses him.
4) Samuel Jackson is shown to explain about the penguins nicely in the start but then he messes it all up by using foul words on them.
Because the whole movie is voice-over, it's a pleasant surprise to have another character walk onto screen, say a line of obscene dialog, and then you exclaim, "Oh my God, that's _________!".
For the few genuinely hilarious moments that reached further then this trite March of the Penguins farce, I am unexpectedly happy for, but for a majority of screen time, viewers need either be indulging their chemical dependencies, or mocking aloud with friends in order to receive anything special out of this shell of a movie.
Since then, for quite some time, I've been aware of the title, "Farce of the Penguins", but didn't see it for a while.
Before then, cowboy hats were huge and round topped with a slight crease down the middle.
If incomprehensible wire-fu wuxia is your thing and you love films such as 'New Dragon Inn' and 'Swordsman', then you'll probably love this film, but as much as I appreciated the silliness of the whole thing, I just didn't find it that enjoyable overall.
To describe the list of people who took part in these two series as "Z" list is not accurate;if any person one day finds a new letter (or letters) to come after "Z",then that will be clearly apt.Currently,there are 26 letters in the English alphabet;if we ever get to the 1,000th,then you'll have reached that trough as far as this programme is concerned.
I had to force myself to watch half of it and even then I truly felt like killing myself.
So if you really feel like convincing yourself to commit suicide then watch, or at least attempt to, watch this movie.
If you do not enjoy torturing yourself then stay far far far away from this garbage, for the love of everything that holy.
The kid then goes back inside, deliberates over this with his parents for about 10 seconds, and the next scene is the family saying goodbye to him.
5) Eliot gets knocked out by a gang of Nazi skinheads while symbolically throwing away his bag of prescription (and non-) narcotics and is then taken in for the night by a haggard homeless man casually toting a rifle.
Eliot notices the man has no shoes, so he offers him his own boots, and then spends the rest of the film barefoot, even walking across cities and towns this way.
What the story tellers also fail to mention is that they weren't coming forth about the abuse (if that's what they thought it was then) to anyone.
He goes on how that experience disturbed him, but then he recalls experimenting with this man.
First he said he didn't remember, but remembers everything else and was disturbed, but then allowed it to happen on another occasion.
i guess if you are a huge fan of smith's and clerks then you cant go wrong but there are tons of other comedic short films out there - most relying on dialgoue - that are a helluva lot funnier than this but never get any recognition.
So Randal is baiting Dante, till he finally gets Dante to say what he wants, then Randal does a U-turn and lambastes poor old Dante.
I honestly can't believe that the producers would buy this and then spend 50 million on it with a B cast.
I'm not one of those people that thinks that Caruso is a bad actor, but I certainly don't think that he is big enough from a TV show to open a film, and if I, as a casual film fan can figure that out for myself, then why can't powerful movie executives?
Back then Crenna had more of a name, after all he was Trautman.
When I was a kid I used to like the original first American Tail film, but then they started making straight-to-video sequels.
Young Fievel Mousekevitz the mouse gets lost again (for a little while) and then decides to try and get rid of all the cats from the West part of America, where the story left off.
As for the boy's adult years, now that we can look back on the baby boomers' young adult life, it would have been more realistic to portray him as a hippie and then a disco pimp.
I thought, hey this could be interesting, then I found out how absolutely, insanely, ridiculously stupid it really was.
It's tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest & then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style.
They would tell part of the joke in English, and then the punchline in Spanish.
But then the business with the drive in the country, winding up in the barn, and all that, the movie really started to unravel.
Towards the end of the film then, the screenwriter obviously decided that the script was missing something and so decided to change then entire end of the story.
This brings me onto casting and then the acting of the people who were cast.
Kind of...  Why 3 stars and not 1 then?
Let's then make this thing clear once and for all: the people responsible for cracking the Enigma's code were the group of Polish mathematicians, among them M. Rejewski, J. Rozycki and H. Zygalski.
Let Parnell do it, write it, and then hand it over to someone to do the part.
It probably pitches like it could be funny (and even successful), but it falls apart as a film, completely...If you understand this, then you also understand it sounds more like an off-Broadway play...As a matter of fact (and the ore I think about it), this 'movie' would probably do very well in a live theatrical format...Heck, it could take on a life of its own and become syndicated, making the US cities tour, complete with building sized promos appearing in each city months before it premiers to build the anticipation...I'm certain performing arts centers all over the country will sell out all the shows quickly as anticipation grows and of course the wealthy season ticket holders would let everyone know they'll be busy on Friday evening, because they will be at the 'premier' of that play...'The Grand'...As a matter of fact, the more 'I' think about it, given the opportunity; 'I'd' pitch it!
The problem (again) is that we aren't talking about 'The Grand-the play'...we're talking about 'The Grand--the movie'...which sadly, doesn't work...The other alternative for this material would be a SNL skit...or maybe the Comedy Channel coud've made it an hour and a half long TV comedy-movie, but even then there would need to be some casting revisions and a lot of editing...
and then the waiter says "thank you very much".
I must say I laughed and then I winced at was was factually wrong.
All I will say is that if you are going to do a film about football violence then at least do your research first.
In the third part, Meeko is first hypnotized by, then befriends a talking computer, while Nukie disco dances.
Or maybe it's the welter of teenage horror since then that makes these things seems light.
You find yourself watching a scene, realizing that every line and every action is utterly without merit, wishing the scene would just END--then it does, and a new scene begins, equally stupid, and you realize that the last scene's eternity was really only about 30 seconds long, and this movie is about 90 minutes.
Typical gag: Charlie, pretending to be the dentist while his boss is away, flirts with a pretty young patient, then takes a pair of pincers, pinches her nose, and yanks her face over for a kiss.
And then I suffered.
But why then did they leave out the ultimate action scene in this book where the DA and the death eaters fight in Hogwarts?
All the more disappointing then that in the end, Draco went through all this effort just so Bellatrix could burn down Hagrid's hut.
Good luck breaking random things in order to defeat him then, Harry.
He must've faced a much more physical challenge in HBP than in any other HP movie he's done before, but then again, the older he gets, the more is expected of him.
I thought then that the book has been done a disservice.
I believe they left some for the first part of the Deadly Hallows, but then again this sixth movie was completely unnecessary and pointless.
The change wasn't too bad -- back then.
In the movie, he makes out as if it could be any old thing, a shoe, a can, a piece of paper... (better get searching then Harry, I found the ring, because "Magic leaves traces", but when I die, you're screwed!!!)
and then I was shocked to find sexual innuendo!
Good thing Luna CHARMED it off him then!!!
But then again, it's getting great reviews, so I think I'm part of the minority of people who were really, really hoping to get a Harry Potter movie that would make JK Rowling proud, at least when she cared.
After a great opening, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine return for their sixth year at Hogwarts and then, nothing.... We get two slow hours of Ron's potion making, and teenage angst, with little mention of Tom Riddle's memories, or Harry and Dumbledore's hunt for his horcruxes.
The Weasley's house is burned, and then instead of the DD funeral, they change the ending.
If David Yates screws up Deathly Hollows half as badly as he screwed up Order of the Phoenix, and Half Blood Prince, then he will be the one to blame for taking the Potter series seriously downhill.
The Germans take English villagers hostage but honorably let them all go unharmed, then die together fighting for the Fatherland rather than surrender.
First you got the kid being grabbed by the FBI after trying to escape through the window then the girl screaming her head off during pig dissections and then suicide and a python and the teacher disappearing.
Samuel West has hardly any lines in this movie, which is sort of a crime when you consider the folly of hiring one of the most golden-throated actors in all of England to be in your short flick, and then not giving him much more to say other than..."Ooof....urp.....glgugggggghhhrrggg....<splat>".
Branagh (bearded) has a few lines in the beginning, which he delivers with characteristic gusto, and then later on, a guy named Julian Glover shows up.
I do not know how anything can get worse then this.
The Clowns are a rock band whose on stage antics include mutilation and murder but then groupies start dying for real and the band members are the prime suspects.
(Interesting then, isn't it, that "Shelter" contains the heterosexual leads and "Save Me" the gay ones).
Wow, this movie wasn't great, I'm a huge fan of Paul Gross, and I must say, it looks like he tried, but there wasn't much point in wasting energy, however, if you enjoy laughing at movies that have completely missed the mark, (and seeing some excellent shots of Paul Gross)then this movie is good, however, if you are looking for an excellent adaptation of the book, I strongly recommend looking elsewhere.
Based on the Jules Verne novel by the same name, the movie then tells of further adventures on board the Nautilus, and of a romance not included in the book.
The book is a warning about advanced technology used for wrong purposes, adapting this to nuclear power in the Disney version was actually a pretty good idea back then as it was a very popular topic used in many b-movies of that period.
I'm just gonna write this review and then go on reading about fabric-hall design in the early 20th century.
The acting is, even though you wouldnt think it's possible, worse then the script.
If this p.o.s can be called a sequel then Hollywood is truly an awful place to make films.
The action is quite good at first but then , towards the ending, it looks like a cheap footage from typical direct to video mediocrity.
Maybe the golden years of sleazy & campy "Women in Prison" were long history by then already; maybe it didn't get properly promoted or announced in trailers (like "Reform School Girls", for example) or maybe it's just not good enough to compete with other & more successful films with a similar theme, but "Hell Hole" is a totally anonymous & overlooked 80's exploitation flick that only a handful of genre fanatics have heard of.
Mad Foxes is just as ridiculous as it's meant to be and then some...however, while I enjoy a good silly flick, the inconstancies and illogical nature of the film don't help it as the plot doesn't move well at all, and the film gets confusing too often, which isn't good when the plot is as simple as the one here.
The writing is syrupy sweet, the dialog appropriate for the 19th century, and then it was probably over the top in social correctness.
To disparage the flag or this film is unpatriotic--but is it patriotic, then, to accept everything you see and hear without question?
If you believe that to be true, then by all means see this movie.
The start was drab and low key with no bond music, the opening seen was quite good but nothing new and the film then went from bad to worse.
Bond should kill a guy, make a glib joke, then look for the next scumbag that needs killin'.
A Bond who falls in love then cries his eyes out when she dies?
If you have an open mind, or are/have been in a similar situation, or just want to see a DAMNED good movie, then this one is definitely worth sitting down and watching.
So, in order to help those fans, that still want to see the movie, to save some money, I'll round up the story now:  Bond kills one guy in a loo, then kills another guy in an office.
Right then, I couldn't help myself but noticing the restroom tiles in the background(!)
If you're a tremendous fan of Ferrell or McBride, then this picture might be tolerable.
I feel sorry for Anna Friel, first the show that she is absolutely adorable in gets cancelled, then the final episode is almost as bad as the final episode of Seinfeld, then what could have been a great movie for her career - the only other real character in a major Will Ferrell comedy - turns out to be a terrible, stinking turd of a flick.
Finally in the third act the Slestaks, reptilian villains bent on world domination, start to put their plan into effect but even then it's too little, too late to care.
And then the plot shifts gears: While discussing a passage from Shakespeare's "Richard II" (which probably has a symbolic bearing on the story) Milland and his students hear sirens.
If Mario Lopez wants to put the thought into peoples mind that he "might" be gay then he would have been better off not wearing that body stocking during the very strained love scene in this disaster of a movie.
The scene leaves you watching them talk and then all of a sudden they kiss and are in bed together.
About the movie, why didn't any of the criminals just smash the G2 robot-thing, I mean how hard can it be to whack her in the head with a lead pipe and wrap her up with some chains then tear her apart with crow bars.
Good thing Matthew Broderick didn't sign up for this movie cause then he would be completely humiliated and considered a bad actor.
As the space impostor then begins the usual rampage through Tokyo, you begin your attack on him, and Moguera joins in, crashing and burning several times and even separating its own legs from its torso!
The UFO then crash lands in the Arizona desert where our government picks it up and takes it to Hangar 18 for analysis.
NASA, the military and the US government then all have to figure out what to do about it.
And then Tom, tormented by the sensation of having his mouth full of sand, drinks water from the bucket, but it's ocean water and Tom spits it straight to the female cat's face!
Even back then I actually didn't mind the rugrats.
Pamela Sue Martin, then part of the acting ensemble on TV's "Dynasty", co-wrote, co-produced and stars in this tatty tale of drug addiction.
If you want to see a movie about things that will happen when you stop taking your medication, then this is a movie to see.
Both the 'discovery' of a fantasy underworld, and then the clumsy Frankenstein narrative, are irredeemably hackneyed story lines that the director attempts to conceal behind portentous dialogue, edgy security-camera footage and a naked young woman.
if you are starting to make movies then this is good to watch, what can be done with 30 000 Euros (40k $).
At one point, Arly Jover is providing fellatio to a very dumb Vampire Hunter and then she sucks his blood while doing the sex act.
Bon Jovi then decides that if that blood is transfused into him, he can beat Arly by becoming a vampire also.
Jerry then takes big bites out of poor Tom, to gets further bitten by a crab, on and on and on.
He then returns a day later only to be surprised that the vampires attacked the monastery the night after he left...  ...avoid this movie.
You can start feeling how this movie would be just looking at his lead actor (Jon Bon Jovi); is a huge difference in the acting quality compared to James Woods, and then, if you watch the film (i don't recommend this part), you will get involved in one of the more simplest stories, totally predictable, with terrible acting performances, really bad special effects and incoherent events!.
Even the ending refused to yield a satisfying conclusion - yes, I can imagine what the ending was SUPPOSED to convey, but if it's left ENTIRELY up to my imagination (which it most certainly was) then why not just dream up scenarios myself?
Rather she looks like an anorexic 14 year girl, no wonder she is so desperate for blood then.
Instead she hides out in some old ruin which looks more like a Disneyland attraction then a creepy temple.
This one has less plot then usual for such flicks, so change the channel if you don't like this kind of movie, and grit your teeth if you're into this kind of thing.
The Zim scenery was beautiful, but then even Hollywood can't change that.
i also learnt that if you are shot then there are no bullet holes and no blood.
if you want to watch an idiotic attempt at an interesting second world war story, with no thought at all towards realism then this is the film for you.
You start getting into the tale of the what's behind the strange music from the violinist (in The Music of Erich Zann) and then a couple minutes later you're in present day, wait a few minutes & then you're off again to the story revolving around the mathematician (in Dreams in the Witch House).
I think that the movie might have done better if the present day investigators introduced the Shunned House & then started to tell what happened by showing the complete piece on Erich Zann, a little bit more of the Shunned House, the whole piece on the Dreams of the Witch House & then let the Shunned House story finish off the movie.
Black then fully realizes what his heroic choice has cost him, and ends up lonely, embittered and perhaps mad.
The ending of "The Pledge" is badly, terribly wrong, as it trashes what up until then was one of the finest suspense films I've ever seen and one of Jack Nicholson's greatest performances.
6) Even if Kirk fell in love with Odona (as was the plan to make him voluntarily stay), if she had died as planned then there's not much reason for him to stick around, is there?
I recommend watching twice with a pen and paper in order to take notes and then you can maybe begin to understand the over complicated story line.
Other then the fantastic villain of Armand Assante and the very brief reference to Aztec culture this film went where it shouldn't have.
Since then I have yet to take my kids to a Dreamworks film (especially after seeing Shrek).
We have three broads arriving on a boat, still in the clothes they were apparently arrested in, tried in Court, and then literally, sent up the river in!
Perhaps men treated their wives in a different manner way back then that was condoned by the general public, but I was shocked.
I mean, I know they probably wanted a different tack then the Nick & Nora approach (William Powell & Myrna Loy), but this just didn't work for me.
and ryan phillippe did a great job - i somehow didn't like him to much after cruel intentions, then in way of the gun he was pretty cool but now I'm a real fan of him!
The script has its moments with some nice suspense but then it tried to be too smart for its own good and the plot turned unbelievable, dumb and a complete mess.
Someone actually read the script for this and then persuaded investors to put up the money?
But then you can always come back tomorrow and get shot, so you can ride to the trailer-house clinic in the paramedic ambulance that seems to be in every shot.
The good thing about child-filmmakers is that they don't care about such things, and rich investors gleefully hand over large sums of money to make movies like this, and then lose their money.
Luckily from then and onwards, the pacing remains steadily fast, the atmosphere becomes grimmer, the make- up effects are satisfying and even Charles Napier's supportive characters Â which until then was a dull persona Â becomes sleazier.
Granted that things were more innocent back then even in Hollywood before the Code.
Warner Brothers got things a whole lot better with James Cagney in The Mayor of Hell the following year and then in a whole series of films with The Dead End Kids.
You know those twilight zone episodes where you are instantly enraptured into the plot and then at the end there is a surprise twist, and all of a sudden the episode come across differently?
/SPOILER)  Arghhhh This is just a frustrating movie in which you think the lead is just psychotic then you learn no it's really you, you are the crazy one who bothered to see this Ryan Phillipe movie!
When I enjoy a new show for a season or two but then find it growing stale or repetitive or degenerating into self-parody, prompting me to stop planning to see it and eventually to turn it off when I happen across it accidentally, that's a show that I will give a vote of 3 and then write a comment explaining that I'm not panning the entire run of the show but only the later seasons.
We see a gardener that the villains have captured and Eddie watches for a moment or two as they try to sweat information out of him then approach himÂthe gardenerÂwith the glowering end of a steel rod.
Prolific scenarist Audrey Wisberg and director William A. Berke then pull a real boner by reinserting the Harrison character back into the story in the Canal Zone (much to Eddie's surprise and consternation as a woman with impeccable credentials who is a Nazi agent's girlfriend.
And then there's Hamill, who'll always be remembered to everyone as Luke Skywalker.
The villain changed vehicle from Laura's car to Bus, then ambulance, but Hero recognizes every vehicle.
The ending was meaningless does it mean he has another chance and why Dr. Newman was his father then became Dr. Newman again in the ending... such a waste of time and money...
Mr. Arlen writes John and Martha Smithers a check, to buy their oil-rich land, then schemes to cover its cost.
The first twenty minutes are mildly engaging, although even then it was quite apparent things were only going to get worse.
I wanted to walk out of the theater and demand my money back...  ...but then I suddenly realized that I was working there.
It's like they introduced the hospital scenes solely to have Rachel accused of child abuse, & then they just drop the point.
I thought Sissy Spacek was great (but then, she usually is), almost unrecognizable in fact.
Everyone should just watch the Ring One, get scared, be happy, then burn every copy of the Ring Two.
If a movie has to use profanity like that to make it better, then the movie itself must just be crap.
But if you can get past the regression of the story, then what is even more disturbing is that there is nothing remotely disturbing, interesting or scary about the film, and everything that was freaky about Samara in the first one is now like watching Scooby Doo and mystery of Samara.
But then again, there are sequels that can match the original, if not surpass it.
At least two of the Friday the 13th sequels surpass the original and if you are talking non horror, then you can also add films like Lethal Weapon 2, Bourne Supremacy and of course classics like Terminator 2, Aliens, Godfather II and Empire Strikes Back to the list of sequels that either equaled or surpassed the original.
Oh, well then, it all makes sense now.
This thing from some nether world that can make things happen with the power of its mind gets killed in a well, comes back from the dead through VHS tapes and murders people within 7 days of witnessing said tapes then inexplicably possesses a living boy.....cuz she wants to watch TV with her mom?
The kids in the first movie watched the tape at the cabin and then went back to their homes and I doubt that they left a forwarding address for Samara to find them.
The film follows Rachel Keller into Oregon where she tries to forget the events of the first one, but then Samara shows up wanting a mommy... and that is the point of the film.
I am sure Naomi Watts would rather have changed Samara's diaper then done this film!
You've got to compare then because the first one sucks and the latter one is great; because the cast of the first one is way superior to the latter one'sÂ   I like Ryan Phillippe is a starring role: I liked "Cruel Intentions" and very much liked "Antitrust".
If they're gonna make another reunion movie (which I doubt it), then they should come up with a different plot.
Back then he had raped Kitty and beat her, something Matt did not know.
Robot Wrecks blows the premise by bastardizing the robot by stuffing it with Billy Ray "Boxcar" Smith and allegedly fueling it with "invisible rays" and then selling it to one of their usual foes, Freddie "Slicker" Walburn (who's atypically gullible here).
If you have not been reading news and do not know what is global warming doing to our planet, or where do polar bears live (besides the zoo), or how walruses look like, then perhaps this show will benefit you.
Where were the polar bears then?
If these kids are the world's only hope,...then we are so royally screwed!
Well...I'm going back into my cave, then it's back to another day of Pocket Ninja watching.
The acting was so bad, it didn't even have a chance to become good and then go bad again.
On top of that you couldn't even hear what they were saying so you had to turn up the volume, then you were blasted with loud music.
There are low budget/direct to video movies, and then there is trash like this.
You might get out a few guilty laughs at some of the dumber moments, granted they might just be a response triggered by the brain cells this film kills at speeds higher then grain alcohol.
If you didn't pay to watch the movie, then sue him for solatium, for this is mental cruelty on tape.
I can't even tell you what its about, but if your looking for the worst movie ever, then I think you've found it.
The quarter was more then enough to put that poor DVD out of its misery.
It then was aptly flung around until it shattered on a radiator.
If this didn't kill their careers then nothing will.
The story was slowly coming together and the mystery was solved but confused about the character of Anna and why she was even in it.First she's his wife,then she's a nursing student,and then a blackmailer.Her character in the whole story just did not fit.I understood at the end how all the other characters fit in to what was going on.At the end each person in the hospital,both doctors(including his own father as one),his brother and his lover Claire who was his brother's wife had a part in Simon's head as he was wanting to go back to the past and make things right but it was too late.
He joins the thieves and then turns on them.
Since then, Mr. Daniels has been in a variety of bad pictures and this one is on par with "Dumb and Dumber."
I was quite surprised to see that the writer/director of The Lookout has quite an established career as a Hollywood writer, since this film offers nothing new (then again, maybe that's a key to longevity in Hollywood).
We see him in some sort of rehabilitation school for about a minute, then a brief meeting with a therapist, (assuming she will be a major character in the piece), who is never seen or heard from again.
Take a shoddy car, stuff a few superfluous accessories in it - such as advanced DVDs whose features you won't use at home let alone in a damn car - and then watch the vehicle's owner (always a moron) throw a hysterical fit of jubilation once he sees how over-the-top silly his car has become.
My advice to future PMC customers: sell the car IMMEDIATELY to some desperate nerdy fan of the show, and then buy a REAL car.
He really doesn't do much other then driving the car and telling bad jokes (and supplying his own annoying laugh to tell you when something he says is funny).
The West Coast Customs workers will then sit around and discuss what they are going to do to the car.
I would much rather have a car that has a nice paint job and a new engine then a bunch of unnecessary things that make my car the perfect target for a thief.
Some reason I felt psychic, now if only I could have predicted the lottery numbers then I would have been set, unfortunately this movie is too predictable.
It's about a guy who, after being a successful mountain climber, came home and in a daze killed his wife and children, then hung himself.
then there are jumping camera effects (including some little girl with cataracts or something) in only one scene that never show their face again.
Recommended only to Gemser completists-and even then I'd just recommend re- watching EMMANUELLE IN America.
A further problem is that the central chase is quite uninspired, with only a scene in which Bugs orders pies and then puts them in Elmer's face really standing out.
anyway, the shock ending isn't much of a shock, and you've probably already turned the channel by then.
Emily then decides she must live among the Chasidim to learn about their community, to prevent further murders, because the murder looked like an inside job, a possibility considered unthinkable by the Jews.
The film then takes Emily on a voyage of discovery of Chasidism.
We are distracted by her beauty and then distracted from that by her ludicrously bogus French accent.
If you find her too old for comparative purpose, then one could compare to Jake Lloyd, little Anakin skywalker (SW E1).
So what do you get.. its not even close to Bravehart, some scenes in Bravehart you could see people just stand and swing a sword in the background, its the same here, but its the main characters who do it... sigh.. Thers a "love story" in this movie too, following that one is more painful then jumping from a cliff just to see the end of the day.
The movie leaves much to wish for from its sequel but if you like well done fighting scenes and don't care much for story or acting - then, my friend, giddyupp!
I'm not sure what the director thought about when he made this movie, but I guess he thought that he could make about 100 scenes with people saying 2-3 lines, then another 100 scenes of scenery.
Cut them together like a zip-lock and then let the audience do the rest.
Several of these scenes have been edited to try to hide acting mistakes, and then dubbed, but mismatching dialog and mouth movements can clearly be discerned.
and then slide into the center to capture the people.
So, unless it is a free rental and/or you get off on human-on-human violence, expect to pay a rental fee to see the beginning and then fast forward through to the surprise ending.
Indeed, the action of the film (such as there is) is so preposterous, one can't imagine it happening anyway; but then this film knows not whether it is sci-fi or thriller, mystery or psychological drama -- no wonder the audience is reduced to focusing on its stars rather than on what they say or do as characters.
if alex is the killer, then 90% of the movie involving alex fighting/running from the redneck didn't happen.
This filmmaker conned us into believing we would be taken care of, then f*ck ed us over.
If the whole story must be filtered through the insane killer's perspective, and it must be or it doesn't make any sense and can't make any sense, then what's the point of the whole story?
So it's her then?
Picture some dimwit introducing their self to you as Chuck, having a conversation with you, then proudly revealing their name is actually Aja and that they really outsmarted you.
and then there was godzilla.
Pass on this film, people, it will make you want to beat your head off a couple of rocks and then stick your head in a microwave while you sit on a grill, because this movie is utter crap!
Godzilla then travels to Manhattan and creates havoc in the city, killing dozens of people.
I saw a VW bug, then I saw a Rolliflex camera, and then I saw 1980 print dresses and 1940 type costuming.
In a general way, of course, you hate to see a movie doing some of the things to a character that are done to Joanna unless there is some point to be made, and the best point that could be made in this kind of Candide story when, for instance, Joanna's boyfriend philosophizes that women want to be treated rough and then he does just that -- as I'm saying, the best point that could be made from this is that this is the way the world is, here are some of the terrible cracks exposed in the world Joanna lives in.
He is meant to exemplify the psychedelic metaphysics of beauty and oneness that the movie makes pastel stabs at pushing, and he has to spout all this hooey about it and he is supposed to find its embodiment in that shapely potato, Joanna, and then he is supposed to die, which is the best thing he does.
Genevieve Waite's over-the-top performance only makes sense by the time you reach the film's self-mocking conclusion, and by then you've had your fill of her.
How odd then that so much of the film wanders around aimlessly from venue to venue, from person to person, from incident to incident with so little meaning or consequence.
It begins with magical spirits flying up a man's nose (he looks like a telekinetic coke addict), and then goes down hill from there.
So Coach gives him the keys and he drives away- but then the family realizes that they need a ride home!
Stop me if you've heard this plot before(like from "My Boyfriend's Back) but Steve then proceeds to hide Amy's current undead state from his friends and family.
I was both startled and disappointed, then, when he began laughing with the voice of a young teenager.
If this is the future of independent film-making, then independent film-making is, quite frankly, doomed.
Oh my what a let down, promising trailer till you hear one of the actors speak, then its worse than your daytime soap.
Please, if you are a die-hard Star Wars fan and truly love the saga, then I would say don't waste your time.
Frankly, I found it childishly contrived even then.
If this ran on NBC during the big Cheers/Seinfeld/Friends decade, then it would have ran for nine years, supported on bigger shows.
I give a show a 3 if I really enjoyed it for the first year or two, but then found it growing stale, stopped planning to watch it, and eventually turned it off when I accidentally ran across it.
There is no redeeming qualities in this film, and if you see it in the bargain bin on DVD, take it up to the clerk, chastise them for improper labeling, then have the clerk stick a Frisbee sticker on it.  
The film then switches to a house somewhere in London, we get a shot of the river Thames, the Houses of Parliment & Big Ben just to prove it.
And then we have snow.
And then there's sun and plants.
And then I think this movie ended.
What is meant to be a scene in which Raskolnikov and Sonia experience profound repentance, grace and forgiveness during the reading of the gospel story of Lazarus, is twisted: Sonia reads one sentence of the Gospel (tossing aside the theme), and then it turns into a big kiss moment instead.
And if the film looks not to be very good, then lowering personal expectations in order to continue to enjoy the film is in order.
If Rodja's character is not established in the beginning of a film, then the entire story collapses and the film can from then on only be a sequence of loosely-stitched together scenes.
I do recall Daryl Hannah talking to Michael Madsen in car then getting out.
I give kids this age much more credit then the director of this movie...
The creeping around fun-house corridors is amusing for a while, then becomes repetitive.
Was the year when first Starship Troopers came out... Man, when I watch it now, it is strong as it was then... Good story, good CGI, good acting... That film was entirely good.
First, the Christianity was WAY out of line and over the top, then the celebration of executing people for speaking out and not conforming to the "norm" as defined by society, complete with marching companies and a victory march musical background.
In a scene they walk by a soldier and cut his throat in mid step then stem on a mans head.
This movie is possibly the worst movie i have EVER seen, as the first one is one of my favorite sci-fi films of all time i have been bitterly disappointed twice so far !please save yourself the same heart ache and just watch the first Starship Troopers again while imagining in your own mind the endless possibilities they could of embraced to build open, then if you really must, watch the second and third films and see how it was completely and utterly screwed up.
The hypocrisy is never addressed of a people or species or government that glorifies fighting and killing for what you believe in such as freedom and justice (and lower taxation) but then murders a peace activist, and calls them a "terrorist", for fighting for what HE believes, such as not having a wasteful intrusive repressive government that hates freedom of speech.
Rico's friends must now first save Rico, and then mount a covert rescue operation deep into enemy territory.
Even then I didn't expect too much at all out of this.
the plot is thin, very thin, the actors leave much to be desired, but then it gets worst at the end it starts a huge mumbo jumbo about religion that sounds like an "eat this lollypop and be cool" propaganda except its not propaganda its religion .
If you enjoyed the original starship troopers only for its fast-paced action scenes (which is a good amount of the movie), then you might not like this one.
It was better then Starship Troopers 2.
Van Diem shows up for the first few minutes and is seen for two minutes in the middle and then 5 minutes at the end.
Other then that the film is an attempt to be a sequel to an overrated first film done by people with even less talent and money.
The movie started out pretty decent and then it just kind of fell flat towards the end.
This series kind of reminds me of the Highlander Series: It started out really good, with a good story, then the producers got a hold of it and put it in the toilet(see recent Highlander:The Source, for confirmation) The point is, there is a fan base for this series.
It's better then the 2nd(not saying much), but very disappointing for those of us who really enjoy the first one and the spirit of the series.
On the next morning, I plugged "DIL CHAHATA HAI" again & then again.
By telling you all this nonsense childish stories, I'm trying convey here if one movie can create such a profound impact on a kid like me back then {I wasn't even the only one, after doing some personal survey back class, my friend-circle & the courtesy of some movie magazines}, It can not be just a movie; it has to be more than that.
To 'spice' it up a bit, we get some boob shots and then Rico saves the day.
I'd say it's so bad you have to love it, but really, it's so bad that if you love it then you're just... well, you have weird tastes, my friend.
Can she get him acquitted and then land the more lucrative job?
If you have a yen for disaster flicks, then you might take an interest in watching this one.
I am sure everyone who has seen more then 2 disaster flicks could of wrote this movie.
This character is usually the young fireman, or some other minor character who is helping out, we don't much about him other then him having a family and he is young.
3 A elderly person, we know nothing about them other then they are elderly and they are married or a dearly love relative of a major character.
And if you're going to make a ridiculously earnest film about the "Noble" Retarded Man (who I am sure is JUST as noble as the Noble American Indian and the Noble Black Guy) then at least hire real handicapped people to show up on screen.
First, she is digusted by him, then he SAYS HER NAME.
The movie opens with two rats locked in mortal combat, an alarm sounding, and then some nameless individual screaming with green makeup on his face.
There's at least 3 times in the movie where they could have stopped this monster dude but then...they didn't for some reason?
With pacing that could bore Ben Stein, characters that are less enjoyable then a Disney channel sitcom line-up, and an ending more predictable than the ending to "The Village", Panic gets 2 melty faces, out of 10
And then, the government decides to order the RAF to use the mass-destructive weapon...
Since then the composite-photograph-like mouse never shows up, and no one mentions it.
The subplot is mentioned then dropped, as if the writers just didn't know what to do with it.
I'll have my Pilot teaser be a rip-off of "Network", and then have my characters espouse their love for Paddy Chayefsky and do a send-up of "Pirates of Penzance"!
Also on this clip is when Bridget dresses up a black little dog for a costume just then the black dog lays down and does not like that costume.
Like Ironside, for instance... did you ever see that episode where he tried to get up the stairs without his wheelchair, and he just kept thumping along and then falling back down while the goofy music played, and then his assistant came in and said "Oh, Ironside, won't you ever learn?
and then everybody had a good laugh?
You might wonder why a detective would agree to learn a bunch of lines at the same time he's investigating a murder--or why he'd be asked to do this--or why he'd be allowed to do it--but then you'd be using your brain, which is not recommended if you're planning to enjoy the show.
The few episodes I've caught since then don't seem to have made significant changes.
It really sounds stupid, I mean, you buy the trade rights, you know it's been the greatest "telenovela" hit of all times, it's coming out fine Â and then, "if it's not broken why fix it?"
Avoid this unless you see it in a dollar bin at WalMart and even then you might want to pass.
I really love to listen to a philosopher talking about it, but I really really hate to hear it from a crazy writer/director who knows nothing or little about it then filmed a movie tell their nonsense "idea" and "truth"...
The movie starts with the present, with Dimple Kapadia being admitted in the hospital, and then a flashback sets in.
We are then shown a series of non brutal images from the Abu Ghraib prison followed by extreme grotesque videos from Iraq.
I had the album "The Decline Of Western Civilization" when it came out back then and I thought the Germs portion of the record was cool, but I was more of a Circle Jerks, Black Flag kind of guy.
He was a Iggy Pop wannabe and then an Adam Ant poser.
If that's how Darby really was, then i am not missing out on not listening to their music.
It's not giving too much away to say that the cause of the human's strange behaviour is in fact an airborne virus which infects people, then leaves the host for another when that person dies.
Since then, sadly, it's been a long, slow descent into mediocrity, straight THROUGH mediocrity, and into madness.
I guess it might have worked as a action movie, but then you would have to sit or sleep through the first half of the film.  
But then something went wrong.
And then after a decent setup, he proceeds to turn the whole thing into a brainless action flick in the style of his "Escape From" movies, or maybe a modern day Mad Max.
What about technology then?
I almost swallowed my icecream scoop when I first heard him, then I just laughed myself into a coma.
I mean, Oldboy is one of my all-time favorite films, I love Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance, and I was amazed at his segment in Three...Extremes, and I saw this knowing that I'd love it, and then this scene comes along and thoroughly betrays my trust in him as a filmmaker!!!
If you're reading this, then you're probably a fan of Park's previous films and like me have seen the first two films in his revenge trilogy (Sympathy for Mr Vengeance & Old Boy).
If drama is your cup of tea, then you might enjoy this.
I only have a few things to say about the film itself and then a personal conviction about Park as a director.
If a guy gets you a present, telling you he spent a ton of money on it, and then you reject him?
How ironic then that this all-talking backstager is spoiled by a camera that just won't sit still.
All these things were by then established cinematic conventions, and they still are, for good reason; they bring human interaction to life on the screen.
Basically a one character script due to the fact that Randy (Michael Pitt) had very little dialog and most of the movies dialog was by Stephen Adly Guirgis (Jake) who gave a good performance but still was not enough to save this movie from being awful, all and all i didn't enjoy this movie to recommend to you, so the best i can say is in this one sided movie was lackluster and didn't have much to offer it's audience in the way it was written it had no surprises or Suspense and little if any drama, the only thing that made this movie anything was Stephen Adly Guirgis (Jake) who's acting ability kind of saved this movie from being a total disaster which is what it came close to being, he did give it some uplifting moments at times but other then that it wasn't worth seeing, so take your chances if you do decide to watch this movie as it really failed in the script and the ending.
If this is one of his masterpieces, then it will likely be my last.
And then again, the whole "Charity Golf Turnament" set up is so weak.
Peter tried obviously hard, actors are as usual all great, so is the cinematography, but when hardly anyone laughs at the Berlin premiere, which I attended, then you have a major problem at hands.
The look and the coolness of the business is more interesting then a good script and really good ideas.
And there is also for Peter as for Thomas nothing more as a filmmaker then their very funny first movies.
But for a good movie it needs more the then privacy of a local-hero.
***** end of spoiler ********  I suppose if you really like to laugh AT movies rather than WITH them then you've really got to get this.
For hardcore noir enthusiasts the first half an hour is really worth viewing, then turn the TV off.
In addition, there are a few too many absurdities in the plot (e.g, why would Milner, having escaped being dragged aboard Ferraro's yacht, then go back there on his own to put himself in a situation where he is outnumbered 15 to 1?).
.... it's even embarrassing to say that i'm Dominican and that THAT movie is Dominican too, i really think this movie had a bad star with one of THE worst posters i've seen in my life, it looked like it was done in Paint, by a 5 year-old!, then the trailer came and just confused me, us, even MORE, trying to make it see like it was a comedy, or a romantic movie, hell, even a drama and some horror they threw in!!
With much pomp, Lillie recites a dignified speech ... then she hikes up her skirt to reveal that she's wearing roller skates, and she skates merrily away.
The first half of the movie was ok and pretty innocent, but then the rest freaked me out.
Who is he then, you ask?
As the increasingly sluggish movie drones on, Roth gets more involved with the bar punk but then tries to pull back when he grows so rough and possessive that it becomes abusive.
Essentially, this is the film's plot- Takes place in one of those newly developing neighborhoods... Parents bug kid about having remote control toys, parents then leave house, then burglars enter kids' house... kid uses remote control stuff to fend off burglars... burglars cook steak... kid uses remote control stuff to obtain steak... kid eats steak... roll credits... we are all now dumber for watching this film.
The question is "why did you do it then?"
If Bush had really been assassinated then by all means make a documentary about the causes of the assassination but to make one on a president who is not dead is despicable.
How convenient then that he doesn't show his face until the President is already critical, and then only to try to derail the investigation and cover up his misdeeds.
Greetings and if any of this does indeed spoil the movie for you then you really have not missed much anyway but there is a disturbing aspect with this production that just must be commented on.
If these people are suggesting that, then they are worse than stupid.
If you are ready to lose 90 pointless minutes of your lives that you will never get back, and get your intelligence insulted, then watch this!
This movie deserves to be protested, shot, then put on fictional trial before we all come together and whine about crappy movies.
then some tacked on story about some professor with a grudge against the pie shop owner, and i'm like, is this meant to be some statement about small town revelry.
then there's all this nonsense crap about 20-somethings being promiscuous and i'm like, is this a story about youths out of control.
where were the larger then life characters?
Imagine how this puerile rubbish was pitched: "Hey there's this guy, right, and he loses his wee-wee, and gets a new one... and then we can do these jokes about Viagra and 69s and poo and farts and other stuff that we came up with after six beers and a whole stack of old comedy tapes.
Watching it was like having a pencil shoved in my eye and it being swirled around, then having a bunch lit of cigarettes put out all over my body.
sorry it's really movie i couldn't understand at all first of all the name's were very strange to me then the plot was very confused the relationships between the characters of the movie another mystery what's happened to the mother is she died ?
Sonali Kulkarni didn't seem so much at ease with the commercial cinema, but then too gave pretty good performance.
The boys think it would be great fun to pretend to shoot someone and then stuff him in the trunk and drive off - shocking numerous people who will witness the incident.
We discover Carol is really Patty, and then she hops a freight train?!
It seems like it was first slated as a movie-of-the-week but then an fading MGM figured to score some box office bucks with the gimmick of this being one of their last movies shot on a studio lot.
If you can't keep the boom guy out of the frame, then you have a systemic problem with the show.
She does the job, but then falls for Oland's Russian contact McLaglen.
(A CLASSIC)I think Kickboxer 4 just made Tong Po look so stupid and weak.In the original he lost to Van Damme but he still was a bad mofo.In 2 and 4 they made him like look an amateur.I know Van Damme ain't a great actor but his action scenes make up for that.Sasha Mitchell on the other hand is a terrible actor(acting scenes and fighting scenes)If your gonna make a sequel u better make it better then the first if not don't make it all.
If you like thinly veiled anti-communist propaganda, pathetic poorly done special effects, and loads and loads of boring mindless dialogue, then this is the movie for you.
"Dracula & Son" has all of that going wrong to begin with, and then some.
For whatever reason, Columbia Pictures (who picked up the movie for distribution in Britain & America) then had a voice actor re-dub Lee's voice back into English all over again when they finally got around to releasing it in the new world in 1979.
But something just tells me that even then it would still suck.
Story of this movie is good but if they used some technology then they would have make a spectacular film.
Though a sequel to Koi Mil Gaya, it tries to begin a new on several fronts and the lame screenplay never really gets off the ground, except towards the last 15-20 minutes of the film, and by then it's too late.
and then have Spiderman as the sequel.
As a standalone Krrish wouldn't have to waste valuable time telling what happened to Rohit and then trying to bring closure to that in the same film where they are trying to establish a new character entirely.
If you could not tell that the alien is a puppet, then I am sorry for you.
If our troop really were to act as they did in this film; then we would all be doomed.
In one scene we see poachers in misty woods, then suddenly we jump to a band of singers blaring into microphones.
Then we cut to something that looks like Smuckers Rasberry Jelly, then we cut to a kid looking for centipedes, then an RV driving along a road (which they film for about five minutes, just with aerial shots of this RV driving around).
There are three different plots, PLOT A is about a little boy and his family in the wood, PLOT B is about some singers (who sing for 7 minutes then cut back to boy then sing for another 7), finally PLOT C involve some poachers.
The second plot has the singers getting in a fight and one of them going into the forest and getting killed by Trumpy's fellow creature so they take her to a house and then they decide to go to the rangers house and tell them stuff I guess.
**SPOILERS** (not that it really matters)  The beginning is ridiculous, showing clips from the wrong movie, and then once the movie does start, the acting is terrible, and very little things are understandable.
The main characters are a couple of 20-year-olds who are part of an awful band (they have a terrific musical number that is possibly the best part of the movie where the lyrics are incredibly inaudible They go into the mountains for a camping trip, and run into what seems to be some poachers and then find a cabin in which they stay with a family that has one young kid.
Geez, just think about how good, exciting, thought provoking films like "Metropolis" get chopped up so badly to the point of scenes being lost forever, and then released, yet films like this are still released in their original form.
So then an unseen monster comes and kills him.
First, you have poachers, then you have a kid living with relatives of some sort, then of course are the wacky teens going camping.
Well, not all of them, which is unfortunate because then the movie would be over in thirty minutes!
It manages to be obnoxiously preachy and sticky sweet one moment, and then violent, offensive and stupid the next.
However, if you don't think they'll enjoy seeing a guy get hit on the head repeatedly with a brick and have 1000 volts pumped into him while using the sink (that is just SO funny) then you might want to look into something else.
The plan goes badly, however; Mrs. Pollifax is handcuffed to Darren McGavin, then kidnapped by Communists.
The stream becomes a series of rapids and small waterfalls that first damage the canoe, then the bow breaks off while Dr. Jim and Laura, respectively, continue to paddle and scream.
Especially the scene where suddenly there is some kind of earthquake and then they blow up the pass.
When i came to Norwegian channel 3 my yaw dropped to the floor with a loud bang, then i started to laugh and didn't stop until the end credits.
Oh and one of the most annoying things is that when you watch this movie on a channel that doesn't have as many commercialblocks as the American TV stations (one every 10 minutes)you'll get the fade-to-black and then fade-from-black every 10 minutes, which is just put in there for the commercials breaks.
Whenever you see this movie in your programmeguide (it's also know as Marabunta btw) then you've got two options: you either ignore it as hell and live your life further without any memory to this piece of crap nested in your brains, or you can watch it and laugh your socks off due to all the flaws, lousy acting and most importantly: CGI-effects that make the original King-Kong look realistic
And if you're here to see if the TV movie of the night is for you, and it's called KILLER ANTS, then just turn off the TV and find a good book.
Even a bad film made back then on this topic, at least it was unintentionally humorous, though sadly it isn't the case with this one.
The guy lights up his flame thrower (with a tiny little flame) and then from the ground going upwards a flame covers the screen!!!
Then again it is happening into the day of the Christmas, then again Kevin is starting the scuffle after the provocation of the brother, then again he is being told off by the mother, then again he must leave home together with the family, then again is getting lost this time getting the aeroplane mixed up which was supposed to get on then again...
As well then again we are coming across the same nebbish types.
The book is outstanding, her best ever, if you are thinking of renting this movie I urge you to buy a book instead - and if you're not a big reader then you could stick pins in your legs as you watch it, it may help you stay awake.
It just keeps going and going and going and going... "Hey, if we show x number of scenes with Hayward drunk, then maybe she'll win an Oscar!"
The most frequent flaw was the splicing of scenes in which it would appear to be day and then night and back and forth.
Tom goes to the police, and he then realises who the "she" was.
Mary then walks in, and she is somewhat less approving, so Tom desperately tries to make excuses and fails badly ("Is she a model?"
Seriously, how could a teenage girl invite a young boy into a room for an hour and then want the other boys to stone her?
It's blatantly obvious that they're in a sound studio reading their lines which are then haphazardly meshed with the video.
And then there's the scenes in which there's some sort of slaver's convention/party/bat cave, complete with the web servers that have the website for slave flesh speculation.
If, however, you are someone who spends their free time pretending to be a master or Gorean, and have somehow gotten the idea that you have any reason to speak, then this movie is perfect for you.
If you're going to do an adaptation then change stuff (more than just bringing Kryton in early), a genuine american take on the idea not just the script would be interesting.
An absolutely terrible tv show, if you like Red Dwarf then watch the original.  
If you haven't seen the original Red Dwarf then beg, borrow, steal or buy the original (or look for re-runs on PBS) but give this remake a wide, wide berth.  
The film then becomes a "Nobody believes me!"
And IF it's meant "tongue-in-cheek", then it wasn't really entertaining either, the few cynical comments weren't witty enough.
Payton married him when he recovered and then left him seven weeks later for Neal.)
They looking for guys and police blocks the road, then we see them turning right because they go that way for they little day off just before the police setup, you really think the police wouldn't stop them to do a little control?
Mainly all you heard was choppy, barely audible dialog, then crappy background music blaring in the background while scenes skipped around like the west was won.
Well then I might have been interested.
The movie then ended up doing a casting miracle by getting anybody and everybody that people have heard of and that were stupid enough to do the movie.
The movie has a habit of straying then coming back on the topic on hand and then straying again.
When we go through stretches were we have Dhoom, Don, Dhoom 2, and Rang De Basanti and then you get this crap.
Then came Kaal followed by Home delivery, Pyare Mohan, and then Naksha.
I mean at first it was cool, then it become OK this is his thing, and now its just wow your still doing that.
If you can not get Snatch then may be go on and watch this one.
The movie started off really good with the diamond robbery then the film takes you to a lot of different places like flipping through a comic book which was quite irritating.
This anti-racism plot is like having Springtime for Hitler be the main interest of Schindler's list, ie showing the evils of Nazi Germany, then praising it.
One of the wishes gets wasted mistakenly turning a bigot senator into a black man, then another wish spent to turn him back after he learns his lesson and his attitude gets adjusted.
Yes, there is a lot of moralizing here, and if you don't know by now that giving your best weapons to your worst enemies because you are afraid of them is not an intelligent thing to do, then this movie will hammer that obvious point home and do it with a psychopathic vengeance that is firmly rooted in the belief that every dead horse requires a really good beating!
But, then again, with the size of the wagon train and the firm belief that these rifles are excellent protection against hostile Indians, it would have made much more sense to distribute 4 or 6 rifles to each wagon for protection than to leave these vitally necessary items behind packed in crates on a broken down wagon.
But then we wouldn't have a movie, would we?
Let's just give the enemy what they want and go on our way, because then they'll be satisfied and leave us alone.
I like the part when Mr. Duncan gives Kevin McCallister the turtle doves then gives it to a friend to be friends forever.
When Kevin McCallister comes out Duncan's Toy Chest store then also Marv and Harry come out Duncan's Toy Chest then Harry say "So where to next" then Marv says "should we go to the Central Park Zoo" that was hilarouis.
Watch this Christmas movie soon when you buy or have it for a present for Christmas then people all around the world for Christmas will love this Christmas movie.
It tells the story of a middle-aged man who won't grow up and has some affairs with his students and then he falls in love.
Her character in this movie is pretty dull (no surprise there then), she is being portrayed as the beauty who is also profound (well, that's maybe a matter of taste, but I really don't find her that beautiful, and certainly the character was said to be profound, but it was not shown).
But a movie that has basically no substance at all (and just claims to be sophisticated, using all sorts of clichÃ©s etc) and then throws in the dramatic element of a terminal illness to make it a good movie?
He won't commit, yet he is in love with her and never forgets her, whilst she loves him too, but leaves him due to lack of commitment, and then she reappears, telling him she has cancer.
He's not particularly witty, especially for a professor, and he does really annoying things like show up uninvited to spy on her while she's out with her brother and then cover it with a lame excuse.
He waxes poetic about her body, then never even touches her breasts.
Dennis Hopper almost saves the day -- he's the only alive thing in this dud -- and then he dies!
After that, they butchered Peter Sellers's scenes, then replaced him, then replaced him again (Roberto Benigni probably wishes to downplay his role in "Son of...").
His clumsiness works a few times now and then but he's millions of light years away from the stylish act of Sellers.
It worked for about ten minutes until my friend woke me up and said, "If we are going to watch this, then so are you.
While I appreciated the mortality rate of the characters in X (as opposed to the cliches of being beaten down to a pulp but then coming back and winning) it was just like watching meat through a grinder - I didn't care when they went in and didn't care when they came out.
It flew in the face of what little characterization had been created, then the film ends not with a bang but with a half-hearted sigh.
They fly around in one shot, then worry about falling in the next.
They hit eachother with waves of energy and bounce back, then hit each other with waves of energy and die.
But then none of this really comes as a surprise because things have been hairy from the beginning, starting with the half dozen members of the team, a bunch of wise guys goofing on their new leader, a stern Lieutenant Commander wearing the wrong cap (he's one grade below the scrambled-egg level).
Favorite character for obvious reason, but if you like any character other than Kamui or Fuuma, then you're in for the biggest disappointment if you watch this movie.
All in all, I think its an ok introduction to Star Wars, but on a scale from one to five, this movie doesnt deserve more then three.
Dialogue is flat and perfunctory (don't expect to be dazzled by repartee); the story lacks the beauty of the first Star Wars film and the tension of the second ... and then there's the magical `character development' everyone complains about.
There is some meandering action as the Jedis escape the trade federation and pick up Jar Jar on Naboo before heading to Tatooine; then there is meandering action on Tatooine as the Jedis find Anakin and watch him win a pod race; then there is a cool-looking but contextless scene in the Imperial senate; then there is a final battle.
Obi-wan befriends then offers to teach the young man about the force, much like he did with Luke, only the young man is much more aggressive than Luke was.
OK now, the woman we think is the mother is in fact the daughter, except she isn't, she's an imposter, then the father comes back, except it isn't really him, oh and there's rape, incest a hint of paedophilia, oh and there's some Nazi's who gas merkin wearing naked women, oh and one of the family escaped the Nazi's and now she's traumatised by those memories.
Now getting back to the random killings, one of these guys rapes the mother, or was it sister, daughter, I don't think even the director knew, but yeah this girl gets raped and then he gets murdered and the sister who sleeps with the same guy after he raped her mother then gets upset because of his demise.
If you love true Gialli, from the likes of Argento, Bava, Fulci, then simply ignore this film, if you are tempted to purchase or rent it.
Oversentimental, disconnected, melodramatic drivel that plays on what some people think of as Filipino stereotypes, perpetuates them, and then attempts to put them together in one group setting.
Near the end of the film, the cook accidentally sets her apartment on fire and then falls in love with the firemen who saves her, the gay man accidentally mixes up letters to his lover and mother, thus he has to fly back to the Philippines to retrieve the letter containing sexy pics of him and his lover and before his mother finds out - WHEW!!!
If it is a metaphor of sorts, then it failed miserably to put forth the message it wants to convey.
I happens more often then they want to admit, and they never want to admit it's rude, especially since they know English.
If you are fans of either Joan Severance or Peter Riegert, both fine film actors, then perhaps you should pass this one by and look to their other work!
If only the film hadn't exhausted my ability to understand what the point of it was by then.
One to see and then try to forget.
Oh, yeah, my favorite part is Macaulay (Kevin McAllister) was walking around in New York when he was lost then later, he went to the toy store to buy something then these 2 bad guys found him then Macaulay (Kevin) was screaming same thing then run away from these 2 bad guys in the city of NY but it was so funny because I loved Macaulay's screaming that make me laugh so hard!
I admit, the idea is intriguing-- an old man writes a novel about a bunch of lawyers being killed, and then dies himself, but not before showing the book to a disbarred lawyer who claims it as his own & makes a ton of money, but oops!
Ok, so then let's throw in an --ultra-fake-- English accent to distract you from the fact that this man does not walk, talk, fish, or drink like an old man, ie: SLOWLY.
Cuba Gooding Jr. stars in this unusual film about a lawyer who became a plagiarist writer and then a murderer.
Cuba's character then rises to fame and fortune, although I can't imagine what he could have been thinking he would do at this point.
If one believes that every thing is preordained, then that is the only way the plot would have worked, that the characters had no control over their lives.
But then again it sounds sometimes pompous.
Best (or worst) of all this movie boasts the worst disguise since Jane March in 'Color of Night' - if you don't spot it within the first 10 seconds and then work out the whole plot, then shame on you, you're no movie buff.
From an autobiographical point of view, I suppose Mr. Landon wanted to be true to his own experience, but if he merely wanted to base fiction on something that happened to him, then it was less than spellbinding.
The booby traps this time are much more painful and nasty, so it's all the more amusing for us then huh?
Meaning that if you have seen this a dozen times on video then this version chops off the top and bottom of the frame.
And only then does it sound rather basic.
); and then everyone inexplicably QUITS the team for no reason (except, I guess to seem like Badass Rebels That Don't Bow to Authority).
The rest of the film has the principals running around the house accusing each other of one thing or another until we learn the secret of Laura's past and then........................................  Had the director been able to decide whether this film would be played as a straight mystery or a comedy, it had the possibility of being an entertaining little film.
He is then caught by the bumbling cop and the inept reporter wearing a dress (yes, absolutely no reason is given WHY he was wearing a dress, since he had not been seen any time previously in the movie AND it was pretty obvious he was a man in a dress.)
If you like Neil Simon's comedic plays and films, then this is the one to place on your 'must see' list.
There was some mystery in it, but then again, in most cases, it was only a conglomeration of supposedly mysterious elements - that were not that mysterious.
Every now and then the director remembers this is supposed to be a horror film, not a crime caper, so you hear this loopy pseudospooky music that's probably supposed to portend doom, or something.
They make a series of a good book precisely because it's such a good story, and then feel compelled to change the story into a typical formula plot.
I have not seen it since because I hated it then.
What else can you say about a film that brutally murders off the one, decent character whom tries to help others and then resorts to having its lead characters conform to horrific acts of animal cruelty for good measure?
If the film is so interested in the quirky delivery of the study of achieving celebrity fame through infamy then Natural Born Killers sets the bar and Van Sant's 'To Die For' is sub-Natural Born Killers; and Scott's 'Domino' is sub-To Die For which means this film is sub-Domino, which is really scraping the bottom of the barrel given how much I hated Domino.
Since then I have seen this movie several times, and still find it uproariously funny.
Don't get me wrong I love my wife, BUT - kinda jokes, lets make jokes behind the wife then act like a child when shes around.
What is weird is that while the show has obviously turned in to a train wreck, it is still on even though you can tell no one cares anymore... Their daughter has been replaced twice, even going from a brune girl to a blonde girl between 2 episodes, but if you can't tell that it's a sign even the producers don't care anymore then keep watching by all means!
I have never heard about the book (until I read some other comments) but I hope it was better then this.
The wolf in the movie has more personality then all the characters in the film and the only believable character is the crazy kids sister who is also in love with the best friend.
Diego Luna's role was probably one of the characters I've most hated in all cinema history, how are we supposed to care for a character that betrayed his best friend sleeping with his girlfriend, and then betrayed her, sleeping with his best friend's sister, which is another blow towards his friend, who I can understand wants to kill himself being surrounded by such a disgusting bunch of people.
the direction, hr mm it feels like the director just REALLY wanted to get to check out a couple of chicks stripping then making out, and somehow even that looks repulsive in this movie I'm sure some high schooler somewhere is having a fit or questioning my sexuality, but REALLY I am serious when I say that this entire movie would have been better as two minutes of music video when the end comes, and I have to note this doesn't happen soon enough by any definition, you're left with absolutely nothing but the fact that you'd just wasted your time and most likely your money hell like the other guy I bought it in a bargain pack, and STILL felt ripped-off.
Even then, I have enjoyed movies with a similar storyline such as Lal Salaam and The Legend of Bhagat Singh.
And then I waited for the ending to possibly make sense of this crap and they just roll credits?!
If you don't trust me and need proof, then, please, do check out this piece of crap.
But if the original series was so bereft of any distinctive element on which to hang a full length feature, then it only increases the pointlessness of the movie as a whole.
This is one time where the TV series was much more enjoyable then the movie.
My intelligence was offended when 'Starsky' drives his car, like a maniac, out into the public street does a couple of 'donuts' in front of other police cars and then does a 180Âº to pick up his new, unwanted, partner.
If you're a red-blooded male, and find yourself tiring of the so-so horror content, then the ample charms of Cristi Harris, Christine Taylor and Zoe Trilling should put a smile on your face.
If they wanted to make a comedy or spoof then that's what they should of done, and not ruin what could of potentially been a long running franchise.
You see footage of people running around, then it cuts to a man walking to a cabin, he talks to his sister blah blah.
When the guy rides the snowmachine the music track cuts out for 5 seconds then just loops back to the beginning, several times bad editing makes peoples heads jerk around.
Oh yeah, there is one thing I can't understand, who in their right mind decided to order this film then stock it for rental?
invasion of inner earth also known as;they is a extremely bad science fiction movie.we don't see any aliens or flying saucers,not even a pie plate on a string nothing,its a exercise in tedium,but the music on the soundtrack is OK.there are killer flashlight beams however.i don't get it what was directer bill rebane thinking?even the giant spider invasion was entertaining even if it was crappy.and there's no well known actors in this film.is it worth watching?i would have to say no unless you really want to be bored to death.the title does sound promising but really does'nt deliver.this is about 90 minutes ill never get back.but if you like bad dull boring movies then invasion from inner earth is for you,shame on you bill rebane.1 out of 10 awful!
Many of these scenes focus on character development of characters who then proceed to do nothing with their newfound character traits, but others include boring walking and snowmobiling and random cuts to other people doing other things that relate at best tangentially to our friends back at the cabin.
I'm sure the script was too ambitious, considering the monetary means for this movie was obviously limited(..if you are to make an invasion movie, then you have to produce more than colorful steam and red balls of light to convince us of the terror that threatens mankind).
He gets to his NYC hotel six or seven hours late, and his room is gone, because as his reservation CLEARLY stated, after ten o'clock if they don't hear from you, the room is then open to anyone.
He yells at the guy and then HANGS UP!!
and then the camera switches to Nicole who see's her phone ringing and is like "It's Paris."
I mean it's like the kid in your 7th grade class who sings songs into his dad's tape recorder, then he brings them to school and he laughs while the rest of the class just sits there feeling pity and shame for hating someone so much, knowing he's trying to bring laughter to the world, but to spend so much time on something so inconsequential feels karmonically wrong.
It's like someone just took pictures of each page in a children's book with illustrations, and recorded themselves reading it, and then called it an animated production.
The film started reaching for emotional moments it hadn't really earned because they'd never been established during the story and then it tried to cover way too much ground following Dorian from High School to college (in Greenwhich Village yet, where he manages to keep away from men for two years!
And as for that little sister, let me tell you what *she* does: she looks forlorn, cuts herself, starves herself, looks forlorn and hungry, acts like an angel on the altar in the middle of church, passes out during said performance, dot dot dot, and finally jumps out her psych ward window to her death (and if you think I'm being callous then that's because you didn't see the film's eleven second treatment of her death).
And then the teacher....
Hai ram--if you appreciate literature or poetry, if you have any respect for the craft of writing, then you will most likely wince at the trickling treacle that is served to us as (presumably) exemplary writing.
if you want a soft core porn, then this movie might work for you.
It is more of a play then a movie.
He lived in France for awhile as a doorman and wine waiter and then lived in Sweden.
First, when they are on their flight to New York, the pilot says that everyone on board will have to go to Boston (after much time consumed circling over the big city, due to weather conditions), they lose their luggage when they arrive at the Boston airport (and try to find it in a panic, while hurrying to catch a train), they hustle by cab over to one station to board a train, but Gwen has to go to the women's room, but can't find it due to hurrying to make the train (the one they board has no one on but a cleaning lady, and they miss the one they were looking for, which was next to the empty one), then they hustle to another station to get on board one and try to get something to eat on a car with almost no food, they arrive later on at a transit station in New York and discover that all of the transportation services are on strike, so they walk in the rain to their hotel, and Gwen breaks the heel on her shoe while walking before they arrive, only to discover that their room was given away to someone else after the 10 pm deadline, then they walk with a man who helps them find another room (only to rip them off by robbing them at gunpoint, taking George's wallet), then they try to go to the police station to report the guy who scammed them, then go the armory by the police, only to get their route foiled by some liquor store robbers, they get dumped in the park and mugged by a stranger at 4 am while sleeping under a tree (George's watch was taken while he was sleeping), then they find Cracker Jack on a bench for breakfast (that a dog steals almost immediately, which George breaks a tooth on, causing him to whistle on his spoken S's), they get chased by a cop on horseback for an assumed problem with a child in the park, and more funny situations to come.
After a few more mishaps, they finally make it to their same hotel destination with their luggage brought back earlier, thanks to the airport in Boston, but George can't get his suitcase unlocked due to the fact that the scam guy from the night before has his key in his wallet, then George goes to his interview, making it on time, in spite of his disheveled appearance (and he thought he wasn't going to make it due to the strike).
But, then they realize that New York is not the place for them to live, so they go on back home.
You know a movie has misfired when despite such notable actors it goes through so many desperate name changes: Debuting as "The Grotesque" (its source name), barely released to theaters as ""Gentlemen Don't Eat Poets," then to video as "Grave Indiscretions."
The description of the symptoms is that first you break into uncontrollable laughter, then you become frenetic, and then, your mind altered, you do insane things.
Also, there were no deep intakes of the weed which is then held a bit before expelling the smoke - no, these people were smoking this stuff like cigarettes except they weren't inhaling.
Let's start with handsome Dave O'Brien as Ralph, one of the older procurers of the young, who then introduced kids to this powerful substance.
It all comes to a head when sweet Mary finds herself compromised by a craven Bogarter and then murdered.
But in its day these insipid ravings allowed then kinda drug czar Harry Anslinger to develop a cottage industry to employ jobless revenue agents who lost their meal ticket with the end of Prohibition.
At first everything went to plan, and I remained on schedule; then Â with a dull droning sound, like that of a whimpering animal Â my computer suddenly took it upon itself to shut down for no apparent reason.
One man smoking a marijuana cigarette, cups his two hands around the cigarette and then blows out enormous amounts of smoke - obviously not even inhaling.
If you've never seen it, then don't consider yourself well rounded.
Mickey gets knocked over by a milk truck driven by dairy magnate Malcolm Trevor (Cary Grant), and Letty, Mickey, and a shady lawyer try to get damages, but somebody's taken film of Mickey running and jumping, so they throw the case out of court and Mickey gets taken away, first by matrons, and then by the soft-hearted Trevor.
Then the scheming Letty tries to get her son back by fascinating TrevorÂeasily doneÂbut the noble response of the wife, first in not making a fuss, and then saving Mickey from drowning in the swimming pool, changes her mind.
If anyone gives an outstanding performance then it's Clive Owen as Richard , you almost feel sorry for him as he realises the relationship is over but seeing as the relationship is with a blood relative you may as well feel sorry for Adolph Hitler in that case
A primal no-no of screen writing is the over-use of time jumps, you know, when there is 1 minute of action then a flash on the screen telling is "two years later" etc.
fan then you'll be in hog heaven!
My then 19 year old Son and I watched this movie on television about a year or so ago.
Of course I was about 7 then but nonetheless it was the ultimate for many people of my generation, and then we grew up but perhaps it is that I have grown up that I didn't enjoy this one wanting a film for adults.
Why does a changeling keep it's face and not get a new one then try to kill Kenobi.
The sound though is superb, watching at home on my Dolby 5:1 did make it a bit more of an experience but if you are relying on technical details to carry a film then you really shouldn't be making it to start with.
Anyone can buy a decent sound engineer for a movie, and just be limited by budget but not anyone can get a good performance out of an actor, then the limit is talent.
He's no great director or writer and should leave that to others, perhaps then we can get the Star Wars movies that we all want, and perhaps he can come to rival the grosses of the old films again but I fear the magic will have gone by then.
The battle droids were bad enough in episode one, but then Lucas had to revive the walking scrap heaps for this one too, in which they were much dumber, and more boring, even the new, re-vamped "super battle droids".
Wait until it appears on DVD then at least you can edit it down to a three minute Natalie Portman fashion shoot and fifty seconds of yoda break-dancing.
So they just cut at on end then the other coming up with a film that more a glimpse than anything with a story.
This then presents some issues.
There is nothing original about the film but then who needs originality.
"The Defiant Ones," a truly great film was first, and then this one followed.
Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis play off beautifully against each other in this tale of two misbegotten and forlorn visitors to the Big Apple who suffer every indignity that can befall two out-of-towners, and then some.
Yet another jokey gangster film which proliferated the screens in the wake of BONNIE AND CLYDE (1967); the ragtime score, then, is clearly inspired by the recent success of THE STING (1973).
Portia de Rossi tries hard, but is hobbled by the bad script (it is, for example,not well explained why she is so good with a gun, and then not well utilized when push comes to shove).
She then walks out of the fairground not realizing she's trailing a loose wire and is talking to herself.
Then, if things couldn't get worse, the crooks take over the cop car with George and Gwen still inside and then decide to dump them in the middle of Central Park.
* Augustus was much more scruplesless then in this Movie shown.
At times, the actors seem as if they were in completely different movies which were then edited together.
If you find Rome an abomination, a foul mouthed screw-fest of little historical accuracy, then you might enjoy Imperium: Augustus.
But, if you feel Rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the complicated intrigue, the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors, then Imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid, superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors.
But then...
If you like watching a 94 minute brawl through a scrapyard then watch it.
I mean, those movies ARE clichÃ©s, and if you then have clichÃ©s from them clichÃ©s... well, you understand.
If the budget would've been bigger (or at least better used), the clichÃ©s fewer and the name another, then this movie could've been OK.
It hits just about every cheesy gimmick that a low budget sci-fi-action-thriller can, and then more.
When every character in a movie can't get a clue, ESPECIALLY the two young lovers, then any alleged plot becomes meaningless.
The scrawny weakling trying to play tough was pretty funny, and then the cry-baby "please I don't deserve thiiiss" sequences had me in stitches.
In hindsight, it probably would have been best to end the film shortly after he finds love, as up until then it was a rather decent (if "boobified") film.
Of course, things start going wrong, beginning with the flight to New York, which is first put into a holding pattern because of excessive traffic, then later sent to Boston because of the weather.
They fly around the country using the sparse equipment on board to basically create a television program, S&M TV, and then interrupt legitimate broadcasts with their pirate signal.
Anyway, they get there through a generic boosting an atrocious "this-is-the-incongruous-love-song-theme-get-use-to-it-it'll-come-back-throughout" and then the legacy unveil itself, literally.
If it isn't a coincidence, then what is it?
If that's your cup of tea, then you will probably like this film.
She morns him for a while then decides to just "have fun" with multiple partners and no commitments.
However, once plot and character development come into swing, then the movie just falls flat on its face.
but bill paxton is great especially when he is pointing his rife at anthony m. hall and his pretty blonde girlfriend, and he bangs hall's head with the nozzle and then bangs the girl in the head.
Let's build a village, put some people there and then some evil men who shoot them.
If you want to see one and a half hour of people getting killed then this is your movie.
But until then the Weinstein brothers will continue to bring these pretty stupid films to other Audiences other than just the Thai nation.
Seriously... if you have "Mein Kampf" or the communist manifesto - sit down and go through them rather then wasting time on this movie!!!
Since then I've done my best to put the painful memories of both behind me.
He followed that up with more success in Officer and a Gentleman (1982), which is not holding up well by the way, but then what?
He might have made it tolerable had he tried, but trust me, watching Sterling Hayden run about in a wig is much more compelling then enduring Connery's uninspired speeches in a "medieval" hair piece!
Until then recognition of both friend and enemy alike was by banners etc., and was all a bit of a hit and miss affair (just like this movie in fact).
Not only does Godard torture the viewer on purpose, beginning right after he questions Allen about his then recent release of Hannah and Her Sisters with abrupt recurring title cards meant to scoff at Allen's film and segueing without direction into random and exasperatingly repetitive moments where music swells to the point where it drowns out the clearly uncomfortable Woody and displays inexplicable freeze frames of indeterminable screen time.
And then why does Godard have the big head where Woody knowingly demotes himself?
And also unfortunate, because what would have been an interesting question is then quickly brushed over.
this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself.I first saw the trailer in 1991, it looked great.Since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it.....until today, yes, 14 years later.
If you saw this movie and hated it, then you can redeem those two hours of your life by watching the amazing sequel on youtube.com.
If you haven't seen this movie and want to, then save two hours and watch the five minute sequel.
Unless you are a glutton for opera (very high-pitched opera, by the way), then this film will be, at best, barely a time-passer and nothing more.
If, like me, you liked _Love and other catatastrophes_, then you'll probably like this too.
Bent cops then chase them to get their money.
If True Romance had never been made then it may achieve a 6 or 7.
I would usually never write a review in the first place, but if I can spare someone 1.5 hours of their life then writing this will have been worth it.
The performances are compelling: whiny Gregory Caridi as Eugene holds the thing together with a repellent charm; the dynamic duo of John Yost and Greg Johnstone (as Stanley and Quentin, respectively) always entertain; Kristin Pfeifer as the titular "Bitch" is so outlandishly evil you can't help but laugh; and then there's Jason Steele--his performance as George is something to behold.
The story is set earlier, in the 50's; but you can see that even then, people had more semblance of civilization that the dismal one-step-up-from-HeeHaw that "Harlan County War" portrays.
It does have kind of a nice ending but, by then, I was so totally bored I didn't care.
i thought maybe they hyped it up and it was gonna suck,then the previews came on and they were all for local indie movies some of them looked OK and the the other were just horrible.
then i thought to myself wow this movie might be really bad, but i laughed my a** off from beginning to end.
Lise, thus far not experienced in the ways of the flesh, has a crush on Gwen that is not returned, and then punishes Gwen for spurning her interest by sabotaging Gwen's "romances".
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***  This story had great potential (young salesclerk wrongfully convicted of stealing gets sentenced to 3 years in prison, then emerges from prison seeking revenge on her boss and the prosecutor who sent her to prison).
He realizes while trying to kiss her that she's a virgin, then respectfully backs off and gives her some money for a cab.
Okay Tony Todd maybe took thing a bit too seriously (he's way too intense) and the cinematographer was very serious about America Olivo's breasts, but other then that this seems to be a joke...except its not, or if it is it never signals that it it is.
Oh, yeah, and then there was the sound.
Well, they make a very very bad movie, worst then D movie, and too late, they saw what a mistake it was.
What do they do then?
F/x is totally worst then zero.
I can see why and, if you aren't hung up on a nostalgia trip or your best judgment tainted by seeing your favorite 80s stars in a relatively unknown film, then you'd know why, too.
If its not the the dubbing then perhaps its the editing and direction which appears to have taken the "lets use every piece of available footage" approach to film construction.
The first half of the film is basically setting up the romance and the war, and then in the second half you mostly see Steve Reeves running for what seems like 15 minutes, and then a huge naval battle with some interesting underwater photography.
The only way I can bear to view this program is to turn the sound off - even then I'm forced to see his ridiculous gestures as he dominates the screen.
One can appreciate the artistic quality of the film (it's obvious that the filmmakers cared deeply about this film) and its rich cinematography, but the film still tries too hard to be different and then gives up and whimpers to an end without making much of a statement.
But then again, maybe he really is an angel, and he has found his kind and can now return home.
And then I thought "Wow-- somebody made a movie even dumber and more irritating than "Magnolia".
I've had a bad night.Firstly Brick and then Miami Vice.My daughter told me Vice was rubbish i usually follow her advice but i was a fan of the TV shows and Michael Mann is one of my favourite directors so i watched it.She was right this time,but not always,she did recommend Brick but thats another post.
Movie was made, but that movie isn't that good.In the movie "Miami Vice" we've got lots of famous people,like director Michael Mann,actors Colin Ferrell,Jamie Foxx,Naomie Harris and lots more.Producers succeeded to hire big shot stars on this movie so they can replace actors from series.But they couldn't.Script of the movie is not that bad and we all know what Michael Mann is capable to do but it didn't work with this film.First of all this movie is too long.It is so long that I almost fall asleep in the cinema.Second,actors like Collin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are good actors but they cannot pull this one on their back.Collin Farrell is trying to be different from Don Johnson but he just can't do it.Don Johnson is so much better then Farrell in this role.Jamie Foxx played well,although I don't like him as an actor.And also I have to say that these two actors are good choice but why did they made this movie?To bring them money.There are lots of locations but why do they call it "Miami Vice" when the plot is not set in Miami.They could call it "World Vice" instead.I didn't enjoyed in this movie,but maybe my expectations where too big.I like Mann's camera and he really knows his job.The things I didn't liked where some scenes where Ferrell could do a better job and I also don't know why is this movie so long.It gets boring toward the end.Even though this movie has lot of famous people, it hasn't got some thing so I can say that movie is fine.It lacks of magic.
A cinÃ©ast friend tells me that the film has been credited for a number of inventive film effects, but then he has not read the book.
if you're looking for a fun independent movie then give why we had to kill bitch a try.
the first 2 min are ok then the opening credits come on and are about 5 min with the worst music i ever heard in my life.
then there are like 7 kills in like 10 min too much too fast.
If a plastic bag is then put over your head, and your hands are free, poke a hole so you can breathe (or take it off).
The last 15 minutes are good, stuffed with gory massacres and explicit make-up effects, but it's too late by then.
He looks like he's brain-dead and then suddenly remembers that he's tough and cool.
I'll do it then.'
So much for the premise...  What have we got left then?
It starts of with a guy farting in another guy's face, then some guy's literally melting away and we think, okay, that's what the movie's going to be about.
At first he was a bit of solvent sniffer and then just hours after trying a bit of coke he is raiding a medicine cabinet just to get high.
If you understand those two points, then you already know everything The Basketball Diaries is trying to tell you.
If you think the drug issue is any more complex than that, then prepare to be disappointed by this movie.
then she meets jim carrey's character: a failing comedian dish washer.
then the climax.
Even then, he's not that funny (which is more of a script problem than an acting problem).
Add to this the bizarre fact this "actor/director" never made another movie and dropped off the face of the Earth into obscurity, which then begs the question, who actually funded this robotic disaster epic, and why?
Just as a quick note to the viewers, the filmmakers then had the clock read 4:50, as if to say, "Please, it's not too late for you, turn off the TV and RUN!"
Gesswein says that ROTOR will be ready in 25 years, then says he needs at least 4.
And then you will make all of your friends watch it...and you will love me once more.
And then there are bad movies that are just plain incompetent.
Yes it is, but if the punishment for speeding was death then we'd all drive a little more carefully.
If a motorcycle cop who looks like a bulimic Ned Flanders ever stops you, then run for your life!
They arrive at a fully-decorated-for-the-holidays cabin-in-the-woods to meet a friend, the less-attractive one takes a LONG shower to demonstrate she is pierced in more than one spot, the cute girl walks around outside for an eternity and then bops around in lingerie and a Santa hat for another 5 or so minutes.
By then end, the opium addict is a complete and total mess and he begins quoting Bible verses about the danger of alcohol--as he calls out to God and then kills himself.
Here, then, we ostensibly have the case history (cue exhaustive exposition in the form of title cards) of a doctor who indulged in various types of drugs, starting out with opium (suggested by the stereotypical wise-yet-evil Chinese) but soon progressing to heroinÂall of which ends with him losing everything (living in a two-bit dive and eventually turning a gun on himself!).
He then meets beautiful Mary Dale (May McAvoy) who helps him become a big star.
Oops, I guess we'd have to wait another half a decade or so for that and by then both of the singers from this movie were long gone, too bad it would have at least been interesting..
Oops, I guess we'd have to wait another half a decade or so for that and by then both of the singers from this movie were long gone, too bad it would have at least been interesting.
What then can be said about a film that is well known for being the first talkie (wellÂ that's not technically true, it's more a synchronized film) in film history?
If I have to mention a good thing, it could be the rotating camera angels at the beginning, but then again is this not standard in most movies?
I was going to look this up to see if it was real, but then realized I don't care.
Oh my dear god, please people, before slating any other film please watch this one first, who in their right mind eats a banana in the bath and then tries to feed some of it to their dog??????
This takes ages to get started and by then interest ebbs away to the point where you just end up staring at the screen blankly.
From then on, the two no longer await a boring trial and they make sure every villain's live quickly comes to a bloody end.
And then still this movie fails to impress because of its many boring sequences and the completely illogical structure featuring at times.
I found rebecca to just be simply ridiculous she delivered her lines with the expressiveness of dried paint, she tried to be the quirky yet cute girl next door, then the dark broken stoner girl, roles few can pull off.
if you're a fan of the games then you may notice a few set pieces from resident evil two, the police a station and the gun shop are among the most obvious and there are a few corridor/alley way shots that a ripped straight from the game, other than that it strays so far from the original source material,if you don't know the games then you'd be forgiven in thinking the game was something of a devil may cry ilk.
still if you like formulaic,dated horror action films then you'll lap it up if not then it'll do as post pub fodder.
and if you don't drink then there may be nothing to stop its mediocrity depressing you, and making you wish you'd done something more worthwhile with an hour and a half
had put more of what's in the games into the film then Apocalypse would have been halfway decent.
And then Nemesis dies by having a helicopter crash land on him?
The plot seems interesting for two seconds there but then suddenly Roberts starts pulling a gun and stuff and the movie just keeps getting worse and worse.
The FBI, or whatever it's called in this movie, try to let everybody think he gets captured, and then gets free again to improve his popularity.
But then some terrorists real capture him, and it's up to "The Replacement", or "The guy in the tuxedo" to rescue him.
It goes to another angle, and then we only see his face.
Unfortunately, then finding out that the President didn't authorize anything and that it is the Cia and then not really the CIA and that Eric Roberts is some anti gravity, bullet dodging hero ends any  integrity the movie started out with.
The effects are ridicules, especially the weapons effects the Special Forces in the beginning of the movie are firing m-16s at the attackers but they seem to hit none, zero then finally they hit the attackers keep in mind that they are using full auto and they are facing each other!!!
but the worst scene was when the attackers moved in a small room and the special forces attacked them by entering the room firing rapidly with their m16s and some how they did not hit anyone then the attackers used a smoke grenade to push the special forces outside the small room.
I saw the original movie years and years ago, then read Chriton's book.
In the second part, we get some cursory mention of the two survivors and some theorizing as to why they may still be alive... but then they're simply forgotten and don't even figure in the overall plot.
Why is it that Hollywood chooses to remake perfectly good movies and then make them worse when they do?
I saw this movie when it came out in 1979 (ironically at the same drive-in theater I managed in 1990) and it scared the daylights out of me then, and it still creeps me out today!
The appearance of Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies and then Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon piqued my interest in the lady's earlier films and when this one came up cheap on DVD, I jumped at the chance to acquire it.
If you like mindless action with a touch of humour, then you could do a lot worse than this film.
IF the movie was made by a High School Drama Team... then OK... good work.
Again... if it was done by a bunch of High School drama students... then great!
Even if decently edited to tighten up the pacing, there's then the problem of reeediculous plot devices that were added to this adaptation.
(Trekkie alert: as a C-list actor, Schenkkan is best remembered for eating an alien cockroach and then getting his head blown up, when he played Commander Remmick in the ST:TNG first-season episode "Conspiracy".)
If you've seen the "updated remakes" of Rollerball, The Time Machine, Planet of the Apes, The Invaders, War of the Worlds, The Haunting, Lost in Space, and Battlestar Galactica and liked them, if you like the contrived derivative science-fictiony mini-series "Taken", then you'll like this.
And then there's Jack Nash running around looking for Grace (oops, wrong series).
And then we have all the secret bad government daring-do, a predictable addition in these times.
How else would you explain their top billed stars, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Peter Facinelli, starting as main characters, then switching to comic relief.
If you have seen Phantasm and didn't like it I recommend watching Phantasm II then giving the original another try (mind you if you didn't like the first one you probably aren't reading this review).
That's why J.Edgar Hoover didn't even LET his agents go undercover: no way, back then.
But she was involved w/ schlock-/ fluff-meister Cameron then and he wrote the script.
But it doesn't even end there: There's the no-parachute scene about; then Reeves tracks his man all over; then there's a confrontation where he lets him go to die in some big weather.
The setting is perfect- San Francisco, then and now the actual witch capital of the world (I should know, I live one hour away from the vortex of arcane power).
If you've only seen an old, crappy video rental and dismissed this as "some lame 70s flick" then you have not experienced the glory that is  PHANTASM.
Check out the special edition LD or DVD, then maybe you'll learn to appreciate PHANTASM and give it the respect it deserves.
Of course, I was also younger when I started watching, and my tastes have developed a good deal since then.
Back then, the episodes were rather grounded and serious.
They simply prattled on about how evil they were, laughed manically for a while, and then tried to kill people for no real reason besides the fact that they felt like it.
Also i feel as though the show cared more about the ratings and the number of viewers then they cared about the viewers that this would upset.
The scenes are built up as if you sat in the theater - long shots from one side, only with few closeups now and then.
A guy meets a girl, "bangs" her senseless, then stops seeing her.
The same guy later meets another girl, "bangs" her senseless, then stops seeing her.
If you've had a dozen or so one-night stands and wish to reminiscence about the "good ole days", then you'll probably like this movie.
If the director actually gave me some content to help me understand why these people live this way and how that lifestyle affects them, then I'd surely enjoy it more.
If someone is willing to project that much meaning into Turning Gate, then you surely must give a movie like Show Girls the same consideration.
I resent directors like Hong who entice me with one good entry, only to then clobber me over the head with three steaming piles of pig manure.
Starts off promisingly enough, but then it takes AGES for anything important to happen.
I found myself fast forwarding through parts of it and even then the film was slow.
After a half hour I started fast forwarding, then skipping sections to see if anything would happen and there was LOTS of bad acting and still whatever I'd skip to was long and boring and finally I couldn't watch anymore.
But then......so much drama and angst and just bore.
We get a whole pile of them at the beginning of the movie, then when she's whining and crying and relating the whole story to her boyfriend, we get a whole pile of them again.
Bottom line: bad acting, worse script - would have been more satisfying to see everyone killed in the first five minutes and then watch the monster wander around aimlessly in the woods for a few hours.
It started off well but then it went all wrong for me.
This film wants to be a drama, a love story, sci-fi movie and action extravaganza all at the same time, and then just screws up everything.
But then, it is a comic-book-movie.
Even if you're not a harsh as I am about this film, then let's at least agree that in the history of cinema, surely we can find at least 250 films that are better than this one.
One girl is a criminal, then she isn't, but she's here.
If you're looking for a forgettable time killer or just like watching veteran actors making mountains out of mole hills then by all means give it a shot.
If you like Lou Gossett Jr., then watch this film.
This movie continues to be the only movie I have ever walked out on...I watched up to the point where his fly buddy that is up there when he gets killed sits down with the Russians to plan the attack to take place later in the film and then I couldn't take it anymore...I never saw what happens next, nor do I ever care to find out.....
The LGJ-Scene is like in Iron Eagle I and Toy Soldiers where there's some kid who's in waaaaaay over his head and the guys in charge are about to give up, but then LGJ says...  "This kid is different!
`If Doug was capable of obliterating a country the size of Wales or the State of Washington and he'd just been shot down by some naughty communist, then surely a single Soviet pilot could wipe out the entire USA!'
I've seen Red Dawn, so I know how easy Russians are to kill and this film failed to realise that But to make matters worse, the Americans then team up with the Russians to attack a small Middle Eastern country together!
The fun fact is the Plymouth HemiCuda is a rad car back then, and still is now.
If its not slapstick anime where its easy to have the females kicking around the 'perverted' weak males then they'll just do anything to make females the leads and in charge and by far the stronger and more pure and innocent sex in the more powerful anime.
It starts with them being fraudulent with a stone in a mobile phone box that they then shrink-wrap and sell for $27 - supposedly for dog food - burgers!.
If you are a dog lover, and a serious one (moderate dog lovers won't love the dogs enough to get past story and acting flaws), then you may enjoy the bits where the dogs act cute.
If you want to feel like Beavis and Butt-head when they watch something undescribable on TV, then this is the movie to create this emotion.
It was pretty gross and freaked me out back then.
Garrett Morris makes a short appearance, but he was actually better in "Car Wash" then in this campy horror flick.
He manages to get brother Jody and their friend Reggie roped into believing what he's seen, and trying to find out what The Tall Man is up to, and then how to stop him.
And if the acting is not top drawer from a then no-name cast, at least the performances are somewhat natural and not over-acted.
Everything that the old films built up over the first four films and then maintained steadily through no less than nine entries is picked up, raised high in the air, ungentlemanly dropped and repeatedly jumped on, until there is nothing of the magic left, and everything that was once great about this franchise is destroyed beyond recognition.
The very ending, the last of the film does possess a single clever comment... but by then, it's much, much too late.
Aaargh, but then his daddy's been killed in the army, so maybe he's not so awful after all.
But then later on, to wit a touching, sentimental moment when he has a heart to heart and then loses his virginity to a prostitute?!?
And then there's Dudikoff, who we have every reason to believe is a drug dealer until about a quarter of the way into it.
Cool, but still so super fast and therefor less cool then it could have been.
Most parts when they are trying to make it look like something is falling into place, it looks like they shot it falling (or CGI'd it) then shot a seperate cut with it in place.
But on the other hand is better then most of the movies from Slovenia, who are filled with depressing characters and story without any bright ideas.
I sort of enjoyed it, but then, it had no competition and I wasn't ready to fall asleep yet.
I don't even remember what Sharon Stone looked like naked, but then, to be fair, she was covered up a lot of the time.
To people interested in the story: (SPOILERS AHEAD) This film is about a graveyard dude who crunches dead people to a height of 3 feet, revives them and then uses them as slaves in some sort of 'other galaxy'.
Other then that though, the movie is hideous and hideously dull.
If you want to see these actors nude (And seek help if you want to see Sly in the buff) then watch Basic Instinct or one of his pornos, chances are you'll find better stories there.
I swear the guy thought he was doing Shakespeare, inserting needless pauses into his lines and never wavering from an absurdly solemn tone (Business as usual then for his worst work, only worse) The user who likened this to "The Red Shoe Diaries" pretty much nailed it.
Phantasm contains other (already legendary) elements such as the deadly flying spheres that plant themselves into the victim's forehead and then perpetrates the brain.
Just then, Mitsu walks in and announces that Norinaga will attack in the morning!
Mitsu then tells Lord Norinaga that Whit is holding the Sacred Scepter.
But it is quite frustrating seeing the characters do no more than go to the cemetery and go home, then go to the cemetery and go home for, more or less, the entire running time.
Man, I wish I were a kid back then.
Michaelangelo is cool with the idea, but wonders if they had pizza back then.
The movie opens with a fight in 16th century Japan that doesn't make any sense, then what we get is the Turtles dancing to ZZ Top.
because we didn't know these characters from the cartoon show and they don't look cool there just siting on a horse shooting guns and ones the gos guy and other is the bad guy and the Michaelangelo gets kidnapped witch keep the turtles back April as well gets set back in time where her and mike and prisoners and the turtles costumes just look so awful it isn't funny and there is only a couple fight scenes not involving all the turtles until the end at least the previous films had more then one for scene with all the turtles more then once so as you can see they pretty much went wrong where ever this is buy far the worst tmnt film as well as it being one of the worst films and let downs ever and goes to show that most three's in a sequel flop the first,second and fourth tmnt films are all great so lets just pretend the fourth is the third and leave this horrible film as a past and killed off memory.
The third outing for out heroes in a half-shell (if you don't know about them by now then start at the beginning before even attempting to endure this) provides us with some time travel shenanigans as the quartet find themselves being transported to ancient Japan to fight some angry folk and rescue April O'Neil (played once again by Paige Turco).
Honestly, I was a fan, but then I started to hate the turtles, only because of THIS MOVIE!
But then I saw it again recently (a few years ago), and it made Batman and Robin seem uplifting by comparison.
Oh dear, if you're diabetic then I would seriously advise against watching this film.
The plot goes one way, then changes 180 degrees.
He then reanimates the bodies and transforms them into stunted little creatures so he can transport them into his dimension.
It's almost like watching an early television variety show where they come on at intervals, do a sketch, then depart.
FF7 was less then average at best.
Why is it popular then?
While attempting to make a comedy with some sense of purpose or message is a noble and bolder undertaking then most comedies (especially screwball comedies of the 30s/40s) were willing to attempt.
Strangelove', or perhaps more to the point 'Network' and 'The Player' accomplish this task much more successfully then 'Sullivan's Travels' does.
Was it the part where Veronica Lake pushes McCrea into the pool, and then she falls in, and the butler walks up and...well you know the rest.
Oh by the way, the little joke I made in the first two lines of this review, is funnier then anything in 'Sullivan's Travels'.
The movie is extremely boring, then at the end the movie explains how they were able to pull it off, when it was blatantly obvious the entire time.
If this had been done by Merchant Ivory then she might have fitted right in but it wasn't and she didn't.
They are rich because they know how to get money and then how to hold on to it.
He gets a new face and tries to discover who really killed his wife and then his best friend.
Perhaps that was interesting then, but I felt it added nothing to the movie.
Edge in a Triple Theat Matchin a good match, then again it might have only looked good because of the lameness that came bore.
Worse then a women's match (if such a thing is even possible) Simply horrid 0/10.
Also just when you think everything will be ok, it takes a new twist - everything then doesn't seem to make any sense at all.. and you just leave the cinema muttering "what was that all about".
I decided not to post a review then, as I assumed that there was no way the film would be released as it was, considering the reaction of the test audience.
The quintuplet then embark upon a mostly tedious journey to Manchester, where Major West (Ecclestone) resides over a military base.
First i'll start off with what i liked, then i will continue with a list of loopholes and other points that ruin this movie.
-If these infected people are so vicious and all they do is blood lust, then why do they not attack each other.
-So if the infected are supposed to be vicious and killing machines, then why are there no corpses on the streets?
-If the infected kill because they have "rage" and not for eating the people, then what do they eat to survive.
-This is what really doesn't make sense: If these military guys have the radios to send out a strong broadcast, then why would they not be able to pick up transmissions from other countries that are not infected?
-If there are other countries that are not infected, then why would none of them be concerned with finding survivors in Britain.
If they do this at the end by flying over the country side with a jet, then why would the military guys never see a plane that would give them hope that the rest of the world is OK.  -Apparently a scrawny bike carrier can undermine 8 or 9 trained military personnel.
He somehow gets back onto the property unnoticed (which nobody has been able to do yet), then he sneaks around the property like some sort of ninja, then moves throughout the house without running into any of the military guys or any of the infected military guys.
If you like cheesy horror films that follow the same mass produced guideline over and over again, then this is your flick.
But if you're looking for some entertainment value...something that will peak your interest for at least 2 minutes, then you definitely need to stay away from this one.
And the movie finale leaves you with more of sense of "Thank God it's over", then "Wow, I can't believe she made it."
I'm not a gore-hound by any means, but if seeing plastic heads repeatedly slashed at is your thing, then you will be in for a treat.
The best sequence in "Butchered" occurs early on, when two girls are spanked with paddles by two other girls and then are forced to do "squishy" push-ups (you'll see what that means), as part of a sorority initiation.
First they undergo a little spanking , then they do some push-ups with a cream all over their bras.
And then there's the score to the film, which is equally as effective and just as chilling.
), and her partner, Jason Blade (Edward John Stazak) takes charge from then on.
But then I hadn't seen Carry On Behind, which makes "Buses" seem the height of sophistication.
If you learn that a subplot involves a large hungry dog and a Minor bird that swears and says "show us yer knickers" then you'll see the level of the "humour".
Though then again, the warning signs should show when it opens with a theme song by Kenny Lynch.
So, if it's a rainy winter's afternoon, you're not feeling well, there's nothing on any other TV channel and you PC is broken, then watch this... it'll pass the time.
If a geriatric Sid James going on a camping holiday to try to 'get off' with his 33-year-old girlfriend in 'Carry On Camping' seemed out of date for 1969, then watch this desperate rehash with your thumb poised above the fast forward button: Swedish stunner Elke Sommer sets off with fellow archaeologist Kenneth Williams (passable, but the same) on a hunt for missing pieces to a naughty Roman mosaic buried underneath a caravan site in the summer season.
He is then pardoned and finds the serum works...but it turns him into a cold-blooded killer which he has no control over.
Nothing here has been improved upon from the original the first remake, and if you've seen either, then this is completely unsatisfying.
But Donald Pleasance is adrift, mostly acting detached and insipid, then suddenly erupting in a panic outburst or frantically pawing in a snuff box.
The only other memorable performance is by Pat Evison as the psychic grandma (of course, these psychic abilities are mentioned early on and then just dropped).
Since neither of them wants to do it, and they have an empty bed in their dormitory suite, they look for a depressed underclassman to befriend, and then try to push over the brink.
Bodies are disappearing from coffins; a lady in lavender has sex with men in the graveyard and then stabs them to death; little midgets in brown cloaks (making sounds like lions) are roaming about and there's a flying silver orb with spikes that embeds itself in people's heads!
And then there's the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) overseeing it all...Soon Mike, Jody and their friend Reggie (Reggie Bannister) are fighting for their lives...
If you liked DMOC (Dead Man on Campus) then you should enjoy 'The Curve'  Btw they both came out in the same year.
I didn't think it was close to Animal House, but then again, it is just my opinion.
It was called David stockwell's ghost where a husband violently beat his wife and then afterwards it was like as if it didn't happen.
In my opinion don't watch this series because it can put ideas into peoples heads about how to physically abuse women in one episode, but then confuse you by saying it's wrong in another episode.
Seconds turn to minutes then before long a couple of hours are gone and you'll start thinking that you should have spent the time fixing the dishwasher or washing the dog.
Each climbing scene takes a couple of minutes then it is off to another "personal account" interview with the actual people who the story is about.
If you know the story then the prolonged agony portrayed by the actors doesn't create any suspense like it might if you didn't know the outcome.
Perhaps this is a film that is esoteric by design and if that is the case then perhaps I should just watch it over and over again until I do have some sort of puerile grasp of it.
And if theories are unproven then what is stop you from believing that this movie could really be the answer to those questions?
If you are truly looking for a cheesy, horribly made film, then there is no better then The Evil Dead.
If you're in to demons, then you should probably skip this one and rent Night of the Demons!
So if you want to watch a really bad thriller with some decent actors (including Ronny Cox and John Marley) embarrassing themselves then get some popcorn, sit back, relax, and prepare to either laugh your head off or be properly disgusted at the cheap product on the screen.
In 1998 three young White men killed James Byrd, Jr., a Black man, by chaining Byrd to the back of their pickup truck, and then driving away at high speed down a back road in rural deep East Texas.
Instead of singing long numbers and perhaps dancing or getting into the moment, instead the characters sang a line or two or three from a song and then very abruptly stopped.
It starts with some alien background, then it just moves to action.
I mean there are bad movies and then there are bad movies, this one beats them all to the pole.
I guess if you like English movies with no depth, bad effects, bad acting but a lot of fighting and shooting then you could watch this, otherwise just leave it...  p.s.
If you still think your discovery holds after you've gotten a good scientific background knowledge, then you should have also gotten to know some people with whom you can discuss it...
to name but a few and this merry-go round starts spinning at incredible speed with the arrival of a prisoner-patient ,who is emitting a sort of religious aura-energy ,and is immediately christened by one of the prisoners as Saint Chrostopher ,who has finally arrived to save them Â From something ÂAnd then we are left to witness and sigh with bottomless wonder and awe at the endless walks through corridors ,suspiciously resembling the interiors in the Cube series ,and a trio of aforementioned controllers ,who are supposedly controlling somethingÂFrom someone Â And then the course of the ship is changed ,and Â the volcano-looking planet ,around which the station rotates,is transformed through the ' deus-et-machina ' intervention by the aforementioned Saint-dude into an Earth-looking planet no less !
and then going on to raise the dead , OK but then what happened to the rest of the crew this film did not make any kind of sense , and the end well who knows
But then the story sets in and it all goes downhill.
The only redeeming part of this movie is after he rescues the Indian from under the floorboards with the key, and then the rat jumps out, as if from nowhere!!
But then we decided to watch this movie, I really became excited because I thought that the movie was really going to be like the book.
If you're on Death Row with two hours left, then this truly is the film for you; but all others should really steer clear.
There's a gay sex scene that lasts about 10 minutes, an extremely bloody bathtub murder, a couple of detectives, another murder, then an entirely confusing ending.
My two favorite characters are Rebecca (the lead) and the young fisherman (the zombie from the cover, he's alive for some part then gets killed).
If you can't do that, then you probably lost focus reading all of this due to lack of explosions and cgi, so it doesn't matter anyway.
If this film was set in 2004 then the ghosts would not be attacking!
Even in the library there was only Becky the librarian and the little girl but then you see someone playing with the doll house!
I understand that some stupid ass ghosts/zombies/ghouls or something like that come and mess people up every thirteenth year and then it is just a blur!
And even then they would suck!
Our lead actress's breasts get more screen time then the zombies at the end of the movie.
And then at the end of the movie we have Stan (love interest guy) saying that the little girl was the thirteenth victim, when the lead girl was supposed to be?
The then poor guy (Oh how things change) had to walk home after all.
Someone said that they reminded them of the '70's but then for me the whole film did.
And the "death sequence" got totally messed up--OK, the dead couple dragged the young couple off the beach, then the young couple took the car-crash couple??
Let's then say that we would be able to overlook ALL of this at ONCE, in an attempt to find other good things about this movie.
Seemed very robotic, monotone....."Bueller.....Bueller.....Bueller"  If the goal of this movie was to make you laugh...then in a way it's very successful....but I don't think it was the goal.
If this is a ploy to keep you watching in the hope that she will do it again, then it worked.
If you are a regular viewer of the bottom 100 (which you must be to look at a movie like this) then you would have seen 'US Seals' on the least, at its worst the number 1 bottom movie.
They just happen to stay at the same hotel as his wife (coincidence of course) and then the fun kicks in.
And then, faced with these 2 huge and obviuosly dangerous men, the man LETS THEM WALK THROUGH WITHOUT CHECKING FOR WEAPONS!!!
If your wife has been kidnapped, pick up the phone, make up a number, and then dial for instant success.
Anyway, there are too many flaws, but you will see them standing in the desert or something, and then one of them will say:  'hey, we better check out that old fort'  And off they go.
I'm confronted with an absolutely extraordinary story, but then, it stops before my eyes before ending!
The film reflects the anarchic dissonance and harsh violence of the newfangled "spaghetti" Westerns then pouring out of Europe, but ultimately its sensibility and construction belong to television.
As another reviewer said, in the old West, any idiot who tried to do what 'the bad man' did in this movie would find himself dead in side of five minutes, because back then, people stood up for and defended their family and property and town.
And sometimes the gunfighter will return, will Blue be able to defend his town then?
Only then does Blue fight him.
But then, my name isn't Doctorow.
The film opens with twenty minutes of pure imbecility: the "bad man"/drunkard kills, rapes, loots, and then burns the "town" down, and about a dozen inhabitants of this town don't do a thing to stop him.
I never lived in the Old West, but I cannot imagine that the people living in it would have sat around and just watched while one man was going around totally berserk; the early inhabitants of the frontier were tough people (unlike modern-day pansies) who would have had this "bad man" chopped up in little pieces, cooked, and then eaten.
He naturally then gets shot by the "bad man" and walks out of the saloon like a zombie and then drops to the floor - a very dumb scene indeed.
Without a doubt, it's this: If someone goes around killing your family and friends, and burns and steals all that you have fought hard for all your life, then don't get mad - and most importantly DON'T GET EVEN.
Just calm down, count to ten, wait for the misunderstood anti-social "bad man" (or men) to leave, and then rebuild your town and your existence.
And if this is the kind of film Britain is making then let the industry die.
If this film were transposed to a different world where a couple of young guys decided to become drag queens, walked down to Anytown, USA and then were ostracized - you think they would wander back to the desert and commit suicide???
I admit I was lost now and then.
But then again, some other people didn't act at all: Daniel Gelin (the doctor), Patric Bouchitey (the priest), ...  Mostly I don't say anything about the music, but this time it really beats everything.
The best part of the whole thing was when he thought up the genius idea that cartoons are brainwashing the youth of America and then showed a clip from the buzzlight year cartoon, of buzz getting an eye scan for ordering a pizza...absolutly hilarious!
For the years after, we have seen this on the two home mediums of VHS and DVD, and it was even great then!!!!!
Alex Jones have taken the few small things that could support your theory, and then you twisted them in a very political way, to fit your own theory People like Alex Jones are ruining the unwritten rules about documentaries should be neutral and non-political.
At first i believed it, but then i began to think, and realized, that it could not happen in a society like USA.
Now, ONJ, then hot off GREASE, has acting talent.
Then there's the whole 1940s - glam rock melding scene, when we actually hear Olivia's voice on the soundtrack during the 1940s scenes but then, whoa, Olivia is nowhere to be seen.
We then meet the kid and her mother and the man who wants to marry her.
I will concede that had more effort been given to fleshing out the story and had the producers picked a real editor and had a real score been made for the film rather than that awful 70s-like soundtrack used and had some more realistic special effects other than blue screens and the like been used - then, yes, this might have been somewhat decent.
In here she is shot, paralyzed, pushed into a gigantic fish tank, pulled and then dropped down stairs, and is choked with wire.
John Huston, whose performance consists of walking into rooms, spouting a few philosophically tinged lines of inane dialog and then vanishing, leads the cast as a "visitor" sent from someplace "beautiful" to "rescue" a little girl who is evil incarnate (and apparently the vessel-in-waiting to start a new race under the guidance of creepy doctor Mel Ferrer and a bunch of corporate goons).
No less than Jesus Christ is giving us insight (if you can call it that) in the situation, and then he sends out an elderly angel to Atlanta, because that's where the final earthly descendant of the evil sorcerer Zathaar lives.
An inherent flaw then, before we even begin.
Ooh, but then she overcomes it all in the end, with the help of her boyfriend...how surprising.
then one girls brother wants her to dance.
basically then the plot of break-dance takes over.
She starts of as being as adamantly against Myra getting parole as any other boor, and then...she changes her mind, and starts backing her husband.
And then I saw this execrable film, and it all became clear.
Guess who's going to wish they'd not broken their ASBOs...  Having introduced his raft of thoroughly selfish characters, and established them within a fairly creepy locale, Radclyffe then proceeds to belie his novice status as both a writer and director by boring the pants off his audience with a solid hour and a half of people wandering aimlessly through dark corridors, whilst the shadowy plague doctor randomly appears and disappears in the shadows.
Right in the middle of the tension-filled hall-stalk or door-open, the scene cuts and jumps to a map for a few moments and then back to the scene, where nothing happens.
At one point, one of the characters is supposedly infected with the plague, so they put him in a wire cage and then Anna suggests that they all go wash their hands.
And most telling of all, if you appreciate a filmmaker who shows you a clock stuck on 11:59 (p.m.) every ten minutes to remind you that nothing you're watching is REALLY happening, and has the audacity to think he can throw in 30 seconds of quick-cuts action just before closing credits to explain what ACTUALLY went on according to a script which must have had more scribbled afterthoughts than typed original entries, then SICK HOUSE probably is up your dark alley.
The last 10 minute set of commercials came on and then the wrap up: big plot hole here, but you'll have to watch it to find out.
There is just a bit of style and flair in the final showdown scene with the Super Computer where the villains are transformed into nightmarish robot slaves and then Superman is lashed repeatedly with huge energy bolts and pulled helplessly inside the guts of the computer - you actually get a sense of conflict and drama, and the clever way Supes saves the day by using his smarts and cunning almost saves the film.
If you want to watch a masterpiece then don't watch an adaptation of a child's book, that 20 years ago you would have loved.
I just watched Superman III and was excited to see Richard Pryor on the cover, but then I even thought as I was paying for the rental "wait, why am I excited to see Richard Pryor more than Christopher Reeve?
I Thank the heavens that a good 20 minutes of this movie was cut for theatrical release because it just made the pacing even worse!, most of the footage cut was more pointless forced comedy moments and the only high point of the footage being reinserted for the Extended TV Version shown numerous times in the late eighties were the newly created opening credits in space, rather then the credits appearing during the opening montage in the theatrical cut.
The movie does actually start to get good from the moment supes becomes "anti-supes", Watching the dual between Clark and Superman really lets you see how the whole movie could have been made "dark and serious" and kept out of the silly comedy path "even with Pryor and other factors etc" If Superman III had been made this way it probably would have been better then II!.
The Superman vs. Clark scene proves this, In Superman II where Zod and Superman battle it out, the end result is disappointing and nothing really happens other then Superman throwing Zod into a Coca-Cola sign, the confrontation in III is far far better!.
Why could the other 85 minutes of this movie not of been the same!, The rest of the movie deserves nothing more then a poor...  3/10
Asian horror seems to fall into two categories; you've got the boring ghost stories, with films such as Dark Water and The Grudge, and then you've got the ridiculous attempts at 'schlock' horror, with films like Versus and this rubbish.
If this is parody, then critics aren't lying when they classify it as the laziest genre.
If you want to learn what NOT to do when making a horror film, then watch "Stacy."
Besides the zombie thing, it's somewhat similar to a manga I read: by the end of 21th century, mysterious illness spreads out, teenage girls suddenly becoming more and more beautiful day by day, and so as weaker and weaker, then eventually die off.
A virus is killing young girls from 15 to seventeen, right before they die they go through a Near Death Happiness or NDH, if you will then die.
Satire is more then merely naming something after Georg Romero or having a chainsaw weapon after Bruce Campbell (shouldn't it be 'Ash's Righ Hand' anyway).
My Grade: D+   DVD Extras: Uncut version, other then that just a Theatrical Trailer
The filming is terrible, the special effects utterly suck (and I've seen my share of low-budget movies), there is no storyline - absolutely none - and even if there was then the utterly crap acting would make you instantly forget any storyline.
If total boredom won't make you run away screaming, then please take my advice and stay as far away from this movie as possible.
Just to clarify, I do not regularly make this statement and I am not one of those people who sees a bad movie and then calls it the worst they've ever seen.
at least i thought so.it's a magical fantasy adventure which for about 86 minutes should make you forget about you problems.and most kids should eat it up.there's certainly nothing objectionable here.while i was viewing it,it kept m,y attention and sort of brought me back to the days when i was a kid.this show wasn't around back then of course.all we had were Saturday morning cartoons.but if you try and view this with a child's perspective,you might appreciate it more.and if you do drift off,at least the young ones are watching something that won't pollute their minds.for entertainment aimed at children,you really can't go wrong with this movie.from that perspective,it's a 10/10
And then there is the confusing title.
when I got home and put it in i couldn't watch more then 5 minutes of it.
He's just another man in a monkey suit smashing cardboard sets and doing battle with a toy-tank army while clutching the pretty blonde heroine (Joanna Karns of "Growing Pains", then going by the name Joanna De Varona, and who can blame her for changing her name after this one).
In fact, if it had a first run presentation in the 1970's, I'm very surprised I missed it then.
Had the film followed from its original connotations it would have made sense, but then of course it would not be folly for analysis on its promotion of heteronormativity.
By then they were using first names.
This might be partly due to the fact that the movie was filmed with a particular vision in mind, and was then re-edited by somebody else.
Jabez then starts out again at the beginning of the movie...literally, we are just brought back to the first scene with Jabez, and then the movie abruptly ends.
It seems as though the movie had the scenes made individually, then cut them up and pasted them almost in random order.
All the snow they get there and then a movie like this blows into town too.
I am a fan of Bring it on but Bring it on again isn't what i have expected it to be.I thought the actors were better in Bring it on.The routines were not as good in bring it on again.When the movie was over I thought it basically just started and that they never had a very good ending.It was definitely not as good as the first movie.I thought they were going to go to the nationals but then the movie was over!Bring it on again would of been more enjoyable if they continued the movie until the nationals...like we don't even know how it ended!From now on I am never going to watch a cheer leading movie again but i will watch it if Kirstine Dunce comes back in a cheer leading movie!
And then came the sequel...I figured it would be a bit lame, a bit cheery and good for an hour and a half of killing time.
Chambers plays the best friend adequately,she was less annoying then Yager at least.
Then the build up to the big final showdown and then the ending where the underdog wins somehow.
The plot is pointless, the way some of the actors {Anne Judson-Yager} cheer is very annoying.I'd rather watch a blank screen for days then watch this movie for even five minutes.
But then again, who doesn't!
There was a lot of attempts at Copy-Catting the Original..We had the opening "Dream" and then there was a "Locker room scene" And there was a "Try Out" ... lastly a "competition" ... ugh...futile attempt.
and then there was just this incomplete story feel to it.
Things would have been hotter had Al caught Imogen in the sack with her lover, but then "Down To You" would have gotten pretty raunchy.
Judith detains Lincoln but they are both locked in a store room with a steel door while elsewhere Hesse crawls across a strange glowing spot on the floor badly injured & bleeding, as his blood drips onto the floor an evil demon is given the power to bring some of the various toys to life & Hesse first has his face chewed off by a mutant Jack in the Box, he then has his fingers bitten off by an incredibly vicious teddy bear & finally Hesse is shot by a toy robot using blue laser beams.
If your after a good, fun & entertaining killer toy film then check out the Puppet Master (1989 - 2003) & it's sequels, Dolls or the Child's Play (1988 - 2004) films instead.
Unbeknown to him Miller and his off sider (Milton Berle) copy them down and then pass them off as Miller originals.
Sure, more of the story events take place in this film then Kubrick's, but it translated the scenes completely inaccurate as to how they were described in the book.
The Humbert character in the book was a lot closer to Clare Quilty then the 1997 movie makes it seem.
First we see a young boy, but then we get to see his "real appearance": Some plastic dummy with the voice of that same boy!
Since then, Seagal hasn't made one good film.
Anyone watch the thug in the market slip on a tomato, fall and then ACCIDENTALLY slide headfirst into a knife?????
After the awful Foreigner & Out for a Kill I had this movie written-off before I'd watched it, thankfully it turned out to be much better then recent efforts.
The only thing I hated was the movie was more about homophobia and gay bashing.Not that I support Nazi skinheads but I don't understand why they were so threatened by gays instead of the groups of black and Asian gangs in the neighborhood.There was an interesting remark made in the DVD extra features that mentions that there is more violence within their own ranks then there is violence towards others.I loved the scene in the movie when a huge group of gay men got together and bashed the skinheads back.I have never seen that before in a movie and they deserved the beating.It was nice to see a bit of payback from the gay community.Ironically the most vicious gay hating skinhead David Lee played by David Lee Willson has come out as a gay man in real life.I read a really cool article about this actor and how hard it was for him to play such an evil hateful role.
The shocking rape scene was really well done but I didn't like how she treated her boyfriend afterwords since he was helpless to save her.And then to kill herself afterwards was cowardly and not believable.Yes it was traumatic but I have never heard of rape victims taking their own life because of it.What the skinheads did was rotten,but then so was what the group of black men did to her and her boyfriend.And then later the same group of blacks targeted the white girls.I am sure it probably happens a lot also,but they don't seem to be depicted as bad guys which is a total double standard.At that point I was waiting for the skinhead group to get even with them for shooting an innocent kid who was only lured into it because he was mentally challenged.And they were also protecting their female members from being nearly assaulted which any gang would do no matter who they are.
)acts poorly also,usually having a rant then remembering he should be angry so suddenly starting screaming...I could go on and on about how pants this film is but ill summarise:  -Cardboard characters -Very disappointing storyline dealt with by earlier movies (eg: The Crow) -Diabolical Dialogue -Very amateur looking  Id recommended Romper Stomper if you want a skinhead bashing-fest or American History X,which is thousands of years ahead of this film,despite being made earlier.
If you put it next to a highly-produced Hollywood film like A.H.X, then sure this one will look sick in comparison.
But when looked at in the "trash film" context, then this one becomes at least entertaining.
I was quite shocked to then discover that it had been made a recently as 1998, after both American History X (AHX) and Romper Stomper.
If you want to see the same plot idea handled in an incredibly powerful, subtle and truly masterful way then read the comic (not the film).
If it's on television and you have nothing better to do then watch it, it'll pass the time, it's not *that* bad.
But if you enjoy the violent neo-Nazi romanticising movie then watch Romper Stomper as it's better.
If you enjoy the revenge theme then read (or, to a lesser extent, watch) The Crow.
If you want to wonder through streets following strangers then this is the movie for you!
However, Marina and Lola don't get on and are forever trading insults and then tragedy strikes when local girl Heather Babcock (MAUREEN BENNETT) dies after drinking a cocktail laced with poison.
We rented the DVD and then he saved his own money to buy it.
The whole premise of her accepting the job in the first place is that she can then move on to enviable roles in other magazines.
But then again, if just one or two of the people who were killed in Port Arthur had a firearm themselves and knew how to use it properly, the death toll from that incident would have been drastically reduced.
Watch this movie and take pride in the fact that you and your friends could make a better movie in less then twenty minutes.
"Galaxy of Terror" is a movie that I saw for the first time almost 20 years ago and my reaction to this movie back then was "OH THIS MOVIE IS DISGUSTING!!!"
Unless you want to watch some truly sickening moments, then tune in.
If they wanted proof to back up this argument then 'There They Go-Go-Go' would be the ideal candidate.
Donald then offers to play the kids again, this time blindfolded.
Plus, the side episodes were either all about: Cyborg realizing he's human for the 300th time; Robin and Starfire drama; Beast Boy messing everything up, then saving the day; or Raven (who had the least side episodes out of all the characters) not really doing much.
If there ever is another sequel, which I doubt it, then it needs to forget this one ever happened and be handled either by Lommel himself or someone who has at least some idea of how to make a decent horror film.
If you're looking for some low budget gore and a combination of zombies and vampires, then this is for you.
When I read posts saying they thought this film wasn't very good but then they found out how low the budget was and now have new respect for the film...I cringe.
Like in many documentaries, they will tease you with the beginning of a wonderful song, then speak over it, or cut away.
If you want to see a comedy without any laugher, then this movie is the best choice you can take.
If obvious little puns and predictable little jokes are comedy, then I am way out of it.
The 126 minutes' length hints of a genre-piece that can't stop itself: the director wrote twice as many fainting scenes, dream sequences, and face-offs between heroine-villain as any film could sustain, and then left in every damned one of them.
This ridiculous charade repeats itself several times and in each one there is never any suspense because you KNOW that Banderas and co. will calmly allow the villains to empty their arsenal and then our boys can go on a slickly filmed, stylish killing spree of the bad boys.
Compare this to the meaningless gore in "Desperado", when characters are introduced and then killed off without the slightest reason.
It is then killed without any real reason and without any emotional effect on the audience, maybe because it is not really possible to withstand such an idiotic and unrealistic character for more than a few minutes.
And then came all the Hollywood money and ruined him.
If you are going to make it ridiculous, then let it be funny.
& is then forgotten about, lots of spiritual nonsense spouted by Corbeck which amounts to nothing, chopped up Mummy's buried in Abel's garden (!
To be honest if you want to watch a decent Mummy flick then go for the big budget The Mummy (1999) or it's sequel The Mummy Returns (2001) which are far superior to this in every way.
and I decide to fast forward through it and then the climax and the movie was over!
Go lie on a bench and move your body first 10Â° to the left and then 20Â° to the right.
One has to admire those academics, if not for their vocabulary, then for the fact that he doesn't start laughing when the giant and fierce (and frankly slow) robot appears.
It's almost as if someone came up with this bizarre outline for a story & decided to turn it into a 20 minute TV program without any regard for the poor audience who has to sit through it, the story is just weird & if you like strange stories which make no sense & don't work on any sort of narrative level then Ring Aroiund the Redhead may be the TV program you've been waiting for your whole life.
If, however, like me you like your stories to have a purpose & actually tell an entertaining tale then Ring Around the Redhead isn't for you at all.
So, I suggest you watch the first half then catch the last 10 minutes if you are interested.
A man goes around entering homes of women, strips their clothes, rapes, and then kills them.
The film's single genuinely erotic encounter, a tiny puddle of style and sensuality in a quagmire of crap, it showcases the talents of cinematographer C. Davis Smith, who until then seemed thwarted by Wishman's ham-fisted approach, bringing to mind that he also photographed Â extremely well, I might add Â such adult classics like Howard Winters' practically perfect NEON NIGHTS and COED TEASERS, one of the frequently despised Lenny "Leon Gucci" Kirtman's finer films.
I struggled through the first 30-40 minutes, and then could not bring myself to watching it to the end, so whatever I say here is based only on the first part.
Bad acting from one person only doesn't necessary make a movie a total disaster, but when just EVERYTHING ELSE also are as horrible as they can be, then we have a movie that never should've been made.
Here, I'll mention a few things that I especially noticed as bad:   - In the fight at the wharf, you clearly see that the people who get pushed into the water stops at the edge, and then jumps into the water themselves.
Being on an epic movie kick lately, I decided to check out again this "lost" debut of Arnold Schwarzenegger's where not only is his then unpronounceable surname changed to the unimaginative Strong (in the manner of the stars of Italian peplums) but his voice was also dubbed by an American actor for U.S. theatrical release (which is unsurprising as his original vocal track - which is how I watched the movie myself - is virtually unintelligible at times)!
this, is NOT one of those films it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe I have ever scene, the camera work is trying to be flashy but it really just crap the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries, but without the sex, the only reason I bought this was I wanted to try out dvd and this was the cheapest one I could find, possibly the worst buy of my life and could have put you off dvd forever, the soundtrack is REALLY tacky and most of the movie is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films, why anyone would want to make a movie as awful as this is beyond me, if they had really attempted to make an original movie and failed I would be nicer in this review but they don't they just got the rights to reproduce stuff from the first two and then edit it and repeat it into this film with about maybe under 1 3rd original footage which is about up to the standards of film school students, DO NOT buy this movie.
But then again I have a feeling many people involved in this movie weren't quite sure of what they were doing.
I came away more obsessed with the hot bods,like Wahl,Modean,one day up-and-coming starlet Nikki(then Bobbi)Fritz and Rhonda Flynn,than I was with most of the people in this flick.
Oh sure, we could have watched such gems as "Highway To Heaven" or "Riptide" on broadcast TV instead, but then what the hell were our parents paying $6.50 a month on cable for?
It's wretched and all known copies of it should be doused in concentrated acid and then farted on.
If you like drumming or whatever, then go see it.
so allow me to just sum up this movie for u then: (spoiler, but please be spoiled)  -Guy goes to a mountain shed in the snow to undergo an experiment with a doctor, guy gets killed, guy gets revived but now his eyes look exactly like those of master Poo in Kung Fu, guy gets killed another 9 times, gets revived 9 more times and then he walks back down the mountain.
One wonders how it's possible to expend the time, money, and effort required to create a film, and to then turn an apparently blind eye to the final product.
If your expectations are so low that nudity in a non-adult film is sufficient to get you to watch a movie, particularly given how easy it is to find nudity and near nudity on line without going to an adult site, then this is probably the movie for you.
If you expect good technical production values, an excellent and plausible story, good direction and acting, then you want to avoid this film.
If this is what passes for children's entertainment in China, then that is one messed up country.
After the hatching, Dickey then dreams that the friendly, magical alien (who he thinks is a toy with batteries) will create additional magical electronic devices to make him smarter, stronger, better, etc...at school.
and then also has exploding diarrhea's out of fear (is this suppose to be funny as well?).
Dickey abuses the dog, throws it away in a trash can at school, and then has regrets.
But then it's pretty obvious that the budget didn't really stretch to much in the way of even the cheapest special effects, with those there are largely of the stopping-the-camera-and-starting-it-again after-the-actors-have-left-the-frame variety, alongside a magic neon hula-hoop left over from some disco movie, a pair of Spock ears from a novelty shop and, in one memorable killing, silly string (or as the DVD chapter stop calls it 'The silly string of death').
Naturally for a naff movie this boasts a good UK DVD, with a superb transfer (but then it's not as if the negative got much use) and an array of more on-set interviews than any sane individual could ever want to watch, including one great moment where Marcel is asked if it's true he turned down a $10m budget because he didn't want to cast big names: "That's a load of rubbish" he replies while trying not to burst out laughing
If you like Bette Davis, then you might want to see this film if for no other reason than to get a glimpse of what low grade junk assignments she had to put up with early in her career.
One moment Tammi pulls a knife on the guys but then is disarmed.
Four young men and three young women, party, have sex, and then become embroiled in a deathfest when one of the girls dies during a sex act.The acting is fairly good, the characters are fine and the girls, Sian Breckin,Nichola Burley and Jaime Winston (daughter of Ray) look good and are a teenage boys dream, well "up for it".
There, it feels like an hour of pointless prattle, then a hot scene of group sex, Donkey Punch resulting in an accidental neck-snap, followed up by the whole "lets ditch the body and get out of here" routine...
Then someone dies by having a flare fired into his chest, then it ignites him on fire?
The survivors then start fighting amongst themselves, and the film descends into a spiral of violence, with several more people being killed in a variety of unpleasant ways.
As an aside, if the people portrayed in this film are an accurate representation of young Britons abroad, then I'm glad I don't bother with run of the mill holiday resorts with the binge drinking and all that goes with it.
When Babe shoots her husband, then goes into the kitchen to make a pitcher of lemonade, and offers him a glass...well, it's not something I find hilarious or entertaining to watch.
This movie sucks so much I can't believe I'm using more then 3 paragraphs to let you know how much it sucks.
There are fight movies - and then there are movies that fight back...
wow that alone makes this story sad, then to make it better she goes dressed as a hooker and well what do you know she ends up being to poor to afford dinner for her kids and gets them a cola, wow.
The actual events started off being subtle, but then we are quickly thrown head first into an array of crazy events that feel like they were there to cover up the many plot holes and show off ILM's command of the effects.
The first one was bad, so I unsubscribed, and then the other two just sat there for a month.
According to the Bollywood Bible, God created man, and then he recreated a better version and then another and another till he perfected man.
And then, since God was not the only perfect entity (man joining him in that elite club) anymore, they both got together and created woman.
But then Sippy Sr. had Salim-Javed as writers.
Why did he do this then?
Throughout the movie I was waiting for something to grip me and hold me to my seat, but then there was nothing.
The editing by Augie Hess, is just downright awful in scenes, most evident in a scene where Jones is being chased by the Yemenians and then ends up in a bathroom somewhere.
Lawyer and hero have a Wayne/McGaglan-style fight after the lawyer realises how indefensible his client truly is, and then having rolled around smashing each other up and the studio set, bond together in macho male laughter.
The Yemenis then supposedly came in and removed every weapon, every spent cartridge, and - and this is REALLY ridiculous - every bullet and bullet-hole (the defence lawyer is told that all the shots came from snipers with rifles, and photographs a few bullet holes, but finds nothing to contradict this, throwing grave doubt on the colonel's judgement that the crowd was more dangerous than the snipers).
The court-martial then decides to believe that a videotape that they haven't seen, the existence of which can not be proven, vindicates their officer.
The NSA and the ambassador are then blamed (okay, that's believeable if there was a change of government in between.
If this movie is what extreme skiers do, then I'll stick to my day job.
Copy something and then add a few disguising touches.
The stutter was endearing at first, then pitiful, then it just got annoying near the end of the movie when it finally dawns on the audience that Nicholas D'Agosto's character doesn't actually help him conquer it.
The direction in the two important fights, first with the fabulous African-American actor and former pugilist, CANADA LEE and then the final fight, were so well wrought, filmed and edited that it utterly destroys any movie made before or after which dealt with boxing.
We are treated to footage of people's arms stretched out across two concrete blocks and then being broken with axe handles; we see fingers hacked off, then the screaming, bleeding victim tossed aside to fend for himself; we see hands amputated surgically and tongues clipped outÂall these horrific atrocities committed by way of punishment in the name of "justice".
People are talking, and then all of the sudden it cuts, and cuts, and cuts in the middle of their dialogue, like someone keeps accidentally hitting the fast-forward button.
But then the sound mixing is sometimes equally awkward, leaving you with the impression that the film was rushed into completion in the hopes of scoring some Oscar nominations that they didn't quite manage to finish any it.
I think rescuing the heroine from her giant gilded birdcage, wrapping her in feathers and then running with her flying like a kite on a string probably takes the WTF?
Girl meets guy, meet the parents, there's trouble, a bad patch, the struggle, the heroism and then a happy ending, oh and not to forget the dancing and singing.
At least the medic attempts to help , but why does the pilot then retract his offer of assistance?
He then decides it was all a mistake and disappears into oblivion.
The film was started post HAHK(even the title was HUM AAPKE HAI SANAM that time) and it took 8 years to complete  When the promo was shown i was shocked considering SRK and Salman haven't shared screenspace since KARAN ARJUN and suddenly a film with them and Madz comes   The movie is regressive, outdated and could be better in 90's  The back story of Madz- Salman is so cringeworthy even there is too much sermonising  But there is one plus point and that is SRK in this film, well normally he overdoes his scenes here he is in full control and plays his role with a straight face and brings a lot of fun in the movie  Sadly the film never manages to sustain the tempo and we have tripe like GALE MEIN LAAL TIE.etc  Also it's funny to see the appearances of actors Salman suddenly in 1 scene looks straight out of JUDWAA days with his medium sized hair and with his overacting but lively acting and then he comes to 2001 days where he looks dead The dubbing too is inconsistent and also his acting which goes from amateurish and then to dead acting SRK too suddenly has short hair, long hair and also his looks keep changing and so his dubbing and acting Madz too, in 1 scene she has brown hair and then the ponytailed black hair look  The film also has the late Laxmikant Berde who wasn't much seen in 2002 Also we see Atul Agnihotri who was rejected post 1998 i feel and was just seen as an extra   Direction by KS Abdiyamaan is outdated though good in parts Music is okay, most songs sound old Cinematography is inconsistent  Acting SRK though looks inconsistent yet he delivers a wonderful performance and rarely hams which is a relief Madz is as usual, she does a good job but her role is too regressive Salman khan is inconsistent, at times lively and at times dead below average overall Laxmikant Berde is okay Alok Nath is okay in a small role Atul Agnihotri is a reject and he annoys
It's then that a fight breaks out between the teenagers and Dr. Myra and her two hoods Worf & Brandt as well as Ivan with the monkey/gorilla, one of Dr. Myra's failed experiments, breaking out of the cage killing Brandt as everyone runs for their lives to the boat by the beach to escape.
If you are a fan of bad films, then it's well worth seeing.
And then there's the ludicrously bad acting, the often inappropriate music, the strange silent pauses at every turn, and the poor sets.
They might have considered letting nature take its course (but, then, there wouldn't be a movie).
With his mother Anna, Anne Revere, being against him boxing Charlie tries to find a new line of employment Later when Charlie's father David, Art Smith, is killed in a bombing of his candy store by some mobsters, who mistook it for a rival speakeasy, and then with no money to pay the bills Charlie decides that boxing is the only way for him and his family to get out of poverty.
Putting Ben on his payroll as his trainer, because he feels that he owes Ben something after what he did to him, Charlie defends his title a number of times but now he's up against a much younger and more formidable opponent then those he fought, Marlow.
The characters deliver lines and then wait a second or two.
He is going to search the USA state by state starting with California, working up the West coast and then moving east state by state.
The boys start to build a raft then sneak back to their cell.
I have never forgotten the scene when Mary Currier(The welfare worker) comes to the house to interview Ann Revere and Garfield throws her out, and Garfield and Revere have words and she tells him better you should buy a gun then become a fighter and he says to her,"You need money to buy a gun."
But I don't think Clyde Beatty and Siegfried Sassoon together could train 100 rats to pretend to drown, then play dead while floating underwater, a trick employed here with great verisimilitude.
*** Possible Spoilers Ahead ***  First of all, a group of people play roleplaying games (I didn't realize that people who are in their 30's played roleplaying games, but I guess they are trying to act like teenagers for the film), then one of the losers kills themselves because they are in love with one of the other losers (ooh, very dramatic).
With this in mind, I knew more or less what to expect here â but, then, there were other factors involved which rendered it even less appetizing than his other works!
The film, then, ends abruptly with the unannounced arrival on the scene of the military forces.
I know my wife wouldn't so easily accept another woman, and then let her sleep in my bed too!
If only the same level of attention had been given to the script as to the aforementioned robot's knickers and bra, then maybe it would have been less pointless.
She has maybe two scenes and then she runs off (Literally).
To complete their task they have two and a half day, then a 100-feet tall giant human-eating monster will be sent after them.
If you wish to torture your friends or family for awhile, then put this film on the big screen and watch everyone squirm in their seats with boredom.
Actors hit marks and then don't move from them through the rest of scenes, and lines are delivered as if read from cue cards.
It wears think after a fairly short and then gets downright annoying.
How in the world can you make up such a story and then collect North-Americas worst actors and make a film out of it????
then in the first action scene they all act like they're meeting each other for the first time.
The movie is about some kids whose parents died, and then they are trained to be elite soldiers.
Like in the beginning, when the bad guys escape, but then suddenly a truck crashes into them.
Or when the Elite see the car of the bad guys, lying on a train railway, and say "They might still be alive", but then a train arrives and drives over the car, just classic.
Ostensibly, it should be hard to understand why certain movies slip into obscurity despite being loaded with talent, but then you come across a case like this one and the possibility suddenly becomes not just plausible but inevitable.
If I'm to believe Lombard's character is this easily pestered into a relationship then I have to wonder why Bellamy's annoying character hasn't already pestered her into marriage.
Predictably, then, this movie takes huge liberties with historical fact and Phillipa Gregory's historical fiction, and that is not a good thing.
The BBC made a TV series of this in 2003 and then decided to flog that horse again, so this was the result, an inferior feature film, very badly directed indeed by Justin Chadwick.
He had Cardinal Wolsey separate them and then Percy was married off to Mary Talbot.
Mary's son was just surnamed Carey because Henry had got involved with Anne by then and so no royal bastard surname for him, but he was made Lord Hunsford.
Anne's daughter, spent her childhood with Anne of Cleves and then went to love with Cath.
She would never have broken the incest taboo; also, if Henry was really shunning her bed by that time, as Anne suggests in the film, then if she turned up pregnant she would be accused of adultery and sent to the Tower!
Of course, it could not then claim to be based on Gregory's book about Mary Boleyn.
Only then did the sisters join the English court, much less begin their dramas with the king.
But once Henry had set his eyes upon her and chose to make her his own, then and only then were her uncle and father's schemes put into motion.
No Tudor movie since then has gotten close in accuracy or sheer entertainment since then.
If that`s the case then why does the opening caption read " Somewhere in France , All saints day , 1944 " Couldn`t the caption have given the exact location ?
Since reading about the truth in " true stories " like PAPILLON and SLEEPERS alarm bells always ring in my head when the words " true " and " story " appear side by side , and if the story is in fact true ask yourself this question : If the events on screen actually happened then why isn`t the case better known .
Of course as soon as the waffen SS turned up and got some bayonet practice in I realised this wasn`t going to be the case , but by then the damage had been done and I knew not to expect any intentional laughs  POSSESSED isn`t of much interest except for one aspect - How things used to be .
Movies that give you a great plot, great scenes, well written, and then just end leaving it all open to interpretation, while it is loved by the masses i hate it.
The writer/director glommed onto the title, Never Again, then decided what a great movie title that would be and wrote (I use the word loosely) a movie around the title, using obvious setups.
The film then relates this relationship - but to say any more would give away the plot.
This is an interesting notion for what promises to be a stirring tale of adventure, but then the plot shifts to Bangkok, where are found the two daughters of Alex, Leslie (Nancy Kwan) and Georgia (Jennifer Rhodes with the work's best performance), along with the latter's child, all about to embark upon a journey to pay their father a surprise call.
The creature must be stopped lest it ruin the local tourism business, and Dr. Loomis gets really intense, sits around glowering like a madman while knocking back the native booze & gabbering about the past, and finally lures the panther to go mano-a-mano with his wits, slamming the doors at the last second ... and then skarkers.
Bad move ... then again Cleopatra didn't have red hair ... so maybe Fleming shouldn't have made this movie at all.
Don't expect any resemblance to facts other than on the barest surface and even then it's a stretch.
As for William Lundigan, well he switched allegiances effortlessly, from Caesar to Brutus to Anthony to Cleopatra back to Anthony to Octavius and then I lost track.
That was then, this is now.
Top Gun is a quaint nostalgic look in history, the way we were, then.
As much as Kate Hepburn's quivering chin and teary eyes are an annoyance to devotees of serious acting in film, Connie Selleca's wooden gestures and her inability to deliver a line with any meaningful emotion are enough to invoke the "throw-up" doctrine for evaluating films: If an actor's inability to act creates such nausea that vomiting in unavoidable, then the film itself should be consigned to the nearest trash-bin.
Attitudes about marijuana are not nearly as close minded as they were back then.
And then he really pushes his luck with the hot lady teacher on a blanket by the ocean by literally forcing her to go on a date with him where he makes his moves way too fast.
What he wouldn't have given for another film with Jimmy Stewart right about then.
Then, there is something called the âCigarette Shastraâ that the subject is supposed to read, and then sign a contract!
But then the script takes over again and forces them to play a series of unlikely scenes.
Cosby and he have some chemistry and there is an okay set up for a movie then just no movie.
I think I would rather watch Orca for 72 hours then watch this again.
A well editted glimpse, with all the explosoions, and feminine body outlines necesary to look like another good kill people and then have sex movie (knock 'em all you like people dig james bond syndrome).
A comedy should make you laugh this fails miserably,i didnt laugh once.yet it has a great supporting cast,but the script wastes the talent involved.yet another British flop.a movie then about morons and only morons will enjoy this tedious turkey.1 out of 10
After the first 10 minutes I was like "well OK they just need to get some action started and then the movie will be worth watching" and then after 15 the first action scene came, and what a load of crap that was.
When you consider that this constitutes the marrow of the film, it is quite easy then to understand how awful the movie is.
Why lead us on in to thinking we are watching a spy spoof and then deliver us a weak, campy movie (it doesn't even do campy well) about some teen romance?
lol But I suppose if you're a big fan of Aniston or McConaghy, yeah I don't know how to spell his damn name, lol, then go ahead and see this.
If you want a movie you can watch and step away from every now and then while doing your chores or other errands, this is the one to do it with.
"Never Again" tells of a single middle aged man (Tambor) and woman (Clayburgh) who find each other, have good sex, and then begin to wrestle with issues as they search warily for deeper meaning.
There is no chemistry between any of the actors, the writing is on middle-school level, and any movie that dares to invoke Katharine Hepburn in one scene and then drags its characters through one contrived and pointless and flatly-acted episode after another is indeed crud.
A lizard bites Matthew and then chuckles like a Budweiser chameleon.
This movie is just a mind-freeze - watch point A move to Point B and then to Point C - now go home.
In particular I think of the scene between the 2 actors who have an affair on the side and the camera pans out for a few seconds then we cut.
The pregnant actor's wife who held everyone hostage and then everything's hunky dory?
Could have been funny but then it becomes very dark and again the tone is awkward.
That's why there porn stars, if a women as beautiful as Jenna could act, then she would have tried to go into mainstream movies instead of porn.
I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 rating just because Jenna is so hot, but there are better movies she has made then "Dream Quest".
The audio commentary was useless since it's a skin flick but even then that was bad too.
And then she just died for no apparent reason.
And then I never really got the point of the sister/boyfriend subplot.
They moved to Sicily and ... since then the movie can be summarized in four words: Sicily = hell Finland = paradise  Sicily is not the perfect world and Finland is an indeed very nice country.
That said, with say a better actor, such as Clint Eastwood in the role, instead or Arnie, then maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10 for this movie.
Also part way through there is a 10 minute scene where on his way to somewhere arnie pops into a casino to do a bit of gambling, it becomes apparent the craps table is rigged (including the line "magic or MAGNETS") he then immediately proceeds to smash up the casino, and for good measure, drive a truck through it.
He then carries on going about his business.
Who should see this film:  -- Serious action buffs only, and then only on a rainy day,  and then only if you've gotten through Conan & Predator,  and then only if you're getting it free on TV.
Music and environment are very similar, but then "Lady Snowblood" have something that "Kill Bill" doesÂ´nt.
Meiko Kaji, who plays the revenging women is about 300 times better actress then "Uma-i-should-be-a-waitress-Thurman".
What is exactly interesting or artful in watching a comatose girl being raped, and then seeing her bite the tongue out of her rapist's mouth?
Then we get the oh so original 'black and white' moment where an entire fight scene, one which contained so many fountains of blood they should have been swimming at the end, suddenly losses colour then for no apparent reason comes back?
If Tarantino is a genius, then I was a genius at age twelve.
We then get to see a man's body get shattered into a million pieces by Harvey Keitel.
Keitel then builds a robot that is able to relate his thoughts.
The captain then takes the dead man's place on a mission to deliver a robot to an experimental food laboratory on Saturn manned by Adam (Kirk Douglas of "The War Wagon") and Alexis (Farrah Fawcett of "Charlie's Angels").
Veteran director Stanley Donen, with help from Barry, generates atmosphere and suspense, but "Saturn 3" drags along in places, suddenly accelerates, and then stalls out.
They then stuck Hector's own "head" atop it.
Also none of the actors seemed to be working together, it was almost as if each person was shot separately reading their insipid lines, and then with the magic of 1980s Parent Trap technology, spliced together for the finished product.
And the head is just one of those robot arms with two christmas lights for eyes...why sculpt the abs and then give it no head?
then this is the perfect film.
If you plan of having a "Bad Sci-Fi Movie Festival," then this would be the film to have for it.
How to make SATURN 3: mix a little ALIEN, a little SILENT RUNNING, a little DEMON SEED and then burn it in the oven.
However, if that is all that can be wrong with a film, then it is near perfection in my book.
In the end, one has to wonder what Stanley Donen was thinking when he accepted such a project - but, then, his career had always been somewhat erratic (including at least a couple more notorious false steps with the homosexual two-hander STAIRCASE [1969] and the bootlegging comedy LUCKY LADY [1975]).
If Saturn 3 is a story of jealousy and desire, then it needs more than a sex-starved droid to generate credibility.
If it is a sci-fi actioner, then it needs more action.
If it was conceived as a sci-fi thriller then it most assuredly needs more thrills.
If you know nothing about the subject yet want to feel that you are flying with the aircraft then by all means go an see this film.
If you know something about the subject matter then you will pick holes all over the place in this film.
My view is that if they are too politically sensitive to talk about then don't even show us the images either!
We then move to the flying sequences.
I know much of this may seem like nit-picking but the film started out with so much promise, and then it goes on to suffer from "dumbing-down", which is a great shame as several bits are very good, especially one where a camera is slung underneath an F-15 and we get treated to some great low-level flying; and the shot of four F-15Es in close formation at a fairly low-level.
The first 10 minutes seemed to be OK but then everything fell apart.
The filmmakers then shift to a series of interviews about the mysterious virus and we learn that nobody knows if the virus is airborne, waterborne, or in contaminated food.
Obviously, if you are not a fan of zombie movies, then you should not watch this film.
The film then goes from group to group, concluding each story and eventually links them all together in admittedly quite a clever way.
The marketing for this film was copied from Blair Witch Project : Make a cheap badly directed badly acted film and then get a few spin doctors to go on the net to start word of mouth.
The movie starts well, then gets worse, and worse, and worse.
Although once they entered a secluded house that's when tension/suspense started to come in but then it just died a couple minutes later.
Right then I knew this was gonna be a puke of a movie.
If they are your inspiration and influence then you might as well leave film-making to those who do not make the cameraman stand on a large rubber ball when shooting scenes.
less dull) later, but then that awfully stupid ending ruins whatever minimal chances this movie had of being even semi-passable.
If zombies stand there doing nothing while simultaneous scaring the crap out of everybody, then yes, it's very, very realistic.
The way directors Michael Bartlett and Kevin Gates arrange the stories rather bugged me, truth be told, because they had opened the film with a young news crew heading outside London into the country to film an interview piece, and then completely abandon them.
I think if the filmmakers had stuck with the crew as they come in contact with their hostile forces, both human and undead, then this could've been quite a success.
Just goes to show that clunkers were indeed made back then as well.
The final chapter tries to make a statement about us being the real monsters, not the zombies Â by then I'd grown so bored that I applauded the deaths of the remaining survivors and cursed the gods that this moment had not arrived sooner.
I just bought the DVD for 10 cents, so, I am not worried about my money, but I am upset for the time that I took to choose and then to watch it.
As is, the film seems to be little more than a bunch of friends having a party, getting properly intoxicated and then breaking out the home video camera.
I knew the film was going to be a little wierd, but then, I like weird.
The message is that Soderbergh is the artiste, and if the film doesn't satisfy, then tough.
It starts beautifully, in a studio-designed rustic setting (and the best set in the film); and then a rainstorm soaks a vacationing fisherman, who proceeds to go into the local town and ask for help in getting treatment for a head injury he sustained when he fell against a rock.
Then you hear that second gunshot, then another, and another...And another....And yet another.
In fact, the "Ancient Warriors" is a 7 second scene of six Sardinian young men wearing garb with spears in hand, they step out from the wall from which they were previously superimposed, rocks falls killing Richard Lynch's character, then then back step into the cave wall again & disappear... Don't believe me?
Richard Lynch's character is 80% coughing up phlegm & blood from some un-named disease, and then the other 20% wishing he was in a Chuck Norris flick..
So if it's no big deal then what's the point of this story?
Originally, I had a cherished, recorded-from-the-TV version in 3 parts, and then a few years ago I bought a second-hand copy of the VHS.
One with these unfamiliar scenes added in bonus features.. or if this IS the original, then please put back the removed scenes as bonus features!
And then, fifteen minutes in, the movie switches gears completely.
So then he decides not to show for the wedding.
But then he decides to show up.
I did this for my two girls, then 5 and 7, they absolutely loved this movie.
You will then be decently impressed or just neutral about the film.
If the yeti had stayed more or less in the shadows, and if they limited the stupid roaring, then I'd have rated it at least a 7.
But then again, please don't have any high expectations before watching the flick.
However, if you are a crypto movie fan, then you might just enjoy this anyway.
You laugh the first time and then it is an exercise in cringing as you realise you are supposed to be frightened of this thing.
Each episode is nearly identical: some bad thing kidnaps the chick, then Ken-doll caveman turns into Mightor, while his kid brother (son?
If you like watching people eating each other basically, then you'll have a blast!
It comes ashore, invisible, then materializes and kills some people.
It then returns to the sea.
The She Creature her, or it, self takes care of business by finally putting an end to Dr. Lombardi's obsession with both it and Andrea, whom it supposed to have been way back then in prerecorded history.
From then on, the acting goes steadily downhill.
American-International and Roger Corman would soon wise up and turn these productions over to eager young unknowns and then the real campy fun would start.
Apparently a stupid sideshow hypnotist named Dr. Carlo Lombardi(if this guy is a real doctor, then I'm a Nobel prize winning physicist) keeps a pretty woman under hypnosis(this guy is the early version of Rohypnol, the date rape drug) for no other reason except that he can, and she won't touch him when she's awake.
For a while, I had (blessedly) forgotten this movie, and then for some reason, I was reminded of it.
And then I remembered that I couldn't stand this movie.
Well, it starts off fast, with death and lots of color, but then it goes blah.
If you guys really want to stir the pot, and make us dumb viewers think...then do it better.
I saw the Yes men recently, a documentary about guys who essentially pretend to be from the World Trade Organisation and then pull funny stunts in order to prove that the World Trade Organisation is an evil empire.
Now here is the Catch-22: if the audience were taken in, then they do not know anything about the WTO; if they were not taken in, then the Yes Men made fools of themselves.
If you just want to see some funny pranks, then see "Amici Miei" (1975): too cynical for some people, but at least there is something to laugh about, and even the toilet humor manages to be funny.
Though her acting has improved from the previous films (due to large part of her being voiced over) she still looks like she has nothing better to do then pace around in a scene to waste film and expand the films running time.
Whatever lost clever moments that might have had a chance from Nemesis 2 and 3 are replaced with quickly filmed garbage, with a script that from what I can tell was written on a cocktail napkin, vomited on and then given to the actors to read as the scene was being filmed.
Nine Queens was a great Argentinian film, and then there were, of course, remakes of this first movie because of it big success.
If you have already seen 9 Queens then this won't hold any surprises for you.
are all fine but then again, it was all fine (if not excellent) in 9 Queens.
If you haven't seen 9 Queens then watch that instead because it is better.
Writing a review of it seems to be a waste of time but I've already wasted 90 minutes of my life watching it so if I can stop other people from doing the same then it was worth it.
It may be worth a watch for Horror fanatics(like myself), but even then I would have trouble recommending it, and it's badly made and written as well, plus Gary Lockwood played his role extremely well as the prick of a Mayor!.
Now if a director decides to hire cameramen who all seem to have one thing in common - epileptic seizures whenever there's action - then that director is condemned to a certain hell (quoting a known shepherd).
Watching the 'being thrown out of the helicopter' scene and "seeing" Stone Cold land hard on the sand you then know most of his hard stuff is going to be done by stunt-men.
Vinnie Jones rapes the Hispanic women who was there with her husband (although you see nothing, it's all implied) and then blows her up so she's #4 dead.
Now then.
Or the black guy (characer names are hardly worth remembering) who says he will never trust another woman and then realizes the female contestant just pulled his suicide pin while she runs away.
If you like WWF, then you will probably be satisfied.
If you want to hang round with a group of drunk, middle aged, social retards; then I suggest you watch this film and find your nearest brass band recruitment officer and jump on board the road to hell (aka the continuously fruitless pursuit of winning any competition which comes even mildly close to worthwhile).
Another reviewer put it best with the title for his review: "made for TV" One of the problems with made-for-TV movies is that some producer or network executive comes up with a concept and then hires by commission the writer and director; and if they are 'professionals' - in TV-industry terms, which has just about nothing to do with film-making, although the two industries do feed on each other for talent - they will slog through a couple weeks production whether they care about the concept or not.
Why not insert a porno movie at this point for two minutes and then go to commercial.
If you feel exhausted too, then you know what this film has in store for you.
The Captain and his men abuse the CID WO and then the enlisted guys knock him down and kick him.
If you want to see a pointless adventure, not induced by drugs then see this movie.
But then again, it was NOT really necessary for the plot, as we got to see in "Galaxy Quest."
Arguably, the film's most credible character is climatologist Ilana Green (Lindsay Crouse), who describes evidence of plants growing within 90 miles of the North Pole (despite the fact that there is no land above sea level that close to the Pole), and who describes data from about a dozen CO2 monitoring stations which each report about a 1% increase in atmospheric CO2 - then she concludes from this data that Earth has experienced an alarming 12% increase in CO2.
When you loose the viewing audience with boredom, then the talent takes a back seat and no one cares.
The actors look like they were given a couple lines and then told to go for it.
It's only natural then that the viewer might become frustrated by his idealistic persistance, a feeling that is shared (ironically) by his antagonists inside the movie (the abusive supervisor and the army officials).
If this is a clever trick on Kobayashi's part to have us sympathize with Kaji's enemies (and maybe feel bad about it), then I tip my hat to him.
It begins OK, but then turns into a bad slapstick movie, dated in every way - even Ed Wood's films are better!
All three leading actors where perfectly cast to play Jerome's characters, if only they had been allowed to do so then this could well have become a British comedy classic.
It must have been new then.
You also see the head moving when the actor gets replaced by the dummy of which you can then easily see the fakeness.
Parts of this movie can be very chilling and then a few moments later you want to shout "That's pretty funny".
The basic premise line is that a scientist played with stoic charm by Arthur Franz, is studying evolution and is accidentally bitten by a million year old fish which then causes the good professor to run amok on campus.
Could they then have two shreds of evidence -- or even three?
If you've never seen a version of "The Little Princess" or read the book--obviously read the novel first, then see this one.
But if the thought of Frances Hodgson Burnett's lovely story doesn't appeal to you, then by all means, see the others.
If your movie really has been funded by Bollywood gangsters and not some outside ENTITY TO WHOM YOU MUST NOD TO in the movie, in those tiring obvious ways then make the overall movie more down to earth, and not have the cadets take their national oath to the nation in English........
If you want to sell yourself, prostitute yourself, then do so a little bit more discreetly, in a slightly more sophisticated manner, with a better story, than the usual angst directionless youth finds meaning in life by joining the armed forces line.
And in the courtroom, one second, he is fooling everyone with his acting, then the next, he becomes a complete dimwit w/o the ability to improvise through anything.
Hitler & co) you hear a diatribe about the camera,and its ability to communicate, including a quote from early 20th century film star...they then quote Mary Pickford!!!
It is much worse then Steven Seagal's movies.
It's fun if you don't take it seriously, and even then it's painful to watch.
He fires the gun in a crazed attack, putting three or so bullets into the baddie, then sits down and cries.
The chemical industry had developed "memory plastic", materials that could be deformed then spring back into shape when an electric current was supplied.
Lifetime can do better then this, I know it.
Actually Perry nearly always did this, but often Matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit, pronounce it "reasonable doubt," and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party - sometimes on-camera, sometimes presumed at the end of the show.
The problem is that act one is basically that we as an audience invest in the storyline of character Jan Thomas; being released from prison, getting a job at a church, meets his love interest, and then maybe 40 minutes in, the turning point involves Jan Thomas having to face the father of the kid he supposedly murdered.
That's the biggest problem of the film, the Danish woman and her husband should have been a part of the film from the beginning on, they should be set-up properly and then gradually give us insight in their lives, to make the switch work.
--The big abandoned house makes for a pretty cool set, but then again, how many other films of this nature take place in some big abandoned house?
Maybe if you really, really really, beyond a shadow of a doubt, love nothing else but cheesy, thoughtless 80's horror, then you might like itÂ But I think we're all better off without.
You learn everything you need to know from a two minute speech at the start of the movie (the bit where the guy explains the history of the house) and from then on the story is at a stand still.
The most unrealistic part of the movie is when the assumed "Big Man on Campus" is hitting on the campus hottie who is ready to bed him, but then he turns around and says "Who is THAT?"
The camera then shoots across the room, focusing on little Linda Blair.
Kitano can masterly lull you into complaceny with his peculiar sense of rhythm and motion and then out of the blue: bam, bang and splash!
this movie started out like it was going to be very good, but then no real story developed.
I wouldn't disagree with that, but she then mentions three films to back up this view: All Quiet on the Western Front (an American film based on a novel by a German, about the German army), Paths of Glory (a film made by an American about the French army) and Gallipoli (made by an Australian about the Australian experience in the Dardanelles).
News of the couple's pending divorce brings other men Wyman's way, but naturally she's too uptight to do anything more than a little fancy dancing with them (but then that's understandable, once you get a load of graceless, nervous Aldo Ray on the dance floor).
Besides being an early film of Olivier, this film is also noted for being the film debut of Bonita Granville, then ten years old.
Filmmakers, on the other hand, like to show an actor leap into the air or shoot the ball, then cutaway to a low shot of that actor in mid-air or a shot of the ball in the air, then cutaway to the actor throwing the ball through the basket or a shot of the ball going through the basket.
Don't fool with this one unless you're an MJ junkie, and even then, only if you can stand sports themed flicks with actors with little to no athletic skill.
But then the house evidently locks itself up and nobody can get out or communicate with the outside, not even Rush.
The plot isn't too bad to begin with, but then it is neither explained nor developed...
And then again, the pencils aren't long enough to get all the way through still being able to have a grip on it!
Though i quite like the original, i absolutely hated this movie, and if it is true that Dark Castle productions are indeed planning to remake a whole host of William Castle movies then i hope they do a better job!
Throughout the film, Angela and Giovanni keep getting together only to be torn apartÂfirst by her father, then by the war, and then by God himself.
Sent off to battle, Giovanni implausibly survives a horrific plane crash, then makes a daring escape from a German prisoner-of-war camp, only to find that Angela, believing him dead, has become a nun.
You don't base a TV series on a very well liked movie franchise and then crap all over what the movies have done and shown.
Why, then, do I give this film a 4 out of 10 instead of a 1 or 2?
The action in this movie (let's not compare to Mad Max 1 or 2 then) is centered in warlord Straker who drives Battletruck to steal oil from villages.
Well anyway Hunter (Michael Beck), our hero gets involved in the plot because of a girl, that is no less then Straker's daughter.
(But then it couldn't be, since it was made in 1953 and precedes most of the films I would think it satirizes by several years.)
I don't know about you, but that never seemed to entertain me for a half hour (then again, when you have no cable and you live off of video tapes as a little kid in the 90s, what can you do?)
he then tells a story, hoping to solve his problem, and at the end of the episode, always solves his problem.
Instead of being turned down and not getting her article published until the movie is just about over (and that's the way the plot actually plays out), it might have been more interesting if somehow Kit enlists an adult to get herself published and then her articles become a sensation.
Only one stupid scene where we only see Seagal's face and then a shot from the back when his double(probably)is fighting(if you can call it that)for him.Meaning,we never actually see Seagal fighting.
If only Hopper had killed Sizemore and his partner at the beginning, then this film would have been a lot shorter.
No blood ... not even sweat was coming out, he tried to cough a little bit but my 3yr old nephew does a better imitation cough then that!
Det Fuzzy Rice dies, i thought maybe he was deliberately making his acting horrendous in order to trick Steven Segals character into thinking he was about to dye, BUT then he died!!!
I guess to anyone not familiar or has used the internet would watch this movie and then happily advocate internet controls which would basically be a system controlled by government.
And in the pit of its heart, it wants to be a great film, but then again, in my heart, I want to be a thrice published novelist contemplating my fourth book which will surely garner me a nobel prize for literature.
As expected, then, what it wants in its heart, much like what I want in mine, just is not going to occur in reality.
I had heard that this movie was bad, but then I decided to sit down and watch it.
I caught it on PBS (slightly edited) and then saw it complete on VHS in the early 1990s.
The documentary spends time on "all" the performers who died, implying that they either overdosed or committed suicide while giving no real statistical evidence that the rates are higher then in the general population.
How can someone do dozens of porno films over the span of a decade and then wonder why the "normal" entertainment industry doesn't want anything to do with him.
and how many times can someone be the one like think of something new every time someone says oh I'm the last immortal at the end of the film then there's always another load in the next one its just pitiful.
goes from one thing to another back to first and then on some other tangent.
I just looked back at my notes on Highland: Endgame, still the only other Highlander movie I've yet to see (also never seen an episode of the show), and an a little surprised at how high it was rated then even at a C+ grade.
But once that is past, then one is left with direction that seems to come out of a school that is based entirely on a time when MTV still made music videos, with touches of would-be 300 knock-off thrown in either as unintentional or as sucker-punching for genre fans.
Often during a fight the characters will be shot as if in slow motion and SPED up, and then back and forth as if there isn't any conviction in just seeing simple fight choreography.
I came into Highlander with the TV series first, then the movies.
I can't even really say that if you aren't a Highlander fan it might be enjoyable - because even then it didn't make a lot of sense.
Okay Tony Todd maybe took thing a bit too seriously (he's way too intense) and the cinematographer was very serious about America Olivo's breasts, but other then that this seems to be a joke...except its not, or if it is it never signals that it it is.
Oh, yeah, and then there was the sound.
Well, they make a very very bad movie, worst then D movie, and too late, they saw what a mistake it was.
What do they do then?
F/x is totally worst then zero.
She looked really great in the mid-90's - I wish she had done this kind of role then.
He is obnoxious and he can't even act... Movies like this should use the opportunity and their low budgets to search and try out new faces, young undiscovered talent, and not to finance and sustain a large part of the Baldwin family...  And then Kristy Swanson... How on earth do you cast an actress who is so grossly overweight for a lead role in an erotic thriller?
So then why?
So unless you want to watch C-Grade "thrillers" then don't actively seek out this film.
Murray's Larry is not the pure soul who captivated a famous writer--he is the man from "Ghostbusters," trying every now and then to be serious.
There is also no reason it could not be translated to a fiction time and place without connection to actual events and then be a successful movie without the baggage.
It blows my mind to think that this was a box office hit, but then again, we Americans seem to have a pension for paying top dollar for moron-entertainment.
And then there's good old Chuck Norris, who for some reason a few people find entertaining, but honestly, the greatest entertainment he gives me is the "Chuck Norris Facts".
There is so much wrong with this film technically and is you want to watch a clever, powerful dramatic and original action film ,then this isn't for you.
If you want to watch a predictable, satisfying, simple adrenaline fuelled kill-fest, then you'll like this.
Apply the photography, direction, acting, set design, costumes and music to a better story, and then we could have a world class movie.
They used wire work and occasional camera tricks to spice it up, but many of the sequences were done in long shot, which made it glaringly obvious that a circle of opponents was approaching one at a time to be punched ten times in the chest in real life, then die.
All of the costumes and props showed great potential for something really interesting and original, then failed to deliver on that promise.
If you're not picky about violence and just want to see an actor beat stuntmen uninterestingly, then this film is for you.
), she then leaps off the thirteen floor, plunging to her death.
Alas, it was not to be, besides the opening and a few scenes toward the end (which kind of reminded of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead 2... in style only) 1303 then degenerates into the typical J-horror flick, riddled with genre clichÃ©'s.
The victim sees something horrible off-screen and then the next scene shows them falling off the balcony.
If you've never seen an Asian horror movie then you might find it interesting but most people will watch it whilst thinking "Haven't I already seen this before somewhere?"
And then that final shot, where it becomes like a moment out of the best theater, if only for a moment.
License To Wed tells the many times told story of a young couple deciding to get married and then facing all the potential obstacles along the way.
If you like religious comedy, then here is the movie for you.
I wish everyone who wants to get married after six months should go through this guys program and then not get married.
In no time flat, the laughter turns to frustration as we find ourselves wondering why Ben doesn't just tell the dear old Reverend to go take a hike - or worse - and then seek out some religious establishment with less stringent requirements for walking down the aisle.
It begins almost at the outset where a police patrol plane begins to strafe the smugglers plane with machine gun fire even though it suspects it has people hidden in it, continues as the smuggling pilot remedies the situation and then goes on from there.
In this she seduced a shy guy and then preceded to assault him, biting his chest so that he required hospitilisation and stitches.
Maybe it's time Warner and Cunningham, who know how to whip up hype then deliver nothing at all, stop torturing people and admit to themselves they need to be in a field other than film or TV.
And, if the rich were all like Melato, then it's impossible to imagine how they all came to power, given they are idiots.
Delicious special make-up effects, like that one thing that first appears to be a talking lizard (the equivalent of a rubber sock-puppet) but then later revealed to be a midget in a rubber lizard costume.
Every now and then, Mr. Carradine, Swinger of Swords, does work in mysterious ways.
I suppose you can guess where the story is going from here - he tries to free the sorceress while staying alive and then there's a whole army of traders to contend with, most of which are quite angry as they were massacred before.
and not to forget the shot of the chopper flying home with the bright red sunset behind it and the fuel smoldering in the sun...  then the chopper returns home and they are greeted by all their army buddies, just like in Top Gun...  but then, they start chanting "USA!
But then this same exact shot with the same exact music keeps being repeated over and over and over again for almost all of the horror related scenes.
It started off well enough and held interest until about the halfway point, and then pretty much completely dropped the ball after that...  A famous sculptor's young daughter comes from her home in London to visit him in Venice.
But then, not five seconds later, he threw his urine on the guy trying to steal Tee and Baydool makes the goofiest and Tom says "That's my pee!"
And then Vulchare kills the knight.
Oil-hair boy has seduced the judge (a woman old enough to be his mother) into changing the city laws so that people can be arrested for even minor infractions such as jay-walking and then be sent to his cotton farm as free labor.
Curiously, for supposedly being fed dog food, these "untamed youth" have a surprising amount of energy to pick cotton all day, and then dance the night away without a care in the world.
It was blissfully short,but,quite frankly,this low grade tripe is just 83 minutes too long.The whole thing is just so amateur and over zealous it winds up a self indulgent mess ,serving as a poor mistake which headed in one direction,then went one cropper the other way.
Cue a confirmed ex-gangster trying to then break free from the shackles of crime.
Frankly if someone can be pursuaded to stump up money for this sorry mess of a film then surely you can do better.
The problem with the film was that the first ten minutes set up all the characters & a plot, but then that was it.
Nothing new was introduced from then on, either via character or plot.
The happy-endings, which are then tacked on, have no exhilaration, no juicy kick.
How sad to have been initially excited to find YOTD on DVD at Target, buy it, wait for the perfect moment to watch it, and then...to realize my memory was more gauze-wrapped and imperfect than I'd ever want to admit.
But then there was the high school.
The last scene, when Rourke's presence causes a riot and then he and Arianne kiss, is so corny that it's truly embarrassing.
Cecilia Roth (his then wife) and Mexican actor Gael GarcÃ­a Bernal are good actors, but they are unable to generate any emotions, because the elliptical unsastianl plot is a mix of genres and clichÃ©s.
Neither then these episodes I give the show a BIG ZERO.
By then, the plot contrivances have multiplied faster than the horses.
And then you think maybe it's supposed to be satire, except for the fact that it isn't saying anything about the real world or real people?
If every movie is sold out in the movie store and that was the only one left, then that's when I would get it.
Imagine the lamest joke you've ever heard and then stretch it out to around an hour and fifteen minutes, and you'll have a vague conception of how excruciating it was to sit through this miserable flick.
So, if your aim is to shock and offend...then you have done it John...but at the cost of losing respect from your film fans.
They beat her up and strip her partially naked--then the Prince enters with the slipper and the story continues.
Divine then is shown driving along in an amazingly cool old Cadillac.
For some excitement, Divine shoplifts and then quickly leaves the store.
The Virgin Mary then appears (naturally) and you hear a voice over of Divine repenting in spasms and asking Mary for help and forgiveness.
then appears and gives Divine a switchblade and everyone escapes--with Divine pushing Pearce away in the wheelchair.
Reporters then come to interview Divine about the accident.
A cop then arrives and begins beating Divine.
A gun and knife battle then ensues involving lots of extras.
Or did he think really hard, and then couldn't come up with anything better?
First 30 minutes were GREAT, comparable to Saving Private Ryan, then it goes to hell...  view it at your own risk  
All in all, if you liked this movie then a) you're hot for either one of the lead actors and can not think clearly b) have a limited capability of understanding quality or c) you must be joking, which is probably the case.
The only good thing about the movie is Bob Hoskins - and if that isn't a sentence to scare the living daylights out of you then you deserve this movie!
Moreland gets stuck with all the stereotypical mugging and dialect that passed for racial humor back then.
It went on the air in 1939, became hugely popular and then sputtered out in 1952 as television took over.
And then the film just sorta ends with little or no real conclusion.
Not at all a contender for being overly amusing as Stooge shorts go but when another supporting actor/actress is added that can obviously hold her own, comically, then there's hope yet.
Also the "idea" he gets about using a blow torch to first fry up the egg residue and then sweep it up.
As Godzilla approaches off-screen, it turns it's head curiously, then flies into rage when he's visible.
It goes off in one distance then changes when it's apparent it won't hit the target and curves back to hit it.
When Godzilla flies after Hedorah then brings him down and begins ripping him apart was pretty cool.
I loved the end where Jasey gave her son to the teacher to raise and then they showed the child saying that the teacher is his mother but that he came out "of my Jasey's stomach".
He goes through a metamorphosis in his life starting off as little tadpole like creatures, turns into a lizard like form with four legs, then becomes a flying saucer like form, and finally an upright walking form that is taller than Godzilla.
I guess the message of this film is that if you do not watch out and not pollute, then the result could be a giant monster made of pollution.
So then Godzilla comes in and drunk music plays, for some reason.
There's some decent early scenes in the trial, but then the proceedings erupt into anarchy and more hammy acting.
You both love this atmosphere - it doesn't seem stifling at all - yet understand how the "Angry Young Men" and then the Beatles could have wanted to blow it up.
But then these voices are so distinctive, the problem I had was in attempting to dissociate the cartoon from his real life comedy persona.
However, if you are a big fan of mullets, pedafiles, sketchy old prospectors, hoaky action sequences, bad teeth, hicks, and annoying squirrely kids with high voices...then see this movie!
This then cuts to a scene of the boy finding something about lemon mines in the attic, and a VERY wrinkly letter from "Mike Pipper".
This then cuts to a short scene about a guy unable to start his car.
And then back to the boy.
As he apparently studies about lemon mines in the comfort of his home, he is outwitted and then attacked by a hood.
After a lot of chasing, and a VERY scary grizzled mountain man who sounds like a mix of Yosemite Sam and Randy "Macho Man" Savage, the movie ends with Troy being selected as the final sacrifice, which will give the bad guy with big nostrils an invincible army of zombies, with which he can take over Canada, and then get demolished by every other country in the world.
Henchmen then go off and start searching the forest.
Anyway, and then you have all the capacity to start with: a great landscape, fairly decent actors, average budget, CGI that sucks only to a point where it's still bearable, but then... *drum roll* ULI EDEL rears his ugly head, to top it all!
But then after the movie was over, I rewound the tape so I can re-use it to record something else.
But back to "Wonder Man" -- besides some of the positive bits mentioned in other reviews here, what really first struck me subconsciously early in this movie and then I became more consciously aware of as the movie progressed is how much it seems that Jerry Lewis lifted from Danny Kaye the manic, physical bits and persona he (Jerry) later became famous for and identified with in the 1960's.
And then, try to get 1931's "Hauptmann von Koepenick" with Max Adalbert...
All of a sudden Christine loves the Phantom and immediately has sex with him, then she hates him, then she has sex with him again, then she hates him, then she loves him again!
And then there's Asia Argento, who hysterically missacts every line and botches every shot of herself lipsynching to what is undeniably and all-too-obviously somebody else's singing.
A photographer strangles homely models after he photographs them he then meets a ugly girl who strangles bums.
Some fruitcake is loitering around the streets of L.A. taking pictures of (ugly) wannabe models, all the while we hear a voice over narration as he muses about his ex girlfriend or ex wife- it's never made clear- and then strangles said wannabe models.
The Hollywood Strangler strangles model (or how she calls them, sluts, garbage and "like the rest of them") and then goes of cooling playing with his pigeons(!?)
All she does in this movie is: going to the store to open it, staring at drunk, going for the drunk, slashing the throat or stabbing the drunk and then cooling of the beach.
Perhaps the movie would have been better if Lugosi had actually played twins--then maybe two Wongs could have gotten it right!
The computer operating systems are more like Tron then what they really should be, which is a bunch of Windows or Unix machines with boring information displayed in a pedestrian and boring manner on regular CRT's.
Easily the least of the series, there's really very little to recommend here other than the rather cool final fight between Chiba and his nemesis (in other words just fast forward to the end)  Overall then, this proves to be a somewhat sad way to end the series.
If they give you a snappy script with funny dialogue, tolerable acting, characters you can care about, and enough humorous moments so that you don't miss that $8.50, then any film can make the grade.
As it turns out, I'm right, and just as I am predicting that the kids will turn on Garlin and Zahn in their tossed salad outfits then begin throwing things and attacking the vegetables, it happens on the screen.
Believe me folks, it played better as a coming attraction then it does here.
Daddy Day Care is also a lot better then The Haunted Mansion.
Henry kills a kid and brother Travis kills some other kids, then they don't but then Travis does and Henry doesn't then I turned it off and thought how I could have better spent my time.
The people in the audience were just as upset i could see them getting out of their chairs and leaving the others stayed but it was a dilemma for them they got up and then sat back down.
What Can I say about this movie that hasn't been said other then it's one of the best movies ever.
The main character here tries to act as if he's cool and slick, but with Freddi Prinze Jr. as your main catch, he's comes off and nothing more then a pretty face who thinks he can shoot some pool.
The pool shooting is quite good, not better then what is showcased in "Poolhall Junkies" but good nonetheless.
If you are looking for a bad movie to laugh at how bad it is, then you may want to watch this one.
As soon as she does another one goes off, then ANOTHER.
This is one of those movies that starts at the end and then uses flashbacks to explain how the end came about.
Who exactly then are the bad guys?
The granddaughter is forbidden to see the grandmother as an eleven year old child but then makes no effort to see her as an adult even though she professes undying love for her?
If Finding Home represents the best that Christian cinema has to offer, then I'm grateful to be an atheist.
If you're up late on a weeknight with nothing else to watch, or you're with your woman (or man) looking to set the mood, then this is a decent movie for you.
And then above all the fairy-tale end.
You wait your whole life for a film on Tibet, and then bang, two come along in the same year.
In summary: If you want to listen to a reading of The Old Man and The Sea with some pretty pictures to look at then this is the film for you.
At least it would have made sense then .
But back then, in Member of the Wedding, they actually did!
Well...if playing golf with Hitler, and getting duped into eating Alice B. Toklas brownies where they go into a "Blotto" laughing fit and hallucinate seeing white robed Ku Kluk Klan members playing hardball in slow motion, doesn't discount you, then this may be your movie of all time for political incorrectness.
If you where run over by the Miramax foreign film juggernaut, then you missed this brilliant gem tucked away in one those twenty seats cinema theater.
His flare for observing and then relaying in his film the raw human angst, is inspiring.
But then, isn't that life!
I think people should call this film what it is, a total failure, and then demand a better product.
If it is a spoiler to expect to see a madcap comedy with two actors who are really good at madcap comedy, and get a very bleak, Brechtian story, then I am guilty.
camera cuts to giant monster then back to man "I wouldn't want to mess with him!".
Hollywood strikes again...  Michael Rennie starts an Jean Valjean a convict who escapes captivity and then sets about redeeming his life.
But, his subject never seems to cooperate and instead, enjoys toying with the couple one evening aboard a yacht when a bloodied woman appears to have fallen overboard (film which conveniently goes missing) and then later, during a weekend in the producer's penthouse high rise.
If this heap of misery entitled 'Dynasty' has made so many people happy then that is fine by me.
If the Karusmakis are one of the current leaders in Europe's Filmlandschaft then Continental Europe must be in the worst shape than it's ever been.
But then after surviving those feats of endurance Ursus suddenly tells the ministers of the Kingdom about Zagro's army waiting in the forest nearby.
Like I said before, the whole script is riddled with such silly contrivances that it was almost impossible for me to enjoy it but being a fan of S&S films, it's watchable for sure, but then I would watch the cheesiest of them all and still be entertained.
By accident, she then sees this daughter in a very staged television interview.
And this business of him being such a major stud, (First he beds down a stewardess he meets, then later while he's working on the airline account, he manages to nail the owner's daughter, played by Sela Ward.)
If "Nothing in Common" was supposed to be a jab at the corporate world, then it didn't work.
If it was supposed to be a look at relationships, then it didn't work.
If I had seen this when it first came out, then I would have thought it unfathomable that Tom Hanks would ever win even one Oscar, much less back-to-back Oscars.
Don't rent this film but if it comes on TV on a Sunday afternoon you may get thru it but then go out immediately and rent "About Last Night" to cheer you up.
Characters come and go as they please with no relevance to the story, such as the archer who just suddenly appears out of nowhere and then just aimlessly follows the main characters without actually adding anything to the story.
And then...it isn't even good.
Then you take each of the parallel stories, the hidden hints and associations, and you boil it down to one sentence and reveal them in each scene, and then you have this movie.
I will NOT ruin the "Eldest" by seeing the movie (if ever one is made), unless off-course, they manage to get some promising director to direct it... And then, I doubt I will pay money to see it in the theaters.
And then there is the daughter's neighbor, played by Carlos Alvarez-Novia...a lonely old man with only his amazing dog for companionship.
I don't really recommend this movie but if you're really into movies that have to do with fantasy then you might like it.
First of all, I would dare to say that half of the events that happened in the book weren't shown in the movie at all(reason: Lord of the Rings has less then 400 pages and the movie lasts around 3 hours; Eragon has around 500 pages and it lasts around hour and a half).
If you are waiting for the next chapters to come out then you must find watching paint dry and grass grow exciting.
The story begins coherently, but falls into complete nonsense before then end.
Laughably bad, but then again, it does make you laugh.
If you carry a gun/knife, or have experience cheating on a partner who turned out to be in similar shenanigans with a masochistic rabbi, then perhaps this film will ring true.
But then, I found a review from Canadian blogger Geno Sajko, who resumes EXACTLY the outstanding feature I most remember about the show: "... they have kids doing stupid things getting them into trouble (taking the show to a attempted comedic level), and characters who acted so stupidly - not believably.
Too many episodes around some dumb tw*t doing something stupid after being asked not to, thus costing time, food, supplies etc, then rescuing them."
If you decide to watch this film then I will not be held responsible for your inevitable regret.
While the animation and style of the movie aren't half bad, in fact (besides of background stuff and vegetation not exactly moving much and the characters seeming lifeless every now and then) it seems better than a lot other animated movies (except anything by Pixar or Dreamworks of course).
And he seems to be the kind of guy that believes the best way to make you leave a city would be to make everyone else disappear so you feel unwelcome, then block all the rivers and burn all the food so you'll have to leave after a while instead of say throwing you out directly... and while that might have some sort of style it's illogical and this movie is riddled with similar stuff.
The end of the movie is the best: then at last you see that Louise CrÃ©teur has feelings and that she can cry.
I was trying to think of the worst film I have ever seen and then looked it up!
Think of the most boring home movie you have ever seen...then, divide the entertainment value in half.
One of the Troma's worst films(not has bad then "Rabbid Grannies").
It made me regret sitting thought the film, as much as I like Harrison Ford playing a bad boy now and then.
The film should have simply ended with him finding the blood hammer and then let the audience's imagination fill in the rest.
It begins with a group of criminals in suits and ties who beat what appears to be an associate of there's to death and then go out and terrorize a female clerk at a convenience store.
It also features a poorly developed plot and characters (apparently due to a rather rushed production in order to meet distributors demands), several totally unbelievable moments (Lisa being able to dismember one attacker in the bath unseen, and then even convince the gullible 'nice guy' that his partner in crime did it!)
Blah, blah, nothing new, even back then.
Three gangsters break into a guy's apartment, murder him and his lover and then seek refuge at a farmhouse inhabited by a strange girl who hardly speaks.
Three gangsters commit murder, then take to the road where they end up at the farm of a disturbed young woman.
Oh and I think everyone who has watched at least one movie would have figured it out by then.
'Anything you threw away can be found here' the child said, and then everything got sucked away by the wonder known as Re-Cycled.
Because they couldn't have stolen that footage then that's why!
Although if you are scared of cockroaches then They Crawl may make you feel a bit uneasy.
The cucarachas croak a bus driver who likes to smash his bus through office building lobbies, then somebody gets killed in a bombing.
You see, this flick begins like a low-key drama (some scenes, like Dillon's meeting with Buscemi, have a documentary-like feel that reminded me, believe or not, of Andy Warhol), then turns into a straight slasher thriller.
and i always found that weird how Hollywood also lock away films for years and then releasing them whenever.
If you seriously need a Uma fix then watch Kill Bill again-hell even watch the Avengers or Batman and Robin-at least they were so bad they are laughable unlike this piece of crap.
You'll see characters go into one location, no explanation as to why there there, and then in next scene they're at a different location.
This film is about a young and attractive woman who lures men and then rob them.
Thurman plays a femme fatale who goes on dates with middle-aged wealthy men, and then drugs them and steals their money.
Basically Berkoff points the camera at himself and then overacts for England, village hall style.
They show the town running everywhere but then realizing that the Chicken Little had just imagined that the sky was falling and had mistaken it for an acorn.
On the way there, their jeep overheats and the female guide is kidnapped by a cannibal tribe, dragged off to their village and is then sliced open and eaten.
But then again, I and people around me were literally (and I'm actually not exaggerating now, this is true) were laughing out loud in a handful of scenes from the horrible, horrible dialogue and embarrassing acting.
The problem with this movie, which is essentially eye candy(well it was back then), is the acting.
If your children like dinosaurs, then stick to Barney (the dinosaur, not Barney Rubble) or the animated Land Before Time series.
When they get older, then introduce them to the documentary (animated, but as realistic as it can be) Walking With Dinosaurs.
It then "bursts into flames" when the overeager rescuing pilots have to be restrained from going searching for the Duke without any idea of what to do or where to go.
The Joe Armstrong character is more tougher and believable then Sean Davidson character played by Bradley.
More ninjas attack them badly, or it could be the same five identically dressed ninjas taking turns to crawl off screen and then leap out of elevators, outhouses, fridges etc.
Some badly acting people unwisely try to introduce a plot about something, I dunno what, there's flashing lights and needles and Fourth Reich kinda guys, then some woman pulls off a mask and WOW!
noises, and then aliens attack and Will Smith blows them up KA-BOOM!
but then Darth cuts off Luke's hand, and he's all like "Aargh, I have no hand!
", and old Mr Jones uses the Force to heal Big Head guy's soul and Will Smith pulls off his mask and he's really Joan Cusack but with Yoda's beard, and at that point I woke up and thought "MAN, that was a wierd dream", but then back in the movie, Big Head guy turned into the hulk or something, and I realised that my fevered imagination really has nothing on the guy who wrote "American Ninja 3: Blood Hunt".
to attempt reconciliation perhaps, Louisa opens up a can of class-consciously aware worms in response, but then is shut out, turned off, and eliminated from the rest of the film entirely.
He gets in, kicks everyone's tail and then leaves the place...  Did anyone catch that...  no one...
If Brosnan somehow transferred his memories to Lesley-Anne Down, then why do we mostly get a third-person's point-of-view of his life in the flashbacks, with only brief and random intervals of his own point-of-view?
In Crime Spree it just pops up an hour into the movie and then disappears.
It's like the editor discovered a new trick on the Avid and then got sick of it before he knew how to use it.
If you want to direct our attention to the only one of the three splits that's moving, then don't use a split screen.
and then a moment later, before the next reel started, "WHY?"
If there wasn't any good gore, then at least I would have expected unintentionally humorous results, but sadly, this film fails to deliver the expected elements of entertainment that a horror fan would imagine in a film of this kind.
!You are more likely to be stuck in traffic or divorced from your spouse then go through what these cheese balls are going through!
I'm sorry, if the Government can't keep a simple burglary secret, then I can't believe they could get away with making illegal bio-weapons.
Then please, please spend more then a mere 25 grand, I can't stress this enough, spend more then 25 grand.
They should of started with Ryu's Story without messing it up and then maybe down the line had the story of Chun-Li.
The scene where she's thinking this is what she will have to do and then told exactly what it is she will do is done perfectly, and the look on her face is awesome as she comes to realize just what a hostess actually does.
But then there's that dying grandson hanging over her head, so she chooses to do something that repulses her in order to help out to save her grandson.
I was pretty excited about this movie.. then bad reviews kept me from seeing this movie in theaters.
The film raises questions we as viewers shouldn't need to ask...and then we never get answers to those questions!
Now at first I thought this is how he would start, then later in the movie he would get his Psycho Powers.
And then of course there's the generic cop team trying to investigate and not having one clue as to what to do until near the very end, when all they do is storm a building.
Balrog is a big black guy....and Vega wears a mask and claws....albeit a shiny silver mask that makes him look more like Jason then anything IMO.
And then he's on screen fighting for, oh, 1 minute 20 seconds, if that, and then poof, he's gone.
I was pumped and on board, and then...
In all, its a pretty B grade series with the worst CGI I've ever seen in my life and one wonders, if one cannot take the dinos seriously due to how unconvincing they look, then why watch the series at all?
: well, first of all, the special effects where made(apparently) with Microsoft Paint, its worse then Barbara Streisand, and thats really, really bad.
The screenplay, if one can call this one note monstrosity that, was written by Shore and some guy named Kirk Fox, yet it all smacks of being a vanity project, laced with bad one liners where the B listers try to recall who Shore was, after his 'death', then rail against him when exposed.
I rented this movie not knowing that Pauly Shore directed it, if I knew he did I might have not seen it, then again I think he deserves a second chance.
If you want to watch a movie that includes Pauly Shore quoting his other movies, with a lot of cameos in it, that shows on several occasions Pauly Shore masturbating, then this movie is for you.
The bottom line is if you are interested in music or the entertainment business and have low expectations and 90 minutes to kill, then there are worse ways to spend your time than by watching Sunset Strip.
Or if you wanted to make a film about groupies and English rockers (who wouldn't be playing at the Whiskey for crying out loud) then why not make a film about Rodney Bingenheimer's English Acid where cute underage Valley girls hooked up with stoned out limey superstars.
They could have easily set the film in today's Hollywood and then at least the film might have been more marketable, and the retro music might have made more sense.
(The film's English superstar band sounded a lot more like the Psychedelic Furs then Led Zeppelin.)
If that is the case, then I believe Muzaffar Ali is a fantastic story-writer and screenplay-writer.
There is a thin line (if any) between a tawaif and a prostitute/hooker - old Umrao sleeps with Nawab Sultan as a matter of routine, and then with the robber Faiz Ali.
Technically, the photography in old Umrao is not as high quality as in the new one but then in 25 years cameras have improved a lot.
brand of Scottish dialect is beyond all but the finest mimics.Here,that beautiful treasure - house is raped,plundered then trampled over in favour of a generic accent like a third - rate touring company fumbling their way through "The Scottish Play" on a wet Tuesday night in Hull.An honourable exception is Mr Trevor Howard as the Advocate - General,a splendid exposition of the Upper - Class Scotsman,at home neither with the English nor his own countrymen.
The film then proceeds to waste your time with a dozen commentators who all seem to agree on everything.
Oh and then of course I'm sure all kids want to have images of winding up in the trunk of a car with their best friend, who has been shot in the head.
I'm not exactly sure if they changed writers or what's happened but basically for the first four seasons it was going in a nice escalating pace and then somewhere in the beginning of the fifth it just became dark and stayed that way.
Unfortunately the film then peters out and the rest of it meanders along with no sense of tension or character development.
It is as though the writer came up with what he thought was a good idea, and then after writing a few pages realised that in fact he still had writer's block.
Posing as a representative from a farming company needing to fill tractor orders, he gains the trust of the town and in particular, a woman (Melissa Gilbert) and her young daughter who buys his story, trusts him, and then, along with the whole town, shuns him when they find out that he might be cutting their job.
Every now and then a remarkable small film is made.
Do yourself a favour, instead of watching this movie, do something a lot more entertaining than watching this horrendous piece of junk movie, such as gnawing of each of your digits one by one, or, say, slamming your head as hard as you can into a the frame of a car door and then subsequently closing the door on your head as hard as you can over and over.
Check that out, then watch this if you love the show, but don't keep your hopes too high.
", and then whoosh, the "Deathstalker two" title-logo comes on.
And like if the opening-credits weren't enough to make us reflect on this movie in a grinning or dumbly drooling fashion, then wait until the end-credits start to roll.
The first scene has our hero acting like Indiana Jones as he sneaks into a castle (the shot is lifted from Corman's own movie "The Terror," to steal a gem but then has to fight his way out.
This whole movie is supposed to take place in two days but within two days Anne goes to Athens and back then goes away again with her sister.
Criteria" as if at a labor rally, then becoming an army divided into three battalions that converge on a single SF intersection in pursuit of the Bachelor.
If the audience is expected to buy this, then the main character's a nut job whose weird logic tells him to build his wife a garden while he plods along, ever ready to escape abroad.
The couple then let out a whimper, "Isn't this movie going to EVER end?!?"
Well, yes, we get this rather soon, and then we suffer through the restÂ Perhaps slow movies are not exact equivalents of slow food, after all.
You're in Europe, then China, then Europe, then China.
Someone's reading a letter, someone's playing billiards, then letter then billiards then flowers.
But then everyone else was equally tiresome.
His wife then replaces Keira in his dreams of the river, but decently clothed...  You don't buy it, do you?
It is beyond me why, when they were supposed to be French, they didn't just hire real French actors and actresses - even if they then tried to speak English it would have been more authentic sounding.
Amazingly the director also directed 'The Red Violin', a first rate film in almost every way - he must have been drinking himself into a coma every day since then or had a nasty accident that damaged his brain.
The tale of an an aging movie actress, over 40, put out to pasture by the major studios, and driven by loneliness to alcoholism and then to child abuse didn't strike me in the least bit amusing.
Asked by a reporter if she thought the allegations brought against Miss Crawford by her daughter were true, Miss Arden paused and then said: "Joan tried to be all things to all people.
); she has a swimming contest with her daughter than gloats when Christina loses, then Christina says it's not fair so Joan spanks her and locks her up in a pool house.
Not living up to her mother's exacting standards, Christina is shuttled off to boarding school and then convent school.
The only guy in the film who looks like he has any training only appears for about 2 minutes and then gets lamely knocked over by the lead character.
The editing is terrible (people will jump off a wall dressed as a ninja and land dressed regularly, then 4 seconds later be a ninja again, and so on).
If you want a rating based on sheer (if unintentional) hilarity then go and tack another 3 stars on the end!
Polley's character would get to say one disturbing or strong thing, then have go on acting so obviously well below her & her character's intelligence.
But if you liked all that white-light business in "Kissed" & if you could tolerate the preposterous situation of Cats & Dogs, then maybe you will like this film.
He insults her, she runs away, she insults him and then comes back, they insult each other and reunite.
To me, it's a failure to make a stand, an excuse for the writer to dump a truckload of contradictions into a character then sneak away without explaining any of it.
If you are so desperate to watch this...then count backwards from 5 million and do it while chewing bubblegum and skipping rope, because you will enjoy it ten times more and it will make just as much sense.
The men that injured and killed and then stayed so were at the Russian site.
This animated offering uses similar elements to Schumacher's then fresh-in-the-memory disaster Â Robin, Mr.
And yeh the twist was good idea, but for 2 mins then the end, come on ppl that was a let down tbh.
Overall: Good start, then awful throughout, then a disappointing ending !
If there is any punishment for horrendous in-consequence and total idiocy then he has surely deserved it.
In a society where the scoundrels have the say so - who will then believe authority in a crisis?
We get 20 minutes of grief, anger, frustration, then mental exhaustion, before he is finally convinced to seal the house against the impending toxic pollution.
the house, then returns home...giving up rather easily on the woman he supposedly loves.
She returns, turned away from the hospitals, and then the two sit there, for a good ten/twenty minutes, talking.
There was one moment throughout the whole movie when it evoked some emotion other then boredom and disgust, and that was when Lexi put her had through the back door and dropped the phone and contaminated ash in the house, i felt anger that she would do that to her husband who she supposedly loved (allthough i got no sense of any connection between her and her husband) i feel bad for the actors it was not there fault they got the parts, in fact i admire that they made the appalling script come to life, its not there fault it was badly written.
i've seen Â£100 budget movies that were better then this.
If the original "ash disease" wasn't airborne, then why was the whole city getting sick?
When the wife returns, she says her friend shot a bunch of people and then drove off.
If the creator of this movie is retarded, then I forgive him.
She had been close to ground zero and exposed for days so if anyone should die, then she should.
She then she breaks one of the glass panes with her mobile phone that lands on the floor covered in toxic dust thus breaking the protective seal of the house.
Rory Cochrane then repeats his "bug shower" scene from "A Scanner Darkly", but this time with a bottle of bleach, in order to cleanse himself from the toxic dust contact (in fact most of his darting paranoid looks seem to work equally well in both movies).
The wife then finds a child that has come out of a car with its alarm turned on, i.e.
Why then were we shown, in earlier scenes, cops taking people off streets by handcuffing them and bundling them into vans, but now find out that they're ignoring everyone gathered outside the hospitals?
They grab the wife and then .... tell the husband that his non-air-conditioned house has incubated the bomb's organisms and the sealed environment has meant that his house now has a deadly concentration of same.
By airing the WB episodes first and then releasing this movie in 1998 was a mistake I felt.
Tiffany Shepis then puts in a cameo and manages to make it through a long lesbian scene without losing any of her clothing.
Since then, things have spiraled out of control and the zombie girl has infected several other students (including Ms. Shepis) who lurk around in the house.
Then it's off to a bar to get back at a drunken Clare, and then to a carnival.
If strawberry syrup and Fruit Roll-Ups are disgusting gore to you, then this is the film for you.
Other then that, this film really should have upped the sleaze factor, as the brief nudity in the film was all it had going for it.
"Filme da Treta" is, then, just an adaptation to the movies of this succeeded show, but it was, at least in my point of view, a regression!
The ending to the film is the part that made the least sense, and perhaps if they would have tried harder to come out with a better ending then I would have been happier, but they didn't.
If a friend offers to loan you a copy of the 'ATHF Colon Movie', accept it, then punch them in the face and burn the DVD.
The Creator, who has a half man, half drum set person who sings "The Song of Life" every time the talking piece of watermelon wants to bring something back to life, but then again I'm not completely and pointlessly insane.
Actually, before I went in, I thought wouldn't it be a great idea to smoke pot and then watch it?
Either way... don't wind up like me: p-ed off, wishing for his 90 minutes back, spending an additional 20 minutes writing a review about just how p-ed off you are and then posting it for everyone to see and having the people who weren't p-ed off at the movie, in turn, p-ed off at you.
It starts out with the main character getting raped by an inmate--then we see him engage in a near pornographic display with a hooker.
Zombies breaking right through windows, then seconds later, being stopped dead in their tracks by another window; zombies jumping at great distances & crawling on the walls and ceilings, but then not being able to reach a few characters peeking through an air duct; zombies' heads exploding because their bodies have caught fire, (WTF???)
So I didn't know if I should put this point in the Pros or Cons listÂ If this wasn't a remake of "Day of the Dead", which is what I choose to believe, then it would be a purely good thing.
If you're really into zombie movies then you'll like this one but if you're a George A. Romero fan then you might want to pass on this one.
They then could have added the radio station and maybe some people trapped in their houses and even some still on the street.
Oh yeah, and then there is the gun firing zombies, and the empathic zombie, who happens to be so forcefully in love with the protagonist that he overcomes his zombie-hood, and collaborates with the band of survivors - lets not give too much thought to the point that they've met each other approximately half a day prior to zombie-transformation.
He spends his time fishing then looks for a way to cure his wife who lives in a frozen state.
If you can forgive its short length then you'll really enjoy this movie   Kevin Conroy has the coolest voice ever
Not only is Ving not the same character as he was in Dawn of the Dead but then they had the audacity to kill him off with the first thirty minutes and turn him into a pathetic, eye-eating, legless zombie.
The only thing that saved this movie from making me really angry was the fact that I had it recorded it on DVR and I could fast forward through most of it and then have the satisfaction of hitting 'DELETE' when it was over.
Since then though it's been slightly down hill with some poor further attempts released.
If you didn't like that then you'll hate this.
In an ideal world, the impatient cash hungry studios would have waited for Zack to finish 300 and then signed him on to the project.
If you can't do it well then don't do it!
A colleague of his says 'If what you said about them retaining some of what they were is true, then we are so f*cked'.
As English lines continue the march to Concord, Adam's friend Solomon predicts "It'll be easier for them to go down that road then it will be for them to come back."
Solomon predicts that "It'll be easier for them to go down that road then it will be for them to come back."
However, the film attained it's nasty status primarily because of the graphic cover of a hobo being drilled in the head and also because it had a catchy and memorable title which the British tabloids could bandy about whenever they produced an article about the dangers that this new breed of violent films posed to civilisation as we then knew it.
If you are a fan of exploitation cinema then certainly check this movie out but please be aware of what this film is not - it isn't a mindless slasher or serial killer gore-fest.
It was initially banned in Britain and Germany and then released with cuts in 1999 and re-released uncut in 2002.
We then have 45 minutes of pointlessness such as a band moving in, the main characters talking about how they need money, and the guy complaining about noise and how his girlfriend won't shut up about when is the painting going to be done.
And then he starts to kill hobos with a power drill.
And at the end, i don't know if this was a glitch of somekind like a bad transfer or something, but after he kills his ex girlfriend's new boyfriend, she begins to call for him because she doesn't know he's dead, and then the screen turns red for about 3 minutes and you can't see a damn thing.
And then it cuts to the credits.
And even then it was painful.
But then, this movie is not about them, but 2 middle-aged men who have been coddled by their parents and not only still live at home, are waited on hand and foot.
The plot is about these losers who still live at home, unemployed 40-year-olds who live with their mother and father they meet and they develop a relationship and get married Ferrel and Reilly hate each other and Ferrel does the worst thing in any comedy movie (besides Charlies Angels 2 with hiring those writers(even though writers isn't a word to describe them) he puts his balls on Reilly's drum set (no wonder earlier in this piece of crap he said "Don't touch my drum set") and then they find out they have more in common and they decide to start a new music band (REPLACE THE DRUM SET) and then Ferrels younger brother is in town this guy is a success with a love relationship Ferrel says he's an ###hole and the brother sells their house and they try to get it back by doing the unthinkable like dressing up as Natzi's and putting makeup on Ferrel's face trying to make out he's dead (if only it was real) and later Ferrel's younger brother runs out of people to sell it to and one night they release their first music video see they wanted to be in this band with 2 people the step-brothers and Reilly's father owns a boat and that's where they were filming it while it was in the water with nobody driving it.
Well, then, you're a disgrace to humanity, and this movie is for you!
So then we get the end of the movie, which turns things around and sees the two guys reforming themselves and starting to live real lives.
If you think this movie is funny then you have terrible taste in comedy.
They then learn to grow up.
Like only then they realized how ridiculous and unfunny it all was.
Farrell and Reilly's characters hate each other upon sight and bicker insufferably until they realize they are cut from the same degenerate cloth and then become best pals.
If you loved the other movies made in this vein, then you'll surely like this too.
If you find yourself tiring of Ferrell with each release, then save yourself some time and skip it, because "Step Brothers" will probably be the film that'll break the camel's back.
If you were ever an innocent adolescent and can recall your first infatuation with a girl with a wry smile, then this will make you laugh at yourself and cry at the same time - what more can you ask from a film?
I have seen the movie Knight Rider 2010 and do agree that it is not the best.in fact,it is extremely poorly produced.However-I think Tug 3 should get his facts right.James Doohan is in Knight Rider 2000,and not Knight Rider 2010.Dont' roll over my leg KITT!In any event the original is a great show which,although very eighties,still carries enough punch to make the grade.Reading about how some of the stunt work was done makes the big budget shows of today a bit naff.some of KN might seem a bit cheesy,but then again,some cheeses have a great flavour.and if super pursuit don't blow your mind just see a black pontiac close up-KITT is timeless.cue purple sunset
I find one parallel with Knight Rider, though: In the pilot of Knight Rider, Michael Knight is almost killed, and then reconstructed with essentially a new body.
If you're expecting the hairy chest of David Hasselhoff and the retro cool Pontiac of KITT then don't bother with this movie.
If you haven't seen those two episodes yet then you must, they are pure comic genius with Hasselhoff playing Michael Knight's evil twin brother Garth, with a ridiculously massive fake stuck on beard!, classic.
If in the original Knight rider series, if Wilton had Michaels face constructed in Garths image then why is he as well as looking like him in the face, has he got the same afro hair, the same height, the same build??.
he meets up with this scientist guy who wants to steal his organs using this soul-stealing crystal thing, the immigrant smuggler guy's girlfriend gets her soul trapped in the crystal instead, immigrant smuggler guy then puts the crystal into a car he built from scraps of a Mustang.
Because if they told the prison that they are from CDC and the prisons officers would confirm this and the CDC would say they are from CDC but they in fact are from that big pharmaceutical company, then it would mean that the CDC and the company are both involved and they wouldn't even need to lie.
If you're not used to Scottish accents then you may find some of the dialogue passing you by but in truth, you get used to it.
But then again, my fiancÃ©e is Scottish so I probably have something of a head start!
Examples of the latter: our hero deciphers an impossible dead language during an airplane flight, and from then on can fluently interpret the book containing clues to the mysteries to come.
The main reason I'm posting this comment is point out that there are NO NUDE scenes featuring the femme fatal Christina app legate so if you mistook the R-rating,and the cover showing Appplegate pole-dancing as an implication that you're gonna see a "money shot" then do yourself a favor, don't make the same mistake I did when it first came out and don't bother renting it.
Its actually a really depressing movie, so if you're into soppy love stories then you might enjoy it.
If you have ever paid to hear or see one of these people, or bought one of their books, then you have my deepest sympathy.
It's like my cable lineup is the all Frasier channel, all the time, then, when Frasier is over, Becker reruns.
If I ever see him in an airport or anything, I swear to Christ I will kick him in the balls, then I will roar and beat my chest.
Wastes the first hour wandering about plot-wise, then when the Mother is introduced, she is impossibly harsh (so harsh that the plot device of Beth asking for her help isn't believable, an elopement (or suicide) would have been more believable (and quicker!))
If you can stomach that kind of stuff, then you should be able to get through this.
Not recommended viewing, but if you have nothing better to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon, then ...
If you love watching a pasty, boring dude eating a sandwich.....driving a car.....walking......etc., then this movie is for you!!
And the scene where Karloff approaches the killer may be well thought-out but combined with the ensuing face-slapping it belongs more in a comedy or a fantasy then a movie which strives for realism.
All in all then, not worth the effort.
Once the movie starts and you get into it you begin to unravel the plot pretty quickly and then it's just a matter of time before the some teenage killings and some sex like all horror movies need to have.
When the most horrific thing in a scary movie is the awful fashion sense of its characters, then you know you've picked a real turkey; admittedly, the extra large shoulder pads, baggy checked trousers with extremely high waist, and nasty perms are all fairly amusing, but they do not make up for this film's inability to scare, its lack of gore, or the complete absence of a decent plot.
Escaping from his asylum with ease, he makes a quick stop at a store to pick up a hunting knife, and then hot foots it to the sorority house, where he begins to hack up the girls (and their boyfriends, who, this being a cheesy 80s slasher flick, drop by to party).
If the film revolves around Gregory and his tribulations, then the film does a good job in establishing a sense of distance between viewer and object of the protagonist's desire.
The money shot occurs when the murderer is coming after the sorority girls, falls two stories off a ladder, then is able to spontaneously crash through the window minutes later.
But I can tell you that, if you watch the trailer then you have seen the whole movie.
He then goes out of his way to slander him, and put forward his own image of happy go lucky magical America in which everyone, and i paraphrase 'loves everyone around them, and is safe all the time'.
In this entire film Wilson comes up with one original tool for propaganda- he shows himself deceiving someone (very lightly, because he isn't the bad guy here) - him and the producer then have a ridiculous moral conflict about the action - then they show Wilson realizing his mistake and apologizing to the camera.
Moore should have granted the interview; the film would then have lasted about 10 minutes.
And this, of course, is not good since as a fact he then becomes Moore.
He is accusing Moore of editing his movies and then he does the same thing himself.
He makes a point of Moore using comments and interviews out of context and then, yes you guessed right, he does it himself.
He challenges Sauron, and then wrenches the palantir away from the Eye to use as HE wills, not as Sauron wills.
Since in the book Gandalf has told Frodo that 'Sauron is taking shape again' why on earth didn't Jackson then develop Sauron from the figure in film I?
The whole point, and if this isn't obvious in the world today then Jackson is even less astute than I imagined, is that evil in many guises takes human form.
Worst of all, I felt that by ROTK Jackson was even getting sloppy on what had been a trademark of the films until then - set design and scale.
Unfortunately this decision to try and make the plot more mysterious back fires during the middle third as it gets somewhat boring waiting for something to happen but then things explode into a gore drenched finale.
Overall I'm glad I watched it, certainly not the best film in the world but then did anyone really expect it to be?
Faith Clift the lead actress looks and acts like a dead zombie who's been lobotomized and then drugged , Charles (Richard) Moll , with the ever changing wigs looks and sounds lost , Marc Lawerence in a dual role is horrible in both ''roles'' and finally Robert Bristol the prissy Satan rep on earth is about as scary as whipped cream .
Victor French and his gang which includes his idiot brother Solomon Sturges steal a solid gold cannon from the museum in Chapultepec near Mexico City and then schlep the item to the border where French then proceeds to pin the crime on former gang member Elvis Presley.
And when he finally gets his dream date with Dorothy and is lead from pillar to post, by first one girl then another he takes it all in his stride.
Some films are so poor that they become laughably enjoyable or mildly entertaining and then there's this, which is just downright painful.
If you want to live a happy and fulfilling life, then avoid this at all costs, however, if you decide to watch it someday, please purchase a pack of razor blades to accompany the viewing.
And then when he goes into hypnosis and describes himself as a Jewish woman in World War II Poland.
And then to top it all off, Mulder raises his hands and starts walking across the field toward the barn where they were firing from moments before, doing his best "Dances With Wolves" impression.
I think they used up all their creative energy on "Home" and then just threw this crap together at last minute.
OK I think one more thing then I will move on to the things I liked.
(She heads for the door then looks back.)
Our film is then interrupted for a short documentary on lizards.
However, the movie gets her recruited into the zombie-clan within five minutes and then she disappears.
Evil Eddie's gang then all go to the Wise Dragon fortune cookie warehouse to eat all the fortune cookies.
Johnny arrives at the warehouse and fights one (1) zombie and wins, because then Evil Eddie's voice can growl out of the shadows in an amused tone, 'Your kung-fu is impressive', so the viewers can quake with fear at how powerful Evil Eddie must be.
But then, she made that terrible movie about being the shy, nice girl who gets the popular hunk... which is completely the wrong message.
And then life imitated art, when Mandy started seeing hunky arrogant bad boy tennis player Andy Roddick.
EVERYTHING happens in this movie...from weddings, to funerals, then a pregnancy, and it is thoroughly predictable.
I think if it wanted to squeeze in all of this then they should have made it into a sitcom.
Aww...the circle of life... then close in on all the characters making stupid googly eyes at the new baby.
Granted, this is hard to gauge, but then I started to realize that other films pull this off very well.
I know people were easier to scare then.
But then suddenly...the anger was gone and 'Archie' was able to act in the same (slightly patronising in my opinion) manner as before.
Things would happen, then change in the drop of a hat, so much so that you'll find yourself thinking "what just happened here?"
The action scenes only get worse from then on.
The camera shots where great but the actionÂ.well if you call a lot of gun shots action, then, I guess this movie has a lot of action.
As a result, Korea then permanently becomes a part of Japan.
I loved the end to the film and whenever i had a date with a girl in the eighties and nineties my mind would flashback to a certain clock tower, a white jacket (without the stain),a beret,whistling, horizontal dancing and kissing with numbers.Unfortunately my dates would never hit the heights of Gregorys date but if i was fortunate to get the girl home then without fail the Gregorys video would be shown to what would normally work in my favour.
A witch changes her, and then he spends the rest of the movie trying to get laid.
I should take a trip to Germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about Germany as the "land of Nazis" or some such.
One IMDb user makes the astounding claim that this movie is beautiful, then goes on to suggest that the acting is not as bad as other reviewers claim.
The art direction is of a totally different style then Ninja Scroll and Resurrection is only an hour long, if that.
If you've never seen it then stop everything and go to ebay or amazon and get buying.
Through flashbacks within other flashbacks we're treated to a background story of how a Vietnam vet named Joe Corey was wounded and then "helped" by a wacky scientist named Dr. Vanard (the always welcome John Carradine) who planted some sort of mechanism inside Corey's head and unintentionally turned him into a murderer with a taste for jewel robbing (which is how the old 1964 heist footage managed to get utilized).
What an awesome opener, you'd think Â but then Adamson suddenly opted for a completely retarded and incoherent narrative structure, involving long & confusing flashbacks and unrelated sub plots.
Perhaps then you could spend a little more time in the relationship between Robert and Marc to justify why they end up together at the end, other than rom com conventions of the Hollywood 40s and 50s and bad Broadway musicals of every era, say they must.
Writers are on a journey; they know where they are going and then plan how to get there.
Sure enuf, you "go see" and then, after 15 minutes, you just want to "go" period.
In this movie, we see a priest let the wandering mower-man live in a little shack in back of his church, and then he whips the man!
Apart of course from the blonde's a**hole, which the brunette analyses kindly as she herself is considering anal bleaching, they then proceed to dry hump each other against the changing room door... it was at this point I was compelled to look away, for good.
Still, the film could be really good for what it is attempting, cut the brakes and full gas and all that stuff, but then at least they should have gotten the special-effects right so the scorpion king didn`t look like a plastic doll.
If you're thrilled by amusing one liners and nonstop special effects of all kinds of weird creatures, then you're sure to enjoy this second Mummy picture.
Most of the characters do a lot of traveling and then have a showdown.
They took the first movie, then instead of taking all the good stuff, they just condensed the Bad Taste In My Mouth parts.
My grandmother says this "comedy" wasn't even funny, to her, back then.
If you are so starved for frontal nudity, I guess you could turn the sound off and get a few nice bodies to look at now and then.
If the main character does not annoy you to death, then Billy's (played by Jonah) portrayal of a masochist in an S&M relationship will!
That great droll Mr Chic Murray gives one of then great British movie performances as the Headmaster whose school,like some huge new - fangled machine,seems to have mastered perpetual motion.
The story then becomes laughable when the Navy decide, for some reason, to re-enact the last voyage of the Submarine by piecing together the movements from the Captain's Log.
There was lots of submarine jargon which went over my head, so unless you have a particular history with or an interest in submarines, then I'm assuming most people would have the same problem... and so it got a little confusing.
It captures the boredom of a new town, then rips one character's life, such that it was, to pieces by having a girl replace him on the football team.
The movie starts out as a message about destroying/preserving the beautiful land that the money hungry developers want to consume, but then transcends into a romance between the two fractions of indifference.
While Leon Ichaso deserves a panning for his take with the film, in truth, the only vaguely interesting things about the real MP was his bad art & why it caught on (briefly & limitedly) & then disappeared- as a man he was a cipher, thus the film's worship of 'art' over humanity, not to mention its ridiculous conflation of import on MP by counterpointing the protagonist against documentary footage of celebrities like Muhammad Ali, Richard Nixon, Ayatollah Khomeini, & John Lennon).
John Gordon Sinclair and Dee Hepburn were absolutely wonderful in this story of teenage love and the sudden twists & turns that occur when you think you've met THE ONE, but then someone else...
It then follows into cheap comedy, that doesn't make you laugh a single bit.
2.If you thought that you could at least see six hotties (Ayesha, Esha, Soha, Arti, Sophie & Riya) then you won't get to see much of them.And when you'll get back home you won't even remember if there was one Miss Riya Sen (or some other actress) in the film.
3.If you saw Munnabhai MBBS and you think Sanju baba can tickle your funny bone like no one else then what you get from our original Bhai in this film is a score of not-so-funny shayaris which he proudly called Misals.
4.And if you didn't take all these things seriously and you decided to see it once for yourself then I will pray for you and I'll hope that a massive powercut occurs in your area and you are not able to watch the climax.
i mean, if the Indian audience found the lines hilarious, then they must get a reality check.
If you do manage to find a version available somewhere, then don't spend too much of your hard earned cash, because I'm telling you it's just not worth it.
If you're looking for gratuitous gore and shock tactics then try and find an uncut copy of Giallo a Venice or The Grim Reaper instead.
It made a refreshing change from American high school movies which, then as now, generally used established actors in their late twenties or even thirties; the unkind joke about Stockard Channing's character in "Grease" was that she would leave school when she passed her exams or had her menopause, whichever happened first.
Just about everything he directed turned to gold and those that didn't then (Boomerang, Panic in the Streets, Face in the Crowd) have that respect today.
And for those who've said I have to watch all the episodes, rewind scenes I found slightly funny and watch them again, then let the whole thing sink in as I meditate on its comic subtlety -- huh?
And then, the best friend somehow falls in love with the husband?
The film has few redeeming features, but the main one is that it is quite a good laugh to watch with a few mates when drunk, especially at the hilarious musical score and the cheap and nasty production values, (at one point it actually switches from widescreen to normal, then back to widescreen a few minutes later).
Like Alex (Lucy Liu) that climbed a mountain and then to a helicopter wearing high heels!
But then Vivian (Kelly Lynch) goes: "Never send a man to do a womanÂ´s job."
Oh and a family member is sicker then expected.
Being there are so little types of these movies being made I believe a lot of people crave them and are more then willing to over look the ineptness of this movie.
From the creators' point of view, if you portray this movie as a potentially realistic thriller, then at least give the audience some credit...
And then there's the plot holes: John Clark can't or won't speak Russian?
Until then he should content himself with learning that Paris is the capital of France,Vienna is the capital of Austria.....are you paying attention?I'll be asking questions later.....
The plot involves neo-Nazi's who obtain an Israeli nuclear bomb (from an Israeli plane that was shot down in the 1973 Yom Kippur war) and use Russian nuclear scientists to refurbish it, and then ship it to Baltimore (just in time for the Super Bowl) to try to blow up the President of the US.
The Nazi's goal is to trick the US into thinking the Russians carried out the attack, hopefully starting a nuclear war which then allows the neo-Nazi's to do what exactly?
), he personally sifts through the rubble of Baltimore for evidence (another inexplicable change, as Denver was the city nuked in the book, then goes on for a cliched confrontation with the terrorists (who are VERY poorly developed character-wise, totally unlike the book) mano y mano in a darkened Baltimore warehouse.
This movie will probably be remembered more for it's unfortunate post-9/11 release date (which gave it a sense of importance) then the silly story and content.
ÂAt least, that's what we're lead to believe, but then the story sort of shifts away from that and becomes a clichÃ© ghost story.
Someone got a decent idea to start with, but then they were lazy about every other aspect of the production after that point.
The main character 'Jake Sawyer' is so bland that all he seems to do in this movie is tattooing people and then following them to a club/party whatever to meet asshole after asshole after asshole, seriously nearly every person he meets is an asshole.
There's also the moments when Jake tattoos people, they just sit down in his chair & the goes to work, they never say what they want or where they want it & then these people just get up & walk out without paying, I'm not being funny but if I was having a tattoo (which would be for life) then I'd at least want to pick the design & where it was going.
She goes to live with a sex starved female and they soon kick up a relationship; but then the nightmare rapist manifests himself and a strange love triangle develops.
Now, I'm all for sexploit films, and usually plot doesn't necessarily need to be a key-point - but for the kicker to this one is that it introduced several interesting plot-points, and then never followed through with them.
The opening crypt sequence features any number of hilariously named members of the infamous vampire familyÂand, then, Zoltan itself (oversized fangs and all) emerges from inside a coffin!
Adding to the inescapable feeling of absurdity here is a cheesy score; the twist ending, then, is entirely predictable but also incredibly daft.
He then helps his master, who decides to track down the last surviving heir of Dracula.
), and its two risible sex scenes (an old wheelchair-bound patient being serviced out in the rain by a young nurse and Ekberg herself picking up a man at a cafÃ© and then making love in the corridor of his apartment-building).
All I can say here is that if you're a Sean Bean completist, as I am, you'll want to watch this--and then check it off your list.
If I wanted to watch a rubbish version of Phenomenon I would of gone to a high school musical version of Phenomenon and even then I have the option to throw things on stage.
If you're into the whole 'B-Movie' thing like I am, then what more could you ask for?
If you're bored one day and feel like watching a movie that makes you cringe and laugh for all the wrong reasons, then check this movie out.
But then what else would you expect when it stars Dennis Rodman?
And then there's the acting...Dane Clark, as Rodman's bumbling sidekick, pours it on thick with what is meant to be comic relief, but is neither comic nor relief; at NO MOMENT is he even BARELY amusing.
Oh, and then there's the, ahem, "special effects".
The cabin would be almost empty in one scene, then the next scene, there would be someone in every seat.
If you like bad acting, bad dialouge and wasting your time then by all means watch this.
Dull, boring, talky horror flick with a disappointing score and just about all the action and scares confined to the end, but by then it is too late.
Some people might take offense upon seeing the fighting sequences involving the handicapped lead character, but then again, I don't suppose easily offended people are likely to put "Mr. No Legs" on their Christmas list.
There is no Ninja in the movie, except for a fight scene where masked people overpower Bolo, who then just asks them who they are, and they take the mask off!!!
She then proceeds to run to her room, turn up her music and cover her ears.
By the tacky polyester lounge suits, side-burned hair cuts and bell bottomed pants my guess on the year of production is 1978, and I can almost see the look of bewilderment that must have crossed the faces of the distribution execs who were shown the final product, which then lingered on the shelf until 1981 for whatever reason.
The plot revolves around a money hungry virus-vaccine producer who decides to make the virus first, put it airborne then make millions on the vaccine that he was ready to put out on the market because he knew their would be a need for it.
Conway ends up getting the virus and here is where the movie becomes down-right ridiculous and then turns even sillier at the end with former lovers bickering with each other in the after-life as the credits role.
The search leads him to world renowned virologist Dr. Ramsey Krago (Ron Perlman), who is secretly creating deadly viruses, releasing them, then "developing" an antidote (which he had created in tandem with the virus) and selling it to the highest paying pharmaceutical company.
For just like the act of gambling itself, or indeed, not unlike the Air Bud movies, Owning Mahowny seems enticing at first, that is, when you and your friends are just planning to see it, joking that you might strike big, that this might be the one movie that comes out of nowhere to surprise you, but then from the moment you enter the theatre, every time you give this movie a chance, it's just one bad hand after the other, until eventually you are completely numb to it, and you stop paying attention to your wife, and you start cutting out of work early, and you no longer enjoy anything again in life anymore because all you want is your Owning Mahowny.
In fact, they should have called it Blowing Mahowny, or Owning Baloney, or some reasonable facsimile--only then the ace detective on the trail of Mahowny would not be able to wittily observe that "Mahowny" spells "How many?"
And the story: It made no sense, bouncing like a pinball from here to there and then wrapping everything up in a nice, tidy package in the last 5 minutes as if DePalma said "Uhoh, running out of film, let's wrap this up!"
There are great movies, good movies, mediocre movies, bad movies, and then there's the Black Dahlia.
SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE THE DEAD GIRL, YOUR THE SICK ONE-- has got to be the funniest line that was not intended to be funny in the whole movie- I laughed, along with the rest of the theater, for about 2 minutes after that-- and then when the Voice Over comes on and its SCARElett's voice repeating it again, I just could not contain my laughter anymore!
They should have gotten an actor who is older then Josh- he did not fit the bill as a detective-- he looks too much like 2006, then a character from 1940's.
It was like the director thought the movie was too long so he just threw everything in at once to tie up loose ends, when all it does is create more questions then answers.
Will the Black Dahila murder be solved, will the good guys prevail, will Josh Hartnett learn to act, will the scenery hold up after Aaron Echardt's chews threw the movie- acting docile one moment, then out of control in the next-- find out when you see the Black Dahlia.... on video of course, after your friend buys it.
The Black Dahlia definitely could have been done so much better then it was, it was all just a jumbled mess.
I thought to myself "maybe it's just misunderstood to those unfamiliar with Ellroy's novel" But frankly, it just never felt right,,, and then it went more and more uncomfortably wrong; the actors in their roles, the soundtrack vs. certain scenes, the story fumbling it's way around with not enough mention of The Dahlia herself (which really drove the characters in the novel).
If your going to base a story on real events then there should be at least some similarities to the truth!
And then there's Fiona Shaw, who chews so much scenery that she must have been rushed to an oral surgeon to have the splinters removed.
They obviously didn't intend to make this a serious movie, but rather it was a cheap attempt to imitate a Film Noir sometimes, a TV mystery sometimes and then other times I don't think they knew what they actually wanted to do.
And then when psycho and bizarre doesn't work, she ends up going to meet his folks on Staten island.
It's as if the writers came up with that really great scene and then tried to find a totally bland hollywood movie to stick it in, where it vaguely makes sense.
This brought out every tired clichÃ© in the book and then slowly murdered them one by one.
Coach Roy then reluctantly agrees to coach a struggling junior high basketball team.
There's also the slapstick assistant coach (played by SNL cast member Horatio Sanz), who bumbles around hoping to provide supplemental humor when basketballs slip out of his grasp and fly in all directions; there's the overzealous opposing coach who thinks junior high school basketball is as important as college or NBA--but then again, can you really blame the guy?
While reasonably entertaining throughout, this is a sloppy, scrappy film that underwrites its characters, gives them some silly dialogue and then feeds them to the lions in a gory finale that's just like any other in the genre.
Had they kept their relationship purely professional, then the movie would have been slightly more palatable.
This is then interspersed with over the top acting and characters that it is hard to give any care for because of how cold they seem.
OK, right off the bat, the whole issue with the cover being so VERY misleading (there's no chainsaw, the population is a bit higher then depicted) has been said over and over so I won't repeat it here (oops just did).
...But then, I had to buy it because of my name in the credits.
We all had a blast making it and you get to see the back of my head as I walk with my "family" across the parking lot in the beginning and then again at the end (I'm the guy in the blue "medic" outfit.)
And then the guy says: "Would it be okay if I took a bath?"
And then she says "isn't your timing a little off?"
What I had trouble with was the fact that in the courtroom scene, Brosnan notices the criminal make eye contact with a suspicious-looking man, who then gets up and leaves.
And then later when they figure out that what the bomb is, and how it's detonated, they also figure out a very easy way to defuse it.
She then changes her name to Eileen; and, is left with a string of 'suitors' who become so numerous that even she has to regard herself as a prostitute.
If you think using burnt cork to make white actors "look black" is a hoot (and racist), then this film will leave you shaking your head and wanting to conjure up the ghost of Al Jolson real quick.
The film opens with the mummy character when he was young and vibrant - we see him with his love, get in a fight over a girl, and then watch his girl beheaded in front of him and then he is "paralyzed" and prepared for mummification.
)is wrestling with the mummy - we don't know why he wants to kill her - has the two fighting in front of a mirror and then shows the cameraman in the mirror shooting the scene.
It was a great book, then when was made into a movie, the story changed.
And then of course, the mean count has the Lugosi-like foreign accent and the local folk get involved with the voodie attempts on the admiral.
They then find a creepy mansion inhabited by Dr. Sangre (Henry Victor) and several zombie like creatures.
As for the movie itself, 65 years after it was made, and considering the social and political atmosphere of that day, it's hard to fault the writers or director for what was considered standard fare back then.
The movie opens with a young boy seeing his mother electrocuted to death and then cuts to a dog being put to sleep by lethal injection!
).If you're a gore-hound then you will be able to handle this little flick(there are better gorefests,though),but if you like scary horror movies avoid this trash like the plague.3 out of 10.
A little later in the vet, a bunch kitties were sent... blah... blah... blah... then the protagonist's friend came in with a Siberian Husky (Hey, I like that dog!).
The dog is then buried, a little later, freaky police officer turned into freakier police officer after being bit by a zombie dog... ooh... ah... scary... Not!
The rest is hogwash and the story lacks internal logic (for instance, Brown kills the town bully and then revives him, but why?).
Finaly a differend couple then Hanks and Ryan.
The movie has no point, constantly repeated scene stills and short carnival clips, extremely choppy, even worse then your average asylum movie.
It wasn't even scary, the first hour and a half was just a waste, then they tried to pile all of the "Scary stuff" into the last 5 minutes.
First of all if it was supposed to be a tribute to Tod Browning's Freaks then I would feel like I had been slapped in the face.
And then there's the ending.
It may have been carried by some reasonable acting, but if the word had been defined by the standard in this movie then I think actors would still be waiting tables as it bought in a higher salary.
So what then made this a horror?
They devise a plan where Lucy seduces Lan, gets him to propose to her & then kill him off leaving her to inherit all of his money so she & Lee can live happily ever after, simple eh?
If "C" movies exist then this would make the "D" category.
If your interested in seeing a low budget version of HBO's series Carnivale, then this is the one.
If your a horror fan and want to be completely ripped off by false advertising then go ahead and rent this one.
Still some good gags now and then.
Each time Fraser moves into a different character you hope that the film will fulfill it's potential and then just as you are getting into it we go back to Hurley which not only brings the film back to Earth but on it's way to Hell.
Even if I didn't new the series before seeing the movie, I wouldn't of give more then 4 out of 10 for this piece of ...  Everything is very predictable, nothing is really funny or new, nothing to push me to the limits.
Don't get me wrong, this movie had the potential, but then lost me somewhere in the middle.
he proceeds to inspire them for about two minutes as a teacher, and then he goes back to being a jerk.
By then, you may have become somebody."
As an example, for most of the film, he's a decent guy who likes his promoter and is infatuated with Barbara Stanwyck but then, in a matter or seconds, he casts them BOTH aside to join up with an obviously evil and slimy gangster as his NEW promoter!
This is especially odd, since up until then he never acted crazy or hot-headed (just the opposite in fact).
One of the better lines is Holden's response to Stanwyck's initial brush-off, "See you in 1960, maybe you'll be somebody by then!"
Alan Alda just ate it all up trying to be in denial what 'he had done' and then fall apart and then become defensive, but it was so flat, it was forgettable.
This became something of a staple in 1980s television at this time; become overwrought over the actions of someone else, then watch how it pains me and not them.
As the wagon thundered across the cowboy landscape, I began to chuckle, then laugh.
If you enjoy being cheated on and watching it happen to other people as well, then you'll probably love this movie.
By the time we were nearing the end i said "This title is completely irrelevant " then once you see the final scene it all makes sense.
And then everything reaches a point where it's so strange its unexplainable.
Realistically, how could these two hook up again, and then find their respective spouses going at it less than 20 feet away?
A politcally correct looking street gang (every race is accounted for), harass, and then rape Sandy.
You should be able to pick up the rest of the film, he teaches her and then they go after the gang.
it just doesn't get any better then this.
But then again, nothing else in this movie makes sense either, so who knows.
If you don't mind killing time and wasting your hard-earned money, then this may be the movie for you.
If they can't provide a reasonably accurate retelling of the story then they should change the names and call it by its right name-"fiction".
In Northfield,Younger strikes a nefarious bargain with Mr.Wilcox(Robert R.Harris),the bank's owner,who plans to inveigle the unsuspecting townsfolk to invest their savings - then fleece them,and disappear.
What we have, then, is shoddy "stars" that no one really wants to see, like Melanie Griffith, shoddy directing, that we could live without, like Banderas,' and shoddy films, that no one really wanted to see, playing three times a day on Bravo, like this one.
But then again, no one does "disasters" like Irwin Allen.
Even then, you will sleep, but your stomach's gonna churn with this garbage in it.
Unless the actors were all great friends with each other (which I know for a fact was not the case), then they had some serious issues to sort out.
If you've already guessed that a man goes down in this clap-trap contraption whilst a tremor occurs and the cable snaps and he falls into the lava below, then you are dead set correct.
It looked like a scene from "The Blob", but then I remembered that Steve McQueen wasn't in this garbage.
Dumb enough, but why  then fly DIRECTLY over the mouth of the volcano?
And then there's the lab at the lip of the volcano.
Go watch Alex's Apartment, Jack-O, Critters 3, The Howling 7 and then tell me how bad When The Screaming Stops Is.
Convincing Killikrates that his soul-mate has finally been reborn in the form of a stunning European blonde named Carol (Olinka Berova), power-hungry occultist Men-Hari (Derek Godfrey) strikes a deal with the lovelorn leader: if he can successfully lure Carol to the lost African city of Kuma (using his powerful black magic), then he must be granted permission to pass through the sacred blue flame that would bring him immortality (and give him a pop at taking over the world!).
If you've never seen this show, then congratulate yourself.
This show might have garnered more good will from long time game show fans at the beginning, but GSN teased them by airing a few weeks of the original "IGS" at 3:30 am est and then pulled it to substitute this new, hugely flawed version, which was rerun from its 11:30 pm est time slot.
Andie and Benjamin meet and fall in love and then the action happens.
From then on the story follows the journey of the Abberton brothers - Sunny, Koby and Jai - as they face court cases, gang violence and some massive waves.
Don't watch this film if you want lies between romance but if you would like to have a really good time, then this is the film.
What's the freakin' point of building up this entire premise of the super acrobats and then just throwing it away at the end?
If you've never seen an Indiana Jones movie, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Seven Years In Tibet, nor any other HK flick, then MAYBE this movie will entertain you.
But then the almost-entertaining movie (for a HK flik) just got taken over by people who received new computers for Christmas: it became 98% computer graphics overlayed with the actors swinging on ropes.
Corny, yes, but if martial arts films with lots of color and vistas of deserts and the holy city in Tibet stimulate you, then this film is worth your time.
Of course along with these families there is also a family with an out of work dad and his wife and step child, why they are on this top secret base is beyond me, I highly doubt a woman would be working in such a facility in the 50's but then what do I know I think this movie sucks and that means I am an idiot.
The wife is annoying, but then again I think this is just the way she acts as if you had seen her in the equally as bad "The Screaming Skull" you would realize she is basically playing the same role.
We have to assume that, for some reason, it departed and then returned again.
You know those movies that look and feel like someone took a pickup truck down to the Sunset Strip and rounded up a bunch of prostitutes and whores, gave them scripts, drugs and money, and then said: NOW ACT!
START>ALL PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIES>ACCESSABILTY>NARRATOR  Have you ever woke up on Christmas day when you was young and seen a present that was so nicely wrapped, with the best looking paper that you just couldn't wait to open it, then when you do you find that all you got was socks?
For one each level is just the same in that you kill everyone in an area and then move on to another, like all video games the enemies start of weak and then end up being Hard Ass's.
This gets very boring when you realize there its a trick to killing everyone which is, hide in the shade, tap the wall and make the enemy come to you and then wait for him to turn away so you can make your move.
For example if you get seen and then subsequently chased all you need to do is hide in the shade, you don't even need to worry about them if they see you go in there as they will just wait for a few seconds and then say "Well, I guess that it was nothing" HOW CAN IT BE NOTHING, I WAS JUST 5 SECONDS BEFORE PUNCHING YOU IN THE FACE!!!
One who has read and appreciated the book on all of its many levels will also miss its many memorable and important "minor" characters; its sensitive and sympathetic treatment of Buddhism and other non-Christian creeds; and will be left wondering whether it was the star, the writers, the producer, the director or some combination of the above who thought they could go Kipling one better by, among other things, replacing his almost-accidental crisis with a Flynn-caused avalanche, then neatly tying all his lifelike loose ends into a big Tinseltown bow.
He glances around, slyly opens the coffin an inch, and shouts in the last word of the ancient Moldavian conversation they'd had half an hour earlier, then slams the coffin shut and strides out with a look of satisfaction.
He was good in AIRPLANE and the first Frank Drebin film, but then he sold out: he started to use his 'talent' in trash like MR. MAGOO, RENT-A-KID and that stupid EXCORSIST spoof.
"History of the World Part I" also has its moments but parts are greater then the whole.
"Spaceballs" was made ten years later then it should have been.
I would also liked to have seen a lot more detail on where the location is based on this film, it would make it a lot more interesting if the back story on the location was elaborated on then you could get a feel for the where and the why.
Right then.
Well, there it is then.
If you managed to sit through it till then, you'll laugh away the stupid ending as well.
Anthony Hopkins is interesting as a primatologist who lived with gorillas for a couple of years and then was sent to prison for killing poachers.
The closest this movie gets to genuinely creepy is a part were a girl is talking about impaling while sharpening a long wooden stick...but then she cuts a guy's eye open and what looks like jello-o squeezes out and it's back to the laughs.
She falls dead at their feet.Cut to a shot of a kid witnessing it and then to a long shot of the two cult people with the dead Charlene at their feet.
I'm a sucker every time for Hollywood video's 4 for $20 sales, meaning I find two I really want and then have to find two that might not be TOO bad but I'm generally WRONG about that.
If I may point out some of the more questionable things: okay so if they were really worshipping "false gods/demons" then why did they actually end up having power at the end?
If you want a movie that will tap into every human emotion possible, and make you stand up and cheer at the end, then this is the movie for you.
When they came up with the title, if the filmmakers meant the seemingly endless stock of poor genre films that are being pumped out in the wake of digital film-making, then this is indeed "one of them".
We are then reassured by the writers - through text that constantly and randomly appears on the screen in the middle of conversations - that she will not die because this movie is sort of a comedy.
Of course back then there was no North Atlantic Treaty Organization and no American soldiers stationed in Europe.
They base the economy on twist-ties just for fun, and then divvy up some goods.
But then I still went ahead to watch, and i was wrong.
The movie is interesting only to the first half, then it begins unleashing the crappiest elements of a romantic comedy.
From then on, it's all very rushed and the characters of the main leads seem to change overnight(especially for the female lead).
Phillip also pushes Missy and Alex together and then acts as if he is jealous when they act on it.
If this was nominated for a screenwriting award by the WGA, a professional association of screenwriters, then it's time to hang up the word processor.
Obviously it was no one's dream to make this movie, but rather, this was concocted in a board room somewhere, then produced with cold efficiency.
He then decides to get back at the four shrinks who helped put him away.
And then there is Richard Dean Anderson.
Come get me when it's framed and hanging on the wall--then, I'll appreciate it.
I paid $20 to purchase it, along with parts 3 and 4 ($20 for each)) on a VCD, because I had been looking for them everywhere, then saw someone selling the VCD's on Amazon.com.
And the kid is whiny...but then, look at his parents.
The only enjoyment I got out of this movie was watching Dean Stockwell....I loved it when he was frying up eggs for breakfast, and then asked the dad if he would rather have granola..or (with great disdain) Yogurt!
If you are an Allen fan, then this one is worth seeing - an artist's bad work is nearly as important as his great work.
During the course of the film, we learn that Diane was once a well-known actress, and that many years ago Lane, then a teenager, was supposed to have shot dead Diane's abusive boyfriend.
But then it is an entirely forgettable movie.
Mia's ex-film-star mother and her physicist husband descend on them, insult everyone and then go away again.
Lee Marvin, dressed as a 1930's gangster, robs an armored car and shoots a bunch of cops and a pre-schooler, then lams it to the French countryside where he's captured by a repulsive bunch of inbred French rednecks.
The death scenes should contain at least a little violence and possibly some ketchup or another condiment of some kind -not just 'madman marz' casually strolling toward the victim and then a shot of their face releasing a few insipid yells.
It shows a furry-headed, heavy-browed Hyde running into a house which is then set ablaze by a pursuing mob.
In order to make young Jekyll look insane, Lanyon fakes those notes and swaps "Acrostyn" for another chemical, so that Jekyll Jr. turns hairy and fanged - then faints - in the movie's only transformation scene.
Starts off with some gratuitous nudity, then degenerates into a ludicrous action film.
In this case, the kids practice shooting for a couple hours, then are ready to do battle with an entire army.
The Commandante comes along, shoots the soldier, then has HIS way with her.
It had an ending scene that woke you up and say wow, this film is finally going some place, then the credits roll.
I think if they cut Brian's part and use Steven Bauer in his place and change the script and keep the Packards and lose the band and add a Johnny Otis sound alike band, then they got something.
But then they all start looking at CC and chanting, "Do the dance.
Sara and David take a full 3 seconds to tie off their belay lines and then "jump" into the abyss - hardly a method one would expect of prudent cavers.
And how many times can various actors be standing next to an exploding mortar shell, dynamite, and hand-grenades and just get tossed about thirty feet and then walk away without a scratch?
If you like movie history and lots of information of the behind-the scenes variety then I strongly recommend The Plan Nine Companion for you.
1st of all...the sailor returns from seas...goes to Timisoara to marry...get's drunk all the way there....get's drunk there...goes with his bride at the hospital...get's shot by the Communist forces...believed dead is transported to a crematory...lies like stupid and burns alive...STUPID (also very idiotic part where he dreams everything is OK and then we see him burning 5 min later ) bride and her friend - bride is very very stupid as her friends are...their roles r very poorly written and acted Comunist forces and patriotic people - OMG... they have like 300 men and they switch them around...no real drama... 1 other thing...where did they get the cat and the dog in the movie?
those have to be like the ugliest animals i have ever seen...if this is how the director sees this country then he should stop directing  btw...at the end of the movie ..the baby is born..is a boy.......We never find out why his mother abandons him...but 15 years later he's an "aurolac"...actually the leader of them..and in the end he get's trapped in the underground sewage(and will eventually die...i presume :D )  so....whatever u do...don't waste u'r time watching this piece of crap...  2/10 (it actually deserved 1...but i support the Romanian cinema :)
Elwood introduced himself, then told his "sort-of brother" that he was thinking of putting the band back together and asked if he'd like to join.
So, Elwood purchased the police cruiser then he and Buster go for a very slow cruise.
Just then, the Russians arrive and shoot up the club, then torch it.
But if you liked the first film and would like to see a jazzy update, then Blues Brothers 2000 is for you.
Heather tries to do her time, but then the strange stuff starts happening - one student disappears, another has an accident.
So years went by, not watching the show, not even missing it, but then one day I noticed on ABC Family that they were beginning to show the re-run's, so I figured I would watch the series again and give it another shot.
It is one watt above flat-lining for 60 of its 61 minutes and then actually shows (for the one thin minute, spread in milli-second blips across the hour) that there is real life talent being badly photographed.I just don't see the point of going to some trouble to actually make this film that could easily be energetic and actually funny and allow lethargy to be the main thing on view.
Have a ghastly look at SWING PARADE OF 1946 for genuine evidence of this: they just constructed this gigantic nightclub set then found an excuse to film actors and musicians running all over it.
then this movie is for you.
The Woods is a solid,eerily effective ghost story,it boasts very good acting,a decent plot and a good setting.there are some special effects, but not as much as you would expect,which is a refreshing change for this genre.this is not a slasher flick.the movie is very character driven,and so is very dramatic,and is a bit slow at times,but not enough to lose interest.the only weak spot is near the end of the movie,but i won't give it away.the movie relies more on suspense and psychological scares than gore,another positive.this is not the best movie of the genre,but it is certainly on of the better.for those who like a little gore in their movies,it may not be your cup of tea.but then again,this is a different type of movie which doesn't require gore to tell its story.all in all a good offering.
The film then shows the doll, which looks nothing like the missing woman.
The accomplice then grabs some shrub-shears and snips some hair off the dude's head while muttering the grammatically incorrect statement, "I am barber."
She screams, then ignores him.
She screams, then ignores him.
The accomplice then makes quacking (ala duck) noises from the ventilation grate (which measures 6 inches by 6 inches) in the bathroom.
She screams, then ignores him.
The girl then shakes her head in dismay, even though she wanted her brother to save her in the first place.
She gets surrounded by dolls and then turns into one.
The girl catches her dress on a tree, then slingshots backward on her ass.
The girl is then immediately seen running away from the accomplice in the forest, apparently unaffected by the serum.
when that is true then the movie can't be great =D=D=D (not to dis myself, but to be honest) stay away from this crap.
In the opening, a woman leaves a successful date to be hit on by a stranger, then abducted by men in a van who dismember her with piano wire.
A woman turns into wax in a lake and is then sculpted into a doll.
Unfortunately the same effect is re-cycled many times as he overpowers his victims, slam them repeatedly on the ground, cuts off one of their arms at the shoulder, and then beheads them.
Somebody recites a line loudly, and then pauses expectantly, as if waiting for a laugh track to be inserted.
The Basilisk stares at her for two seconds, then chomps her torso off.
Military grunts come in talking all big and bad about how they'll blow this thing to smithereens, then run like little girls after it starts ripping them to shreds.
Some examples: Stanwyck saying I only want to make you happy and hope all your socks have holes so i can darn them then all day.
The highlights would probably have to be the two thrilling scenes where a car pulls into a parking garage, the passengers climb out and then slowly walk away from it.
It is fascinating that studio heads were still giving her "leading roles" -- but then, once you hear the lines she had to say, you'll come to the conclusion that she must've owed somebody something, because this film is absolutely atrocious.
But then, so is everybody else.
While Davis was frequently characterized as appearing only in "woman's movies" (then how explain THE MAN WHO CAME TO DINNER or WATCH ON THE RHINE?)
In all the years since then there has been nothing that Jane Fonda Turner has done other than marry a rich man.
Reading sub-titles didn't help my enjoyment; but then again I don't speak or read German.
", cries one of the vaguely ethnic International Scientists, "We must soak it in a catalytic medium then subject it to radiation!"
They give out a really fake, bad scream with little facial expression, then make some witty remark.
it gets a three as there are two rather witty deaths, ones that i have not seen in any other film franchise, but even then they are not as spectacular as they could have been.
The humor up till then has been hit and miss at best but the last 15 minutes or so are pure gold.
If you enjoy cheesy movies, and are willing to sit through the first hour or so of not so good viewing, then check it out.
Sure, it's very beautiful to look at, but, if you've seen the trailer, then you've seen the movie!
If you like crazy off the wall stuff, then this is your film.
You know you got something pretty sick when one of the first scenes include a guy having sex with a goat and then killing it off.
I am not saying that the cast have to look attractive for the film to be any good, but if you are going to hype the characters to be godesses, then at least make them look half decent.
I mean, I can suspend disbelief for most movies, but villains who can fly simply by wearing a dress with big sleeves and a full skirt, people dodging bullets by flipping away from them, a full-speed car crash (including ejection from the crash) with only a couple of scrapes to show for it, and girls jump-kicking guys who mass twice what they do to project them 5 to 10 meters away and then landing in the exact same spot they jumped from is a little too much.
I'm really glad that he dropped out of the new "Superman" movie and let the supremely talented Bryan Singer direct, because if he had directed it then "Batman Begins" would have been the first and only great DC comics movie.
I'm sure some horny 14 year old may find that entertaining but if you're not horny, and 14 then you'll find it as pointless as everyone else did.
If you look up deplorable in the dictionary you'll see a picture of this movie  -If you have a party and you want to clear out the room then pop this movie in and surely everyone will leave your house so you can clean up, but if you're not having a party and want to clear the room then please by all means avoid this with all your might.
I only lasted through about half of the movie, then I just got too bored.
If you like good movies, then stay away from this one.
But if you like your movies extra cheesy with a high count of boobies, then this is the one.
And then they walk away and let it go.
And then the end isn't an all-out gorefest but is scary and definitely different.
The best I can say about J.Lo is she looked gorgeous...so much better then the slutty look she has today.
And then I read this: "There's nothing here that I believe would disturb a child..." Uh, sure.
Yes, yes, it was a different time back then and probably kids today are exposed to much worse day in and day out.
One thing that needed explanation was Vanessa Redgrave's British accent, at times, slipping through clear as day... maybe her character was born in England then moved to America at an early age and the two accents merged?
Not that I'm complaining but this film today really only has nostalgic value in that it does show how life, especially in California was back then.
If you're driven to pursue illegality, then chances are you're desperate, but do you have to be boneheaded about it, too?
You'd think once a powerful drug dealer felt even the least bit threatened by one narcotic agent working alone (he didn't even seem to be a cop with heavy connections and influence), then he would immediately send out his goons after this guy and family.
Mortified and broke baddies then deduce who was that masked man anyhow, go for the revenge, but end up getting their just desserts instead and the hero rides off in the sunset.
- but the lone screenwriter-director couldn't really figure out anything original to do with it, so he opted for the approach of the old B's, namely, just give it the most predictable, simplistic rendition from start to finish, then pad with extranea to stretch it to feature length as needed.
Yet this potentially moving and engaging stuff *is* just padding, stuck in between very occasional action scenes as long, loooonnnnnggg vignettes which are then either just left behind or just magically resolved: e.g., after 20 minutes of closeup on the oldest girl's first 48 hours of stages-of-grieving, we jumpcut to some action, and she is just next - and last - seen frolicking off on a tricycle at her new home, daddy's loss just no longer to be at issue, and the part just as suddenly becomes an 'extra'.
Nagging realistic questions, raised by the nagging "realistic" backdrop of the film and all the earlier nagging "realistic" tearjerker sequences - such as, how's our reallife cop going to avoid the statutory consequences of going over the edge, no matter how much one may sympathize with him - are then disposed of in a coda-quickie (maybe two minutes) with the Detective Chief simply *summarizing* the wrap-ups to his "one good cop".
The thrill is to see a fantastic plan take form and then see it pulled of, usually with some complications coming along the way.
But then it just went silly.
And were did the mafia go then, they just vanished from the plot.
When a film looks good today, you know it looked great then.
The best recommendation I could give: Skip the first hour, watch the minis do their stuff, then turn it off.
I hadn't seen Caine as bad as in this one before, but then again I haven't seen that many flicks with him in them.
Usually I first see the movie, then, the book it is based on, as not to get disappointed by the differences in it.
The movie The Power of One is a perfect example of how a producer can buy a story, lent it to a screenwriter who shreds it to pieces and then gives it to a director who mutilates it even more.
Hall is clearly less concerned about emoting a performance, but then again, she's been around for a while.
What I think is too bad is that the movie set itself up for interesting scenes, but then pulls back to the basic mid-range bed shots for the lovemaking.
Given the physical talents of the cast, it just seems to be a waste to go to all this trouble, then not do something more interesting with them than what turns up.
If you want a good laugh then see this movie!
Started out interesting but then the story got more and more ridiculous.
Two strangers arrive and then save some woman and her father.
The ending is a cinematic equivalent of "then he got hit by a bus".
I really didn't care about any of them by then.
I saw Magical Mystery Tour in college at a bar, where they put a pitcher of cheap draft in front of you and then started the 16mm projector.
Probably then, Klaatu just forgot the movie's name, and sends a command to freeze the whole Earth machinery pool.
Or do we look to director Scott Derrickson and the creative team for having culled together the shots and sequences for the film, and then not knowing how to make some sort of good movie out of it?
If they do not care, then why should we?
Secondly, the military would be in charge, and there would be much more collusion between department heads then led to believe.
They have no rapport, but then the child is so hostile, one can understand why.
When he shows the alien the memorial graveside of countless dead military men and women, and then visited the Abraham Lincoln memorial, you were profoundly moved.
There's no sense of impending disaster and when the day finally comes for the Earth to stand still, a swarm of badly executed CGI bugs destroy Yankee Stadium and then stop.
If you throw all those things together blend it up with a p1ss poor plot and about two cool CGI scenes (that are both in the commercial) then you have this movie.
First you think he is a "bad guy", but then he says that hes going to save the world so you think he is a "good guy", but then he kills someone so you think hes a "bad guy" again.
But then he revives him.
Klaatu is taken to makeshift hospital where we learn that he was walking in a 'placenta' suit one minute and then the next minute they are marveling about how he was 'just born'.
It grossed me out when he stuck his finger in the 'planceta' and then in the dead cop's mouth!
not as intricately paced as May but still a good film....i do have to correct IMDb on their error comment dealing with the lesley gore song mention....in the film, the dj clearly says, 'you first heard her at the ripe old age of 17 with the #1 hit, It's My party, Heres lesley gore' and then it goes into "you don't own me'.
the film is creepy as can be and if that doesn't scare you then maybe you really aren't into scary movies.
And then there's poor little Jaden Smith, who appears bored to tears throughout the film and is given no direction from Derrickson except when he is asked to cry on cue in the supposed emotional climax of the picture that left me feeling sorry for all involved.
Keanu/Klaatu emerges from a pretty orb, greets the pretty microbiologist, then gets shot.
The movie starts off well enough, and then tries miserably to develop the characters and make us care for them.
There were some very interesting ideas (the sphere-like ship, the nanobots, the Gort acronym) and the effects were top notch, however Gort (the one thing the movie had going for it) was on screen for less then 10 minutes.
They were discovered doing unsavory things and then what happened from there isn't clear but it seems they were dealt with nastily.
In some situations he is shown as extreme--using an alcohol wipe to open his own medicine cabinet door, for example--but then the next second he is touching people and objects willy-nilly and not appearing to be bothered at all.
If you enjoy these mondo films then there are plenty more better ones out there.
then that is fine.
To top it all, he then 'introduces' some 'great hollywood special effects' to compare for us, with what we have just seen.
Note that the 'great hollywood movie' is actually a film made by the same company which then leads me to the train of thought..
If you get a chance to see this...well... if you are a teenager..if its a sick evening and a bit of a party then I'm sure it would be fun.
If you enjoy these mondo films then there are plenty more better ones out there.
This is no more an accurate portrayal of the south then say "Forrest Gump".
The highlight of this film for me was seeing the leprechaun rip a dude's face to shreds and snap a guy's neck then ride a go-cart.
It was a DVD called Ultimate Boogeyman that I heard about this horror film and it's leading villain from, and then I heard a few other things about it, and decided to see if my predictions would be correct.
Ozzie tries to convince everyone of what he saw, but they obviously don't believe him, and then he and Alex spot a rainbow, and follow it knowing there should be a pot of gold at the end, which there is.
Actually, I thought it opens rather well, but then not too long it falls away quickly.
but michael wanted to be honest well there you go then.
Since then, he went on to direct the best episode of the Masters of Horror series, and this film...which has unfortunately remained in limbo for far too long.
Like when crying about a Christmas tree and then the cop wannabe STEALS one!
I rented the set with great hopes despite the box-art picture of a gent who looked almost completely unlike my mental picture of Roderick Alleyn, and then only with difficulty sat through two episodes.
But to set that up and then say -- "hey, we all need to slow down sometimes and smell the roses" is just plain bunk (not to mention clichÃ© sentimental crap).
!What kind of crap does MTV come up with?Sure, there's your every now and then GREAT show on MTV, but usually there's dumb excuses for entertainment like The Real World aired.
She then is kidnapped by two lovers and a Japanese man that listen in on her conversations and look through her window.
Eventually the police come looking for them and she is then caught and put into prison for two years.
He then is given a magic potion by a sorcerer to return in the past.
These two later scenes would have needed little or no change had the long and totally unnecessary introductory sequence not been included, and the film would then have opened logically by introducing its principal characters.
But then again you probably don't need to se this mess to understand that.
If you can sit through this movie without killing yourself or someone next to you who may have been involved in the selection process, then you are person who has a will of steel and should not be wasting his time watching movies but teaching some sort eastern Shinto religion.
I also couldn't get a feel for what time they were in, it seemed simi future based on the police garb, but then the cars and everything else seemed modern...Weird.
The film takes you to the famous Spaun ranch and shows pictures of then and now.
It didn't make sense then, and it does make sense now.
Credit is a tool, a very powerful and potentially very dangerous one, and if you don't know how to use it, or cannot use it correctly then DO NOT.
The producers want us to to feel sorry for these people who rack up debt, and then can't pay it.
If a corporation floats junk bonds and then declares bankruptcy, are we to feel sorry for those stock holders that lose everything when the bond holders insist on repayment?
And then, of course, we find out who the real crooks are, (besides the credit card companies).
For example, the movie claims that credit scores are meaningless but then goes on to "expose" a plan by the credit scorers to gather data from law enforcement agencies to feed into the credit scores.
), and then continuing spending what money you don't even have yet.
So if a store offers you a plan where you buy a TV interest free for six months, then you can just say, "So what if I have don't have the money now, I'll have it in six months.
If I buy the TV now, then I can enjoy the benefits of having the new TV and put off the costs of paying for it.
Nonetheless, without any insight into what actually contributes to consumer debt (which includes economic factors, like interest rates) then the movie degrades into an anti-big-business polemic of misplaced blame.
While I don't think that late fees should make up half (or more) of a consumer's credit card bill, I find it difficult empathizing with people that purchase something, then elect not to pay the bill.
She is the one who is responsible for her first dog's death as she allowed him to escape, and then she has the nerve to put the blame on her neighbor.
To those who thought this movie was "warm" or "funny" - if your idea of warm or funny is to watch a slightly introverted but otherwise competent woman sink inexorably into a downward spiral of psychotic madness replete with larceny, child abuse, animal abuse, vandalism, betrayal, and attempted murder - then this movie may be just your cup of tea.
This is truly a woman that has no life and then gets so obsessed she seems ready for a rubber room.
Valentine is then put to death.
After needed psych treatment Peggy feigns resurrection by first returning to her home and job (yes her employer actually takes her back) and then in a flash turns her back on all.
Potboiler like this, can be mocked up anyone, and then they collect money for tickets...
I was really disappointed with this, given a decent cast and a decent script and someone who can direct then it would have had the potential to be a good all round film.
I can't Begin to put into words how bad this is, its long, drawn out intro of the film and then a rushed ending really spoiled it and made it hard to watch as it became boring within the first 20mins.
If you have some time to waste then watch paint dry, its more entertaining than this film.
Killer Klowns is one of those movies that you really get if you lived in that era, and if you didn't then there really is no way to explain it to you.
After we get the model of a Klown skene established (Klown will show up, do something kind of clowny, and then kill someone) we get that repeated over and over again.
then he will start seeing other girls attractive and charming (and caring)!
then he will start flirting, and maybe kissing them, making Sam taste her own poison.
then will she accept his apology?
At the first sign of any problems she will look somewhere else then, when it all go wrong, she'll go back and the idiot Ben will take her back.
This movie tries for comedic moments -- they fail -- then goes for something dramatic, which skewers the tone.
If you like Eddie Izzard, then maybe it's worth watching.
And then, the famous car chase takes place, but unfortunately it is pretty short, a few minutes and very unsatisfying, because it is mild like the movie itself, but the editing is really astonishing, cool.
The story is not intricate, but the movie is so slow that one finds it difficult to follow... Bullitt gets off the taxi, taking all the due time; then he calmly walks toward the parking area; he opens the door of a car; after a while, he shuts the door of the car; he broods over something for another long while (there's no hurry!
But then, to make a number of idiocies just for the sake of disobeying the authorities, that was considered cool in the late 1960s (and also now, at least in the movies).
I don't think doing drugs all day long should be called that, sounds more like apathy to me) to appreciate it, then this is definitely not my cup of tea.
It also cuts HUGE chunks of the plot out, including several key characters and then adds ones that don't even exist to begin with!
But if you like horror movies, and zombies and gore, then check out this movie, I'm not got promise you'll like it because everybody's taste in movies in different, but all I know is I enjoyed it.
i first heard of the film years ago, lots of hype about it being a great little indie zombie film (i am a huge huge fan of the genre), then when i eventually got hold of a copy it was well packaged and the cover looked good......after the opening sentence i had already made up my mind that this film was complete and utter tripe but i still gave the movie a chance.
I try to go down to Selma every now and then and I always think about this beautiful story and film - and all of the wonderfully real characters... the story is so touching and melancholy.
And then there is the main "plot" which reduces zombies to side characters!
One character decapitates a zombie then puts his fingers in the heads mouth!
85 minutes long and it feels like three hours; the acting is truly awful Scott Spiegel turns up in a small role, ruins the scene and then years later directed From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money, easily one of the worst movies ever made.
i did like the gore however (there is plenty of it) and the violent effects are not that bad, so if you are a gore-hound then you might want to pick this movie up.
if you're not one for mediocre acting then i also don't recommend this movie.
Either women in '41 were much more stupid or forgiving than today, or somehow people then thought that lying was cute and funny.
Things are not that groovy, though, as the youngest members of society are left to fend for themselves and, within them, dissatisfaction begins to build and then the movie ends.
If you have ever paid to hear or see one of these people, or bought one of their books, then you have my deepest sympathy.
This movie was horrible, it made no sense, and then when things started to make a little sense it didn't make the plot any better.
Kyra made even less sense, as in the beautiful long haired acrobatic girl who can apparently take care of herself, then still needs Riddick to come save her at least three times in the movie.
And then the story itself.
It's the same ridiculous "twist" that Stephen Sommers used in "The Mummy Returns" with Brendan Fraser's character; it didn't work then and it sure doesn't work here, either.
If you haven't seen "Pitch Black", then you won't understand a good half of the movie anyway.
And even then, her character is still saddled with a name ("Aereon") that would go much better on a car.
If one can get past all of the shortcomings of this movie, then I suppose one could enjoy it.
Dracula then sends him out to catch beautiful girls for him to tie up, love up and drain dry.
Dracula gets these women naked and then insults them because they have small breasts or are too heavy or something.
Funny then porny.
In fact, if you see it on a shop shelf then RUN AWAY!
A pity Locke was never given roles this meaty since then.
Our bulletproof walk-through-walls baddie gets one of his sidekicks to blow up a school bus full of kids, then gets the police to follow the radio signal back to the happy clappy hide out with orders to kill everyone, while he waits about upstairs.
So first it confuses you and then it puts you off.
Made worse would be the father, sporting that Race Bannon voice, telling kids not to do something, then the kids, usually Haley's character, would do it anyway, chaos ensues, who did it, the kid would confess and we would get a stern parental lecture.
If you love teen comedies then give this a look, but it ain't no "Porky's", that's for sure!
If you like to see pimples, pores, a stray nose hair, and blemishes then you will be impressed by the graphics.
If you don't get it back then you will be a putz (they said it, not me).
And the barmaid's male lackey gets yelled at, scolded, called a putz, then kicked in the head.
I saw "Lonely Hunter" when it came out, and perhaps 2 or 3 times since then, and it has certainly stood the test of time.
On every show, Letterman shows the "great" speeches made by JFK and FDR and then all of a sudden shows Bush stumbling or saying something stupid during his speech.
Later, Oliver Hardy has one nice piece of volte-face acting when he barges into a room, all bombast and bluster, then he instantaneously morphs into a courtly gent (resembling the 'Ollie' of Hal Roach films yet to come) when he sees there's a lady in the room.
And when Coyote's young and lovely new wife Iris (Mia Maestro), initially resistant at first, vigorously seduces Nat and then hatches up a scheme to pilfer Coyote's "reward" money and escape, everything seems to be set.
Until then, "Deepwater" is a serious no-no.
This movie had the ability to allow me to feel what I was unable to as a child and only years later would I be able to understand the reason for the overwhelming sadness I felt then.
charles band is indeed the ed wood of our era..this movie was done and over in 65min.full moon is robbing us in the redbox for a buck.iam a true monster fan but this one was the worst of all of the full moon madness DVD .band's puppets are even better to watch then this guy wrap with toilet paper and turning people into stone.more time were spend on some kind of a lesbo scene,which was the best highlight of the movie.charles band should be banned from stealing other people's money.no plots,no acting,no screenplay,no gore,no f/x and band as the director was sleeping doing this piece of junk..ed woods is laughing from his grave..please don't make a part two..a junk is a junk and a movie is a movie..watch it for free instead.
As for the fight scenes - it's as if someone associated with this movie watched the action sequences from "Mannix" and "Star Trek" and took notes...but they then lost their notes and tried to reproduce every thing from memory five years later.
I can not say anything good about the movie then I am going to finish my comment
They say starts with headaches, then vomiting and then bleeding everywhere.
Well guess what, people just started choking and then dying, no vomit, and only occasional blood.
The dangerous ones are when you are contagious for a long time before showing symptoms and then you die.
And then imagine every cliched action movie moment (that is even vaguely appropriate for a submarine or even airplane).
A US fighter plane changes into a Swedish fighter and is then shot down by the terrorists in the sub using a missile designed to sink surface ships.
The US Navy then launches fighter aircraft who launch air-to-air missiles which miraculously turn into torpedos.
Dolph Lundgren does what he can with the very crappy material he is given here, however his chemistry with Meilani Paul is way off, and while he was likable, he just seemed to be going through the motions, however i still Love Lundgren , and he deserves better movies then this lousy crap!
The love interest role fell to a woman who looked like she would be more comfortable in a porn film, add to that:  1) Some very bad acting (mostly from big Dolph) 2) A totally rubbish villain 3) Offensive Russian accents 4) straight-to-TV plot 5) Some cheesy sex-related one-liners that are disgusting and offensive  then you have one really, really bad movie.
If a Heath Ledger/Orlando Bloom remake can only improve things, then you know the original is awful.
Postscript: if you loved "21 grams," then you're just the sort of pompous yuppie who goes for this sort of thing.
It shouldn't be surprising then that it glorifies war by subjugating and dehumanizing the enemies - in this case primarily Indians (Native Americans).
But then that's just me, I'm one of those kooks that hang around to read the credits.
It has all sorts of separate threads that never really come together, and although the film opens with a bang (car chase, shootout, multiple explosions), then it slows to a crawl as we spent too much time with Traci's relationship problems with her unfaithful long-time (also cop) boyfriend.
I hate when filmmakers can only make a plot move by adding someone for no real reason and then not even fleshing out the character.
I just had to get back from the screen really far before it looked right, then it was pretty cool.
Yes, I only gave it a 1 out of 10, but if you're voting on the Fabulously Awful Scale then it's really probably a 10 out of 10...I only caught the last 20 minutes on the Hallmark Channel today, but I could tell from just that short period of time that this one is a keeper for my Hilariously Hideous Films collection...Highlights: 1) the Egyptians costumes, 2) the bad make-up job on Moses, darkening his skin.
If that is the case, then the whole point of worship is a waste of time (if you don't even trust the Bible to convey the stories accurately).
Then Lisa Riley from Emmerdale did it for 5 years, then Jonathan Wilkes did it for a year, now Harry Hill does it, who I don't find paticulaly funny.
Why take the time to develop the Nanny,her realtionship to the kids, her romance and then once in America never heard or mentioned again.
All that film time and then there was no goodbye, no letters .
Why then?
And then they just disappear from the scenery as implausibly as they entered.
But then, I met a girl once who said she could dance to Pink Floyd'd music, so maybe...
Watching this film made me feel like I had just been to the finest restaurant in France only to find out that there is nothing to be served, but the chef then describes in great detail how good the food might have been.
Other filmmaker in the world is trying to get funding, then people get money to make sh... like this?
But then it stops making sense fairly quickly.
The yo-yo weapon is introduced early on, and then only teased at until the last reel.
Even then, it's not terribly exciting to watch in action.
Really not a good time for cinema to make a sexploitation comedy concerning pop music then!
But then in hindsight, I should have known better, simply just by *really* looking at the cast: Christian Bale and Natascha McElhone should have told me to expect a quasi-disaster, with Bale having appeared in a long string of terrible films (like REIGN OF FIRE, EQUILIBRIUM, etc) and McElhone having an almost identical number of crappy projects, like KILLING ME SOFTLY or REVELATIONS, or the half-baked SOLARIS remake.
100% predictable and devoid of anything interesting, including drama (the scene where Bale and Beckinsale scream at each other and then cry is laugh inducing).
But then how would the line "send up another bottle of Dom  Perignon" play.
This filmmaker is out to lunch ... therapy and then a good dose of reality.
That's fine (I guess) for what it is, but then there's no payoff unlike Scream and Wild Things.
If you're going to make a shallow, extremely predictable movie then at least give the audience some steamy or bloody scenes to work with.
If this was the perspective of the movie maker, then this movie is genius.
The film had me laughing throughout, like when the two main characters (who dress like oi punks, which added to my enjoyment) trash an establishment owned by a white bigot in the middle of the film for no reason (the scene seemed to be randomly thrown in), the ninjas at the end who turn into clumps of grass and either teleport or travel underground and then take their normal ninja shape again, the special team called in by the ninjas to fight the mafia (who are the protagonists) which includes an italian (i think?)
and who can forget the sex scene which contains no nudity, but then is immediately followed by a still shot on what appears to be a painting of our hero's girlfriend in the nude.
Dharmesh Darshan after melodramatic messes like BEWAFAA returns with AAP KE KHATIR a remake of A WEDDING DATE  The film also reminds of PYAAR TO HONA HI THA(FRENCH KISS remake) which was tad better  This film tries hard to look like a modern love story but falls flat The first half focuses on comedy scenes which are too in your face, the scenes between Akshaye and Priyanka too are awful especially their sudden love angle  The director suddenly forces the drama in second half and Punjabi stuff which is bad and the sudden Dino-Amisha angle is forced  Direction is bad Music is saving grace  Akshaye Khanna looks bored and though better then the rest yet he got typecast in such roles Priyanka overacts badly initially but is good towards the end Dino is okay, Suneil is horrible Amisha is bad Anupam and Lilette irritate and so the guju family
Curiously, it seemed to me that once the bullets started to fly, Pembroke lost more men than he started out with, but then again, I wasn't counting.
and then declares "I have a meat cleaver and I know how to use it!"
I didn't see the third story because I was falling asleep by then and turned the TV off.
Since then I tried hard to get any possible copy of it and now it is available on DVD... now, after 20 years, I think this is truly one of the silliest martial art flicks I've ever seen - and I've seen tons of them.
Erasmus then narrates three stories in order to explain the diversity of Monster species to his guest.
Many years ago this reviewer subscribed to fantasy-horror magazine 'Starburst', then in its infancy and rivalling 'Fangoria' for its lurid colour photos of blood, guts and exploding latex.
If you want to shill a movie, then at least have the decency to credit the members here with some degree of intelligence.
If anyone considers watching this junk then they deserve everything they get Including me.
Its not terrible, but then again its not terribly funny either.
The people this story described, is someone who also live a poor life even in China, they struggled here in China and then with nothing to give up, they went to USA for a so called American Dream.
If the book has the same tendency to self-promote at the expense of the truth, then the movie is true to the book.
And then neither are true to the facts.
Think of the worst Behind the Music special on VH1 and then remove any sort of information.
But that's what the United States Navy had available back then.
if you already know about Hector Lavoe, then this movie will just help you add slightly to what you already know.
But if you are a OH-YOU-SANG-TO-ME fan, then go watch it.
It took me till almost the end of the movie to figure out which kid went with which adult, but then I cared so little about any of the characters that I didn't really bother to try.
And then we have the promised minute, the 90th minute of the running time and you're waiting for those answers, as for the biggest one of them all, "What happened too the wife?"
The main character has a lot of episodes which are clearly delusions, but then there are many rational-looking scenes some of which are contradicted by other rational-looking scenes.
If you have insomnia and are wary about taking prescription medications, then this CLUNKER of film should do the trick!
I have no problem when a movie contains an ambiguous ending...BUT...when a director leaves the viewer without even THAT MUCH, the film then becomes a "so whats the point of the whole DAMN THING ANYWAY?
The acting is okay, the directing is okay, but there isnt enough of a STORY, other than, did he or didnt he?....and if thats all the director was going for...then again I ask...SO WHAT?
who CARES?.....and though I have no problems with sex scenes in a movie(as long as there is a reason for it) what was the point of this film to have a minor one....except to "just film a sex scene"...yeah, really original...If you like a story that goes ABSOLUTLEY NOWHERE, then CHASING SLEEP is for you....
And then nothing happens and frankly who cares if he killed his wife or not.
Another commenter in this section states that the lighting was authentic in that the Cornish locals at the time figured that as they had never been attacked before, there was no reason to assume that they ever would be attacked then or in the future.
He then answers the door with the joint still in his mouth.
Constantly starting new angles and then somehow trying to tie a story together out of these disjointed fragments does not make for entertainment.
The movie itself is suffering from mediocre acting, lack of extras and limited sets/locations - but knowing how the movie was filmed and that the budget was so limited (see trivia about the movie) then nonetheless a good effort - but not the director's best.
Of course, then the movie would have been 30 minutes long and had a simple happy ending.
And then the time traveler bursts in with his weird and inappropriate "STAY!!!!!"
To my surprise then, I found this to be a well-crafted and entertaining film.
Henry and Maria being caught by Fanny in the house, Fanny voluntarily kissing Henry and agreeing to marry him and then retracting.
Also true, it's filled with bad theatrical ideas, such as combining the heroine of the novel with Austen herself (and then casting the role with an actress who can play neither one).
But then Fanny turns up an album of atrocity pictures showing what her (almost) foster father, his son, and his crew were really getting up to with their slaves.
First, Rozema gives us a feisty, spirited Fanny Price, who tells off Aunt Norris and Sir Thomas, who accepts Henry Crawford's proposal, and then rejects it the next day (a la JA herself with Harris Bigg-Wither).
Here, we have Henry sending Fanny a display of fireworks and doves, and then we see her accepting his proposal and sealing the bargain with some less-than-chaste kisses - in public, no less!
If IMDb doesn't like these type of reviews- then maybe they shouldn't have this option available -after reading guidelines-.
So, what's the verdict, then?
i remember watching it when i was about 12 years old, and i didnt like it then.
If it was to make money, it's pretty obvious this didn't make anything, and if it was to tell a new fantastic story, then this is an even bigger failure.
At least then the Prince wouldn't be running about saving Snow White.
Spock, McCoy and everyone in the dozen science labs aboard the starship can't figure out a way to damage these alien suckers after hours of testing, despite being given a great clue by way of the sun; then Kirk idly latches on to a way at the last minute - maybe he was the only one being objective?
But if you prefer your films to be entertaining, thought provoking, humorous (not pretentious), well-written, and well made, then let Melvin go to dinner by himself, and rent a decent flick instead!  
Who then goes home and gets his mother to come back and save the men?
I got 45mins & 36 seconds into this movie and then decided i really didn't care, fast forwarded to the last 5 mins, and pleased for the credit to come.
For a good lesson watch this thing and then, the same evening, watch "Fail Safe" with Henry Fonda, a movie with a tiny budget but enormous acting and writing talents.
However, I actually wish that a less witty one had been selected, because then I might not have bothered with this silly little slasher flick.
Well, if this is supposed to be hope for the Swedish cinema, then Swedish cinema is pretty hopeless.
The Jean Claude Van Damme original was a symbol of the masculine late 80s action flick.I enjoyed it,but times were different when I saw it.The sequel is moreorless a repeat of that film,a carbon copy in fact,with Hong in the role of Shidoshi and Han in the role of Chong Li.Even the theme of Alex being a thief stealing a sword and then becoming a fighter who earns it honestly is taken from the original movie.There's even (near the end of the film!)
Bloodsport II opens like an Indianna Jones movie with Bernhardt whipping some asses and trying to make off with the sword, however it isn't until the prison sequence where we get the endless training and ponderous Asian philosophy, to then we get the endless stream of fight sequences.
But then again, why should they have put any effort into this cheesy train wreck of a romantic comedy: the plot is somewhat appealing in its naivetÃ© - four girlfriends return to their German hometown to mourn the death of their soccer-coach - but it's the kind of 'nice' idea that needs great dialogue, perfect execution, charming ambiance and romantic spirit to come to fruition.
SO, when THEIR spouses get together and build a friendship and then eventually sleep together, you have some sympathy for them.
If you're not, then there is no reason on earth why you should come anywhere near this movie.
When the baby arrived then got really funny although you didn't need any brains just sit back & laugh.
First half was good it really made me laugh & cry but in the second half when Vidia Balan came then got quite boring for some reason maybe because she spoiled it even Shah Rukh Khan's special appearance couldn't save it.
If you want mega budget demolitions scenes, a dramatic soundtrack, and award winning Oscar nominated acting, then rent titanic.
But if you want great R&B music, impossible stunts, and a whole load of great laughs (aided in no small way by the deadpan acting talents of Dan Ackroyd, John Goodman, Joe Morton and newcomer J.Evan Bonifant), then you can't do too much better than Blues Brothers 2000
Supposedly these three selfish stooges find a baby on the doorstep and then bicker relentlessly about having to look after the child... whining and slapping each other in-between pathetic songs.... and spitting hateful remarks at this tiny kid.
Then after they have reduced you to gasping in disbelief the script calls for them to abandon the kid in a storm, where the director then chooses to show us the horrifying sight of a baby wet and blue lying in a sodden basket.
These three idiots then decide they love this near dead wet baby and get her revived... so they can skip and romp around the landmarks of Sydney to our further head shaking bewilderment.
I'm not sure if it is worthwhile even then.
There were really unnecessary sentiment building scenes where these 3 jokers try to almost kill the kid and then turn in a new life just like that.
And then zombies come to town.
If this can truly be called a movie versus just a video that some idiots threw together, then yes.
Woody has left a bad taste in my mouth in the past with his ironic casting (hmm...Muriel Hemmingway as his ravishingly beautiful 17 year old lover in Manhattan...almost unbelievable until he goes and hooks up with Sun-Yee Previn, his beautiful, then 19 year-old, stepdaughter).
And then accidentally eat a lot more?
And Jane couldn't keep her mouth shut then either (yes, this really disturbed me).
She would just go around and talk to one person, then a random event will happen leading to another person and another event.
not even then with the addition of grade a cannabis did this movie get enjoyable.
but thats not the case, its just a stoner who gets high and then gets more high.
but even then they don't explain why that didn't work out or why shes such a loser.
Jane gets stoned, inadvertently gets more stoned when she steals (twice), then ends up in a crazy, random adventure that really was pointless in the end.
My problem is, it just goes to far with it and spends waaay to much time there, over a third of the film, about 40 minutes and then cleans it all up in less than 10.
The film then chronicles the romance between the fictional Tom and the real Cecilia and the complications which ensue.
Billy Madison was by far the funniest, and it's been downhill since then, with The Longest Yard being his worst comedy yet.
Despite Adam Sandler's best efforts to make it palatable, the overused jokes, the stereotyped characters that could have been easily replaced by cardboard cutouts, and the cheap humour do more then murder the movie, they bury it 60 feet under as well.
The movie started out alright, the concept was okay, but then it just began to get much much worse.
Unfortunately, they decided to throw in him dying, and then waking up.
If a viewer of the film can't see the aforementioned points, its then that the film might end up being looked upon as a one off fluffy piece.
As she then proceeds to twirl his hair in her hand.
Look, if you're a closet homosexual, which of coarse is okay by all means, and you want to stay in that nice safe closet and never let on but you need some cinematic accompaniment to your release then Brotherhood IV is the movie for you.
If you want to watch a good old fashion scary movie, then my friend stay away and save yourself the confusing life shattering erections, I mean plot horrible plot.
It is painfully long, and the only reason I kept watching is because I was waiting for this guy to die, but after legitimately being killed off 5 times: he's poisoned (all of his men die from this poison may I add) yet somehow he has enough energy to walk back through the desert (dehydration), fly a plane, which is later shot down and crashes (miraculously he doesn't get shot/survives the crash), then somehow through all that carries his wife through the desert to safety (she was dying of dehydration/maybe a gunshot at this point) and when she is safe he finally dies, but by then the movie was basically over.
The movie is just not even what I'd charitably call a 'B' movie... it is tortuously drawn out... not well written, not Hollywood-made (and if you value 'indies' above Hollywood, then this is still even below Hollywood-made)... simply sub-par.
At one point a guy is poisoned and shot but still kills a fort full of men and then carries a girl across the desert without water.
Before getting to the end, you want to kill the sappy main characters and then kill yourself just to end the misery!!
If you know the history, you'll know that Berendt wrote the book initially as a travel guide, wound up getting to know the Savannah natives, then, oops--one of them is indicted for murder.
Having sidestepped the major point of the book -- the gentle weirdness of the characters -- to focus on the trial, the film then tries to make a gay story seem as straight as possible.
He is first bemused by a man walking an invisible dog -- when in the streets of his character's alleged hometown, people hold conversations with entire invisible people daily -- by the guy in the diner (pretty "fly" for a white guy), and then by the concept that a zillionaire, especially in the South, would keep loaded weapons in the house.
who seek to "normalize" homosexuality (call me crazy, but I don't think Spacey's character is ever intended to be seen as the most normal guy on the planet), and then rants on in the next paragraph about how the movie lacks "climax," and therefore he's "frustrated" and "unfulfilled."
This film and RADIO DAYS were big hits, so I am pleased to say I did my bit as a cinema owner then to help this happen.
...and then we wonder how on Earth something like the Columbine High School Massacre could happen?
Rent the original, if you've never seen it, then staple on a hurl handbag to watch this chewy-as-gravel, poke in the eye.
Gale Sondergaard was good, but then she was playing her usual villainous role.
If you like to see a better (and typical) french movie then choose "La vie est une chanson".
This film appears to be satirizing Hollywood and if you can laugh at that, then you're very appreciative of good subjective comedy.
The plot for both is the same: Demented psychopathic retard working at a gas station uses the opportunity and in some cases house keys left behind by his female customers to rape, torture, and then murder them.
If that's the best they can do for a demographic then they have missed the point of low budget cult horror with an erotic tinge: There are SO many clever, interesting and sick, demented little horror movies out there waiting to be discovered that there is no excuse for making this available aside from sheer greed.
Then we see him making his move towards the victim and them the movie switches to a different scene and then later on in the movie like when we see the killer watching TV or drinking a beer or scratching his rabbit which is his only friend we see flashbacks of what happened between the killer and the unfortunate victim which we should have seen while he was killing the victim.
She can make great films with incredible comic timing (example: her great work in Christopher Guest's films) and then barely make a dent with crappy roles in crappy films like "The Oh in Ohio".
Admittedly, I did laugh, and if that was the film's only purpose, then it was reasonably successful in achieving it.
Instead, the motivations of the characters were initially presented and then left unexplored.
I am still wondering why the husband left so abruptly, and then why Priscilla didn't give it a second shot.
Second: he lets the son of the guy he just killed follow him around, then eventually gives him a job and home.Finally Jody accepts Santee as his own father(OMG!
The whole development of this plot is little more than "I can't let the good guys destroy the monster, because then the aliens won't come down.
A big ugly creature with a propensity for smashing helicopters goes on a rampage, and then winds up in a city somewhere.
In the first and most memorable scene in this movie, 'Jackson', while wearing a hockey mask and meandering around the streets of London one night, and grabs a guy from behind and peels back the flesh from his face and then punches a hole into the guy's chest and then rips out his heart.
Sit him in a corner or in another room, with a gun to his head and then give him food.
Fonda (aside from his hideous acting) takes a .44 slug to the gut and rides out of it, then he rides out the next day without bleeding to death?
They would wait, then surprise the camp (who was trespassing on their sacred land), and use arrows and knives.
A stack of TNT is tossed in the air, then easily blown up by lead bits from shotgun, thereby causing extensive damage to a very secure "open" drilled tunnel that is very sound.
The last scene, which is badly edited (notice people walking about during gun battle, then gone in next scene, snow on ground in a drought season, etc), was absurd.
A one legged man with a shotgun outruns everyone (thanks to shaky camera), then stops in the open to unfasten the train door and gets shot in the back?
And then along the way there's some mention of the Bible, some Bible verses, and then some sort of cross or crucifix on Ben's gun handle.
From then on, all I see are its flaws.
It's a movie, but boy, that guy Dan Evans with the wooden leg can motor.And PLEASE, someone tell me how the amulet or lucky charm engraved in the gun handle or carried by Dan empowers them all to mystically pause then, as Dr. Laura would say, "Now go do the right thing!"
If this is the best the studios can do with Westerns then they should forget about making them.
Whether it be the above examples, or Peter Fonda being shot in the stomach, at close range, having the bullet removed, and then immediately riding out into the desert on horseback as though nothing had ever happened to him, much of this film is just plain ludicrous!
If you have nothing to do on a late Sunday night, then give this one a try!
Yes, if you like gun fire and explosions then this may well be blissful viewing but for those requisite of a bit more substance to their viewing this will prove a decidedly tedious watch.
It is hard to imagine how this movie could be made and then released onto humanity.
If not, then don't waste your money.
It was then my brother said "Turn it off!
The only thing that could make this movie worse would be if Paris Hilton would show up and try to be dramatic and then she would be consoled by Wanda Cykes wearing a thong and looking for a Brazillian wax.
Trying to forget her troubles Cecilia spends her free time going to the neighborhood movie house, like millions of Americans did back then in the 1930's, to get lost in a dream of better times that are projected on the great sliver screen.
Cecilia's eyes fill up with tears and then when she realizes that her romance with Tom was a dream but by being a dream, as short as it was,it will never be forgotten and will always be with her forever like the movies that she loves so much.
Flat, forgettable parody of "Alien" about small spaceship crew who land on newly discovered planet, bring back a tiny blob of grape jelly that mutates into a one-eyed, humanoid grape jelly thing that sings "I want to eat your face" and then proceeds to show the crew that he means what he sings.
But, then again, even "Howard the Duck" got made.
If this was cut up and then shown on Sat.
Mornings then it'd be above average, just.
The central tale concerns a small fish who lost his parents (awwwwww) and then meets a lovely girl at the reef, only to have her proposed to by a big, bad shark and then he realises that he has a month to get trained up and ready to challenge that shark, for better or worse.
Firstly, let me start by saying that if I could give this movie 0, then I happily would, as it goes I cain't so a 1 will have to do.
Now, then on with the review.
She goes to see the movie of the title several times and then at one show, the main character in the movie (played by Jeff Daniels)speaks to Celia directly from the screen saying, "You must really love this movie, don't you?"
The character then walks off the screen and into Celia's life, claiming that he loves her and wants to be with her forever.
However, if you are looking to torture yourself and/or others, then check this movie out...it's something that you'll never forget, though more than likely you'll wish you could.
There is a stab at period costume here and there, but then Rigg shows up in suede go-go boots (not to mention Queen Hippolyta in a leather dress and thigh boots).
This movie does a good job of portraying a 1930s Kansas City of mobsters, racial unrest, petty criminals and jazz, and if all it took to make a good movie was atmosphere then this would be a great film.
When I thought of it upon waking up this morning with my review gelling in my head (I usually watch films at night then think about them while I head off to sleep--reviews often pop up almost fully formed when I awake), I burst out laughing remembering the character.
Great tracking shot in the opening, fine premise set up with the film's first (and principal) villain, then the scene cuts to Joseph Cotten, Edward Sloan, and Ruth Warrick, and suddenly it is like the driest stage play one can imagine.
For PURPLE ROSE, he swipes Buster Keaton's gimmick in SHERLOCK, JR., then lets his imagination run free as he did in the best of his NEW YORKER stories.
I'm sorry... the first predator dies instantly to an alien... the 2nd puts about about a 20 second fight before dying to another alien... then after that awe inspiring 21 seconds of alien vs predator action, it goes back to the humans being lost and stupid again for an additional 20 minutes... then you are rewarded with another 20 seconds, where it shows the remaining predator kill an alien... but its not the uber fight you think its going to be... it takes all of .5 seconds for him to slice through the head with ninja like reflexes... im glad at least one of the predators wasn't a total weakling right?????
They showed no curiosity, and immediately drew weapons, then were easily facehugged, and quickly spawned aliens, faster than in any earlier Alien film, literally within minutes of being impregnated there was an embryo bursting from the victims chest...which begs the question, why the hell would you bring weapons to a remote location in Antarctica, and not bring exploration or excavation equipment of any kind?
One gets killed, and then the remaining two manage to escape when an Alien tackles the Predator.
At first I thought I was insane and then I saw that this was an actual move.
I mean, crapping in your pants and then eating dish-water and throw up is better than this movie, it seriously gives Alien and Predator bad names.
They made the aliens here pretty bad-ass, more bad-ass then normal.
He raises expectations, gets you excited, pulls out all of his best tricks... and then somewhere around 30 minutes in, it turns to garbage.
And then it cut to a high tech lab, and then out to the desert, and then out to some glacier.
This was gonna be great...  And then, it started to suck.
And then, our heroes venture inside this ancient edifice and are trapped inside the pyramid because they decided to take some Predator guns.
And then the protagonist becomes best friends with a Predator and they go off to hunt Aliens together like Butch and Sundance.
And then I remembered that I felt the same way about Resident Evil.
Maybe he makes movies that begin and end really well, and then fills them with processed meat.
If I ever choose to see another one of his movies, I'm going to walk out after twenty minutes, go get something to eat, and then come back for the last ten and see how I feel about it.
The rest of the actors are of course bad and you have a better chance of laughing then being scared.
i therefore deduce that the woman is in fact a terminator, sent back in time for a completely irrelevant mission....at least my explanation makes more sense then the movie!
This movie is the perfect epitome of Hollywood taking something beloved, running it straight to hell (Predator 2, Alien 4) and then taking it even one step further by completely disjointing the stories and continuity, *ahem* alienating the fans and basically wasting everyone's time while marring the original (Caddyshack 2 anyone??)
When I heard Anderson was in charge of this project, I knew that it couldn't be good newsÂ.and then when the PG-13 rating came along, my fears were multiplied and confirmed.
Why in the hell would you claim to be a fan of both franchises and then go against many things we know about both creatures and make yourself look like a fool?
And after a short while the characters become boring and un-interesting and then u begin to long for either an Alien or a Predator to show up and start killing people.
If your characters are paper thin then the audience aren't going to care about them and then they quickly become bored.
If they had of just shifted the F word to the ugly mother part then there could have been just as many F words yet still kept the trademark line!
If you are Italian and old enough to have lived there in the 70s/80s, then you will probably get the point of this movie: Moretti's conflictual relationship with the (then) Italian Communist Party.
If none of the above applies, then pick another film.
I can't empathize with someone who falls for a man who spent 18 years in the joint running a prison gang and is then surprised when he turns out to be a user and fake and not a social reformer.
After hearing for more then 2 hours of Quran suras, because one of my neighbors had to play it very loud, i looked forward to this BUCK movie.
Pictures of all three lead couples, getting married, getting pregnant, and then posing with their babies.
Stewart Granger, which inspires her to go riding in Pony Carts singing traditional numbers then pushed by the radio and composing the Cornish Rhapsody, in which she entombs the sound of sea gulls and breaking waves.
The movie would have us believe that someone could get away with betting that a shot could be made on a player's turn and then being able to take the next shot because the player bought his opponent's turn and therefore the subsequent shot was still his.
Since the guy is the 13th ranked player in the US he obviously doesn't crack under pressure because if he did then he obviously would be unable to make his living playing pool for high stakes.
After enjoying the freshness of the original Pusher, then Bleeder was alright film overall; although it was hailed as a big advertising flop here in Denmark.
And then maybe when I'm even older and I've lived long enough -- this crowd will be watching this on TV Land and saying the same thing when another program by another youngster that is just the same comes out.
The condescending forwardness with which Sydney conducts herself is a miscalculated attempt to portray her an independent strong woman which backfires because we are all aware that such conduct wouldn't fly with any credible organisation let alone a government agency like the CIA , please,   3)Agent Vaughn's wooden acting, no doubt Vaughn is a cute guy but his face seems incapable of rendering an emotionally rooted performance   In conclusion i feel obliged to recommend to anyone who's planning on catching this show on DVD or tivo DON'T or you CAN'T but if you insist let someone who's watched season season 1 - 3 tell you what happens then watch season 4 & 5
The two first series are great, the third one is not too bad (fortunately, Melissa George was here), but then it got really bad.
They spend all but the last 3 minutes of the film trying so desperately to make you believe that this is a documentary and not just awful camera work and bad acting and then they throw that out the window with the "big twist".
"The Last Broadcast" fails miserably as a film not because of its low budget, or cheesy production values, or less-than-stellar performances (all of which exist); rather, the movie creates its universe, then, for the finale, decides to disregard everything that it has presented, in an attempt to be 'surprising,' or 'crass' or 'hip.'
I'm sure the filmmakers wanted the perspective to be switched to "outside observer" instead of seeing events through the narrator's documentary lens, but then, shouldn't they have used a still shot or at least a mounted camera to avoid the viewer thinking that someone else is hand-holding the camera?
It seems that the filmmakers felt, in spite of the bad critical reception of the first Blue Lagoon, that an exotic island and two teenagers discovering sex and then fornicating (though we see none of that) was enough to create an entertaining film.
The story centers on a young man from... yep, Orange County, California, who spends his careless youth surfing and partying; then reads a book that "changes his life" and, along with a dream to become a writer, really wants to attend Stanford University to meet the book's author who works there.
When Norma Desmond said "we had faces then" in Sunset Boulevard (and yes I know it was Gloria Swanson), Betty Compson was at the top of the list.
Kidulthood has a good first ten minutes, but after that the film falls a part and is no more then a 2 out of 5 star film.
Trife Â a black boy - then 'stands up' for Katie by declaring that he had sex with her Â thereby clearing her of her 'crime'.
When we watch "Night Shift" then no, it is not believable for these types of lunacies to carry on in the night shift of a city morgue.
Now, believe me, if I didn't see it then, I would NOT have bothered watching it ten years later, but because of the wonderful memories, I decided to do so.
I may look like a fool watching "Turbo" at my age and then writing a long, negative review (after all, it is a kids' movie), but like I said, it wouldn't have happened if I hadn't seen it at a much earlier age.
It looks like the TV show the effects which for a movie of this supposed magnitude should have rocked the house with the then new improved CGI instead looked like LASER FLOYD anyone remember that one neither do I.
I also give it a four because out goes Rocky Jason's replacement and the most annoying of the original MMMPR and then Blue Zeo Ranger YES!!!!!
Says one of them,then they're chanting "Hamlet" over & over.
When Andy is the first to get shot and then the FBI shooting up Cain and "Hamlet's" get away bus in a scene somewhat similar to the ending of Clint Eastwood's,"The Gauntlet".
Dean Cain and "Hamelt" then have one bullet each in their guns after the bus crashes and their all shot up.
These are people who looked at the superficial exterior and then stopped there, failing to see the true brilliance of the satire and the other fascinating qualities it had to offer.
They then assume that all the sand is dry, even though it is wet just below the surface.
The way shakespeare wrote was far from the way people talked back then.
And Geroge Raft-first he's sort of a good guy gangster, then he turns completely cold-blooded brushing off the death of a completely innocent 21year old woman by his partner, then he turns to be a good-guy again because the writers could'nt think of anything else.
It is as if the producer/director lost some pages of a much bigger and better script and then ran out of film, money and maybe even time to finish the story.
This film starts well and then descends into a swamp of nihilism and sour, unrepentant, dramatic manipulation.
the last 1/4 had what looked like the start of a promising thriller in it, but then it all just fell apart.
If this film was really a good film then how come this film was left behind by Major Distributors?
If you have never seen the original, then please do so because you will definitely appreciate how well the original was as opposed to this crap made by Scorsese.
That being said, if you have never seen Internal Affairs, then you will like this movie.
But if you are like myself and some others who have seen it and have seen this movie as well, then you will be disappointed.
Only the writing remained consistently good but even then it followed too closely the layout of Internal Affairs which is just plain lazy.
I don't want to vote for this movie but I find it very low from the Americans to remake an Asian movie and to get (or will get)a bigger success then the original movie.I want to criticize the American movie industry because they are not original.
It is better to search for original ideas then to play the role of the copycat in our society.
Most of the characters get shot within the last few minutes, and then the screen says "The End."
He wasn't talented, he was brilliant -- but that was then.
It's intriguing for a while, then downhill races into one of the worst supposedly classy films EVER MADE.
Consider Olivier in Marathon Man, how his characterisation of an ageing Nazi suggested all sorts of undercurrents of twisted psychotic nastiness -- and then look at Nicholson's leering, over-the-top gurning.
All these subplots should be omitted, then maybe the director can concentrate on the real story.
First Costigan is shot (Which is a ripped off from the original), and then everyone else gets shot in the head except Sullivan.
And then Dignam kills Sullivan.
And then there is this, the annoyance!
For a man to change sex, face a mirror for the benefit of the audience (look, breasts and no penis) and then declare that she felt no different but only looked different, is the biggest insult ever leveled at women in the history of storytelling.
But then again, it's probably one of those 'intellectual masterpieces' I am just too ignorant to understand.
He is given an then ambassador post in the East, forms a friendship with the ruler and gives them weapons to fight of a mutual enemy.
But then I felt there was a lot of emotional depth missing from this film.
It is not worth the time, unless you are a fan of Virginia Woolf's writing or interested in feminist movies, but even then there has been better.
Orlando, written and directed by Sally Potter, explores this theme, but then also weaves another few strands along the way.
To be honest, if I hadn't read that synopsis I wouldn't have had a clue what the story was supposed to be about - even then I didn't think it was about self discovery as the synopsis claimed.
The only realistic moment in this whole scenario was when the French agree to capitulate to the ETs, and then that was made into a joke by having the US react to that with surprise.
For example, it makes fun of an elderly homeless man, then offers up as comedy a picture of that man peeing on himself.
Not fun at all, you kinda wait now here comes the joke, and then there just comes nothing.
There were moments in this film that resembled French farce, then turned immediately into Greek tragedy!
Everything then seems to go off with clockwork precision.
If it's the only thing left on the shelf then it passes 2 hours, otherwise grab something else to spend your time with.
I hoped at least for a generous amount of Sinatra singing but even that was 1) strictly rationed and 2) performed by a Sinatra imitator and then, to add insult to injury, the end credits roll over Elvis Presley's Tutti Frutti.
However Federal Agents step in & forbid the killing of any Graboids due to the endangered species act which gives them the opportunity to become Shriekers & then after that stage they transform into yet another different type of creature which Burt has to deal with...
The script follows Tremors II: Aftershocks quite closely with the initial Graboid reappearance & then about half way through just as in Tremors II: Aftershocks a new different type of creature is revealed & I don't quite know what to make of them to be honest.
And I have to say, I laughed just as hard as I did back then.
He leads his rich, fancy family to the hotel, then abandons his two chaotic children to spend New Year's Eve with his lovely wife.
But if it turns out that a whole heap of the photos are of their kids naked in the bath, then it can become plain weird and uncomfortable, and you start wondering why the person showing them to you doesn't realise it.
If you have not seen Naked Gun 1 or 2 than I recommend those instead...if you have, then there is no point of seeing this one.
It's OK to laugh at these sort of 'simple, stupid', comedies every now and then, even if it has Leslie Nielsen in it.
So no matter how bad this movie actually is, it's still a movie that can and most likely will make you laugh, with also some cameo's from people such as non other then Ray Charles and Hulk Hogan.
But then you remember what really happened.
I also have to mention the ending which is one of the worst endings to a film I've ever seen, basically Laura is trapped in the house with the mad sisters & looks out the window as a angry mob of villagers approach & then it just finishes as if they ran out of film or someone forgot to include the last reel!
If "It Happened at Nightmare Inn" is only 67 minutes long, then that means that "Legacy of Blood" is close to 2 hours and 30 minutes (which in fact is not the case) Regardless, please do not waste your money or rental dollars on this version released under the title of a "Blood Soaked Cinema" release called "Back to the Grave" With the running time only being 67 minutes, then this must be the television version that played in a 90 minute time slot.
Just not enough to raise it above a slightly below average slasher film.It IS however better then the first film in the franchise.
The script by Catherine Cyran is drawn out, it has the usual cardboard character's that could have come straight out of any other slasher film, it has no reasonable explanation behind the killers motives, it gives the killer identity away far too early & then it's just a boring precession until the end & to add insult to injury it has a fairly low body count.
For some reason, the killer dons a mask to kill the first couple, but then shuns it to kill most.
I would only watch this movie with friends for laughs, other then that avoid at all costs.
The inane female characters in this film hit the main villain not one, not two, not three, but four separate times (that I could count) in the head, then would leave the area to have him recover and go on his killing spree again within a matter of seconds.
Casting is below-par but, at least, Arthur Shields (who also appears in a silly book-end in full monster make-up - but, then, as Gloria Talbott's legal guardian spends the rest of the film trying to convince her that she is the werewolf!!)
It's a science fiction movie then?
If you love Michael Keaton in early 80s comedy, then Night Shift is definitely recommended for you.
And then follows a disaster of a disaster film.
ten times stronger than the strongest earthquake; it's more like a million times stronger, 3) It's impossible to redirect a meteor when it's only days away from impact (again, nit-picking, or maybe they didn't know that then - though I doubt that), 4) it isn't possible to destroy a meteor that big (and that fast) with a series of nuclear hits, 5) One of the space centers only discover a big one going towards NY when it's just minutes away from impact!
', and then in a flash I understood the theory of relativity.
The thing that made it so revolting was the scenes with Jaws and finding that girl and the premise that he goes from trying to kill Bond and then becomes his friend was so bad.
I say 'mini' because we know little to nothing about them and then they are gone.
What about the crazy plane that was pretty much crashing, barely feet from the ground, and then we don't see it till the disaster is averted and it lands safely some 20 minutes later?
invite Guests onto your show and then cut off their Microphones when they voice an opinion that is different to your own.
If everyone would watch this movie, take a second to think about what they feel, and then take out of it the message that rings true to them, this movie will have had the effect a journalistic piece should have, even though I doubt that is the effect it was aiming at.
Because if it was ONLY about the message, then write an editorial in a major newspaper.
I mean people didn't call the plague "the plague" back then.
The era and the plague don't come in to it at all other than excuses to make the ridiculous script lines excusable on the basis of something like "it's set centuries ago, people talked crazily back then".
The main character, a private investigator, somehow is allowed to accompany police officers on a night-time raid of a dark farmhouse that reeks of death... then assumes the role of hostage negotiator while there is a half dozen armed police officers standing right behind him.
If you must see this film, just fast forward the 1st 55 minutes and start from there and even then you may feel very disastified.
If it had setup characters we could care for in more believable situations, then perhaps I would have felt that Stephen's adventures with the underground community of redneck judges would actually mean something.
It begins intriguingly, like a half-breed of 'The Parallax View' and early Grisham - a high-suspense legal thriller that hits the audience with a gripping, involving problem: a young judge (Douglas) is so faithful to the law that he sends a number of sociopaths free on legal technicalities, and then feels overwhelming guilt when innocent citizens are murdered by the scum he released.
It goes out of its way to convince the audience that an "illegal" problem introduced to solve its early dilemma -- (a secret society of dissatisfied judges who murder the scuzzbags who have been let loose) is justifiable and laudable, then it doubles back and spends the rest of the movie contradicting itself, trying to prove that such a solution is morally repugnant.
If you see yourself as an idiot, then go to Blockbuster and wow yourself with a film that could be shot in the 60s.
Movies like this put some basic elements together, and then count on the magnetism of the stars to enlist the audience's attention.
When he later says he is going to kill everyone I really thought it would be Fiennes, Mol, then the director, the screenplay writer (same guy, maybe), the cameraman before turning it on himself.
However, then it starts to get VERY strange.
Events run from the battle of the Alamo thru Indian wars to the Civil War and then gets to womens suffrage.
Most historians agree that the "taming" of the west occurred when women began arriving in greater numbers--before then, men of the region spent the majority of their time getting drunk and killing each other and the Indians--and someday that would make a really good movie.
if you want to check out Uma's amazing body (which is the ONLY reason i rented it) then go ahead.
Delight in the asking of these questions, then delight in answering , some of them, one of them....none of them.
to distract them, but up until then the film consists of awkward dialogue, inane action (Gigantic teddy bears, anyone?
Until then, this film should gain cult status before it makes it's way to video.
I've watched it 2 or 3 times since then and my opinion of it has improved, well, very slightly at any rate.
It was then rushed out of theaters with the bad-film strategy that relative obscurity would result in more bread at the video stores.
If this film is anything to judge her by, then I would describe her as arrogant, stupid, self-delusional, self-obsessed, narcissistic, shallow, and slightly insane.
But then again I've seen "Ali" and Jon Voight's uncanny ability to capture Cosell.
There's a pre title credit sequence telephone conversation that climaxes in death and then we're on a set of a movie which eventually ends with cast members getting killed one by one .
If this is an accurate description of the American army, then by God, the world is in peril.
After watching this movie about a "day in the life of a restaurant," I couldn't understand the high rating it gets on IMDb, but then I noticed that most of the reviewers are former wait-persons who identified with the over-the-top caricatures of the staff and customers of these restaurants.
And then there's the imagery...Yes, clowns can be creepy.
Its one of those films that almost works but falls just short so seems more like a missed opportunity then something you actually will want to sit through.
If you want a cheap alternative to this movie, get a collection of older movie trailers, put them on back to back so it lasts an hour or so, then sit and watch it whilst flicking different coloured lights on and off now and then with some old led Zep or pink floyd music on in the background- playing backwards of course.
In fact, the plot is "tricking you" into thinking it's going to get good, and then when you're interested again, it's like - "hehehe... got you sucker...", and then continues to unfold as lamely as you subconsciously assumed it would after the first 15 minutes.
appeals to you, then you will feel cheated out of the time you wasted watching this .
This makes me wonder as Bollywood have excessive amounts of money in their grasps...why continue to make crap movies which are complete remakes and then deny the very fact that it is a remake.
If so, then it is one of the least effective comedies of the year.
Think about it, if someone meets over a hot dog at a baseball game and he essentially bullies JA as to what HE thought best, then you deserve what you get.
If you have to see this movie you should wait for the video, but even then you might be disappointed.
Save this one for DVDÂ and even then, wait for it to be taken off the "new releases" wall so you don't have to pay as much for it, or better yet, maybe you'll get lucky and your library will carry it and you will be able to pay NOTHING for itÂ which is basically what it's worth.
Their parallel destinies occasionally touch each other and finally merge at the end, although the end is shown at the beginning and the story then told in a series of fluid non-linear flashbacks.
And then there's the music.
There are some points where it sounds moderately interesting, but then Gina starts singing and it's all over.
2 of the bandmates were sexually abused when young, then one of them is raped, another dies in an accident, while the remaining one is a drug addict.
I feel as if I've been served sour milk and then been told that I've just drunk something of aesthetic merit - because it made my eyes water.
Imagine a kids film directed by Lars Von Trier, add a dash of "Amelie," a scent of "Donnie Darko," a sprinkle of Lynchian strangeness, and a good heaping of Terry Gilliam inspired wackiness, place in a blender, then travel back in time (as this movie came long before and probably inspired "Amelie" and "Donnie Darko") and voilÃ , you'll have "Toto."
And then we get to experience this miserable existence first-hand, as the film cuts between Jimmy's stand-up routines and his personal life.
As someone else on this forum noted, it works well for about the first 15-20 minutes, then decays into pointlessness.
They glossed over Jane's early days -- her childhood and time at school -- and then rewrote the love story.
Hind's Rochester at first felt spot on, moody...but then he just started yelling giving it a less than nuanced delivery.
The followup documentary reuniting some of the survivors is an exquisitely touching finale, though wouldn't it be lovely to continue the series, chronicling the gap between then and now.
But, then he released The Village.
And then he keeps stuttering.
And then there were the random shots, like when it showed the sign of The Cove while people were dying.
The followup documentary reuniting some of the survivors is an exquisitely touching finale, though wouldn't it be lovely to continue the series, chronicling the gap between then and now.
It just falls apart like one of those cartoon characters that's been hit in the head with a falling anvil: first, the head, then an arm, then..., well, you know.
But then maybe in a few years you won't even be able to find it on the shelves  IMHO I rate it 3/10
Usually to a closeup of Lee stock footage then followed by the stunt double's back.
If anyone had never seen a Bruce Lee film and then saw this, they would wonder what all the fuss was about.
It's very annoying to watch, but then there's one of those out-of-left-field endings that's supposed to justify why everyone acts brain dead throughout the entire movie.
If you're able to sit through 90 minutes of terribly depressing exploitation, you may enjoy the ending, but I suspect your finger will have pressed "stop" long before then.
If anyone likes older shows with military and watching people try to survive a living hell, then this show is wonderful to see!
One character shows up and then is gone without an explanation.
i turned it off after 1hr 15. and then wrote this, cos i hate people who think this stuff is some how great, and if you don't like it, its because its just too cool to be appreciated.
Ann Bell plays Marion Jefferson,the bored army wife,tired of all the endless tea parties and receptions then when she is evacuated with the other women,the first real shock is her best friend Vicky(Wendy Williams)drowning,Tenko certainly got shock you with the death of a popular character when you least expected it.
Series 2 to me,is the best,we meet evil Miss Hasan,(Josephine Welcome)the evil administrator at their new camp and corrupt leader Verna Johnson(Rosemary Martin)we learn at the end of series2,they both sold their red cross parcels,causing a lot of unnecessary deaths for Doctor Mason(great performance throughout by Stephanie Cole as tortured soul,Dr.Beatrice Mason) Veronica Roberts as Dorothy Bennett excels,she goes from widowed young mother to seeing her baby die,then becomes emotionally dead as she has sex with guards to get by but forms an unlikely friendship with Shinya,a Japanese guard,who has to shot Rose when she meets boyfriend Bernard,Dorothy eventually forgives him only for him to die in an allied raid.
In David Cronenberg's ridiculous attempt at a film, when the character's think of a car crash, they think of sex and then some more sex and then even more sex after that.
Crash just consists of a bunch of random sex scenes between two characters we don't even know in the first third, then consists of sex scenes between two characters we don't even give a damn about in the second third before trying to end up as some sort of tragic, poetic love story about two people who have now discovered what really sexually turns them on.
The cannibal tribe at one point early on seem to have kicked the Vikings' butts and are burning the village, then withdraw at the sound of a horn for no apparent reason.
"Stars" Sybil Danning and John Carradine are in the film for about 5 minutes each, and Cameron Mitchell has the good sense to not show up until about 50 minutes in and then gets killed about 15 minutes later.
Furthermore, back in town as the ambulances and rescue workers are dispatched from their outposts, it just goes to show that if the avalanche didn't kill you, then these silly fools just might.
If you want to see a scene involving Jeanette Nolan doing her best 'Saturday Night Fever' impression on the dance floor, then this is the movie for you.
If you want to see a pandemonium scene involving screaming victims getting hailed with styrofoam blocks, then this is the movie for you.
However, if you want to see a half-decent disaster movie, then "AVALANCHE" is not the movie for you.
The "Avalanche" doesn't happen till around the hour mark and all we get till then is totally blinding boredom.
After getting into a vicious eye scratching and hair pulling cat fight with Sally Mimi ends up getting belted by Nick who then together with Sally take off in his car away from the perusing, and now on to Nick & Sally, police headed by Let.
If you said four, based on the fact that that is how they are packaged on DVD into a two-disc four-film box-set, then you would be mistaken - there were in fact FIVE films to this series, this last one coming fourteen years after the last effort, "The Great St. Trinian's Train Robbery".
Things go awry when she kills her husband and the daughter flips out and then the story really doesn't know what to do (About 18 minutes into the film).
Elliot Gould did M*A*S*H that same year, and built a well-deserved reputation as an excellent actor, even though he's had his cinematic ups-and-downs since then, like most actors.
Every single scene in the movie is shown, the point is made, and then the scene continues for some reason.
Ninety-five percent of this film is common knowledge  (and if you don't know that corporations have taken over everything,  then you are part of the reason why we have the evil government  we have).
If everyone turned against corporations (all are not bad), then we have no economic system.
This cop is then approached by a lady doctor whose young daughter was attacked and killed by a pedophile.
I know it's "hard-core" but we all know you can do better then this.
You do not want to watch this show, trust me, unless you are stuck with one channel on your TV and this is what's on, and even then I'd just find something to do by myself.
If the police did their jobs and didn't convict whoever was available at the time for trumped up charges, then, they wouldn't need technicalities of law.
When the police have to make up a crime in order to convict someone who they "believe" guilty of a different crime, and the judge and prosecutor let that happen, then, our system is corrupt.
The cast mugs and hams and then does what it can to get from one line of the script to another.
It's a shame though that the film's style doesn't match it's content Â if it had then it could have been truly affecting and memorable.
if it is incomprehensible then it cant be really bad, and who knows it might be great.
in a handout which i picked up in the cinema the director confesses to the fact that after each days shooting she then went and wrote the screenplay for the next days filming!
And if you are thinking you know what a beatnik looks like, then think again.
If you are thinking of a tough and athletic black man with many gold chains and rings when you hear that, then is the wrong movie for you.
Except, once on the train things begin to unravel as greed takes over one of the guys, another gets jumpy and then dead bodies begin to turn up.
Well, a friend popped it in, then left the room.
This is why the sex scenes made this movie worse: In one scene one of the witches resurrects one of her sisters, then they proceed to get naked and have sex.
If you value a critic's opinion (and most people don't), then listen to what I have to say.
and then he finds the loving arms of another Filipina who (surprise!
)falls in love with him too and then just when things cannot go on any murkier, he finds his wife who is (another surprise!)
The script is basically Hitchcock's Rear Window (1954) with killer genetically created giant bugs, if that sounds appealing to you then what are you reading this for?
If it doesn't sound appealing then you, like me, may not be that impressed with Mimic: Sentinel.
Maybe Mimic: Sentinel doesn't have any plot holes or loose ends & it's a deeply complex intricately written & thought out piece of suspenseful film-making that I was too stupid to 'get', or then again maybe it's a cheap straight-to-video poorly written & contrived horror sequel that totally rips-off Rear Window & is basically rubbish, who knows...  Director Petty does OK, the film has that downbeat somewhat gray look & feel about it like the previous two with it's rundown apartment blocks.
I wouldn't bother spending money to rent it but if it's on TV and you're a completist who liked the other two Mimic films, then go ahead.
When a boy disappears in the spot and then the local drug dealer Desmond (Keith Robinson), Marvin suspects of a mysterious garbage man (Lance Henriksen) and his sister Rosy (Alexis Dziena) and her friend Carmen (Rebecca Mader) investigate him.
The film has few redeeming features, but the main one is that it is quite a good laugh to watch with a few mates when drunk, especially at the hilarious musical score and the cheap and nasty production values, (at one point it actually switches from widescreen to normal, then back to widescreen a few minutes later).
As revenge they then conspired to make a comedy that contained no laughs.
The plot is the stale one of an author who wrote a best selling self-help book and then adopts behavior that contradicts his advice.
The best we get is when Woodcock said "I'm "Basically" sorry" to the mom but after the entire movie one cant help but feel more mad then amused.
No laterally, it feels like it stop in mid-moment and then the credits start.
'Laughed 2 times: when Stifler's buddy got caught on video talking about Sarandon's boobs, and then when that piece of crap Woodcock ate the asphalt.
The trailer did many things to fool many people, as in show scenes that weren't even amusing in the film and then edit them together in a way that actually gave you quite a laugh to see in the commercial.
This crap that got thrown on the wall and did less then just not stick, it boomeranged.
Mr. Woodcock didn't exactly push me farther then that feeling of admiration.
If you've already seen those then just watch something totally different.
I expected more from the end, but then I just realized: this film looks like it's written by a crazy, emotional cripple gym teacher.
If it wanted to show a certain sect of New York as vapid, obnoxious, boring and pointless people without even any real explanation of how they became so, then I guess the film succeeded.
for the frustrated guys amongst us: watch the first five minutes and then turn it off, no more boobs from that point on (I know it was a real downer for me too) for all the rest: don't even bother looking at all, jeez.
it started with neve under the shower, OK, nice potential, and then nothing.
The incident towards the end of the film was certainly unexpected; but then again, any idiot can make unexpected things happen in a film.
Open-wheel racing in the '30s was -good-, but OW racing in the previous decade (at tracks like Beverly Hills and Culver City) was as big -- and spectacular, and fast -- then as NASCAR is now on mile ovals.
but then again how do you compliment such a bad story?
But it takes some time to get to this plot point, and up till then, the movie just meanders in a cinema-verite sort of way that makes it seem like Toback can use it as an excuse for the picture being a dud.
She plays an American student on sabbatical in Paris who, although she does not speak French, is hired by and then immediately given the keys and codes to a jewelry store to satisfy the plot!
"Tempo" opens with its exciting car chase climax, then goes into flashbacks leading up to there.
The story is supposed to take place in Paris, why is it then that throughout the film, street signs are in German??
The plot is fairly improbable: A scholar switches places with her fashion model twin and heads to Paris, then gets involved in mystery/romance/blackmail.
Now and then an occasional supporting player, a script idea, or a line of dialogue sparks the film to life--but such moments are too few and too far between to jolt this dog to life.
She exacts her revenge by stabbing victims with wood slivers, thus marking them, and then sucking them into the ground.
So unless you like the thought of a cheap chill and a laugh or too then you should most definitely stay away from this movie.
O.K., not likely, but if he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time...then maybe.
But come on, then to get killed by the same chopped falling in a bloody fire on top of his head?
If anyone agrees...write to me to tell me so, then write to NBC to take this long-dead show off the air.
goodbye E.R.as for the very last episode all i talked with were let down felt empty as if they had watch 2 hours of almost good TV but then had it jerked away at the last seconds goodbye e.r.
This film wants us to believe that a doctor in a psych ward drugs his patients and then straps a weird jacket on them and puts them in a morgue drawer for a while.
While in the drawer, it shows many close ups of Jack's eyes, then starts showing flashes of images.
And then some how Jack winds up about 15 years in the future.
And then later she sleeps with him?
At first I just thought she'd be a sign to Jack that he's time traveling, but then she ends up helping him and being the love interest?
However, if you are looking for a very guilty pleasure--sort of like "The Jerry Springer Show" combined with the Barker story, then this is for you!
I'll tell ya what they done: they stole ma pig, and then they went and killed Old Joe!"
- Character time travels to 1986, then promptly dies after telling a local young couple that a spear head he brought is special (it had pierced the body of the once called "Christ").
Not only does it have the completely bizarre factor of a dog barking at black bears, cougars and birds and then legging it, but one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen.
Thankfully, the wolf meets his demise by tossing himself off a cliff, and then falling stiff as a board down into the canyon below as if the production crew had thrown a stuffed wolf out of a plane.
Excuse me for asking, but ask I will: Are we supposed to believe that a senior citizen is able to neatly sneak into a heavily protected house, break into the owner's sanctum-sanctorum, and then witness the President of the United States having a fist fight with a woman, who is then assassinated by government employees?
And then after, we're supposed to believe that the thief is really a good guy who really cares?
It starts out slowly, with no dialog, then increases its yawn factor as words are added to this meandering, nonsensical script.
If you have read the book by David Baldacci then I highly suggest that you DO NOT watch this movie!!!!
My sister, who watched the movie then read the book also expressed displeasure at the plot changes in the movie.
Also, the editing was pretty choppy and the blood and gore were filmed at a separate time from the murder scene and were on a completely limited budget, so it kinda' looked like a buxom woman looking towards the camera and screaming (about 50 times), then a quick cut to some scene in a butcher shop.
She calls it a night and takes off in her car only to get accosted by the guy at knife point who then demands she drive him back to the parking garage claiming, "They took something from me and you are going to help me get it back!"
I have no doubt that if you turned on the Beatles White Album, drank a bottle of wine, put this movie on, and then did a crossword puzzle or something, this film could be entertaining.
The most interesting part of the story is the historical link with the nun's exorcism that we see in the beginning, then is ignored, save one line in the middle, until the post-climax 25 minutes of sloppy wrap-up with a character and her dad that we don't give a crap about anyway....Bottom line, SAVE YOURSELF....RUN FROM THIS MOVIE!!
After Porhowski (Redmond) is asked to get her interviewee some water, she returns to find him gone, and by then he's been ID'd as an ex-con who did time for drug trafficking, so they of course, want to find him.
There were more holes in the plot then there are in the Moon and none of the characters really develops in the movie.
And if he did, he would have been found out and dismissed back then and there.
And the last portion of the film was pretty much all action and by then I was ready for the next film!
And even then, only marginally.
Gangsters kill people - and the more psychotic the gangster, and the more willing they are to slaughter people who get in the way then the more successful they'll become.
However, if we, as viewers, are offered far too little, what happens then?
He lived until 54 A.D. Nero should have been 31 years old by then by any normal chronology, but in fact succeeded to the throne at age 16.
History tells us that there then followed the "Five Good Years," where Nero ruled wisely and well under the tutelage of the philosopher Seneca and the Praetorian commander Burrus.
If you have seen The Breed then you have seen the better version of this film.
If you have not seen it then watch it rather than this film.
The sound track is typical early nineties and the acting matches the soundtrack, Although this review is very negative, if you do watch this film for more than forty mins then keep going you may see a little blood......
They don't actually decide to do anything about it and then seem entirely unsurprised when he shows up again with what appear to be only minor injuries (a bit of a cut on the side of his head).
I hear you self-righteous b*stards from the back shouting "But it's for the children..." - er...if my children were on LSD, having eaten 2 spacecakes each, then perhaps this would have entertained them...
Conflicts are introduced, plod along and then are never resolved.
Look I don't wanna say much about this movie..... Its great,Bachchan is superb....But it is a complete ripoff of Brian De Palma's Scarface....Just check out both and then tell me of there's difference.. A group of bandits are in a village.They kill Bachchcan's father and almost rape his mother.
If he is willing to not tell the whole story in this account while claiming it is based on actual events, then I can not trust him to tell the truth in his documentaries.
The film starts off with Marines driving around listening to heavy metal, and then goes into a sequence of 'interviews' in the style of Full Metal Jacket on what the soldiers think of the conflict.
The Americans then take it upon themselves to kill four innocent by-standers who are in the wrong place at the wrong time while the two cooperatives responsible easily get away between two houses, shooting behind their backs as they run.
The Marines then go on a rampage, killing the occupants of three houses; women and children, all unarmed of course.
If you expect something on the lines "Black Hawk Down" then look the other way.
A Marine is told he cannot visit a doctor until after he goes home, and then only on his leave.
I was strongly tempted to press the "stop", button, something I have done for a very limited list of truly awful movies, but by then the "train wreck" syndrome had set in; i.e.
Then it could be made into a short maybe 13 or 15 min long and then it might be all right.
I saw it back then at the local Drive-In with a date.
It is bad, but then, that is part of what taking a date to the Drive-In was about.
In fact, this movie contains the single most memorable 'goof' I've ever seen in a movie: Montag is trying to put a subject (and the audience) into a trance, and he's looking into the camera doing his 'you are getting sleepy' spiel, and he's going along, and then he says (and I am NOT making this up):  "Concentrate.....*c-croncentrate* with every bit of your being....!"
Straps her on a bed and then proceeds to cut her in half with a chainsaw.
The quality of the movie didn't matter much back then as I mentioned already, I like the low-grade cheesy stuff.
But then they die shortly afterwards with the same wounds that they got during the act.
The plot is that a cheesy magician named "Montag" performs tricks that seem to mutilate female volunteers who then mysteriously die of the very same injuries they suffered on stage.
Kendell's lover Beckett then goes crazy with the two, Annie and Rodney, taking off in the confusion together with the now out of hiding Malik and barricade themselves in an upstairs bedroom.
The movie starts out in Ireland, Finbar disappears, then half the movie goes by, and then suddenly Finbar decides to phone up his old friend Danny, telling him he's in Sweden.
It's more like a staid travelogue populated with non-descript characters that say absolutely nothing but dumb banter then fade to the pretty backdrop with the main characters wandering for a few minutes too long.
I'm all for independent movies, but if the movie is as bad as it was, then you shouldn't use such a good looking cover!
It starts off with a somewhat creepy yet overplayed idea of a twisted family...then it just turns to crap.
which is then being kept in a hole in the woods.
If you'r planning to see this movie, don't expect too much, just expect to laugh... a lot!, then everything's gonna be alright.
For the past thirteen years, I have thoroughly enjoyed hunting down the many rarities that the cycle has to offer and then sharing my opinions with other collectors across the globe.
They say that if at first you don't succeed then try again, and try again she certainly did.
The movie seems to take an eternity to pick up the pace and then when things finally kick off, the shocks always feel somewhat half-hearted.
I was somewhat surprised then when I read that a sequel is in the pipeline, which must mean that this wasn't as unsuccessful as many would have you believe.
But for the moment if you must see a Swedish slasher then get Drowning Ghost instead.
Besides, the look of the film is pretty cheap (I watched this via MGM's pan-and-scan DVD, which certainly did it no favours); the death-knell is delivered, then, by the inappropriate and ultra-cheesy electronic score!
Then to top it all off we have Sean Connery in a role he'd probably rather forget as the "Green Knight", but he looks more like a Christmas decoration then an actual magical knight.
At first none of the knights are willing to accept his challenge, but then when the King gets so frustrated at his weak kingdom and offers to accept Sean's deal himself, the brave Miles O'Keefe jumps in and accepts the challenge instead!
O'Keefe takes his swing and chops Sean's head clean off...but then a really fake Sean head laying on the floor is then seen telling his body to come and pick up his head.
If you're a bad movie fan then definitely check this one out.
!,i would also say that the story is bit like the the shining.i didn't like the ending and the twist ain't that good too if u see the movie then i am sure ur gonna realize the fault that the director made (u will have to pay attention to know more faults .....there are a lot of faults) .....the ghosts die becoz the tree burns down becoz they wre living there but at the final shot they show that kid has become a ghost........how the hell did he get away ???
The movie starts off real slow with unwanted sound effects (not even effects but those silly bangs and booms to give the audience a jolt)(a cheesy one includes sounds of a tiger roar now and then) which sounded inappropriate at times.
First i thought 'God, they have copied 'The Shining' because there was this boy who goes about the house in his small cycle and his dad is a writer and then when he starts seeing the ghosts i thought 'Okay its Sixth Sense now' but it was not even so.
When he tells his parents they become worried coz of the weird things their child is talking about but then the maid gets killed and all the stuff is found which she stole so Sush realizes her kid was indeed seeing the ghosts all the while.
He seems to know the story behind the family in the house and jumps in front of Sush's car whenever she goes to the hospital (she is playing a doctor)  Throughout the movie the kid keeps seeing the zombie family (which is not at all scary) and one night he and his parents go out for a movie, Sush's sis Radhika (played by Piya) is alone in the house and her boyfriend Murali comes to the house (Purab that channel [V] VJ) and starts playing with her in bed and then suddenly he disappears (The crappy part starts now).
MAJOR SPOILERS  Radhika starts searching him and then gets killed by the zombies.
).Sush wakes up in the hospital and finds her son okay and then when she picks him up the last shot of the scene shows the boy (her son) is also a zombie i.e.
Now if sole intention of the Ghosts is to kill the inhabitants of that house then why they waited till 2 hours of movie's running time, and get to work only in the climax.
Watch something like Nosferatu, which was made in 1922, and then watch this, made over 50 years later and wonder why editing technology hasn't advanced in such a large period of time.
The film opens with grave quotes from law enforcement experts on how teen gangs are the "corrosive acid to our society" and so on, and then the movie opens with a bunch teen gang members driving around to a song so non-threatening, so soft, so flaccid that it is unintentionally hilarious.
Emile was in the hospital for one month ask who was with him every day morning and night?When i hear the whole story then I will rate that story and not until then.
2) The car in the garage that has been sat rusting for years works first time they try and then....surprise surprise.
The guys could have gone nuts and turned on each other like fighting dogs then Michelles character.
They could have both just turned on Michelle, they could have let them been saved and then showed the virus spreading to another place.
Well Wes, if you still are promoting those kind of horrors then surely this will be your last appearance on the set, got it?
Not much more to say really, I guess if you already are afraid of dogs like some people are then you might get scared but otherwise, no.
The most stupid thing in the film is that every time they kill one dog then two dogs appear out of nowhere maybe there is a Killer Dog factory around the place somewhere.
This movie then goes so far as to convict Moore of actually manufacturing not one, but all elements of the story.
Melnyk has the camera focus on herself intermittently as she plays "investigative journalist on the phone taking notes", then puts forth the message in her film that Moore's including himself in his films is bad film-making.
Yeah people, talk about how pointed & biased Moore is in his movies, & then go & watch the History Channel & say that it's documentaries & history on religion are based completely on NON-DISPUTABLE FACTS.
Just making Moore look like an inconsiderate assh*** & then letting those who represent the completely opposing views have their say, while throwing all the trash they can on Moore's work, causes me to suspect whether these film makers were ever truly fans of Moore.
They then attempt to build sympathy with the audience, appearing shocked and indignant first when they ambush him (What?
They showed a group of Flint High School girls doing some sort of irritatingly silly amateur schoolie play that mocks "Roger and Me" (the kind that only the mostly blindly adoring of right wing parents would be able to endure in their pompous little brats), and then the teenage girl "writer" of this play is interviewed, and she claims that Moore "fabricated" a news report that shows a female reporter stating that a Nightline report was cancelled because their news van was stolen, even as the scene from the film with her report is being shown over the girl's claims.
An argument goes like this:  1) If p, then q.
And unless you entirely support George Bush, then you have absolutely no reason to be offended by such an association to Michael Moore!
I am all in favour of films to counterbalance the polemics of Michael Moore, but please don't accuse him of manipulating footage and then do exactly that, adding sinister music.
This movie then goes so far as to convict Moore of actually manufacturing not one, but all elements of the story.
Stay away from this, even as a rental.I picked this up in Chinatown for five bucks on DVD and feel I was over charged (and ripped off since the DVD only had one set of 3-D glasses in it- then again the 3-D didn't always work) 3 out of 10.
then you will love this movie.
This film is simply about a bunch of women who pick men who's behaviors they claim to hate & then spend the rest of their time complaining about them.
"Waiting To Exhale" in the end is nothing more then a boringly pointless film that wastes the potential it had with the cast.
Susan Cabot plays the good girl with first a yen for McNally and then for Murphy.
Would there then be huge parties in Britain???
If Benny Hill makes you burst out laughing, then go rent it.
Two cow punchers decide on a whim to rob a bank (just about the dullest 25 minute bank robbery in history), then go on the trot to Mexico pursued by two characters played by Tom Skeritt and Joe Don Baker who really have no character development and have not much to do with anything.
Sorry, if you subject the audience to 120 Minutes of nothingness and then pound them with repetitive metaphors, pack all this with the same repetitive music (so what does it mean they listen to the same song throughout the movie when driving in their hummer ... ah, the same as the rest of this repetitive metaphor??)
"C'est bon," she replies, then, "Pas bon."
During one scene, when a swain aims a punch at his rival, the actor cannot simply throw a punch: he must put his fist up against the other man's face, and then shove.
And then there's the evil corporation, SiNtech.
We then find ourselves in the city morgue where we're introduced to the protagonist - a young, beautiful (is there any other kind?
But then you stumble upon Autopsy.
The screenwriters should had based their story more on "Falcons of France," written by Charles Nordoff and James Norman Hall (famous later for writing Mutiny on the Bounty), about their experiences training and then flying for the French in the famous Lafayette Escadrille.
Why in the hell was he flying at gunpoint until then?
if you love this then check out his other films.......... 10/10.........j.d Seaton
It's Horrors of war painted by numbers, lets have the veteran seen it all, lets have the fearless guy and then just so people know war can be nasty lets have a shell shock guy.
If you want to see a movie in which the CGI flying sequences are cluttered and unconvincing, where the hero takes no evasive action at all as the nasty guy in the black Fokker sits on his tail taking careful aim, where airplanes continuously fly through the camera, where bullets make holes as big as pie plates when they hit fabric instead of punching though it, where our hero cannot lift the fabric-covered wing off his friend's hand, where a girl learns English in two easy lessons, where the Squadron CO gives the hero a medal for disobeying a direct order, where the hero is out of uniform half the time, and where nobody at all says a damned thing worth listening to, then by all means go see "Flyboys".
There is a a lot of senseless action in the movie that has no flow, people die needlessly and repeatedly, there is scary music when there is no need for it, importance is placed on certain roles and then they are removed from the movie by being killed off, and the action scenes involving the lead actress is like watching a Barbie doll trying to defend herself.
There's a healthy number of car chases, fistfights, gundowns and just about anything you would expect from a film of this kind, but it's all done with such a workmanlike air from Marino Girolami (Castellari's father) that I couldn't help but glance at my watch every now and then.
Polizioto fans that need their fix will be satisfied by Roma Violenta, but if you haven't seen true genre classics like The Cynic, The Rat and The Fist, Almost Human or La Mala Ordina, then Roma Violenta can wait.
No matter the reply, he grins stupidly, mumbles "you forgot to say 'Simon says'", and then proceeds to kill everyone in the scene.
Granted movie does have and interesting and unconventional opening but then it falls for every horror clichÃ© around.
Some party made me laugh and reminded me of the Freddy Krueger Horror-Fun like when stoner guy is killed with a giant spliff and then set aflame.
The young gangster goes on a rampage, pitting Mays with a rival gang member, then brutally murdering Mays' rival and framing him for the murder which sends Mays to jail.
He then emerges as the main gangster and lets loose on his up to then pent-up violence... that is, until the story reaches full circle and all three main characters are reunited.
She's come a long way (acting wise) since then.
Kara arrives in the earth and becomes immediately Supergirl: the maid of steal: with super-costume red-blue with the big S in the chest and then assumes the secret identity of school-girl Linda Lee and takes lodging in the local college; her roommate is Lois Lane's sister Lucy.
Helen Slater is hot for sure,but that doesn't make the movie necessarily good.the Superman movies,at least the first 2,had an epic quality to them.this movie just seems like it was slapped together with very little thought.if you're not gonna have a villain worthy of the hero,then what's the point?that's an element that should be essential in this type of movie.the scope of the movie is just too small.at the end of the movie,there is no real lasting impact.while it wouldn't say this movie is abysmal,it certainly is not very good either.it won't likely be the worst movie you see, but it should have been so much better.the most i can squeeze out for this movie is 4/10
This end of the 80's piece is as dark as it got back then.
And then the film takes some awful 1984-inspired turns and mysterious conspiracies like "The blue panther", "unexpected deaths" and "the 31st Floor" become visible.
Needless to say, Fassbinder somehow cracks the case and then he screws a picture of an astronaut.
Did the really think people would like it so much that they'd tell their friends to go see it, and then buy it when released on DVD?
Its easy to see why people think this film is over violent and trying to shock, but then thats because they just don't get the finer nuances.
Though the cutting could have saved the film, but then the musters should have been cut lengthwise.
If you have any other way of spending 90 minutes then don't choose this movie.
For example here is a plot summary--> there is a good guy (Orlando Jones) and a bad guy (Eddie Griffin) who has a dog that hates the good guy, but then the good guy is framed (by apparently the bad guys using what is called a "Double Take", but was he really framed by the good guys imitating the bad guys?
So, then the bad guy (Griffin) changes places with the good guy (Jones).
So then wait, Jones apparently had a child with someone so that they could pull a " double take" on the real bad guys, only Griffin is still bad and the U.S. cops are bad, but the undercover cops are good, but the undercover mofia as undercover cops are bad, and eventually the head moffia boss guy is also good, but only until he is bad again.
And then.....  Well, if you made it this far and really want to know, watch the movie.
If you liked Jimunji, then just watch it again rather than ruin your self with this dreadful film.
If you enjoy watching two young brothers shouting at each other over and over and over again then this may be for you!
The one judge x's everybody before they start and then when the other two don't because they want to give the talent at least a chance to perform, he reaches over and x's their buttons for them stopping the talent.
Also why do they X talent and then still send them through??
What the Hell happened to network programming since then?
And Brandy did the same thing, when the Snow White contestant was stripping on this week's show - she found it offensive and she buzzed in and then proceeded to try desperately to hit Hasselhoff's and the British guy's buzzers, until she finally succeeded.
the audience dosen't help either, every time someone comes on stage only to be told that they suck, they cry, and then get pushed into the finals anyway, so whats the point?
If you enjoy the "Underdog overcomes all obstacles" type movie, then you may like this film, but I have to say I wasn't all that impressed.
But dear "Hollywood", you can't make a box-office hit if you first of all take the Danish humor away, and then take out some scenes from the movie, just because (my own opinion)you think it doesn't suits the American people.
A law student has a whacked out, bored best friend, a really nice but under-defined girlfriend, some sort of poorly outlined, difficult childhood past and then gets a job as a nightwatchman in a morgue to pay for school.
Only a monk and a feral child survived - then went missing.
I saw a trailer for Shrooms months ago and had decided there and then that I would see it and it would be awesome!
After the first few initial jumpy moments, it's really slow and then to top it all off it has the worst ending ever.
In which I would rather get high on mushrooms or whatever, then endure this again!
And then it started to go wrong and the horror clichÃ©s were unleashed..
Why make a film set in Ireland & then cast all main characters as American I'll never understand but it explains why the film was so obsessed with promoting Ireland as some sort of drug paradise.
If you do, and can understand them, then maybe we'll go sometime and I can learn to understand and enjoy, in fact I am always looking to broaden my horizons, in fact just ever get a chance to watch Dexter on show-time, now that will make you think.
I am however a fan of cinema and horror movies and take offense when a 'popular' director picks a 'popular' genre and makes a total pigs ear out of it, when I then in turn am expected to shell out premium prices for someone else's vanity and back-clapping.
There are few genuine scares, yet the film generates some definite frissons along the way: Lockwood, a mediocre pianist at best, suddenly playing a piece faultlessly in front of guests; the girl's spontaneous quotation from a poem she readily admits to being unfamiliar with; and, especially, her close encounter with an unseen entity (woken up by the piano mysteriously playing at night, we hear its lid being violently shut when she enters the room, followed by the camera's swift panning Â suggesting something had gone past her Â and then hushed voices plotting murder in the hallway).
And Back then the science types were the called nerds.
This was a typical "loser girl from middle school gets scorn by the school hottie, then gets her revenge" type movie.
But then they broke up.
The movie suffered a little bit from the script, but then again I tend to be picky when it comes to delivery, so this might just be personal bias.
Not being noticed when we are young, and then blossoming and getting the guys attention later on.
So, I watched this and then came to IMDb, only to be surprised how many comments (18 before me) it had.
And then there was this kinda plump girl, who surely was destined to be restricted to side roles for the rest of her career.
Gabby comes up with a plan to have him fall in love with Mel and then break his heart just like he did to her.
Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice then becomes primarily an exploration of how average middle class folks deal with attempts to incorporate hippie sexual liberation beliefs into their lives.
The ending of the film is highly unusual but effective, although especially for me--as someone who champions extremely liberal sexuality and thinks monogamy isn't really a great idea--there was a contradictory one-two punch of being disheartening, then shortly after uplifting.
Next thing I knew, I was fast-forwarding past another part that had just become tiresome, then another, then another, and I had to make myself stop.
Back at the time this movie was released, it was interesting because it dealt with social issues that were then current.
He enjoys setting up farcial situations and then underlining the laughs with either seriousness or a sense of melancholy.
There is one scene in a discotheque that Mazursky must have known even then would be a source of laughter and certainly, today, it's a hoot.
The beginning truly captures the free and concept-expanding atmosphere that is the Esalen Institute, which itself has not changed much since then.
In the first one the entire band's clothing "magically" changes for a concert, but if you know that this is merely a representation of the character's psychological state and not a literal change, then the film works much better.
The jewelry store job goes wrong when one of the robbers shoots an interfering tourist - and are then double-crossed by the jewelry store owner.
Director, Jason Connell does a good job of picking interesting characters to follow and then keeps the film moving.
He introduces you to the characters in the story, then he starts to develop a plot that you're going to see, even if it is predictable.
The movie begins by showing Argentina in crisis, and then goes back in time to some of the problems that predicated the crisis.
Gidget then pretends that it's the Big Kahuna (a young, buff, and tanned Cliff Robertson) she's out to get, and ends up getting in a little deeper than she planned to.
At least TCM airs it in widescreen, and then the color looks crisp, clear and glorious.
I am holding out hope that Sony will rerelease the Gidget films and some of the aforementioned in better quality conditions someday, but my hair might be grey by then.
The story is not too complicated, girl likes boy, girl chases boy who is a surfer, girl learns to surf and tries to make boy jealous, boy pretends he is not interested, then comes unglued when she is with someone else.
Manmohan Desai was known for larger then life entertaining and illogical films AAA is one of them   The film marked one of Bachchan- MD most famous films and also a blockbuster  The plot is the similar long lost brothers theme but it's well handled and entertaining  The plot is revealed in the initial 20 mins itself which is damn serious but then the film gets funny and entertaining Amitabh's character is one of the best parts, Anthony Gonsalves became a big rage and is remembered even today The scenes between Amitabh- Vinod, the fight and the jail scenes are well handled(in PARVARISH surprisingly both played opposite roles of cop and thief) though the long lost theme isn't taken much further like other films(meaning the searching of the siblings.etc) but the film is more on entertainment then story  The film then focuses on love stories between Amitabh- Parveen, Rishi- Neetu.etc There are several entertaining scenes like Bachchan carrying Mukri to the hospital, Amitabh's long drunken monologue, Amitabh- Pran scene and many more There are too many songs though, like after the famous MY NAME IS ANTHONY GONSALVES in few minutes there is HUMKO TUMSE HO GAYA and PYAAR KE DUSHMAN   The film ends too in a slapstick manner with the disguises which also got famous and the long fight scene  Direction by MD is fabulous Music is good too  Amongst actors Though an esemble cast Amitabh towers above all and no doubt his character of Anthony became a rage and won him best actor award too He excelled in his character which is completely different from what Bachchan did mostly Vinod Khanna plays the cop role with elan and his last funny act is hilarious Rishi is a natural in his role and he is at his best towards the end Amongst the girls Neetu is alright, Shabana irritates, Parveen is very good Pran excels, Jeevan is as usual Hercules is okay
Kishenlal then takes his sons with him while being chased by Robert's henchmen.
She then becomes homeless and thinks that her husband and sons are dead.
He stops by his house to find a "sucide" letter from his wife so he takes his kids and drives off to somewhere then put's his kids in some random park.
Akbar was raised by a Muslim by the time he found the child he was going to drive home but to see Akbar's mom in the street then the Muslim guy takes her to her home but she's blind!
The mom loses bunch of blood then is rushed to her hospital but what the kids don't know is that they are brothers and they really don't know there real mother nor does the mother know her kids due to her being blind.
so they donate blood all to there mom then here comes the opening cerdits with a very touching song.
You could definitely tell that the youngling director had some talent then.
Watch as Jeremy slowly unravels as he sees Uncle's casket appear, then open, then show someone rising slowly walking to the front door of the manor.
If you like classic shows like The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, The Nightstalker, and others, and classic Horror, Crime, Thrillers, Dramas, and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to go over to Amazon.com and buy this film that is also included with the complete first season on DVD today!
My advice: watch the first two, then stop, rewind, and eject.
The crew followed these actors for 8 months and then edited for over a year, and it shows.
the first stars Roddy McDowall as a bastard nephew who kills his uncle to take his money, then is haunted by the ghost of the uncle (or so he thinks) to death.
This film set in Chicago in 1952 starts ponderously with a voice-over of 'the voice of the city', strangely that of actor Chill Wills (whose voice is more that of a cowpoke or a ranch hand, thus highly unsuitable for this purpose), who then appears in the crime story as a ghostly police sergeant representing the spirit of the city.
like i said its funny but its pretty darn good too.......................  the film is about people being filmed without knowing it and getting their reactions to unusual encounters mainly with nudity, like a naked lady asking for directions, one asks some ppl to kiss her, and a naked girl in an elevator, and then has video of ppl discussing the film after they watched it...........  so if you haven't seen this and you like stuff like candid camera and things like that you'll like this, but this is also more than that, so ya i recommend it, if you can ever find it
If you're like me and drool like an over-hormonal teenager when that unlikely sex-symbol James Nesbitt smiles his cheeky-charming smile then you MUST go and see this film.
If you hate what I wrote then fine but watch Transformers: Armada give it a try.
I liked Toonami a lot back then only to once again discover another Transformers Anime series.
If you are a true Transformers fan then stay away from this like the plague.
But then, he was under contract.
i would have rather watched grass grow, hung myself, or stab myself in the eye with a knife then watch this movie.
However if you go into it knowing that, then it's actually a great movie.
If "Buffy the Vampire" is high school, then this is Post Graduate.
The narrative of this film is as follows:  Good guys mess around a bit, then go to another planet to fight something.
Broly himself is an amazing character, as he does a good job pretending to be good then losing it when Kakarot aka Goku shows up.
Jack then suddenly dies, and Adrienne comes to find out that her seemingly dead husband was not who he said he was.
You'll feel like you really want to fly a Valkyrie, then transform it into a Gerwalk or a Battroid to do battle for your race!
People don't just move their eyes and lips (as was the case in virtually 99% of animation then); their hair moves, their clothes show wrinkles, whilst the background details are nearly inch-perfect.
However, even this you can except a lot of "stupid" but some of that is part of Varney's charm as the lovable "Ernest P. Worrell," a man he made famous first with TV commercials and then with a handful of inane-but- Innocent comedies.
all in all it could have been better, but then it could have been a lot worse.
i have seen it more then a dosen times and it was worth every minut.
Or we're handed a world that is set up in a very deliberate, expert manner, then expected to accept the fact that anything goes, no matter how ridiculous or silly the film unfolds after the halfway point, like in Event Horizon.
If you like thrillers and mysteries then this is your kind of movie.
But, then again, how many movies have been made that have a cookie cutter plot?
But then we have Diederich Hessling.
But then the film moves into a more heavy- handed satire of complacent bourgeois German nationalism and society.
He directed films in East Germany, then West Germany, then a unified Germany.
Cliff gazes up from his living room window at Norma's plane flying overhead, then turns and walks away, at which point Marian materializes beside him and takes his arm, saying something like, "You haven't been yourself lately", to which Cliff replies, "I'm all right now".
But, then again it is his strong reaction which is the catapult of all that happens later in the film.
But then again with Stanwyck anything is good!)
If you like the idea of constructing a musical instrument out of recycled piping, an umbrella and the motor of a portable fan, then you're going to like this film no matter what.
But if you're interested in artistic films that take you on a journey, then I think you should see 'Eli, Eli, Lema Sabachthani?'.
Yeah, I got chocked up every now and then, but not like this, this is weeping.
I thought it was great back then.
If you take it as a serious film it rates very low, but if you think of it as a comedy then it could be rated quite highly.
One pirate wears a Gray shirt and one wears an orange one:  Kyle McLauchlan shoots one of the pirates (the one in the Gray shirt,  the one in orange has magically disappeared) then he reloads, aims,  and shoots THE SAME GREY SHIRT PIRATE off the cliff again!
Only when Nemo warns him that the island is dangerous due to giant creatures, does he react with surprise and disbelief... well what's that in front of your face then you dummy???
Besides all that, I will be perfectly happy to live out the rest of my life and never again see a movie in which someone washes up onto a beach, sleeping soundly, and then coughs once or twice before getting up to go exploring.
For lots of people, Requiem is essentially the spiritual ending for the X Files and it's certainly far more rewarding and powerful then The Truth.
Skinner almost cries, and then another bombshell: Scully's pregnant.
I put myself in Billy's shoes and wonder if they knew that last time I saw them or if they've learned about it since then.
I love that scene when Mulder, Skinner and these two are in Mulder's office and he tries to attack Krycek and then they are standing around talking when Scully walks in.
There's also a joke where two characters are discussing the robbery they're going to pull when one exclaims " Let's get out of here , it's like a public park " The camera then pulls away to indeed show the conversation was taking place in a public park .
The entire movie is pretty much introducing you to their misery (in a humorous manner, no less) and then the planning (which is quite amusing).
Watch it, it is shown now and then on Channel five in the daytime.
Full of (then) unknown actors TSF is a great big cuddly romp of a film.
I saw this 1978 "made-for-TV" film the first time it was aired, and once or twice since then (though not recently) and have never been able to forget it.
I saw this unforgettable movie more then 20 years ago and have never forgotton it.The movie, whos etitle I had forgotton until I found it on imdb is simply transfixing, it's to the movie's credit that with all the movies I've seen since this has been such an unforgettable one.
But I will say this: It reminded me just a tad of "war of the roses"(not alot but there was similiarities) but this movie was everything war of the roses could not possibly be.I have to watch it again and then maybe I'll post another review but anyone who likes tragic movies with beautiful photography and fascinating character development will probebly enjoy this.Unforgettable!  
The film starts off in a parallel fashion to the famous Orson Wells radio drama of 1938; opening with "ordinary programming," which is then cut in upon by a brief news bulletin that reports of meteors had struck the Earth, in three countries: France, China, and the USA.
Giving me the creeps and chills every now and then when i go to bed (it just wont go off).
I must say that I was almost sucked in from then on.
If you are reading this then its already too late.
This like it's going to be a good slasher at the beginning, when in the second scene, Bigman defeats another bikie in a jousting match with chains, then soon after another of his gang punches a nun to death, but it goes very quiet after that and never picks up.
And then there's the..
if the fluff is just to fill time then that's what you got.
The documentary segments might have been somewhat interesting, if only for their multi-national take on a common theme, except for the fact that they were edited in such a way as to jump from person to person within a topic, then back again, in no apparent order.
It was interesting, I really liked the foreign use of language and subtitle, It makes the story more real rather then fake Hollywood.
If the fictional part of the story was just as candid and raw as the documentary portion, then the film would've been better.
If you like good looking women showing their breasts then this film is still not for you.
She's more like a drunk slut exposing herself to males during blackouts and wakes then up in embarrassment.
The possessed teenage girl trapped in her room & tied to her bed, an early scene with a Ouija board, frantic parents seeking help first from doctor's & then priest's, the final climatic exorcism which is so badly written & handled it's untrue & a few of the notorious trademark scenes from The Exorcist are clearly replicated here such as the spider walk (quite literally here as Gail walks up a wall), speaking in an ancient language, lots of unintentionally funny porno dialogue as Gail spouts various obscenities & of course the final exorcism itself which is performed by a priest wearing sunglasses!
The title starred at me blankly from the cinema monitor and the words" possessed" and "exorcism" appealed more to me then Brock back Mountain.
I know a few people that enjoyed this much more then The Exorcism of Emily Rose (which is another way underrated horror/Drama movie) I found this movie at my local Hollywood Video store, and hopefully you won't have too much trouble finding it.
Take a few steps down the story, things are looking up; then a another and they gets spooky again.
If you like to watch a confused priest, who wants to act funny and prevent the apocalypse to happen then maybe this is your movie, but definitely not the movie for me :P My personal opinion is that this movie really sux, and i had to write that down, because i saw the ratings here on the movie and expected something good.
I was in my 20's then and it really appealed to me.
The scenes with most tension and terror deal with the satanic ritual where a black goat appears and when the devil makes a terrifying appearance (standing up confronting JosÃ© Mari and throwing him out of the tower and then confronting the priest) I understand now how "Drag Me To Hell" got inspired in the use of shadows and the talking goat.
A priest, trying to do evil like an amateur and then getting beat up at a death metal show.
Of course, despite all his bumbling, Father Angel is perhaps correct, but it's a break-neck race to the finish to find the correct location of the birth and plot side-lines and the main story all collide at once to make a rather spectacular ending and then a rather quiet epilogue.
If the latter is the true turn of events, then the movie is heartbreaking.
The opening scenes introduced two of the main characters well but other then that it should have been explained what had been going on exactly.
Every now and then I'm inspired by a story and want to write something myself along the same lines, this had one of those inspiring stories.
It does not take long before said beast/weapon is awaken and then all hell brakes loose.
Crystal is a woman who has a husband who just plain left her and found another woman and then he is asking her for a divorce, but Crystal will not give him a divorce.
And then again, perhaps not."
Dark and philosophical, it introduces the viewer to three people, strangers to one another, and then follows their sad, desperate lives.
While one reviewer on this site says it's a shame they don't make movies like this anymore, the fact is, they almost never made movies like this back then.
It wreaked of populist myths of the Orient and then ended with the statement that the film's location was London.
So the wish is that their sweepstakes ticket win, and the agreement is that it then be entered into the horse race that follows.
I desperately tried to like this having first seen it aged eight, but what seemed exciting / scary back then, I find pretty lame now.
It started off like an action movie for a minute, then it goes back into time to the lead-characters youths.
If you happened to like SUGAR HILL then you might like it, but I don't like neither.
I must have seen this movie more then a hundred times, know every lines.
The morons don't reallies the place is closed, I don't know if was drugs they took or what but you have to blind not to see the place is closed, then there killed by a heavy metal reject from Killer Klowns From Outer Space!
Being a diehard Les Miserables fan, I first learned the musical and then read the book.
if they can eat the dogs then why not go ahead and drink the blood.
If you can watch this film until the end, then you will never consider any film boring.
i guess if you're an older person, then you wont like it as much.
The screenplay from The Canyon does not offer too many surprises, but it produces an adequate level of suspense and tension thanks to its good structure.One of the fails I found on this movie is that I think a few scenes could have easily been deleted from the movie, not because they are boring, but because they add nothing to the story and they break the rhythm a little bit.And then, the characters make some stupid decisions and they occasionally do not behave naturally.
If you like this type of stuff (tastefully morbid and ironic things), then I highly recommend you check Dead Like Me Out.
The idea of a soul being sold to the devil and then being forced to do the devils dirty deeds has been seen before but not like this.
Story starts of well, get's a bit slow for a couple of episodes, then it picks up again, gives us some unexpected twists, and just for the story(it got interesting) and the Devil(do I even need to explain why I like him?)
Every episode is another exercise of giving the audience hope, and then somehow spoiling it.
He then finds out the hard way that his parents sold his soul to the devil before was even born.
The show takes you out of the land of religion and plops you in sunny suburbia, with a guy who just can't get things right, and then finds out he has to work for the devil.
If you haven't checked out this show yet, then I suggest you do.
As I have gotten older I can completely relate to the changes the characters go through,as even surfers have to grow up sometime,and its only then that you realize the significance of the more innocent times of youth when life really is a lot more simple and a whole lot of fun.
Back then surfing wasn't about the big buck tournaments they have now it was time well spent with your compadres and the film reflected that time.
Remake this movie...I hope not because it captured the essence of the California beach scene then and William Katt, Gary Busey and Jan Michael Vincent portrayed 3 very typical California surfers of the time, and it would be almost impossible to capture that spirit again.
"Gable and Lombard" captures the Hollywood scene of the 1930's a bit better than the other film does, and the two leads are more believable then in the other film.
I imagine many people will probably enjoy this film but it's nothing more then a silly Hollywood romance that just happened to involve one of the biggest movie stars of the day.
Even more important it's a lot better to be an honest cop then a dirty one in both having a clear conscience and long lifespan.
The claustrophobic script cooks up many interesting sub-plots with authenticity and emotion, as the pulsating violence never overstays it's welcome because it's established through the material, then just being there for the sake of it.
They then shoot their way past two real policemen with the help of their getaway driver.
Harlem is not shown in a productive light, but then neither is the police nor the mob.
Possibly we could then argue that Eisenstein's and Alexandrov's "Romance Sentimentale", an attempt to create a narrative for an Opera that they call "that old Russian song", is one of the first music videos?
Since then, I've been keeping an eye out for his films, so when this turned out to be showing as part of the French Film Festival, I knew I had to see it.
But Drive-Thru's script then proceeds to overturn most of the conventional rules of the slasher movie genre.
People were more reverent then; their moral scruples were more intact and we must remember that we just emerged victorious from the Second World War and were then fighting the Korean War, so nationalism was more prevalent; respect for the flag and country was almost an anticipated action; no flag burning then!
If you like a myriad of emotions within a movie then I would definitely recommend this one.
Louis B. Mayer's answer to his most cooperative of stars was to cast him first in A Yank At Oxford and then in The Crowd Roars.
In one final and unselfish act Mr. McCoy became the father to Tommy that up until then he never was; you can just guess what happened in that faithful eight round after The battered and almost beaten Tommy McCoy heard that bit of news.
'Drive Thru' is a very deranged comedy that seems like it was directed by some pothead like Danny Leiner.Surprisingly, it's not a bad movie.It has it's share of blood, gore, violence, and what horror movie like this one wouldn't have any humor?It's like 'Eight Legged Frieks' and 'Tremors', except the killer is not a giant spider or an underground worm.I watched this movie for free on Fearnet On Demand a year ago just to see if it was any good.For 83 minutes, I sat through which appeared to be a dumb horror movie, yet a somewhat smart comedy.If you enjoy movies about killer clowns who butcher people, then 'Drive Thru' is on the menu.Would you like some blood with your order?
But even ignoring that, the cartoon is still quite clever (as were all the cartoons released through Warner Bros. back then).
She said it was the best cartoon in the universe and then did the "I Love to Singa" dance.
The gorilla seems to know his way around the house and is always a step ahead of the buffoonish as well as defective detectives, Garrity Harrigan & Mulligan, making them look and act more like monkeys then him.
The three are then confronted by another gorilla, who has nothing to do with the gorilla's string of murders.
Those who first saw the series and became loyal followers in the 80's had every reason to be impressed back then.
this is very good movie about the wreck of titanic it is unscripted and the don't now Wat they are doing they test new robots name bot1 and bot2 later the changed their name into Jake and Elwood just like Blusebrothers and then they explore the ship in places that had never seen since 1912 i will give this movie 8 because i liked it wen the were telling the story about the ship and they show the rooms digital-ed in computer it is very cool.
About thirty minutes into the film, I thought this was one of the weakest "Columbo"s ever because it had the usual beginning (a murder happening, then Columbo coming, inspecting everything and interrogating the main suspect) squared!
But then there was a surprising twist that turned this episode into a most exciting one.
When I read these reviews I try to find someone who appears to have a similar outlook to myself and then predict if I will like the film or not before I go to see it.
My guess is that if you really loved Apollo 13 then you will have a great time watching this movie.
From then on, the show becomes more like a classical whodunit.
The ghosts refer to the super-imposed figures of that bygone era, who give us a glimpse of what it would have been like to travel on the Titanic back then.
Using the then latest technology he first located the wreck and then filmed it with "Alvin," a submersible of amazing capability.
I think there are people in the world who would relish a movie like this, but if cliches, and telegraphed plot twists turn your stomach, then avoid this movie.
I always thought he looked like a typical waiter at a Spanish restaurant, but then maybe those were the kind of guys women wanted back in the 1930s.
Lucy sees some guy who can barely ask for directions to the bathroom; and she listens to his mambo music which she had never heard and did not like; and then she falls in love.
I always thought Lucy & Desi were like a puzzle that did not fit, and they also thought so too; as they had a terrible divorce and then miserable lives afterwards.
It does explain how Reggie is involved but it's rather throwaway and unconvincing , the script would have been much better if it concentrated on niggling little things like how can characters be abducted from a supermarket and brought into a busy nightclub without anyone calling the cops   If you loved the original then you might enjoy this sequel but it was spoiled by a very clumsy script
Well it's a typical "Buddie Movie" as they did back then (like from the middle 80ties to the beginning of the nineties)... like the first Lethal Weapon Movie.
Why spend so much money and effort on some scenes and then blow it on basic glitches like that?
But then most sequels do.
Jack then asks Reggie help him, but Reggie asks for the money Jack has been holding on to for him.
then definitely give this a shot.
This unfunny comedy establishes a weak premise - an astronomer's lonely wife takes up astrology - then largely abandons it, turning to a variety of creaky devices that just don't work.
She then announces she's leaving her husband, to his consternation.
Characters get rather elaborate introductions and then play no more than the usual minor roles.
The main character was supposedly born around 1936, and the cars in the later scenes were early 1980s models, so the Duvall character would then have been about 46.
Don't misunderstand me, I'm not a particularly religious person myself, but I think I'm intelligent enough to know that men of god don't go around drinking whiskey, and killing people with baseball bats, then running away, and of all the nerve, starting a new ministry.
Farrah Fawcett plays a good part opposite him as his wife and the movie seems to split apart in the middle then pulls itself right back together again as Duvall commands the part.
If you like a film with a message that prompts you to think, then see this movie.
Unless you'd like to build a stable in your backyard for your unicorns or ride a giraffe to work backwards, then don't watch this movie.
I watched this movie and then, boom, diarrhea.
then this is your kind of movie.
Yes, almost everyone seem to act rather lousy, but that may be deliberate, just to make the story even more funny and then are many flying scenes rather sketchy, like a comic strip, but may be deliberate!
What I saw was the male lead chase the female lead after she had been teasing him, then he wrestled her and pinned her down to introduce her to Western-style kissing.
I've been a fan of the novel for quite a long time, in fact one of the publishing agents came to give a lecture when I was in college on the nature of getting your work published and kept citing the due to be released novel as an example and even then the premise he described sounded amazing.
There is no opportunity to waver in the belief of this man moving through time, you see it straight away and then you continue on the journey to see what will occur as a result.
And if you take a chance and find the love of your life, then it is life worth having lived.
The film creates a great sense of atmosphere, with the long hallways and the tremendously and unnecessarily elaborate living quarters that Mary is placed in, and we see some wonderful things as Mary sneaks around to explore the mansion, although she really only goes into one room and then her explorations are over.
We briefly see Mary's life in India and we see a heavily diluted version of the part where she realizes what has happened to her parents, and then she is moved to Misselthwaite.
There are certainly some things from the novel that are left out of the movie with good reason, such as this scene where the narrative goes into the thoughts of the robins, which can only be disorienting and awkward unless it was done much earlier in the novel (and even then it would not have fit too well with the rest of the story).
The ham-handed delivery of the moral at the beginning of Chapter 17 is also left out with good reason, but then there are little things changed as well, such as the simplification of the plot which takes away from the magic of the story as a whole, and even smaller things, like the fact that the command that Mary teaches Colin to tell her servants that he is done with them is changed from `You have my permission to go,' in the novel, to `I have spoken, all depart,' in the book.
At first I thought I was only going to view the first 10 minutes then hit the bed, but I simply couldn't stop.
(If you know the movie, you'd find that I'm ignoring pretty much)  Because I'm *cynical*, it doesn't make the 10: so 9 out of 10, then!
In a time when more and more films are relying on special effects rather then a good script and a decent storyline, this is one that film makers everywhere should take note of.
Her entry into the film is as a 10 year old girl who is catered hand and foot, literally, bathed and dressed by Indian nannies, then ignored by her parents.
I can only imagine the discipline it must have taken to wait for the sun to peep out from the clouds and then roll film hoping that the cast can pull off the shot before the light changed and a second take became a long wait.
There are also some major holes, like there is a point where everybody is surrounded by zombies right when they first get attacked, then the scene changes and some of the team are just running, wow, I guess the zombies just let them by eh?
It is advisable to have all that stuff in this movie, then RE can be graded as class A pictures.
I first viewed the film when I was six and then I didn't understand English good.
When I was about nine or ten, I viewed it again and it was then that I realized that Resident Evil is a masterpiece.
I was speechless after I seen the film, the story is truly original and one of the best thing about it is that the first 10 minutes was slow & peaceful but then it went really fast & relentless just like a roller-coaster going up slowly & zoomed down.
It begins with a nice back story and then builds slowly in pace to a climactic frenzy.
The black man chokes the surfer to death, then hauls the coffin to the mansion containing the hippies.
It's the kind of B movie classic, shown in the drive-in theaters back then.
Girlfriend walks into scene, gets a mug and glass from the cupboard, pours a coffee, then opens fridge to fill glass with orange juice, then walks out of frame.
), then characters leave, and we see an empty room again.
One of the urban gangster killers then actually slings his M-16 before hopping off the backyard deck.
They soon get mixed up with some dangerous mafia and from then on the comedy goes into overdrive.
And then there's the doctor in the asylum who goes by the name of Dr. Orlof, a name you'll find as early as 1959 (The Awful Dr. Orlof).
The stooges start first as starving artists in Paris, and then Foreign Legion soldiers (with familiar "about face" marching routines), Santa Clauses (There ain't no Santy Claus) and harem girls.
They are of course hilarious in each, and then the climax with their encounter with the lion.
I really loved the opening where they got into trouble with their rent and the police, and then they accidentally joined the Foreign Legion, and when the Capitan they were supposed to guard got captured, they then dressed up as Santa Claus in order to go and rescue him!
The woman then marries her late husband's business partner.
MacMurray then turns up alive a year later.
It then falls to the confused Vicky to decide which husband she wants.
If you wish to hear about Brook Shields mom, getting drunk at her daughters weeding, groping Kathy, molesting Kathys husband before calling the grooms mother "a really nasty word" then this is the DVD for you.
Its worth renting, seeing once, having a good laugh, then returning it to the DVD store.
In this installment, the series has gone further then to parody horror films.
Other then that there is nothing else that is worth a chuckle.
I'm also sitting here and asking myself why did they show a scene with Madsen hitting a guy and assuming his identity, then donig nothing with it.
They also draw on some great comedic acting talents, which always strikes me as a bit bizarre, but then maybe someone on the producer's team is a great salesman.
*SPOILERS* One example is for the beginning where Chingy & Dr.Phil are chained up in the same room, Chingy keeps bumping his head, then keeps "axidentally" hitting Dr.Phil over the head, by knocking down objects while trying to get a rock through a basketball hoop.
If you want a few good laughs then this is what you're looking for.
We then go to our hero from the first three, Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris), who has taken a job looking after an old lady in an old mansion.
However, if you're a fan of Scary Movie 1, 2 and 3, then how could you boycott this one?!
If this were done on purpose, if the direction taken when making this was to show how chaotic these fights were, then it would have been a good creative call.
I want Jack to die already,(sorry) so Jen and Frankie could have a chance with their marriage, and i think Jack is just spoiling it, and Maggie moves around so fast first she was on Austin's rooftop and then the next scene she is at the infamous hospital baby sitting Jack.
I would say give it a chance and you will enjoy, but if you don't like the drag and transvestite theme then steer well away.
For the third time this year comes a movie that on paper sounds like good ol' fashioned campy Nazi fun, and then turns out to be something quite a bit different than its premise, turning it in directions it really doesn't need to go.
Which he then explains later in dialog, in a much more succinct and interesting fashion.
If lots of blood and crazy behavior on a farm in dark territory inhabited by ageless creatures under the spell of a crazy guy is what rocks your boat, then welcome aboard.
It didn't help that the original title was Blood Creek then changed to Town Creek.
Uh, okay, then.)
If you like zombie films with a bit more of character development and more of a plot, then this film doesn't disappoint.
Based on the true story of how a Merchant Navy petrol tanker was abandoned and then re-boarded by some of her own crew.
And there's only ever 4 African-Americans - the super-stereotype "Vodoo priestess" Celeste; Lexie, Abe (and if there's another Af-Am male then you KNOW Lexie will have to sleep with him. )
But if they're really going to carry on airing this propaganda piece for the religious right, then I wish they would just cancel the show rather than demean the characters/actors by doing this to them!
It would be convenient to consider the narrator and his wife to be a couple who simply took their sex games too far and then got their inevitable comeuppance.
If the audience are placed within the body of Nigel as this relatively clean-cut and seemingly perfectly innocent individual, then it is for the purpose of hearing Oscar's story unfold.
He then looks all over for her--I thought writers write?-- and finally finds her waiting tables in a restaurant.
He then begins to live the life of a playboy--maybe if he had to work for a living he'd be a better writer--and "makes up for lost time."
Then it transitions into the 'naughtier' chapter, then going into the section that's most captivating: the 'can't-live-with-em-can't-live-without-em' logic of their relationship, and how it then relates to Hugh Grant's Nigel and his flawed marriage to Fiona (Thomas).
This movie is at times very erotic and then it slides down to real perversity's.
If Jean Seberg did not bring such an obsession, then consider Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.
The film begins with the camera focused on the sea and the waves, and the music with the piano playing to good effect, then an increasingly enlarging zooming shot of a porthole.
Oscar is entranced at first with her and delves into all kinds of sexual games, then his passion for her begins to subside and he rejects her and leaves her alone on a plane.
I'm saddened to see that a show that I watched from 1965-1992 and then started watching again when Steve and Matt and Mary Beth returned is still going to be so terrible.
Lana Turner is the star Douglas cultivated and then dropped, Dick Powell is the distinguished novelist who becomes a gun-for-hire screen writing hack, Gloria Grahame is Powell's opportunistic wife...and so on.
Shields gave director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) his big break in cinema, worked with him to great acclaim, and then shut him out of his dream project, a 'Gone with the Wind'-like epic called "The Faraway Mountain."
He lifted Sullivan out of obscurity, then dumped him unceremoniously in favor of better-known directors.
There hasn't been a hint of any kind of outdoor weather in the whole movie, and then in this scene all of a sudden she's in a driving rainstorm.
Now, how is it possible to publish a newspaper, for the paper to get delivered to a gas station, for somebody to see it, then to drive to the accident site, and the crash site looks like it happened minutes or hours ago???
Minnelli makes no mistakes, setting us up, then leading us one by one through the three main stories.
The vision of him in his white dinner jacket, black tie untied, collar open, holding sleeping Lana Turner and then the camera moves back to show that it's the edge of the pool and then...he drops her in...it's a priceless scene.
And then, there's the writer.
The narrative of the film is a retelling by people who knew him, a sexy but soon disillusioned actress, a director who once worked with Shields but then got cut off from him, and a writer played by Dick Powell.
Drake also talks about sleep deprivation since he found out that he is being forced to leave the show and how "It has been an incredibly difficult several weeks due to the disbelief, shock and then final acceptance and closure which is inevitable in any creative endeavor."
My childhood has coincided with our Reorganization and disintegration of the USSR and then at us information freedom, which was not in the USSR, has begun, and has appeared a lot of western, especially American, films, cartoon films, music.
I saw very many, much was pleasant to me were a favorite "Ninza Turtles", and from "ThunderCats" I then saw only one episode (about huge spiders), but they have sunk down to me in soul and later 20 years they (ThunderCats) is my favorite cartoon serial from serious (and from comic - "The Pink Panther") and I now try to extract a full serial on disks in the original (without a translation into Russian).
I left watching it for a while, cause I've been busy.. but then I got into it again.
Must've been the fad back then.
Today both these films would do very well if new and in multiplexes, then they just had a guest appearance for 6 days (closed Sunday) and off to some remote drive ins in the countryside... never on TV never on video and never heard of again.
Obviously the subtle dry wit is too complex & they prefer the sort of humour from we get from our friends across the pond, either with 3 blokes & 3 girls all living in the same penthouse apartment despite being unemployed & all in their 40's or failing that, jokes about penises in apple pies or people being sick in a frying pan then eating it.
(Sing along to the classic song "Calendar Girls")  I did not like, I did not like those "Calendar Girls" I did not like, I did not like those "Calendar Girls" It is so boring this film called the "Calendar Girls" It is the most overrated film in the 2003 world Do not watch it any day of the year  The film stars Helen Mirren as an old girl who gets her geriatric peeps to nude it out in front of the world so they can raise some funds for a couch memorial in a hospital vestibule but what we get is dreary story that quickly rans out of fuel Stay Away, Stay Away cause this is too weird   That's why I did not like the film "Calendar Girls" That's why I was turned off by the "Calendar Girls" And if you did like "Calendar Girls" then you should be sent to a place where crazy people swirl Every day, Every Day of the year  ** Needs Improvement
Go on then."
Sky One cruelly axed it and then Channel 5 picked it up - unfortunately this was only a brief period.
If this qualifies as a genre, then I for one am only too happy to see and love them all, as I love all the movies I mentioned very much.
I'm not about to debate that, but it leaves me to the following question: Why if a naked calendar is art the same way 'David' is art, then how come no one was exposed in the calendar?
If you want to understand the beginnings of what would become genocide in El Salvador in the 80s, or even just to see the commitment of a great man to the poor and actually carry out what Jesus asked then see this movie.
If there is ever to be justice in this world, and it's a big "if", then we can start by demanding that perpetrators of violence are dealt with appropriately and not allowed sanctuary and support.
When my son became infatuated with the Care Bears, I had sit through the painful Care Bears Movie (1985) a number of times, and then through some excruciating videos of episodes from the mid-80s TV show.
But then we got the DVD of Journey to Joke-a-lot, and the opening song by Jane Siberry immediately caught my attention.
Well, I'm a child of the 80's, and LOVED the Care Bears back then, and watch the TV show, saw the movies...owned a few myself.
The movie is very character driven rather then explosions and special effects rammed down your throat.
It drew me in got my interest, peaked my curiosity and then left me hanging.
and then she goes wildly crazy at the end and tries to kill everyone.
And then Mrs. Green magically pops up under Cameron's (whose character is extremely annoying in the beginning) hospital bed, unbeknownst to the medical staff who go in and out of his room at all hours of the day and night.
)And then suddenly she is lying in a hospital under Alex Feldman's bed?
I never really got into the movie until the red neck, and then it seemed to perk up the flow of the film.
But if the film is a drama, then it is basically untouchable by critics and viewers.
I had thought they had forgotten him for a long time, then they finally came back to him, and he was next to death.
His identity then was bound to the fantasy of the Jews in the garden, even though his realistic father says they are not his type.
Boy, there must have been a real dearth/scarcity of film fests back then!?
This FBI agent then becomes insanely obsessed with capturing Gus.
Of course, something like this would never happen then, but it was immensely riveting to see thousands of people disappear because of a drawing on some kid's wall.
Coming after a couple of stories , one of which is considered to be a modern classic ( The Impossible Planat/Satan Pit ) while the other ( Love And Monsters ) is one of the most radical pieces of television produced Fear Her was never going to be all that well received , but its Luke warm reception is to do mainly with the fact it's a very dull predictable story   If you watched the " next time " trailer from the previous week then you'll know in advance as to what the story is about and therefore there's no suspense .
You also can't help notice that because the plot was one of those written on the back of a cigarette packet efforts then there's so much padding centered around on dysfunctional family issues , in this case single parenthood .
It was a project where writer A came up with the concept and wrote opening, then passed it to writer B who developed it and threw in complications that would make writer C sweat bullets to resolve.
If they sucked, then you tell me why they are being sold in the stores!
It goes back and forth from Pretty In Pink to The Breakfast, and then there is Sixteen Candles.
It was really unnecessary to have the whole trapped in the store after hours and then have Connelly and Whaley held hostage.
And then there's Jennifer "Eternally Easy on the Eyes" Connelly who, yes, has her usual charms (both of them), but who manages to bring a degree of wit, grace and sincerity to the "girl next door anyone would die to get with" role that's rarely been matched since.
This is not a review of the film.This is a spoiler.Haha.To begin with...well,let me just say that Dracula can't beat Frankenstein's Monster.The original monster has the combined strength of a 100 men and,as we all know,he's INDESTRUCTIBLE!But Al didn't know that and obviously he was a Dracula fan.So,the monster became an "artificially created man" which was torn apart in the end by Dracula.If Boris Karloff was in that forest,in which the "final battle" takes place,he would have pounded them BOTH into oblivion.But fear not Frankenstein fans!There are other films(not to mention comic books)in which the monster defeats the "lord of the manner of Corpathia".If you are a Dracula fan,then enjoy this.You will never see Dracula defeating the "monster" again.But If you are a Frankenstein fan,then please avoid it.
And then there's the fight at the end.
I haven't seen the movie in a couple of years, so I can't do too good of a job explaining the storyline... then again, even if I saw it ten seconds ago, I don't think I could explain it.
I saw this on TV multiple times when I was little--loved it then.
But, then, what of the monsters themselves?
Well, if you want a quality film, then keep looking!!
However, if you enjoy laughing at incompetence, then this film has it in spades.
There are those lengthy sequences focusing on $50 lab sets with lights flashing meant to impress us and you may laugh, but then you hear the cop (Davis, better known to "Dallas" TV fans) philosophizing about how some victims ask for bad stuff to happen to them based on his 20 years experience and you may think, hm - who wrote that?
I also had to laugh when Naish describes the obvious lunatic Chaney as harmless to some guests, then sends him to chop people up in the next scene...but we knew that.
If I grasped this Dr.Frankenstein's thinking correctly, it involves causing sudden death, such as decapitation, then reviving the dead subject somehow, and creating a rare blood mixture as a result.
Dracula actually digs up the mashed-potato-monster and then makes some pact with Naish.
They then of course, delve into the mystery when not hanging out on the beach doing romantic things.
She goes to a club, is slipped LSD in her coffee, has a substandard 70s trip out scene, then teams up with three hippies (led by Anthony Eisley) to find out what's going on.
If none of those names are ringing a bell, then you may not be as amused by what you see here.
The film then switches to a beach near an amusement park in Las Vegas.
The film then switches to the Vegas strip where Jodies sister Judith Fontaine (the director's wife Regina Carrol) is a headlining act, we see her performance for a few minutes as the film becomes a low rent MGM musical.
Dracula verses Frankenstein is one of those so bad its good movies, a drive in movie.with a great cast;Lon Chaney Jr as a puppy loving murderer,j Carroll Nash as Dr Frankenstein.and Regina Carroll as the busty blonde heroine.and then there's a great extended cameo by Forrest j Ackerman(Dr. acula and to us horror fans uncle forry)OK i know a lot of critics hated this but its really an entertaining tribute to the universal Frankenstein movies,the monster looks like a brute with a face that resembles a raw steak,and Dracula looks like a hippie with fangs.also starring the great Russ tamblyn and Anthony eisley.with music from the universal monster films.troma picked up the DVD rights to this.it really is a scream.notably this was Lon Chaney Jr's last film as well as j Carroll Nash(both were in house of Frankenstein 1945) also in the cast is Jim Davis who later played jock Ewing on TVs Dallas.
If you want to sit back and enjoy the early unpretentious years of Hollywood, then this upbeat movie is for you, which showcases a young Lana Turner at her sweetest.
We would watch a great show and then boom, stupid ending.
I saw this on Lifetime sometime after it had originally aired and it dawned on me on whether or not this girl's decision would have been as difficult had this been about a girl who had been adopted and then had found her birth parents.
!What kind of crap does MTV come up with?Sure, there's your every now and then GREAT show on MTV, but usually there's dumb excuses for entertainment like The Real World aired.
If you are one of those who thinks this is a masterpiece, then you don't know what a good movie is.
The first twenty minutes were okay because it was not boring, then holy crap, the rest of the movie was flat out dreadful!
We are then supposed to sympathize with him, which we don't, because we hate him.
I've seen it three times now, my first time being over 12 years ago, and it's no easier to watch now than then.
If you believe yourself to be perceptive and intelligent enough to understand the film on most or all of its levels(I don't claim to, not at all), or even on the most basic levels, such as theme and morale(which is what I understood of it) then you should, nay, then you *need* to see this film.
And it was then that I rediscovered his greatest achievement `A Clockwork Orange.'
Now, in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, Kubrick actually brings a story about violence, and even then it is art directed within an inch of its life.
hes the deep dark place inside you that rises to the surface eventually, and then pushed down just as fast because it terrifies you.
Malcolm McDowell gives us a shining example of superior acting, and the movie is as perverted as any of Kubrick's masterpieces (and then some!).
Yes, if the state of U.S. Army was actually as it is displayed in this movie, then yes that scene would be fitting, but this is not true.
However, first there's a question of jurisdiction - was Mike killed on the street and then dragged to within the base's property line?
Anyway the movies overall is pretty good, but then some halfwit has to come up with idea of the flying the US flag upside down to show what they think of this country...That ticked me off..  You know these are the same people that live in 30,000 square foot houses with a garage full of gas guzzling cars, a few airplanes, and helicopters, tour buses, Olympic size pools, who think nothing of spending $1000 bucks for a meal they do not eat... and then campaign to get the poor smucks who make %50,000 or less a year to conserve, etc.
- Having spent a career as an HA cop, if you're chasing a Hispanic suspect, you will shout every racial epithet you can think of and then beat him senseless as soon as you catch him.
So much so any soldier can take a good friend, chop him into little pieces, burn the pieces, and then go out for a bite of fried chicken.
If you're one who's game for investigative army dramas like Courage Under Fire (Denzel Washington and Meg Ryan), The General's Daughter (John Travolta and Madeleine Stowe) and even Basic (John Travolta again, and Connie Nielsen) as I am, then it is without a doubt you will add In the Valley of Elah into your list of mentionables.
Based of the true story, shown on CBS' 48 Hours, of the late US Army Specialist Richard Davis "In the Valley of Elah" shows how those servicemen and women who are now engaged in the fighting in Iraq, as well as Afghanistan, suffer more then just from being shot bombed and ambushed by the enemy El-Qeada and Iraqi insurgents.
The murder victim turns out to be no other then Hank's long lost son Michael Deerfield!
As all the evidence mounts in not just who murdered Michael but what the circumstances were to his grizzly death it becomes apparent that he himself was more responsible for his untimely death then those who inflicted it on him!
His father Â ex army and ex military police - turns up at his son's base wanting to know what has happened, and the soldier then turns up dead, in small pieces, and apparently cooked.
Here's a thought; as a society becomes 'softer' and its sons (and daughters) are taught equality, diversity, emotional intelligence and political correctness all through their formative years, how does that society then train the killers its military wing needs for war?
Deerfield over 42 times, dismembered his body, then set fire to it.
I love how it starts as a genre movie and then transcends into something deeper and soul-searching.
And then there are all these beautiful, sentimentalist Takeshi takes, which can make even urban jungles and industrial setting look aesthetic; and the trademark over-long cuts - which are used here to underline the tension of waiting our 'heroes' are experiencing.
If masters make their art look easy then this is a great example of modern film mastery.
Takeshi's slow, lingering, minimal style could put off some viewers, but if you don't mind the more contemplative camera then you have struck gold.  
The redemption topic was then told again in Hana-bi, which managed to be an even greater movie.
Two Yogi-isms in the first scene and then we don't hear from him again.
Back then, as now, the Yankees were our hated rivals, but even so there wasn't a kid I knew who wouldn't have given everything to be Micky Mantle.
If this movie doesn't pull at your heartstrings for any reason, then consider the irony of having gone through all that Maris did to break this record and have it noted in the record book that he did it in a longer season and the final irony of having that decision reversed after his death.
Ever since then his nurse Sharona Fleming,(played by Bitty Schram) has been taking care of him.....
61* would of course become 61 and then later shattered and surpassed by another home run chase.
Then we learn that V-Day is still a few days away, then Charlie Brown goes to a school dance.
Oh, the aforementioned climber falls down a crevasse, is hanging there wearing his crampons, then is hauled out without them.
But the best indication of the real quality of this series is that, despite the many improvements made in the successive seasons, this initial effort was better than 99%+ of anything else on the tube, then or now.
Like most of Hitchcock's post-Psycho movies it should have finished him in Hollywood but then he redeemed himself with the very watchable To Catch a Thief.
If we take this film like all films by Hitchcock should be taken, that is to say as a metaphor of real life, of history, of fate, then we might be less surprised by the date.
We can un-bury it, and then bury it again, and eventually un-bury it a second time, but why not re-bury that poor past in order to finally get it out once more and discover it was not so bad and it was nothing but some kind of sad heart disease, a disease of the heart, a weak heart crushed by passions, love passion, dreams that me made into nightmares, and maybe some anger.
But then they try to forget and wipe it out to go on with the present and their lives.
And it is then that it is all revealed that human beings are as dumb as my thumb and instead of having thought and thought again and pondered, they jumped to conclusions without even thinking one second.
First, in the end, One of the last lines in the film regarding her son by Forsythe, and then his correction makes you wonder if he will be this good father.
Also look at that doctor, first so preoccupied, stumbling over the dead body twice, and not being aware, and then confronted with the police, running away, perhaps in fear of his life if he were to divulge the truth, or not wanting to get involved, which is perhaps a comment about general society.
First, a freckle-faced little boy named Arnie comes upon it, and then the rabbit-hunting Captain Wiles discovers it and thinks he carelessly shot Harry.
Sometimes it doesn't look like it should be funny, but then something else comes along- another strange line of dialog, another aside about Harry's body being moved here or there- that turns things on its head.
It's basically Hitchcock having fun with something that, for him, is probably more lighthearted then it might be for most.
It's not a totally pitch black comedy, but then again Hithcock is deceptive, devilishly so, in in making things as simple as they seem.
Basically, if you like Hitchcock, black comedy and don't mind an uncomplicated story, then I highly recommend it.
There's no doubt that The Trouble With Harry is an acquired taste; but if this taste is to your liking then you're in for a delectable treat!
That MacLaine held the screen then, and still does 50 years later (!
But if your tastes are extremely low, or you like high fat foods with no filling, then this is the perfect dish for you!
He sees her and then he has to go back to his mother's house when Jane is caught in the fur freezer vault.
He leaves and then returns to see her sing in church and all is well.
and then responded with 'About 100 minutes!
All in all an excellent movie and if TCM show then I recommend it 100%.
I've seen the miniseries at least five times since then, when it's be re-run on various cable channels.
But then I decided to finish watching and it was a disappointment!
Oh yeah, in the beginning, they will be all fairytale and lovey dovey and then of course, not to bore us out of our wits with boredom of their lovey dovey, everything is grand kind of thing, there will be somebody who wants the crown and tries to spoil it for the happy couple only weeks before the wedding.
But then, some of my college friends made better flicks than this.
then when with this movie's opening scene, the girl came out with Wig & heavy make-up with horrible eye-shadows !!!
I know Danish is a hard language to learn and to speak, the Queen of Denmark's husband doesn't even speak it that well after many years in Denmark, but then you need to employ at least A FEW Danes, instead of just teaching the actors a few words.
Soren acted way too serious then tried being the comedic relief.
A greedy, penniless cousin of the royal family who is royalty in Norway finds an old law which reads that if the prince was crowned without a bride, then his bride must be of royal Scandinavian blood or he must abdicate the throne.
She was chubby back then, but surprise!
Paige confronts Kirstin, and then the underhanded cat-fight is on, each trying to humiliate the other as much as possible.
Paige spots a tabloid picture of Eddie in which he isn't smiling as though he loves Kirstin, and then sets out for the school's law library with some friends to try to find the loophole that all the lawyers couldn't find.
As a result, we get to really know them, see what's driving them (shockingly, through their acting and the filming, and not uninteresting plot twists -- most of the intense events that drive them all took place prior to the film), and then watch how it unfolds.
If you like character driven movies, then this movie will appeal to you.
Saw this movie after the hype surrounding the many nude scenes present in the movie.The actors and some emotion looked real but then when it came to acting it out, they weren't professional enough.
For two thirds of this film I was spellbound and then it suddenly span away from me.
First you take a random porn movie off the shelf, then you replace the physically attractive but creepy-brained human beings with the super ultra low rent versions of the same people.
It's not that you can see the actress' head tracking the camera and then relaxing when it landed on her, or the splicing of the edit in the bell ringing scene, or the totally scuzzy texture and manipulatively depressing guiding hand of the story and of its director.
There're some guys here said it's had a bad ,going-to-nowhere story then they can't get the message , the reason blah blah blah , some others complained about its slowness , then some avuncular naturalist point out that these actors can be compare with a wax statue of Paris Hilton , some "critics" bring King Kong (OMG) and LOTR (WTF) to intimidate this movie , so, kiddos , go home and leave indie spirit alone !
If it does, then the film, in my view, succeeds in telling the story that it should.
Later on he stabs Ana to death and then joins a religious pilgrimage, dying on his knees in church.
Reygadas lulls us into this feeling and then slowly pans down to dissolve our preconceptions.
If you remember hearing the lyrics "You light up my life," then you should also enjoy the soaring lyrics "If ever I see you again" by the same composer.
I really could have lived without seeing a deaf child caught in a bear trap, then systematically have her eyes gouged out.
Starting out as a research project for female criminals, to "saving" an innocent prisoner then onto getting imprisoned yourself( The Professor) and the ultimate betrayals from the ones who are charged to protect people from such evils, the Attorney.
More and more very talented 'acting' is being displayed in animated films these days (wonder, then, if we'll ever see Matthew McConaughey try his hand in this genre?)..
Save your money and rent it, watch the first 45 minutes, then call it a day.
I wasn't going to be deterred,as this show neared,then opened,by the criticisms of the show,steeling myself to think that I would catch this show out of curiosity and moderately low expectations.
Basically this bee goes outside and gets caught and then there's this really boring part in the middle and some stuff happens in court.
If you recognize that that is what the filmmakers are going for, then you will enjoy it.
If you are expecting an incredible story or thrilling action or amazing animated beauty, then you might be disappointed.
I read the back and knew then that it wasn't a straight up werewolf movie but it still sounded interesting so I got it.
And if Marty isn't happy, well then something's wrong-after all, he's the man.
and then buy it to show all your friends).
teaching her to be more respectful and more caring and concern for the benefit of other people, that are less fortunate then her.
as i grew up i forgot about BaBar then after a while i began thinking about what my favorite TV show was.
And then we have Colee Dunn.
But then you look closer.
He would slaughter them, devour them and then leave the bodies for others to find.
America seems to be much less willing to address its failures now than it was then, or even the lesser failures in the wake of World War II.
America seems to be much less willing to address its failures now than it was then, or even the lesser failures in the wake of World War II.
then about 500 were seen by Don/Marty .. we had a script supervisor to help .
If you are looking for something different, then take a chance on this one.
The great locations help a bit, but since Chuck Norris isn't' exactly "The Action Star", then this is definitely not "The Movie" (ha-ha).
Chuck then says the smartest man he ever met was a homosexual.
Chuck is the only person who thinks it's mean to fire somebody, then force them to leave the premises without any pants.
He showed his skills and then some.
I'm surprised that anybody reviewing the script didn't pick up on it... but then again, the state of scientific literacy among filmmakers is often abysmal.
This was an example of the expression "jumping the shark"--it was obvious it was all downhill for the show from then until its cancellation--and with crappy episodes without the original formula, it wasn't long before the show breathed its last.
As long it has their hero beating the beans out of whoever is stupid enough to cross his path, besmirch his honor or step on his hat, then it's body check time!
All goes well until they get Chuck mad by killing just about everybody he cares for... then they step on his hat!
If you are reading this, then chances are you already know about the original BURKE'S LAW and what it is about, and as others have already written about how the storyline was updated for the 1990's.
I have a very good idea how the double exposures were created: Mary Pickford must have been photographed with her body covered in a black body stocking for both of her roles, and then two doubles - one of which may have been Mary's sister Charlotte - were photographed in costume.
After you get used to the idea of the then 29 year old Mary Pickford playing a boy, you'll find this silent film is a classic in its own right.
If you're one of those people who quite enjoyed "La Pacte des Loups" (Brotherhood of the Wolf) a few years back but were left disappointed by some of the more ridiculous historical inaccuracies, then you might want to take a look at Romasanta.
People may have trouble with the sentimental story and tone, but if you accept the tale then you should have no complaints as to its manner of telling.
Kristen makes a deal that if she can get one of the families back on the nice list then it will prove that there is hope for mankind and Santa won't quit, but she has to do this before midnight on Christmas Eve so she has to work fast.
Christmas is about to be canceled because there's a majority of children out there who have been more naughty then nice and Santa Claus (Campbell) is deciding to go away on vacation putting his oldest daughter Rudolfa (Haskell) in charge.
However his younger daughter Kristen (Ireland) doesn't like that plan one bit, she makes a deal with dad that if one family's name is returned to the "nice list" then Christmas will go on as planned.
On the way to the new town, Romasanta kills his 'girlfriend' and her daughter and then returns to seduce BÃ¡rbera.
The chief then ended the scene with a pathetic excuse for a salute to George Cowley, well you might as well carry the unbelievably to the end.
It begins with a man killed in a pharmacy and a woman who accidentally witnesses the murder and then of course, she's a target.
Far from essential then, but definitely worth at least checking out for genre completists or those particularly curious about it.
The plot seems interesting for two seconds there but then suddenly Roberts starts pulling a gun and stuff and the movie just keeps getting worse and worse.
The FBI, or whatever it's called in this movie, try to let everybody think he gets captured, and then gets free again to improve his popularity.
But then some terrorists real capture him, and it's up to "The Replacement", or "The guy in the tuxedo" to rescue him.
It goes to another angle, and then we only see his face.
Unfortunately, then finding out that the President didn't authorize anything and that it is the Cia and then not really the CIA and that Eric Roberts is some anti gravity, bullet dodging hero ends any  integrity the movie started out with.
The effects are ridicules, especially the weapons effects the Special Forces in the beginning of the movie are firing m-16s at the attackers but they seem to hit none, zero then finally they hit the attackers keep in mind that they are using full auto and they are facing each other!!!
but the worst scene was when the attackers moved in a small room and the special forces attacked them by entering the room firing rapidly with their m16s and some how they did not hit anyone then the attackers used a smoke grenade to push the special forces outside the small room.
i got it and when i put it in and it was beautiful the graphics were amazing and searching for the colossus was awesome also the environment was really interactive which was cool the game play was unique and fun and the battles and how you had to find out how to kill them were awesome also the story was the best each colossi was unique and different to kill and the story was a shocker (if you have played Ico then you might have guessed that this game is Ico prequel) this game really pushed the play stations limits though the game is short but it is unforgettable if you have never played this get it and if you have any doubts don't classic 10/10
If your'e expecting something like "The Legend of Zelda", then forget it.This is a different type of game than an average adventure game, and if you've the slightest interest in alternative gaming you must give it a go.
But then, the movie is sure to point out, not all puzzlers are geeks.
The second part - the largest segment - is devoted to USA Crossword Championships held in each in Stamford, Conn. We see the top players profiled and then are witness to the 200- tournament with it's dramatic 3-person playoff finals.
He then proceeds to torture her, concluding that his lust can only be the result of her "bewitching" him.
It leads you to the edge, pulls back, and then climaxes.
However, if you can track down another copy of it off ebay, and you like cheesy, tongue in cheek slashers, then give it a look.
Some of the gore is okay; there's a few scenes where a dude or two suffers genital injuries during oral sex, but the camera cuts to the dudes facial expressions of pleasure then pain, and then the chick spitting blood.
The movie's about this wannabe satanist, who gives incantations to Satan while sitting at his bedside wearing his Def Leppard t-shirt, then dreams of this ugly chick who is supposed to be Satan incarnate, or a succubus.
So there you have it, if this sounds exciting to you or you like watching people getting tortured then The Pit and the Pendulum is the film for you, as for me I liked it but mostly because of Hendriksen & it's torture scenes.
There is nothing bigger than figuring out who you are, and then take action accordingly.
Jennifer follows in dad's footsteps in many ways, but then she hits a time in life where different perspectives are kicking in - with a harshness.
To then patronise?
It is easy to see her as a wide-eyed American, flying in for a three-hour tour of the horrific Asian brothel, then telling us her amazing facts as if she was the first person to discover them.
If you are a viewer of dark movies, then you would like this adaption of Edgar Allan Poe.
From there, someone kills a doctor, and then kills someone in the hospital's parking garage, stealing his car.
If you judged every director on only the one title, then your DVD shelf would be a very lonely place.
Once outside the complex, the psycho makes short work of a cheery pharmaceutical salesman and then flees the scene in the dead guy's car.
The (unconvincingly) hysterical Linda is then dragged off of the boat by two orderlies who don't seem at all concerned by the fact that Vargas has just been fatally impaled on the huge spike.
If you don't manage to work out the unseen killer's identity by the half hour mark then you shouldn't be watching anything that's not PG-13 rated.
And the relationship between Eddie & Mo, yeah, it is definitely more realistic then the characters of "Pretty Woman" to put it mildly!.
The choice that Mo makes at the end didn't surprise me that much because by then one could see the ties that bind this couple were stronger for Mo, then anything else.
But in spite of the positives I wouldn't give it higher then a 7.
I'd give this a 7, not because I loved it but for the reasons mentioned above and will freely admit this movie stayed with me after longer then I would have thought it would.
She seems to adore him, but then it becomes clear that she also is using him.
If you find watching an innocent-looking little girl swear & drink beer humorous then you'll probably like the movie.
Well if your idea of a comedy is watching a woman get drunk, get beat up, almost raped, live with a psychopath, turn him in to protect him from himself and others, give birth to their child alone, re-marry a guy who's filled with as much rage as the 1st hubby, and then, when the 1st hubby returns, leaves her 3 kids and 2nd hubby without so much as a "I'm gonna miss you" - then this is your kinda a comedy.
What really gets me is that all the reviews described this movie like this: Hip Comedy about a woman who remarries after her 1st hubby goes to jail, and then 10 years later when he is released must choose between the 2.
Well that part about the 1st hubby going to jail doesn't happen until more than an hour into the story, and by then you have figured out that it is a no-brainer - she will always go with this guy, no matter who else she marries - even if it's John Travolta.
And then the mom LEAVES WITH EDDIE!!!!
SHe has been married to this guy for 10 years, has cleaned up her life and was living in a wonderful house and had a wonderful life, and then she leaves(leaving her husband of 10 years and her kids behind!!
I kept waiting for this movie to begin and then the credits began to roll.
It's surprising then, that she seems to have been in only two films.
Maureen tells Eddie she wants to smash bottles over peoples heads and then adds, "Because I love you."
They then travel for awhile with the one horse hitched to the wagon.
So then she's riding the horse, which he is leading.
i loved it then and long to see if my memories of it have held up over the years.
Surprise, surprise, they then run into murder.
This film has developed something of a reputation over the years (but then so has Arsenic and Old Lace, from the following year).
It's not the mystery being clever that makes this such a good movie, but then The Thin Man movies are not known for their Mystery stories either; it is the byplay between the husband and wife that makes the movie so very enjoyable.
I remember it being in the theater for maybe one week and then going to video, and the only reason I even knew it existed was from reading Fangoria.
I saw this for the first time when I was six or seven, and the memory of it really stuck with me, since we didn't have too many TV programs in Romania, back then.
Anyway, if you want to see one book adaptation, then see this one!
He could have had a farm, like there are many for animals, and raise little children which he would be feeding until they got fat enough an then slaughter them and sell their meat.
The quirky(for lack of a better word) characters and the great dark humour is not for everyone, but if you can appreciate it then you won't be disappointed.
If you really liked Amelie then you might also like this.
We later find that the reason for this is that this particular delicatessen hires handymen and keeps them long enough to fatten them up, and then they are eaten by the delicatessen's butcher and the inhabitants of the apartment building in which they live.
The result - silly and terminally juvenile - is a disappointment: besides wasting a good cast (Daniel Massey, Michael Gothard and Cyd Charisse), the sci-fi trappings of the plot are ill-suited to the material; the hokey monster effects, then, seal the fate of this low-budget venture.
The film then switches to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean during the Victorian period.
The Octopus still looks quite good now and the effects were good for then 1978.
But Blade is bored, then suddenly a kung fu teaching angel; "Bruce" appears.
Blade then teaches the kids his kung poo, and that's about it - coupled with poorly staged fights along the way.
Again, if you can't find this funny, then I feel sorry for you... stop taking yourself so seriously!
I enjoyed it then, and I still enjoy it today.
Despite the over the top premise, then film spends it's opening act to develop the characters, something that in todays special effect overdose, seems to have been greatly lost.
If you are simply looking for a movie that intends to do nothing more then be entertaining for the viewer, this is perfect for you.
But then again, DESPERADO was so much better than EL MARIACHI, yes?
He screws his daughter who's a runaway prostitute, then later gets beat over the head with a rock by a mysterious stranger.
If they have to dismember total strangers in order to "be a family again," then we don't WANT them to "be a family."
She's also into heroin, but then later when something happens particular-like with Q, another unnerving revelation is revealed, one without really any explanation for being there.
And then... the laughter starts.
The father then realizes the camera has been on throughout.
We have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter (she's upset with him because he came too quickly)and ends by murdering his female colleague, having sex with her corpse, and then chopping her up.
We saw this lousy movie, then put on "Zero Woman, The Accused."
Miike apparently has some thing for mother's milk, too, if you've seen Gozu then you know what I mean.
Heck, when the movie starts out you think they are all different stories, then, slowly you start to realize that this people are all related and living in the same house hold.
At first I was worried by the use of video as it normally seems cheap and crappy but then I noticed the angles that the director was employing and his abundant technique.
Again I feel myself wishing to be in Laura's shoes - but then again maybe not...
One starts watching, thinking will it be worth it, I haven't seen it for years, and then click!
Mike and Laura start out associating by accident and then by design.
Still, once Lacy makes headway into Garland's fascinating movie career, she has a tendency to then double-back and give us more of the old stuff.
We are to understand that the Garland-Gene Kelly musical "The Pirate" was a box-office flop, but are then told a moment later that Garland was nothing short of movie-gold.
MGM bled her dry and then blamed her for not being a bottomless tank of gas.
If you like movies that are crime dramas basically then you will like Bullethead.The dialogue was great in the movie and I found it very refreshing seeing a movie that did not have to rely on a bunch of special effects to captivate the audience.
Revenge then becomes the film's cardinal motif as Joe, along with his cohorts and his enemies, all go on the attack during scenes of wildly escalating violence.
Whatever the reason, when you name your leading character "Meaney", portray virtually all the characters in a realistic style and then have the main character turn into a tree, then you've got a melange that sinks under the woven strands of too many stylistic ideas.
Unless you really don't have anything else do do like operating on yourself with a worn out spoon, then do not see this BORING movie.
"Believers" is your very average end of the world/suicide cult movie if not for the fact that it was directed by Daniel Myrick, one half of the director duo behind "The Blair Witch Project", if only Mr. Myrick had used one half of his brain too then this might not have ended up such a total mess.
We then enter the conversion phase where they try and convince them, indeed this is the main part of the movie.
As the Chief comes to find his men the garage attendant uses a monkey wrench to disable the radio Â which part of this cult of elite scientists did he belong to Â and then takes out the chief who manages to miss a huge fire vehicle in a garage at point blank range for longer than any normal human.
On return to the cells Dave fails to use the cistern lid again and then tells them to stitch Victor's bullet wound Â a puncture wound shouldn't be stitched.
Victor then falls for the old conversion by sex routine (the girls mother and general titillation for some watching) and Dave finally after another pathetic attempt to break from his cell finally does what the audience wants and uses the cistern lid.
The four wheel drive vehicle then gets stuck in dirt.
i can't think of a good reason to watch this, unless maybe i had a friend playing a part, but then he/she would never hear the end of it.
they came, kicked back, and then vanished.
that dispatch a couple of the convicts right there and then.
If they were mummies they didn't look like mummies and I never heard of blood sucking mummies and if they vampires, then why were they running around during broad daylight?
If you want to see a bunch of people and monsters killing and being killed, then this is for you.
It seems the people writing the script thought of "cool" ideas for a 30 minutes movie and then just filled in the rest with meaningless nonsense.
It's starts like a action/criminal movie, and then, in some dark bar, it suddenly turns into a horror type of thing.
Furthermore, metal or hard-rock (whatever it's called) music is louder then spoken words which made me have to use the volume button more often.
For a few minutes it thinks it's a crime thriller , then decides it's going to be a kitchen sink drama , then gets up on its soap box to scream what a terrible place modern Britain is .
And then it happens.
Now, if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic Poe tale, then you'll be disappointed.
I think I found the movie and if I am right this take place on Christmas a boy was bothered and chased by boys from his class in school and they chaseed this boy into an abandon building while he found a stray cat and he took car of the cat by feeding it and taking care of the cat and then 1 day the kids from his class happen to do something to him at the cat and somehow at the end of this movie this boy ended up having a cat at his home  this movie i saw when I was a little boy in camp and I also saw it on hbo cinemax but I never knew the name and I been asking lots of people until now and I think this movie is the movie I been trying to look for years and I thought it came out in the 1970's since it is in color.
It has a tear-jerker near the end, but then a happy ending with a small surprise.
I can't add much more then what's already been said about this lost treasure.
I started searching the net a few days ago and found this site, then found out where you get a DVD.
They used to show it every year for about 5 or 6 years or so, then it vanished.
when it was originally shown on CBS Saturday, December 13, 1969 (I was then 7 years old); I kept hearing about the show when promos were run during my favorite CBS Saturday morning shows, so I decided to see what all the hype was about.
during Religion class (they obtained a 16mm film of the show from Carousel Films, Inc. in New York City; back then, VCRs were still in their infancy).
When I first saw My Cousin Vinny, I then realized the difference in those movies that were done pre-2000, and those done today is like comparing a juicy orange to a glass of rancid milk.
Too many Hollywood comedies get hung up on the initial inspiration and then end up flat.
But then Pesci, as Macchio's cousin Vinny, arrives in town to defend the kids.
This is one of the rare movies in comedy that i could watch over and over again,, this movie is sooooo , freaking funny it's like a laugh a minute,, especially how Vinny,, "bag of donuts" is woken up constantly every morning,, first the train,, then the pigs i think the owl, and o yeah the steam whistle... i can relate to that stuff, and living relatively close to N.Y. for years i can relate to the accents in the movie,, very Brooklyn if i'm not mistaken,, i loved Joe Pesci in this movie,, this is one of his finer moments ever in a comedic role,, Marissa Tomei however stole the whole show for me,, not only is she sexy and pretty she can act too, her accent fits her like a glove, Ralph Maccio,, hmm well, not everything can be perfect.. i Loved Fred Gwynne the judge,, he is so hilarious,, i just bust out every time he gets Vinny on Contempt of Court or something,, and order him to some jail time,, overall the plot was simple... yeah some of it's corny,, i guess you kinda have to be a Pesci, Tomei fan to appreciate all the slapstick,, but hey it's one of the funniest movies that you'll ever see and you won't regret watching it that's for sure,,
Launer has also written things that at first appear throwaway at the time like eating grits at a diner but then incorperates them into the plot later on .
If not a sequel, then more film(s) together.
Until then I have my memorys and the cartoon , for now that will have to do.
Jokes like Ollie checking the time and spilling his drink down his shirt seem old now, but were possibly reasonably new then (and still considered good enough to be homaged 43 years later in The Young Ones).
Do you put one person in through that door, then have him come downstairs and open the main door for you to bring in the piano?
It was embarrassing to watch L&H play-acting through the dopey one-liners, saying things they would never say in their own world, and the forced emotional responses dictated by the script; then right after a poor moment I would be charmed their perfect timing and naturalness with a bit of physical comedy or some of their own dialogue.
So all the way through I was about to cover my eyes, and then I'd have to laugh.
But only we most dedicated of followers would even notice this, and even then some of us don't mind as long as we can laugh a bit (which we still do).
It is then, surprising, the path both decided to follow politically.
If you remember being a child confused about the 'grown ups' around you, then this film is worth watching.
You can only watch Plan 9 once or twice then you realize it just sucks.
If you want to waste your time and money on the so called "Blockbusters" with no heart and no sense of adventure, then by all means waste it.
A pile of pompous, pretentious c**p. Oh, wait, it must be "artistic" then.
Oh, wait, then it must be "art", right.
I'm quite the sucker for films with con jobs, or about con-men going about designing elaborate ruses to rip off their mark, and then riding off into the sunset with their ill gotten gains.
Mark Ruffalo and Adrien Brody play the titular brothers Stephen and Bloom, who together with mute-by-choice Japanese sidekick Bang Bang (Rinko Kikuchi) who's anything but quiet, take on the world as confidence tricksters, milking the rich for some of their spare change by entering their lives, setting up the game plan, executing it to a tee, then disappearing, more often than not with Death roped in so that they could get away scot free.
Stephen, the more inventive one of the duo (or rather, the one that will whip up a plan with a quirk or two not unlike Owen Wilson in Bottle Rocket), devises the first con to be that of intriguing the hell out of a group of kids- first part introducing Bloom to a girl, which he likes right away- and then leading to a cave that tricks them all into believing something is there which, of course, is not.
Then there's the complications, of romance between Bloom and Penelope, and the complication that she's let in on Stephen and Bloom being "artifact smugglers", then the appearance of a certain nefarious figure known as "Diamond Dog", and meanwhile their Silent Bob figure, Bang Bang (Rino Kikuchi), tags along as someone who we only find out late in the game of the story that she has a cell phone (?)
The girl then removes the three arrows, whispers her fortune to the old man, and then the old man whispers the fortune to his patron.
It's not like you see a Stanley Kubrick film, and then say it is OK but is not as good as Doctor Strangelove.
The basic question is then whether the old man will be able to prevent her from falling in love with this young guy.
What goes wrong then?
First we are shown the man's skill with the bow, then we see how the girl's spatial knowledge of the boat and archery skills can serve as a second layer of defense.
At first, Rocky doesn't comprehend the powers that have been granted to him and even seeks professional help to make the unbearable headaches go away, but then he gradually learns how to control his skills and use it against the people he doesn't like, like his own wife who's in the way of his love affairs.
The story was very good and if you're not Romanian you should search for a subtitle in your language then look at the movie!
I want to invite everyone to see it and then judge.
His best friend then drags him to L.A. with the intent of becoming actors.
Standing up for bullied loner Jason, both in school and after, Kyle rescues his new friend from multiple classmate antagonists and then goes on to beat up the older brothers of the attackers.
Harrowing car chases, aerial stunts, crash landings, and more abound in The Flyboys, and as each scene of action attempts to outdo the previous one, we realize caution has been thrown to the wind - and then caught, beaten, and thrown out again.
See this film then spread the word.
Why then have the studios taken a pass on distributing a film which, in my opinion, would not only be commercially successful, but critically praised as well?
at least, it was that way for me during the first couple of minutes but then i realized it was more about the man behind the cars.
This is the story of Ferrari, his personal life and the way he started as a racing driver and then founded the Ferrari company.
God I used to love McDonalds back then too.
Suburban Commando is a very good film and its one of Hulk Hogan`s best films.It is one of My favorite films.I was thrilled when it came out because back when wrestling was wrestling it was so fun watching the then WWF Prime Time Wrestling show and seeing the promotions on it while watching some of the best wrestling ever seen back in 1991.Anyway the film is action packed and has many,many funny moments.One of My favorite actors Christopher Lloyd stars along with the Hulkster and he is very good in it.Christopher Neame had a very short part and I think he should have had a much larger role in the film.William Ball,Shelley Duvall,Roy Dotrice,and Larry Miller all put on good performances.I was amazed to see Mark Callaway (The Undertaker) in the film.
The film has good effects,good music and is an enjoyable film.If you like Hulk Hogan and Christopher Lloyd and love action,comedy,sc-fi action then see this film!
If you are willing to set aside your critical attitude and accept this movie for what it is- a funny, escapist entertainer- then you will love this movie.
I believe this movie went to theaters shortly and then was immediately sent to Video because the studio knew this was not a bad film.
If you like the CSI type shows then stay home and watch your favorite one of those because it will be more interesting than this flick.
The last shot is of Dushku strapped down in a mental hospital, completely ga ga, and then the epilogue -- the notorious alphabet killer has never been caught and remains at large -- thus clearing the way for a SEQUEL to this meretricious rubbish.
http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/  If you ever cross paths with Rob Schmidt or Tom Molloy, the director and screenwriter of The Alphabet Killer, then take the opportunity to insult their intelligence, the way they did yours for claiming their movie, The Alphabet Killer, is based on a true story.
What a great way to end the first season of the x-files.An apparent unrelated.minor car chase leads the agents to the discovery of what seems to be concrete evidence of a government conspiracy.The early sequence of the man being chased who then is shot emits green blood which has toxic properties is a classic.Also Deep Throat plays an important part i this episode though can the agents trust him after his lies in E.B.E?A stunning moment happens when Mulder enters the warehouse and before his very eyes is bodies in tanks of water.When he returns with Scully the bodies are gone much to Mulders disgust.He thought he had irrefutable,indisputable proof.This episode must be watched!
Jeanette always looks stunning in color and black and white films if you like Jeanette Macdonald then watch this film other then that nothing special really.
The main actor has gotten even fatter then previously, and now takes about 2/3 of my widescreen TV.
Steven Seagal has come out with an array of DTV titles since 2003's The Foreigner and none since then have been very successful in winning over many action fans.
The plot is very simple: group of mercenaries are betrayed on a mission by their boss, mercenaries are then blackmailed into taking another mission, mercenaries get mad, mercenaries get even.
I missed Submerged, Today you die and black Dawn, but then good reviews started to flood in for this movie.
And from then on it seems he can function only with a fresh corpse.
Add to this fact he is not doing his own stunts, fighting or even dialogue, then clearly many fans are getting annoyed.
The film uses corny jokes and a poke at America every now and then.
I would rather get injection into the base of my finger nails then watch one second of this "film" which is in true poor taste and form.
I would rather get injection into the base of my finger nails then watch one second of this "film" which is in true poor taste and form.
But more then funny, it's down-right clever.
To be certain its the sort of thing thats been done before, but even then this has some genuine shivers and some creepy moments.
We see unstated confusion and conflict between the doctor and his son regarding his mother and then marital tension, loving tension, between the Gibbs when the mother comes home.
If you like Maria de Medeiros here and in Pulp Fiction, then seek out the small Spanish, Film Goldenballs.
A film full of erotic experiences, Anais and Hugo, her husband, then with June, experiencing a lesbian relationship and finally with Henry... She was eager to have new experiences, and she did it.
If the movie suddenly got terrific in the last half hour, then I apologize to everyone for misleading them.
Instead, the film focuses on (then) newly revealed excerpts from Anais Nin's diary.
Kevin Spacey is amusing in what now looks like a cameo, but then was quite an important role for him.
April 20 in NY and then it moves around the country.
The movie version of the play (directed by Frank Capra) expanded the philosophy of enjoying life into another assault on the super-rich, with Edward Arnold as Mr. Kirby...not as a stockbroker as he is in the play or in this video production, but as a banker and empire builder, who gets emotionally twisted and lost, and then finds himself again.
If you enjoy movies along the lines of 'Wall Street,' 'Boiler Room' and ' Glengarry Glen Ross' and 'The Bank,' then I think you will enjoy 'The Bet' ('The Bet on Bet').
The writer/producer Caroline Gerard raised the funds entirely from the private sector and then set about assembling a top rate team of cast and crew who have delivered a remarkable ensemble effort.
A timely topic now as well as then.
There is plenty of sex and violence and if that's your bag, then Shaft in Africa is your movie.
Hold on , it`s an admirable film despite the flaws , in many ways THE EMARALD FOREST is the type of film Steven Seagal would have made if he had any talent , it`s a film that doesn`t talk down to the audience unlike nearly every eco-thriller made and does make the point that when everyone you love and everything you survey is in mortal peril then violence is the only way you can defend yourself .
Basically, what you have here is the end result of assigning a group of high school students to write a parody for a comedy class, and then injecting them with aphrodisiacs.
There was one part in the movie I thought was funny (I think at this point I would have found anything funny) was a scene where the bad wizard was killing Smirnoff the wizard by putting him under a blanket and then farting under the blanket.
With out a doubt, this little flick is funny then most, and way more erotic, then much of anything that has come out of Hollywood in the last few years.
I thought that it was an absurd load of hokum then and it certainly hasn't improved with age.
If indeed it was based on true events then the producer/director has been a bit careless with the some of the facts.
This film was lacking that spark, the songs were poorly constructed and the actors uninspiring, if you liked Rocky Horror & Little Shop of Horrors then avoid this, the values those films had aren't here.
God Bless Mr Arkin to not have any pride when he made this film (I don't see how he could have, such a big gamble) But then again I had not heard of it until a couple weeks ago.
The script keeps dropping in bits of social satire and commentary; the evil villain's plot is essentially the inverse of "white flight", seeking to "purify" New York by luring all the minorities to the suburbs and then killing them.
The film begins with a scene that sees a man carrying the body of a dead girl before burying her, and then being pursued by a bunch of people with guns.
Something about the story then: An American architect works in south America, on the border of the Amazon, One day his young son is kidnapped by indians....cant tell you more.
"You see," she tells them, "a man can meet two, three or four women and fall in love with all of them, and then, by a process of interesting elimination, he is able to decide which he prefers.
We start the movie with a mÃ©nage a trois, but one which turns into a duet with George and then a duet with Tom.
Hollywood wouldn't make movies this adult and amusing until the Fifties, and even then the level of sophistication and respect for the audience, in my opinion, never fully recovered.
Every now and then it's possible to come across in pre-Code Hollywood films of such mature pleasure you hope others will like them, too.
It's a charming albeit pretty frank theme expertly handled by Lubitsch, slyly toying with his audience as usual, though I suppose if he could come back today and re-make it that any charm would be lost in graphic scenes of sex and violence Â back then it was discipline that was required instead.
This really is a great movie from 1933 and very ahead of its time.A young woman who is in love with two friends and is obviously sleeping with both of them must have shocked a more prudish audience back then i think it had been censored for a while.But never mind we can view it today knowing that there are a lot of gems like this one waiting to be rediscovered,its a shame that so many of the films made from this era are now lost.A modern audience wouldn't turn away from this film,as you don't expect a film from this era to be saucy and it is.Gary Cooper was a very nice actor and you can see why he was so popular back then,he had a very unusual style of being very masculine and at the same time very sensitive,he was great at picking the more complex roles,his characters weren't as one dimensional as most actors of this era.He was easily one of the most interesting actors of the 30s,this i would say was his best era in films.Unfortunately A Farewell To Arms is the only film you can buy in the UK from this era,i don't know why.Its sad that he is becoming a forgotten actor,i think we must have lost our imaginations a bit as we keep harbouring on with the John Waynes and the Cary Grants,and forget there were other classic actors around that don't deserve to be forgotten yet.
if you're in the mood for a really messed up, yet really good movie, then this is your choice for the night.
If you enjoy movies like Pulp Fiction, or Get Shorty, or Fargo, or Snatch, then see THOSE movies.
the way this movie begins is very odd, but then again, so is the movie, but it's a GOOD odd.
I apologize if I have offended any of you who felt the TV rendition was even worse then what I indicated above...!
I saw the original "High Noon" more then 100 times.
If only a few words or a single phrase could convey how completely vacuous this movie is, then this review would definitely be paragraphs shorter and most likely contain a few expletives.
He then missed Will Kane and Ben Irons sitting still at a closer distance, several times.
I tried to describe the content of the movie to a friend, and we both ended up laughing because I could only stammer things like "well then the winter comes, and then spring, and then there's an eagle, and a river, and one time it is dark, and the girl goes into a cave, and another time the fox has babies" and so on.
And then the little girl begins to domesticate the fox, which leads to tragic events.
Days turn to weeks, and then the summer disappears, turning to fall and then winter, promting some superb cinematography of the sweeping, white winter landscape.
As an impressionable, short attention spanning eight year old, I loved about the first half hour -- then I lost interest.
Well I'd wait for the DVD for a wet Sunday afternoon in then.
The Italian cannibal/zombie genre has some real masterpieces and serious pieces like Ruggero Deodato's harrowing 1979 masterpiece Cannibal Holocaust that is as important and topical in its message about humanity and media than it was back then.
Favorite scene: During the courtship ritual, Tomme is given a club and is supposed "knock out" his girl in front of the villagers and then carry her off into the forest.
If you love the classic Italian zombie and cannibal movies of the 70s and 80s, then be sure to catch Cannibal Apocalypse (but make sure to see the uncut version!!!).
I remember always looking thru the horror sections of severel video store here in melb and seeing the palace video cover of this and thinkin na this looks crap but i then saw the trailer on another horror video and was sold this is an hidden gem i mean if your got john saxon and john morghen in the same movie it has to be good.Check out the region 1 dvd of this with the great doco with interviews with saxon and morghen and antonio margeretti.
And then there's just the story, which covers the first days of a viral outbreak as it begins to spread and people begin to wake up to what is going on, which is also pretty fascinating.
He explodesÂand then the funky disco music begins!
She then reveals herself as an unhinged psychotic while blowing him (um, with the dryer) while he's trying to have an important phone conversation (with another unhinged psychotic), which would earn a punch in the mouth from me (but I am not susceptible to nubile vixens).
There was something in the air then, and it seems to have returned.
You'll have to get past the silly & inept Vietnam opening-scene, but then this movie turns into an urban tale of virus-outbreak.
So if you're tired of all those "half naked cannibals eating human flesh and slaughtering animals in the jungle"-flicks, and if Umberto Lenzi's "Nightmare City" (1980) just made you laugh instead of anything else, then go watch Antonio Margheriti's "Cannibal Apocalypse" (aka "Invasion of the Flesh Hunters").
If i was any of the actors in the film i'd be rather ashamed but then again it could be just for the money.
If your a person who's seen it or is thinking of seeing it first read the book>scare your pants reading it>then watch the film>get board and see that the only thing close from the book is just the bloody title.
However, if this is the only Hammer film you've ever seen, then you'd be forgiven for thinking otherwise.
If so, why does it then get sacrificed?
Why does one of them then bleed herself to death?
The Satanic orgies are the most explicit and realistic the studio ever produced, and in addition to these there's a plethora of gratuitous female nudity, and then Â yet again Â we come to that ghastly, deformed baby.
If one is steeped in the occult traditions, then this movie is not for you because of its glaring errors - all made up by the afore mentioned screen writer.
Otherwise, the mood of the picture is quickly set by Richard Widmark's,  "98% of so called satanist are nothing but pathetic freaks who get their kicks out of dancing naked in freezing church yards and use the devil as an excuse for getting some sex, but then there is that other 2%, I'm not so sure about them."
If GTA: Vice City is the Lego Technic of road rage games then Simpsons: Road Rage is, without a doubt the Lego Duplo.
Back then they had to rely on a plot to get the audiences attention.
Start out with the Puzzle series that began in 1936 with A Puzzle for Fools, then on with A Puzzle for Players, ...for Puppets, ...for Warriors, ...for Fiends, ...for Pilgrims.
For you stoogeheads who haven't seen this short, but have seen (and watched repeatedly) the original version 'CORNY CASANOVAS', then stick to watching that one and don't waste your time on this clunker.
The looping in this film is very obvious for some reason - at least on television, some of the sound was fuzzy and then boom!
As luck would have it her Uncle happens to be an actor in a show produced by the Van Heflin character and then things start to get sticky.
My daughter, then, 9 or 10, was curious about the Santa thing, she was definitely asking questions.
It may be slightly on the guy side of the chart, but for anyone that likes a little cheese now and then (especially if you were a young teen in the 80's), check this one out.
its just a fun movie to watch with the actors in it that have made more of a name for themselves now than they did then.!
Back then as a child I wanted a Turbo Interceptor, now as an adult I want one even more....BRILLIANT!
This film is really like High Planes Drifter meets The Road Warrior,being it combines classic revenge western with action road rage films.My only complaint is that the dialouge could have been much deeper and more serious but then again,this was never meant to be Shakespeare.Randy Quaide needed more screen time as well.All in all ,however,this one is 100 times better than any of those bloated,computer created dumb kiddy rides like Fast and The Furious or Tourque.This is a real road rage film.
First off, it stars Martin Sheen's son, John Cassavetes's son, Ron Howard's brother (Clint Howard sports a crazy hairdo and plays the only intelligent member of the gang), and Dennis Quaid's brother (Randy Quaid plays the sheriff and was noticeably leaner back then).
Speaking of weight, women in movies were meatier back then; check out Sherilyn Fenn in her waitress outfit (or in another scene)!
I was shocked.Anyway The movie is about a young guy Jake Kesey (Played By The then unknown Charlie Sheen) who has been killed by a gang of street racers lead by Packard Walsh (Played by Nik Cassavetes).
During the course of such a spectacle, the audience must then ultimately ask itself, will we be able to handle the power contained in rest of this film?
You don't watch a Carry On movie and then say "Oh, that was quite unrealistic, and the acting is bad."
If your true love is stupid teens and tired horror clichÃ©'s then steer clear.
If your love for zombies is insatiable then you could do a whole helluva lot worse than Dead Life.
Who would find a zombie eating one of their neighbors and then casually start f#@king it in the ass?
take that guy, give him a camera, ten extras and ten dollars budget, and you get this movie...  only worthwhile if you're seriously drunk and wasted, and even then, it's a questionable draw (and i rented it for free!
this zombie movie was just corny,and made no sense.It was also so slow the jokes were just hours long and the dialogue was cut and so slow this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen by far.Mostly I never read ratings and decide if the movie is bad or not on my own but this was one of those cases when you should.There's bad and there's horribly stupid disgusting waist of time and this is past that.The makeup was horrible and was more of a porno then a zombie movie,The acting was the worst i have ever seen, a 5 year old could do better.Wow I'm still disgusted on how horribly bad this movie is blah!blah!blah!
But if you like really edgy comedy, then you'll dig this.
I caught this brilliant short at Dragon Con last summer and then rediscovered it at AtomFilms.com.
Another reviewer said it wasn't funny at all but then he made a comment about how Kung Pow also tried to use bad dubbing to a humorous effect and critics didn't like.
I used to think Hitchcock was a master, then I saw what Bill Hicks could do.
By then, everyone is aware of his attempts with Marie- Louise, and all his well-worn (and previously successful lines) are repeated with laughter by his friends, by the women he has seduced and in some cases even by those he didn't.
Paul's dream starts to come true, Dorothy receives a bracelet from Curtis, he hears a very loud concerto and then faints.
Brett's first plan is to convince Virginia to marry him and then to have Paul committed to a sanatorium.
The movie starts a bid slow at the beginning but once you start to confuse why the son is doing all the crap then it takes off.
Barrington seemed to have vanished and then popped up and commit crimes almost at will all across the American Southwest.
Having to get rid of Paul but not until Brett is legally married to Virginia Brett and Professor Muhlbach plan to have Paul committed in his sanitarium and then have an "Accident" that will put his searching for the truth, about his dead father, to an end once in for all.
Mind twisting movie with a surprise ending that will more then just surprise.
The "mystery" is well-shrouded throughout the film and not revealed until fairly late in the film, although there's plenty of strange goings-on to keep your interest until then.
If I want to watch a more sophisticated movie then I am looking for different qualities, but this is good family entertainment with no explanation needed.
But then the old men show up.
Bringing in the sons of those three musketeers, then their fathers plus D'Artagnan himself, gives a nice glow to the story.
Jim Evers is victim to the standard negative movie father cliches: He works too hard providing for the family that he neglects them, then bumbles his way trying to make amends for this.
If you have a family with kids, who don't have nightmares too easily, then I recommend this film.
All supporting cast do a wonderful job and the direction gives it those scenes that'll make you jump then laugh.
But then suddenly Vishnu starts behaving out of character, his drunken bouts and acts causing the father much shame and embarrassment.
Unfortunately they get more then they bargained for as creepy incidents occur around every corner and the entire mansion itself seems to be hiding a disturbing secret.
Stamp, who is most famous for his role in The Princess Bride, could have been used in a more humorous way then he was here but the filmmakers fail to do so.
If you are looking for another Pirates of the Caribbean, wait for the film's sequel rather then searching for it in The Haunted Mansion.
If you have to see this film but don't want the film's secrets given away early then keep your eyes closed for the first three to five minutes.
Even the plot of the story was bad, a man who fell in love with his fiance' in whom he was to marry dies of a supposedly suicide and years later he tries to bring her back to life and fall in love with him again by locating Eddie Murphys wife who we find that she is not his fiance' reincarnated but then she is and then she isn't again and the whole movie is just one mess.
Jennifer Tilly was the only truly saving grace for this film and then yet again, she couldn't have been expected to carry it any more than she did.
But then suddenly Vishnu starts behaving out of character, his drunken bouts and acts causing the father much shame and embarrassment.
But then I thought that there's been so many "haunted house" movies recently that have bombed (The Haunting, House on Haunted Hill), a lighter, more comedic approach to The Haunted Mansion may be better.
Once there they meet the creepy butler Ramsley and the owner Mr Gracy who are obviously ghosts, and from then on all the supernatural events follow one-another from zombie reflections to levitating around a psychic in a crystal ball called Madame Leota.
However, the story is weaker then expected and its stupid.
If the film was supposed to be scary then it might work on little kids but it's a weak effort.
Its better then The Country Bears but not as good as Pirates of the Caribbean.
If "Johnny Tsunami" is the feel-good film of 1999, then "The Other Me" has got to be the feel-good film of 2000.
If you cannot see the movie then I recommend reading the book and if you have seen the movie then you should read the book also if you've read the book then you should see the movie.
Since then the formulae has been used so many times I have lost count, and few have been any good.
It's chilling to read the next title, "At the Shop the New Foreman Weeds Out the Old Hands," and then to watch while a cold-hearted gent with a bushy black mustache does precisely that: he struts about the carpentry shop, singles out each elderly employee, fires him, and puts a younger man in his place.
Why hire actresses like Anne Meara and Julie Kavner and then use them in two scenes each?
There's some nonsense with an eclipse..an Alzheimer's victim walks in a classroom and stays there..a possible affair..and then its over, thankfully.
Despite the running time, you barely know most of the characters, and then they try to milk some tears from you by some pointless death scenes.
And then she was gone.
If you are a fan of hip hop culture, then you are sure to buy into the whole bravura of the renegade street-artist(I am and I did).
But then, in the second half, things get a little confusing.
And then to top it all off, he turns his back on his friends and says that graffiti is stupid?
Films like these really bother me because they have such potential for greatness, but then take a left turn somewhere instead of staying on the right track.
But then again, it did have a scene in an underground club that was playing Madvillain "Money Folder" so...
If you are not familiar with graf or the culture of writing then watch it and learn.
It you aren't into seeing independent films, gritty urban/graf or hip hop related films then DON'T BOTHER WATCHING OR REVIEWING THIS FILM!
These BBC do more than just tinker with the story, they flatten those worlds into characters, and then strut these characters as stereotypes.
it disappeared for some time then i saw it again a couple of months ago (i'm 19).
Later, he kills his brother for not being supportive about it, then his sister-in-law for becoming suspicious etc etc etcÂ You get the picture: Marcus descents further and further into madness!
A butcher was just having a date with his girlfriend until he cause some problems with a Taxi driver then he kills him and his girlfriend, he is going over the brink of insanity.
"Cannibal Man" by Eloy de la Iglesia is a notorious Spanish shocker about slaughterhouse worker named Marcos.He works in a canning plant attached to the local slaughterhouse.One night,he kills a taxi driver in self defense and then strangles his girlfriend,the only witness to the crime.Desperate with fear,he murders several other people.
As long as you can get over the misleading title & not go into La Semana del Asesino expecting an all out cannibal gore fest like Cannibal Holocaust (1980) or Cannibal Ferox (1981) then you may just be rewarded with an intelligent & satisfying drama/thriller/horror!
Randal is a smart ass who says what's on his mind and then you've got small minded Dante who is mostly quiet and angry inside but to scared to let out his anger.
Maybe the new DVD has more then the Laser Disc had.
The dialogue, given in moments of calm, sucks you in because of its surrealism, its ability to provoke thought, its reflection of your own experience, and then hits you with some of the most laugh out loud, wet your pants, surreal comedy moments that you just don't expect and have ever seen.
If you are the elite of people who finds because of this film you are in the minority, you will then realise how many TRULY stupid people there are in the world.
And if YOU don't get it, well, the kindest I can put it is maybe you NEED to live some more, open your mind and heart a LOT more, then watch it again.
Before then I had never seen this episode and I hadn't realized just how early in the show Scully's abduction had been.
in fact, almost as much was spent on the three minute Soul Asylum video then was spent on Clerks.
Give it a shot, it's something different and if it's your cup of tea then you should love this movie, but if not then come back to it at a later date, you may actually appreciate this film at some point in your life!
If vulgarity is going to be used, then using it sparingly can make it funnier and have more of an impact on the script.
If you have seen American Pie and think of it as being honest and real about sex and the way kids talk, then Clerks is right up your alley.
Jay and Silent Bob are funny as well and Bob provides the film with one of the funnier moments as he dances out of nowhere and then he shocks us with his only line of the film.
Chances are, if you can appreciate the humour of low-brow jokes about pornography as high art, then you'll enjoy "Clerks".
My mom and I first saw this in the mid-1970's and even back then, we joked that the name of the film should be "Joe Nameth Goes to Mexico to Get Laid".
They have Hollis and Duncan dig a deep hole and then toss in knives to see who will survive.
From then she experiences I guess what you could call a mid-life crisis.
A doctor suffers a minor car accident, then, strangely enough, a young lady has a car accident right next to him.
but if your not into a lot of nudity and your bothered with the whole film spoken in Italian with English sub titles then this movie is not for you.
But, before he can get out of his car, there's a crash & there's a woman who has wrecked her car and is hanging out the door, so he puts her into his car, which will then not start.
He sees a nearby house so he goes for help, but encounters a very strange man who then disappears.
And then, he seems to find the woman that he rescued from the accident, surprised to find that she has made it to the house.
In both, then, the luscious Calderoni plays two roles: here, she is a traffic-accident victim and a succubus-like temptress from a previous era; similarly, the male protagonist alternates between a strapping doctor and a decadent, slightly mad aristocrat.
Then our host explains to William that Peter and Evelyn are the repressed, dark sides of Dr. Will and Susan, and then William witnesses a bizarre ritual where Susan and Evelyn merge and make out with Peter while various nude and semi-nude people dance around, apparently (you guessed it) for Satan.
The motorcycle does slow a bit, then tears through the narrow opening and acceleratesÂno chance it was a car of any description.
IMHO, everyone could produce such a flick by recording a normal trip through the village on video, and then adding some exciting sounds generated by a computer racing game.  
Having experienced a similar drive through the streets of Sydney back in the 1960s (in a then just released Mini Cooper S) I know how fast one seems to be traveling when close to road level.
Amy succumbs so easily to the coach's advances that her character should have been made to be six years old instead of thirteen, and even then, a 6 yr old would've run like crazy.
I admit I'll watch one now and then just to see how far the story will wander off into the surreal.
They do take on serious subjects, but always bail out when it comes to quality acting and directing, and then go for the "Men are Evil" conclusion.
The parents here, along with their victimized daughter, all moved more slowly than postal workers on Valium for the first 1 hour and 50 minutes -- then screamed like Banshees on "Speed" for the final 10.
He calls her and calls her and then says that he cannot live without her.
I had crushes on teachers in Jr. High (and then later to a coach but like I said, in college), but thank God none of them took advantage of me like that.
How wonderful, then, that I should run into this quiet little movie, which, although I will admit that Boise, Idaho is not the largest outlet for foreign film, I don't remember ever being released in my area.
How wonderful, then, that I should run into this quiet little movie, which, although I will admit that Boise, Idaho is not the largest outlet for foreign film, I don't remember ever being released in my area.
So ... if you haven't seen this movie yet, then, ... what are you waiting for???
And if you're still not convinced, then you're a very weird person!
Well, anyway, for everyone else, if it's a rainy day, you're bored, you don't know what to do, or you're a bit lonely, then just go out and rent this movie, because I'm pretty sure that you'll love it.
This movie's premise seems to be "take a cast, put them on an SST, and then subject them to trouble after trouble."
If you've got insurance, then you can go private, but otherwise, if you've got enough points, you get put on the waiting list and you eventually get your op for free.
I suppose the directors of this movie wanted to do something a little bit different then the 80s "John and Yoko: A Love Story."
If you are familiar with John Lennon's early life, including the development of his various bands, and the evolution of the Beatles through Germany and the Liverpool scene, then this movie doesn't offer much in the way of history.
You should probably create a game out of it; like doing shots or chugging beers at the beginning, chant along, and then do some more drinking (or whatever your drug of choice is) at the end.
Lith (the very attractive Pamela Prati, a.k.a Pamela Field) then shows up and gives him the idea to conquer.
He then takes over and begins the war effort.
Ela then meets Isa (the other hottie in the movie, Elvire Audray).
The answer is the pretty mysterious case of bodybuilder Sam Pasco, who seem to have appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared (having never acted in a film since) even though he really isn't bad at all in this movie.
Of course it isn't long before he has to put his ideas to the test as a group of criminals hijack a Norwegian supply vessel, plant bombs on two rigs then demand a ransom of twenty five million pounds within twenty four hours.
A female prime minister (an obvious stand-in for then premier Margaret Thatcher) congratulates Bond (er, Roger Moore) at the end.
But then, so is ffolkes.
But Roger Moore - then still the reigning James Bond - as a women bashing, cold-blooded and bearded anti-terrorist expert does not just save the day but runs away with every scene he is in and eventually with the movie itself.
i did not read the novel, but if this is a faithful adaption, then i can only assume the book is as convoluted as the subsequent movie.
I obtained the original on disc and then did work on it to make it look and sound better digitally.
You see a kid whose gone through a lot of emotional drama that shows hes real held back from his mom and then totally trying to make the best of what can only be described as a hellish situation ( house arrest ) He scouts his neighborhood and finds a psycho path next door, pure gold.
see this movie for yourself, and if you give it less then 8 stars...well your a idiot!
It started off great, building the audiences care for Kale and his father, and then abruptly killing his father.
If the critics are to be believed that this is a ripoff/remake, then every romantic comedy coming down the pipeline is one as well.
And then...i realized this was a teen movie disguised as thriller.
A seemingly insignificant action occurs and then a man's entire existence changes!
However, out of the blue, the man disappears to Hong Kong and from then on the plot really makes no sense at all.
Not to say the film is perfect, as it definitely isn't, but it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do and then some.
This isn't a horror flick, but I'd say it gave e more of a fright then a lot of horror movies.
And then Shannon Doherty as Rene, first of all she really didn't seem thrilled to be in this movie, she never hung around the set, she would take off when she was done working.
I taken with the movie from then on.
If not for the preoccupation with superhero sex organs, supermans potential birth control or possible future realistic child bearing partners, then just simply for the answer to what noises do you make when you're having whoopee.
**spolier warning**  this movie has know story line - but is set in a mall the film is mainly about 2 guys who loose there girlfriends but then try to get back up with them even if it means going on a game show - this film will leave laughting again and again.
However, if this situation is impossible for you, then you will not only not see the humor herein, you will most likely bemoan the time wasted in its viewing.
It challenges the audience to think but then there is no payoff for the effort.
Marc is at first perplexed, then he confronts his wife and fellow workers with the fact that he just shaved off his mustache and no one believes that he ever had one!
this is an incredible movie and if your a clerks fan (which I'm assuming is the only Kevin smith film you've seen because its blasphemous to watch them out of order) then this is even better.
its laugh out loud funny and anyone remotely interested in the inner workings of a geek or, like me, you are a geek, then this will give voice to the geek generation and make it cool.
When asked how he feels about the fact that he no longer has a relationship with Bill Mumy, he tears up some papers the filmmakers are working from then walks off.
He begins to get increasingly disturbed that no one would notice something as elemental as facial hair... and then things suddenly spiral out of control.
Lake Mungo feels like someone watched Twin Peaks a few too many times then stumbled across The Last Broadcast and decided they want a J Horror moment as the cliff hanger moment.
All I can say about this movie is WTF the concept is the same as your Blair Witch,Paranormal Activity and so on but somewhere between the halfway point of the movie its almost as the director lost all his sense of thinking and drops a twist which makes you go huh,and then about another 45 minutes or so later when you see the ending credits that is when you will have the reaction WHAT THE F***.
I read another user reviews about this movie and was looking forward to a good scare unfortunately this one does not deliver anything of such sort.I would definitely say pass on this one,i will give it 2 starts simply for the fact that it was shot well other then that hopefully the 2011 remake delivers more then this.
The family then experiences a series of strange and inexplicable events centered in and around their home.
The movie then jumps to what seems like days later (or perhaps even longer) and the main character now has a moustache grown out.
And then the genuinely scary stuff starts.
ANYWAY on to the movie: This takes place supposedly in the 50's or early 60's, and it seems to waver between when it wants to be as it talks about seeing Invasion of the Body Snatchers and then mentions a roomful of people as looking like the casting room for 'Psycho'.
Brings in his office environment, confusion do people really know him there?, then the clown jacket where he imagines his wife picked it up for him, running off home to get the next flight hong kong to free himself from all the dilemma in his life >> well thats his vacation, thats how he imagined his vacation to have kicked off, freedom from his confused and stressed life.
Reality starts when he's sitting in the boat with the red shirt, bearded and eating noodles...  Post card incident is a trick a big trick, its shown him sitting in a hotel window writing to his wife, well if this takes place in his dreams then in reality while he is with his wife later after saying goodbye to their recent friends how could he have the card???
he then flicks it to the water.... thats confusing!!!
well I agree with most other reviews the key is the hongkongs night lights reflecting from the water, its shown at the beginning then in the middle while he is dreaming and at the end....thus confirming its all his dream...
The script by Robert Sabaroff was based on the novel 'The Seventh' by Donald E. Westlake can be divided into three chunks, the first third of the film revolves around the recruiting of the team with some fun set-pieces to make sure each member is up to the task, the second third of the film is my favourite when they carry out the heist & there's that feeling that you root for them & you want to get away with it & all the close calls they have & watching the plan unfold is pretty fun, then the final third of the film is perhaps the weakest as several random events come together & tear the thieves apart & it becomes a rather dull runaround after the money which goes missing through no fault of their own but does obviously cause problems as they don't know who to trust.
And even then, Handsome is too innocent.
But it's frustrating to see that the camera is moved quite well in some sequences, and then the setting comes across as so unreal.
As a film maker, if you're going to make a film that doesn't tie things together neatly, then you need to realize you have an obligation to make your film about SOMETHING more meaningful than the incongruous events you are showing on the screen.
It's apparently what happens when you take a neat starting idea (a man shaves off his mustache, and everyone seems not to notice, then they claim he never had one), and then you become more interested in making yourself look clever than in actually telling a story that bears some relevance on our lives.
Fascinatingly mannered early talkie adaptation of a semi-classic Somerset Maugham story, Rain starts wonderfully, with a rainstorm, then declines into a lurid drama of the sort that was considered shocking at the time (1932), and scarcely raises an eyebrow today.
The two "ladies," Mrs. Robert MacPhail and Mrs. Walter Davidson, are decked out from their shoes to their hats which were so stylish and sophisticated, and then comes Sadie.
Tim "Handsome" O'Hara, William Gargan, for Sidney Australia and then changing her mind when she's confronted by Davidson.
Huston was fine as the sanctimonious but sincere preacher trying to convert the "loose woman" Sadie Thompson - but in the end loses the battle, something I wish was shown, but then it wasn't in the play or book so I shouldn't expect it.
I want to avoid spoilers, so I'll just say that events then take place that make Sadie realize she is just fine as she is, and that the missionary was a hypocrite of a human being.
Claustrophobic,alternately gloomy then harshly - lit,"Our mother's house" is a film about children for adults.
One of the best psychological horror films ever made, if you liked "The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane" (1976) you will love "Our Mother's House", which takes a similar premise, then adds some ambitious "Lord of the Flies" elements and throws in the production design of "Girly".
A weird one parent family then the mother dies.
If you're looking for a horror flick, look elsewhere, but if you're looking for a subtle, well acted melodrama, then look no further!
From then on, it's anybody's guess!
So, if you want to enjoy the mystery first, then stop right now...and come back after you've seen the film.
When he gets there, he wanders around a bit, alternately ferrying from Hong Kong to Kowloon and back a few times Â a great metaphor for his indecision - then pays his way onto a coastal trader to finally wind up at an un-named coastal village.
Dr. Ek (very weird guy and mediocre acting skills) explains to him what he did and then sends him to this house called the House of Love.
I think that is what harmed this film the most Â but then I gave up on my plight to avoid cheap horror films and decided to watch the equally low-budget horror/suspense/thriller film "The Attic Expeditions", and I must admit, I was rejuvenated.
I even enjoyed the Kyle MacLachlan-esquire style of Andras Jones Â then there was Ted Raimi, whom didn't almost fit within this film, but still made it fun to see him sweat.
Things go along smoothly enough as the man starts to come unwound due to this, but then what?
You will then be told how clever it is and that you didn't get it.
The book comes with the house, the house forcing Trevor to write the book, then forming the basis of nearly all the vision and forcing him to write constantly to populate it.
He has a singular importance in the history of literature, both in terms of placing a discoverer of story in the story, and in terms of being a representative of the (then) new notion that people are motivated and act rationally.
Holmes is transported from Victorian times to then modern times.
Architect Marc (Vincent Lindon) has had a moustache since he was knee high to a blueprint and it is, he feels, part of him, then he takes it into his head to speculate on just how much he is identified via the moustache.
a common mistake, back in the day, vatos didn'thave gang signs it must take a low budget chicano movie made in the time to be more authentic then hollywood can buy
But if you have ever lived, experienced or known someone who was ever lost in the world of street life then you have to see this movie.
Until then, my taped TV version will have to do.
If you like violence, sex then you won't like this.
If watching Threes Company reruns aren't enough to get your Don Knotts dose, then this movie is for you.
Indeed, 'La Moustache' is one of these attention-grabbing cinematic mysteries that first baffle the spectators, and then leave them behind with a bunch of questions unanswered.
Yeah, that would be good, because then I could see every one of these dildoes fry and watch them float down to earth in a shower of bacon bits.
If people of the future don't need money, yet ferengi still value the non-replicatable gold-encased liquid latinum(the gold is a worthless container for up to a few drops of latinum) for it's rarity, then how does the cast ever afford to go to Quark's, or the holo-suites, or anywhere on the promenade, including tailoring by Garak?
Quark, the uncle of one of the thieves tries to get his nephew released and Sisko says he will release him on one condition: he reopens his bar rather then leaving the station.
Deep Space Nine's first couple of years weren't THAT great, but then the show started to rise with a great storyline and great situations, such as the Klingons' separation from the Federation, Sisko's destiny and the Federation's war against the Dominion and Cardassian alliance.
Damnation Alley was first a short story and then expanded to a Novella (probably to make the movie from).
I was so excited when I saw that this movie was being made because I had enjoyed the short story so much and then to see how Hollywood butchered it.
And then when they needed to repair these state of the art "RV's", they happen to be on top of "what's left of Detroit" and find a replacement rear end in a junkyard.
I can't say it any plainer then that.
If you like, sci-fi flicks that entertaining then watch this movie and make up your mind.
One shot will be all blue-ish, the next, coated in ugly green hues, the next two will be fine, but different contrasts of light and dark, then the next one will be a hue of green with really queer "lightning" in the sky.
We then jump right into the world after the war, which apparently show us that the only people surviving nuclear winter will be "B" actors-go figure.
As for me, this movie has a true treat, an fantastic heart-warming family movie like we all need every now and then.
If you want to see a quality, lighthearted, funny and fantastic 40s-era movie, then check this one out next time it's on TCM.
I was in first grade when I saw it for my birthday and I remember liking it then.
This is because if you are looking for fun movie that really does pull at the kid inside you, then this is definitely it.
Hook is in disbelief that Banning is Peter Pan, but Tinkerbell promises she'll have been back into shape in a week, then their war shall continue.
So if you haven't seen it then go watch it!
But if you like a good, cheesy romance story, then you should like this picture.
After all, what's wrong with a little dumb fun now and then?
The main thing about this film is that it is really good, but it IS designed for children, and adults who go back and watch it years later, then suddenly spot loads of mistakes are just ruining it for themselves and others.
He discovers there may be more to the story of this masked phantom then he realizes.
If you're a superhero fan (espically a batman fan) then try and find it on DVD and give it a watch.
We as the audience want to feel a connection to him and I feel I understood more of what was going on in this character then any of the live action versions.
I've never been a big fan of the old movies, but I saw "Chicago" with Gere, Zellweger, and Zeta-Jones and then saw the film "Roxie Hart" (1927) with Ginger Rogers, and kind of liked the campy comedy that this film portrayed, so I keep an eye out for her on TCM and whenever I stumble across one of her films, I try and watch them.
Andrea after suffering the killing of her father could not think in other thing but justice just like Bruce after she leaved him, then for an unknown circumstance, but the other difference is that Batman doesn't kill, the Phantasm does.
And then there's also Andrea's father, who... OK, not much to try and spoil here, lets just say at some point the Joker gets involved, and everything jets into a 'laughing matter'.
Only here there's a catch: the running time is short (originally the filmmakers thought it would be meant for TV before WB changed their minds), so there's only so much time to dig into the dilemma Wayne is caught in in the movie, where his identity is being cross-checked all over as the killer of the gangsters, and then the personal connection with Andrea and her father.
then another flashback shows Bruce starting to want to fight crime but not knowing how to go about it right.
then, a chilling upbeat song begins as the camera then scrolls down into the bat cave.
It has a great story that flashes back to just before Bruce took up the mantle of the bat and the woman he was involved with at the time, then skips forward to an unknown assassin killing Gotham City's mobsters, and we see how the 2 story's meet.
If you're a liberal looking for some anti-American propaganda then be sure to rent this movie.
All the reviewers who claim it makes you think and has a message are correct but it only makes you think for about two seconds - then you realize the attempts of moral equivalence between us and the terrorists are totally unconvincing.
He's born in Sudan, watches his father murdered in a car bombing, is raised in Chicago by a full-on Muslim mother, then joins the US Army, then leaves the army and joins the Mujahadeen (terrorist group), then is an moderate Muslim working undercover helping the US government fight terrorism?
After the movie was over I couldn't believe the actors actually agreed to cooperate with this, but then I figured the Pentagon must be sending really big cheques to buy their souls.
If you happen to be studying Propaganda Techniques used in Hollywood Movies, then this one is one to watch for you.
Unfortunately I do not foresee any Box Office records being broken, or Oscars being won, but if you are in the mood for a good ride then I would recommend "Traitor"
I usually go to Malco's reviewers and then Rotten Tomatoes, to see what the consensus on a movie is.
Traitor did a very good job of stepping on the audience's toes with some lines that could've been considered prejudiced, and then catching themselves with actual truths about the war in the Middle East, in addition to religions themselves.
Bottom-line: If you are looking for a story that is more than skin deep (which the Coen brother are notorious for) then you have come to the right place.
This disc, due to the negligence of a law clerk, then falls into the hands of two fitness trainers (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt), one of whom is also sleeping with the adulterous federal agent.
But then again his character is a dribbling idiotic health nut with some mildly homosexual personality traits, so maybe Brad wasn't even acting, maybe he was just being himself (Ha Ha Ha).
What makes Burn after reading less of a film then most Coen Brother's work is that there is not any real thought involved.
Let me turn this around then and begin with what I liked: Alan Rickman's performance, especially in his strange little talks with Dennis Farina in the former's wine shop.
A lot of the boring crap could have been cut out and you would have had the same result but then the movie would have been a half hour long.
Linda calls him her friend and then all but ignores him.
Consequently each shines in their given roles, relishing the word play and eking the maximum out of each situation.No scene is dwelled upon, and the occasional bloody outburst of violence, or titillating appearance of a Sybian machine , is shown then moved on from before you have time to work out exactly what is going on.
His every appearance in the film as forced to quit his job, very angry CIA Analyst who then decided to write a memoir, was a blast.
But then the master craftsmen in charge of this masterpiece added the final ingredient -- namely the entire catalog of Hollywood romantic-adventure-drama-comedy clichÃ©'s.
or 'Dumb and Dumber', if you didn't like those then you won't like this.
On the other hand, if you have an open mind and like 'stupid comedy' films then you are in for a treat.
This movie does try to be something more towards the end but then which comedy doesn't.
<sighs> Oh, well... then they went on to imply that the Internet was actually controllable... and could be shut off by someone attacking hardlines, satellites, or fiber optic lines... as if the users could actually tell what medium was being used for the transmission of their signals.
The only hint or clue we're ever given is one passenger who appears to be normal who claims "nothing went wrong on the flight, I slept, then felt a bump..and I had that awful nightmare.." .
It should also be noted that leading man Mark Lindsay Chapman, then going under the name Mark Lindsay, was given this role as compensation after being cast as John Lennon in a TV biopic, only to be removed when his real name was discovered to be the same as Lennon's killer.
He then decides that having a multi-billion dollar computer house would be perfect so he won't have to do so much work.
then it shows where the smoothie ingredients are kept and there's hundreds of oranges in the kitchen island!!!!
Ryan Merriman plays the whiz-kid genius who wanted to win the house, then decides, "Hey, Dad, maybe we shouldn't have moved in here"...after having complained about wanting to throughout the entire beginning of the film.
It's a lot of laughs and then gets a bit frightening when Sagal materializes as a holograph and shuts the place down.
Then 3 of the guards get turned into chickens, then another three gets turned into pigs, ans then the last three guys turned into rabbits.
So then it's two against two.
So then the prince rushes pulling out his sword with makes the magic bounce back making Stepmother and drizella being turned into toads.
But now I see I was wrong, there's actually some good ones in plot wise and then there's some bad ones you just have to watch them for at least 30 mins to give them a chance but some may require 40 mins the most.
lol that's why we all need to read the title of a book and then flip it over and read the back of it before buying, or sometimes we open the book and read a page or we just decide to give it a shot and give the first chapter a read then when were done we are hooked or not.
The opening sequence where Stepmother gets her hands on the wand happen all in the confines of a song about how in love the prince and Cinderella are, and then we're OFF!
I remember sitting in the theatre when the movie was re released in New Zealand cinemas at the age of ten and falling in love with the story then.
But when they are not cheap and rushed but well told and polished like Cinderella 3, then it is a true joy to see the continuation of these beloved characters lives when they have been a part of so many wonderfully fond childhood memories.
Thus the first segment of II, starting right after Cinderella's honeymoon, has already happened in the beginning of Twist, but time is then rewound; the third segment with Anastasia and the Baker happens entirely after Twist; and the second segment, which was the stupid little story about the mice, is completely irrelevant.
I loved the twist at the almost end made it more dark.I also love the fact that Cinderella Got the princes love more harder then before not just cause of her looks and everything but cause of more she had to fight for love it was more realistic then a girl going to the ball and thats it.They showed more of the prince too we didn't really know him before and he talked a lot more which made it better.The 2nd movie was horrible made no sense and was not interesting to watch and way off story line.
But if your as much of a kid as i am then you will definitely get a kick out of this movie.Buy and watch over and over, trust me you won't be the only one.
If you want a hacker movie War Games (Mathew Broderick) or Sneakers (Robert Redford, River Phoenix) are better movies in the same sort of area or for a more MTV friendly teen hacker movie then go for Hackers (Angelina Jolie & Tommy Lee Miller).
but then, it all fits if you watch mike nichols' career going \ from virginia woolf to primary colors you can find silkwood exactly in the middle.
She was then killed in a car accident.
It's enough to say it's the Karen Silkwood story, and then let the film speak for itself, because it speaks volumes.
If "Silkwood" is such a great movie, then a large part of its greatness is definitely owed to Meryl Streep: She plays Karen Silkwood, a single mother who is working in a nuclear plant based somewhere in Oklahoma.
A common question to this movie is: If Karen Silkwood and her colleagues are so worried about being contaminated by plutonium at a processing plant then why do they smoke so many cigarettes if they're worried about their health ?
If we call this his comeback, then it was sure a good comeback.
She is then patronized by a doctor who straight-facedly assures her that she has only superficial exposure and will be just fine.
Metroid has always been fun because at the start you are real weak and then by the end of the game, you feel like you could take on any kind of bounty hunter prey in the universe.
Romans didn't just stand there waiting to be attacked (the final battle) they would have thrown their pila (javelins) and then drawn swords and hacked into the enemy.
If you see this film on TV and like ancient history and legends it's worth a watch, but whatever you do don't pay to see this in a movie theatre because this is a long way off being anything other then a TV movie.
I think I heard a didgeridoo once as well, but by then nothing could shock or surprise me anymore.
(Some Spoilers) Somewhat better then you would have expected Mike Hammer flick with Robert Bray in the leading role as the tough as nails private eye who gets involved in a slew of murders as well as a hunt for the missing one million dollars Venacci Jewel collection.
<sighs> Oh, well... then they went on to imply that the Internet was actually controllable... and could be shut off by someone attacking hardlines, satellites, or fiber optic lines... as if the users could actually tell what medium was being used for the transmission of their signals.
If only the Academy could recognize such beautiful work, then they'd not be condemned.
Rent it, rent it again, rent it again, and then buy it.
Why can't the organisation employ computer wizards to track down rogue computer operators and then send a crack team of commandos to round up the bad guys ?
There is the pregnant woman at the beginning of the film having her fortune read one afternoon in the 1600's, there is the modern day SamJackson doing his violin consulting work over the span of a week, and then there are all times in all the years between.
But instead of staying with the auction all the time, we flash back to the creation of the violin in 17th century Italy and then follow it as it makes its way through an 18th century Austrian monastery/orphanage, a violinist in 19th century Oxford and China during Mao's Cultural Revolution... Each time it brings the person who owns it a lot of fame, but also bad luck and despair, often resulting in the death of the owner or someone the owner really loves...  What I appreciated in this movie is that it wasn't just an ordinary drama or thriller.
When you learn how the violin acquired its captivating shade of red you will most likely be stunned at first, but then touched by the thought behind it and the bittersweetness of the moment.
If not liking it because of it's closing immorality is not missing the point and the essence and the true exsistence of this film, then I don't know what is.
Wouldn't you think that if you were part of a movie and people were specifically asking for that movie to re-released then something could be done.There were other movies of equal Australian bloke etiquette value like The Odd Angry Shot and The Last of The Knucklemen and it's a shame that one of the mighty lot is missing.
He then goes and gets a side-kick, love interest, all the stuff for his movie.
Until then, if you have the chance to see this at a film festival, be sure to.
Grateful Dead always jammed till whenever people were sick of it, then went on for another hour.
Wavy Gravy works for a while, then becomes tedious as hell and most of the concert-goers aren't terribly interesting.
Not every artist or legendary event is shown in this documentary,artists like Joni Mitchell and the Band are not included which I personaly would have enjoyed.And the forgotten "Abbie Hoffman incident" is also not included.I have this incident on CD,the Who box set,but I would have liked it when I had on DVD also.But then,You can't have everything!Also some songs and artists are kind of misplaced.Best example for me is the performance of Sha-Na-Na doing "At the Hop".This Rock 'n Roll song doesn't quite belong on this festival,but still it is a funny sort of intermezzo.
However if you are the kind of person who can see the diamond here hiding underneath the rough, and wish to see one of the most beautiful Chinese silent films ever made, then don't miss The Peach Girl.
Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace And Music to me, is more then just an ordinary run of the mill music documentary, it was a record of the hippie culture of 1969, the youth of America trying to make a difference, a spectacular experience of one of America's greatest rock festivals before the days of the original MTV (Music Television) & VH1 before they became sleezy reality TV networks.
For a brief hour or so I abandoned my car on the side of the road to make the trek to a then unknown location, but it seemed odd to me that as many people were coming from the direction of Yasgur's Farm as going toward it.
It was a bit surreal back then, and even now to realize that a city of almost half a million people came together for a weekend, enjoyed three days of peace and music, and then disbanded quietly while a nation watched in wonder.
The landowner who can't believe the amount of people who have come to his farm  The locals cheerfully giving food and water to the kids and commenting about how respectful they are  The kids going to a music festival but for some reason expecting and getting so much more - and then queuing to phone home and tell the parents they're okay!
If you're a period person, grew up in the late 60's, or appreciate classic rock music, then I urge you to go and watch this classic piece of work.
As I have seen this many times since it first came out on in the theater and then on VHS, I now just fast-forward chapters on the DVD to the music, enjoying my favorite performances in this epic documentary of the most famous rock concert of all time.
For someone who was part of that time, things that were "cool" back then now look and sound a little stupid and naive, but it's still fun to watch.
It is unique to witness how this actress can be captured so unattractive then in the right light become the most radiant unusual striking figure of defined beauty.
First sheÂ´s a midwestern farmgirl, then she goes to the BIG CITY and works as a waitress until -VOILA!- sheÂ´s discovered as a model!
However, for some of us, the challenge is to discover the good points of 'critical failures', such as "Exposed", and as everyone seems to be somewhat more then vaguely aware, what's most redeeming about this film is, in a word, "NASTASSJAKINSKI"!
I myself am a eclectic martial art stylist who blends Wing Chung Kung Fu, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, Professional Wrestling, and Krav Maga into a single loosely structured flexible system I call "Combat Wrestling", and of course, I like a good martial art film now and then.
But then, many people wouldn't watch a "Karate" movie if they were paid to see it.
But then, our own government does this and sets a good example for thugs to emulate.
This then is the famous Oath of Peace made famous not by Boddhidharma, but Steven R. Donaldson the fantasy writer.
If they can't even keep a straight face or tone of voice while making this, then why should I when I watch it, even though it's not meant to be comedy.
Maybe in the end my expectations were too high, but then again, how low do I have to set my standards to be able to enjoy a movie?
I found myself shifting around in my seat, spacing in and out every now and then and pretty much wanting to leave.
The story then struggles between these two digressing strands and the whole plot is stretched too thin to cover them.
There is a happy ending as you would expect; but by then, so many wheels have come off that you no longer take the joke seriously any more.
If you think this is good, then try 'Bedazzled'.
Parents fork out a lot of money to put their kids through dance class, then more money on costumes, buying the DVD, buying the music etc...all for 3 minutes on stage.
You wait and wait for something to finally happen, something that will make half-way any sense, something that will connect the rather flimsy-looking dots into something at least resembling logic but then...
(Perhaps the director and the scriptwriter joined them in the beating...) Did the cop and his wife both beat on the girl, and then each other - and then themselves?
The best part of season two for me is the episode where they go to the spa (without alcohol en cellphones....) when they go back as fast as they can... hahaha....and then they get car trouble.
They find it...so what then?
This show deserves way more credit then it gets.
It's in a good time slot too - watch Project Runway then switch to NBC for this quality programming.
In fact, one thing that is unfailingly depicted throughout the whole, excellent series of Foyles War is the calm control and sangfroid of the main characters that was typical back then, even if it seems to have disappeared somewhat these days.
); the 'outdoor' climax, then, is given an added touch of strangeness by taking place in the midst of a procession headed by a group of caped villagers!
The mean-spirited mother who refuses to pay any attention to her daughter's story of the escaped panther, and dismisses it as a lie to get out of going to the store, and then cruelly locks her out of the house, must be the most obnoxious mother outside of Cinderella.
There's no reason to feature these scenes at all, as watching a family member wandering around picking up a gift and then celebrating with each other is a giant useless series of scenes.
Soon, one girl dies, then another, and another...and evidence points that a cat did it and later to something completely different.
Tumbleweeds stirred up by the dry winds and trains hurtling over trellises are unnerving enough, but then something else starts its pursuit.
With deep and disturbing psychological overtones that strikes more fear in the hearts of those in the movie and audience then the big cat itself.
A moment later there's a terrifying scream and then all is eerily quiet.
Tourneur direction shows how the mind can be easily tricked and manipulated by an imaginative film maker with nothing more then lights sound & shadows.
And thus brings far more shocks and jolts to his audience back in 1943 then what the best state-of-the-art special effects can do in a movie today.
But then again, would you expect anything less from a Val Lewton production?
I specially liked the episode of her return to Singapore, which depicts so well the gap that has been experienced by this proud, ingenuous nature, hypnotised by the freedom of America - as far as to forget all moral barriers and follow her single pleasure till the extreme - and then crash down on reality when going back to her family roots - probably in search of a recomfort she was starting to miss in the vain and stupid environment of those cynical sex filmmakers.
Probably everyone who has progressed from cell division as the reproductive means of choice has some interest in porn, but if yours runs a little deeper then the "Annabel Chong Story" is a very worthwhile documentary to watch, offering a truthful glimpse behind the scenes.
To dispel a few popular notions about this documentary, it's not exploitative other than of Grace Quek's (that's Annabel Chong's real name) exhibitionism save possibly her parents, it doesn't purport to chronicle all minutiae of human sexuality, pornography is probably not the most wholesome business to be and in and this fact can not reasonably be blamed on the documentary (don't kill the messenger), film maker Gough Lewis repudiates the fact that he and Quek were a couple at the beginning of this movie for the patent reason that he wanted to make a movie about Quek and not about their relationship, Quek is neither centerfoldish-statuesque nor is she phenomenally ugly with the "the most crooked teeth ever", if you think her views are bizarre then you have obviously enjoyed the privilege of blissful ignorance of the field of womens' / gender studies and, unsurprisingly, Grace might not be the wholesome waif that you can exchange coy glances over glasses of iced tea at the country fair with.
Grace wanted her mom to be proud of her but then went back to making dirty movies.
Watching the film is like being on amphetamines - the first half is hyper-frenetic and luridly self-congratulatory, but then the "come-down" happens.
"Prison on Fire" stars the then raising star Chow Yun-Fat as Ching, a positive and friendly inmate in a prison in which Lo Ka Yiu, played by Tony Leung Ka Fai is sentenced.
This goes on for a bit then the city is thrown into chaos as the victims of the rats start dining on everyone not infected.
Or maybe the disease is spread via the Olsen twins and everyone becomes anorexic cocaine addicts that still eat human flesh but then promptly vomit it back up so their re-animated asses don't get fat.
The film drags a bit and then picks up steam in the final half hour.
Still it sets everyone up so nicely that when then infected begin to assault the people we've come to know we are more than horrified, we are saddened by their fates.
If you enjoyed "28 Days Later" or are a horror fan in general then you should certainly check out "Mulberry Street".
If that freaks you out, then you won't like the movie much.
If you don't think it will scare you from what you may have read about it until now, then see it on my words.
First small incidents here and there take place, then those who have been bitten begin to degenerate into a rat-like form (It's a little mix of 28 Days Later, Dawn of the Dead, and... well, Rat Creatures.)
If you can stand the idea of people turning into murderous rat-beings, then you would probably like this flick.
But by then, personally, I was already too impressed to allow the minor & understandable flaws to spoil my viewing experience.
The movie clearly shows this and then completely ignores its own findings to declare global warming the boogey man (Though in this particular case it was obviously innocent.
If this was a first time director then I would expect this type of result....but it isn't.
this movie is pretty compelling and it gets pretty dark, my god the only grudge i hold against it is that it's too short, there should have been 3 segments but then again what the hell am i talking about this movie is so pure evil, but in a good way.
It's divided into two parts - Fiction, with its heavy sexual, presumably-racist and ironic elements, a searing affair that many people seem to have found offensive without getting the underlying satire, and then there's Non-Fiction; amazing how much spot-on societal jabs T. S. squeezes into this one, and plus it has another great, multi-layered performance from Paul Giamatti, always a major selling point of any film, for me.
*SOMEWHAT SPOILER* The beginning shot of the director makes you sympathize him which then leads you to trust his intentions.
In fact it verges on being a very good one, but the ending kicks the audience in the teeth and then makes it just a slightly above average one.
Instead of criticizing how the movie doesn't follow the book as much as you believe it should, you should just enjoy the film for what it is and then you can re-read with new visuals to think of!
It would seem, then, that the film was simply just undermarketed.
So she jumps in, swims around for about 30 seconds then gets out and just sits there, She heres something in the bush, so she turns of the tape to look around, next thing you know a gun is being pointed straight at her head.. and BANG, her head falls into the pool, and the start credits come up, Not to bad for a beginning, But after the credit the storyline is about a bunch of filmmakers that set out to an island to make a light hearted comedy, But the actors that the producer's have set up aren't really what you would call Great,,, or even Good.
This box was then handed off from mayor to mayor for nearly 200 years.
When they finally leave the city via escape slide they go down down down...then they walk up up up stairs to escape to the surface... when they are at the surface they can see the city far below through a karst window (cave)yet when the generator stops they see no light in the city...I didn't really need ten lines of text to say this movie was a lame waste of time and money.
When no one would listen to them, especially the city mayor - Mayor Cole (the effective yet underused Bill Murray) - it then becomes up to Lina and Doon to find the exit that leads to the surface, which is infinitely easier in theory than in practice, considering the plethora of puzzles and riddles they would have to solve.
The cutting edge of early '90's American film includes this work by Gregg Araki, a frightfully funny, harrowing tale of two HIV positive dudes who can't stand it all, blame (then president) George Bush, and take it all on the road for a final (?)
It's interesting to see Babe Ruth as he looked back then, but the film isn't very good, and the better performances are by some of Ruth's supporting cast.
This film which purports to chronicle the childhood of the Babe is almost entirely a fabrication....he didn't grow up in some small town....he grew up near the waterfront docks of Baltimore,MD for the first few years of his life where his father owned and ran a saloon that catered to a very rough crowd.Young George was largely unsupervised most of the time and was continually getting into one scrape or another...as a result George Sr had him enrolled in the St. Mary's Industrial School for boys and pretty much stayed out of young George's life from then on...I'm sure this film's version made for better publicity for the up and coming Babe as well as for the Yankees...Colonel Ruppert was very mindful of his team's public image and making a film about the real version of Babe's young life at that time would have had a lot of negative consequences
Here's every kill in the film so you don't have to see it: gal at the pool gets blasted in the head with a shotgun at close range, which decapitates her and causes her cranium to sink to the bottom of the pool; guy boils to death in the pool and then later on the cook makes boiled lobster for dinner, which causes everyone to leave the dinner table in disgust (I take issue with this because it's lobster...who the hell turns down lobster for crissakes?!
The highlight is seeing Ruth at bat in a real game -- the pitcher winds and throws and the Babe swings and hits the ball, and then runs the bases.
In one of many Looney Tunes cartoons involving classical music, Bugs Bunny is in concert playing Franz Liszt's "Second Hungarian Rhapsody" (despite claiming to have never heard of Liszt) but gets interrupted by audience members and then by a mouse.
First Bugs has some problems with a coughing guy in the audience, he knows how to solve that, then with a mouse who plays parts of the rhapsody.
She loses interest in Tommy and then she meets Keith.
Given that this is an early eighties film, you've got to expect some tacky visuals and an even tackier soundtrack; but the film takes these elements and then delivers a story that is far too serious in tone, and it doesn't bode well at all.
This film is not like any others, so if you haven't yet seen it, then run along down to Blockbuster!!!
And then there's the daughter played by Linda Cardellini.
I can't imagine why anyone would want to sit through this movie, but if you're a fan of Lifetime Movies, in-your-face earnestness and movies where the upper middle class hero finds love and redemption, then, hey, maybe this is the movie for you.
And many overrated movies have that formula, which only works because you become so numb as you watch it, that you feel very surprised by the final outcome of the plot, and then believe that it was such a terrific film.
The ending of the movie "The Unsaid" is a bit confusing at first with Tommy going wild in his effort to get out of the Holly Health School and almost murdering his psychologist Dr. Wagner and then taking Shelly hostage in the process.
There's bad movies, there's good movies, and then there's plain old boring movies, like this one.
The story is about a high-tech firm that measures models and then gives the plastic surgeon the right specs to make the model "perfect", a 'LOOKER'.
it then goes back 4 years & we find out one of the ladies was a student involved with some revolutionaries.
The group plans on using sex as bait to attract,then strike when he is not expecting it.
Word is that Ang Lee had to cut a half hour for China (which has far more astringent censorship laws then Hong Kong).
I can't think of a more prevalent example of misguided trailers then Ang Lee's new piece Lust, Caution.
A continuous shot of taking a piece of mahjong, then the hand of tiles, then throwing the unwanted one away.
They had no idea back then how far it would eventually go.
She then describes to them how she must endure and pretend to love Leung wholeheartedly as a part of her role, and how she endures the prolonged sessions of sex only to hope for them to crash in the door and shoot Leung in the back of the head to have his brains and blood splattered all over her body.
Bad acting, a jump from an American start where two guys steal some videos from a video shop and then hide away in a female friends flat to watch them.
The Beast, menacing and then tender, has the two most touching moments in the film with his (SPOILER) sacrifice of possession of Belle and his merciful sparing of Gaston in the final battle, but his transformation into that unselfish being should have been more developed-here we come to the movie's flaws.
I don't care if he is an animated character: Gaston is a very, very, VERY sexy tenor, and if no one else is attracted, then you can go to hell!
And then getting in too deep.
The old woman then changed herself into a fairy, tells Prince that he had no love in his heart, and turns him into the monster of the same name.
She then makes a deal: Belle agrees to stay in the dark castle with the horrible beast in return to her father's freedom.
The movie takes one whole hour to set its plot (that is Â a whole hour for the drug dealers to loose their drug and our "heroes" to get a hold of it), and only then, the actual story begins.
Even though it was obvious that the relations between The Beatles themselves were then too strained, they still blasted the gray Liverpool sky with that album.
Even then, there is masses of stuff (even from Ringo) that's still way up there, especially from the 1970s.
Look at a film from 1969, then look at one from 1974 - flowery, chintzy, all greasy and horrible.
They don't explain anything, if I hadn't watched the Anthology Doc I wouldn't even have a clue why the hell they're in this big film studio, plus, I don't think John Lennon says more then three words in the whole film (Paul never seem to shut up though).
It's more footage of them singing and playing the songs then anything else.
If you really must go ahead and watch this film but be warned if you're looking for anything other then a series of them playing various songs, forget about this one.
I didn't see it then; it was several years later, when it was a staple at 'midnight movie' showings (as was 'Magical Mystery Tour').
Apart from the quantum leaps in sound technology since then nothing of any lasting musical value has been added Â there has been no progression.
John, Paul, George and Ringo got together first in Twickenham Studios then in the Apple basement in January 1969 to rehearse some new songs with the assistance of almost-5th Beatle Billy Preston (and occasionally actual-5th Beatle George Martin) and with the hope of playing live again sometime soon.
There's a lot of classic pop music in here Â from their own then new stuff to rock'n'roll standards from the '50's, which the Beatles were in an ideal and unchallengeable position to translate for listeners both of the Old World of pop and the New World of rock that they left behind them.
And for-by much is made of Paul and George's spat (with John acting as unlikely peace-maker) and the at times tired and dishevelled appearance of the guys themselves, there are many other revealing and rewarding vignettes, even before director Michael Lindsay-Hogg, corrals the band for three assured in-studio video performances (all, significantly, of Macca tracks) and then the great idea (since aped by the Stones and U2) of playing their new stuff live on Apple's roof, on a biting cold Jamuary day.
You reach a fine pitch of performance at the end of the year, then break for summer.
Puck believed that was Anarchy, then Johnny Black shows up and basically takes that whole concept and says it will never work.
Every now and then a movie just plain WORKS.
Third: After defying my expectations, it then turned out to be something better than I imagined it could / would be.
And then I realized: IT'S HAMLET!!!
If you got that, then you should give this movie a try.
But if you're a weak-willed PC automaton who thinks that independnet film must always laud all things PC, then you will be sorely disappointed.
In many of the scenes you end up wondering, "Oh crap, what would I do then?"
All too often you'll find films which leave something hanging, resolve it, then find something new to leave hanging only to resolve later and repeat the process.
At that point the main character, Puck, his best friend Double D, and the audience could use a jovial moment - what's more jovial then running amuck behind the espresso bar?
But then again, any movie that begins w/ a quote from GW Bush throws me for a loop.
First he is shown as the only activist present with a plan and/or any motivation towards actual change at all... And then he leads the rest of the characters in a wildly rebelious spurt of ... slapping bumper stickers on stop signs... Ohhhhh.
Anarchist's Cookbook is better categorized as a coming of age teen movie then drama or comedy.
Yes, it has a liberal bias, but then the truth is the truth, and Fox News needs to have something to counteract the falsehoods.
Ever since then, I've watched his show almost every night.
I remembered a few months later that "Serial Mom" was the first R-rated movie that I'd seen in the theaters (followed by "Backbeat", and then "Ed Wood").
It's possible that critics and/or viewers weren't so analytical back then but against that is the fact that less than a decade had passed before the Musical Queen of the Warner lot went up against the ex (just) Musical Queen of MGM.
I'm sure Warner then got the idea to do a musical for his reigning musical star of the moment Doris Day from the same era.
I mean...when I first saw this movie, I didn't wanna see it, there was nothing else on t.v., constantly zapped out of this prehistoric black&white film, tennis on 2nd channel, rubbish on Tele-5, so I finally landed on this "AhÃ­ estÃ¡ el Detalle" again, it was just beginning...I had a laugh, then one more, laughs got into outbursts of uncontrollable laughter, decided to turn on de VCR and recorded it almost wholly, I had to see it three times to get it all in (Mr. Mario Moreno talks so fast you have to listen twice) .It's the only one I liked by Cantinflas but the best comic movie I've ever seen in my life.
Of course, back then there were no 'vocal technician' actors.
Some of the slapstick may seem dated by now, but then what about 'American Pie'.
Not that he wasn't a bit younger back then.
It seems that Crisp has had his kingdom stolen from him and why he would then choose to send his son away is a bit of a mystery.
He would have been better in romances or such films as "A Kiss Before Dying"--where he very effectively played a guy who romanced and then murdered women.
Led by this unknown who desires conquest of Britain by using these collaborators; which is just what the U.S.A. and the Western World was facing up to then.
Other features seen in the Hearst "funny papers" pages then were BLONDIE, FLASH GORDON, JUNGLE JIM, HI & LOIS, MANDRAKE THE MAGICIAN,BRINGING UP FATHER(Maggie & Jiggs),THE PHANTOM, HENRY, BEETLE BAILEY and TIM TYLER's LUCK!
A typical low budget thriller/horror movie with a cast that doesn't bring much excitement to an experienced viewer, but then again not that bad either since none of them gave me the creeps.
You get a few thrills from the action scenes and after watching it I felt like I hadn't wasted a good hour and a half, but then again I could have found something else to do also without loosing a good nights sleep over missing this film.
There are a few interesting characters, and a few people show that they have acting potential, and if you get into the frame of mind where you can deal with all the large amounts of shiny computer game cgi, then there is still the problem that the movie just sucks anyways.
i thought that the director and the designers and the producer could of come up with something better then that it was awful.
The computer graphics did nothing for the film and the producer really didn't think it through, i mean the scale of the shark was just ridiculous and most of the film was in computer graphics i think in total there was bout half an hour that wasn't done by computer.You could only just tell the shark was swimming in the water and it kept blinking while it was "swimming" so since when did fish start to blink, and it was poorly made, i mean come on its the 21st century all the technology there is these days the director and the producer could have made it much better that even the shark in jaws looked more real then the Megolodon did!
Okay, 'Megalodon' is better then other films about other films such as 'Shark attack 3: Megalodon' and 'Shark Hunter'.
It will be better then most shark attack films you will ever see.
It takes about 45 minutes before we get to see the shark, so until then the viewer is bored with mediocre acting, simple character- and story building and cheap SE.
It's not original, it lacks a bit suspense every now and then, the acting is just average and you can tell that the budget was low, to name only a few things.
One of the favourite scenes is when David (Peter Dalle), after one of many quarrels with Marie (Lena Endre), smashes the TV-set he just bought in the street and then gets arrested by the police.
I watched them and then watched them again.
At one point, he claims to be 59, but then tells about his experiences across the U.S. that happened over 70 years ago.
If Rabid was about STDs, then the Fly is about love in the face of decay.
A typical Cronebergian gem, with more layers, meanings and elements in it then you would see at first sight.
He then meets a journalist whom he shows his experiment to in action.
He then begins the slow transformation into what he calls 'Brundlefly'.
If I was going to nitpick, I might argue that baboons seem like an unnecessarily dangerous test animal for Brundle to work with (but then again, maybe they had a special on baboons at the pet store) and the scientist's uncanny ability to program a computer to recognise the poetry of flesh (as he puts it) comes a little too easy, but these are minor niggles and do very little to spoil the film as a whole.
Before we had reached the climactic scene, every one in the class had already guessed it, as we had seen images so far of a man purposely sharpening a razor blade, and then approaching a complacent woman in a chair and holding wide open one of her eyes.
In this sense, the film affects a lot like real life tragedies do, because it begins in a place truly pure and good and unsuspecting, lets its characters discover how wonderful life can be, and then Horror is unjustly, and irrevocably, forced upon them.
The pacing is excellent, starting off at a sedate pace but never becoming boring and then building up to the gory climax.
Jeff Goldblum plays Seth Brendel, a scientist and meets Veronica played by then wife Geena Davis, she is a journalist trying to find a break-through story that can make her career.
David Cronenberg's version of "The Fly" has little in common with Kurt Neumann's 1958 film of the same title, one of the cheaply made 'creature-features' of the 1950sÂ Instead, it reveals many of the director's obsessionsÂ   Jeff Goldblum is Seth Brundle, a Mad Scientist who is working on 'teleporting', a means of transporting objects through spaceÂ Geena Davis is Veronica Quaife, a magazine writer who becomes interested in his work, and in himÂ They start an affair, but Seth believes Veronica is still seeing her former loverÂ In a rage he tries to transport himself, and his genes become caught up with a fly that gets into the machineÂ Slowly Seth takes on the features of an insectÂ   As in other Cronenberg's films, sexuality is seen as a dangerous force that leads to disasterÂ Seth cannot get his amazing machine to transport living creatures until he has experienced the delights of sex with Veronica, but then almost immediately his jealousy leads more like a fly he develops a raging libido; the more physically repulsive he is, the more he wants sexÂ   Like many successful films of the 1980s, "The Fly" is a hybrid, fusing elements of both horror and science fictionÂ Considering that the plot is from the latter genre, the elements of fear and disgust with the human body are traditional to horrorÂ Both genres, as this film will illustrate, benefited greatly from the increasing sophistication of contemporary special effects technique, and the make-up abilitiesÂ The success of the film led to sequel in 1989, in which the son of Seth and Veronica begins to display familiar symptomsÂ
To see a man who loved life so much and finally making it in life by meeting the woman of his dreams and by succeeding in his six year goal in inventing Teleportation and then losing it all by transforming into a monster, is enough to put a tear into my eye.
The scene when Seth Brundle went smashing threw the abortion clinic window and then trying to convince Veronica (Geena Davis) not to abort his unborn baby as the baby was the only thing left of the real him, I thought was very sad and moving for Jeff Goldblums acting was so real and professional in that scene, I honestly don't think that any other actor could have played the role of Seth Brundle better than him.
Karloff comes to the island with the journalist, and then destroys the rowboat to keep everyone from escaping.
As the first victim succumbs to a mysterious illness and then his wife apparently dies of the same the general's mind becomes affected by the old ways and he falls prey to imagination.
It all then comes alive with horror relish as a premature burial {the audience are aware of this fact} brings about an upturn in pace.
We then blend seamlessly into the last quarter of the piece where the mystery and horror unfolds amid shocks and hypnotic like fulfilment.
Unfortunately, the side of the disc which houses this title is completely bare-bones: the most regrettable aspect to this Box Set, apart from the somewhat disappointing transfers (including this one), is the fact that ISLE OF THE DEAD does not have an accompanying Audio Commentary; for a rarely-seen film like THE GHOST SHIP (1943), which is not even really horror to begin with, that's quite understandable - but Karloff's involvement and the vampiric theme here should have provided ample material for discussion (is it possible there are few admirers of this one, then - Lewton himself, reportedly, considered it "a complete mess"?!
This one starts off as a war movie, then moves to what appears as a horror film when they land on the island (an island cemetery - not too hard to imagine for Greece).
Then it becomes a psychological mystery followed closely by what seems to be a vampire movie - but then it changes to what appears to be a faith vs science story.
Every now and then though I find a rating that just absolutely mystifies me.
), an ex-pat archaeologist who has been there for over a decade (he's probably had NO opportunity to pick up ANY of the language then, eh?)
IF you do that, then Erin is what a woman was classically considered to be; dependant, in search of a man, hedging her bets to be with the man most apt to provide for her.
But, if you are looking for an entertaining film, based on a true story with plenty of sound messages and great role models for your children; then this is the movie for you.
You'll pay then...or else!"
They grow up together and then go their separate ways.
After all, he was married to Carole Lombard and then was about to marry Jean Harlow when she died tragically.
There is some cheese and then there's some ham (in fact there is no shortage of ham in this film) and then there's some chicken when certain persons lose their courage and then there's some lettuce to brighten and pretty things up a bit, and then there's the daily bread, it's all there.
The floating head is the funniest thing I've ever seen, also how the kid holds from the beard and then flies to far away in the floating head... the cheap steroids are amazing, i definitely recommend this part if you want to laugh really really hard, if you smoke weed, you must watch this with all your friends and have an amazing time.

I believe it has a lot better plot then lots of late American kids movies.
It was more impressive back then, I must admit.
Still, I remember that I was awed by the invisibility cloak, have the "Mio, my Mio" tune stuck in my head now in then - the one that gets played on the pipes sticks there too at times - and frightened by the ending battle scene.
if you are tired of watching Hollywood movies which are pretty much always the same thing over and over then you should try this, it's a very unique story... maybe will be hard to understand because of the differences from the Asian culture, but I believe even for them this movie was unique...
You gotta see then feel!
If you are the kind of person who likes happy endings, with themes of comedy and romance throughout, then this is a film for you.
Regardless, BAD GUY is still a strong film if you're in the mood for a serious drama, but want something different then the regular U.S. theatrical garbage that's out there...7.5/10
Watching Sun-hwa go from the most innocent girl into the call girl that she becomes makes your heart break but then watching how she begins to feel about the Bad Guy at the end tempers this a little.
(Yes that's what I said).The themes are very dark and at the same time this is a very loving film.It is certainly a challenging film and strangely being set in South Korea has many European sensibilities.If you think the world can be explained in terms of black and white then this is not an easy film.
However if you understand that the world you live in has shades of grey then here is a multi coloured chunk to digest.I liked the central characters and found them very believable.This film shows particular skill in having very rounded supporting roles.
He roughs her up, calls her a pickpocket, and then forces her to go to a loan shark and sign an agreement (with her body as collateral) for money that he says was in the wallet.
And then comes the resolution.
She has been intimidated, then reassured, he ardent yet constrained by his feelings.
It will not be to everyone's taste, but if you are not afraid of thinking during a film then you should find plenty to take away from this one.
As said earlier, this movie is not for everyone, however if the concept sounds like something that interests you, then you should enjoy this film.
If on the other hand you don't like the idea of watching a film based on the idea of a man forcing a woman into a life of sexual servitude, then stay well away from this film.
This type of criminal(or gang-star)films have been made from 1920s, at first,probably in America, then everywhere in the world.
As for style,plenty of video-effects simply make the film like serial of music clips with no serious contents, or some kind of parody of gangster films.If one wants to show drama,tell some story,then he must select only minimum needed effects which will not irritate viewers.The first half of the film is especially bad,the second half is better(less effects), but even this fact is only an another evidence of inconsistency.
If not to mention the first four installments of the classic "Charlie Brown" theatrical features as well,which sometimes CBS would show on special holidays which included the first-ever 1969 feature,"A Boy Named Charlie Brown",then in 1972,with "Snoopy Come Home",and from there with "Race For Your Life,Charlie Brown",in 1977,and finally the last theatrical installment "Bon Voyage,Charlie Brown,And Don't Come Back",which was released in 1980.
Chuck's grandmother then calls and invites everyone over...Another great Peanuts holiday special that's as much a classic as the Great Pumpkin and Christmas one.
Snoopy then puts all the food on plates.
If you haven't seen this, then I can pretty much guarantee that you will not waste your time if the opportunity comes up.
Side note: If you enjoyed this film, then I suggest that you also watch Mind Game.
Just once or twice where I was wondering just what was happening and the silliness was to the fore I began to wonder whether it was worth the effort but then the fun begins again and the seriousness simmers.
Upon the hypnotists death, the dad is unable to recover from his hypnotism, and is forced to be bird-dad from then on.
!You are then presented to an elegant buffet of avid brights, darks and color schemes which makes his home seem like Lewis Carroll's summer house.
So do what you can to see it on the big screen, then pray for a decent DVD release.
He asks, and then his face shows great concern as he repeats after his wife: "What, the bathroom lights are out!"
Linda was probably a gold-digger who bailed the second Andy lost the belt, but fathers were very rarely awarded custody back then unless the mother was as an unfit a parent as Andy is!
He was so damn annoying throughout, but never more so than then!
But there are little moments, such as the way they hold hands walking out of the gambling joint, or the way Beery takes off his son's shoes and gets him ready for bed, then sits up and looks out the window in despair over having lost everything at the craps table.
Andy is then paid $100 to let Dink visit his mother - while there he sings a few bars of a popular song (Ruth Ettings' "Don't Tell Him What Happened to Me"), meets his step-sister Mary Lou (adorable Marcia Mae Jones) a little cutie who talks to Dink about the reality of fairy tales.
This movie tries so hard to be cute and clever that its concentrated sweetness gave me a high for about five minutes and then I crashed for the rest of it.
And then she gives off a self-satisfied smile with the hint, "You thought I was cute before, aren't you blown away by my smile?"
I do not want to speak about the plot,this you have already read in other comments around.I only want to say one thing.If you believe that people can love and give,then just go see this movie right now.You deserve it!
Every now and then movies come along that speak out to you and emotionally touch you in some way.
-If one needs more proof why foreign films are superior to American crap then look no further this gem.
But then things actually develop into this weird Hitchcock-esque story with multiple twists.
Featuring the glacial blonde Ann Todd(then Mrs. David Lean) as the real-life accused murderess Madeleine Smith, the film skillfully portrays the travail a foolish and willful young woman goes through when she follows her heart instead of her head and gets ensnared in a sticky situation.
At once we suspect her, knowing she has bought and used arsenic, but then doubt creeps back into our mind.
She then agrees to marry William Minnoch (Wooland), who has been courting her.
Adding into the mix was Madeleine's own ambivalent handling of their relationship, promising one moment to tell her father about them, then pleading it was too difficult to do so.
It's one of those movies you watch and then you just kind of forget it eventually because it wasn't very memorable.
Anyway, then one day I was at the video store (Major Video, before Blockbuster decided to buy that too) and I saw it and thought "Jaysis, there's something I need to see!"
I loved the trailer for this movie because it looked interesting and funny.I really liked the 2 leads Nick Nolte and Trevor Morgan.They work really well together and I could easily see them working together in other movies.I liked the relationship they built.Ray was estranged from his own son for reasons we don't know and David looked to Ray as a father figure since his own dad couldn't be there for him because of a disability.It isn't uncommon for males to bond this way whether it be platonic or not.Throughout history older men have often had younger male companions.Unfortunately society nowadays has to put their ugly spin on it and make assumptions.Even in the movie David's younger friends ridiculed him about spending time with the older ump even though there was nothing happening except they were developing a friendship and Dave was like a son to Ray, and I think Dave looked up to Ray and respected him and later obviously really cared about him.The only problem with this movie I had was their relationship was over as quick as it began, and it seemed there was way too much more that had to be done and said.I agree with what another person said about why even mention Dave's mother since she wasn't even in the movie period.None of her absence made sense and wasn't explained well or explored at all.Also the 2 kids turned out remarkably well for having a disabled dad and being abandoned by their mother.I didn't find that believable.And then there was this whole back story about Ray's past that got thrown in and also not explored.If these missing characters were in the movie it would be easier to understand the characters better and understand how they ended up being so broken.I mean for Chris'sakes!
And then there's the doll.
Put it this way: If Jaws kept swimmers out of the water, then Little Erin Merryweather surely will keep your fingernails clean.
Unlike French farce this Hispanic farce relies on a single device: man dates three women all discover this then fall over each other to first get him for themselves, then a subplot involving criminals, then strong women emerge.
And then, back to the storyline of the movie!
This movie is like any sketch extracted from Lente loco or any other TV show made by latin people in the spanish spoken networks in the USA -if you've ever had the misfortune of tuning in any, then you'll know what I mean-, but, an hour and plus long.
And if you can't make those gags work in a five minutes range, then guess what happens when you stretch them way beyond their boundaries.
It is cool to see a Romantic Comedy have an all Latin cast and it was good to see Latinas being successful in life, rather then just being a maid or some illegal.
The fourth character was for a teenager named Taha played by (Mohamed Imam)a son of the doorman who got engaged to a poor girl (Hend Sabry)who lives on the roof & he tried to enter the police academy but was refused for being a son of the door man .Entering another faculty & meeting some weird religious people made him change his view in life & leave his beard then participates in a demonostration where he is arrested & then being raped & tortured to death behind bars turns his decent character to a terrorist trying to get revenge from the police officer who caused him all his pains & the ending is a real sorrow .
Special lines and scenes are added for Zaky el dessouki (Adel emam) only because he's a famous comedian and the audience would like him to throw a joke every now and then although it's totally unnecessary,Taha's (Mohamed emam) clothes are not of his social class in anyway!
No matter what you say about gays, Khaled El Sawy faces the difficult task of making you hate him and then sympathize with him as he recalls the lack of attention he got from his parents that caused him to become a gay.
Yakobean building was built by Hagoub Yakobean the greatest of the Armenians in Egypt in 1937, since then, different kinds and cultures of people lived in that building, Princes and Princesses, bashas, Rich and Tycons, foreigners, Officers of revolution, Ordinary people and even Jews.
it is a pure masterpiece and if i was running the Oscars then that movie will sure receive one.
if you miss this movie then you will spend your entire life regretting it so i advice every Arabic and non-Arabic speaker to watch the masterpiece and enjoy the art of this marvelous director whom i have a great respect for.

It gets nasty, and then the camera shrinks away.
Perhaps the fact that this film is now 59 years old and what was arguably fast-moving then now veers toward the pedestrian draws attention to this basic flaw.
Cotter then gets involved with another woman, the daughter of a wealthy businessman and after the couple get married and jealous Holiday discovers who killed her brother, Cotter's problems start to escalate alarmingly.
She takes it up to a hundred to scare him, and then he stamps his foot on hers and takes it to 110 whilst she frantically swerves.
After being given a run down of what will happen to them now that they've been caught, Eddie then offers to let the girls go if they'll agree to give him a free ride - which invariably leads to a torrent of abuse for the girls.
Oh, yeah, then there's the poor girl on a chain in "the best room in the hotel".
I am great fan of Jess Franco (especially of his earlier works), and had "Mansion of the Living Dead" been directed by someone else, it might not have its certain undeniable charm - then again, it is not really imaginable for anyone else to come up with an outrageously nonsensical production such as this one.
And yes well, then there are some of the sex sequences that literally come out of nowhere often and show absolutely nothing.
Personally I prefer it when he leaves out the sex altogether, but even then (as is the case with 'Mansion of the Living Dead') he's so ham fisted in his approach that he generally ruins any element of horror there might've been.
Geoffrey backs him up 100 percent and is the test pilot for Mitchells aircraft.However tragedy is just around the corner when (after working flat out without sleeping or eating)Mitchell feels unwell and consults a Dr who tells him if he does not stop he will die in just a year.Will Mitchell ignore the advice or heed it?well if you read about him you will know if you don't know the story then watch this wonderful film.David and Leslie have a great chemistry and play their parts well a must see film about an important part of British history.
It was the ending, with his now-middleaged RAF officer taking to the air in person and then pursuing the German pilot who had shot down one of his squadron-mates.
Enjoy it like I did, but if there are any R.A.F or aviation buffs out there and would like to know more about the Spitfire and it's history, the glory of the air racing days of the 20's and 30's or just more factual information about the great man himself, then I suggest you visit www.rjmitchell-spitfire.co.uk
Not sure if the film would break down into a series of submissive gestures, I felt a little un-easy recommending it, but then I saw the ending.
But if you'd like to know something about isolation among city-dwellers in Taiwan, and something more universal about city alienation and romantic yearning, then watch this film immediately.
A plumber attempts to locate the source of the problem, then disappears after creating a large hole in the floor.
They just look pondering into the camera for a moment or two (three, ten) and then take action.
It makes me wonder if Paul Anderson saw this movie as a kid and then subconsciously recreated it later.
Good, smart twist at the end makes the movie even better then expected.
It was her first film for the cinema and then it was nominated for the golden globe.
I saw this movie and then I read the Popular Mechanic's debunking.
2.Why would the US government fire a cruise missile into the Pentagon, and then say it was attacked by a passenger plane?
Why not just blow up the WTC with bombs in the first place (with no planes crashing into them), and then claim it was a terrorist attack (of which they have proof)???
But if the conspiracy theorists are correct, then who flew those planes into the WTC?
If they were driven by an autopilot (as some people claim), then how can you explain the frantic phone calls of the passengers to their families???
Until then, I still fondly give it a 10.
if you believe that the government had something to do with 9/11, then you might find it pretty true.
but if you think it's bologna, and you want to check for actual facts like me, then you'll find it has a lot of mistakes in it, which is BIG when it comes to an even like 9/11.
Watch it with an open mind and question it but if you have already come to a conclusion that this film is a farce then avoid it and God help you.
The man is a college student or dropout - he has no experience in the world (but then again neither do you CT's).
If all what is in this "documentary" is correct, then we can assume that the government is "all powerful" and "all knowing".
Conspiracy theorists: do you actually think that the US-Government planned all this, and then somehow got the thousands of FBI-agents, fire-fighters, demolition-experts, scientists, CIA, rescue-workers, NSA, airline pilots, Police, the house of representatives, high-level military contractors, air-traffic controllers and the whole Bush-administration to keep this big secret??
Because if Conspriacy theories are not challenged at every given moment, then they turn into fact for most people.
But they don't care if they have evidence of their claims or not, as long as USA is responsible for 9/11, then they are happy.
If the CIA planned 9/11, to make the war on terror, then the Arabs must have been patsies.
But then why was the Arabs from Saudi Arabia????
If the CIA and American Government is so powerful as the Conspiracy Theorists claim, then they made the Arabs come to America to be in the Planes.
But then why from Saudi Arabia, if USA after-wards waged war against Afghanistan and Iraq??
If the CIA was so powerful as the conspiracy theorists claim, then they would made Iraqies and Afghans go into those planes, because then they would have a greater argument to attack the Arab-countries in the so-called war on terror, especially Iraq.
The typical Conspiracy theorists, when working on a conspiracy theory, starts with the conclusion, and then works from there, choosing the evidence that can fit the theory and discarding and ignoring all facts and evidence that contradicts the overall theory.
The technology in question is just a new technology, that CANT be used live, it has to be used on a recording, and even then it is not 100 % accurate.
Also if they copied their voices, then they must have had all these many passengers, all of them mind you, under surveillance for months.
And then think of how complex this plan is: monitoring hundreds of people, making sure that none of the thousands of pilots, airport-personal, CIA, NSA, FBI, Policemen, firemen and citizens didn't talk.
If just one of these factors didn't work, then the whole operation fell??
If the video tapes from the nearby buildings were just released straight away, then there would be no controversy, as they could have blown the Pentagon attack as a missile out of the water.
If the FDR was uncovered and released to the press, then it would blow their theory out of the water.
If they come back and tell you "Wow, this was amazing; it opened up my eyes; the gov't did 9/11", then your friends are either A) idiots, or B) dishonest... in either case, this movie is an incredibly effective tool to let you know who not to bother hanging around.
Conspiracy theorists, when they are making their conspiracy theory, starts with the conclusion and then works his or her way from there.
About 9/11:   If USA planned 9/11, then why haven't a single person from the Police, Fire fighters, NSA-, FBI, CIA, Military, Air-traffic-control-people, most of the house of representatives, demolition-experts, Scientists, rescue-workers and the whole Bush-administration squealed and told the world about the largest mass-murder in modern American History?
Also, if the USA planned it, then why did they use 19 men from Saudi-Arabia???
If people from Iraq would had been in the airplanes 9/11, then the "war on terror" would have been more easy to justify.
And if this USA-Shadow-Government planned 9/11, then they would not have used 19 Saudies.
I ask a good friend, who travelled a lot back then (Buisness).
You could speak in air-planes back then, the problem was that the calls was cut-off, when the plane went away from a transmitter on the ground.
Plus you have to have many recordings of the original voices, and then calibrate the equipment to do morph voices.
So if you think about it, then the government would have to have tail all the passengers of flight 93 for several months before 9/11, if you take Dylan Avery's word.
And Dylan Avery claims that these supposedly CIA-agents used this voice-morph-technology to call the families of the passengers of flight 93, and then sounded so convincing, talking just like them, using the words they use, accents and favourite-curse-words and all, and then convinced all the families of the passengers of flight 93?
If you try to do this yourself, think about how to do it, then you'll see how impossible it is.
The journalists had reports that about 20 planes had been captured, then 8 planes.
If you do not hold your head cool during this film, then you will be taken in by the lies of this documentaries.
Joseph Goebbels once said: "If you tell a lie, which is sufficiently big and keep repeating it, then people will at believe it is the truth in the end".
If the gov't has got nothing to hide then why can't we see all the evidence that we the American public has a right to.
If you knew what the Bush family has invested in the middle east then you know that is a big enough motivation for them to kill anyone in this world.
That's why the old Bush went to war in the middle east and then the young Bush went to war in the middle east.
It really, really aggravates me to hear them mocking the victims of 9/11 - and then they have the audacity to dedicate the movie to them afterward.
Shot in Ottawa, Canada, "Decoys" hits every bad cliche in the book and then pulls one of classic bad movie mistakes:  It takes itself seriously.
But then as now there are malevolent forces in the world and they are in this story Yul Brynner and his pirate crew.
The script isn't very good either, why would someone during a talent show turn up with a flamethrower, shoot a jet of flame at the crown & then just leave?
I suppose if your looking for a dull teen drama with a few touches of sci-fi & horror then Decoys might be the film you have been waiting for, if not then there are much better alternatives out there that deserve your time & money more.
If it did then Decoys is even more of a disappointment when the amount of money the makers had to play with is taken into consideration.
If you get a chance give this one a watch, even though you may have seen this type of story before, it's more fun then you may think.
The girls do better acting wise, but then again, they act as the standard clichÃ© eye-candy too.
A sense of urgency then takes over until the final outcome.
It dragged on for the first hour, until Gwyneth was "ready" to have her baby, then you think the excitement might set in.
Now we know Gwennie is all alone without any family other then her future hubby.
Incidentally, Oxytocin is rendered useless in the digestive system and is only effective if absorbed through the mucous membranes or given intravenously, and even then has a half life of 3 minutes I believe, so it would be totally useless taken in food.
Also if my mother-in-law had treated me like that when I was in labour and then tried to kill me with a lethal injection I would not have stayed in the house even for a dramatic denouement the next morning.
** The end is the worst: Jackson got very close to his mother - then one morning Helen tells him she tried to kill her, and he immediately believes her, changes his mind and decides to leave.
This is a film to watch with friends after having a few drinks, then one might enjoy the "masterpiece" some avid fans thought "Hush" was.
She lost both her parents, was mugged in her own home and then stands up to her Mother-In-Law to prove to her husband what an evil person his mother is.
BUT, after 1001 warning signs AND when he then tries to kill two people (by beating one with a fireplace poker and then trying to stab another), you'd think the kid would have been deported or arrested or even shot!
I have never heard of it until then.
It started out very different and then I was shocked to see how the family memebers were treating each other.
In the case of his future aunt Leona the fact that she's Jewish is enough to drive Emil batty in thinking that he'll be forced to live under the same roof as she is when she marries his Uncle Mike: a fate worse then death itself for the cute but somewhat not all there in the head little Nazi.
What then follows is some of the worst direction, acting, editing and photography you will ever have the misfortune to witness.
I'll run away for ten seconds then not be able to find my way back, even though I have a torch and a radio.
Jang Geum then trained to be a Medical Lady, because it was the only way a slave-servant can enter the palace.
From then on, it had got me intrigued.
The medical knowledge that Jang Geum has later on in the serial is really impressive but then at times, it got her into trouble as well.
Not hooked but enough interest to keep me going...same with the next one...and then when I finally got to the part when the little Jang Geum became orphaned and out-shone the other little girls in the palace in her determination and diligence, that is when I really got hooked, which brings me to a suggestion ... watch the first 3 episodes in their entirety.
If you are still only on the sideline not sure to continue or not after watching episode 3, then you should probably stop watching (really unthinkable to me but I suppose it is possible).
Well...i rented this movie only because i needed a second movie to rent at the video store and this one promised a dollar back if returned the next day...now i know why..they knew no one would want to keep this poor excuse of a movie in their house for more then a day.
Please dont do like i normally do and rent the movie despite the bad review, when i say this movie sucks worse then having a dog p*ss on the leg of your best dress slacks...i mean it!
"Prepare your self then.
kvetches the brat) and then Sheen has to swallow endless abuse and innuendo from the little creep, who (let's face it) knew the score from the moment he saw his 'father' living in the same house with this other guy.
While portraying homosexuals was a brave career move (back then) for both Hal and Martin, I thought Scott stole the show!
I just wish we could have talked more about the subject matter back then.
If you enjoy fast-pace action-drama and character-driven stories, then highly recommend Player 5150 as it delivers.
It was better than Mad about You then and is now.
It's a shame that shows do not have the quality it once had like it did then.
However, I think that if we consider different alternatives to what movies can be, then this is definitely something worth watching.
And then filmed during each actors day off at their actual paying jobs?
He takes a reporter (Pritchard) back and forth in time, then also a swarmy businessman.
Until then, my rating is 4.
You get in on the tail end of the sex and then some brief nudity and a few cute one liners from Savini.
The people I want to see more of only have brief scenes and then there's those that annoy me to no end that we have to see for the whole film.
The movie then goes into all these different and sometimes intersecting stories that add up to a bunch of Z grade actors getting killed by zombies.
If it's by young people then this movie is OK.
