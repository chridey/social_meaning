It is one those programmes that you start to watch and can not get enough of as i said i hope they make a third series.
I like it that the bad guys won, they just were not clear enough about it, probably because they wanted to have some room for a third season, fir me just another 20-30 minutes to end it properly would do.. maybe just showing a scene of angels and demons battling each other in front of the burning school and Leon and Thelma hiding in the forest where we left them, crying of fear and failure over Ellas dead body.. and then suddenly meeting old friends (Cassie, Amy, Max, Roxanne, Tom, etc) and everybody then slowly goes away to heaven(or maybe hell) together (a semi happy ending, at least for our main characters getting the chance to meet and be together in the afterlife at least) A scene where Azazel, Raphael and Mephistopheles having a last drink together sitting quiet together seemingly contemplating their bitter and unhappy fates, of course with a close up on a tear falling from Azazels check before everything erupts into light/chaos, could be a kind of fitting/funny final scene   anyway I really enjoyed this show.

Emlyn Williams is top-billed and co-star Anna Konstam appeared in only a handful of films including Waterloo Road before falling off the radar for some 30 years but the film is unbalanced in the last third by a tour de force from Ernest Thesiger in what is clearly a prototype Waldo Lydecker - there is even a facial resemblance especially in the mouth between Thesiger and Clifton Webb; both are aesthetes and both killers.

The story worked with the assistance of Dudley Moore as a befuddled not-so-innocent third party who gets dragged into the proceedings by Hawn, Eugene Roche as a conspirator, Billy Barty as an accidental victim of Hawn's fears and hysteria, and Burgess Meredith and Rachel Roberts having an unexpected classic judo face off.
Chase plays it dry and Hawn is a loose pin, but it's the crackling chemistry between them that really works wondersÂ and the third party of Charles Grodin caps it off nicely.
The third time I watched it I found it to be extremely funny.
This movie is imperfect (it sags a bit in the third quarter, and some major factors in the plot are unexplained or confusing), but it is a great mix of fear and excitement.

The third of Ray Harryhausen's Sinbad films has apparently gotten a bad rap over the years, which I can not understand.

The first Species movie was awesome, the second was a big disappointment, the third was surprisingly decent, but this is even worse than the second...somehow.
After the first half hour, I must admit I thought this movie would actually be as good as the third.

In this case, third time's a clunker.
Roland Young reprises his role as "Topper," that poor man who sees ghosts, in this third "Topper" movie; the TV show would have Leo G. Carroll in the title role.
The third entry in the series, then, gave the formula an ingenious twist by marrying it with the popular old dark house-type of film.
For the third and final Topper film, Roland Young is now shed of the Kirbys from the two previous films and he and Billie Burke are now starting on a needed vacation with Eddie Anderson as chauffeur and Patsy Kelly as maid.
This was the third of a 3-film series, coming after TOPPER (1937) and TOPPER TAKES A TRIP (1939).
Topper Returns is the third and last of the Topper series, all of which starred Roland Young as the lead and Billie Burke as his annoying wife.
This third film adds an element of mystery, suspense and chills to the comedy.
First half or so into the movie,you are hooked and quite entertained,but after the interval,the film slowly drags,since the plot becomes weak and it's going in one direction; so there isn't much to tell.Subplots are added to compensate the running time.In other words,it could've trimmed a little more of the length and finished it quickly.That would've made the film perfect.But it gets boring as it drags the story and adds subplot and makes the whole of second half contrived.But the third act,which is the big revelation of who is behind the whole scenario,somewhat pays off with satisfaction.
this is the second filmed version of Richard Matheson's novel,I am Legend,the first being The Last Man on Earth,starring Vincent price,and the third bearing the same title as the novel and,starring Will Smith.i really enjoyed the first version,and pretty much hated the third version.this version is,much closer to the third version,in terms of my opinion of it.i found a lot of this movie lame,lacking in any real excitement.the acting was pretty poor(though Heston wasn't too bad).i also felt the movie was a bit too talky at times,and there is no real air of mystery to the story.having said that,there was one good thing about it.this one had a plot,(as slow as it was)which i felt the third one didn't.it was just this side of boring,for the most part,occasionally slipping over into the area of boredom.i was able to get through it.but i wouldn't care if i never saw it again.it just really didn't anything for me.my vote for The Omega Man is a 3/10
This was the second time around for I AM LEGEND; perhaps the third time will be the charm...

By the third segment things have gone downhill considerably, as Harry is a drunk who has a reunion with an old friend (who has also fallen on hard times) and for "old time-sake" they steal a body from an ambulance and find that it's a beautiful young woman, and things degenerate from there.
The third and final chapter sees the once bright young boy as a drunken waster who cuts a stark contrast to the boy we saw in both the first and second chapters of the film.

In the third part, situated in the 1970's we see him again.
But that 'problem' was easily overcome by the second and the third part.
The same about the third part, although this story is something completely different from the second.
In the third act we get a more literal adaptation of Bukowsky's THE COPULATING MERMAID OF VENICE, CA., when Harry is a down-on-his-luck alcoholic, devoid of any aspirations, spending most of his time in shady bars.

The lead performance by Josse de Pauw who plays the adult Harry in the second and third acts, is a joy to watch.
Only the third part is based on the short story "The copulating mermaid of Venice, California" by Charles Bukowski.

This film is actually the third entry in the Sorority House Massacre series, but stands just fine on its own (I've never seen the two preceding SHMs).
I started watching it during the third season, then Kate Jackson left.
Maybe because these were the only episodes that were focused on a single Angel, Kelly and Jill, respectively, rather than the others which were group efforts...) Kate was excellent and extremely compelling as Sabrina Duncan, Farrah was quite good (sometmes mesmerizing) as the fun-loving, athletic, charming flirt Jill Munroe (I have always thought her comedienne skills could have been tapped into more) and Jaclyn was beyond lovely and sweet as Kelly Garrett, the perfect third banana.
By the third season, the producers and everyone else involved (sans the actresses) figured that because the ratings had not slipped, then the success of the show had nothing to do with quality, because the third season's episodes were mostly not very good, sometimes pretty bad.
The first third of the film is perhaps a little slow and episodic, but does successfully reveal the characters of Peterson and Vasco to the viewer (with fantastic character play by Nero and Milian respectively).
The third order of control involves secondary institutions -- the police, psychiatrists, or, quien sabe?, the National Security Agency.

The film does drag a bit in the last third or so, and the great character actress Beulah Bondi is essentially wasted in a small role as Sofia's tutor, but Price carries the film, and the last shot, reminiscent to me of the last moments of 'The Lives of Others' carries a powerful emotional punch.
A rough as guts Leone at a third of the running time, one-fiftieth of the cost and with a script rewritten buy a team of monkeys on typewriters, but a Leone film nonetheless.
Mantan Moreland shows his best Vaudevillian stage takes, and of note is Joan Woodbury, the Woodbury soap heiress, in at least her third appearance in the Chan series.
The first third of the movie involves the two of them and I have to say that in the mouths of players less skilled than these two, Robert Sherwood's dialog would have sounded like so much romantic drivel.
the things that were definite drawbacks and did Not make sense were more mundane; the cops have a very laissez-faire attitude towards their guns(and even More annoying,each time it's an obvious Portent Of Doom :P ),those dippy cops also missed a handful of important and somewhat obvious clues at first glance(even second and third glance).
This is the third series of Miss Marple and if you have watched the previous seasons of Miss Marple, you have probably realized they're not that faithful, I don't mind that at all, because they ( and this one is no exception ) are great entertainment.

The series, however, goes off the rails in the third hour.
All in all I just can't believe that they actually made a third movie after this.

It is easier to watch a second or third time if you give it the chance, then you seem to be able to concentrate on the savage humour without feeling too much pity for the put upon characters involved.
The third season was great, but didn't quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2.

After having enjoyed the first two episodes of "Kingpin," I was a bit disappointed in the third installment of the series, although it had its moments, the canine shootings not being among them.
Unbelievably, at least to me, "Kingpin" finished third in its timeslot, as it appears that the networks can continue to feed the masses predictably lame, tired and predictable programming and the herd will flock to it as if it were Aunt Bea's homemade apple pie.
The acting was third rate, and the emotion, forced.
The script lacks the closure of a third act; we are left hanging thinking there needed to be something more.
I suppose some kind of Lord of the Flies metaphor is implied by the boy-savage who menaces the leads in the first third, but without connecting this to WHY civilisation has ended and WHY people are reacting the way they are, the message goes nowhere.
Dragon Head (based on a manga of the same name) starts off like Your run of the mill train wreck movie with two teenagers teaming up up to escape the carnage as well as a totally flipped out third teen only to discover the World that they knew has all but been wiped out by an horrific disaster leaving only an almost deserted waste land where even the Sun is blocked from view by volcanic ash actually raining down to Earth like thick snow.

I purchased this as an old rental VHS tape from an Amazon third party vendor, hoping that it would be a gem in the rough.
Appreciate the asymmetrical rhythm that shunts Malkovich and ladies mostly to the film's final third.
Incidentally, neither title â American (which places an emphasis on the gambling subplot which comes into play only during the last third) or original, which roughly translates to FOUR GUNMEN OF AVE MARIA â is really satisfactoryâ¦but, then, neither is the film itself: one isnât bothered by the sluggish pacing and extreme length of Leoneâs Spaghetti Westerns, but that certainly canât be said here!
Chuck Jones's 'No Barking' was the third in a trilogy of cartoons starring a character called Frisky Puppy.

***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The first Godzilla movie in the third movie series, whereas GODZILLA VS. DESTOROYAH, the previous entry, aptly ended the second series.
With their third generation of "Godzilla" films being kicked off with this flashy new movie, Toho continued a trend that was seen in generation two, where they discard the events of the previous Godzilla incarnation and instead start with the original 1954 "Godzilla" and work from there.
The special effects in this third generation "Godzilla" film seem to actually be a step back too.
Tony Todd co-produced and appears for a third time as candy-man in Day Of The Dead as the scary man with the bad handshake.
I walked in to the third act of a three-act play.
Unfortunately this is yet another case of third movie blues as ÂCandyman: Day of the Dead' soon becomes a virtually intolerable bore of a horror movie with little redeeming features.
The third part in a horror series canÂ´t be that good (the only exception being Scream 3), it just canÂ´t.
In this third installment there is no good acting.
The third movie of the once promising Candyman myth.
This third iteration is a bland, horribly acted, complete waste of time.
while i actually liked the first two Candyman movies,i didn't' like this third and(so far Final)installment.i found it boring and repetitive and i didn't like the story very much.there's a lot of filler here,which suggests to me that the filmmakers didn't have enough of a story for a complete movie.i also wasn't too impressed with the acting.there was a lot of overwrought theatrics.as well,there were some things in this movie that did not fit with the previous movies,basically throwing out certain aspects of the lore.maybe i'm just imagining things,but this is my opinion on things.finally,this movie has none of the style of the second movie.adding it all up,this third installment in the series is much lower in quality on all counts.my vote for Candyman 3:Day of the dead is a 3/10
'Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers', 'A Nightmare On Elm Street 2', 'Childs Play 3', and 'Candyman 3' all have something in common.If you're thinking that they're all sequels, you are right, but there's something else.All of these movies are examples of underrated sequels.I liked all of these movies and I don't care what other people have to say about them.I thought that 'Candyman 3: Day of the Dead' was a pretty decent horror movie with another groundbreaking performance by Tony Todd.Nobody will ever play a better Candyman than him.That's a fact that we horror fans should know.I haven't seen the 2nd movie yet, but I do have to say that the first and the third were pretty good.Maybe the third wasn't as good as the first, but I still found it to be a good movie.After you're finished reading my review, I want you to go to a mirror and say Candyman 5 times.If he shows up and tries to kill you, then it serves you right for thinking that this movie was totally pointless.If the Candyman franchise wants to be really popular, then there needs to be a 4th installment.Let's hope that Tony Todd is willing to play Candyman again.
?It wasn't inevitable that a third Candyman film would be made (highly likely,in fact) or that the Candyman franchise would branch out into the video market,but,all the same,what a mess...
The third character is Rhys Ifans, one of the newer actors & He will be a top draw performer very soon, (Think of a younger Christopher Walkin).
The film does fall a little flat in the third act, with a fairly predictable ending that feels more positive and "Hollywood" than a great noir usually should, but it's a nice entry and there aren't too many wasted moments in the 73-minute running time.
But the execution is what raises the bar here, particularly in the first third when the police bring in all the usual suspects.
The film does briefly give into sentimentality at the end Â though very, very begrudgingly Â and it's never quite as good as that powerhouse first third, but it's certainly a sharp punch below the belt to the cop movie that you won't forget in a hurry.
For the first third of the film, the script is obtuse, confusing, and disconnecting -- as it should be, considering that we may as well be taking the point of view of someone who just arrived on a train and entered the gates of hell.
As a bonus, the third performance in film, by the then 8 year old Natalie Wood, as an adorable little blond Austrian exile girl.
I can hardly wait for the third part of the trilogy.
Unfortunately their second track was Bad a song I've never taken to and Bono spent so much time jumping into the audience to get a girl to dance with him that they had to scrap their third track Pride .
Major disappointment aside I still stayed in to watch the rest of the concert most of which I watched on my sister's portable black and white TV and it wasn't until a few days later that I started digesting what a monumental event it was where Queen stole the show with their medley , where Bob Geldof swore live on air ( In those days bad language on television was still very rare ) , the dominance of British music that saw every act at Wembly hail from the British Isles and where a third of the acts at the American concert were also British , and the strange fact within a couple of years many of the acts at Wembly had disappeared from the charts altogether .
What's brilliant about this film, however, is that about a third of the way through, it rips the unwritten contract between filmmaker and audience in half.
Wolfgang uses his own technical wizardry to bring this vision to life and together with a third friend Darren (Jason Presson) they design a craft that takes them into outer space where they have a close encounter.
Remarkably the film still holds up well even though it's a movie primarily aimed at children, however the film is really brought down by the third act.
Still despite this it does have a good first half and the message in the third act is interesting even if it's hidden under bad joke and horrible dialog.

A third Hitchcock film, "The Birds", was also based on her work).
"The Third Man" is a flawless film of intrigue and suspense, a summit of perfection within the genreÂ It is one of the most literate thrillers ever madeÂ It is superb1y acted by an ensemble working in an understated, effortless styleÂ Its cinematography includes some of the best black-and-white work ever doneÂ Its score of haunting zither music is still remembered, instantly familiar to anyone who ever saw the film, and now thorough1y identified with most people's impressions of ViennaÂ Finally, the direction by Carol Reed is exemplaryÂ Rarely has a motion picture represented the collaboration of so many exceptional talents... "The Third Man" may be the greatest film made in Britain since World War IIÂ   The night city terrain of "The Third Man" is unique: occupied postwar Vienna, baroque, bombed-out, decadent, patrolled by Jeeps containing representatives of the four occupying powers, an American, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and a RussianÂ  Corrupt, world-weary people hang about its fringes: the overly suave Rumanian, Popescu; the frayed violinist, Baron Kurtz; the atheistic collector of Catholic antiquities, Dr. Winkel; Crabbit, the tired head of the Anglo Cultural Center; and Anna Schmidt, the Czechoslovakian girl friend of Harry Lime, an obscure actress with forged papersÂ   Moving among them are three extraordinary principals, Holly Martins, a typical Greene creation; a hack American writer; a used- up second-rater; Colonel Calloway, a Scotland Yard type, chief of British Military Police; and Harry Lime (WeIles), the corrupt two-bit racketeer, a fully immoral, totally unreachable villainÂ   These characters wander through rain-slick night streets, in and out of shabby cafÃ©s, over the rubble of bombed-out buildings, even into a terrain vague dominated by a huge Ferris wheelÂ  The Vienna of "The Third Man" is a vast city that seems emptyÂ Its streets are always damp, and water rushes through a system of sweet-smelling sewers underneathÂ It is a world of slinking cats and biting parrots, of people taking advantage of each other without pityÂ   "The Third Man" meets the test of complexityÂ The characters interact, their stories conflict: A man who is supposed to be dead turns up alive, there is a question of whether two men or a "third man" carried off Lime's "body," there are conspiracies, deceits, and double crossesÂ   Reed owes debts to Fritz Long for some of his ideas: the geometrical shots, the montage of evidence, Welles' whistling, etc., but Reed has his own original visual style, particularly his use of a slightly tilted camera to produce so-called "Chinese angles," employed to project danger, foreboding, a twisted universeÂ He is also capable of providing suspense in the tradition of HitchcockÂ   "The Third Man" is unique in the genre for its realismÂ Despite the complexities of plot, the characters are understandable, dimensional, emotionally genuineÂa tribute to the fine ensemble playing and special, low-keyed acting style that is the cinematic equivalent of Graham Greene's writingÂ  Carol Reed was knighted for his excellence as a British filmmaker, and for a body of work that is notable for its good tasteÂ It is this taste, of course, that works so well in "The Third Man," but which has destroyed some of his other films, such as "Our Man in Havana," which require a certain amount of excess to make them workÂ
Michael Douglas is excellent as always, Gwyneth Paltrow vulnerable and gorgeous as the wife and newcomer Viggo Mortensen is suitably oily and cunning as the third member of the triangle.
Oliver Hardy is the third part of this delightful three-some.
(I won't give a spoiler -- if you're like me you'll have guessed the ending 10 minutes prior based on the question "How would a third rate Lifetime Original Movie end?")
(The third starred Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and is nearly as good.)
I've been waiting for the moment when I'd finally see the third installment of the Crow saga.
Its third outing however (the Crow: Salvation) i enjoyed.
If you watch the films in order you can truly see how much better the third installment is.i give it 7/10
Bottom line with this movie is this: Eric Mabius makes an enthralling third crow, yeah Kirsten Dunst is pretty and all but she misses as much as she hits acting wise and the director knew this so she doesn't spend too much time overdoing the comic book heroine thing.
Well keep on remembering, because you'll get NONE of that in this, the third installment of sequels that should've stopped before they began.
This third film takes the plot of the first film, bastardizes it, and tries to regurgitate it in this insanely stupid film.
Eric Mabius looks great as the third Crow and Kirsten Dunst acts brilliantly as Lauren Randall's sister.
yes you read that right I love these movies the only reason I haven't watched The Crow: City Of Angels (1996) is that I cannot find it no matter where I go this villain is one of those "I want him to die" villains I also had never ever heard of these actors (which they were very good) besides Kirsten Dunst which we all know from Spiderman (this movie is way better) now the plot is The third entry in 'The Crow' series follows Alex Corvis, who was framed for the murder of his girlfriend and is executed.
For the third Crow outing, I was left feeling rather skeptical of watching this considering the disaster with City of Angels?
This is the third film in a Rock and Roll series that also includes "Ferry Cross the Mersey" on Friday, 9/18/09 at 7:30 pm, and "The Big TNT Show" on Saturday, 9/19 at 7:30 pm.
A few years ago, I find myself travelling through South-East Asia, at one point trying to piece together a baffling series of events that resulted in the genocide of a third of Kampuchea, or Cambodia as we now call it.
Millions died Â estimates say around a third of the population, two to three million.
Could a third sequel be made?
Hans Weingartner's third movie is a harsh but highly legitimate comment on today's television program.
The last third of the film is mostly taken up by the gynaecologist going about his business, inserting diaphragms, coils and caps into various young women or advising them to go onto the pill.
The third murder is of a man we know, the expected murder, expected by Frank and by another detective (John Goodman's character Detective Sherman Touhey from Queens).
Keller & Sherman check out the third person Raymond Brown, Michael O'Neill, who placed a poem in the paper looking for both love and companionship and their told by Raymond that he never followed up on the responses that he got from the women who got in touch with him.
When there is a third case, Frank convinces his chief to write for the magazine and work undercover investigating the women that reply the advertisement.
There is a third part, a kind of celebratory black and white interval made up of Che's speech at the United Nations in 1964 and interviews with him at that time, but that is inter-cut in the first segment.
They have taken the view that winning is the end-all and be-all of living, and that second or third or fourth place in the standings is worthless.
When I was maybe thirteen or so I lent this too a friend and he lost the third disc so for a long time I was replaying the first two discs or just crushing Ultimecia as best I could in the finale of the game.
Spawning a need for more gay political leaders, the legislation fuels a grassroots movement to obtain a larger political influence which in the third beat, may or may not turn out the way the viewer would expect.
Giger, who compares the alien suit design in Alien 3 to a piece of excrement, and Lance Henriksen talking about how the third film destroyed all the work that was put into the first two entries, it sheds a whole new perspective on what it was like for the cast and crew to experience these films.
Joe's grateful pal provides Joe with a tip about Harris' whereabouts through a third party.
He gets the third degree from the police, before they find out his alibi is checking out.
It has an excellent global rather than US or British focus and covers everything from the roots of metal to all it's various past and present incarnations with almost all of the information coming from either band members themselves, fans or interested third parties from various academic backgrounds.
However overall I feel Season 2 was a good Season, and it is deeply sad that a third season never got past the drawing board stages.
It's Flynn's third appearance with sword in hand for Warner Brothers after Captain Blood and Charge of the Light Brigade.
Now this first gore scene was possibly the third best effect in the movie.
One, the big reveal that starts off the third act is a really good concept.
Has the boring and embarrassing third one destroyed all that was memorable about the first two?
Well...other than the fact that Bronson Pinchot (who stole the show in the first and third movies as the hilarious Serge) doesn't make an appearance.
Sergei bodrov is legendary in this film and it would be great to see him in a third installment, but because of his tragic murder by the American government aka avalanche we can only dream.
Sandwiched between the enjoyable original and the underrated third movie, not only is this sequel soulless, abrasive and boring, it's entirely lacking in laughs.
The third scene is the "suspense" scene at the club as the new stripper (ex-penthouse pet Kimberley Kelley) who, you see, isn't actually a stripper at all, but is actually undercover investigating the smothering death of her sister, another stripper (these events presumably took place in Midnight Tease 1, which I haven't seen) snoops around for clues.
Unfortunately, my video store that I rent at does not have the second Beverly Hills Cop or the third, so when I stopped by Best Buy and saw the sequel for $6.99, I thought it might be worth a buy.
I loved Beverly Hills Cop 2, I hope I do find the third one, I know it doesn't have as good of a rating like the first or the second one, but still I love Eddie Murphy.
- ah well, I digress) and this entry explains why there was no third.
And it's much better than the disappointing third movie in the series, "Beverly Hills Cop III".
In the first third of the movie Vitus is six years old and in the rest he is twelve.
This is a great setup for a rich final payoff that is totally squandered in the final third where Vitus starts playing the stock market in order to save his father's job.
My father was killed in a car accident three days before I would have celebrated my third birthday.
Lucrezia was also well portrayed, she was loved by the citizens of Ferrara (home of her third husband) for her charitable works and they requested for her to be canonised but the Pope (unsurprisingly given her 'reputation') declined.
It gets old quick sometimes though, as there's Sean and Alan and then the respective conservative and liberal guests all going off at once yelling at each other like a bunch of third graders.
The button for this can get you third person view, and that is invaluable in this.
This is the third decade since then and life moves on.
It's 1AM on a weekday, and more than a year after watching this movie for the third time, I'm still haunted by it, like an overwhelming memory that won't fade.
In April of 1994, all hell broke loose as extremists assassinated Rwanda's president and staged a coup, pretending a "third force" was at fault.
The first third deals with the mysterious Yor stumbling upon a tribal village.
The third and final installment of the three is "Box", directed by Takashi Miike of ODISHON, and it plays with the unease that characterizes some of David Lynch's own forays into inter-dimensions.
The third story is Takashi Miikes tale simply called "Box".
The third segment, and my favorite, is from my man the amazing Takashi Miike of Ichi the Killer fame.
The third and final film is "Box" by Takashi Miike.
The third and final part is by Takashi Miike (most famous for Audition and Ichi the Killer) his film is called 'Box' this story contains a woman's worst nightmares as they become reality.
Over all I give this film 7 out of 10, manly because of the first two films, they each got you involved with the characters and had a great ending, the third made me drop the score by a couple of marks, if they had 'Dumplings' as there final piece I would have enjoyed this film a lot more, a good thing about the films is the length of them, as some of the times you may not have the time to watch a two hour feature you can choose to just watch one of the stories and turn it off afterwards.
I think Dirty Harry is a super cool character, but this third installment is just the pits.
This is the third Dirty Harry movie and the series begins to lose it's legs.
The third film in the Dirty Harry series is more of a regular action film than a Dirty Harry movie.
****Excellent  ***Good  **Fair  *Poor  This is the third installment in the Dirty Harry franchise and probably should have been the last.
That's one of the Dirty Harry films, one of the first maybe, the third one actually.
Clint Eastwood's third coming as Detective Harry Callahan is once again a stylish, well-made, fast-paced and wonderfully strong police thriller that's definitely worth a watch or ten.
The third picture featuring Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry.
This third film in the series, "The Enforcer" of 1976, is arguably the most action-packed Callahan flick (along with the fifth and last one, "The Dead Pool" of 1988).
When "Magnum Force" tried to becalm critics (who bashed the original for its political incorrectness) a bit by having Harry fight vigilantes, this third film in the series is as politically incorrect as ever.
Clint Eastwood returns to his most famous non-western role of Inspector Harry Callaghan in the third of the San Francisco based crime thrillers.
In this third chapter from the Book of Dirty Harry Callahan, there's plenty of action as Harry breaks in a new partner and goes after a ruthless bunch, some self-proclaimed revolutionaries who are nothing more than common criminals, in `The Enforcer,' directed by James Fargo, and starring Clint Eastwood and Tyne Daly.
What really gives this one that ring of authenticity, however, is that Clint Eastwood is in top form, and even in his third outing as Harry seems more immersed in the character than ever.
The third film (and probably the cheapest, as it looks like it) of the series 'The Enforcer' seemed to have that swinging and carefree vibe of the times, with the biting reality and stark realisations (heavily implemented in the first two) taking a backseat for forceful (if crass) humour.
A lot of dead bodies pile up in this one, including John Mitchum in his third and final appearance in a Dirty Harry film.
This is the third installment of the Dirty Harry series, all starring the legendary four-times Academy Award-winning actor and director Clint Eastwood.
The third person narration by B.A.H.
This one (which I saw under the title HOLIDAY MASSACRE) is his third foray into the horror/thriller genre and basically follows the same exact formula, cramming as much nudity in as possible but seemingly forgetting about everything else.
True individualism and rebellion often are leader-less, and the film seemed to suggest that these impressionable boys either "go with the official program", or "go with Professor Keating's"--no third way, really.
"Screams of a Winter Night" was made with student actors attending Northwestern State University in Natchitoches,Louisiana,a college that has since been abandoned,the neglected campus becoming a popular teen hang-out.It consists three genuinely spooky stories told by a young campers in an old cabin.The first one is about 'The Moss Point Man',a Yeti-like creature encountered by a local girl and her boyfriend deep in the woods.The second one is about a mute psychopath in an allegedly haunted hotel with the climax somewhat reminding me "The Blair Witch Project".The third story is about a sexually repressed girl turning psycho after an attempted rape.The strange,howling wind is becoming stronger and stronger...Creepy low-budget gem from late 70's without gore and nudity.It has some great scares and surprising twists.8 out of 10.
"Escape" boasts a very tough-talking script, with glints of humor coming from the bickerings between (those great character actors) Williams Demarest and Campbell, and its final third is remarkably suspenseful, as Roper, Carla and the escaped rebs are laid siege in a ditch, while the Mescaleros pick them off with rifle shot and lob volleys of arrows into their midst.
This turns dark and perhaps the darkness is implicit in the persona of the tramp and the venue of the circus, but it also has some breathtaking and very funny sequences before that final third.
This third installment finds a great white shark who wreaks havoc at a aquatic Florida amusement park.
For all those people that did not like Jaws 2, this third installment makes the second look as good as the original!
This film falls into the third category.
You get shlocky trash, you get unknown actors, you get dumb cartoon characterizations shot on the cheap for nickels and dimes--canned and sometimes original linear productions, first act second act third act straight action with a hint of sex ( and little more than a hint ).
The only teeth coming at me in the cinema were the ones that a boy in the third row had stolen from his grandfather and thrown.
In the third and last part of the film, firefighters attempt to douse the oil blazes, their hoses and equipment rearing up and out in the smoke and sunshine, shining like monsters in the alien landscape.
The real culprits in the movie are the slow pacing, especially the middle third, and the terrible fight scenes in the "circuit."
>:( I can't wait until the third one comes out.
I am so excited for the third movie.
but a third movie *COULD* be a huge mistake but with Kenny Ortega as the directer there's a small chances for it to be a mistake!!!!!!!!!!!
A third is almost nothing but stock footage of seals,dolphins, and various tribes that look nothing alike in different scenes.
The remaining two third played on a real comedy level and has nothing to do with a thriller.
Although the film's about an FBI agent (Woody Harrelson) tailing Max because he's convinced the crook is going to steal the third "Napoleon Diamond" from a visiting cruise ship, this really isn't a cat-and-mouse picture.
The Seven Seas Navigator is docking in Paradise Island in the Bahamas for a solid weekÂThey're having a nice promotion for the maiden voyage, calling it the Diamond Cruise: a gem exhibit whose star attraction is the third Napoleon DiamondÂ It's, allegedly, the only priceless remaining 'cute little rock' Max Burdett and Lola Cirillo haven't stolenÂ   The unlocking Special Agent Stan Lloyd of the FBI (Woody Harrelson) suspects that the two are planning to purloin itÂ But how could they with six cameras plus 24-hour rotating guards, unbreakable polycarbonate display?
The film starts off promisingly enough, but much like the titular `ÂPlan', this movie falls apart by the third act.
I'm glad I finally found a place to rent a copy rather than buying one, and it's obvious that the rental houses agree with my assessment, as I had to check on Netflix, two Blockbusters, and one Hollywood video before I could find a lone copy at a third Blockbuster.
The third story is the shortest, but is surprisingly well done.
Eleanor Lightbody is old hat to the San (this being her third visit) but Will Lightbody's rookie year is met with confusion, resistance and embarrassment, as he fantasies about the beautiful Nurse Irene Graves (Traci Lind) in the nude and wonders if he should add hallucinations to his list of ailments.
Christopher Guest is a creative spirit who has been able to make some very funny films like 'Best In Show' where his technique of avoiding a script by giving his cast of actors an outline as matrix for a scene, letting them ad lib the idea a couple of times, then accepting the second or third take as the final product - pasting all the bits together in the edit.
"Plata quemada" explores the romance between them ("los mellizos") and third people, and how beyond all the circumstances they know how they love each other without even telling each other.
While for the first 90 minutes it's a film that equates boredom with realism, walking with paranoia and monosyllabic scripting with profundity, for the last couple of reels we get a half-hearted car chase, an impressive car crash (that leads to a moment of utter absurdity as a third viewing of the scene suddenly reveals a previously invisible survivor running across a motorway in plain sight), silly disguises, unarmed combat with a lesbian CIA hitwoman and the obligatory symbolic falling off a building dream scene as it ticks off the genre staples to throw in enough action to put together a decent trailer (certainly a parachute jump and the opening CGi cosmic zoom from the dark side of the Moon to close-up on a ferry with an unfortunately ridiculous sense of scale seem designed more for marketing than narrative purposes).
Since we've watched random story elements from DELIVERANCE, DEATH WISH, and STRAW DOGS we figure that the third act will be bloody retribution.
Two are best friends, the third is Gus' wife.
The eagles are great, but instead of the two mentioned, the last shot shows a third one coming down for his "treat".
It's my totally favorite show, with Rocket Power in close second, and As Told By Ginger in third.
The man of many talents, Red Skelton, has some of his funniest moments on screen in this third and final installment of his amateur radio detective, Wally 'The Fox' Benton, series.
This is the third and funniest of Red Skelton's "Whistling" movies about the murderous misadventures of Wally Benton, actor, who plays most of the roles on radio's mystery show, "The Fox".
The third guy, son of the last one, irony of destiny, doesn't seems at all to his father (and his mother too), because he's thin as a bone...
The second story focuses on a fat speed eating champion who was born with a tail (and could either be the son of the lieutenant or the son of MorosgovÃ¡nyi; which it is not to clearly explained and therefore up to our imagination) and is by far the most boring story out of all three, his character stays undeveloped, we learn little about him, he just eats and pukes, finally he falls in love with a fat woman and together they have a child, so begins the third and last story, as the child grows up to be a skinny and kind of creepy Taxidermist, who lives alone with his now even fatter and bed ridden father and his large mutant cats.
The third story features Half-Piggy, much older and by now weighing around two tons, looking distinctly like a Euro-trash version of Jabba The Hutt.
The third isn't special in any ways, but wants to be.
This is the third game that THQ came out with and it is pretty sweet.
(A bit with the Mary-Pickford type got cut, but you can still see some of her as the third town girl in the opening scenes.)
This is a film about women from third world countries hoping to get a better life by marrying to a developed country.
And the unexpected onslaught of racial stereotyping in the middle third is just one example of the throwing-sh*t-against-the-wall distractions and gadgeteering that clutter things up.
The third cut scene explains Sally's meeting with Duo and Trowa on the shuttle, and the fourth is a surprisingly good scene with Dorothy.
This tangent, which takes full form in the third act, for the most part surpasses the drudgery that comes beforehand, and establishes a touching, if slightly overly done sentimental climax.
Move right to the third movie.
Given that the ending is one of the technical worst that can happen, leading straight to the third installment, let's hope that the concluding chapter really does see the light of day.
And trust me the third one is going to be bad the first one was not bad, the third one was bad and I truly hope the next one isn't worse than this one.
This film was really good, but not as good as the first in my opinion, can't wait for the third one to come out!
Maybe he's got an important part in the third movie...
It'll be interesting to see the third film at the World Cup, but my expectations are not that high.
So far an improvement over "Daughter of Dracula", this third installment of Universal's "Dracula" series is a very worthy successor to the 1931 masterpiece.
Fox is doing a great job in the lead, just like he always does.It was while filming this movie when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's.He was only thirty and one year earlier he was still playing a teenager in a movie.That movie was the third part of Back to the Future, where Mike was of course Marty McFly.Now he's doing much less acting, but still he is doing something.Recently I saw him in two parts of Scrubs, where he played Dr. Kevin Casey.He is great playing doctors and whatever.
I've got to admit first off that I much prefer Universal's Frankenstein series to the Dracula one (same goes for Hammer Horror), but this third showing for the count isn't bad at all.
As you can see in my profile i'm from Belgium so i saw the original version of this movie ( and it rules by the way :-) ) but when i heard that there was going to be remake done of this movie i thought "well maybe it wont be as bad as every other remake" ( cause American remakes of movies are always less then the original ( no offense ) examples: The Grudge, The Ring ) but again i was wrong, choosing girls in bikini's as the bad guys(girls) was a bad mistake same as choosing Queen Latifah as the cab driver and the way that the story is brought on to screen is also really bad, i also thought that a good point would be the car itself cause in the third original TAXI ( TAXI 3 ) the story wasn't that good but the car was one of the plus points, but that doesn't apply to this movie, so i'll give you one last advice : don't go and see this movie but try to get a hand on the original TAXI by Luc Besson and i'll assure you you'll have a great time  greetings from A.V.
I'm not kidding when I say that this a remake of the three French films since although the film is mainly a poor remake of the the first film, it lifts sequences from the second and third films.
Like the son of another famous Universal monster, this third entry in the series (not counting the 1931 Spanish Dracula) is a solid film all round: marvelous atmosphere, gripping narrative, superb handling.
Do you feel the labored edit of your story is justified by the power of the third act and the direction of the characters arc?
third, many scenes were superfluous and unrealistic.
This was a third in the line of Dracula films for Universal.
Don't get me wrong; "Little Britain" was still good through the second and third series, and characters like the travel agent and Vicky Pollard were brilliant.
East of Eden doesn't make it since Kazan used less than a third of a towering novel.
Little Britain Series 1 was great, Series 2 was also great, but the usual comedy formula that third series screw the whole thing up (as it did to "The Fast Show") works on Little Britain, and we were let down by a rather disappointing Series 3 last year.
However, the third series will never be as loved by all as either of the others, but was better than The Fast Show's Series 3 by a long shot.
It is a bit dated and 'stagey' in its opening minutes, partly because it is taken from the play, not the novel, by John Steinbeck, and also because so many of the outstanding cast were only making their second or third film, and needed warming up and getting used to the camera.
A much better third film, King of Thieves followed.
2/10  PS Disney to an extent redeems itself with a third movie in the series, but it can't begin to account for the damage of this monstrosity.
I liked this movie; it was fun and exciting, and don't forget: that short, fat bad guy was caught in the tree, wondering why he didn't get his third wish!!!!!
Agrabah is safe once again, with Abis Mal hanging on a tree after the end credits, saying, "Does this mean I don't get my third wish?"
But soon, more bodies turn up, and Smecker learns that Conner and Murphy (and a third, David Della Rocco) may be the ones behind the mayhem on the streets.
The social commentary should probably be looked at as more of a plot device than intelligent thought, but I found myself watching this movie repeatedly and enjoying it more the second and third time around.
With an interesting third act with Bronson Pinchot (Cousin Balki from "Perfect Strangers", or "The Langoliers")... you must see this film.
Now it's the Gorillas against Bugs on first, Bugs on second, Bugs on third, Bugs pitching, Bugs catching; and it's no match.
This third installment of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan series is an exciting adventure of intrigue.
That saying is the theme at the heart of Clear And Present Danger, the third film in the Jack Ryan film series.
The third installment in the cinematic series based on Tom Clancy's CIA analyst Jack Ryan, CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is a long but engrossing political action thriller that once again puts Harrison Ford, the thinking man's action film actor, in the role of Ryan.
CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER is the third adaptation of yet another Tom Clancy bestseller, spawned by the success of the previous Clancy adaptations THE HUNT FOR RED October and PATRIOT GAMES.
But, to be honest, the first two films were full of such despair and angst, it was refreshing to see the third film a bit more cheerful and playful.
But the third one....how to say, I think they can stop making the series.
Having really loved the first two films I was really looking forward to the third part.
I have not seen the third yet but I will soon!!
Keep up the good work Hideo Nakata...I can't wait to see the third movie.
That said, alongside a thrilling third act, Nakata does offer the audience a host of truly disturbing images, such as a melted, burnt-to-a-crisp videotape in a bathtub, Sadako's reconstructed facial features, and again, the distorted photos of those unlucky enough to have been "marked" by Sadako.
But Nakata and co. might like to try a little harder if they decide to make a third (or fourth?)
Truly a masterpiece which inspired me to submit a sort of comical comic strip parody to a Ring 0 art contest last year, where I won third place, which was pretty exciting.
One is a nurse, the second a girl scout, and the third his Phantom Brother.
For a start he talks about a lot of Americans right off the bat when he discusses obesity, as a third of Americans are classified as medically obese and about half of those as morbidly obese, according to the latest American Medical Association studies.
The third thing is that at times he is so into giving a lyrical, sometimes even poetic kind of rhythm to his bits and terms in his linguist way (the first five minutes of the special a great warm-up, is a keeper) that might throw people off.
A STUDY IN SCARLET was Florey's third project at Tiffany, and he was again scheduled to both write and direct--his preferred mode of working.
when by chance I saw an episode I now recognize as a third season one; I was puzzled then since I realized I was missing something from the life's stories of these intriguing characters: it was like intruding in someone else's life, more than a pi standard TV-movie... That's it: I believe you're hooked by the believable interaction of the main characters, their likes and dislikes; some episodes are quite 'poor' and unbelievable, but never awful; other episodes are more complex and well shot; but almost always you'll have some fun with them; and finally Magnum's off screen voice is capturing your attention, and make you another close friend worth of his confidence... After so many years, one day I just missed that feeling and I discovered the two first seasons were published on DVD, so now, after watching them, I feel reassured of not being a 'stranger' in Magnum's world anymore....
She's heavily pregnant and when complications arise from her pregnancy, we can't help but wonder if the third child will be like Thomas or Charlie.
The Darjeeling Limited is actually a run-down train, the kind you would find in just about any third world landscape.
The brothers jump into the river, save two of the children but are unable to save a third.
After having watched this movie Dracula III i thought that they should have kept Stephen Billington as the one and only Dracula in the third movie because he gave it that, how do you say?, mystery and yet at the same time he keeps you on the edge of your seat, your heart rate fast and makes you anticipate his beautifully exotic voice.
The second movie was about humans discovering the concept of vampirism and the third was about vampires on lose in Romania.
Dracula: Legacy is the third and final installment to Dracula series.
On the third day of his honeymoon, he meets a (rich) spoiled college kid, Kelly (Cybill Shepherd), whose beauty and laugh captivate him.
sorry, but i recommend to see forgetting Sarah Marshall a second or even a third time instead.
Certainly one of the most original and offbeat horror films to come out in a long time, this one almost demands a second viewing just to appreciate the imaginative production design, and a third just to catch all the throwaway gags (a sign reads "Road To Nowhere" and, in smaller letters, "Don't Buckle Up.
some comments were that it started a little slow but after a third of the movie you got hooked and it only got better!
This has been the third best cast I have heard in a game after Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Father and The Curse of Monkey Island, two of the greatest games ever made.
The entire set up sequence which runs for a third of the film has more gags and is more fun than the latter two thirds set at the training camp.
Mitchum was the third candidate for the role at Warner Brothers for the role of Jeb Rand.
In the third series, the crew are joined by an android, Kryten, who has a manic obsession with cleaning and helping, which leads to yet more hilarious consequences.
I was disappointed by the opening episode, so like the Smeghead that I am did not bother with the show again until it reached its third season.
Despite third billing, Belle Bennett stars as Stella and is very good in the role of her career.
It tends to go a little flat at the end of the middle act and the start of the third act but effects, gore and very tense action compensate for those not too engrossed in the intricacies of the story.
Then I remembered my history of Mexico ("Mexico" by Michael D. Coe, third edition, p. 146):   "Into this uneasy political situation stepped the last barbaric tribe to arrive in the Valley of Mexico, the Aztecs, the 'people whose face nobody knows'.
)Âwhile the explosive ending was replicated wholesale into the official third JAWS entry (THE LAST SHARK was actually released as part of the series in Spain!).
The plot reminds of certain films by AlmodovÃ r, but unfortunately Julio Medem is not AlmodovÃ r.  The sex disappears after one third of the story.
Judging solely by IMDb's votes, it's Kurosawa's third least seen movie.
The movie is OK up until the last third which is just a redundant and long-winded exposition of the first 2/3 of the movie.

In this third tale the scenery is so beautiful and impressive that it is almost beyond comprehension.
Since they are completely unrelated, except for that, the decision to untangle them was a wise one, and the version I saw, with a prologue flashing forward to the middle of the third segment, makes the three complicated plot lines about as clear as they could be.
The life of the shanty-dwellers in the third segment is particularly grim.
This film shows very different cases and reactions by people from the first world and third world, facing an unjust world and trying to do their best to get by.
Being the third largest religion in this world we deserve some respect for our beliefs, we aren't as aggressive as Muslims to blow bombs on this topic, but at least one could have researched on thi topic before making a movie.
and costumes, an outstanding and Oscar-winning Erich Wolfgang Korngold score (he virtually composed all of Flynn's swashbucklers and some of the best Warner Bros. films from this period), expansive sets (Hollywood credibly standing in for 12th century England - Carl Jules Weyl's art direction receiving another Oscar, with a third going to Ralph Dawson's exciting editing).
Still, the IMDb listings appear to be incomplete, as at least the first two among those I would like to watch are omitted: THE BANDIT OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1946), ROGUES OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1950; Alan Hale's third and last stab at the character of Little John, following those of the 1922 and 1938 classics!
this is the episode in which lois and clark finally married it is the third episode of series 4   so to summarize it is the best superman show Ever !
This film is what On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have been like had it been filmed as a comedy, set in Canada, and given a third of the budget.
During your (third person perspective) adventure, you will encounter 3d fighting sections, 1st person shooting areas, and concerts by David Bowie himself in seedy nightclubs!
However, what lacks in this meticulously carved anti-war flick is the actualities of war, and the director purposefully neglected it in sole order to provide the third opinion on the war- companionship between enemies against the dichotomy of winner/sinner and/or victory/defeat.
Why the robbers would come back to the scene of the crime a third time to commit yet the same crime in the same manner is beyond, I would think, the reach of most of the world's dumbest criminals, and these guys weren't that dumb.
I hope there will be a third installment here, making this a trilogy.
This third sequel, "Phantasm IV: Oblivion", however, has hardly any positive aspects.
My third viewing of this masterpiece some time ago revealed to me just how brilliant it really is.
I've found a new perennial favorite, one that is perfect for every third Thursday in March.
It's only third worst.
And perhaps a third: the Artisan DVD indicates Queens Logic was filmed in 1:33.
I consider Phantasm IV to be a little better than the disappointing (but still good) third entry of the series, but my issue with this one is that even though you are entertained throughout and your eyes will probably be glued to the screen, nothing really happens when you think about it.
Wow...  Continuity errors are what really disappointed me about the third movie, but aside from The Tall Man's need for Mike to be alive carried over from the third, one this one luckily has none.
Argiris Bakirtzis, the standard protagonist of the directors latest and best films, functions here as a balance factor, that only displays any personality "between the lines" covering the final third of the national character pool.

That may have been the only thing to do in third world countries.
Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone), a trained killer, spends a third of his journey using violence to learn the truth of his brother's death.
Even the third act, in which many movies, even good ones, fall completely to pieces, is solid here.
The Black Lodger was Hitchcock's third movie, and his first masterpiece, as I understand.
The Lodger is Arthur Hitchcock's third feature-length directorial effort, and a landmark film for him.
The Lodger was the feature which Hitchcock himself described as his first true film (it was actually his third complete one), and film historians, particularly auteurists tend to focus upon it because it is it introduces themes of murder and suspense that Hitch's name would later be synonymous with.
Sir Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) became a director of note with this silent film, his first thriller and only his third directorial effort, which shows the young Master's talents being developed in embryo.

The third - director Monte Hellman ("Two-lane Blacktop" and "The Terror") - struggles to be the "classy" story about a young screen-writer who falls in love with his best friend's chick who turns out to be a blood drinker... Boring and senseless!
Leo (the great John Saxon) gets to tell the third story, of him and his friend, Stanley.
- Stanley's Girlfriend: The third tale, this one about the peril of deceit, is the 'classiest' of the bunch, utilizing mood & suspense more than outward horror.
This was my third time viewing the film - the first as an extra on Image's DVD of the Silent version of THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927) and the second on TCM, as part of a Harold Lloyd marathon in anticipation of the release of this same 7-Disc collection, when I was in Hollywood late last year; actually, I liked it better this time around, hence I upped the rating from **1/2 (besides, back then, I wasn't as familiar with the star's short films as I am now)!
The tentacles on the sprinkler impale one kid's chest, rip the shin off the second kid and tear open the head of the third kid.
Take the first, second, and third seasons of Family Guy, which are well-scripted and still very funny.
The first of the three was really good and really dark and dramatic, the second one was just as good but seemed more like a comedy than a drama, and the third one was just plain weird.
First scene is a rip-off of Johnny English, the third scene is copied from one of Mr.Bean's episodes.
Some may have only seen the third (poor) movie and the TV series (good 1st season) which wouldn't really help you here.
I would love to see Bryan Singer back in the director's chair and ignore the third film and do it the way he wants and the fans want.
all i gotta say for this movie is that it blows, pointless story line,crappy cast, no laughs, waste of my time and the TV stations, the best part of this movie was the mud wrestling all though it lasted some 5 seconds i love meghan in this movie and i think she was the only bright spot but ya this movie blows i give it a third of a star(only cuz they mud wrestled) out of 5, plz don't watch this movie even if it is the only thing on TV i personally would go to sleep but eh its the best option considering this movie will put u to sleep wut a waste to the national lampoon series damn id rather watch van wilder again at least it had some laughs, o well this is wut the movie world has come to
I only got 2 watch the third one, but it was still really good!I really want everything i can find that is about InuYasha: movies, season DVD sets, toys, collectibles, and anything else i can find that's about InuYasha.I want 2 see the other movies really bad.
i herd that the 2nd 1 was the best, but according, 2 IMDb's reviews, the third one was the best.

As it is, it comes in a distant third, behind the sweeping vistas and the music.
The third thing that I thought very amateurish and ridiculous was the so called real time walk along St. Petersburg streets.
Before Mike Myers began completely embarrassing himself with the third instalment of Austin Powers, he played many a great character.
Possibly part inspired by the sad and tragic case of little Kathy Fiscus, who in 1949 fell down a San Marino well, Rouse's picture shifts to an equally, and engrossing gear for its final third.
In a stunning opening, she is murdered, and then just as quickly, her murderer is murdered by an unseen third party.
This is Bavaâs third âbody countâ movie after BLOOD AND BLACK LACE (1964) and FIVE DOLLS FOR AN AUGUST MOON (1970); however, given that teenagers are also involved here, this is the one which became the virtual template for all the teen slashers which stormed Hollywood in the late 1970s/early 1980s.
Then he himself is butchered by a mysterious third person.
Kane Hodder (in his third appearance as Jason) also gets a credit for stunts.
"DÃ©calage horaire" (2002) aka "Jet Lag" was the third film written/directed by Daniele Thompson that I've seen.
Thompson returned to the multi-character format in her third (and so far last)writer-director stint, the brilliant Fauteuils d'Orchestre but in between, as if to prove her versatility, she came up with this, essentially two-hander which exploits brilliantly the talents of Juliette Binoche and Jean Reno.
By coincidence, these two people meet, and the third story begins.
One has a sledgehammer, the second has a pick ax, the third is equipped with a large chain, and the fourth is equipped with a jackhammer.
*Spoiler Alert*   While one of the ghouls yanks the person off their feet with the chain, the second and third then proceed to stab and smash with their sledgehammer and pick ax.
The third immediate attraction for me is that Route 666 is set in a Joshua Tree-filled desert.
The first has a clever climax; while the second deals with complex issues in a sombre way, leaving the third to close this dynamic in its own unique fashion.
The third, "Mother and Son 1907," is about a pretentious painter who comes up with elaborate philosophies about his love life.
Way too slow introducing things, and the inept caucasians and uncaring African-Americans just aren't amusing after the third or fourth wacky misunderstanding.
While it gets over-dramatically silly, it is SPOT ON about the capability of Californian behavior (and I say that as a third generation Southern Californian who was raised, in part, by a German/Mexican stepmother).
Still a great pleasure to watch even for the third time.
The special effects are third rate.
During the last third of 'Papillon', not including the final act, Schaffner veers slightly away from the touching human friendship story and descends into above-average adventure mode, which was interesting but not on par with the rest of the film.
The third time I saw this movie I thought it was the most ingenious comedy I had ever seen.
So when Clive Turner decided to do a third Howling sequel he decided to make it closer to the novel which was fine.

She tells him she's a model and an actress--her third time on TV is in front of the elevator security camera!
The production value (costumes, art direction) alone is a good third of the laughs.
I watched it the first time and giggle a bit, I watched it the second time and laughed here and there, I watched it for the third time and laughed nearly all the way through!
And in 1969, Aldrich handed the directing reins (producing only this time) to Lee H. Katzin, for what may be viewed as the third in a loose trilogy of films dealing with geriatric battleaxes (or aging gargoyles, as my buddy Rob prefers to call them) having at each other with no quarter given.
Unfortunately, the film loses focus in the last third where a convoluted "murder" disrupts proceedings.
The third sees a pre-Tom Hanks Big really get to the heart of the matter.
I liked the third story best.
Vincente Minnelli did the second story, Gottfried Reinhardt directed the first and third.

The third, with Pier Angeli and Kirk Douglas was a treat even for a viewer who does not usually like Kirk Douglas.
This film is actually the third entry in the Sorority House Massacre series, but stands just fine on its own (I've never seen the two preceding SHMs).
Yet a third plot has blacksploitation greats Richard Roundtree and Fred Williamson as ex-cops who go to Vegas for the hell of it and run afoul of, yup you guessed it.
But he is leaving at the start of the third day for Carpathia with his mother and son, and has another 18 months of duty before he is free.
During the first third of the action, Gibson acquaints us with a small village of hunters isolated in a distant corner of the rain forest.
During the second third of the action, Gibson stages the incredible journey of hardship on foot that the villainous warriors and their captives take through the steaming jungle, across swollen rivers, and along sheer cliff sides to a faraway metropolitan Mayan city.
Seasoned moviegoers will spot how the last third of the action resembles the Cornel Wilde movie "The Naked Prey" (1966), the Jean Claude Van Damme thriller "Hard Target" (1993) and the classic "The Most Dangerous Game" (1932) where an outnumbered hero must triumph over tenacious thugs.
In the Beowulf, Grendel's mother is killed by the hero, the cup appears only in the third act and the dragon has no relationship with Grendel's mother.
It deals with complex social issues; those of overpopulation (which generally means first world values foisted on third world countries), incarceration in prisons run by private companies (a concept currently being adopted world-wide), and the love of a man for his wife and child.
The third act of the film is nearly all action, as the Thief braves many perils including monsters and fiery caverns to win the ultimate prize for the princess.
When "Bordello of Blood" flopped at the box office, the third film never happened sadly.
And a third point deducted for the nudity.
The third remains the more ambiguous, and maybe more uncomfortable, segment of the bunch, and even if it might be the lesser of them all it's still fascinating due to the actors.
Wile the opening third is laboriously slow and drawn out, the story fortunately picks up steam and really starts cooking when the boat passengers reach the island: The island location projects a profoundly unsettling feeling of isolation and vulnerability, the cannibal's filthy corpse-strewn underground lair is a truly scary place, and, of course, the moments of intense hardcore splatter deliver the disgusting goods (stomach-churning highlights include a meat cleaver to the face, a severed head in a bucket, a couple of torn out jugular veins gushing blood, the infamous fetus eating scene, and the gloriously gruesome climax with the cannibal munching on his own intestines).
i think they should continue on and make a third season!
Although Popular only aired for two seasons, the reason the season two finale was a cliffhanger, was because there was originally going to be a third season, but the show was suddenly canceled, with no time to re-write the ending into a more satisfactory explanation.
This is not a film to watch hungry as the last third of the film is devoted to a delectable feast.
His purpose, of course, was to get the army to court martial him and use this as a forum to sue for recognition and the formation of a third armed force.
Once you acquire the lightsabre about a third of the way through the game you begin to increase your force powers and the game, unfortunately, becomes laughably easy.
The latter group is, for example, the first two Prince of Persia games, and both this and the third game(where the focus still laid largely laid in the second of the two categories) of that series attempt for a mix... in the case of both, the result is that you can hack and slash away effortlessly and, more by chance than anything else, take out boss enemies and other players.
The acting was very poor, leading one to believe that perhaps the creator's friends were used in production, rather than Ms. Simmon's third grade class, but the difference is negligible.
I do remember that perhaps a third of the class was asleep throughout most of the `films' duration.
And then the ending third of the movie seemed like an after thought and totally useless, like the filmmakers suddenly realized they haven't bored us enough and needed some more useless, unimaginative, uninteresting, drab filler.
The third strand exists in the present day.
Jet Li in his third US movie again plays credible and hard and does not compromise his great ability in the martial arts by use of embarrassing buffoonery as Jackie Chan has chosen to do(particularly in RUSH HOUR and its sequel).Li engages in a long series of well choreographed fight scenes against a variety of foes including a lone fight against a gymful of karate students(another nod to THE MAN FROM HONG KONG)and faces a particularly nasty villain in the form of the excellent Tcheky Karyo who is on peak form here.
The third airman, Henry Crocker (Grant), washes out and later becomes an aerial gunner.
This year the dull, boring and fake person who played dumb won the show for at a least a third consecutive time.

Michael Davis' third straight film with the same basic premise, is the worst of the three.
Unfortunately, he's downed in the wilderness with and injured man and a third uncooperative officer.

This was the third Larraz title I've watched after VAMPYRES (1974) and THE COMING OF SIN (1978) Â and will be promptly followed by another, THE HOUSE THAT VANISHED aka SCREAMÂAND DIE!

However, the movie makes a pretty amazing turn in the final third.
At times, Williams is playing the second or even third banana by the end of the movie.
I attended the first day of shooting on location, but did not go for the second day - they came to get me, I suppose because they liked what they saw in the "dailies" - There was a third day of shooting, all of which were totally miserable for me - I had no aspirations to be a "movie-star" - I was an established drag-act with a large following and loved my work.

This third entry is not really as good as the two other films, but well worth seeing.
After waiting for about 5 years for a third movie after seeing parts one and two, I was kind of disappointed that I would probably not see another one, but after a 13 year wait, I finally got my wish.
View this third offering with an open mind and you will enjoy it without comparison to the first two.
The film spends the first third fleshing out everyone but the centerpiece and then doesn't give him any depth as he stumbles through his thick cockney mumblings from one costar to the next.
In this third installment of the `Dundee' series, once again starring Paul Hogan as the famed and fearless crocodile hunter, Mick Dundee, we find Mick, his significant other, Sue Charleton (Linda Kozlowski) and their fourth-grade son, Mikey (Serge Cockburn) living in a small hamlet (population 20) in Australia on the cusp of the Outback.
Fans of the movie should also view the inferior, but still funny See No Evil, Hear No Evil which sees the partnership of Wilder and Pryor re-ignited for a third time, following on from Stir Crazy and Silver Streak before that.
It makes for a fine final third and given that the film isn't much more than 70 minutes long anyway, things have barely moments in which to slip out of interest.
Crawford is amusing as a lovable lug, and Brophy fits in well as the third member of this motley crew.
This is the third German offering that I've found to be quite enjoyable.
The second and third horror stories were more of comedies and the movie got less horrific after the initial 20 minutes.
All cinema forms, have sought to understand the human condition through the lens of the camera (the third eye?

The third graders Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny all go to see the new Terrence & Philip movie, based on the show's fictional hit Canadian TV show about two farting roommates, mirroring the experience of the likely underaged crowd going to see the "South Park" movie, and there you have the brilliance of "South Park" and this film.
The film begins with the BBC (Frank Thornton) telling us through the facade of an old television that this is the third, or is it the fourth?, anniversary of the shortest war in history, lasting 2 hours and 28 minutes.
As I watched a second and third time I began to notice hidden things within the film, which must have been placed within the film on purpose, and I did not notice them the first time I watched.
From Rance's nutty first entrance to the hilarious concluding plot twist, Serling managed to crank out his best comedy while buried under the stress of his third full season of production.
This film can be enjoyed on so many levels and I really enjoyed the third act.
I truly loved Brittany and Jonathan's performances since they are much more younger and less experienced than the actors in the third segment.

By the third viewing, I noticed it was too long, some scenes were boring and pointless and I"m sick of the male lead being 30 years older than the female lead.
(It was also nice to see director Harold Ramis - the third Ghostbuster, after all - in front of the camera again, if only briefly, in a small part as a doctor.)

This was her second movie with Gary Cooper since her appearance in William A. Wellman's superb, high adventure 'Beau Geste,' and her third with director Hathaway...  Richard Widmark proceeds his ways of gambling with a neat line in cynical cracks; Cameron Mitchell fails in his unwelcome sexual advances; Hugh Marlowe uses a variety of both conscious and unconscious processes to deal with his angry feelings; Victor Manuel Mendoza gets intensely angry after being hit; and Rita Moreno delights the environment with her sweet voice...  Hathaway was one of the great Hollywood veterans still in harness, a versatile director whose Westerns have been as variable in quality as his other films... Filmed on location in Mexico, his 'Garden of Evil' is a beautiful spectacle to behold...
The assured hand of master filmmaker George Stevens makes the third and final pairing of Cary Grant and Irene Dunne more than an emotionally satisfying experience.
The third time I watched this film I understood the clear severity of discrimination and hatred that is deflected onto various individuals in American "society".
I am disappointed that the third place finisher got eliminated though...

The third and (to date) last film version of the Edna Ferber/Jerome Kern/Oscar Hammerstein II musical.
Wayne gets third billing in this movie to Marlene Dietrich and Randolph Scott.
When Michael Bates died, the role of the "third man" went to ex military man Foggy Dewhurst (Brian Wilde).
Wilde played the role for ten years, then he left, so next "third man", Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), a mad inventor.
Who was to be the next "third man".
Who is my favourite third man.

Now had I have not watched the third disc, I would have thought that Bruce was singing from off-stage.
Sylvia Chang, wonderful and enarmoured with supposed Singlish, plays a single mother (Jen) struggling with the uncertainty surrounding the sexual orientation of her third son, Leo (played by a certain delectable newcomer, Tan LePham), when his two elder siblings are both out and proud, much to her dismay, bringing issues of same-sex marriage and their boy-friends back to dinner table discussion.
Despite all the bad reviews this is the third best movie I have ever seen!

The film then proceeds very elegantly for about the first third of its running time.
There is a superb scene at jusr about the end of the first third, where Eleni,the film's principal character, wants to leave and walks down to the water.
Then there is the final third of the film which takes us to WW2, but the style is quite abstract and elliptical, and where it is very difficult to pinpoint time.
Set (and beautifully observed) deep into the tour of one of those third tier "acting" companies (heavy on the melodramatic programming and light on competent management) that lived on "the road" and which helped bring about first the rise of powerful central booking agencies and ultimately the formation of Actors' Equity, the film seems to say these are a memory of the past even in 1926 .
Moreover, the basic plot blatantly emulates the second "A Nightmare on Elm Street" movie, the pace really kicks into gear and rarely lets up after the rather leisurely opening third, the 80's clothes and hairstyles are hilariously hideous (Michael's silly blue pajamas are especially sidesplitting!
I would hope it doesn't come back for a third year at the 2007 festival.

The third & last segment was great, with a very sexy Sharon Stone and a wonderful funny Ellen DeGeneres.
As for my "Catching Up With Dolph" initiative I started last week, THE MECHANIK was my third pick.
The first segment was almost unbearably sad; the second had you willing the central figure to defy the attitudes of her equally lesbian friends and keep dating the woman who was expressing her individuality a different way, which was anathema to the others because it had "male" characteristics; the third portrayed a loving partnership's efforts to get one of them pregnant, and their joy when they finally managed it, extremely well.
Everything about this film is embarrassing, from the sanctimonious and passÃ© treatment of lesbians as victims to the terrifyingly awful third installment where Sharon Stone and Ellen DeGeneres offer an achingly sentimental tale of sperm banks in a style that only be described as thirtysomething on prozac or ecstasy.
The third and final part is my favourite.
The third and final movie, features a current day lesbian couple who are trying to have a child.
Finally, a comment must be made about the fact that Anne Heche made her HBO directing debut with the third episode.
Anne Heche appeared (as actress) in the third story of "If These Walls Could Talk", and here directs and writes the third story of "ITWCT 2".
My third complaint is the fact that this is a bit like an anime cartoon.
History and lineage, albeit par for the course in pleasing the "geeks" with Star Wars, is also paid good attention to, creating some cool new characters (a dastard apprentice of the Sith as one of Anakin's fiercest foes also makes a mark of character development), and some recognizable ones (General Grievous's story is a little amusing and also even more dangerous than seen in the third film).
Still, I think the captivating final third more than makes up for it.
Another (an actor) was very impressed by that fact that this very mature film was only the director's third movie and she was amazed by Damian Lewis's bravery in taking on such a complex role with such fearless, selfless dedication.
Story   The "Swords of an Honorable Ruler" referred to in the title are swords that once belonged toInuyasha's father - the Tetsuiga of Earth (wielded by none other than our hero), the Tensaiga of Heaven (wielded by Inuyasha's full demon older bro Sesshomaru), and a third one - Sounga of Hell, a sword so powerful that it can cause great destruction and open the door to the Netherworld.
Comments  This third "Inuyasha" movie is perhaps the best one I've seen so far.
No, we are finally given a story that reveals just what is special of the swords Inuyasha and Sesshomaru possess and a third sword which belonged to the siblings father that is the trouble in the story..
My guess is that if you're curious about seeing the third Inuyasha film then you are already an Inuyasha fan, so I'll write this for all you "otakus" out there!
Although Tenka Hadou no Ken is the third Inuyasha feature film, it's the first of them to actually have the scope of a full-length feature.

I'm straining to dredge up a third star.
Kirsten didn't come back to do the voice for MJ in the third game.
Unlike the second game, where the pedestrians talk with Spidey and comment him while you're swinging around the city, the third game is completely dead in this area.
For the third time in his career Jack Cassidy starred in a Columbo movie.
Moreover, the basic plot blatantly emulates the second "A Nightmare on Elm Street" movie, the pace really kicks into gear and rarely lets up after the rather leisurely opening third, the 80's clothes and hairstyles are hilariously hideous (Michael's silly blue pajamas are especially sidesplitting!
Maybe he's looking for a third option, one that actually does children good, rather than oppressing them or leaving them to run wild in an irresponsible world.

Ms. Ross was the second (or third since Cicely Tyson was also nominated that year for Sounder) African-American to be nominated an Oscar for Best Actress after Dorothy Dandridge's previous nod some 18 years before.
McKay was Billie's second or possibly third husband.
The crusading tone of the last third is a tad heavy, but the ending - both ritually stylised and yet realistically performed - makes its point far better than the courtroom speeches.
Earlier in the film, the Hidalgo men(Plutarco and Cenaro, played by Gerardo Taracena) perform as a guitar and violin combo to disinterested locals who ignore the third Hidalgo, Don Plutarco's grandson, in his approachment for spare change.

Hot Bubblegum is the third entry in the Isreali Lemon Popsicle series.There are nine films in the entire series.I have seen the first three because they are on youtube.Part of the fourth film is on youtube and the whole film should be up soon.Anyway Hot Bubblegum is not as good as Lemon Popsicle 1 or 2(which was the best one), but it is still a funny 1980's teen sex comedy with a good mix of drama and romance in it.My only problem with this film is Bobby and Benji are always friends even after the events of the first and second film.In those, they always fight and never become friends again, yet in the next sequel, they are best friends as if nothing has happened.Also Nicki from the first film(played by a different actress) returns.Benji and her date and talk as if none of the events of the first film happened.Also in the first film, she seemed like a nice girl, yet in this one she's a b**ch!
I think that the third entry of "Eis am Stiel" is JUST COOL !
There was suppose to be a season 3 where it would deal with newer characters such as Ferro lad's twin brother would appear, An older Superman, new legionaries such as Blok, Dawnstar, Wildfire, Shadowlass etc, would have active roles in the third season of the show.
Tonally the film (purposefully) wanders wildly from darkness to light; the acts are very clearly defined; first the Kingdom is established and flourishes; which leads to betray and the emergence of evil in the second, then in a blistering third act there is a muted sense of forgiveness and resolution.
The first act is very entertaining and full of familiar stories (the Sword in the Stone & the Knights of the Round Table) the second act where Lancelot and Guinevere get their rocks off is all about the melodrama and the third act is a searing blend of startling imagery, fierce battles, sorcery and redemption that really does mark out Excalibur as an extraordinary piece of cinema.
You get this series, the first and third series if you can get ahold of them, a lot of movies (Though I only like a few), 2 manga series (One hasn't completely been out yet though, and there are others that haven't been released in English) as well as Lupin the first stuff (Novels from Maurice LeBlanc that Lupin III is based on, as well as movies based off those books, most being hard to get ahold of though), some people don't make their Lupin stuff very Lupin-ish though, so even if you don't really like what Lupin is, there still is probably something with the Lupin name you'll like.
On my first viewing, I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie but I liked it a lot more on the second and by the third - when it's magnificently transferred on DVD - I was fan, too.
Her tough, no nonsense approach to the character, while making her somewhat vulnerable, was very impressive and it's only in the third season that she lost her touch.
The two first seasons were terrific, the third one was solid but the fourth was not good.
Unfortunately Bahksi did exactly half of the story, so when the return of the king continues with the last, third part, some of the most important pieces of the story are missing.
It was the third film from that director I saw, and I felt that he was trying to play it straight, make a prestige picture, denying the insanity of classics such as Written on the Wind.

Another one that falls flat is the third skit in which a man keeps trying to bring his wife to orgasm.
Well, since I watched this movie for the third time, I must like this rubbish, no?
New Jersey State just didn't go for it a third time as 20 years had gone.
The actors (with the exception of Robert Patrick, who is fortunate that few people will see him in this nightmare of a movie) could be out-acted by third graders doing a play about vegetables.
After the third time, it really became tiresome.
Its like a third world Mad Max meets a cheap Mexican version of star wars.
After an hour, it was like pulling teeth for me to finish the last third of the movie.
i didn't have the greatest expectations for this but at least expected it to be as good as the third movie and i was terribly disappointed.
Pointless, juvenile, absolutely worthless(..unless you just have an urge to see stars from the original returning to reprise their roles)sequel to the original Sleepaway Camp(..the second and third films featuring Pamela Springsteen in the "prominant" role of Angela are completely disregarded, which is probably a good thing, I guess)has a psycho-killer, in black hoody, targeting those who victimize and mistreat extremely repellent frog-devoted Allan(Michael Gibney), always the center of negative attention in regards to practically everyone, in constant disagreements, arguments, and skirmishes with the teenagers/adults in camp.
I liked both the more straight-forward, gritty slasher feel of the original film, as well as the comic splatter of the second and third films.
In the second and third, we had Molly and Marcia as heroines, and they were both nice gals.
The plot often seems to come second or third.
Diane Keaton ( I honestly can't believe she got a Golden Globe award for her performance) acts as if there is always a third party in the room.
The first two movies were cute, the third was...blech, but when a movie stars Hulk Hogan.... slow up on that, you've already lost all the money that you put into this flop; and then some.
I'm watching the DVDs of DEADWOOD third season and it seems that somewhere near the middle or the end of season two, Milch's writing became infected with writing disease.

Perhaps a third party, an FBI agent or even his wife, could voice suspicions.
Through the first third or so Kid Breslin wasn't really funny much at all.
For the final third of the movie when he's back he's much better, funnier and it is a delight to watch him.
Whether the last third of the film explains his reasons for being there or not, the film should've focused much more on what she needs, what she is experiencing and should've explained a lot more of her backstory of who she is as an Aussie geologist, rather than let them both be strangely stranded "tourists" who are seeking for some sort of direction from the plot!!!
Tsunashima did his best to behave like the Japanese caricature that the filmmaker wanted, and of course same goes for the wife and the whole setup in the last third of the film.
I have absolutely no rush in watching the third movie after this kind of crap.
Lame, utterly stupid jokes used in the most idiotic instances: third grade dialogue with a kindergarten story.
Corrine doesn't die until 'If there be Thornes' which is the third book in the series and even then she is allowed to redeem herself a little by saving Cathy.
Add to that the raw third world setting, which compliments the dread, presented in depressingly and dismally expository way.
However, having lived in various third world countries it seems to me that what is portrayed is a very real part of the Philipinnes, Also it does not matter because in a film we should be looking for art rather than for advertising a country.
Sadly, the third act has a riveting climax that ties up a couple of loose ends but leaves us feeling cheated.
There goes his third opportunity!
The third most ridiculous thing: Two girls are being chased by a killer the whole night, a man in a truck eventually drives down the road, he picks them up.
Starting with the awesome opening episode of "Cartaker" this seems to be off on the right foot, but somewhere along the line it became the same mind numbing drivel every week and by the third year I was so bored i tuned out of star trek completely.
Incorrect: Wikipedia quote: "at nine-year intervals, seven Athenian boys and seven Athenian girls were to be sent to Crete to be devoured by the Minotaur" The movie states 8 "youngsters" every third year.

I was already rolling my eyes after the third one.
In this third and (thank Christ) final installment in the trilogy-the action picks up directly after the events of the equally stupid second film-with Duane spending some time in a rubber-room after trying to sew him and his deformed Siamese twin brother Belial back together.
The last third of the movie isn't too bad though, delivering some decent suspense scenes, though there is probably one "twist" too many in the end.
How dumb can a Hindi movie be , when 3 people are sitting on a table and two are talking in Hindi , when the third one butts in and says 'English , Please' ?!!
And third, why would they put the reformed murderer back on the streets IN OR NEAR THE TOWN HE COMMITTED HIS CRIMES IN!?
The first direct to DVD sequel to The Art of War was surprising enough, but this third instalment, featuring the original character from the first two but with a different actor playing him in the shape of the far less charismatic Treach (Today You Die), came out of nowhere.
Supposedly a prequel to The Art Of War and Art Of War II, the third installment in the "franchise" is basically the same old thing as the others minus any real backstory that a prequel should have.
Charley was devoid of emotion and basically played the "Lolita" character with all the aplomb of a third rate community theatre actor.

While as a portrayal of a moment in time, time and the world continue after the show ends, no matter when that is, the end of this third season will conclude with only the vague prospect of maybe (and that's a BIG maybe!)
Disappears completely for about a third of the final act (When she shows up again she was just showing some dude the house, for 115 hours!)
It's hard to believe they made a third Exorcist (a surprising success, all things considered.)
The only real good thing to come out of this was to spur William Peter Blatty into helming what would become the third Exorcist film.
Okay, it's nothing a friend should do to cheat on his best friend with his wife - but hey, feelings sometimes make us do things that are not really clever, but still that's what feelings are there for in a way... and since it always takes two persons to cheat on a third one, I really could not understand what this movie wanted to express in the end.
The third is a dedicated socialist teacher well versed in Christian-baiting.
I could see some similarities too in the rapid clash and shift in emotions in "Time," and found the final third fairly compelling.
This is the third and (God help us) final entry into the Troll trilogy.
Yet we are subject to sex, sex, and more sex every third scene.
Now the movie seemed to imply she was possibly a prostitute or a mistress--but even then, it seemed silly to have her traipsing around in one glamorous gown after another in a third world nation.
Should we expect a third "Boogeyman" movie?
With only a passing reference to Tim, the main character in the first Boogeyman, this film should not be classified as a sequel because when a second (or third) film in a series is made, there should be something there to make a positive connection.
For the record, the third is The Last of Sheila, a grating foray into the mystery genre from Stephen Sondheim.
The mentionned third entry in this series, once again featuring Ben Willis, will confirm this series the 1990s equivalent to "Friday the 13th"... People will be going to see these movies to see who gets mangled, and how badly, not for plot, suspense, character, etc... Grade: F
I liked the first and third but the second was awful.
This is Cecil B. DeMille's third picture on extramarital relationships, following 'Old Wives for New' and 'Don't Change Your Husband.'
This original treatment of the play was a bit stagy but its main problem was the last third of the movie.
Wells story, the film's third act laughably tries sneaking in sort of an "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"-type plot twist--and one is nearly inclined to give the picture some extra points for its moxy.
), which culminates in a third act that apparently tries to wax philosophical in the vein of H.G.
Part of this is due to the fact that although Pacino is convincing as an experienced psychiatrist, his dyed hair isn't, nor is his ability to womanise with females around a third of his age.

Christopher Walken has once again embarrassed himself, not for being bad, for continually appearing in third rate films.
19 years later, Daytona (played by third rate Jack Black wannabe Dan Fogler) is washed up and performing ping pong tricks at a run down theatre.
I guess "Chuck and Buck" is funny, if you're the type of person who laughs at the mentally retarded, or delights in seeing a sixth grade bully beat up a third grader, or maybe if you smoke a lot of pot.
I saw the movie for the first time less than two weeks ago and saw it for the third time tonight.
IF i had the unfortunate karma to view this (expletive deleted) in a theater, i would've walked out of this horrendously bad film...it is the second worst film that i have ever seen, beating out the venerable Zabriskie Point by Antonioni (which i walked out on the first time i saw it) which is now the third worst film i've ever seen....but i must admit that there is some pretty horrible (expletive deleted) out there which have forced me to appreciate Zabriskie Point more now...
And third,why couldn't they have had one of the hulk's famous arch enemies appear in the film?

This time, the third guy is a young boy.
An equally imbecile husband who finds the third imbecile in the movie to make love to his wife.
To make it worse, the last scene leaves the door wide open for a third movie... if it does happen, why not cast Scarlett Johansson or Charlotte Church as the new Triple X?
The melodrama is interrupted only by sickeningly brutal scenes, including a woman in third trimester being kicked in the abdomen.
Not once was there a discussion or revelation as to what made Derrida such a legend (at least so I'm told), little if anything about is family life (except at in the last third of the film), and the clips that were edited in made him appear like an incorrigible Frenchman with a sense of humor, which he may be but I got the picture very early on in the film.
If you are into women-in-prison films, "Escape from Hell" in any good copy near the 89 minute Italian/Spanish original, would entitle you to watch the most erotic, and violent, nude lesbian fight - for possession of the third girl in a cell, between black Ajita Wilson and queen-bee Cintia Lodetti; and a gun duel between the same black fugitive and a Nazi female warden (Christina Lay?)
By the way, Ruby herself inexplicably vanishes from the proceedings during the last third or so!
The wonderfully philosophical script may be thought provoking for some, provided they do not possess anything more than a third grade education.
There are three tests, but what's the third?
Another opponent, with 4 arms, supposed to be the third toughest, has a 2 second role and dies by a falling object!
The first third of this film was promising, but it got so badly out of hand by the end that I can't seriously recommend anyone bother watching it.
No surprise - about what you would expect from a third rate network.
The movie is a genuine American original, and by the final third I couldn't wait to see it again from the start.
What's sort of cool in the story is the early misdirection which seems to implicate Tex Preston (Billy Platt) as a cattle rustler before it's revealed there's a third party villain working the Preston's against the Lawson's.
Pathetic would be a good word, amateur would be another, and just to give you that third scoop, she was unbelievable at best.

This is the third film from Director Tobe Hooper (known mainly for his cult classic "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre").
This is the third and final film in Baum's personally produced Oz trilogy of 1914.
Hell, the whole rotten movie is a "spoiler")  Upon viewing the opening third of this movie, I swear I thought the film had been written by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (the talentless brothers behind such pieces of dung such as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, and ME, MYSELF, AND IRENE) because the film assaulted the audience with embarrassingly crude, off-color, profanity-ridden dialogue.
I doubt I will be willing to even sit through the third.
I finally caught on when, with the third girl, he freelances all night, then comes home to Christa and kisses her and says he wants to try to kick the habit.

Sellers' third wife, Lynne Frederick, won a $1.475 million lawsuit against the makers of this film.
Supposedly, for the third time in the series, the actual "Pink Panther", the stone that Claudia Cardinale was struggling to hold onto in the first film, is the center of a robbery - a successful one.
And in the early 1970s, the third Pink Panther film had resurrected Sir Charles and Lady Lytton with the jewel robber being played by Christopher Plummer.
Well, if he is good in the future, sure, watch this crap and wonder how he ever got to make a third one.
The original two Hellraiser films are absolute classics, and while I quite liked the boisterous third part - I'd really rather they stopped making sequels after Hellbound.
Certainly the third passenger, was the most fascinating.
Director Tobe Hooper's masterful talent for crafting a raw, rattling and uncompromisingly fierce intensity that slowly, yet surely builds to a nerve-wracking fever pitch in the harrowing last third (the infamous diner table sequence is particularly horrifying) has never been matched or surpassed in either any of the subsequent sequels or in the needless and atrocious overly graphic remake.
No, but some third rate, coca-cola drinking scenario writer thought the American public would be better off with some fifteenth rate love story soap.
Who's to say that anyone might possibly have suspected that lightning wouldn't necessarily strike a third time?
The third and final tier of episodes are for miracle survivals, overweight babies (ugh), guess that tranny, or tall lanky man with short stubby woman.
I realize that the military isn't all heroes and has a lot of wasted time, money and attracts a lot of real pigs and bullies too, but these men were located in a civilized country in the middle of Europe, not in some remote third world environs.
The Sacrifice (directed by Koji Shiraishi) is the title of the third story, and although lacking in scares, it is made watchable by the presence of the gorgeous YÃ» Yamada who stars as a young woman cursed by a creepy workmate, but who is ultimately saved by her mother (who sacrifices herself to a giant disembodied head with strange eyes!).
The camera tries to make the movie seem like there is action about to happen, but after the third time of these "action" sequences that end in a protracted dialog that was, "Give me the signs boy!"
Sorry, couldn't think of a third.
Thanks for not letting us all fall back into the third Reich!
My dad was the third bigot in the credits.
Any way, the joke in our family has always been to call our father the third bigot.
The movie makes more sense in the last third, becoming a relatively straightforward action picture, but by then you're trapped in a movie with characters you don't care about making everything that happens feel trivial.
I'm about a third of the way through, and so far, i have absolutely no idea what it's purpose is supposed to be.
Now I have seen ALL of the Puppet Master movies and besides the first and third episodes the rest were pretty much crap.It's interesting however to see the Puppets start out as evil slayers for their master Andre Toulon, but then become more as heroes fighting evil in the 3rd & 4th movies.
As for the direction, I can only say this director also directed "Conflict" another third rate Bogart film.
The gore was ridiculous and the "beheading" looked like it was planned by a third grader with no knowledge of human anatomy.
His roommate is a hilarious typical wannabe-gangsta film maker who should have had lines after the first third of the film but didn't, and they bunk with a repressed homosexual fashion major used for good cheap laughs.
The first 1/3 is a comedy with dramatic elements, the second third is a drama with comedic elements, and the final third is a bizarre dark fantasy that ends in a way I can only describe as "suddenly I am run over by a truck".
I saw this movie on TNT a few months ago, for only about the second or third time in my life.
This was never proved and, in fact, the entire religion actually comes off looking legitimate, especially with the fantasy shot in which the guru touches Ruth's forehead and a third eye opens up in her forehead, which suggests that this guru actually does have spiritual powers, which contradicts the rest of the film.
i had seen the third many times, so i thought it would be a great film to laugh at.
Only in the surprisingly dynamic and exciting last third does this flick finally spring to life, but by then it's much too little way too late to compensate for the general tedium which preceded it.
Amazingly enough, this was the third Billy Jack film (after The Born Losers and Billy Jack) and the first to bomb at the box office.
At least a third of the movie is lengthy, droning performances of atrocious excuses for "music", by people with no talent (most egregiously, Laughlin's daughter Teresa).
I don't know any reason why anyone would want to see this or, for that matter, make this truly tasteless, unimaginative, amorphous, poor imitation of a third rate parody.
The concept of a serial killer with supernatural powers who desperately attempts to transfer his murderous spirit into a new body after his own execution is dreadfully unoriginal and already featured (more or less) in at least four movies, namely Wes Craven's "Shocker", the atrocious third entry in the "House" series, the criminally underrated film "Prison" and the overall lamentable film "The Chair".
The third thing that I love about horror films is the pretext for helplessness.
And the third worst thing about it is that it goes to pathetic lengths in its melodramatic attempts at heart-strings-tugging.
Hopelessly clichÃ©d sentimentality and schmaltz are quite annoying and the film really falls apart in the last third, mostly because of the double-birth scene which is incredibly lame and unfunny, clumsily "written" and directed; the gags in the birth scenes are so bad it's embarrassing to watch.
all i could think was that there was a third choice: beat the kidnapper into a pulp, take his ass back to your apartment, and torture the information out of him.
What then happens it that we see the third person involved in her fate and this is why the film really gets under your skin.
And the third is a so-so story of a game of double dare played between a man and woman who work across the street from each other.
Decent plot, cool fight scenes, and good acting(personally I like Treat Williams better)and was excited to find out a third was coming w/ Treat Willliams.
The third chapter consists of Williams kicking some student's asses but in reality he is more engaged with fighting the mob and therefore the whole story loses it's edge.
The actor was a real dud and a third class aadi aal.. nothing else!
This was the third movie of him that i have seen(the first and second being GWH and DD) and its probably the last one of his movies that i am gonna see.
I did not even know there was a third installment to the Urban Legends series, but after loving the first two, for what they were, and this one being directed by Mary Lambert (who I adored for her work with Madonna and "Pet Sememtary"), I expected a descent movie.
On the third and final "Bloody Mary," the friends are kidnapped by three jocks and return soon thereafter, shaken but well.
Here we have the third instalment of the Urban Legend franchise, this time changing it up (yeah, such a smart idea).
The third Urban Legend should have been a slasher, fright fest.
It's also a true bridge between the first film, which was sexless TV-movie camp, and the third one, which was mindlessly dull soft-core.
He's got that greasy, unwashed look to him like he's on a three-day bender and has had one too many bottles of Scotch and just finished his third pack of cigarettes before noon.
all the locals in the bar are vampires.Dusk till dawn 2:Texas blood money though was a whole different kettle of fish.It is a poorly thought out ploy to cash in on a successful movie.Don't get me wrong i'm a huge fan of bad films and commend them if they are in any way inventive or resourcefull,this wasn't.Texas blood money also made use of annoying camera shots it persevered with every point of view shot possible.We had the shot from the pov of a man doing press-ups,we had the shot through the red eyes of a bat and to top it off the pov from a fan moving left to right.Overall it is a highly frustrating film that should never have been made,their certainly shouldn't have been a third installment.Never see this if you haven't,and if you have i feel for you and hope the counciling is going well.
This second sequel, made back to back with the third, attempts to cash in on the profitability of the original movie.
This gives no honor to the first in any way, they should have stayed with the first and the third to make the perfect duo.
Ginger Snaps is probably the first great werewolf movie to have a worthy sequel, and if that wasn't enough they had to go and do it again a third time.
These two visually striking films had powerful plots, something his third fiction movie "Casa de Areia" (House of Sand) has only a frail thread of.
The third (and worst) Matt Helm spy-yarn, it is offensive, stupid, witless, and--worst of all deadly sins--boring.
The third Matt Helm film - and easily the weakest up to this point.
Now I have seen ALL of the Puppet Master movies and besides the first and third episodes the rest were pretty much crap.It's interesting however to see the Puppets start out as evil slayers for their master Andre Toulon, but then become more as heroes fighting evil in the 3rd & 4th movies.
Another third of the movie is occupied by long pauses voiced-over with "poetic" inner monologue which sounds like it was written by an over-ambitous (and overly confident) college film major.
On The third of November 2004, Muslim extremists assassinated director Theo Van Gogh because of his inglorious portrayals of their culture and beliefs.
This is the third entry in the series after The Addams Family (1991) & Addams Family Values (1993) which were very good films, Addams Family Reunion isn't.
This was supposed to be Julia's third installment as Gomez, had he not died.
The third Addams Family installment is an complete and utter insult to the Addams Family Name.
I have only seen two episodes of the second season of this series and hope a third season isn't in the works.
One of my friends also said that I have to see "Bride" and "Seed" for the Chucky series, but I didn't want to see those without understanding maybe a few things I missed in the third or second Child's Play.
Don't even bother with The Quickening, just watch the first movie and then skip to the third one (after all, that's what the producers did).
They should have called the third installment "Highlander 2: forget about that last thing, will ya?"
Highlander III, not exactly itself a great sequel, ignored this one completely as ironically it left no outlet for a third episode but it too was a cynical cash-in and could only continue the first film by ignoring its ending whereas the forth in the series simply didn't bother with the first film at all, opting instead to go with the spin-off T.V series.
After the third and fourth, you get that the interactions are awkward and playing off of the actors' real-life personas in an ironic way.
This is the third Haneke film I've seen (Funny Games and Cache being the others), and it is pretty obvious to me that it is the first one he made.
The new writing/directing team of Megan Martin and Brett Sullivan pick up where the previous film left off, skillfully bridging the two with a bare minimum of rehashed exposition, and the end result is extremely satisfying (though the machinations of "Unleashed"'s final third made me wish the script had tied some thematic/character arcs together better).
The third tale involves a homicidal maniac whose identity you'll probably figure out long before it's "revealed."
The only story that even made me a little creeped out was the third one.
The third is just about some girls messing with these guys trying to scare them.
The third story is kinda cool.
I fell asleep for the beginning of the third story and didn't even bother rewinding it, because by that time I'd learned that seeing the whole thing still wouldn't make it make any more sense.
It should be pointed that Louise is 18 and well above the age of consent but I couldn't help thinking this doesn't make it all right in anyway and I watched this the same day as a certain Scottish football team revealed that their new coach was someone who spent time in jail for having sex with a 15 year old so sure as heck I wasn't going to empathise with the characters   Problem number one: I couldn't empathise with the characters but that's not the major problem with the script which lies in its contrived over complicated nature in the last third .

At Least Riget actually exists in real life (the Hospital in Copenhagen is Nicknamed "Riget" which Means "Kingdom", Due to it's Extreme size) And to round it all off, maybe Stephen could have continued the series instead of remaking it, since two actors died after making the second one (hence why there isn't gonna be a third).
2 seasons of Riget was made and a third was planned, but it was canceled because some of the actors died.
First episodes of third season made no sense at all, like if story was being invented during filming by passing-by random people, having no idea about global and even episode-local plot.

The third story.. well, I think it was about some weird monster with wings..

The movie version released in 1964 faithfully represented the book as it was written and you felt the coldness of what I believe is the best third person narrative description I have ever read.
The third person narrative of the book was almost like a character in the story and it was palpable, cold, and horrible in it's indifference and was captured in the 1964 movie perfectly.

However, with the release of Hellraiser: Hellworld, the third direct-to-video sequel directed by Rick Bota (whose previous entries, Hellseeker and Deader, actually gave me fleeting moments of hope for the Hellraiser series), not only has Pinhead caved (and this is a level of caving that no one could ever imagine, a level even worse than the one he stooped to in Hell on Earth), but the whole idea and principle of the series has caved to a point of extreme embarrassment.
Given that the National Board of Reviewers ranked "Closer" as the third best movie of 2004 (behind "The Aviator" and "Finding Neverland"), I'm still stunned at how patently ridiculous it was.
I think these stories were meant to be over the top, but the third one was where it went bad.
The third story was just a total rip off the the original Zooney hunting doll, the exact same stunts were used along with the exact same lines, the funny thing is, I don't think it was possible, but the woman was definitely more stupid and deserved to be... well... you know.
Then the third story was about the Zooney Hunting Fetish Doll that has murdered two women, but the police think it's a cult type of murder and give the doll to a scientist in a museum, but little does she know the horror that comes with having this doll by her side.

The crew of the submarine Lorelei believe that they are fighting for their homeland and the future of Japan and hence sacrifice themselves at the end of the movie by surfacing on the water (even though the area is surrounded by US fleets) so that they can take down the US airplane which was carrying the third atom bomb heading for another drop in Japan.
Also there are more and more inconsistencies in the power of Peter Petrelli (replicating other's power) which is automatic when needed by the script (regeneration, be invisible, becoming radioactive etc..) and inoperative when really useful (replicating Sylar's powers at first, second or even third encounter, time travel from Hiro and so on) and not to mention that he never uses the ones he really need when he needs them (unlike Sylar), why did it take him the last episode to listen to anyone's mind (aside from the accidental encounter with Parkman), and why does he need his brother to fly him and play the firework while he can fly all by himself (his first ever duplicated power).
I've only seen the third episode, but for the most part it's about as unfunny and derivative as his previous effort.
With a modicum of witty repartee, some excellent carnival locations, and an unusual villain (a master spy whose cover is playing a sideshow mechanical man), this one might have ascended from third to second rate, were it not for Morris's acting (mostly a matter of flashing a grin that looks too wide for his face) and his hat (its too-small brim accentuates his big square face and makes him look stupid amongst all the elegant, wide-brimmed hats worn by everybody else, even the weaselly villains).
I heard that the third one is the worst in the series-boy, I don't even want to think about that.
Sorry I lied Blackbeard isn't "the next best" at anything, the pirate that was at my third birthday party was more of man then Blackbeard.

For a ponderous example of why this franchise is going nowhere fast, just take a gander at the third entry in the series, Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre III.
The Wild Women of Wongo is their third release as The Film Crew (Hollywood After Dark and Killers from Space being the first two) and easily the most funny.

Talk about a third rate comic, this guy is worse than that.
This episode is my third ONE star.

"Necronomicon" is an analogy of three short stories:1)"The Drowned"(Christophe Gans)2)"Cold"(Shusuke Kaneko)and 3)"Whispers"(Brian Yuzna).In my opinion,the first one is the best one maybe because it's highly atmospheric and a little bit creepy.It has also very appealing cast(Bruce Payne,Richard Lynch or wonderful Belinda Bauer).The second one is very weak:boring and full of uninteresting characters.I didn't enjoy it.The third one is too bizarre and also very ridiculous.It has some nice gore effects and nothing more.I suggest you to watch only the first story-"The Drowned".Don't bother with rest.My evaluation:4/10 perhaps 5/10.
The third one, though?

It just gets thrown into the movie's third act so they could rip off the climax of Cameron's "Aliens".

Diane was originally played Maureen O'Sullivan (Farrow's real-life mother), Howard by Charles Durning and Waterston was only the third choice for Peter after Christopher Walken and Sam Shepard.
A third person goes looking, all alone, and not surprisingly, finds himself dead pretty soon.

Lucy, the third oldest, the drama queen sister.
To me the third one would have been their only real peer as an actress who could play anything: Barbara Stanwyck.
One of the big stinkers, BUT well worth watching the first third to Irene Hervey, surely one of the most beautiful women in her day, in a very form-fitting leather, sharkskin gown.
By the time you've heard Harper's Bizarre sing the title tune for the third time you'll want to strangle 'em.
This one is a close third.
The second third of the film suffers from this predictability.
It should be noted that the two hardly talk to each other throughout the entire film, which makes the last third of the film illogical and stupid.
I'll pass on the third viewing.
While The Woods doesn't feature much in the way of blood and gore, McKee skilfully manages to work some schlock sequences into the film, and the frenzied final third brilliantly offsets the slow build of the first two.
Ultimately, as this film is edited, about one third of the screen time is devoted to sexual activities that have little or nothing to do with the story-line.

New Jersey State just didn't go for it a third time as 20 years had gone.
"L'ora di religione" (The religion class) is an awful third rate movie whose main purpose is to ridicule the acts of canonization in an apodictic tone, even with a blasphemous curse uttered in the name of the art of cinema.
The third segment, that is the only good one in this movie, is a sick and totally goofy version of Goldylocks, with the blonde girl as a crazy serial killer of young boyfriends that makes a strange alliance with the Bear family (in fact, a sort of mixture between Bonnie and Clyde and a farmer family coming out of Lil Abner) and find her true love in Baby.
Finally, the third and final story is a black comedy that has the viewer forced to follow the path of three escaped mental patients who shard a country house with a character by the name of Goldi Lox.
I didn't see the third story because I was falling asleep by then and turned the TV off.
The third story concerns a town of the beaten path inhabited by nothing but ghouls.
The second and third stories are forgettable and therefore the overall affect of the movie is a negative one.
The third story, a Ghoul story, is a lot better than the other two, and the only part of the film that has a certain creepiness.
I cried for two third of the movie.
My problem is, it just goes to far with it and spends waaay to much time there, over a third of the film, about 40 minutes and then cleans it all up in less than 10.

Shark Bait (aka: The Reef) sports an all star cast (and I use the term rather generously), but is badly marred by a weak story line, horrendous dialogue, cheesy references to other films, and third rate computer animation.
Unfortunately, where Aliens in particular excelled was that it managed to give every character a third dimension.
The two first series are great, the third one is not too bad (fortunately, Melissa George was here), but then it got really bad.
I finally shut it down during the scene with Garry Marshall, after they were interrupted for the third time by some extremely contrived, embarrassing spectacles, culminating in Jack Black's entrance in his underwear.
Second, the beginning was stupid, and third, a lot of boring dialog and bad actors.
Many times the duologue goes into ridiculous, incomprehensible speech such as third dimensions, and whatnot.

In part because of a fair amount of humor and whimsy but also because of the introduction of a third alternative to living.
I've just seen the movie, for the third time, on TV past midnight yesterday and I couldn't close my eyes.
This movie is like a lacking "Mafia" with a third of the energy.

The supernatural, vengeful police officer is back for a third installment, this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop.
Matt Cordell is back from the dead for a third go-round, although I'm not sure anyone cared at this point except for rabid MANICA COP fans.
Crash just consists of a bunch of random sex scenes between two characters we don't even know in the first third, then consists of sex scenes between two characters we don't even give a damn about in the second third before trying to end up as some sort of tragic, poetic love story about two people who have now discovered what really sexually turns them on.
The third season DVD set also includes the reunion, set in 1950.
I was excited about playing another sneaker, after the Thief series was lacking the third part for a long time, so I thought I give splinter cell a try.
This third film, written and directed by a young filmmaker, J.T.
Petty Mimic: Sentinel is the third film in the Mimic series & you know a series is in trouble when they stop numbering them after only the first two & as if by magic my fears are confirmed with this distinctly average at best horror/thriller.
For the disgusting effects and the, more or less, tension throughout the pictures, but this third was a bunch of crap.

If this was actually the script for the third Conan film, it's easy to see why Arnie said no.
This was the third.
If theaters gave refunds when people were dissatisfied with a movie, this turkey would have been dropped like a hot potato the third day out.
In the third scene, champagne glass beside his feet, we notice his aim isn't quite what it was, and the title takes on rather a different, less iconic meaning.
8/2/08: So now we're already in the third season, with Brandy having been replaced by Sharon Osbourne - a major improvement - and Jerry Springer replacing Regis (not so much).
I assume that a second or third write was never thought of before filming and that nobody thought to expand on the story a bit.
I was positively sure as to who was committing the murders by the second to third dead victim.
In its favour, the plot was not entirely predictable, but I was left not really caring what happened less than a third of the way through.
I absolutely despise when somebody reviews a movie that they did not even watch through, but *I* could not finish this movie.. for only the third time ever ( the first, being the pitiful remake of Rollerball, and second being that miserable piece of rancid feces, Freddy Got Fingered).
The third movie produced by Howard Hughes, this gem was thought to be lost.
I think it is definitely better than the third one (in Rome) though.
the Plot Summary is wrong ,the Germany militar from the third story of the movie is not in Brazil, he is located in Buenos Aires Argentina , anyway the locations doesn't look at all like Buenos Aires , there is no doubt it was filmed in other place , everything is wrong , Argentine people don't look like Mexican and do not sing "cielito,,,"(typical Mexican song) in the restaurants, the national music in Argentina is tango, very disappointing , i guess that the director didn't know much about this culture , and the person who made the plot summary didn't see the movie very well .
The first segment is about a swine nephew who kills his uncle in order to inherit his fortune; the second segment is about a blind woman who gets an eye transplant; and the third segment is about a former Nazi who is trying to escape his past, but a Holocaust survivor denies him of that.
The third tale, "The Escape Route"(..directed by Barry Shear) follows a Nazi named Strobe(Richard Kiley, with a scar covering one eye for extra impact)hiding away in South Africa, haunted by memories of his war crimes and constantly looking over his shoulder worried about being caught by agents who specialize in hunting "his kind" out.
The third was the true classic, with Richard Kiley giving a masterfully performance of a vicious horrible creature, a Nazi war criminal who thinks he merits leniency after years on the run.
The first segment is appropriately spooky; the second ingenious and unconventional (for TV); and the third, even though it is the weakest, a worthy capper on this film.
Avoid the third installment as it will positively ruin the viewing experience.
The third tale of the trilogy, "Escape Route," is probably the most like the classic "Twilight Zone," dark and brooding; yet least successful as a thriller.
The whole thing resembles a half breed- Altmans "Short Cuts" and Quentins "Pulp Fiction" We wish there would be a chance for a second or a third EisbÃ¤r Movie...
Wing Commander was one of the first real interactive movies when the third installment was released in 94, it pushed the boundaries for graphics, acting and storyline into uncharted heights for a video game.
The cameras are always centered on Lt. Blair, so the shape of the Killrathi is shrouded in mystery until the third quarter of the movie.
But the scenario being depicted shows the Kilrathi imminently approaching Earth, which was one of the available scenarios in the third video game, which in turn is set decades into the war.
Despite its baffling ultra-rarity, the film is peopled by an interesting pool of talent both in front and behind the camera: Lancaster is in his third adventure flick; Gilbert Roland is his usual laid-back, womanizing Latino self; John Dehner the proverbial rotten apple in the group; George Tobias (perhaps thankfully) sacrifices himself early on; Nick Dennis and Mike Mazurki are among the rowdiest of the 'Ten'; Gerald Mohr adequately provides the required villainy; this was the second product from Norma Productions (which first partnered Lancaster with producer Harold Hecht); writer Roland Kibbee would much later go on to share directorial credit with Lancaster on THE MIDNIGHT MAN (1974; which I will be revisiting presently); associate producer Robert Aldrich would later direct Lancaster in four movies Â including TWILIGHT'S LAST GLEAMING (1977; which I'll be viewing for the first time during this ongoing Burt Lancaster tribute); and, most interestingly perhaps, this was multi-talented Willis Goldbeck's most notable directorial effort but, at least two of his screen writing credits are highly impressive indeed: Tod Browning's FREAKS (1932) and John Ford's THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (1962; Goldbeck's last film work)!
War of the worlds(2005) , Altered(2006), Contact(1997) Close encounters of the third kind (1977).

Unlike Skulls 2, this third actually spends time detailing the grueling process of becoming a skull, Skulls 2 skipped all that and just repeated the same scenes from the original, the only thing skulls 2 had differently was a breasts.
I read one criticism which stated that the third quarter of the movie (Jack's return and Matt's epiphany)was boring and slowed down the plot.
The third man, and head, of the group of robbers Jim Harris was a lot harder and far more dangerous nut to crack and find by Nick and his hoods.
Across 110th Street is really one third cop character piece, one third Mafia crime/revenge thriller, and one third (black) social drama.

When they hatch, it's immediately discovered one is a "Caruso," the next is a violinist like Fritz Kreisler, the third is a Mendelsohnn.
It's the third filmed version of a play that must have already been stale back in the twenties.
Perhaps because Desi Arnaz was the only Cuban in Hollywood (he seems like a third string talent compared to that era's Cesar Romero and Ricardo Montalban)?
ran for something 140 minutes originally & that Paramount cut huge chunks out of it including a lot of footage with him in it which I find very easy to believe, James name is third in the opening credits yet he comes across as a glorified extra.
Interestingly James is third in the opening credits while Murphy & Nolte come first & second although unlike the first film Murphy is now credited first & Nolte second which says something all on it's own.
Apparently this made near $20,000,000 in it's opening weekend which I would imagine is a decent amount even for films released today so it's maybe a bit puzzling a third 48 Hrs.
In the third act however--that is, after Brutus and Cassius have fled Rome--he seems to grow in the part and his acting gains conviction.
I haven't seen the third installment yet but even if that one holds true in quality to this one number two becomes the odd one out.
Staying right with the third installation's method of haphazardly taping together some goofy, inconsequential plot out of a few recent horror flicks (this time Saw, Grudge, and Village get the honors) to produce yet another stagnant parody that produces yet another few hilarious moments.
Anthony Anderson and Leslie Nielsen return from the third film in the same roles and newcomer Craig Bierko plays a parody of Tom Cruise.
For the third time this year comes a movie that on paper sounds like good ol' fashioned campy Nazi fun, and then turns out to be something quite a bit different than its premise, turning it in directions it really doesn't need to go.
Or that he later hammers a hole in his forehead before tearing off his face and growing a third eye?
It is this premise that is actually used as a platform of greater things, something that allows a certain fascination in third parties initially unaware, but also gets across a certain sense of well-being.
(There may have been more in the first third of the movie but I missed that part.)
Ignited by Kirk Douglas's terrifically brutal performance as Shields, the film is incessantly watchable - similar in structure and perspective to Orson Welles's "Citizen Kane" - as the story tracks his rise to the top and fall from grace through three primary relationships - the first with Fred Amiel, a director with whom Shields partners early in their careers, the second with Georgia Lorrison, an alcoholic bit player and daughter of a Hollywood legend whom Shields grooms to become a big star, and the third with James Lee Bartlow, a writer whom Shields tries to make a screenwriter in spite of the constant interruptions by Bartlow's southern belle wife Rosemary.
I believe a third was never made.
In the opening sequences of the film, we see three Hollywood big-shots; one, an actress, the other a director, and the third, a writer.

There's a small complaint that the final battle is all too brief, but that's a touch offset by a hillside C Troop/Apache battle that takes place in the first third of the film.
After the third time, I was lost for words.
A typical murder mystery might be deciphered halfway through, with the protagonist fingering the villain in the third act, and everyone goes on to live happily ever after.
Takeshi's third film (after "Violent Cop" and "Boiling Point") seems to of hit the right note in blending quirky humour and sudden violence.
At perhaps a third of the way into the film, it makes a sudden transition from this gangster life to a period of forced inactivity.
This film reminds me of so much of my own youth, and August Diehl's (Karl Koch) acting is perfect, that me and my wife now had to see it for the third time.
And if it were not enough to constantly go up and down lanes and paths and trails and tracks, you go up and down into and out of the ground, you dig out and fill up and dig in and refill up and dig out again and fill up a third time and dig up this time and fill down for the last time.
"If These Walls Could Talk" is a disturbing and yet emotionally powerful film that's set in the same house on the same street over three different decades (the first segment takes place in the early 1950's, the second is set in the mid-1970's and the third in the mid-1990's...all tumultuous eras in which issues affecting females and their bodies have been brought to the forefront).
It really is abysmal when you get morons making a sequel (and heaven forbid a third instalment, this time the actor playing Edvard has gone and is played by someone else again) which they proceed to ruin completely.
I hope that Plaza's third film will be as good as "The Second Name", so we can count on him to make nice fantastic-terror movies (just like AmenÃ¡bar or BalaguerÃ³ do).

Then, we get profiles of the top players, from the young prodigy who first entered the tournament at 16 and is one of the favorites to win at 20; the veteran who always is in the finals but never can do better than third; to the gay guy who is seen at home playing pinball with his roommate.
The third part (and the bulk of the film) covers the 28th American Crossword Puzzle Tournament held in March, 2005 in Stamford, CT.
Once the film turns its attention toward the tournament, the personalities of the top contenders are highlighted with the makings of a classic showdown among three-time champion and professional puzzle-maker Trip Payne; Al Sanders, the middle-aged perennial also-ran who can never seem to rank above third; and prodigious twenty-year old Tyler Hinman, the potential usurper who could become the youngest champion ever.
This movie was even better the second and third time around.
A would-be hillbilly-turn cop avenges his younger brother's murder in a lawful manner, while a third brother goes about it in typical redneck-hillbilly style, causing more problems and endangering them both, as well as the pregnant wife of Truman (Swayze).
Having watched this for the third time, it kills me to think what Jusy Garland went through to amuse and entertain us.
The material is too second rate and the actor's are too third rate to carry this anywhere but the nearest lowest price blockbuster bargain bin.
But the film does it's usual share of flaws, especially during the third act but Myrick certainly does take his time by making the movie works.
It requires attention from the viewer, and plays at a leisurely pace compared to many films currently in theaters, and some of the more action oriented beats don't quite gel with the rest of the film, but for those who can appreciate a story that gives itself room to breath, and for those willing to forgive the overly long third act, there is plenty to love.
Overall I had to push "2x" faster button many many (too many) times to not fall asleep for a third time.
Louisa is soon bored by this man, and falls for the blandishments of Mr. James Harthouse, a Member of Parliament and the third villain in the novel.
If, by their third meeting, you haven't figured out that Hutton not only can walk but is the child-raping murderer to boot, you haven't seen enough movies of this genre.
Moreover, Hanson astutely nails the whole right-on groovy swingin' 70's zeitgeist, evokes a highly credible sense of everyday mundane reality and builds plenty of nerve-wracking tension which reaches a harrowing fever pitch in the terrifying final third.
The third act with the dead was very moving, I just can't say enough good things about this version of Our Town.
This is definitely a third rate movie.
The ever-cool Richard Roundtree, who along with the equally awesome John Saxon has played more cops than any other actor alive, makes his third appearance as John Shaft, the super-tough, super-smooth, oh-so-hot black private dick who's a sex machine to all the chicks and a most gnarly guy who's always getting into loads of trouble.
This is the third Lisa Gastoni "mignotta-movie" (to borrow a phrase from Italian Euro-Cult authority Marco Giusti) I've watched Â after THANK YOU AUNT (1968) and Fernando Di Leo's SEDUCTION (1973) Â in which a middle-aged woman is seduced by a much younger man.
But two stories, the one of Carlos and that of Mikel, end up with nothing and the third, the story of Ana, makes a turn without any reason.
Hopkins has one of her best roles as a free-loving woman who loves two men but marries a third.
Although not as gruesome as the third world italian cannibal film cycle( the whole film takes place in Atlanta, GA)there are scenes of exreme violence: eye gougings, face smashings.
The last Hammer Horror film features Nastassja Kinski in only her third film, and her first major role.
Honor "Pussy Galore" Blackman offers a bright performance as Widmark's agent and Denholm Elliott of the first and third "Indiana Jones" films is perfectly jittery as Kinski's guilt-plagued father.
With both a hit and a miss in their hands, Disney's third and final theme park adaptation, The Haunted Mansion, could swing either way but the company executives would have it be a hit for sure.
It's just disappointing when the worst performance in an unambitious action movie comes from a supposedly competent big name, and the best from a martial artist for whom English is a second (or third, for all I know) language.
The third season sticks out in my mind more than any other.
(Is it my imagination, or is every third film about coming of age in one way or another?)
Producer Howard Hughes became a Hollywood power with the very successful release of this, his third motion picture.
It's his third run in with the law since his father died in a car accident a year earlier.
I'm not a big fan of Smith's work, as I've only caught his first three flicks and I still think his third film "Chasing Amy" is the best.
The script by Robert Sabaroff was based on the novel 'The Seventh' by Donald E. Westlake can be divided into three chunks, the first third of the film revolves around the recruiting of the team with some fun set-pieces to make sure each member is up to the task, the second third of the film is my favourite when they carry out the heist & there's that feeling that you root for them & you want to get away with it & all the close calls they have & watching the plan unfold is pretty fun, then the final third of the film is perhaps the weakest as several random events come together & tear the thieves apart & it becomes a rather dull runaround after the money which goes missing through no fault of their own but does obviously cause problems as they don't know who to trust.
This ridiculous third act smacks of desperation, and leaves Gene Hackman (as a somewhat dirty detective) with nothing but absurdity to play opposite.
At first, through the first third of the movie, I was sure that the film was an allegory about the architect's family and friends never actually noticing him (or his moustache).
After the success of the hilarious Lion King 1 1/2, the third Little Mermaid (Ariel's Beginning) definitely made par - Cinderella III: A Twist in Time also lives up to the standard set by both it's predecessor and what we've come to expect from Disney sequels.
Thus the first segment of II, starting right after Cinderella's honeymoon, has already happened in the beginning of Twist, but time is then rewound; the third segment with Anastasia and the Baker happens entirely after Twist; and the second segment, which was the stupid little story about the mice, is completely irrelevant.
The third main-character is Kurt Russell, who plays Karen's badly done to boyfriend.
Being the third in the Metroid series, "Super Metroid" takes everything that was ever great from the first two "Metroid" and "Metroid II: The Return of Samus" and makes everything better.
Is there going to be a third season?
"The Leopard Man" is the third and the last horror film made by Jacques Tourner in collaboration with RKO's producer Val Lewton, others being "Cat People" and "I walked with a Zombie".
The third movement focuses on Clo-Clo, and the castanets, though present, are used sparingly.
Director Jacques Tourner here had his third and final teaming with Lewton (after "The Cat People" and "I Walked with a Zombie") and he really ratchets up the tension in some scenes.
Maybe the third time will be a charm.
The third happens to the castanet player, whose fortune teller turns up the ace of spades for her several times in a row without fail.
A feeling of dread infects the first third of the movie; dark figures shamble around alleyways as the characters walk past, a man sits silently in Kay's bar sweating and acting strangely, rats scurry around nearby gutters and televisions begin reporting strange events.
As many other viewers, I didn't care much for the first half(well, part... it's a third of the projects full length, with a running time of about 25 minutes), "Fiction".
The third movie is a lackluster mystery of sorts with Tom Lawrence at his worst.
That physicality is what makes the final third of the film as heartbreaking as it is.
The third story was just plain bizarre but was by far the most original and creative out of the three tales.
Beauty and the Beast is the best not because it was nominated for best picture, or because it was listed third in Roger Ebert's top ten list, but because it is the best.
The third sequence finds them performing what looks like a pre cursor to the MTV style of music video,with the band (with Billy Preston,on organ)playing 'Two Of Us','Let It Be',and a far superior version of 'The Long & Winding Road',without the cloying strings of Phil Spector in the background.
Genre-star Maurizio Merli stars in the role of Comissario Betti for the third time (the first two Commissario Betti films were Marino Girolami's "Roma Violenta" of 1975 and "Italia A Mano Armata" of 1976, two priorities on my list of films that I haven't seen yet).
And in true Cronenberg style, this prophecy becomes quite literal in the third act (think Vincent D'Onofrio in "Men in Black").
Most of the action takes place in the last third of the picture, but there is a great suspense building up to that point.
The heights of lunacy are reached in the last third when one ludicrous plot-twist trips over the next.
It is my third favorite.
I wonder what would have happened to her if she'd got a third scene!!
The third time is the charm for James Ponsoldt, writer, director and actor in a really touching indie film that everyone can relate to.
But, I shouldn't be going on too much because the film world is something I know very little about considering I'm a third grade teacher...

The third character was played by (Khaled El Sawwy) & in my opinion he was the best in role reflecting the character of the news reporter (Hazem Farid) who is very keen on his work but at night his sexual fantasies appear as being GAY & searching for poor men to sleep with him at night.
And Kate Beckinsale is a perfect third piece to the puzzle; When the conversations in the movie occur, you never get the feeling you're watching a contrived conversation written by someone else, you get the feeling you're watching real life unfold.
Upon arrival, they are branded whores and gang-raped--the third one, however, is allowed to "join them" and goes back to kill the fourth.
Why would the US government blow up the third building ('building 7') with bombs, hours after the attack?
And yet Dylan Avery was allowed to live and make his "documentaries" that could bring down the whole government-system, and he has also been allowed to make a second and now even a third version of his film (he keeps updating them, because he has to replace his exposed his old lies and disproved facts with new lies and facts).
They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he's from Chile, remember), hides on the island.
Two of those points are for a touching scene in which Kim Poirier demonstrates a third dimension to her character, and Meghan Ory.
The answer to the third question is...NO!!
