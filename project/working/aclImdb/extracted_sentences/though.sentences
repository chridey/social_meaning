Charles Vidor's direction, though rather static, is fantastic and showcases his stars well.
Just for a moment, it seems as though he really will change, but the film is too canny for any sort of pat resolution.
If co-star Frank Sinatra got to sing the cream of the score in Young At Heart - Just One Of Those Things, Someone To Watch Over Me, One For My Baby, whilst she was stuck with the crowd-pleasing cotton candy confection - Ready, Willing And Able, Hold Me In Your Arms - with which she was identified, in Love Me or Leave Me she got to perform virtually the whole score, which, though not boasting anything like the quality of the Sinatra numbers in YAH was not exactly chopped liver.
Suffice it to say that though Cagney walks away with the picture as you would expect Day is only three or four steps behind while Robert Keith (who had played her father in YAH) scores well in the thankless nice-guy role as an agent.
One thing is certain though, and that's the sentiment expressed to Marty Snyder just before the curtain falls - "You gotta give her credit, the girl can sing..."
Two cops kill a guy, and put in some framing guns, though later they just shoot people for fun.
Doris is very curvy and plump in this movie, she looks tough and looks like she could let the limping Cagney have it and run so he couldn't catch her yet Doris portrays Ruth as weak, so it makes me wonder what the real Ruth Etting was really like, the real Ruth looks so frail and innocent, she looks as though you could knock her over with a feather but I hear she was tougher than Doris portrayed her but I guess the movie was more interesting portrayed Ruth as naive and gullible.
He is certainly fun to watch, though!
He's hoping for the big prize - i.e., Ruth - at the end of the rainbow, but though she's grateful, she's never going to be THAT grateful.
She marries him, though she's in love with a pianist, Marty Alderman.
The actors play off of each other and even though the script is lacking (and gives these characters very little to work with), it's these inspired performances that carry "Death".
I do not recommend this movie, even though Bruce Willis does good acting it does not save the movie, at all.
Robert Zemeckis, though, makes one glaring mistake during one of the key scenes.
No, this is neither a scary movie nor is Boris buried beneath layers of make-up, though he does affect spectacles and a beard.
It's not exactly a major shock that Boris Karloff plays a mad scientist in this film, though it is very unusual the way he plays this role.
I also like the Go Bot Characters, Leader 1, Sparky, Small Foot, Pathfinder, Scooter, Fitor and Cop-Tur, though it's been a while since I saw the movie and I can't remember if some of those characters were in it, alas.
I wish the movie was longer though, with more Go Bot and Rock Lord characters, particularly the more obscure ones, like Steamer.
Oh yes--- throw in Soprano's creator David Chase's strange drive in flick "Grave of the Vampire" for good measure (not nearly as good though).
The plot is fairly standard stuff too, though it never completely dries up as there's always another murder just around the corner.
Personally, she's never caught my fancy and I've never understood her appeal, though I never let her presence in a movie keep me from watching it; that would be a shame and I'd miss some good flicks if I did!
I guess it was a big hit in its time even though it's not as well known today, but my advice is to watch it if you ever get the chance.
This is the kind of film that you just end up counting among your favorites even though it's likely that no one you know has ever seen it.
throughout the movie we see that even though the Jesuits could communicate with the Natives and vice versa there was still a great amount of misunderstanding.
though this movie may not be an exact historical time-line of events it was refreshing to see a story that wasn't so one sided, at least in my opinion.
It is significant that AbbÃ© Laforgue himself is perceptive enough to realise that fact, even though their intelligence is one that he can never understand.
Leftists, too, many not appreciate it, for though it depicts the characters from their own and from each other's perspectives, the reality is that pre-colonial Native American culture was often excruciatingly cruel: as Chomina himself confesses, he is as selfish and sinful as any white man.
One complaint, though: if Moore went to this much trouble to portray the Natives speaking their own languages and AbbÃ© Laforgue praying in Latin, couldn't the French have spoken to each other in FRENCH and not English?
McInnerny is back, and going by his wish to avoid being typecast as the innocent, and remarkably stupid, Percy, he instead is cast as a slimy rival to Edmund, with the unbelievably(though based on an actual poor bugger) unfortunate surname of "Darling", creating an utterly hilarious running gag.
The episode plots also had their relevance in war, and there were also some good settings, even though there were certain anachronisms.
What is so brilliant about Blackadder Goes Forth though is how the gags cut right to the heart of the such sensitive material the stupidity of the British tactics and commanders is mercilessly exposed - and rightly so - with brilliant lines such as "a war that would have been a lot easier if we'd just stayed at home and shot fifty thousand of our men a week".
About half way through the final episode though the whole show changes and suddenly it dawns on the viewer that this is THE end.
And you can read that in as you watch and appreciate those nuances for yourself though they're not spelled out in the film.
I must admit though I didn't get any chocks but I didn't get that either when I saw the Exorcist so don't be surprised if you get scared!
!though it would seem the movie is inspired from greats like poltergeist etc.but there is something different which leave you in awe.
After saying this, even though in my mind this is possibly the best haunted house film I've ever seen it is still just that, meaning do not expect to watch this film and see it completely redefine horror because it doesn't.
But even though you realise this while watching it, the knowledge that your watching a 'haunted house' film washes away and the film completely draws you into its story and world.
Like in a comedy where the joke is built up to the punch line, the scare is given enough support before scream moment and even though a lot of them have been done before, these ones actually genuinely scare.
Like the direction she displays all the normal characteristics of a character, wrapped up in a surreal story during the course of the film; bewilderment, fear, insanity and all the other emotions a character must go though.
Belen Rueda plays a caring, compassionate mother who only wants to protect her son, though she makes mistakes that sometimes a mother makes.
The flick isn't entirely baldfaced exploitation though, with interesting questions about faith in the dialogue.
Laura's attempts to connect with everything that haunts her and her home are darkly touching, though slightly psychologically twisted.
- got wearisome as the film went on, and some of the thrills were a little cheap - I won't ruin it for anyone by revealing them - though, admittedly, they were effective all the same.
Either way, it's still worth seeing - the exploration of Laura's heart and mind are both lovely and tragic to behold, and though the film is morbid, it is beautiful as well.
I was expecting a low rent " pan's Labyrinth " but I think it might be even better than PL, though very different.
I haven't watched that many "Nunsploitation" films, but the ones I did were among the more prominent titles from the subgenre - Ken Russell's THE DEVILS (1971), Jess Franco's THE DEMONS (1972) and LOVE LETTERS OF A Portuguese NUN (1977), and Juan Lopez Moctezuma's ALUCARDA (1975) - and this one, though less well-known (which may be due to the fact that its prolific director had cut his teeth on lowbrow commercial stuff, including several "Santo" movies!
re-appearing to offer her the post of Mother Superior at the convent (the girl having conveniently murdered the current one), whereupon she discovers that her colleagues have been possessed as well, though they still end up killing her!
Beware taking a girlfriend along though.
HTML or boards mark-up is not supported though paragraph breaks will be inserted if you leave a blank line between paragraph.
This one brought back some unfunny memories (which I thought I'd share, though they have absolutely nothing, really, to do with this movie).
Even though I have ambiguous estimations about this film on the whole, I can only say for sure that "Satanico Pandemonium" is a must-see nunsploitation Mexican flick for anyone who can be pleased about these kinds of movies for their evident ridiculousness.
Tokyo Shock DVD is of good quality, not many extras (making-of featurette), though I don't know if this one really needs 'em.
And by the way I find that Nehir is extremely beautiful, my Turkish friends prefer Natalia though.
But Scorpion's revenge ain't against the system, baby, even though she does manage to fuck it up a bit on her way out; it's with the people who killed her man and sent her away, and when she breaks out with another fish in tow, a blind girl looking for her own justice against the sleazeballs who offed her Latino guitar-picker boyfriend, and discovers in a staggering revelation that her husband faked his own death in order to kill a bunch of shyster lawyers who were suing his company (not a spoiler!
The girls are in nursing school in the hospital, though it looks more like reform school.
No problem for Nick, though, he clocks her a couple of times, (the camera cuts discreetly when Lora takes it on the chin) and down she goes.
I feel sorry for Susanna Thompson though, the TV Borg queen replaced by the movie Borg queen.
Maybe she wasn't available though.
Even though the filmmaker has reigned in his wicked humor and morality-defying shock tactics, this fortunately doesn't mean he has gone all solemn on us.
The switch between scenes in English and French works well also though some of the subtitles are not so good.
Above all, she is acting as though Jean is still alive and well.
Even though the main event in the movie happens at the start, I don't dare mention it because it's surprise is important (I didn't know it was coming, and liked the way it was handled very much).
What also fascinates me is that even though the movie was realistic it was magical .
Months later, while Jean is never found, we see Marie reacting as though he still exists.
She visualizes him in various situations and the two actors (yes, Jean is present in these scenes) interact as though nothing has changed.
Even at this point, though obviously in shock, she denies that the corpse is that of her beloved Jean.
If you're into that kind of masochism though, then this is definitely your movie.
I loved their casting of Alex, though.
There is ONE remotely interesting sequence in this film, though, and that's inside the auditorium where Mr. Satan gives a lecture about good and evil.
Weller is surprisingly convincing as the Wall Street Executive going though a nervous breakdown.
I liked how this film was almost self-mocking in parts, though it always kept a straight face about it and never went to far.
One very important fact though , is that in our nation there is the freedom to air this film where as in China there is not.
A previous comment titled "Duh", at first glance, makes us all seem as though we are somehow keenly aware that civil rights are being denied...in America.
The films '80isms are not excessive though, and on the whole a little bit charming.
What is great about this stuff though is how well done it is.
And even though I believe that his teaching methods should be classified as child abuse and should be thrown in prison, the idea worked.
(Not his best movie overall, though; that honor belongs to the excellent `Kindergarten Cop'.)
Even though he can go off sometimes, it's usually for a good reason.
I didn't particularly see Azazeal as truly evil, even though he was supposed to be.
I didn't have to worry though, as I found Hex season two to be absolutely brilliant.
Towards the end they both accept their fate to fight after a little help from heaven and hell (the question though, is who actually helped whom.. an excellent twist which runs through the whole show, almost no-one seems to be only good or bad, in the end everybody makes mistakes, even big ones, and everybody have strong feelings, and acting more or less selfish from time to time.)
she has a very though fate indeed, facing a lot of sadness and only a little happiness..
Even though I really would like to see more I have trouble seeing what a 3rd season would be about, after all the evil won in the end, and the end of days came.
I think that the producers of the show should make another 5 to 6 series because at the end they just left you hanging with the characters, because almost anything could happen to them even though Malacky(sorry about my spelling) has taken over the school.
Even though nothing much happens in the movie that is really profound, you feel like you are rewarded by watching because you get to know the characters, especially Tommy, played by Buschemi.
So he gravitates to the Trees, where he can at least interact with others who seem to be in situations not entirely unlike his own, though at different stages and for different reasons.
Lars vTrier is a genius,no doubt.Everything he did,especially The Kingdom is extraordinary and very very good,shocking..but there is something that makes me feel humiliated.In Epidemic this feeling comes to its peak.It is like 'you stupid audience,watch whatever I do with your open mouth where I can put everything I want,it can be a candy or ..it'.The first I saw from him was 'Breaking the Waves' that impressed me so much that I begun waiting for the next work of the director.That was 'Dancer in the Dark'and I became a child who ate a chocolate bonbon(Danser in the Dark) after a caramelized bonbon(Breaking the Waves).In the meanwhile I found the opportunity to see Riget on the TV,this was a box filled with chocolate candies filled with caramel.Even though,all those candies were taken with no finishing,I was still a child with wide open mouth.And then 'dogville'came.Another big different candy.
Be warned though, definitely an acquired taste.
My daughter is 18months old and LOVES Elmo, her grandfather got this movie for her and she already knows how to play it on the DVD player(she pulls it out of the case, opens up the player and puts it in... sometimes upside down though ;) )and sits down with the remote.
It does seem a little confusing though towards the end, but overall I give it sadly a 10 out of 10.
Notice how neither Guy nor Vera - the main characters - ever fully manage to reach this state of total cynicism even though they both try.
Moved into the picture, as though right alongside the characters, the action, the sound and the fury (of the war in Bosnia.)
Even though it's impossible for a movie to come close to the real horrors that took place in that land, as in so many other lands, it makes one think about the enormous scale of man's inhumanity to man throughout history.
I remember disliking it first time I saw it because I`d written an unproduced screenplay set during the Balkans conflict called SOLITUDE which plays out totally different from SAVIOR even though my screenplay also involves western mercs and also having a subtext that there`s no good guys in the Bosnian conflict .
Even though not masterly, it is at the very least competently made.
This can be disturbing, though it is not as bleak as the second one.
The game is a bit short though, and the way it picked up with the sorceress of time alive as she died on the only play through I did in Warrior Within.
The shake was the only decent special effects they even had in it so they just HAD to show it again even though the completely ignored that it doesn't make sense.
Worse still though is the behaviour of the police.
It should be said though that there are some positive things.
The female FBI agent gets hold of Astin's time machine device (which looks like a hand-held clear plastic cellphone/compass), realizes its power, and then..even though she knows there's going to be a takeover bank robbery in seconds, proceeds to... arrest Sean Astin??
and end up crashing the van even though they are not being chased!
They survive a tumbling crash without a single broken bone, even though they weren't wearing their seat belts.
seriously though there should be a agency or watchdog kind of thing, that prevents movies as bad as this being allowed to be sold / distributed to the public.
That's not to say that it doesn't have a serious side to it though.
Unusually for an action film you do care about the characters, especially Stuart, even though they themselves seem to care little about the carnage around them, and want them to survive.
The script is slightly better paced but at points in the film relegates Duane and Belial to mere cameos, I must confess I did like the ending though, quite a cool sequence to end on.
Each resident takes on their own personality and even though they later turn murderous the viewer finds themselves not only sympathizing with Duane, his brother and the rest of the freaks, but you will actually find yourself rooting them on as they seek revenge against several reporters from a sleazy tabloid who threaten to expose the Bradleys as well as a sleazy old man who runs a 'freak show' and falsely claims to have captured Belail.
The original "Basket Case" is one of my top favorite 80s cult films ever - just a bizarre idea that is strengthened by a great grimy New York city look and "feel", as well as awesome gore - and "part 2", though it was made about 8 years after it's predecessor, picks up right after the "dramatic" plummet from the Hotel Broslin.
Chances are, though, if you were not into the original "Basket Case" you surely won't like this sequel and you're probably not a Frank Hennenlotter fan in general...
Martin is persuaded by his ex-wife to take Jay back to Madrid though he is leery of having to once again assume the responsibilities of fatherhood.
Hache apparently is resigned to being a nuisance for his parents, but he wants to escape this situation by living alone, even though he's not ready yet.
The role of young MartÃ­n (Hache), perfect and tender Juan Diego Botto, as the real survivor of the script, turning sour into sweetness, and insecurity into strenght, even though he's lost in hesitations, is a message of faith in life.
i had seen this film when first released in early 85. though the pacing is slow and deliberate i find myself hypnotically fastened to the visuals aided by a good john lurie score.
though i find it an ambiguous film in that the character of christine's awakening of alternative sexual desires seems to leave her more frustrated than fulfilled.
could someone please inform me though if that British accented woman at the bar is an uncredited gina birch of The Raincoats??
My crew and I have over the years, made 12 films shown all over New York State and Connecticut(though now I live in Florida--near Disney World where the real aliens live and work, LOL)
Don't expect great things from the cast though.
The film's air of calm scrutiny is generally engrossing though, as it sketches the quiet disappointments and compromises of rural small business; a life caught up by routine, where years go by without a vacation.
In more ways than one (direction, cinematography, the script) the film gives a woman's perspective of the story, though a wee bit sombre.
I liked it also because even though the family cast may not be the best of actors and actresses, they put together a family type of feeling that makes it seem like they are a family, even though they are not.
I don't know what this director though he was getting into when he made this movie, but he did do a very good job in making a case to the completely uninformed.
I am not sure though that the conclusion of "Romeo and Juliet" is the proper one here: "They are all Punished", because in Romeo and Juliet's case there was no trial, and especially no jury trial.
Even though the filmmakers had an unmistakably obvious point of view, they did not succeed in persuading me to the same conclusion.
This documentary (though this one plays out like a terrific film) chronicles the trial of Michael Peterson, but at the same time tells you more about morality, prejudice, justice and Southern mentality than you could've imagined.
The director used a fly-on-the-wall approach to the subject, which was very appropriate in my opinion, though some people clearly regarded this as being biased.
I dÃ­d hear prosecutor Freda Black talk about the "filth" she found on Peterson's computer, talking about the homosexual pornography she found ("no relationship, but pure sex") and the triumphant look in the other prosecutor Jim Hardin's eyes (though he did his best not to show it) when he found the pornography.
A decent film that is head and shoulders above other Chaplin films of the time, though awfully crude when compared to his films just a few years later.
Though it loses momentum at times, the movie never loses my interest because of it's strong characters, great musical numbers, and its fanciful--though a bit unrealistic--depiction of this teen-drama-summer camp world that I barely knew existed.
(I keep thinking though that 7 is too low and 8 is just a little high.
The viewer may be left wondering about the ending, though.
Even though I have been only exposed to mostly decent films, this has to be one of the worst movies of all time.
Even though James Brolin, Harold Gould, and Jennifer Esposito obviously did their best with what was given to them, the movie as a whole just suffered.
You can't blame them for not trying though.
Notice that the previous reviewer, Rick Hancox, claims that there is a "strong message" though he neglects to mention what that may be.
So even though many of the images may seem random, everything from the toe to the lighting was very thought out.
That's okay though, I laughed, I said "Ewwww" out loud and at the end of the film I didn't feel ripped off.
Blood, gore and sadism all aroundÂ nicely done, though, and not too much.
My final score 4/10: Below Average: though I did like that they limited the CGI and that there was some decent gore here and there some of its own hokeyness and middle act bogged this one down enough for me not to recommend this one to the horror masses but the select few who can overlook its shortcomings.
Everyone else is dependable enough though it is a shame that we get the usual "dumb victim behaviour" from some characters who should have really known better.
Even though on the DVD there's not a lot of special features for the film but otherwise the film itself was a great gore fest that keeps you wanting to watch it and besides there's great actors and characters in the film.
The gore special effects are more than adequate, though the werewolf transformation sequences leave something to be desired.
I had some fun times with this film, even though it does not come close to any of the great werewolf pictures.
Also, the ending could have been somewhat better, though it is still perfectly reasonable.
Tension, shock and screams make a story chilling, and though this movie has its fair share of goopy-gore, it does not dominate the movie.
Even though it's not got an original bone in its hairy body you'll laugh so much you'll forgive it that.
But with "Twin Dragons," it appears as though the story did indeed destroy the movie, to the point where even the action scenes couldn't salvage the film from its inherent ennui.
Die-hard Jackie Chan fans may enjoy a couple of scenes, which display a little wit as to how to incorporate Chan's natural charm into the eccentricity of the situations, and some of the stunts are somewhat impressing, though nowhere near the caliber of some of those that he has performed in the latter half of the '90s.
Of course, even though the group unwisely mock the locals, they don't quite deserve what happens to them once they begin their hunting trip proper.
The most 'innovative' part of this game are the portals, and even though Valve's Portal-mod does a far much better job at this today then Prey, it is a cool effect (at least for sight).
Instead, it's the design that matters, even though Prey boils down to another corridor crawl when all's said and done.
They're nice, atmospheric corridors, though, thus rarely repetitive, and Prey also avoids Doom 3's problematic love of dark spaces, something it references in one of several humorous moments.
Some of the content may be a bit "politically incorrect" in this post 9/11 society: Robin's actions at the carnival were triggered by what happened in Israel, even though these guys had nothing to do with what happened.
What helps though is the casting, as Kirk Douglas in hero mode works best through this very narrowly focused man on a mission; John Cassavetes in one of his very best acting roles as the cold- though devil-friendly- antagonist as he kidnaps his 'gifted' son.
Peter isn't really killed (though his son is made to believe so) and he both takes some vengeance on almost being killed by wounding his former friend, and tries to reunite with his son.
i enjoyed this Brian De Palma paranormal thriller/horror.it.may seem tame by today's standards,but back then,i'm sure it was probably pretty terrifying to some people.i thought it was also revolutionary.there are some pretty graphic images that i found a bit disturbing,even though i've seen a lot of horror/thrillers.but this is not just some slice'n dicer.there's a story in here,and the gory parts are part of the story.John Farris wrote the screenplay adapted from his novel.and he has quite a few excellent novels that in the right hands would make good films.
There is one sequence that inspired a few unintentional laughs though, the bit where Gillian breaks out of the Paragon Institute is played out in slow motion without any sound effects only some really awful & inappropriate music, it feels like it goes on forever.
What's really annoying though is that Ch4 did their usual balls up with the show.
The whole cast is amazing, though.
Sometimes the funny gets dumb though and this movie should be taken about as seriously as the 3 stooges.
When it all comes down to it though, no amount of words can really describe what Darkplace is like, it's a show you have to experience first hand.
This is one of my favorite Jackie Chan movies, even though it's so light and fluffy it seems ready to just float off into thin air at any moment.
The Soldier and the Girl had several great, very funny scenes interacting with each other, and the comedy of the movie, though hard to place in a somewhat depressing war movie, actually worked very well.
The music was great (though certain songs were hardly used, namely my favorite, "Somebody's Eyes"), and is alone worth watching it for.
It's got a place in movie history even for the title song alone, though, so I decided I couldn't live with myself unless I gave it a chance.
This film really sparked my interest and even though I did not agree with some choices that were made in the end, I really liked this movie.
Graheam really shows her worth as an actor in this film - though I loved her in Boogie Nights and Swingers as well.
The acting `queen' here though is Heather Graham.
Essentially, the production team is the same as the previous film, though Gil Melle provides a jazz-orientated score instead of Quincy Jone's adequate but inappropriate themes.
Most importantly, though, is Don Medford as the well above average director.
With no star names to support him, such as Rod Steiger or Martin Landau (though Raul Julia did become a star later in life), Sidney stands way above his peers.
The racial motif is again absent, though a rival black cop played by Bernie Hamilton gives off a frisson of resentment.
Reiner is pretty inept here as usual, though.
The ending really sucked though.
It's no "City Hunter," but this is a pretty goofy flick...It's just good fun though, and even if you think twin movies are bad---THIS IS JACKIE CHAN!!!
Let's not forget to mention the ending though, it's worth the price of admission alone, with some of the coolest and most dangerous stunts I've ever seen!
All in all though most of the jokes were stupid and fell flat and the movie just tried to gross you out for the sake of grossing you out.
Still though, was better than part one, but it wasn't good enough to make me want to see part three.
But even though wr/dir Richard Benner was apparently far more interested in this theme than in the gay scene, and even though Benner seriously does not know how to point a camera, this actually does end up giving a pretty good time capsule of Toronto's 70s gay scene - and not just the hairstyles!
G2 has a pretty good idea (albeit though original one) with Daniel Bernhardt as a Macedonian warrior who is reincarnated 200 years later to do battle with a sinister Mongolian clan led by James Hong.
A little longer than it should be, but it doesn't drag, and the situation is a hook even though contrived.
She didn't run away to New York though, but if she did I would have chased her down like Max did.
The film, though, with all it's might, tries to make us believe that, yes, they can still maintain a loving relationship despite all the certain trials that lie ahead.
But the story is good though, so give it a try.
A girl can dream though!
The result is an effective (though often superficial) contest of psychological one upsmanship between Harry (Adrien Brody) and our heroine police detective, Madeline (Maura Tierney).
It used to scare the crap outta me when I was young, and even though its not that scary now I still love it.
There is a somewhat good amount of gore and violence, and the creatures look great for a low-budget flick, even though they do sound a little bit like elephants when they scream.
Altman DOES show us that TV can be fascinating and uplifting, even though he got curtailed, which will keep us wondering how that 12th episode that was never shot would be like.
='( Tyra Banks proves to be a very lovable character, and even though she seems clueless at the beginning, at the end she is the one who learns it all and finally understands to be yourself, to love yourself, to remember those things important, and to live life to the fullest!!
i was pleasantly surprised though as i really enjoyed the film.
i didn't really like the end though as i thought it would have been much better if she hadn't gone back to Sunnyvale but had stayed and married Casey's dad.
Even though it seems that the script- writers couldn't really decide were to go: More fairy-tale or more real-life.
Little niggles like that do not take away anything from the enjoyment of this rather charming movie though.
Lohan's character is a young girl who is still stricken by the sudden death of her mother, if though it happened many years ago.
The movie was impressively shot and presented, and I came away at least impressed with Jakes' acting ability (though perhaps that sort of ability is requisite for his line of work).
(I didn't end up in prison though).
I am glad to see that it has been edited as the original dragged on just a bit though it did have good flow.
corinna looks hot in it, but i honestly am mad at myself for buying this off of amazon, even though i only spent $1.
I had never seen Carmen Miranda in action, though I had long known of her being a performer with kooky hats.
The sea is rough (which partly explains why the murderer rows back to face execution: when every oar stroke is an effort, AND it looks to him as though he's doing the cowardly thing, the effort becomes unbearable).
Every section of the island not actively occupied by civilisation feels as though it doesn't belong to civilisation - even though it's so desolate it doesn't belong to anything else, either.
The murderer feels as though he's living under a just sentence of death and does what he can to redeem himself.
I'm not entirely sure a motion picture though full of violence or threats of violence would be fully understood by an American audience.
The sexual tension between Madame and Neel, though enacted subtly, is nevertheless palpable.
I give this very entertaining horror 8/10, it's pretty rare movie to find though!
The film paints a very emotional Asoka that Shah Rukh Khan excelled in bringing out, especially when three women in his life played an important part in his life-changing decisions, such as his mom's involvement for him to see the outside world, Kaurwaki in being his first true, and unattainable love that he yearns and pines for, and his eventual wife Devi (Hrishitaa Bhatt), a Buddhist who would be instrumental in his embracing of the religion after coming to his senses in the aftermath of his most brutal war waged just because of his insatiable appetite for more territory, though of course done in the name of uniting India.
Nasty piece of equipment that, though Kareena herself do have set action sequences dedicated to her and showed she's no pushover too.
I feel that this interpretation for the screen would also suffice, though stopping short at what Asoka is more renowned for, the propagation of Buddhist teachings across asia, and his emblem, the Chakra, emblazoned on the Indian flag of today.
That sucks because this movie was so good, but that flaw always interferes whenever I see the movie (even though the movie states it is not a true story).
It functions well, though, during the fight scenes.
It is strange, though, with its lack of any nudity or sex, which are all suggested but never shown, that the film received an R rating.
A pity though that it wasn't explored further, and had to be ended as it did in the film.
As London to Brighton begins, two hysterical young girls hide in a public toilet in London's Victoria Station in the middle of the night The younger girl, possibly only 11 or 12, her face smeared with lipstick and bruises, cries copious tears while the older, chubbier girl tries to comfort her though her own face is a mass of welts and black and blue marks.
One scene I found particularly shocking sees Kelly, Joanne and Derek in a greasy spoons cafÃ©; Joanne is awkwardly smoking and acting tough though it is clear she is out of her depth.
I feel these are not overdone (though they had the potential) because of the clever lines also sprinkled in between scenes.
Abbas-Mustan after BAAZIGAR came back with SRK in BAAZIGAR which was planned after BAAZIGAR  The film is a remake of NICK OF TIME, RUSH HOUR  The movie does disappoint you compared to BAAZIGAR and is too cheesy and stupid in parts  The all detective agency office changing into a hospital.etc is too stupid The film has some funny moments but things are too lose at start  The twist in the tale where the confusion about BAADSHAH occurs it makes you interested The scenes in the plane and then the entire chain of events are well handled The film does have many convenient situations too But they are some funny moments too which make you laugh and also keeps you thrilled at times  Climax is too filmy and a complete copy of RUSH HOUR  Abbas-Mustan is good, but not at their best Music is good, title song rocks and also Mohabbat ho Gayi  Shahrukh Khan fits his role well though he overdoes it many times yet his comedy is well directed here and his pokerfaced comedy suits him most but he does make too childish and clownish expressions which irritate Twinkle Khanna is nothing great Amrish Puri is laughable for wrong reasons mostly especially wen he says OH BACHCHI Rakhee is okay Sachin Khedekar is alright in a small role Johny Lever makes you laugh like in most AM films and he is a laugh riot Deepak Tijori is okay Deepshika is average Sharat Saxena is funny Razzak Khan and Saurabh Shukla overact Prem Chopra is hardly there Neeraj Vohra is good
Deepak Tjori was good as he should have been the lead villain though Deepshika was completely out of place and deserves better roles.
Main To Hoon Pagal was okay though being a catchy song.
The only thing with the print recently shown by TCM looks as though the film was re-dubbed as the dialog doesn't match the lip movements of the actors in the film.
Even though this might have worked better on stage, it's still far too stiff and and insignificant to make the audience relate to the characters on an emotional level.
however has a bleached out look, Using very hard light on the faces of the characters, I guess the idea was to enlarge their mental status by making them look more tormented, not very interesting to look at though.
just finished watching "The Man"with Samuel.L Jackson and Eugene Levy.not a bad offering.it's sort of in the vein of "48 hours".now i'm not equating the 2 movies with each other,though i do seem to recall being less than impressed with "48 hours.i did however find "the Man" entertaining from beginning to end,from both a dramatic viewpoint and a comedic one.the 2 stars are both very gifted actors,so it was good to see them in action.admittedly,the film was kind of light in tone(it could have had been a bit more substantial) and very short in its running time.however,for what it was,it worked very well.i do have one small complaint dough and that is that the movie did seem a bit mean spirited in the beginning.not sure why that would bother me,since i would usually not complain about something like that.
Even though it puts her career in jeopardy, Marsha remarries Pete.
The Elf mage was interesting but underused, the female barbarian was there solely for eye candy (though she did a pretty good job with her lacking part), and the cleric was there because someone apparently thought clerics were useless.
I was interested in the plot, even though it did tend to drag on at times, mostly the beginning.
There was something missing, though I'm not quite sure what it was, and there were also some things that didn't quite mesh.
Overall it matches D&D very well though, and a fan would have to be very picky for it to matter.
My favorite scene though is one of the closing scenes, where you see the wizardess and the rogue cleaning up the temple of Obad-Hai after receiving major healing there - a really nice gamers' touch I thought.
I watched it last night even though it has not been released yet (it plays on the Sci Fi channel on Oct 8th) and well... it was great!
Even though it was obviously lower budget than say... Battlestar Galactica.
The cast is by no means A-list, or even B-list; though they do well in their respective roles.
Less character development than in some commercials, even though this is a fairly long movie.
But I chalk that up also to the inexperience of the screen writers (though also is relatively common in D&D games, so perhaps is a feature, not a bug).
The character's are more interesting, the perils they face are more dire, the antagonists are clever and deceitful (which is rare in any genre), and their is definitely some decent, though not great, acting.
I saw it recently amongst friends (we were having a contest as to who could rent the worst movie) and it felt really dated, even though it wasn't made THAT long ago.
I though it was visually stirring.
I thought this segment was very well shot, though you had to really sit through the film to be rewarded for a segment toward the finale.
Even though the Hungarians are losing the war, they can beat the enemy in other ways.
IvÃ¡n FenyÃ¶; is no surprise, he's been in the Jake Gyllenhal movie Jarhead before (which I didn't like though), and he can act.
He's enjoyable here, not his best and not the best in the movie though.
I liked the character so much thanks her playing that the loss of her was one of the saddest moments for me though it was almost obvious what has to happen to her.
Lilyan Tashman is the standout here, even though she has only a small role as Russian vamp Vera.
It's a forgotten or perhaps not known very well Eastwood gem, not a dirty harry shoot em up though, a more dark, personal film involving Clints life orientating between father to his girls and his seedy sexual desires in the night of New Orleans, to his non stop crusade to bring a dark and mysterious stalker to justice.
This latter one, in all actuality, isn't even the story with more interest, even though that's the one most fans of Eastwood and of serial killer movies will want to see.
That nonchalance is rarely expected nor found in a serial killer, though he may become so used to his deeds that follow a strict scenario that he may become easy-going about it.
It's by no means certain these two will get together in the end though they both spark some interest in each other.
In Tightrope the accent is on suspense more than action, though when the action comes it explodes.
Cinematography was well-arranged and its skewed and gliding angles went in hand-to-hand with the ill-natured style, though there was a lot shots focusing on the characters shoes.
Overall though, this is an underrated film in the Eastwood canon and worthy of your attention.
I am devastated that this film didn't do better because I would have loved to see a sequel even though it never would have matched this one.
After an hour the film shows that the monks, though they lead daily lives that are silent and isolated except for chapel services, do also get together on Sundays for a communal meal followed by a walk and a chat, rain or shine.
Off-putting and tight-lipped though this film is, it will no doubt stand as one of the more distinctive of recent documentaries.
Bare and spare and strict though it is, La Grande Chartreuse is in some sense the most spectacular of grand hotels.
My other friend was also a DD and even though we didn't get the same "feeling" from it as our drunken friends, we did really enjoy the music and watching some people get sick and in a few cases pee on themselves.
The direction isn't terrible (though there are some edits that are), but the screenplay is truly abysmal.
Both the director and the writing team have some experience under their respective belts (though the rÃ©sumÃ©s don't contain any films of particular note), so they all should have been better than this.
In honesty, though, I feel even worse for those movie-goers who, either intentionally and with high hopes or by default, end up enduring this film.
The language does get rough in places, though, so if you find that objectionable you've another good reason to skip The Man and hold out for what we can hope is a better week for movies next week.
I give this movie 3 stars for one reason alone--the music was exceptional, though why they included Journey's "Open Arms" along with all the harder rock, I'll never know.
Apparently the different segments were the work of different animation teams, though none were particularly good.
I always liked different though and remember how refreshing I found this show and its stars.
The fact remains though it didn't end the way it should.
This cartoon (though I haven't seen it in years) presents a peek into the imaginary high-living, cosmopolitan lifestyle of the well-to-do in the 1930's.
Their married life was not very successful, was it because of Indira's father's political ambitions (that Feroze a respected and righteous politicians interfered with) or because of some personal reasons is hard to guess, though several speculations do exist (especially from pro RSS historians who use any means to tarnish the name of the politically influential Gandhi family), and Feroze & Indira started living separately.
Gulzar's recent movies have been very politically opinionated but Aandhi even though it is set in a political setting is not much about about politics itself.
While in BUCK PRIVATES their roles are thankfully bigger, they still are in supporting roles--though the studio stuck their names at the top of the credits to capitalize on their success in the last film.
And though there's no Frankie and Annette here, this one DOES have Ruth Buzzi, Lyle Waggoner (as "Chief Boyardie" - excuse me, just got up off the floor from laughing so hard), Terry Kiser (years before dying on the beach in "Weekend at Bernie's") and Carol Wayne, Johnny Carson's Tea Time Movie Lady (ROWWWRRR!).
Ustinov being one of my favorite Poirot's over the years, I rank this movie at least equal with the Murder On The Orient Express, though I think more money and time were wrongly dedicated to MotOE.
The cast went through hell though--it was very hot and the clothes they wore were heavy and uncomfortable.
As usual though they changed a lot of stuff in the movie which I hate.
Those are all relatively small issues I had with though, and on the flip side it's got a lot more positive things going for it.
Even though I know what is going to happen, the humor does not miss to bring laughter.
But that's not a bad thing, and it's a credit to Brest the writer that he has managed to make his film fairly easy to comprehend, even though there's an awful lot going on.
Set pieces though are gloriously handled, and the helicopter sequence is quite as good as anything in a Bond movie -- a genre that has managed quite well without spraying profanities everywhere because it knows, and we know, none of it's real.
The story and 'visuals', though not fantastic, was I think good enough to hold the shortest of attention spans.
Yes, Jamie Lee looks lovely (though she'd go on to look much better -- and much healthier -- in subsequent films), and it's fun to grin along with Travolta and the Tent in His Shorts in that entirely-too-long "hot aerobics moves" sequence..
Laraine Newman and Marilu Henner are gym groupies with no self-esteem, (Marilu gets the Chippendale man though, so it's all good).
Jann Wenner deserves special mention even though he's probably playing himself considering he was then the editor and now owner of Rolling Stone Magazine.
This is an important period in the Danish - and Scandinavian - history (with the 2nd Worl War; the occupation of Denmark) and even though I'm not Danish I really enjoy learning more about Denmarks national and local history in this way as well.
Even though she has an attitude, is arrogant and acts a bit too wise for a girl her age, she remains absolutely fascinating throughout the film.
Even though I found this movie to be a little off I still found it to be pretty interesting and not bad to watch just once.
It quickly picks back up though, and the final 15 minutes will have you inches from your TV.
I mean, I'm no fruit or nothing, but if I was, in a hypothetical, completely hypothetical-type situation, I would certainly be giving Irene a run for her money, not that I would though 'cause I ain't no fruit.
It makes this a rather fun movie to watch, though I wouldn't call it Leo McCarey's finest movie but that says something more about his qualities than that of this actual movie.
It has a fun typical 1930's genre story and the movie can be seen as a screwball comedy, though its not the best genre example of it, since the movie besides its screwball elements also feature many other, more subtle, comedy styles.
It sort is too bad though that the actors obviously had to improvise at times.
It was the only Oscar the movie won as well but it was nominated in 5 more categories though, including best picture of the year.
It has puzzled me though that the more I read the subtitles in the DVD and hear the dialog I am convinced the two characters were each having extramarital affairs.
Even though PENNY SERENADE (also starring the pair) was pretty depressing, it was also a quality film.
This movie doesn't have a terribly complicated plot--a man and woman are divorcing even though down deep they are still in love.
Even though 'The Awful Truth' may have established a formula for all subsequent screwball comedies, let's face it, it's still rude and crude around the edges.
Those of us who could watch West German TV, though, had a chance to enjoy the Frank Cannon series, if we could live with the fact that he spoke German.
The solution is unpredictable, even though it is based on the kind of double-deception that Christie has used quite a few other times in her stories.
Yes, you can spot the "ending" from a mile away - though of course half the fun in these realist films is predicting what might come next - but if there's one reason to see it, it's Kris McQuade (you might know her from the FIELDS OF FIRE trilogy) as the taxi driver: unmissable.
No Kim-Bassinger- siren nor Mickey Rourke bravado with sweat dripping off the main characters as though they were screwing for the Olympics.
Forrest Whitaker took the highlight for me though; he always steals the screen in a movie and doesn't fail here.
I also though the two less Hollywood actors Edgar Ramirez and Said Taghmaoui did great job in portraying their characters and were stern on screen.
Seeing it over and over is not annoying, though, again, those who might prefer a less engaging story might think it is.
I can't disregard the work completely, though, because this cast is amazing.
Even though we know what's coming- which is routine throughout the film- it's still a very effective start.
Even though everything is always not what it seems, and everyone is always looking at same thing and seeing something different we know where the film is going, but it drags in getting there.
Even though I personally thought that some of the characters were paper thin, many of the actors gave strong performances that made the characters believable.
Instead he's playing Uncle Creepy to a young blonde girl, who apparently has no friends or family even though she lives in a charming house with perfectly blooming flowers.
It is worth one's time to watch these masters of the art at work, even though the vehicle is so shabby.
Sadly missing, though, is a highly compelling storyline, but in this case style over substance is not such a bad thing.
She does slip out of it each time very quickly, though.
Both leads are good, though frankly this is a movie which they don't really have to do much besides act cute.
Even though it rated "R" it has a pleanty of nudity almost make a "NC-17".
Even though the character development are not as established as hoped, this movie comes off as a pleasant surprise.
Even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life, the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible.
GREEN FISH is an accomplished debut that fits well with recent Korean cinema, though it is a little too conservative to be classed in the higher ranks.
Good for a first film though, and Lee Chang-Dong is definitely a director to keep an eye out for.
The first part was really the one which had it in it and think they though that people will see this one because of it.
The trailer did look a tad on the positive side though but that, is how trailers are designed.
The presence of real actors such as Robert Englund and Adam Baldwin here is a little surprising- okay, they're not hugely respected actors or stars and generally appear in B-movies but I would have though they were both above soft core porn like this.
Helena Mattsson did not quite seem right for the part of Miranda,it was as though she was an understudy for Nicole Kidman with the soft voice and all associated gentle movements until it was time to be ugly, however I enjoyed it anyway for what it was,a good B grade Saturday afternoon entertainment movie.
Even though this is seemingly a more serious film than Shaolin Soccer, it still has the playful humor that made it such a fun movie.
But it is obvious that they had no idea how to market it, though they spent a lot of money trying.
What I will say is that even though I read a couple of good reviews about this movie, I wasn't prepared for what a wonderful experience sitting through this movie would give me.
Being a complete sourpuss when it comes to most comedic film offerings from the last three decades (though I attribute a lot of that to inanity rather than taking full credit for being a wet blanket), I find that when there is a film that makes me laugh so hard that I am concerned about the possibility of a stroke, I have no choice but to rave about it.
For instance, the romance between Sing and the mute girl was just kind of thrown in, though some of it was necessary for background on his character.
I was entertained throughout and even though I was dead tired when I saw it in the theater, it held my interest all the way to the end.
Oh well, even though I signed on to be in a quaint little comedy I wound up being in a schlocky horror movie.
Son, the oldest, basically raised them, and their lives are pretty lousy, though seemingly normal for the setting, rural Arkansas.
It was so telling how the older sons had names that weren't even really names, merely descriptions, while the younger sons had actual names as though they were the true human beings.
Even though Elizabeth Bainbridge was a very dignified Dame Carruthers, her character was perhaps meant to be a bit more of a gorgon.
I still have some hopes from "Sarkar" though which opens on July 4th here in the USA.
A slightly inferior companion piece to the stunningly brilliant "Porky in Wackyland", the first two minutes of this cartoon are fairly standard (though good) Warner Bros pre-WW II animation fare.
(She doesn't dance, though.)
The film shows a train hi-jack of the gold , though not sure if that happened, but huge quantities of gold did disappear post-war Germany and was never found.
Even though history teaches you the answer to that question, the film keeps you riveted to the seat.
Most aren't great, though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, it's an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying.
Strange that they don't flesh out the other racers before the start though.
The film - though a bit slow at times - was a unique blend of a Western and a 1001 Arabian Nights.
The confrontation will be terrible and he'll face off imposing winds,locust plague, quicksands... though he'll love to Arab princess(Zuleikha Robinson),a Sheik's daughter(Omar Shariff)too.
It is a story beautifully told and carefully crafted, though not without mistakes.
He seems to be the perfect heir to those actors specializing in adventure movies just like Harrison Ford, though Mortensen's characters (Hidalgo, LOTR) usually are a little more darker than Ford's.
Unfortunately, none are very good, including this one, though a number of talented people were involved in each.
It seems as though some critic expect this film to be on the level of " A Beautiful Mind".
It's actually a pretty standard war movie, though the score is exciting and memorable, and the combat scenes, though dated now, are pretty well done, considering this movie was shot in 1953.
In the end both Wally and Andre even though they have different opinions on how man can find his way back to nature as well as recovering his long lost sense of reality.
I like ImagoDei's interpretation of the last lines, though I have this faint feeling I don't really understand what s/he's saying.
Streep is excellent in her cool blonde role, though it's not a great part; however, her monologue toward the end of the film is very compelling.
Scheider is just right as the psychiatrist, and Tandy is wonderful as his mother, though her role is too small.
What I think a lot of viewers are missing, though, is the strong characterizations of Wallace and Andre.
Music is used marvelously throughout the film (even though covers of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" -no, it's not Jeff Buckley's version, it's Lucky Jim- have been way overused in films lately, the words actually are meaningful in a climactic scene here).
Non-German speakers are otherwise at a real disadvantage both for having to tear your eyes away from the charismatic actors and because few of the lyrics are translated in the subtitles, though I presume one is translated because the nostalgic lyrics for a pastoral past gain ironic resonance when the threesome ends up in a soothing sylvan Tyrollean landscape.
It is refreshing to see a German political film where the context is Europe within capitalist globalism, though there are a couple of frissons of recall to the unavoidable past, as when the rich capitalist they debate comes very close to saying he's just following orders in how he's just followed the system.
I think he really was once a SDS member and a revolutionary himself, though naturally he played it up a bit to save his skin.
This is a film that musters some good suspense and adrenalin rushes at first, but starts losing them as the kidnapping wears on because it all begins to seem more about politics and the talk than about the action, though wondering how it's going to end is still what's going to keep you watching.
The jerky digital video comes with the territory, though it may some day become as dated as bell-bottoms.
The problem of social precariousness touches many young people today I think, though there are probably not so many around who'd also take 'revolutionary action' as the people in the film do.
***  The ending left me bewildered though.
Mrs. Hughes and Russell are good and even, though morally objectionable, likable leads.
As the film progresses, you will find yourself laughing one minute, crying the next (you WILL cry no matter how mature or old you are, so make sure you have tissues), the next moment tapping your foot along to the familiar Beatles tunes found throughout the movie (even though they're covers) and the next moment simply staring at the screen not believing your eyes and ears at how emotionally powerful a film can be.
The story is sort of a clichÃ©'d one and has been done before, though not as well.
And though I have a pounding head right now, I feel like I'm the luckiest dad in the world!  
Thay are students or factory workers and I have stayed in their in lousy shacks and 8 square rooms eating the street food, and though I am not used to it and cant say I enjoy it, for them it is NORMAL and I know they have been contempt with what they have.
I can forgive that, though.
Nice try, but this is just another inexperienced director who did nothing to back up the veracity of anything presented, though stories about prostitutes always sell don't they?
I felt as though this cover was staring at me, within me, beckoning me to pervade its depths and discover the secret it held within...I knew that whatever this movie was, I had to rent it.
You get more than two... let's call them species, even though it doesn't apply as well here as in a lot of other titles.
When we know the author of the original stories is white, the film shows perfectly well how the American society, after slavery and after Â up to the 1850s Â banning the Blacks from all training into reading and writing, from all speaking their original languages and even from all affiliation to any religion, rushes head first into over-Christianizing the Blacks with no cautious slowing down and with all calculated speeding up they could master after the Secession War, both south and north, though for different reasons.
But the real interest is the large presence of Negro spirituals in the film, one of the very first films entirely centered on Black music, though in 1936 we must not forget we are after Â and within Â the triumph of the radio that enabled Black music and jazz to find a wide audience, to embed its existence and force into the widest Black and white audience it had ever had, just as it enabled F. D. Roosevelt to dominate the political arena for twelve years or so.
The tragedy - once again - is that so many talented actors were prevented by the racism of the times to achieve the professional success of white performers who, though no more talented, became familiar and durable stars.
Still, the final scenes have an undeniable (though depressing) impact.
But, didn't Columbo plant some evidence though?
It's sort of funny though how Columbo behaves all the more clumsy in this foreign strange world for him.
It's a complete different atmosphere, that doesn't really seem suiting for a Columbo movie, even though most of this movie got filmed back in California.
I have watched my share of Looney Toons shows even though I was born in 1993, and I know enough to know, that these feminine characters only appear once in a great while on the Looney Toons.
As much as I could complain about the first film though I would have to say that at least it wasn't Freddy's Revenge, quite possibly the worst sequel in history.
What about the visuals though, any creepy dream scenes, or fancy killings?
The stories are very predictable though, and the dry wit and manic mayhem that made the original Looney Tunes cartoons so brilliant is missed here.
The acting is considerably good, even though the hero screams like a little girl and the heroine looks like Meryl Streep's younger sister.
But this can also be nothing but a tactic from Freddy to push Jesse into killing, to titillate him where it tickles and where Jesse does not really want to be tickled, though when Freddy forces Jesse away from his girlfriend at the very moment when he was getting excited enough to let himself slip into some sex can be seen as the revulsion of Freddy for that type of sex or as the fear of Jesse in front of that type of sex, which would lead to believing that Freddy managed to get back into existence through the homosexual desire of Jesse and at the same time his resistance to this sexual appeal.
Somehow, when viewed in the wee hours of the morning, though, it almost becomes watchable.
The circle does not seem complete though and you wait for something to happen.
Her character though has some quirky characteristics, which don't seem to blend in well.
Nagesh Kukunoor is a better director than actor (he's not a bad actor though).
I sure did not expect the climax, even though once it started unfolding, I started getting the whole thing.
So I don't know for sure if this is greatness or this is cheating that Kukunoor pulled the wool on my eyes, though I tend to think it's the latter.
Even though one can objectively see that the hatred depicted for him is because he is a rapist who could get away with the heinous crime, it could very easily be projected on to homosexuals in general.
Unfortunately even though there is plenty of air action, one is left flat with this film.
The real highlight though was the lack of CGI, this means we get to see a wide range of real US Navy aircraft.
But it gets tiresome after awhile, though it does remain quite visible, so you can fast-forward without fear of missing anything.
Anyway, the movie is enjoyable enough, the ending was so very disappointing though.
Even though it's not a terribly original premise, there are so many ways one can have fun with the idea, so many possibilities.
For some reason, though, he is likable.
Later though, he begins to bond with the kids and discovers, as does the kids, that he actually really does care about them because he doesn't want what happened to him to happen to them.
It's as though the screenwriter didn't sit down and rewrite quite thoroughly enough.
I'm thinking that most people can relate to at least one of the characters in the movie and even though it is similar to an after school special, it's so much better than that due to the acting of both Richard Pryor and Cicely Tyson.
The sexuality in the film is very real, even though it is fleeting.
The film takes a big misstep at the end, though.
As the story develops these people manage to realize that even though they cannot change the harshness of their life, relying on each other's empathy and love can make things easier.
We know how it's going to end (though I'm not going to give that away), and we know how the characters are going to act.
I really got the feeling that I got to know them better, even though their lives are sometimes completely different from mine.
...yeaaah, though funny as it was I began looking at the clock saying "phew... hurry up and finish."
at the 50 minute mark  It can in no way scare or shock, as the corpses in every case are obviously fake, and even though a legless 1 armed girl is sexually exploited and then snuffed, shes slutty, bitchy, and doesn't exist as a character but has the on screen presence of a self aware plot device.
The plot of "we're selling corpses to a dog food factory, and we now have to deal with a handful of dead cheerleaders and their coach, and the witness we clubbed to death" was pretty interesting, though the idea that any valable company could sustain itself on the mortuary of a small country town, or would find that a cheaper worthwhile means of acquiring meat, especially given the obvious legal and moral dilemmas, is absolutely moronic.
Living in the UK, though, it was near impossible to find, especially since the WHEELS OF TERROR Amazon.co.UK has is actually the 1987 film THE MISFIT BRIGADE, which they mistakenly claim is this film as MB had the alternate title WHEELS OF TERROR.
The rest of the cast are okay, though apart from Marcie Leeds as Stephanie, Laura's daughter, very few of them are on screen long enough to make much of an impact.
The young cast involving Leon Ford, Charlie Garber, Lenka Kripac and Alex Vaughan gave fair, but likable performances, though it was the punctuating performance of Steve Le Marquand as the very freaky Zippo that made real headway.
Nicely directed by Robert Wise, it deserves to be much better known and it's a shame that Warners couldn't find a place for it on their Val Lewton boxed set, though Editions Montparnasse's French DVD is an acceptable transfer.
Their recent retraction only illustrates how far this once influential monthly has fallen, though I'll admit I'm a subscriber.
Oates acting as GTO is spectacular, though the actors gave solid performances all around.
Even though "Easy Rider" came earlier and was much more successful, "Two Lane Blacktop" is a far superior film.
The problem is that even though they are free, they don't seem to realize it.
Cook is by far the funnier, more dedicated and original.his quick-witted thought processes are brilliant though i did sometimes wonder if he was simply trying to be as shocking as possible simply for the sake of it.
It does make you wonder what happens when you leave for the day, though.
I think that can be said of the whole Brody family though I enjoyed the scenes in the garden with the kid playing with the dog.
Cats and Dogs is more than puppets meet Muppets; it is more than that, even though just as entertaining, it has progressed to greater levels.
Besides, I'm still pretty young at heart even though I'm past 40 (not immature, mind you!
Even though there are a few stupid parts, overall I really like this movie.
It was a very good continuation of what I can understand, even though I've never seen the first one and this was my first time watching the second one.
Her acting is always excellent though the scripts are usually failing.
I really enjoy all three Halloweentown movies though the only thing missing from Halloween High was Marnie's friend Luke.
The cinematography is brilliant, the dialog, though typical of films of this genre, is tongue-in-check and thereby hilarious as well as highly entertaining.
Her acting is always excellent though the scripts are usually failing.
I think it is a really good movie, though the ending was a bit too short and too fast, I would have liked them to spin some more drama and emotions on the fact, that Hannah had the experience she had in regards to Aunt Eva.
It ranks as one of the cinema's finest duels and Flynn will always be remembered for it even though that amazing leap with the knife was performed by stuntman and B picture actor Jock Mahoney.
The Eskimo woman goes nuts and apparently kills another team member, though I was a little confused by this time.
Very sad in this respect, but a movie that needs to be seen, hopefully to get people thinking about their impact as a collective mass that everyone is having on this poor planet we call home, often to the detriment of all other forms of life which have suffered terribly in one way or another, and I think this is what was being shown in the film, and the spirit of the earth and it's misplaced creatures rising up conveyed this message very well, though not in such detail as to spoil the mysterious effect but in ghostly ways that were just right, not too little and not too much, but just enough to get the message home to what it was really all about.
Good job to the marketing team on getting all these positive reviews up here though!
I love The London Broil, though in the movie you never see them juggle on rolla-bollas!
Most aren't great, though because it contains THE MAN WITHOUT A HEAD, COPY SHOP, RABBIT and WASP, it's an amazing DVD for lovers of short films and well worth buying--it's just a shame about the captioning.
I believe though, that film (as part of mass-media) has tools to show everyone that it was so terrible, that it's not understandable for us.
Whoever plays Rupert in any stage production in any country, will always be a hit, event though the leading part is a double role.
But then, one would have needed to cast someone like Errol Flynn as Rupert, and, fun though he is in swashbucklers, I'm not sure that would have worked.
This is probably Ronald Coleman's best film, though he does have other terrific films to his credit.
John Cromwell's direction sparks this entry into " The Prisoner of Zenda" This film redone by MGM with James Mason as Black Michael and in colour( Color)  This version has more wit and sweep even though its in black and white.
Few today have even heard of Junior, though most movie buffs have heard of his father silent star Douglas Fairbanks and step mother for a time Mary Pickford.
He almost meets his match, though, in Douglas Fairbanks Jr., here playing a charming & completely ruthless young villain.
He has, though, been in some good movies.
Monica has had it with him and leaves him for good and even though he doesn't want her to leave there isn't anything he can say to change her mind.
Glenda Jackson starred in a film called "Stevie" in the 1970's and she had to carry that film herself also and even though I thought she succeeded this is a task that's practically impossible even for the best actors.
Obviously he/she who prefers "the more sordid and the more violent (and therefore supposedly the more realistic - though that's a question for debate ) the better" will be disappointed.
Of course, each and every one of us would react differently to this situation, but the film on that level at least seems highly plausible though obviously no one really knows what the experience would be like.
Unlike mermaids though, Selkies are either all human or all seal, depending on their mood.
the other one is great though.
I'm a die hard Madonna fan...I mean literally obsessed so i've seen, heard, and read just about everything shes ever done unfortunately i wasn't able to view this film when it originally premiered because of work but thankfully i caught a late night showing of it last night on VH1 hopefully they plan on showing it again cause i'm definitely looking forward to repeat viewings...now i have to say cause its only natural that people will be comparing this movie to "Truth Or Dare" after all they do share some similarities...like they're both documentaries for a Madonna tour..oops sorry but thats where the similarities end...the person Madonna has become is nothing like the person from TOD not that she was a bad person the but her life has changed so much...she's finally experienced some success with her acting (Evita)..she's finally won Grammys(something that should have happened long ago)...shes discovered a newfound spirituality...which i think has a lot to do with the changes i observed...but most of all and most importantly the biggest difference now is that shes a mother...and wife...2 roles that i know lot of people thought she'd never play...but she is and with great success..after almost 5 years of marriage her and Guy act more like close friends than husband and wife and it is truly beautiful to see her interact with her children...even though we don't get to see too much...but i think what was most touching was seeing how more open she is about her emotions and how much kinder she is and ultimately how much happier she is...i thought this movie was beautifully done hell i think the cinematography is award worthy...and there were a couple scenes when she was talking about peace that made me get a little choked up...particularly at the end when she went to Isreal to give a speech about that very subject...well i have to say the biggest difference between the 2 films is that TOD is for fans only...IGTTYAS is one anyone can enjoy or at least learn something from whether fan or not so check your local listings and when it comes out on DVD don't just buy a copy for yourself but for everyone you know
Madonna has proved that age simply made her get better,and that even though she may be under the radar sometimes, she is still very relevant.
They are all in some sort of group together, a team of some kind, though I'm not sure what exactly and they need a place to train for the summer, as they do every year.
It occurred to me a day after I watched this movie that I had seen a film by Nobuhiko Obayashi before, the campy kaleidoscopic "Sada"(a true story about a woman who castrated her lover and became an overnight celebrity in WW2), and though that is a mere hint of the full on onslaught of this movie, it makes me want to see more.
No shadow should fall on the actors though - they're all top of the line.
A Horror-fan and avid lover of Japanese cinema, especially from the 70s, I had high expectations for this film, and I was not disappointed, even though the film was totally different than what I had expected.
Even though director Nobuhiko Obayashi maintains the ambiance of a fantasy/fairy-tale movie, the imagery he uses is often bizarrely nightmarish and grim, with decapitated heads in wells and tap-dancing skeletons and whatnot.
And what really bothers me is that in the post-screening discussion... even though no one could accurately explain or make sense of what they just watched... even though half the audience was making fun of it the entire time... even though it was an absolute goofy mess, NOT ONE PERSON SAID IT WAS BAD.
I like some of the editing, even though it is crazy.
I liked seeing the various cars competing and even though the movie is a bit predictable, and sometimes the actors' lines seem cheesy, it is an enjoyable movie for a gearhead, a racing fan, or just someone who likes cars.
Not a serial in the strict sense, no kids in the lead, no swordplay between mythical creatures or giant robots, no mutated dinosaurs, definitely nothing marketable (perhaps the Tachikoma, but I doubt Stateside), and unquestionably something you won't catch broadcast Stateside anywhere near prime time, though I sometimes think Stateside networks aim for that, whether the viewing public likes it or notÂ  Mystery writers would call GITS:SAC "a police procedural," and science fiction writers would probably add "cyberpunk" to that label.
Two predecessor GITS movies to rent, each radically different from the other (one dubbed into competent English, the other subtitled) though essentially featuring the same characters.
The new intro is not great though.
Even though I've seen series with a bit more 'driving' plots (these series being certain seasons of X-files, Millennium and Buffy the Vampire Slayer), the overarching polt is just amazing.
I must say though I enjoy the series, however the plot is a little confusing and complex but upon repeated viewings I appreciated it even more.
Its forgivable since this is a problem with pretty much all animation barring a very few but since it looks as though the producers are putting so much attention to detail, they should'nt have really overlooked that feature.
The characters draw some of the aspects familiar in the movie... Motoko's commitment to her job, Batou's casual-tough guy attitude, etc... though it adds some surprisingly refreshing characters like the blue child-like mini tanks Section 9 rides around in so much.
Overall I highly recommend this series to all fans, though hope they watch the movies as well.
Even though the ending is predictable, I didn't care.
EASY is not a "chick flick" (though women will definitely identify with the main character) and is not your standard Hollywood romantic comedy.
Beware though, you might want to adjust your lenses for episode 12!
i've seen them all Live in Melbourne, didn;t see the original Pirates though saw the one they did for the Anniversary in January 2003 i got to Meet Jon English, Gerry Connolly, David Gould, Sheila Bradley& Carmell Parentel and they signed my Program Guide i meet them at the Stage Door :) they were extremely nice and happy to sign the Program for e i meet the Conductor Kevin Hocking after the Hms Penifor and he signed the hms book for me i loved what he did to Jon English in Pirates made him do a song about 4 times ;)   i like the Singletts their so good :)   i wrote to Simon Gallaher and he sent me a signed Photo :)  has anyone seen the one with Anthony Warlow i just saw it on Abc TV in Australia
Minor points, though, you could hear the audience absolutely loving it and it kept far enough on the traditional side of the line without being stuffy - Gilbert may have shuffled uncomfortably in his grave but he would not, I think, have turned right over.
They all looked as though they were having a great time hamming it up wonderfully!
She looks like a 10-year-old in 'When the Foeman Bares His Steel' though!
One thing I will say though, given that the reader of this review might be knowledgeable in the typecasting of all these faces, don't think you've identified the culprit by that.
I know it's not one of the great comedies of the century, but I laughed out loud several times, even though I was watching alone.
The made for TV "Topper Returns" actually deals with Cosmo Topper Jr. and though OK is nowhere near the caliber of this "Topper Returns."
I though Derrick de Marney at times performance of Uncle Silas was not creepy enough, as it verged towards being comical.
Eklavya transports you to the vivid land of Rajasthan, where the Local Rana (Boman Irani, splendid) still considers himself the king even though democracy prevails.
It is sad though, that all of it does not add up to something better.
Little rugged tip though.
I have one problem with the film though.
The pace is breathless, as though generations of past injustices can wait no longer for expiation.
I though it was a western and I find instead a strange community making whisky clandestinely at Ozark Mountains Region, Arkansas,who remind me some people I meet in a trip to North of England, near Kyle of Lochals, very reluctant to contact with foreigns.
Also on hand are Beulah Bondi, Ward Bond, Marc Lawrence, who gives an amazing performance, and Harry Carey, whose pleasantness and plainness I find tiring, though I suppose he's well-cast.
The supporting cast aren't bad, either, though this is really Madsen's show.
The character of the Candyman was so scary, not just because he killed people (though that had a lot to do with it), but because the person he was chasing was not believed (and actually framed for his murders).
The music in this film is one of the most memorable things about it though.
Even though there's hope found within the story, it's extremely gloomy and finds a few moments to get down n' nasty with its violence.
this is the second filmed version of Richard Matheson's novel,I am Legend,the first being The Last Man on Earth,starring Vincent price,and the third bearing the same title as the novel and,starring Will Smith.i really enjoyed the first version,and pretty much hated the third version.this version is,much closer to the third version,in terms of my opinion of it.i found a lot of this movie lame,lacking in any real excitement.the acting was pretty poor(though Heston wasn't too bad).i also felt the movie was a bit too talky at times,and there is no real air of mystery to the story.having said that,there was one good thing about it.this one had a plot,(as slow as it was)which i felt the third one didn't.it was just this side of boring,for the most part,occasionally slipping over into the area of boredom.i was able to get through it.but i wouldn't care if i never saw it again.it just really didn't anything for me.my vote for The Omega Man is a 3/10
They did save a bundle though filming in just two rooms, and clothing the monster in a $40 outfit.
The guy who plays the monster in human form is cute, though, but not cute enough to save this stinker.
"Tekkon Kinkreet" is a sporadically engaging, though frequently confusing, anime gangster film from director Michael Arias.
Enjoyable film, though more like a play, examining relationships between two married couples.
The story is Matsumoto's, and is interesting and charming though perhaps not fantastically original.
Character designs are fabulous and original, though their animated versions remind me Belleville Rendez-Vous (The Triplets of Belleville in the US), released three years previously.
What is impressive though, is that despite the unravelling of each person's flaws, we don't despise the characters.
The film is also echoed by Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast, though it is certainly a lighter hearted affair.
Overall though, the film is a disappointing show.
Indeed the entire rape issue in the novel was totally played down in the film (MGM brass could not bring up the idea of rape with Flynn, even though he had won the 1944 case brought against him on that charge).
Soames isn't the only Forsyte in whom Irene has an interest - she loves the paintings done by Jolyon Forsyte (Pidgeon), though she learns quickly that he is the family outcast, not even permitted to see his daughter, June (Leigh).
I feel as though I missed the climax of somethings.
The physical characteristics of Wolfe's entire world in a brownstone appear here to be spot on, as though the producers were preparing it for the famously particular sleuth himself.
Archie seems very much to enjoy manipulating the hapless participants in the mystery, as though escorting guests out the door before they are ready is wicked fun.
Even though I could have chosen to disbelieve, it never happened.
The supporting characters are pretty well done - even though some of them are a bit wacky.
The whole question about how and why the room came to be and who the Occupant was before whatever happened happened was just left to float away as though no one would really care anyway.
For a detective, he barely asked any questions and I feel as though it was intentional so we would forget that there was a mystery to begin with.
But once the last hour came, it was as though the studio sent down a memo telling the director to wrap it up so they could start filming a reality TV show on the sets.
Eye-watering Japanimation might not have all the spit-shined polish afforded a Miyazaki production, though any excuse offered from the same studio that provided many eclectic animated thrills with the Animatrix compilation could only be explained by admiring their unabashed passion for detail.
Although I'll admit that even though I was worried that this would be the case, it didn't bother me all that much, because the story had good forward propulsion and a resolution that was emotionally satisfying although not intellectually so.
I highly recommend watching this if it comes on again, though make sure you start with Part One!
It's a good family film which I oddly enjoyed (even though it's certainly not my style of film).
I saw this movie as I had seen a good review from IMDb itself....moreover I was compelled to see this film as Dakota Fanning was in this movie........even though Kurt Russell was in this movie..........I expected it to be her movie and it was..........She is an amazing talent whom we had seen in I am sam,Hide and seek,war of the worlds,push,winged creatures............without much effort she delivers the beautiful performances and it makes me wonder..............The story has inspired me and has made me realise that to achieve anything we must believe.............even when odds are against us..............this film brings out true value of relationship and will to uphold the most thing in which you believe.................
As with other "truth-based" films, I came away curious to know more, even though I suspect much of it is far-fetched.
As he knows many Japanese old downtowns and landscapes, his way of constructing the imaginary town is so real though many Asian tastes are added, and I believe the town in the film must attract Americans too.
I was pleasantly surprised though.
As written by Luc Besson and as played by Anne Parillaud , Nikita is a whiney, drug addicted psychopath who murders a police officer in cold blood, even though she has virtually no chance of escape.
Dakota Fanning has held her own against "father-figure" heavyweights like Robert De Niro, Denzel Washington, and Tom Cruise, though many would have pointed out that she had rivaled Naomi Watts for the 2005 Scream Queen honors with her performance in War of the Worlds.
Even though this movie had a leading actress her performance was not good so I give this movie 4 weasel stars.
Of all the movies about cross country road races (Cannonball 1 and 2, Gumball Rally, et all) I always thought this was easily the best, even though you tend to hear about it the least.
The difference, though, is that while Cannonball is often funny with some great action, Cannonball Run is often too over-the-top and unwatchable.
I guess teaming up is the right word even though Mifune has actually sworn to kill Bronson if he doesn't work with him.
You could call it an experiment and it's an interesting blend, even though the story seems familiar, it does keep to its strengths and never wanders off onto pointless sub-plots.
Bronson fans (like me) will note this is the second of his 'samurai connection'westerns...Magnificent Seven being the first...though the debate will probably never be resolved as to which was the better performance.
Joe isn't the worst thing about this flick(it's the funniest thing, though).
Full Moon though would rather make a movie featuring characters from different movies coming together.
I figured out most of the story even though I don't speak much Spanish.
The heritage of all the episodes is pure vaudeville, and though I'm not that old, don't forget that vaudeville entertained people for many more years than our modern TV era.
It has some controversial material, though it is all executed with superb and poetic class.
Even though he still has one close and supportive friend, Harry slowly becomes a bitter, introvert and pessimistic person.
He does manage to get a dance with the girl of his dreams though, by wrapping his face in toilet paper.
Even though he still has one close friend who supports him as much as he can, Harry slowly becomes a bitter, introvert and pessimistic person.
It's amazing, though not surprising, how Citti can keep your attention up without ever leaving the casotto..
You follow a few parallel stories from a fixed point of view, sort of similar to Scola's "La cena", but kind of lighter, even though I wouldn't call this a comedy.
I just saw it again tonight, though I remember seeing it a couple times when I was a kid--and even back then I was amazed at Steve McGarrett's awesomeness.
The problem with it, though, is that again and again, you really need to suspend your sense of disbelief because so much of the story really is super-human and impossible to accept.
I actually liked this--even though reality be damned!
And, to make it even more amazing, he gets to romance sexy Nancy Kwan--though in one odd scene, he's on the beach with her at night necking...and he's wearing his usual black suit and necktie!
The main characters of Chin Ho, Kono, Danny and the Governor are all there--though Danny and the Governor are played by entirely different actors.
It looks as though he's going to break his guitar, burst into tears, have a stroke, or all of the above at any second.
Still haven't been able to find the soundtrack though...
Even though the movie contains some great fighting scenes, they seemed to me more like a symbols, a way for Izo to scream is rage and is rebellion against humanity.
IZO then comes back to life (though years later in the movie) and starts killing everyone.
This confuses me -- though I definitely didn't grasp everything upon the first viewing of this, I was still instantly amazed at what Miike has set up here: A journey through one man's tortured soul.
We have Izo, who is consumed with rage, slowly turning into a demon as he kills (what appears to be a Japanese oni, though my grasp of Japanese mythology is limited).
It's fun, lightweight (even though it gets heavy for the characters) entertainment and a decent entering place into the world of Corean dramas.
Just like JFK, though a bit more fun, innocent, and less obnoxious.
Basically, though, the film is junk.
Thats about it though.
It's interesting though that it sheds light on the Mormon doctrine, rites and such, as well as the inner church bureaucracy.It is a very good effort, starting a bit shy, not saying anything about the religious aspect, then less and less shy until it really becomes very enlightening on these matters.This is not my first Mormon film, I saw another one, more interesting, "The princess and the Marine", about an Arabian princess being saved by a Mormon GI-Joe from her native country.I liked it very much.
".As proof of this, that I don't have anything against the Mormon religion,I'd have to say that I saw Salingrad (even though the film's made by "zie Germans" about "zie Germans", fuhrer and Nazi stuff mentioned in there, Sven Hassle style) and absolutely loved it, and I gave you another example with another Mormon film I really enjoyed in the last paragraph.So don't throw any rocks at me please.Just because I didn't like this movie doesn't mean that I don't like Mormons...I just don't like this film.
Alicia Silverstone is very hot, though the title of this strange looking thing really sucks.
Alicia is beautiful and Benicio is handsome in this light romantic-comedy, though all the car trunk scenes will make you look at your watch.
Even though I was born and raised here in the US, I have been exposed to my Polynesian roots and love and embrace both cultures of who I am (Polynesian side and American side).
The female lead never loses her shirt even though everyone else ends up with torn clothes.
The most annoying thing though was the cannibal tribe.
Miraculously, though they all say the same thing all the time, they all understand each other.
If you can sit through it, even though I don't even recommend putting it in the player, feel free to experience the most boring 90 minutes or so of your life, and hate yourself for never being able to have them back.
It was pretty funny most of the time, though it was all pretty obvious, but that's all right.
Even though I thought it should have been way way way better, I will give it a 10/10.
It is still alotta fun though.
Unfortunately, his dream woman has the habit of growing a tail and gills whenever she gets wet, though in Hanks's world, this isn't necessarily a deal breaker.
One thing for certain though, I adore Splash!
Some of the story seems a bit out there though and at times the movie gets a bit to sappy and the ending kind of did not make any sense.
Overall though I thought it was rather good.
The resulting script is not all that good though.
It's a life of immortality but from which he can never, ever escape (though he doesn't yet know it whilst he's submitting to her therapy).
The movie is a classic and, though, some people maybe skeptical of a 10 of 10 rating I think it deserves nothing less.
Turturro's particularly good in it as the best friend, yet her character is left out of the final half hour, though she's a central character, and never returned to.
Unfortunately though - not unlike many pros at their profession - being so young , being so popular , feeling so "untouchable" - there is always a downside.... Gator's fame and fortune quickly caught up to him.
it may have been the influence for it though as the "helicopter jockey" plays a small part in this film.
Having just watched it again though...
The relax performances are adequate even though the characters are pretty much vacant shells, since most of the effort went into the look and thick atmosphere.
For the most part, they try to keep people out of the town, which has a very small population, but their twisted fetishes necessitate the occasional admission of outsiders, though in an unusual, involuntary manner.
I don't understand, seems as though today everybody hates serbs, but through all this time we are still here...thats why our people have a saying "Samo Sloga Srbina Spasava" which translates - "Only Faith Saves Serbs"
It is funny though to see him as a father and a grandfather when one is so used to seeing him as a bachelor, like in "La Dolce Vita".
Don't expect to come out with a smile after this one, even though it is an interesting experience.
Mark and Michael Polish DO deliver halfway decent performances - though I'd rather have seen Michael in the lead.
My heart sank when ignorant folks would stare or respond to the twins as though they didn't already know they were different than the rest of the world.
Quite a few people die, though usually off-camera and unrealistically, and "Orville Ketchum" lives up to his reputation as one of the funnier and more-difficult-to-kill B-movie actors.
When I was really young, even though I saw the caricatures of Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre and Edward G. Robinson - plus the scenes from "The Jazz Singer" and "It Happened One Night" - I couldn't interpret anything from them, but of course now I can.
Parents, don't hesitate to watch it with your kids, though.
For even though it is not a fancy movie and may not be put on a list of the 100 best movies of all time ( even though it'll go on mine)It is a heartfelt and a heart warming movie till the end.
Seeing Robin Williams in a robotic role such as this,gave a point of view on the world even though he did not realize it in the first place.
Andrew's romance with Portia was also touching and believable though I did not think about this while the movie ran.
Even though I can admit that "Bicentennial Man" contains several flawed motives, I still was a little surprised that the film opened to many negative reviews.
AS for the character of Andrew(Robin Williams), though he is supposed to be a robot you really connect with his character and sense his growth over time.
All though Silverstone put up a half decent performance, Benicio Del Toro didn't get his role together, and stood out like a sore thumb.
Obviously too much time has gone by for a sequel to be made now, though I can picture one that begins right as Nikita ends.
Nikita may not be perfect, though the material in the beginning and the end is so strong that only middle section prevents it from being a perfect movie.
Tanya Roberts did a good job as Julie, though, and had a really nice sense of humor.
CompaÃ±eros has some of the makings of a classic: a promising (though unoriginal) premise, a fantastic bad guy played by Jack Palance, a stunning supporting actress, and an excellent score by Enio Morricone.
I think Corbucci was vastly underrated because he happened to make movies in the same vicinity as Leone who seemed more likely to pick and choose from various American westerns (even though he's been orally serviced by too many people, I still do like his stuff) whereas Sergio Deuce pounded out some westerns that I think truly compete with the best of Mr. Leone.
The pacing could use some work and there wasn't enough nudity (ok, I'm joking on the last one...could have used more nudity though)  Where was I?
In the end the you know what hits the fan with Bob, even though he's dying from an incurable and unnamed illness, getting elected governor of the state.
All in all, though, I found this to be a fine film, well worth seeing.
Benicio del Toro's performance was all right, even though (or: because) he seemed to think he was in a remake to the 'Usual Suspects'.
The gloves take away a lot of the blow, so no cats got harmed during the making of this motion picture and actually seeing cats fight on the streets with their claws is of course something far more violent and violent looking, even though it's just nature, unlike obviously putting gloves on a couple of cats and let them fight in a small boxing ring.
I am an ex-teacher who always had a good relationship with the kids I taught (though not as authoritarian as the Miss Dove of the title.
It is a very dated movie and the performances, though honest and direct, are not Oscar-winning.
The town's generations, all taught by this remarkable woman, react; some come from far away or start stopping by the hospital for news; and this leads to a flashback of how her life's course was changed by her father's money problems and the desertion of her by her erstwhile suitor; how she then vowed to pay back every cent of her father's debt, though she was not personally responsible; and how she began teaching school and has gone on doing so.
The picture displays thriller,tension, twists plots and is quite entertaining , though some moments is slow moving.
Awesome cinematography by Page who reflects splendidly the Paris streets, though mostly made in studios.
He's at least twice as good as Keanu Reeves, though admittedly that's not saying much, and is absolutely adorable in the role of the shy, blushing ingÃ©nue.
To be fair, though, he is attractive, and pleasing to watch during the sex scenes.
The two leads are very good actors and even though it has a somewhat unbelievable ending, I liked it.
She is, though, endowed with facial features that are uniformly sinister: a firm, wide jaw; a tall thin forehead; and two glowering eyes that seem sunk deeply into their shadowy orbital sockets.
The movie is nicely shot and some of the Brooklyn scenes look as though they actually could have come from a 1940s movie.
It seems that if he does connect to someone on a deeper level, he's afraid he might kill again--though he is clearly a decent person who snapped one time in his life and only after being pushed.
Having more 'rounded' characters with less rough edges DID make it easier for me to become 'emotionally involved', though.
It's certainly interesting to speculate on what motivated the changes in his later work, though... !
For all of the heart wrenching scenes in this movie, you never once feel as though Streep is going over-the-top.
Basically, there are only three females in the movie and even though Christine (deaf girl) occupies quite a lot of screen time, she is just a filler.
If the stoic personality of the main character, though forgettable and one dimensional, can manage to make sense, all other characters in the film verge from bizarreness to insanity.
I mean he gets Howard, a weaker man to go along with his ruthless scheme even though it is quite obvious that he really doesn't want to.
It doesn't sink in, though.
Even though few are really quite as devilish as Chad is, many who have a certain amount of power and income behave that way.
The real victim here, though, IMHO, is basic human decency.
It is violent, though nothing u wouldn't have already seen watching The Devils Rejects, which beats this movie by very far.
Laura Ramsey plays the "final girl" Jenny, and though she is nice, as per usual in many horror movies (horror is one of several genres that are merged in this film), she is rather bland.
Sanoe Lake makes her first on screen appearance since "Blue Crush", though one might wonder why she bothered, as she gets nothing to do.
They handled the Reality-TV show aspect quite well actually, and even though it was rather straight-forward, it was still good.
Luckily though, God of Gamblers succeeds in this aspect as well.
Overall though, God Of Gamblers is a quite tasty hongkong-movie that every fan should see.
Andy Lau also gives a very note-worthy performance, as Chow Yun Fats sidekick (even though this is a much younger Andy Lau).
Beware, though: this is not family viewing with the high amount of profanity.
Vigilante thriller its not, like the synopsis reads and the front of the video case might suggest with the imageryÂ though the scene does occur.
She is effective though her part is brief.
Even though the woman portraited are, of course, living in North America it is still a fabulous documentary, actually quite breathtaking in all its "naturalness".
Once the crew is on board, though, the movie switches gears completely, turning into a stupid 70s battle of the sexes, in a ridiculous set with garish lightning.
But then, it's as though the makers of the movie just totally ran out of script, money, and inspiration, and the flick completely dies; just marking time with inane dialog and absolutely no developments for what seems like an eternity.
It's such a distinguished cast and crew, and they look as though they felt they were part of something important--the dark, somber lighting, slow pacing, and portentous music suggest Paramount's "A Place in the Sun" from the year before.
Many of the reviewers appear to agree that this film as well as flagrant anti-Stalinism is bad, bad, bad, though they split a bit on the quality of the performances.
What could have been an interesting idea for a film just comes off as cheap propaganda in the end--though it could have had something to say had it been done better.
So bad, though, that it's absolutely sublime, sort of like a "Reefer Madness" of politics, with its stereotyped, one-dimensional characters and its glorification of authority figures.
Patriarch Dean Jagger is a schoolteacher, Legionnaire, pipe-smoker and beer-drinker (though when vexed switches to Bourbon).
Stubby Kaye wasn't so bad, though his character, "Marryin' Sam", became more irritating as time went on.
â back into uncouth but amenable country-folk) â though, once again, the dance sequences (choreographed by Michael Kidd) go on too long and cause the almost two-hour film to drag.
Incidentally, the loutish Earthquake McGoon is less of a grotesque this time around; Abnerâs parents, though, still look like they belong on another planet â also, Robert Strauss (very popular around this time) turns up under heavy (make that filthy) make-up as Daisy Maeâs opportunistic close relative, whereas Jerry Lewis does a very brief uncredited cameo as a dopey-looking character called Itchy McRabbit!
Lethargic comedy, previously filmed in 1929 with Norma Shearer, does have one plot twist, though many viewers may tire and tune out by the time it is revealed.
LOL Trouble with Hanna-Barbera, though, is once they had a good thing going, they didn't know when to stop.
From then on, though, it does seem like the cast is just reciting lines.
Valerie Bertinelli was amazing in this, though.
This was shown on channel 5 in england on 5/9/03 and channel 5 not normally being a very good channel i was going to skip this movie, even though it sounded quite 'interesting'.
I'd quite like to know what happened in the end though!
So it was appalling to me that even though there was no basis in law for granting custody to Jody Ann's appalling mother, simply because of a judge's personal bias custody was granted.
Just don't expect Bladerunner, though even that was deemed doomed in its day.
The music, though, leaves much to be desired.
Seems as though the old duchess married into the aristocracy and she spots that Crawford is not all she claims she is.
I am partial to these movies because I live in Wisconsin where deer hunting is part of our culture but this one is still a cute movie(I really wish we'd get a look at the hunters in these movies though!).
THE LAST OF MRS. CHEYNEY was not a very good film, though you probably wouldn't suspect that until the film was about half complete.
I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie, though not as good as the original is far surpassing many Disney sequels.
On the other side of the coin, The Great Prince looked gorgeous as did the other deer.......Friend Owl was drawn absolutely spot on, though Thumper and Flower did look nice they still did'nt look quite enough like their original incarnations to retain all their charms.
I doubt it's better, though.
It was as though three terriers were taking on an angry bear.
One noteworthy aspect of this film is that the producers listed the ships in the credits as though they were members of the cast.
When it came up against determined though still inferior-gunned adversaries, Langsdorff's response was to cut and run.
They are determined to kill the Graf Spee, even though they only have 6-inch and 8- inch guns.
Even though Juan Peron had not taken charge in Argentina, it was still friendlier to the Germans than Uruguay was.
The Bogman (if that's the right term) wasn't at all scary, though he might have been a good idea for a kids movie.
I didn't miss anything important, though at that point I wouldn't have cared if I had.
Bela Lugosi, so often underrated as a performer (even though he played none other than Jesus Christ on stage to some acclaim), manages, here, to convey a sense of loss that is almost palpable.
for whatever reason, pieces of the theme song are still clear in my head, even though i haven't seen this show since about 1981. being a huge simpsons fan, i delight in all of their pop culture references and this show was referenced close to a half dozen times.
To me, though I was not blown away by the movie, I still had a lot of reaction to it, ultimately that Sang-soo's elegantly broken storytelling reflects that our reminiscences can bring not much solace.
In my humble opinion though the film has about as much mystical atmosphere as a trip to McDonalds.
Trance, a vague, though good movie.
But you will feel as though you have seen truly great cinema.
This is an unusual horror movie that won't be to everyones' tastes, though I think it's probably more accessible than the same director's unusual vampire movie Nadja.
It also contains multiple shots (and even the continuity transitions are creative, including flames, as though the negative catches fire).
The Marines, however, *were* covered even though they were inside since they were carrying arms on duty, hence coming to attention as well as the salute.
This one has no hook, though, no monster or vampire, just some demented people.
While I watched it I thought I would give an 8, after finishing it I though it's a 9.
But it will in fact go down as one of my favorite episodes, even though it was so sad.
In one sense though Ladd's character is very much like Raven in This Gun for Hire.
The problem is that although Ladd is a hothead with a checkered past, he's too decent to keep up the ruse--though Keith is now angry enough to eat hornets because he was counting on this big payoff.
It's dangerous, though, as Keith AND the bandit who raised the boy aren't about to let Ladd take this guy back to his real parents.
Tom and his brother Mike are deeply loved by their Mother though the two are as different as night and day.
Even though the character has few if any redeeming features Cagney manages to make us care about what is happening to him.
The character that brings the most sparkle is definitely Cagney, though it took me some time to accommodate myself to him.
The performances of David Manners and Jacqueline Wells (aka Julie Bishop) though adequate, are dwarfed by those of the picture's two stars.
The final sequence though played off screen, is nonetheless terrifying.
The violence in this film is every bit as brutal as anything in a modern "gangsta" flick, even though some of it takes place off-camera.
There are no fist fights or scream contests in this movie (there is some of that near the end of the film, though); everything about the movie is hysterical, but strangely subdued.
In the film there are also some naiveness and clumsiness, though.
I do understand though that this film will raise a lot of controversy and have people not understand it or love or hate it.
Hatch was incredibly annoying as the treasure-mad professor, though it's hard to say who was the MOST annoying.
Apparently, it was just some kind of animal, not a mystical guardian, since all it took to kill it was standard weapons - though it did manage to die and come back.
Even though `Solange' upholds the mystery longer and more efficiently, this film contains a little more action.
What remains the same though is the classy visual style and the mystery aspect.
Though not especially gory the film still offers up a few grisly doozies, though the best moment effects wise (it involves someones hand) is best seen through adept use of the pause button to focus on the frame or two for which the full glory of the effect is seen.
I can only seriously give it a 7 though.
We're asked to believe that because Mike Wilding as Tye Graham can't "see" his hot blonde fellow musician (because he lost his sight in WWII), that he could never love her (even though she's younger, prettier, sweeter and a BILLION times better for him than "Jenny").
And to add an extra cherry on top of the sundae, we're asked to believe that even though he was a journalist, went to war, then came back blind, now he is suddenly a brilliant pianist who knows every note of every song Jenny is going to (lip-synch) sing, even though it's a new show with new songs that the public hasn't heard yet -- songs that he already has memorized (because Jenny's former MD, who could not STAND her, "teaches" Mike the songs).
Dated though the threat may seem, the movie still works well.
We are much wiser about computers nowadays though, and we grudgingly admit that trusting the red button is far better in the hands of men than machines if such things must be.
Even though we may not create a defense system in this way, it seems to predict a visage of something that is yet to come.
This underrated science fiction/suspense drama, though arguably dated in terms of technology, is still a frightening allegory about humans allowing our technological creations to rule us.
The set-up is a slow-grinder to begin with, though there are interesting ideas that pop up throughout the film.
I think even though the budget was low and the overall quality of the film was rather primitive by today's standards, the "feel" of the movie is what made such an impact on me and everyone else who has watched it!
Even though it's old and creaky, even though it's mannered and any violence happens discretely off-camera, THE BLACK CAT somehow has the power to make me feel uneasy.
Even though it has some weird stuff happening, like Lugosi telling his loyal servant to obey Karloff (does he REALLY switch sides, or is he only pretending as Lugosi told him too?)
Even though nowadays zombie movies aren't the most original things ever, this one is probably the best one out there.
Even though the film had a low budget, the effects were amazing.
Her character has changed while the girlfriend of Tom behaves very much like Barbara of the original, even though in the original the girlfriend acts totally different.
Whether or not the Barbara character was altered out of fear of being attacked by feminist groups, I don't know, but I do know that too many horror movies these days are about though, dominant female leads who survive the tragedy that befalls them while the men succumb to the tragedy.
I was wondering though how they would tie up the ending.
Even though I just managed to watch it the whole way through!!
This new version also is a full-blooded and genuine horror film with loads of tension (even though you mostly know what'll happen next, it's still scary), good acting (a lovely B-cast with names like Tony Todd, Tom Towles and Bill Moseley) and excellent make-up effects (although, it has to be said, the gore is a less outrageous than expected).
It's never really explained how she became such a crack shot though.
There are some cute visual and verbal references to the first film and the gore has been upped drastically (though not as much as it could have been).
Here, though, an annoying score sometimes takes the viewer out of the picture.
Even though it is extremely long (134 minutes), still you never notice the time passing.
O'Toole, in particular, thought it was a comedown to be directed by aging old-schooler Anatole Litvak, though Litvak does keep the Euro flavor consistent in this.
O'Toole and Speigel biographies talk of the actor deliberately overplaying the Tanz role so as to sabotage the mystery element of the picture, though it's hard to see how restraint would have improved the role.
gives the apparent offhandedness of the moral treatment of the material a contemporary edge, though.
It's hard to fault Litvak in this, though another director might have emphasized the passage of time as a dramatic-psychological element.
Even though it's supposed to be a surprise we get to know who the killer is just by his unsavory actions both on and off the battle field and with those he deals with, German as well as Poles and Russians.
Even though we in the audience already knew who the killer is well before he was discovered by both Maj. Grau and Insp.
In this story the makers could have better used the sighting of a glimp of a general's collar patch (these are typical for general's ranks, though the one of GeneralFeldmarschall differs, Rommel carried the wrong ones in this movie as well).
I wonder though why Harry Andrews wasn't credited?
I think you'll be refreshingly surprised at Lugosi playing the sympathetic character, even though it's not entirely clear early on in the movie.
She doesn't end up in jail though she is taken in by a government agency and given the choice of working for them or being killed.
She isn't totally free though, whenever the agency calls she must drop whatever she is doing and perform a mission.
And of course it has Omar Sharif as Grau, a genuinely admirable character, even though he's too reckless about his own safety (as in the last 1944 scene).
And even though some people say that Peter O'Toole is miscast, he really draws you completely into the Tanz character.
I don't understand, though, why Tanz wears the uniform of a Wermacht general through most of the film, then shows up at his last confrontation with Grau dressed as an SS officer.
The tanks used appear to be fairly good recreations of the Tiger tank (though not exact), which is refreshing after seeing so many modern American tanks pressed into service as German types by Hollywood.
But the including of the bomb-plot not only serves to tie together the storyline, but provides real excitement (even though we know it's going to fail).
Colonel) Grau, though I agree that maybe he could have gotten alittle more screen-time (in favor of the over-abundance of scenes with nerdy Tom Courtney!).
Obviously Inspector Morand couldn't do anything back in 1944 in Nazi-occupied France, so to have him solve all the murders (including Grau's) in "modern" times is a good final touch (though one may wonder why he waited so long to do it -- after all, the war had been over for 20 years...perhaps he had his suspicions of Tanz all along, but no proof, until the Hamburg murder.)
It's a very good portrait of the so called Belle Ãpoque, though Jean Renoir's priorities were always to show a creation, a fantasie.
I had worked out who the spy was, though I did that in the book straight off too, but it was well done, there are plenty of false trails to keep you guessing.
It's her love and devotion to him that ultimately undermine his plans, though the government was starting to get on to his forgery.
As for the plot, despite the facts that so much of the script is wrong, it still is a very captivating movie and at least it captures the essence of who Reavis was--even though the details are more than a little wrong.
Once the story proper begins, though, the pace is brisk (one is indeed surprised at one point to find that three years have elapsed in the course of one dissolve!
The story also shows how carefully Reavis planned his fraud though many years.Fuller was able to have as a cinematographer the great James Wong Howe, who wanted so much to shoot the picture that agreed to have a lower salary than usual.
Many of the characters add a great deal to the story itself,even though at times one gets the impression that some of them are there for continuity more than realism.HIGHLY recommended.
Price's conviction and Fuller's straightforward direction somehow make this preposterous tale ring true (many of the basics are correct, though Fuller certainly over-dramatizes the later confrontations between Reavis and the government with its allies the homesteaders that the Baron is trying to steal from).
Well well well Satish Kaushik is one of the funniest actors on Hindi screen at least in some films he was damn hilarious though he got annoying later-on  As a director he made social dramas like HUM AAPKE DIL MEIN REHTE HAI The recent hit TERE NAAM and some good films Comedy is considered one of his liabilities in his directed films be it HUM AAPKE DIL MEIN REHTE HAI and HAMARA DIL AAPKE PAAS HAI In TERE NAAM it was good but in this film he tries to make a complete comedy and ends up making a poor cousin of David DHAWAN films  The film starts quite well but suddenly becomes a sad caricatured over the top bullshit comedy  In short, Imagine a plot less film with comedy so forced and childish that it makes Govinda films classics?
I loved the special appearance by Gulshan Grover, him doing kind of a parody of his earlier "bad man"-character, though i'm not so sure if it was intentional or not.
not all is wasted though because if nothing more we learn from mr preminger that women wore hats back then to disguise the fact that they were beaten up pretty often.
The plotting lets this film down, as after a good opening half hour - the film descends into boredom as we try to discover who really was behind the killing, even though there only ever is one suspect.
I'm not so sure about self hypnosis though.
It's not a bad film though.
But  not bad, though one could write the film oneself.
Also, the plotting isn't too serious and Chan's wisecracks to his son seem almost mean-spirited, like Abbott & Costello like, though one can take them with a grain of salt.
It would be better if you saw it on the big screen though.
this film is hard to resist, I watch it like 24/7 it's an amazing even though the plot is thin, the animation and the cast were the best part of the film, this film is like greatest film ever because of how realistic it looks real including the meteor crash, even though if a remake was being made they had to thicken the plot a bit but still keep the magic this film holds and also add a bit more cast members because their were like only 10 real characters that actually spoke words when the rest were just roars and grunts, so adding more characters would be great, also when i watch this i forget the fact it's a Disney film because of the little amount violence and the fact there is no songs because that would make it quite a silly film so i'am glad that they put any songs on.
Also, the dialogue seems as though it was written by a 10 year old kid.
The result was almost bound for success, and though the movie is known now mostly as Bogart's breakthrough movie (his earlier films had him typecast as a second-string villain), it is really not Bogart who dominates it, but Howard.
Penniless, he seems almost trapped in a futile existence, though his brief visit to the Black Mesa Bar-B-Q will soon offer a grand moment of glory.
Gabby magically and quickly finds herself head over heels in love with Allan, finding him worldly and intelligent, though to him, intelligence is "brains without purpose".
Much of the dialogue is dated (though clever) and is written in the faux-Lost Generation style popular in Broadway plays of the twenties and thirties, which is to say there are hints of Fitzgerald and Hemingway in the attitudes expressed, but little of their artistry and originality.
I had just finished reading a long, thorough history of World War I when I saw this one and even though this is some twenty years after that awful catastrophe (all wars usually are, but this one especially), one can still feel it's aftershocks rolling through that desolate landscape.
Peter, the driver that picks Dina up in the beginning, states the theme through dialog even though the action in the past works as subtext to show us what the theme is.
Hate it, though, because Jeffrey Donovan definitely should get better uses of his skills than this wreck.
Also, this director has a great cast of actors and yet they still end up sucking (though I personally don't blame the actors, I blame the director).
Even though the order of several scenes change, or are altered a bit, and there are a few segments unique to the 1978 version, the editing on the later version is generally superior.
Anyway, Tell me something is a well done thriller that keeps you wondering (in difference to twelve monkey were I figuered out the end after five minutes of watching despite what people said what a surprise ending it was supposed to have - I would rate Twelve Monkeys with 1 out of ten anyway, though.
It's pretty easy to guess who the killer is, though there are some good red herrings that distract the viewer's attention.
If you are a fan of Seven or Silence of the Lambs, though, Tell Me Something comes recommended.
This is a nice easygoing film - the storyline is familiar to anyone who's acquainted with romantic comedies, though this film really isn't the comedic type, actually.
That scene does make up a little for the flaws I grumbled about earlier, though definitely not entirely.
And yet, at the end, there is no absolute clarity, even though the identity is obvious.
It feels as though the director has gorged himself on the full gamut of cinema, taking in not only his own cinema but glossy but predictable Hollywood and glorious, violent Japanese cinema.
In a way, it even tops both American movies, even though it's not really comparable to them, because the story goes in another direction as the movie proceeds.
2 hours later the mother is brutally dead & of coarse the young man is convicted & sent to prison for trial   all along he keeps sayin he had an alibi by a scientist doctor who gave him a lift by his car that particular night   but that witness was no where to be found & after a while the son was hanged the flash backs are over  back to reality where miss marple & the family of 5 children , their father & his fiancÃ©e ( miss marple's friend ) are happily spending the evening doing sharades & hanging around so Merrily  when a scientist doctor spots an old newspaper & reads that a young man was hanged due to killing his mom 2 years ago he comes in a rainy night to this family's night to reveal a dark secret   appearing like a ghost out of the windows where they all gathered & telling them that their long dead brother was with him around 8,30 which is the same time of the murder of their dead mother taking place , so there is no way he was the murderer & they all discover that if their dead brother isn't the one , so it's one of them  & the mystery goes on & on & gets more thrilling & full of surprises i love reading , i would support novels brought to movies , novels are harder than a 90 minutes screen adapted novel to some people ,though novels are more deep full of details & depth that no way a movie can deliver  but on the other hand a movie is easier to understand for young people, easier to watch especially for a whole new generation of Agatha Cristie's young fans  back to the movie ... i think it's done very well , miss Geraldine's acting is always awesome i love the way she does it .. the acting , her custom's ,the way she always repeat the word '' dear'' in many lines in the script makes u feel like she 's ur own granny lol  the casting of the family was wonderful & very suitable , the 2 sisters Kirsten & Hester are wonderful actors especially the younger one kirsten , she is a very sensible actress , the brothers jacko ( the thought to be murderer of his mother is wonderful ), the other brothers were so right in their own places , the lake where a suicide takes place was original ,the house & the stormy weather helped much in the belief of the realism   i don't think the movie is crap on the contrary i think if u r free for the weekend & it's on TV try catchin it or rent it if available , u'll enjoy
This is a great episode, fine the conclusion is nothing too amazing, even though I didn't guess it.
I find them new and fresh and proof that these stories, though based in a bygone era, can be reinterpreted in a newer age and with a bit more color.
I guess we are to just go by faith that she had some real breakdowns back in the day even though it is never seen or mentioned.
The first scenes at the parade are brilliant, though.
Anyways, this show is a complete waste of time, I don't like people who compare this show to the daily show, because that would be a huge insult to the Daily show and Jon Stewart, even though its obvious the stupid correspondents on pop cultured are trying to emulate the correspondents on the Daily Show, but they promptly fall flat on their face every time they try.
I have ordered all three of the books even though I have heard they are a hard read.
Anyhow, it one of my favorite movies and it made me laugh even though it is dated it is true to how people would react in that situation, I loved the ending also.
They should play it though every so often, I haven't seen it since that night.
Even though it is sooo cheesy and pop culture like, there is something real about it.
Sherilyn Fenn has one of the best roles of her career, even though it may not be much of a stretch (an actress playing an actress).
#1: In one scene Lazarus #1 or #2 you don't know which has a goatee that goes from thick to thin #2: The dilithium crystal assemblies fit into Lazarus's ship like they were designed for it #3: He falls off cliffs even though he is disoriented and off balance.
Still, though, not as bad as Spock's Brain.
The Alternative Factor though wins the honor as a bottom 5 episode while Court Martial doesn't reach those absolute lows based on some decent acting scenes.
3 of 10 even though it's Trek, it's a pain to watch and I won't be next time I see it on.
McCoy treats him for a head injury, and even though he is clearly unbalanced and dangerous, turns him loose to wander the ship and steal a couple of dilithium crystals.
Meanwhile, a man falls off a cliff, again and again, and is cured by a small plaster, though blood drips from his mouth.
The voice acting is generally bad, though Linus is pretty good.
Even just THINKING about that scene induces tears...  As a whole, though, the film is enjoyable fare.
There's enough fun though, as Woodstock's first appearance in the Peanuts series is well placed and delivered, with as many vaudevillian expressions as Snoopy.
One unresolved scene baffled me though and it involves Irfan's character discovering two girls kissing during a power failure.
If you translate the novel into a movie, though, you're dealing with a more limited medium and it's a lot harder to make multiple story lines work.
Turns out, a family of deranged in-breeders, residing in the deep backwoods of Minnesota, are kidnapping people and releasing them into the wild in order to hunt them for sport... With the use of some crafty lies, Dean manages to coax the cop into accompanying him to his brother's rescue, though not without difficulty... Like many horror fans, I have an appreciation for killer hill-billies and "The Benders" pulls off a pretty standard-style of the sub-genre, yet it is interesting to see these two dynamic characters involved in this particular setting.
So far, not the BEST episode in the series (my current favorites being "Asylum" and "Skin") though it is pretty much right up there with them.
Handsome, though."
This remains the most perfect film by which you can revisit (on screen) the truly joyous feel of sexual liberation in the mid-seventies, though steer away from its predecessor.
It's not like the concept of this movie is any less silly than that of the first movie but at least the first movie still somewhat worked out, since it was a fine, formulaic though fine, crafted simple piece of horror.
I rewatched it though and was surprised and how much better I liked it this time.
because even though Dean is tough he is no match against a possible 'demoniac Sam'.
Excellent use of him brining in a big secret though, and then dying before revealing it.
But it was still one of those heart wrenching moments which had me in tears (im a girl, its OK to cry at supernatural....saying that though i defy even a boy to not cry at that scene!).
We do find out some new information, though it remains to be seen exactly what will come of it.
Kajol looked great though.
Kajol looked amazingly gorgeous, the sets were amazing, i wouldn't pay for watching it on theaters though!
I though Aamir was very good also but just could not match her.
His acting is simply so natural and marvelous that no actor in Hollywood is comparable to him including the overstated SRK.. A must see though its does leave u slightly emotionally wrecked but kajol is looking very pretty too.
Aamir is splendid though i felt his character got a bit sketchy in the 2nd half not his fault the director and writer could have made his motives more clearer for us .
Aamir plays Rehan, though it's a unusual role that many of Bollywood actors would turn down(nobody wants to play the anti-hero anymore), he makes it real to the core,you follow him through the whole transition of his character,you love him and you hate him at the same time !Aamir is the master of acting today.
Even though Rehan (Aamir) did not derail from his cause (terorrism apparently) till the last breath in his body, he will draw sympathy from the viewers.
The first half of the movie could have been made better though.
Keep in mind before watching it though, that it's going to suck.
yes this movie had the same feel like the other shark films did, but thats what was partly so good about this film, i will add though that it did have a twist.
we watched this film because we had nothing to do else, though we knew that this film must be cruel.
but we didn't expect kind of barking sharks, wires falling down under water with the speed of falling on land, talking divers though used a normal mouthpiece instead of a full face mask.
Great sets, though.
2 of 10 - above a 1 only because I like Vanessa Angel, though not one of her better films.
Fanny became a much more human personality after watching this play/comedy/drama and I felt very sympathetic to her even though she was obviously an extremely difficult person to live with.
Some of the characters behave really really odd though, especially the detective guy.
There are a few cute food-related sight gags, but the short is a bit flatter and less energetic than you would expect, though, to be fair, if you look at it without comparing it to later work by Jones, it comes off looking a good deal better.
The ending is all rather predictable, though fun to watch for the most part.
This isn't a bad short, it just pales in comparison to the work which would come later, though it does make clear that Jones was interested in the cute and sentimental from the beginning.
Even though basically they end the same, there is an underlined sense of repentance in this movie's end that is completely absent from movie themes today.
The film packs action western, riders pursuits,emotion,shoot outs and is quite entertained .Besides contains good feeling as the friendship,faithfulness and companionship although was betrayed for one of them on the final.The trio young players is phenomenal,they will get much success in the future,especially Ron Howard(American Graffiti) with a successful career as director(Beautiful mind,Cinderella man,Da Vinci Code);Charles Martin Smith as famed secondary(Starman,Untouchables);Gary Grimes(Summer of 42,Class of 44) as starring of Westerns with similar role of naive cowboy(Cahill US Marshal,CulpepperCattle) though nowadays he is retreated.And, of course, the great Lee Marvin ,he makes a terrific acting.
The story of a ranch foreman who has to hang his best friend Steve for stealing cattle under Trampas and the schoolmarm Molly who loves him is still a compelling story to tell for the early talkie era though it might seem old-fashioned today.
With the end though, it was nice to see everyone happy but making the whole villagers look gay (happy) is so unrealistic.
Madhuri Dixit's comeback movie, though bit loose in script and the story-line, sums up the importance of arts in our life beautifully.
The difference here is that Madhuri, the lead actor, doesn't end up with a romance at the end (though we get the future possibility).
Joan Fontaine and Joseph Cotten who are presumed to be passengers on a ill-fated flight and, though listed as among the dead, are actually alive.
Divine has probably been discussed enough though I think she remains sadly underrated as an actress but what stands out for me in Maniacs is David Lochary's performance.
To us though this was worth it.
It was heart-warming to see just how much he cared for V, even though he knew what she did for a living.
she's quite good in the role though.
The story is simple (though it does take Dad a little too long to figure out what this girl does for a living)and the environmental subplot is underdeveloped, but the movie is filled with believable characters and funny scenes, including one very funny scene where the boy uses the hooker as a visual aide for a school project on the female anatomy.
Even though it is more a light-hearted comedy the teenaged stars are given a realistic treatment throughout the film which is something rarely see in film.
My main problem though?
This is very much like an Indian remake of "Autumn in New York", though, and despite knowing this I was not prepared for the conclusion.
Get a nice warm blanket and a box of tissues ready though.
No wonder so many people think Kal Ho Naa Ho is directed by Karan Johar himself though in reality KJ only scripts and produces , his former assistant Nikhil Advani is actually at the helm .
She acts like a pro , though over-expressive in a few scenes .
Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's music is not high on melody yet the title track and "Pretty Woman" are very hummable though I didn't dig "It's The Time To Disco" .
Even though I loved his previous films (Kuch Kuch Hota Hai & Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham), Kal Ho Naa Ho is definitely my favorite.
The best part of this movie, though, is its theme.
Well, it is always a bit difficult in Western countries to get to see Bollywood movies with English subtitles, and though I have made a bit of an effort to spot them in the last few years I wouldn't call myself a Bollywood expert - and of course I've grown up with Western rather than Indian aesthetic standards ingrained.
I didn't find it at all "bashing" or disrespectful; on the contrary, as a scientific documentary it is quite dispassionate, though there are some personal stories and struggles interwoven through it.
Super-glossy image, decent acting (though I find Sobieski pretty boring as a lead) and a good, minimalist music score can't do much when the clumsy screenplay has so many conveniences (the heroine seems to have a mysterious knack for being in the right place at the right time to see/hear/find everything she needs to piece the truth together).
To get back to my point though, to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year, no less, is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers.
I predicted how the ending would play out (and i was right) even though I did not want it to.
I feel this movie will not reach people like it should though... People and Middle America will pass it off and just play it up as Hollywood hype and just really not want to acknowledge what is happening in the real world...
i enjoyed this movie.it has suspense,action,drama,and decent acting.it has a pretty dark tone to it,which i liked.while it have the same high octane adrenaline rush of "Joy Ride" which also starred Leelee Sobieski and also came out the same year,it's still pretty good in its own right.there's more of a slow build up to tension in this movie.i also think this movie demands a bit mote of its actors,especially for the the quiet dramatic moments.the cast acquit themselves fairly well here.the movie is fairly well written,though not wholly original(but there are some original elements to it)for me "The Glass House" is an 8/10
Apparently, though, it is too subtle for many viewers.
Of what, though?
Everything was tastefully done and well though out that I am ashamed it didn't do as well as it did.
At least this had an interesting story, but as befalls so many films in this mind-bending sci-fi genre (and "The Matrix" suffers from this as well, though it's a far better movie), the writers have set up such a cerebral concept that the movie grinds to a halt when it has to trudge through all the exposition just so that the audience can keep track of what's going on.
His vocal work, though not sure if it's his voice or an imitation, is superb.
Even though I found the very ending to be a bit week (though passable) and tangentially inconsistent with the visceral flow and power of the film as a whole, I heartily recommend "Dark City" to all those who thrive on a challenge to the imagination and have the courage to question the darkness in a quest for the light.
For all of those who have been misguided and praised The Matrix as the greatest scifi movie(though i rather call it junk), you have been lied too.
This one does have clean cinematography though, with okay acts by Rufus Sewell, Kiefer Stherland, William Hurt, Jennifer Connelly.
Rufus Sewell gives a good performance as John Murdoch, though i could'nt help feeling he was holding back somewhat.
Never mind that, though.
There is very little profanity in this movie but it's still an ugly, sordid story and not always fun to watch even though it keeps your attention and - at least with me - draws you back for multiple viewings.
The philosophical under pinnings though, (of blue pills, red pills, the subreality of consciousness and all that mambo jambo etc), so successfully popularised by The Matrix, was infact neither originated by The Matrix nor as fully realised than in other more accomplished works.
The movie seems to run a little long in places and there are a couple of pointless plot points (the whole Dean Stockwell character), overall though and mainly it is a cool action movie in the same vein as Die Hard or other movies where you have the one free guy making trouble for the bad guys.
I guess I do have a couple of complaints, though.
But in several scenes, even though I know what's going to happen I jump every time!
There is nothing special, but for a film from 1997, this has good effects even though there are few.
I have it on good authority that Air Force One does have countermeasures, but putting the president in an escape pod Â though fundamental to the plot Â it just inane.
A little time alone with her seems to change his mind, though, and he risks his life to give her back to the Navy when it seems they might be trying to fly away without her.
(The director apparently lost interest in Carter at the end, though; when the helo runs out of gas and crashes beside the ship, only very careful viewing lets you see him make it into the lifeboat, and he's not seen for the remainder of the movie.)
I don't think it's a tarsier, though Mahoney the expert calls it such.
Jock Mahoney is the commanding officer Harold (though I could have sworn he was called "Alan" here) who tries to keep everything together.
It helps, though, for it is like - What is this, urban Bengal?
Odd (though wonderful) sensation, I must admit, to be the one being riffed.
Well acted, actually funny where it's supposed to be funny, sexy and suspenseful with an ending that isn't telegraphed from the beginning (though admittedly not nearly on par with the shock endings of such films as "Jason Goes To Hell - The Final Friday" or the shocks all throughout "Jian Gui" (aka "The Eye").
And, though it does play by the rules (unforutnately), there is something about it that makes it more entertaining than the recent dismal fare (not that Pacific Heights wasn't highly entertaining).
I always found it a shame, though, that humorous stand-up comics like Hackett and Don Rickles played so many stupid roles in these '60s films.
It's safe to say that Indiana Jones has nothing to worry about just yet, though RJ does display an annoying knack for not dying despite the endless opportunity for the baddies to shoot him, which was often.
When the Indian that R.J. was jailed with supposedly confesses to the murder R.J. believes he was framed, and when the Indian is found hanged in his cell R.J. and Alyssa decide to dig deeper, though Alyssa is less than impressed with R.J.'s behaviour to this point.
Sheffer is shot from the underbrush, their canoe overturns, and they just decide to saunter through the rainforest in a random direction, even though night is approaching, they are soaking wet, and Sheffer has a gunshot wound.
This does have classic Hitchcock suspense moments though (although the best one comes towards the end).
Even though Willy was a cunning schemer who took control of the boat during a storm, he sealed his own fate by going too far to keep Gus (William Bendix) quiet.
I don't think I'll ever forget the ending though.
et al.. to look back in wonder and emulate but never achieve....yet...  Afterthought: Please note there are some other Brit greats since though with the likes of "sexy beast" and "Gansgter NO1" providing extremely entertaining viewing!
The real hidden star, though, is late-70's London-- oh so run-down and yet full of the potential that drives Harold's ambitions.
But the final drive away,with Brosnan holding Hoskins at gunpoint is now justly famous,holding on Harold's face seemingly endlessly but ingeniously,with all number of expressions telling us so much.This aspect of Hoskins' performance may be it's most impressive,despite being wordless.There has been a problem in some of Bob Hoskins' film roles since;undeniably a very fine actor,Hoskins however has sometimes fallen into the speech patterns and mannerisms of the role that made him a star into some other parts he has played,much to his detriment,though this has mostly been the exception rather than the rule.
Even though I was not around for the era of the big bands, seeing movies like "The Glenn Miller Story" or listening to some Artie Shaw or Tommy Dorsey gave me an appreciation for the music of a previous generation, and an understanding that those of that generation are not hopelessly antiquated.
Simply firing guns (most of which were poor, though Paul's revolver was actually a quality piece) and splattering red paint around doesn't do it.
First let me say that even though Azema and Arditi are forcedly advertised as main characters, Arditi has probably a maximum of 10 minutes of screen time and Azema hardly says any word during the whole movie.
I think it easily matches up to the first Eating Out, though they are very different films.
Each character held there own, though there are a few standouts, including the reprehensible luminary Mink Stole.
"The Insider" is a masterpiece.I only saw it because Al Pacino was in it;the theme really wasn't very interesting for me(I though that was the usual "political-correct" film against tobacco),but then came the big (big!)
Bad news, though, she's a wonderful actress, and she's great here.
It was nominated for 7 Academy Awards, and though I agree with giving Best Picture, Actor, and Director to American Beauty, this film should have won something, possably Best Screenplay.
His Oscar win for the role of Maximus in Gladiator (for which he deserved all the way) makes up for it though.
It slams the tobacco industry and CBS Corporation equally (though CBS News, as such, rises above).
This was one of the best roles I've seen Al Pacino in and though I have not seen a lot of Crowe's work, he is wonderful here and well cast.The supporting cast was wonderful too.
However, I appreciated they didn't shrink from pointing out how the network was covering its own behind even though it was hurting its most successful program.
The trump card of this film though comes in the form of Christopher Plummer playing one of the most visible news figures of the past 25 years, Mike Wallace.
Forgettable bubblegum nonsense, though one with an elaborate production and some energy from supporting players Bert Lahr, Joan Davis, and Bill Robinson.
Even though it is canceled I will never stop watching my Season 1 of Freaks and Geeks and everyone should watch this show!
The late Brandon Tardicoff (I think that's how you spell it) President of NBC, saved Seinfeld when it was in the same situation as F&G: he kept it on the air, even though it was getting low ratings.
The thing about the show that works the best for me though are the characters.
Freaks and Geeks, though unfortunately short lived, is, perhaps, the greatest show in the history of television.
Watching the out-takes, though, you notice that, in fact, that is not even remotely the case.
Even though portrayed in the 70s, somehow it comes off as timeless.
The parents, though pretty dorky (especially Joe Flaherty as DAD), were nice folks as well and you couldn't help but care about them all.
While "Saved by the Bell" might have been the only show to be quite successful with it (though only after significant retooling of the original series, "Good Morning Mrs. Bliss would NBC even agree to pick up the show), my guess is that this show may have initially had a difficult time finding a loyal audience in the crucial early days of the show.
There were issues of drug use and teenage sex which some might not have found ideal for the younger viewers of this show (people in their very early teens as this show tended to sometimes celebrate drug use...even though there was one episode that was clearly anti-drug).
She is wise to him though, having seen what really happened on the golf course.
The film begins with Charley being asked by his friends to come over to play poker, but Charley is a bit henpecked and refuses--though he really did want to play.
Richard Benjamin's direction is sensitive and breezy, and Elizabeth McGovern is a good romantic match for Penn (though sometimes she talks down to him, like a big sister might).
But due mostly to the casts ability to make it so real, so authentic, and so alive and feel so current even though the movie is filmed twenty years ago and set over sixty years ago.
He has good help though.
Their trust paid off well though.
The Unwilling: 11 October 1959 Even though Dan Simpson (Eddie Albert) lost his last cargo, he refuses to give up his dream of building a general store in the West.
One thing was clear though: it was supposed to be followed by a TV series.
The end is *really* incomprehensible and it looks as though it's a pilot movie for a series or something.
He has proved he is better than the average rapper/actor with his performances in films like TRAINING DAY and BABY BOY, though he's still not what most would consider an actual "actor".
Snoop delivers as the ghetto "Frank from Hellraiser" or "Jason Voorhees" or "Freddy Krueger" or whatever the f**k. The kids are as believable as you can get with the lines given to them (Lawson and Isabelle look good though).
The pink blood really takes a lot out of it...it makes it more unrealistic (though not realistic to begin with) and just looks...bad.
Even though the whole movie doesn't make ANY sense at any point, it's just cool to see Mr Dogg in a pimp outfit.
Even though this happens Snoop Dogg gives a great performance as Jimmy Bones but the writing of the character and the movie itself could have been handled better, both had potential that was dropped and ended before the full potential was ever reached.
I'm not sure though that I like the fact that Gus really doesn't seem to have any redeeming character traits.
I would say this show is more like the Mexican version of The Godfather movies though.
Overall, though, the whole thing is murder, mayhem and kitsch with a unique latin flair.
the other two films i've seen from him are documentaries, whereas this one is pretty much a straight film (though it won an academy for best documentary).
So perhaps we shouldn't be surprised to find wooden acting and poor writing in this film, even though Mr. Costner is nowhere to be found.
It was funny to watch though.
SLIGHT SPOILERAGE BELOW ... nothing that explains the movie though Good premise.
It is a "catastrophe" movie, even though it has nothing to do with the typical western idea of such a happening.
As she uncovers the mostly gross secrets of her uncle's life and building, she begins to lose her mind under the strain, though someone in the background might be after her, as well.
Jennifer Jason Leigh gives an excellent performance as a young woman traumatized by some mysterious events in her childhood, even though no one will be surprised by what that trauma is when it's revealed.
Sure, familiar elements are there, but even though the setting is modern for the period, it has a bit of a Gothic feel to it.
I personally though the acting, especially from the lead actress, was atrocious.
Even though most of the actors have only been in a few films, you will wonder why they have not been cast more often.
Classic martial arts movie scenes like the bamboo forest also get featured in this movie, though the forest did look a bit sparse, since it was filmed in a sound stage.
Added to the fight scenes was a demonstration of superb "qing-gong" (light-skill, fleet-footedness) by Fang Gang, though the wire work used was extremely elementary, and came across quite laughably.
Back in those days, this sequence would have been da bomb though.
I think it's probably my favorite short of his, though, considering that it so well mixes everything in animation, stop motion, and real motion, and that overall it's quite adept at forcing you to think about all those children's shows that involve alphabet songs and alphabet animations dancing around, and how a lot of that stuff can be very disconcerting and bizarre if really looked at.
If one knows though the lengths to which the filmmaker is ready to portray his audio-visual interpretations on screen one might appreciate it a little more if they just happen to stumble upon it.
spoilers -- only parts i disliked even though they were realistically portrayed were the orphanage even though im sure thats the way it was back then for orphans.treated meanly but they at least could have listened to her when she said she wasnt an orphan.and also for the father to just leave his kid behind with the landlady who obviously is a rather loose woman .he didnt have time to watch the kid when he was around as she was always playing hooky or sneaking into movie theatres ,,although during the depression , you did what you did to survive but still he should have considered her welfare more than just to leave her like that, he didnt even say goodbye to her at the beginning of the movie when he left.
Natty reaches out for the wolf though and eventually manages to establish a bond with the wild animal.
Kevin Costner (in one of his early roles) stars as Eliot Ness, the leader of the so-called Untouchables, a branch of the government responsible for nabbing the bootleggers in 1930s Chicago (and elsewhere, though the Windy City is the sole focus here.)
I just bought this on dvd the other day allthough i must admit i wasn't looking for it as i wanted to buy ghost world but the shop didn't have it(DAMM YOU WOOLWORTHS IT'S A GREAT MOVIE NOW I AM GOING TO HAVE TO GO TO VIRGIN IN CARDIFF)anyway i went across to w.h smith and even though they didn't have it, they did have this gem on the shelf, so i bought this instead.
I remember seeing this when i was a young kid and even though i didn't totaly understand it at the time, i thought it was so cool.
I somehow doubt, though, that the target audience for this movie were movie watchers who enjoyed this type of film.
On the whole, though, The Untouchables is a fine movie which probably represents De Palma's best work of the '80s.
In real life, there were up to a dozen "Untouchables", whose success was very limited, and never got into any actual shootouts with Capone (though Capone did try to kill Ness himself on at least two occasions).
The movie is extremely authentic in attention to period detail, and though a bit over-the-top, it succeeds in its primary objective: to entertain.
Connery does a great job as Malone, the aging, guilt-ridden cop who becomes Ness's mentor (though his death scene is a bit overdone, I must admit I actually cried the first time I saw it!).
Garcia and Smith have somewhat less to do, though each have their moments (Smith sipping bootleg whiskey during the bridge ambush, and Garcia's initial confrontation with Ness and Malone).
He provides an exhilarating, heroic score which captures the feel and tone of the movie perfectly (though for my money, the heartbreaking "Death Theme", played on solo saxophone, is the best track).
`The Untouchables,' directed by Brian De Palma, is the story of Ness and his men, dubbed `Untouchable' because they couldn't be bought, though from the beginning the odds were stacked against them.
And it subtly underscores the true heroics of men like Ness and his crew, who through their fearless dedication possibly made it a little safer for someone to walk down the street, or for an honest man to simply go about the business of making a living-- things too often taken for granted in our busy world today; things that are important, and which makes a film like this so much more than merely entertainment (though it definitely is that).
All the other films had completely different aims and even though I love a deep and brilliant story my main objective when I see a film is to be entertained and basically no film does that better than The Untouchables.
Charles Martin Smith does a good job as well and even though his character is very limited he still manages to pull the audience in.
The film's best performance belongs to Sean Connery though.
What's odd, though, is that A.C. knows he has superhuman abilities underwater and yet never once questions where they came from.
They put it up on iTunes, though, so maybe if there's enough outcry for it, they'll reconsider.
Overall though, I enjoyed it...There's a lot to work with, but I fear if certain aspects (as mentioned above) are not payed attention to the show will end up being mediocre while it could be GREAT.
Script needs a little more work, though, as occasionally the lines sounded a little comic- booky.
Also featured, among others, are Mario Carotenuto (as Milian's elderly sidekick and conscience) and Ray Lovelock (as one of Moschin's lackeys, though he exits the proceedings rather quickly in one of the film's best scenes).
The main reason I wanted to see this film was for the fact that it stars the excellent Tomas Milian, though like Stelvio Massi; this doesn't represent his best work either.
The supporting cast doesn't stand out as much as Milian (as usual), though it does feature esteemed stars such as Ray Lovelock and Stefania Casini.
There's not a great deal of violence in the film, though that isn't a big problem as the plot itself usually contains enough to keep the audience entertained.
At least the film manages to limp through with a decent finale; though once you've sat through the first eighty five minutes of the film, it could be the best ending of all time and most people would be unlikely to care.
even though he is tough, he loves the kids very much.
All in all, this isn't really for kids, though can be entertaining if they know the subject matter.
Even though it's a one camera comedy with no studio audience or laugh track, it's a sitcom I really enjoyed since the episodes usually featured Bernie talking to the home audience from his easy chair, referring to the people watching at home as "America."
I am so picky, I am annoy myself at times and though I occasionally fail to get hooked on some episodes of the re-runs, today I was reminded just how brilliant enjoyable this show is.
Worth it a shot at least for the story, but otherwise, it's about the same muddle film as City Limits (though certainly not as bad).
And though nearly seven years younger than Raft, just a little age makeup makes her look as if she could at least be his aunt.
I've never been able to spot him though.
Well, much of the movie is spent trying to win her back, though he still wonders whether or not to rob his "friends".
The film is accompanied by music from JosÃ© Nieto, though on some occasions I detected certain other sources, most notably a piece which sounded like `tafelmusik' by Georg Philippe Telemann - more than a hundred years later.
This is a thinking person's movie though.
This is not the problem, though.
Even though the scenes were sweet and beautifully shot, it was a complete mystery where the story was headed.
Nothing can redeem this tour de merde though.
As some I heard the opinion from they though this film was badly boring in its talking and in its trying to teach us a lesson in all from the history of Europe, good manners, communication and so forth.
I specially liked when the little girl asked her mother for the meaning of some words that, even though we use a lot in every day conversation, almost no one knows its precise meaning.
I'm not sure who the others are, though certainly Rohmer, maybe the newer Kurosawa, and probably Kiarostami if he didn't have so many imitators, his own children among them.
The quietly inane dialog, from one character, though I'd known it immediately for hilarious dead-on satire, she'd attributed to the nearly ninety-year-old De Oliveira's finally losing touch.
And even though Rondo wasn't the world's greatest actor, there's something oddly compelling about his performance and The Brute Man in general.
In this case, we are given the character's tragic back-story Â though it actually does a disservice to actor Rondo Hatton (deformed in real life by acromegaly) by making his condition self-inflicted and rendering him homicidal into the bargain!
Anyway, though it shares many a credit with the subsequent film, this one (which proved to be Hatton's last) was actually made by the Poverty Row company PRC.
To give some measure of sympathy to the titular figure, we also get a subplot in which he is sheltered by a blind pianist (shades of BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN [1935] and THE FACE BEHIND THE MASK [1941]): eventually, though, she allows herself to be used as bait in a trap set for him by the Police (with flustered Donald MacBride at their head!).
Even though the grotesque drifter's bloody scheme is terrifying, antihero Moffett never seems like a purely evil monster.
Well I'm not gonna say anymore about the movie, see it for yourself :) Anyway i though this movie was great and i recommend it to those who like little different movies with dope and all that.
The boys being regarded as three missing links; feeling ashamed at the prospect of being turned into gentlemen; Symona Boniface telling Moe, "You act as though the sword of Damocles is hanging over your head!
Even though it now looks so dated, I mean, no dot coms, facebook or cell phones here, the meat of the story holds true now, as it did in '84.
Even though I am having trouble finding reruns of it on TV, and I must resort to watching YouTube clips permanently downloaded on my computer, they are enough to drown me in childhood memories and also memories of that silly Polkaroo.
Enjoy it while you can - though presumably as a BBC Films production it'll be on the small screen soon - big screens are better!
Still, Romola Garai and Rose Byrne were lovely as Cassandra and Rose, even though the central romances in the story were subverted by the performances of Thomas and Blucas.
I enjoyed the book but am not that devoted a fan, and though I was sorry to see characters and scenes I liked left out, I know it would be impossible to make a movie that retained everything in a full-length novel.
On the positive side, the scenery was beautiful (though wrong for the supposed setting) and the acting was good for the most part.
Overall though, "I capture the castle" is sweetly and undemandingly entertaining, and Romola Garai's vulnerability is intoxicating.
Our heroes trundle into town with a wagon load of gold, $300-thousand, and try to collect the bounty on Bill, though all they have of him is his boots and hat.
The electrician had the best quote in the movie though, which is right after he strangled that security guard.
It was still enjoyable though and is fairly fun to watch.
Of course, it was a little too much like Puppet Master, though the characters, I mean the dolls as characters were too much like Demonic Toys.
If you like Puppet Master, but thought it needed some female degradation to really liven it up this might just float your boat, otherwise pass it by on the torrent shelves Wouldn't watch it again though.
The female band - though clearly sexy in appearance - are not developed enough as individual characters.
The film's antagonists, though much more normal (with one notable exception), may not be as weirdly entertaining as the film's bizarre protagonists, but they are well-acted (they have to be, since they don't have a gimmick to fall back on) and still great characters (they just have incredible protagonists to contend with!
Like many Full Moon releases, CG-effects were ditched in favor of practical effects, and though they worked well for Virgil and the rest of the film, the Blood Dolls are not as animated as their fellow killer-puppets in the Puppet Master series; they look fantastic but move more stiffly.
The strange thing is though, people are turning up dead and they are dying just as it was written in book.
I think this film gets a wee bit overrated on these pages, for though it is a well made, enjoyable effort and better put together than many slashers, especially the late period ones, it is hardly some great underrated gem.
The film has a neat Fifties pulp feel to it, though updated with more scares and a bit of bloodshed.
Director Tibor Takacs maintains a constant sense of reality bending intrigue and though nothing is especially surprising, the film has such a well oiled, easy flow that its near impossible not to get caught up in it.
Worth a watch, though best not too expect fireworks.
Overall I didn't think I would but I actually rather liked I, Madman, don't like that title though.
Alan Ladd, though in decline personally and professionally at this point in his life, is, nevertheless, very good as the troubled Alec.
And, it seems as though every time I watch it.
For the Bible Tells me So by Daniel Karslake is a very powerful documentary about five very different, though highly religious families each raised in different denominations of the Christian Church, and how these families deal with the knowledge that one of their children is a homosexual.
Even though I believed I knew the Bible, I was surprised to find out that I hadn't a clue to the passages often quoted by Christian fundamentalists in their hatred of homosexuals.
3 and is worth watching, though the Collection as a whole is most highly recommended without reservation.
A total mess, though I do give it credit for trying to dip into different genres, but when you title your film "Drive-In Massacre," that is what you need to deliver!
This does have a great tag line on the video cover though, 'You'll pay to get in...and pray to get out!!
The proprietor doesn't care if this happens, even though it could cost him his business.
The video cover is good, though.
Parents should be aware of this before allowing the munchkins to watch DRIVE-IN MASSACRE--though with a title like this, I guess you aren't expecting a Disney film!
But these are men who hold to their illusions with a death-grip; one guy still wants to have long rock star hair though he's basically bald on top, which is a metaphor for how these guys avoid facing the truth; that they are not great filmmakers waiting to be discovered, but rather mere obsessives with eroded imaginations.
The main drive isn't clear right away though.
One thing they all seem to have in common though, is a love for such classic horror films as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Last House on the Left", both films being mentioned by all of the filmmakers as having a huge impact on them when they were young.
(though there's a great ending sequence where a lot of them accomplish their immediate goals) Against all odds, they are out there shooting, getting it done, (hopefully) learning more about their craft etc.
The competent but mostly unimaginative direction is by Howard Koch (though he does stage a pretty exciting chase sequence involving a NYC transit bus).
Not this time, though!
To see this movie though is to understand how Bette Davis became a legend.
The only laughs I got were at the expense of the acting and the script (if there even was a script, often it felt as though the entire movie was being ad-libbed by a first-year college movie class).
A good part of the film is just Zwigoff using his camera to get into the main mind-set of Crumb, not just necessarily with interviews with his family members or friends and co-workers (though there is a lot of that), but also through the presentation of his work, often in medium close-ups, with awesome blues melodies and tunes in the background.
There are some disaffecting matters here though, particularly the patronising of the southern negro, all "yes'm'" and "clap yo' hands" - even if this is the way old Dixie treated its coloured inhabitants it's still painful to view the coarse stereotyping.
I first found out about R. Crumb through "Fritz The Cat" even though he was opposed to the movie (which I must say I thoroughly enjoyed!)
Basically it shows Robert Crumb, the artist famous for "Keep On Truckin'", "Fritz The Cat" (though he does not like to be associated with either of them) and "Mr. Natural", telling the story of his life through his wife and brothers, with a few scenes of him at a vernissage and a comic book store (etc.)
That said, he does an adequate job providing the love interest for Ms. Shearer, even though that subplot mostly gets in the way of the historical aspects of the film.
Louis XVI (Robert Morley in his film debut practically stole the show and earned the nomination for the Best Supporting Actor), the grandson of Louis XV, was swept away in the French Revolution--even though he himself was relatively modest, unassuming, and moral.
Things don't turn out all that well for her, though.
Even though history paints him as inept and weak, the movie gives a heart to this unfortunate man (as it does for Marie) that evokes compassion and understanding.
Norma Shearer's nomination for an Academy Award was well deserved but, unfortunately she was up against another actress in equally powerful role & the award went to Bette Davis in Jezebel & though I love the movie Jezebel I wished Norma Shearer had won.
Still, there's enough fluttery melodrama on display in the picture's first-half to make it worth-seeing for Davis-buffs, though the second-half concerning a spreading epidemic lacks urgency.
Eventually, Bronson finds himself risking personal injury from his prey as the authorities close in on him, though they aren't even sure what to do with him since, thanks to him, crime has dropped considerably!
Interestingly, he never really speaks out against the police though his son more than once says "nobody can do anything."
The film-making though is quite solid; one thing Winner can do is propel a story forward, with very little in the way of needless exposition or explanation.
And instead of a hero that didn't seem to care too much about this killing (though it was mostly just the actor, Tom Jane)we had the cool three dimensional Charles Bronson.
I knew that there was also a kind of historical context for the times, of how it was in New York City as well as in others during the 70's (though especially in the 70's)- I remembered my mother telling me about how the atmosphere of 'Death Wish' with its thieves and rapists and abusers was for real, that they were around every corner, and that crime was indeed at an all-time high then.
college kids) will be attracted to it for its 'retro' style, and, as it is in the vein of a film like Taxi Driver (though less visceral), as a stylistic action film.
The manner in which this is resolved is creative, though its plausibility is less than certain.
As "Erik Kessler," a man who returns under an assumed identity to the wife who has remarried because she though he was dead, he's heavily made-up and talks with a corny and contrived sounding German accent.
I never forgot it though and recently bought the video on Amazon, and enjoyed it even more, maybe as it brought back a nostalgia for the 1980s.
This brings up my first observation, though, on Scorcese: his stunning and beautiful camera work.
It's one of his best, even though many critics did not like it when it came out.
The worst part of this film though is its relentless plodding from one uninteresting scene to another.
One of the first things you'll notice on the DVD is that the print is really, really bad--though it does get a bit better later.
He, of course, goes on some obligatory rampages and since this is a so-called "Blaxploitation" film, you see two ladies' breasts--though it really made no sense at all and was very, very contrived.
One of the jokes, though a bit crude, is funny and he was pretty cute.
Even the supporting actors are excellent, though I really did not think that Fay Bainter (playing Davis' aunt) deserved the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (though she got it), as her role was pretty small and not particularly transcendent.
The absurdities don't stop there, though.
I had no idea that he had such a cinematic eye though.
Even though it also expresses a common theme of "even trusted friends are capable of betrayal," there's no reason to be sad from seeing this movie.
It's not fully arty though.
Well even though this movie was predictable, lacked the hotties that i come to expect in good teen comedies and most of the jokes were very creative but badly executed i really didn't dislike the movie.
Seriously though, good fun for the entire family... if your family has an average IQ of just under 14.
What would expect though?
I also love the new look of Godzilla he looks meaner and more destructive even though he's a bit smaller.
also, though the middle 40 minutes has no godzilla, what many people fail to mention is that it has a big ol' UFO that flies around and blows things up, plus a pretty good bunch of plot advancements.
Despite its bad points, though, Godzilla 2000 is a very fast paced and exciting entry into the Godzilla.
Even though a lot of the effects in this film still involve the "man-in-a-suit-a-saurus" style of monster, they are excellent!
I once liked the 2nd series of Godzilla movies (1984-1995), even though I found something annoying about those movies (as either the bad or good guy, Godzilla was so sympathetic that the human characters came off as obnoxious).
They felt as though Godzilla was about to lose his fans, because of this red-blooded American box-office disaster, so to make up for it, they made this movie, GOJIRA NI-SEN MIRENIAMU (Godzilla 2000: Millennium), which was a "take that" to GINO.
Ookawara doesn't care much for Godzilla, though his work is actually okay.
He's better than Kazuki Oomori (not only the worst Godzilla director, in my opinion, but he is completely embarrassed with monsters and stuff), though.
Hattori's original score is about 50-75% intact, though.
I didn't mind it, though.
I did hear, though, that the US version was put together at the last minute (to meet a tight deadline), which explains a lot.
Also, they kind of ignore the movie Godzilla vs. Destroyah even though they show Godzilla's son taking over the reigns this fact is ignored and all the characters from the 90 films are ignored as well.
I saw "Godzilla 2000" at the theater and wasn't disappointed, even though a lot has changed since Toho killed off their iconic monster at the end of 1995's "Godzilla Vs.
This new foe is actually a nasty little creature that's never given a name, though subsequent debate about the film has concluded that its name is "Orga," who proceeds to try to consume Godzilla and his powers, thus creating one powerful monster.
Though it's evident with this production that Godzilla is the bad guy (pending on your view), this was one of the things that really struck me as unique about the previous generation of kaiju-eiga films - in that you never really knew if he was the bad guy or not - this movie makes that pretty clear to you, even though the new monster Orga is clearly the bigger problem for the people of Japan.
It's not all intrigue and planning though.
I just saw this one yesterday (on one of those big, cheap DVD sets from "Mill Creek" - thank heaven for that company), and I have nearly the opposite opinion of Bryce David (though maybe for pretty flimsy reasons).
Worth watching for the cliches alone, not much else though.
He had the best lines, and even though at times he was a little too winy, he was the most likable of the bunch.
Even though my kids are getting older they still enjoy watching this movie, and I do too.
Even though its from Disney there's no Syrup.
Bingo was a sweet dog, though.
Donna D'Errico does her best to perform well in such an ineptly written and totally dull role and one does start to take some enjoyment from her performance even though it is only that of a B-Movie actress.
There is enough gore for anyone though and I kind of liked the way the director tried to experiment with white lights to create a different atmosphere.
With that said though, this was one lame horror movie with no substance, flair, or even good gore/special effects.
The most offensive aspect of the film, though, is its storyline, recycled from bits and pieces of the first two films to the point of idiocy.
But you have to remember the movie didn't cost that much and was shot in three weeks.Tony Todd is good as Candyman and seems even more evil than he was in the last two movies.Even though the movie is less scary than the other two, Todd himself is still as frightening as before.The movies story is good, probably one the best ever in a horror movie.
No one believes her of course that he is still real, Candyman is back though and he is murdering her friends one by one while she gets the blame.
It opens well,but it rapidly descends into the worst Candyman film of the series.The first and foremost problem is that it is just not scary at all,ever.It's pretty gory here and there (much like it's predecessors) but at no point does it ever jolt you or put any sense of dread into you.Another thing is that the performances are absolutely rubbish.D,Errico is okay in the lead role,even though she kept reminding me of Midlands glamour model Jakki Degg (she looks about ten years younger than she actually is,too),but Todd,as the Candyman,is here unable to liven up the proceedings,just robotically churns out his lines much less effectively than in his last two outings as the titular monster and even appears slightly bored,like he popped a valium or two before filming began.The supporting cast are what really weigh the film down,the most witless,inept bunch of hopeless nobodies who'd probably have trouble getting work in a daytime TV show (except maybe the one who played Caroline's mum!)
Samantha Morton's role as the suffering girlfriend to Craig's Joe is a disappointment though.
And even though Joe is perplexed by this, he is drawn into Jed's tantalising web, the essence of which destroys the cosy veneer of heterosexual normalcy Joe takes for granted.
Director Roger Michell shows a generally sure touch, though in places the score is a little intrusive.
The script at times seems confusing, even though its mostly 2 or 3 people talking.
I was very excited to find out there was a movie based on the novel, even though I stayed cautious, not wanting to be too disappointed.
Some of the better parts of the movie though involve the dialog and how it examines love and/or how the main character looks at it vs. his tormentor, lover, and class.
What a pity though because the idea was good and it had potential.
The performances are good, with Flynn very handsome and charming, though signs of seediness were beginning to show.
Lupino gives a sympathetic portrayal, though she's slightly miscast.
For big fans of Errol and big fans of period romance musical comedy/drama combo,this movie will deliver the goods.The story hits the spot for the genre.Very good music,very good cast and acting as well.What kpt this movie from becoming a classic though was the low budget and average directing.The cinematography was also below average.But still,Errol Flynn is so charming here as usual and for the right audience,it's still a winner.This film was unfairly under rated due to the dreaded anti-Flynn syndrome bandwagon......
no Jim Peterson, the guy who played Hank though.
The lesson though was now burned into the heads of the woman's movement - don't ally yourself with other causes.
Having watched it for myself, I was duly impressed though I wouldnât quite place it in the genreâs top ranksâ¦but thatâs because the standards set by the invigorating noir style during its heyday were so high.
For once, too, Hayden is on the side of the law â CRIME WAVE actually came roughly in between his two most famous noir roles in John Hustonâs THE ASPHALT JUNGLE (1950) and Stanley Kubrickâs THE KILLING (1956), both of them classic heist films in which he had played the fated leader of a criminal gang â though his character is just as cynical, tough and uncompromising as ever.
Not hateful nor whiney about his lot, he simply keeps trying at life, even though his combination of intelligence, appreciation of subtlety and unfortunate odd looks keep him from the mainstream life connections that might fulfill him.
It fell down in a number of ways though: I really disliked the 2-dimensional way in which the character of Enid's father was treated - it seemed like a really cynical way of ruling out the "family" option.
Even though Dennis is a dweeb, he isn't trying to be anything else.
I guess you can also equate it with Antonioni's work, though his films deal less with the artist, and more with the disillusionment that comes with perception.
She quickly discriminates against others, though I think that most of the time, she is justified.
The first half of the movie, though, was one of the funniest, darkest setups I have ever seen.
Their plan backfires, though, and Enid becomes a little obsessed with the man.
They're here on the fringes though, just existing in their own parallel universe, or their own "ghost world."
The shared scenes between Enid and Seymour, though doomed to take a bad turn, are handled with tenderness by the director and actors and are quite memorable and touching.
This is usually done in the form of huge death machines in the shape of animals or birds ('Panic of the Peacock', 'Beast with a Sweet Tooth', 'Attack of the Alien Wasp'), but sometimes G-Force found themselves up against pirates ('Ace from Outer Space') or mercenaries ('A Swarm of Robot Ants') though Spectra was usually involved in some way.
A little variety might have made the series more interesting though it's easy to understand why the writers made it this way.
However, I did enjoy it and can recommend it, though with some warnings.
Even though I think the fog idea could have been used better.
Holmes is depicted as an isolated figure, rendered separate from the general run of humanity by his ego and intelligence, who finds solace in drug use and the minutiae of criminal investigations, though his antipathy toward women is challenged here by Watson's American fiancÃ©e (Helen McCrory), a trained psychologist who shares many of his preoccupations and refuses to be cowed by her position within society.
This is a good-looking production (apart from the occasional wobble from the annoyingly popular unsteadicam), though I have it on good authority that London fog did not swirl rapidly around the lampposts and chimneypots.
The superb Helen McCrory, as Watson's American fiancÃ©e, initially appears brash and pushy (she calls Holmes "Sherlock" throughout, even though his best friend Watson invariably calls him by his last name), an often-observed trait of American women in British film/TV productions, but she is too good an actress to keep to that one-note character.
Offered a big budget and a 35-day shooting schedule if he made it with Humphrey Bogart and Ava Gardner, de Toth held out for Sterling Hayden even though it mean a fraction of the budget and a 15-day shooting schedule Â and still managed to come in ahead and shoot the film in only 13 days.
The film does briefly give into sentimentality at the end Â though very, very begrudgingly Â and it's never quite as good as that powerhouse first third, but it's certainly a sharp punch below the belt to the cop movie that you won't forget in a hurry.
The only downside to the film is that some of the characters are miscast (Steve Buscemi, Natasha Lyonne), though talented actors to be sure.
Most of the performances are very good though I disagree with some that Harvey Keitel's was up to his usual brilliance.
A film to be cherished, though with a thoughtful warning...
You should pick a right night for this evening though, because everything, from the gassing to cleaning to burning, is shown uncensored in this movie.
I saw this movie at The Hong Kong Lesbian & Gay Film Festival, though this funny, witty and entertaining movie about love and passions set against a cross-cultural, Glaswegian background could be featured at any film festival.
There is a sincerity to the part that Matt Salinger brings, and with his niavity and his boyish-good looks, it looks as if Cap is truly a hero from the 1940's, who has stepped out of his time and into ours and is truly amazed at the changes that have come (though attempts to give him lines featuring old 40's terms such as "Gee-wizz" and "holy mackeral" don't come off so well).
Must like Michael Corleone in the "Godfather 2" (though on a much smaller level), in the film's final scenes, he builds himself up as a great, powerful crimelord, but to the viewer, he simply comes across as pitiful.
Even though Men in Black was a success, Marvel has had more hits than misses: The Spider Man TV movies, The Punisher (a guilty pleasure of mine to watch), and The Fantasic Four (I remember E!
About the movie though.
The General was one of the first silent movies that I was ever able to sit though long enough to fully appreciate the medium.
Still a worthy watch though.
Even though the GENERAL was sitting in a rail yard available in 1925 when this was being filmed, the railroad would not let Keaton use it.
The storyline is simple, even though it is multilayered.
Then we move into a second extraneous, but still amusing, story regarding a battle between the North and the South that could've been excised and still having a decent, though simple, story.
The score is great, though it is overly noisy and annoying at times, most of the time it fits in well with the character were watching and his or her state of mind.
A sadly boring spectacle of a biblical film, even though almost all the production values are of a high quality (except that special effect vulture).
This film wets the whistle for seeing Ms. Carter do an X rated feature though I don't think she ever did one.
Everyone is firing real bullets, though, and soon it's not any fun.
Even though this under rated movie by Joe (Gremlins) Dante is for kids I still love watching it and it fulfills all kids dreams who look up at the stars and wonder what the heck is out there.
Remarkably the film still holds up well even though it's a movie primarily aimed at children, however the film is really brought down by the third act.
I have a soft spot in my heart for this underrated Joe Dante pic, though I'm the first to admit it has more than a few problems.
It never quite regains its footing after that, though the final dream sequence is nicely uplifting.
Having a cast like that, though, sure doesn't hurt.
Some characters are boring, though influential, some overstay their visit and some you wish for more, like an old man who shows us his vineyard in the countryside.
Regardless, I have to commend the cast for trying something unique and epic, though in today's light the film is a totally boring mess and only of interest to cinephiles.
Toward the end, though, the blood and gore in THE TOOLBOX MURDERS gets more overt and that costs the film the other two stars.
The murderer in the film is great, and one could consider it Parson's homunculus in-a-way, though the "coffin-birth" masks this element.
Much of the film involves her unraveling of the Arms's secrets, though no full explanation as to how the black arts is incorporated is ever explained.
Shakespeare may have beamed well-pleased at this chosen Richard, a fellow thespian who, according to an interview reproduced on the DVD, had to mouth the words to fully capture the role even though no sound would survive the flowing decades.
Surprisingly, she won the lead role and embarked on her short though interesting career.
Florence Rice is very good in what looks like a sympathetic role, and is, though she's initially on the wrong side of the law.
One has, though, a feeling that nothing has been discarded, the way the film appears to work its way through its four endless scenes!
Others, though, may feel that 60+ minutes of one's life could be spent in a better way than watching this - which is about as exciting as looking at a glass of cold water becoming lukewarm - such as, for example, sleeping comfortably in one's bed as opposed to dozing off in a chair in front of a TV-screen.
Paul collapse into alcoholism (though we never see him inhale any wacky tobakky)!
If you want the real Linda story though, you may have to get it from one of the bios written about her but not this movie.
In Phantom Raiders Nick Carter answers the duty call while on vacation and is sent to Panama to investigate the mysterious sinking of several cargo ships near the Panama coast where he is joined by his eccentric assistant Bartholomew who as usually provides sometimes a valuable help and on other occasions creates havoc though always remaining handy.
Something to talk about is one of them and though not the MOST boring movie I have ever seen it certainly comes close.
Average family comedy/drama movie that had a great cast but average story/screenplay.The script was above average though and the performances was also good.The cinematography was bad and so was the lighting.Story deals with adultery and the trials of fixing a marriage after the affair.Nothing spectacular.Only for family soap comedy/drama fans and big fans of the lead actors.....
The police at the end, though only expressing concern for a young boy sleeping on a park bench alone seem like the bad guys.
The title is nothing new though, as with movies as far back like An American Tale, where its theme song played on that exact same premise, of having to gaze up at the moon knowing that the person in your heart is probably doing the same thing and thinking of you too.
I was truly moved by this movie even though there are many parts that are simply unbelievable.
Even though there are these "errors" one must realize that this a work of fiction and these sort of incongruencies do not detract from the overall power of the film.
I think this movie did not get as much credit as it should have for the simple fact that it was filmed by a Mexican production company even though it was released by 20th Century Fox.
One thing though, Rosario never lets a Sunday go by without calling her son in Mexico at 10am.
However, when his grandmother dies, Carlitos decides to cross the US/Mexican border with the help of two young Chicanos (America Ferrara and Jesse GarcÃ­a), since doÃ±a Carmen, la coyote (Carmen Salinas), refuses to help him, due to a promise made to Rosario, Carlito's mother, even though she handles an illegal crossing business.
However, things for him will get complicated right from the beginning, starting a dangerous, but beautiful and rich travel from his impoverished Mexico to the modern L.A., meeting a lot of people that, somehow, try to help him on his way to his mother, though things won't be easy at all.
Along the way, we are witness to many situations undocumented aliens are exposed to, and the film makes an honest attempt to present most people in a fair way, though there are some characterizations that are at best sketchy.
Eventually I'm pretty sure nothing happens at the end but even though I just finished a couple of hours ago I can't remember much other than feeling very grateful.
This is a pretty decent movie (Magnolia Pictures always seem to do excellent work), with great acting, a superior story and deep insight into the lives of people most don't understand - those who wish to be handicapped even though they're not.
Kern was the equal of any of them and though Roberta doesn't include his most original or memorable songs, those we do hear are both sonorous and technically adept.
The characters alone make the movie funny, even though they are not aiming to make you laugh.
This isn't a mobster film even though the main character, Vinnie (Steve Martin) is a rat.
Even though Vinnie tries to help he starts to get back into the business he was meant for, crime.
He soon realizes that though he has left the mob the mob hasn't left him..Rick Moranis plays the skeptical FBI agent.
RKO decided to invest a little glamor into the project by transporting the whole thing to Paris and it was a wise move, though the film never got further to Paris than the RKO back lot.
Can you imagine a show though that had besides those I already mentioned, Fred MacMurray, George Murphy, and Sydney Greenstreet all in the cast.
It's a riot, though in general this movie has more subtlety and less laugh out loud laughs than his previous films but it all works together so well, it's not a problem.
it was also strange that even though Dick knew that Allen was with Linda all the time he was away from her and that she even mentioned his name in her sleep Dick for the life of him couldn't put two and two together.
Beyond Allen, Keaton shows the first signs of her unmatched comic prowess as Linda, though for the most part, she is called upon to be the conflicted leading lady.
Dean and Sam come across a strange death in Oklahoma, concerning a construction worker who was found - minus a brain... Doctors shrug it off as Mad Cow Disease, though the brother's decide to do a little more thorough investigation around a new housing development where it seems insects are acting slightly odd.
Turns out Matt's an innocent by-stander to the bug attack, though.
The father doesn't believe them, though, and the bugs attack too quickly for them to get out.
Colbert is her naturally effervescent self, though she is well into her forties here and a mite too mature for the early scenes when she is playing a blushing newlywed to the twelve-years younger Welles.
I'm trying to figure out Shelly Winters role though.
It is still interesting to watch though.
Be warned though, the fight-scenes in this exist to serve to explain the story, and not for the sake of action.
I am anxious for some new and fresh material from him though as some of this was repeated in the Pimp Chronicles on his HBO Special.
Dr. Zoidberg: a big blobby crab, obviously the group's own doctor, even though he knows as much about medicine as much as Fry knows about...anything.
They took everything they learned when working on The Simpsons and applied it, though overall I do prefer that to this.
The characters are not yellow, though.
I never found this show to be as funny as the Simpsons, though.
The show manages to have several guest stars even though it is set centuries in the future by having the technology to keep people's heads preserved in jars, strangely this even works for people who are long dead in the present.
The characters are well constructed and funny, though I think that the character we can all relate to is Fry.
I was 9 though.
Everything else is a blur and I'm guessing that I repressed the rest of the movie, even though I watched it a few more times in simple shock that it was so bad, even by my lax standards.
The funny thing about this movie, though, is the weird cinematography and sets.
(That's not her fault, though, it's how the character was written.)
The light touch that these two great actresses bring to "Wife vs. Secretary" offsets one of the fundamental conflicts and tragedies of life - that though we are often presented with two paths in life, we can only choose one - knowing that we will always wonder about the other....  
Susan Sonntag, author of the influential essay "On Photography", would have had a field day as a talking head, though I'm not sure she could have done better in presenting us with an interpretation of the pics than some of the more level-headed interviewees do.
Astaire has only one solo to "I Won't Dance"; and perhaps to pacify fans, there is a brief reprisal dance inserted after the story's actual ending though dramatically it makes little sense.
The real centrepiece of the film, though, are the photographs.
Who could ever forget his stellar, though uncredited, performances in 1969 as Rupert of Rathskeller in the "To Sire With Love" episodes of Get Smart?
Having visited Corrigidor, I was hopeful for a powerful, though period based piece.
It's no longer just an escapist nightmare/fantasy to suggest that what is being depicted in the film might actually happen, and the filmmakers should indeed be congratulated for pretty much getting the look of the apocalypse right ... though I do think that people would have found more opportunities to wash their faces & would think that ammunition for firearms would be a bit more of a rarity.
For instance: The actress playing JJ (though very good) is too old for the part I don't buy her as a teenager at all - and everyone's hair is far too clean.
Because of that, I probably had a slight predisposition to dislike the film--though I liked it more than Medved, as it was not even close to being that bad!
Laughton was also responsible for the casting of O'Hara, even though Hitchcock had not wanted to use her after a poor screen test.
(I can't refrain from quoting what Elsa Lanchester, Laughton's wife, said about Mrs. O'Hara:'--She looks as though butter wouldn't melt in her mouth, or anywhere else'.)
And as bad Hitchcock movies go, "Jamaica Inn" is moderately more entertaining than others like "Number 17," "The Paradine Case," and "Topaz," though for the same reason it is so awful: Charles Laughton.
Unfortunately a lot of the story elements are very predictable -- Laughton's behavior from the very beginning is far from the "gentleman" who O'Hara seems to take him for rather naively even though she's seen him toss a bag of coins to his compatriots after losing a bet on her beauty.
This is revealed largely through the relationship between Sir Humphrey and his manservant Chadwick (Horace Hodges), one that has vague homo-erotic connotations (possibly just a fanciful invention of Laughton, though Hitchcock couldn't have failed to have noticed it).
I'm not a huge expert on Hitchcock in particular though, but I have noticed the humor involved in his suspense scenes, a device he also used in "The Lady Vanishes" and all the way through "North by Northwest."
Even though it is one of the weakest works of Hitchcock, the film surprisingly provides rich cinematic flourishes.
I don't think the cinematography deserved a best Oscar, though.
Furthermore, even though The Third Man is a British film, its view on Old Europe is distinctively American.
I suppose it would be a sin for me to give away how Harry Lime reappears, or even give away the fact that he does, for that matter (though by now I am sure you realize Orson Welles is in this movie and therefore turns out to be alive).
Orson Welles has perhaps the best part, even though his time before the camera is short.
From James, Lars, Kirk and Jason, to Bob Rock and Randy Staub (Engineer), I got a real sense of how difficult the recording of this album was for the six of them, its as though they find it just as difficult to revisit and talk about.
Should have been better though.
The plot, though not entirely believable, at least made some sense, no small triumph in today's mystery/thriller genre.
Vincent Perez as Diderot plays the character superbly wearing a delightful smile though not much else when he poses for his portrait by the beautiful Madame Therbouche, a so-called painter from Berlin though actually a spy arranged by the Cardinal.
Even though the film was about as accurate as a description of why and how we got involved in that disastrous war, against the sound advice of men like Maj, Barker, as any movie about the subject that's ever been released!
Mostly though this is a visual treat.
All the facets of the soldiers are portrayed, though often through amplified stereotypes, giving the viewer a feel for what made the soldiers tick.
It's an interesting experiment and attempt to reconstruct a lost movie, though it of course doesn't work out as good as the moving images would had.
At the rime of its release the movie already got mixed reactions from the critics, though the movie still was the highest grossing Tod Browning/Lon Chaney movie.
It really looked like Lon Chaney's presence uplifted the movie though, both with his looks and performance.
This movie forms a good enough alternative to still be able to watch this lost 1927 movie from legendary director Tod Browning and actor Lon Chaney, until the real movie shows up again somewhere, though this isn't very likely to ever happen.
This film is hardly a masterpiece, though it does have some good moments and plenty of action.
a madman has stolen two nuclear warheads and threatens to detonate them over a populated area if his demand for money is not met.that's the gist of the story.it stars John Travolta,Christian Slater,Samantha Mathis and Delroy Lindo,to name a few.it's a pulse pounding thriller from John Woo(mission Impossible 2).there's obviously a lot of action,and suspense,and the movie goes right down to the wire.John Travolta is good,as is Christian Slater,but i really liked Samantha Mathis,who i feel is and underrated actress.the action scenes are are exhilarating,though admittedly over the top.but for thrills,you can't beat it.for me,Broken Arrow is an 8/10
I really enjoyed these last two hours- but I was the perfect audience, so to say: As a German with huge interest in Japanese culture, a basic knowledge both of Japanese language and traditions(though in both I still have lots to learn) - I can understand many jokes which are often unnoticed.
For me though, i give 9/10.
Doris Dorrie has got the uncanny knack of rendering us speechless with her serious comic sagas which depict mundane human foibles.Erleuchtung Garantiert recounts a few mirthful episodes in the lives of its "crazy about spirituality" protagonists Uwe and Gustav.Uwe has never meditated in his life but still believes that it would help him in lessening his conjugal distress.The problems arise for them as they foolishly spend all their money in Tokyo.Things come to such a pass that they are forced to spend a few restless nights on the streets.Uwe and Gustav seem to have lost themselves completely in a metropolis like Tokyo where everyone is busy chatting on their mobile phones.The path to enlightenment is tricky for them but they happily tolerate all inconveniences in order to find spiritual bliss.They finally reach the Monzen monastery where they comprehend their innate strengths and weaknesses.Uwe overcomes the agony arising out of his failed marriage.Gustav realizes that he was never happy leading the life as a heterosexual male.He grasps that he has always been a homosexual person.Even though Erleuchtung Garantiert has been shot on Digital Video,it still manages to retain its ineffable charm.
The acting is terrible, and even though the film is only 1hr 15 mins long they keep reminding you with awful pieces of dialogue about what happened a few minutes ago.
However for those who read the book (such as me), there may be some level of disappointment (not for me though).
Congrats to my friend Matt Sanford, though!
Even though I'm male and got attracted by the promise of frontal nudity, I now find this film strong for totally different reasons.
Also, the actions of the local townspeople from Dwight to Diana's flatmate Rita (Lisa Hill) never seem unrealistic (though the ending did seem a little out of place after everything which had gone before it).
Russell deliver's Hildy's lines so naturally it was as though MacArthur and Hecht wrote that dialog for her, specifically.
In all but one case the image quality looks as though the entire print had been fed through a meat grinder.
Even though Howard Hawks did add a romance into The Front Page he did not sacrifice one iota of the biting satire from Hecht and MacArthur.
My favorite however, brief though his scenes are is Billy Gilbert who is a messenger from the governor who is delivering a sentence commutation.
This is a frenetic comedy, and while the impending hanging of Earl Williams is certainly serious, this plot is more of an excuse to observe the machinations of Hildy and Walter - it's a subplot, though it drives the main story.
And that's just for starters: The timing of the thing is still awe- inspiring after sixty-odd years; the supporting actors, down to the bit-players, are all memorable, convincing and hilarious; the camera work (this IS the forties, though) is inventive and the editing superb.
Director Howard Hawks wanted to show the whirlwind pace of the newsroom in the criminal courts system so he had his actors overlap their lines -- so much so that at times it seems as though everyone is talking at once; it even gets difficult to understand all that is going on.
Eric Mabius makes a really good Crow, though he is sort of a more "anti-hero" filled with rage in this movie instead of a good guy.
A warning though, you really have to be a certain kind of person to enjoy this movie.
Not a bad actress in her own right, though I doubt that's why she's got so many male fans.
As for the girl, she is disturbed by having a peasant boy around the house and treats him as rudely as she can though she is also pretty much interested in catching attention of Recep.
The two young actors look artificial at some points though their general performance is satisfactory enough!
HERE is a film, though made more than thirty years ago, with performances by some of the greatest artists of their time, many of which are STILL performing today!
And even though there are some CGIs used for some of the scenes where the two main characters meet, I still think this is a sick tale to put on screen.
I said good but this show is amazing...  After watching the first episode most people will discard it as a kids show, personally, I wouldn't let my kids anyway near this show, although I like horror movies and shows it's really rare for me to feel horror myself, this show though, did it like no other.
You should watch the whole show, though, if you expect to understand any of it (even twice won't hurt, if you'll like it as much as I do), but only after seeing the sequel "Higurashi no naku koro ni kai" (which is not half as good, and can't really be called "horror") you'll really understand more then a few pieces.
(not children though of course since it is quite violent}.
Now for the bad parts let me start off with the acting I'll tell You one thing these people do not know how to act everyone is either going over-the-top or just giving a Dead-Pan Performance.the worst acting comes from Cam'ron.For example the scene where his cousin dies he can't even cry or show real emotion.just fake and bad.the only good acting comes from Funkmaster Flex who disses cam'ron in one scene which was the only funny scene that had me laughing and he ain't even an actor.Juelz Santana who plays Bandana is Bad as well who gives a over-the top performance even though his character is so underdeveloped.
The entire film seemed as though it was made up as he went along, and was pretty much a dull mishmash of gangster movie conventions and clichÃ©s.
Interestingly though, it is probably the plot that has been criticised the most by those not favouring the film.
I still believe that he was sean though....the letters he read couldn't have told him where her husband died.
1-He cheated on his loving wife with psycho (anne heche) 2-He wouldn't leave anna alone even though he knew all he could do was hurt her 3-He was creepy
It doesn't seem as though they feel as connected to each other, everyone has their own personal reality.
I liked the idea of using the local haunt - Mel's Drive-in - as the focal point for the gang's fun even though they actually spend very little time inside it during that night.
It is sad though that interesting stories are ruined by high paid actors.
The direction - though potentially overindulging in montages just a bit - is uniformly superb, allowing the actors free rein to tell the story.
Of course, this story has been shown before but, the talent of the actors make you feel as though you are watching a true life documentary such as, Investigative Reports(Bill Kurtis).
In fact I felt a connection with all of these people even though we come from two different worlds.
What I initially thought of as a kiddie flick, I was pleasantly surprised to find 'Wide Awake' so much more (though I should have known better since it was written by the wonderful M. Night 'Sixth Sense' Shymalan).
Ultimately, though, there are too many silly scenes and stereotypes that end up appearing stupid as opposed to humorous.
For me though Ryan Reynolds stole a lot of the scenes, as he is absolutely hilarious, and it has some great eye candy in Bridgette Wilson and Alyssa Milano, but they also give good performances, plus it's very well made and written.
By no means is this a "chick flick" movie though.
The main selling point of this film though is the story.
These are relatively minor problems though when compared with the rest of the film.
In WWII England a troop of surveyors are dispatched into a characteristically happy-go-lucky and scenic village, though really they are a select assemblage of German officers with orders to seize control of the township on the horizon of a covert German attack in a few days.
Aside from that, though, I found this movie quite enjoyable.
This is all to no avail though as everyone takes their worries to the traitorous squire.
What is interesting though is the subversion of the class system: the dodgy poacher and his little scamp of a sidekick who are the true heroes, where the 'officer class' of the village are portrayed as either incompetent or downright villainous.
The pace continues through the film at such a rate that you do find yourself on the edge of the seat, the acting is great, though some may find the clipped English accent a little annoying, I liked the fact that there are a number of different accents from cockney to Yorkshire all making the "in it together" message more powerful.
Alexander Desplat, the splendid composer of "Birth" starts us off in a such away that I though I was in for a real treat.
Even though film is picks up well from beginning and doesn't allow spectaculars to move from the seat, after some time you can easily predict what will happen next.
Also they have not shown anything happening in the outside world even though policeman in first scene is killed and these 4 friends disappears.
Also all 4 friends looks energetic throughout the life of their characters even though they do not eat or drink anything after their accident...It is one more goof in the film.
His deranged stepfather executes the sheriff that is going to arrest Thomas, and assumes his identity, wearing his clothes, driving his car though the roads in Texas and entitling himself as Sheriff Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey).
I don't want to get into specifics, but there are several parts where the film feels as though it being recycled.
On the whole, though, "Sea Of Love" is a solid and admirably crafted film, well worth your time.
But don't let Kamal's resume of the Jerky Boys fool you; though this is just Nice gun!as creative as any of his spontaneous phone calls, God has a Rap Sheet is not a slapstick comedy.
The others are great though!
Overall, though the plot and theme may seem hackneyed today--and if remade would certainly leave more on the editing floor--the story is skillfully structured, acted and directed and for sure worth a watch by anyone interested in classic movies.
Just one thing wrong though.
There are no longer haunted houses where an ancient curse befell a family -- though I may have to cross that out as JU ON is exactly about that.
Watching the film, it feels completely out of date even though it was 'only' made 7 years ago.
All three of these traits are explored in the movie; though loneliness and alienation are an element of American society as well, they are not nearly as ingrained in our culture as they are in that of the Japanese.
I think this is the only North American release of the film though so you either have to deal or watch dubbing (NEVER WATCH DUBBING!!!)
Still though, it has a certain creepiness and gloom about it, a sense of dread, that comes across rather well.
It seems to pole vault from one scenario to another though, and I will confess to being totally lost sometimes.
A good look and feel to it though, and a scene with a low-flying plane on fire that then crashes out of sight is particularly eerie.
But it is not linear, logical and it doesn't explain everything (it doesn't have to, though).
Even though this film is considered an older J-horror film, it's still fresh in my book.
It holds together, though it is at times a bit confusing.The title is intriguing.
A Rhodesian by birth, Swansey is determined to support the whites as they struggle to retain control in Rhodesia, even though the rest of the world has imposed crippling sanctions on his nation.
In the end it doesn't really matter though.
Apparently closer to the manga than Ichi the Killer was, though I wouldn't know as I haven't seen the manga comic.
Nao Omori returns as the emotionally imbalanced Ichi, though the main character is really Teah from a Miike film the City of Lost Souls.
The film evidently has a smaller budget than Ichi the Killer and some of it seems to have been shot on digi cam, though this just adds to the great look of the film.
The main problem I had with this movie though was the fact that there were no teachers at the school.
The movie is all in Japanese though, so unless you can speak Japanese you'll have to read the English subtitles.
Even though I was disappointed, I still recommend watching this film because of my admiration for Audie Murphy, and to observe a particular attitude about war that was common in 1950s America.
Even though most people wanted the FF series to go back to their roots, taking out the modern edge, I personally enjoyed the fact that it was somewhat modern.
Katzone, though a male character, reminds me of Suzy in GIULIETTA DEGLI SPIRITI (memorably portrayed by Sandra Milo) with the weirdest ideas filled with erotic fantasies.
La CittÃ  Delle Donne is not a grotesque film even though it is rightly considered by many as a crazy little tale of a hapless philanderer.In this film,Italian superstar Marcello Mastroianni appears as if he is more of a morbid widower than one of the resourceful male chauvinists who would do everything in order to prevent weak women from usurping power.Feelini freely talks about the never ending confusion of male female relationships especially in the context of transfer of power.He has made a film which will surely have problems in getting understood by all.It can be surmised that even regular,loyal Fellini fans will have problems trying to figure out the hidden message of this film.
This movie worms its way into your own psyche in time - as with other Fellini movies, it seems to reveal scenes that are totally new and surprising, yet strangely familiar to me even though I've never seen them before.
He gets to the emotional core of human experience, which means that even though I was never a young man who went to a brothel in 1930s Italy, as he has, there is something of the experience that I can relate to, as if it were universal.
But the movie, though flawed and a rehash of some other familiar Fellini themes treated more successfully elsewhere, is also delightful in parts, with a power in the use of visual symbols that I have rarely seen before, even in his own, more overall successful movies.
All in all, this movie is a work of art, playing like a symphony (a bit fractured in the first part though), immersive from the first minute to the last.
As the movie progressed, even though I longed to find out something about this guy, I wasn't getting much at all.
Pretty accurate account of the both greatly admired and violently despised, depending on which side of the fence your sitting on, legendary Cuban, even though he's from Argentina, revolutionary leader Commandante Ernesto Che Guevara, Benicio Del Toro.
Perhaps it's due to Soderbergh and screenwriter Peter Buchman's decision not to show any of our title characters' negative traits whatsoever and only paint him as an heroic figure fighting for the good of the people Â like a Robin Hood figure, so to speak, even though that this is something of a distortion.
Che also spends more time doctoring, reading and tutoring math than engaging the enemy, though he does manage at one point to assert action hero status grabbing a bazooka from an inept subordinate and firing a direct hit.
One must live as though they have already died, then the fear will be gone and you can do what is necessary for the cause.
In the end, though, while the visuals are gorgeous and the acting superb, it is the story that leaves a little something to be desired.
Unfortunately though, I had trouble caring about or even remembering most of the other characters, as dialogue between them isn't particular memorable.
It's all about Del Toro, though.
There's an authentic feel throughout--fortunately Soderbergh made the decision to film in Spanish (though some of the actors, oddly enough in the English segments especially, are wooden).
It's clear that this slogging could have been trimmed down, though it's not so clear what form the resulting film would have taken--but with a little bit of luck it might have been quite a good one.
What kept the movie upbeat though were the scenes of Che in New York giving interviews and addressing the U.N.
The music, though not much of it, was very good and stayed within rhythm of the rest of the film.
Corbucci maintains a furious pace throughout "The Mercenary," even though it starts up with a flashback and sacrifices some suspenseÂbecause you know the principals cannot die until the flashback ends.
When you get down to it though, Corbucci is still really just a simplistic action director who likes explosions, last-minute escapes and indestructible heroes.
Unsurprisingly, Mulot (who tragically drowned in 1986) later dabbled in porn cinema Â though the obscure crime film THE CONTRACT (1971) is considered as his best work.
Overall though, not bad, if kind of derivative.
The youngest (played by Vivian Wu), who thought it was romantic of her sister to elope with Sun though life with him would have been very unstable, yet who had no qualms about standing by her husband in the quest for greater power.
The kids' exploits, though I am certainly not an advocate of them has lost its punch over the years.
Still fun to watch, though.
Even though I would've hated him if I'd known him in school, I now admire the spunk and tenacity of Tanner.
The classical music that goes along with movie is wonderful, even though that might seem to be an odd choice of music for a movie like this.
When he was romancing her mother, Butterworth was training Amanda Whurlitzer (Tatum O'Neill) on pitching and fielding, so that she is a powerhouse (though not as good as a hitter).
I enjoyed watching The Bad News Bears.At first though I didn't want anything to do with it.Seeing as how I'm not really into sports movies, I didn't feel like watching this at all, but I was forced by my friend, who has good taste, and he loved it, so I decided to give it at least 1 viewing.Well, I have to say when the movie started up, I was already dreading it.It just seemed to me to be very boring and plain, and I just kept getting more and more aggravated as the movie continued on.Suddenly, it's like the whole thing changed around.I started getting a bit more entertained, and it sort of changed up from how other sports movies are.I still didn't get what I wanted from The Bad News Bears, but in all fairness this was a really good and original movie, that wasn't as bad as I was thinking it to be.I especially liked the outcome of this movie, for it was very cool, and if you give it a chance like I did, I'm sure you will too.
It always slipped my mind though when I wanted to rent it, but finally I remembered and I am so glad that I got the chance to see it, because this is one of the best comedies to come out of the 70's.
Let me start out by saying that I grew up with Final Fantasy and (even though I dislike most of the games, especially FFVII) the PS1.
That was the most intriguing part though!
Saving Marriage shows the passion these people have for this 'cause' even though it shouldn't be an issue, it was truly heartfelt and is just what we need in our fight for equality.
It gives the viewer both sides of the story (though in truth the opponents of gay marriage border on self-parody) and allows the viewer to make up their own mind.
After time you learn to accept and forget the want to say in front of your loved ones and the world that you are gong to marry the man you love and be able to legally call someone your husband though that is what I call my boyfriend now.
The film itself is very much like the prints in that Harrison does play a rather useless rich jerk, though the ending was quite different.
He's not all riotous living and selfishness, though, as at times he shows a spark of decency.
The always reliable Stockard Channing is also featured as her snobbish sister and Sam Waterston is charming as a man Alley gets involved with but this is Alley's movie and she forsakes any pretense of glamor to realistically portray an unsympathetic character in a difficult situation who somehow still manages to make us feel for her even though we know that a lot of what this woman does and feels is just wrong.
For the most part this is a sunnier and funnier than usual noir, particularly light in tone when the action goes south of the border, and some of this is probably due to the simpler charms of Payne Â no Bogart or Mitchum though effective enough Â but also the screenplay which keeps the hoods and pretend-hood switching guns and one-upping each other often enough that it becomes more than a little comic.
The film's title is misleading, though.
The print I saw was very grainy; this wasn't a studio B movie but one made on the cheap, though the film was distributed by UA.
The plot gets much more intricate than that, though, when it turns out that the boss of the operation, an ex-cop gone bad, is planning to double cross the other members of the team and collect the reward money for himself.
He was planning to spring a trap on them - as though he had solved the robbery himself - and so reclaim his job with the Kansas City police.
The somewhat dated graphics of the actual gameplay don't really detract from the rest of the story, though, so I'll still give them a 9/10.
Final Fantasy VIII's characters feel so human, as though you could walk into a bookstore and run into Quistis, or get served at a cafÃ© by Zell.
Like I said, though, not everyone is going to like it.
My biggest gripe though, is the complete absence of Doom Metal.
Not being a headbanger, per se (though I do like some heavy metal), I found this documentary very informative and interesting.
PS: Cradle Of Filth are NOT Norwegian though ;)
This is a beautifully done movie in every respect, including Max Steiner's music (though a little strong at times), and holds the viewer's interest throughout.
Dunn, of course, has his head totally together, which is how he can go head-to-head with metal legends &/or notorious sorts like Tony Iommi, Bruce Dickinson, Lemmy, Alice Cooper, Dee Snider, Dio and Rob Zombie (Geddy Lee is also among the big known interviewees, though it's strange to see him here when he's not really 'metal', at least in league with these guys).
It's good subjective film-making, though edging a little much on trying to get enough history along with the personal history.
I found Dee Snider of Twisted Sister, Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio of Dio (accredited as the inventor of the devil horn sign) the most compelling interviewees, though there were many others too numerous to mention.
I do like some Aussie things, though.
Beautiful, unspoiled beaches, palm trees, clear turquoise seas obviously photographed through polarizing filters, clear deep blue skies, it makes one think of Polynesia though nothing in the credits gives any indication as to the whereabouts.
Certainly worth viewing for the visual pleasure it exudes, the film is nevertheless less interesting on a plot basis, though the soundtrack is not unpleasant either.
In one, the doctor treats a gunshot victim and doesn't disclose this to the police--even though this violated the law and should have resulted in either criminal prosecution or loss of license or both.
In two others, Kildare behaves like a psychiatrist, even though he has no training in the field and once again, he's right and everyone else is wrong.
Instead of a dime, though, it's thousands per year.
And Fawcett, even though shot through tons of gauze, was certainly not looking her best, but everyone kept saying how she was soooo beautiful and talented and gorgeous.
Having just watched this early '90s suspense thriller about computer hackers (I think) for the first time, I was partially confused about some scenes though overall, I was a little entertained by some of the comedy elements that were sprinkled throughout.
It was also good seeing Redford and Sidney Poitier in their only team-up though technically Poitier was supporting here.
The acting is good for all the parts(in spite of Kingsley's inexplicable and seemingly random occasional change of accent) and the characters are good(Aykroyd amuses with his portrayal of a conspiracy nut, though he's never over the top).
As my fiancÃ©e pointed out while we watched it, fans of J.J. Abrams' hit series Alias will appreciate the elaborate planning and execution of the "sneaks"(though it is not as stylized), and there is some gadgetry.
I recommend this to any fan of spy flicks(though I'm not sure people expecting action or mystery in this will find themselves satisfied... and as a thriller, it's light at best).
Watching it a second time gives you a sense of perspective though.
There is some solid acting, and though there are sub-plots within the main plot, they do not grow so much so as to overwhelm the main storyline, which is basically a group of men hired to find the chip-that-controls-everything.
It's even worse than the old Battlestar Galactica series, though not by much!
Maya the shape-shifting alien, though well acted by Catherine Schell, is a terrible idea (good on paper, not on screen), with makeup different in every episode and then the tendency to transform only into Earth animals.
It balances though in many aspects the old -Orpheus- myths of the travels via the under-worlds to the finding of secret treasures, so precious the conductor should resign his fears: Europe, as you know, is a derivative of the old Indo-Europeans, enemies to Egypt, the Ancient Gnostic Civilization.
Cheers: Groundbreaking effects, fine acting, some good scripts, serious drama though fun.
I think you could have discussion about the meaning of some episodes as though you were discussing a Bunuel film.
Space 1999 was a giant leap for mankind closer to reality than Lost In Space, Star Trek, The Starlost, though I treasure those series as well for what they offered.
The second season was arguably though, the most exciting, with upbeat music and lots of action, the flaw being that some of the scripts were pretty poor.
Meanwhile back home she has been notified of this tragic news and manages to deal with it bravely even though she is going to have his child.
I loved the denouement, though.
The script writing was extremely poor too and it's not hard to see why Peter Noone kept to music (though he did get an early start as Len Fairclough's son in the long running British Soap Coronation Street)
The gore isn't nearly as effective as most other films in this genre either, though there's plenty of blood being flung around.
Here it's replaced by a woman merely tied to a pole, which isn't too shocking, though the film crew acts as if it is.
The ending is a carbon copy of the ending of CH, though not nearly as effective.
From the trailers, the website even the promotion it looked as though it was definitely for guys.
The twins are well cast even though they are from illinois and Errol Flynn is always entertaining as the swashbuckling hero.
In the slums of 16th century London, young Billy Mauch (as "Pauper" Tom Canty) makes the most of his life as a beggar; though, he is beaten by his father, and thrown in the mud.
Now, even though this stuff if supposed to kill him (and was probably supposed to kill everyone they shot it into), one of the thugs says that he's heard some 'bad' stuff about the drug, that it can make you really strong.
A drug that's been made to kill people has supposedly made people strong, even though it's made to kill them.
There's a very generous amount of gore, though the make-up effects themselves vary in quality from pretty decent to chintzy.
I am in love with some of things in this film though.
Notice that in a series of death scenes in the same room all take place in a curiously clean space, even though someone died brutally in the same spot not five minutes before.
The special effects are horrendous though.
There is no excuse for the filmmakers to have been satisfied with the amount of bad acting in this movie (though the lead, Aaron Gaffey, isn't half bad).
Sure the CGI in the climax is kind of laughable by today even though back then it was a little cheap and the storyline is very compelling as well as the old school type of animation here.
Killing Golgo 13, though, is no easy task at all.
And although this is what many people would just think of as an animation, there are performances that actually seem as though they are real.
The flashback technique, though well executed in this movie, does nothing to enhance the story, or the viewer's understanding of the film, unless of course the director wanted to that merely to keep the audience off balance.
It was scary with the kills even though it had slasher movie kills the plot kept you guessing who it was instead of knowing it's some guy from a lake with a hockey mask and no life.
The movie wasted Clea DuVall's talent though with that small role.
Now he seems as though he has watched too many Sylvester Stallone movies ( and this may be the case as we see a poster for Cobra and Rambo hanging in Billy's house ).
The direction and plot had you puzzled, i realy do not understand why the bodies all vanished though, (yes i know it was within malcom's mind) and does anyone else think that timothy looked shifty from the beginning?
Even though I wasn't as enraptured in suspense this time, one is still drawn into the film by the gradual quickening and spiraling of loss of control experienced by the characters.
"Beverly Hills Cop II" tries to be stylish but can't even though it's in the hands of Tony Scott, director of 1986's "Top Gun".
Too bad TCM didn't get this for their retrospective on Hutton films a few years ago - it's one of her best even if she does play second fiddle to Lamour (though she holds her own).
Teaming up with his colleagues from the first film, Axel goes "deep undercover" to bring the perps to justice though not without indulging the viewer with a glorified view of Eighties California.
Very intelligent though not quite as funny as Curb, the show is a fine depiction of how The inner circle of DC uses the media to get their message to the masses.
This was a very good match though.
The music is especially good even though I can't understand what the words are.
Not as good as the origanal though but very entertaining.
The two films are similar, though, on some plot points.
Also, even though everyone gave an appealing performance, I liked Dennis' (Mason Gamble) the best.
It gets a little cheesy at times though, like when he gets into the bad guys' office by pretending to be a delivery boy delivering highly unstable plutonium capsules in - get this - a brown paper bag, but overall it stays in the same vein as the original and may even be better in a lot of ways.
The 2 main villains are very menacing, even though we hardly see Jurgen Prochnow, he was still very menacing when on screen.
Allen Garfield is very good here, but he was EXTREMELY unlikable,, and yelled to much and i just wanted to slap him!, he did his job well though.
If I had my way, Every copy of this film would be melted down and the plastic used to do something useful, though the aura of fail surrounding the film would doubtless taint whatever product was made with it, possibly compelling all within a hundred feet to use stilted dialogue and be utterly unconvincing-I was very aware I was watching a film at all times, and an awful film at that.
And even though Orson Welles rarely played the romantic lead, he's wonderful.
It is also the best, though Murder on the Blackboard is also top notch.
Miss Withers was one of the first screen characters to build on "the little old lady" detectives first introduced by Mary Roberts Rinehart and later to be highly polished - though with fewer comic overtones - in Agatha Christie's Miss Marple tales.
Even though at that age she was too young to understand all of it, the shapes and colors made her smile and laugh.
The boy who played Nat was pretty good, and he gave me the odd feeling I had seen him before, though I have no idea where.
I most liked Dan though.
I have not succeeded but even though I have viewed many bad films some of which would of been to bad even for the crew of The Satellite of Love.
Kind of post-apocalyptic, though it's not clear where they come from or whether there is any purpose for being there.
No problem, though, as there are tons of other absurd elements to enjoy.
David Dhawan in 1999 after the superhit BIWI NO.1 with Salman repeated Salman and Karisma for the 4th time in his film with this film which released 2 months after the not so successful DHLJ  The movie is the same formula Salman, Karisma and Dutt have done for ages Similar to SAAJAN minus there Sanjay was the lead and he had a great role here he is just the typical no nonsense kinda boss who falls in love Even the music is ordinary here and also the romance  It's like 9 years after SAAJAN you make a diluted version which looks like a rehash of several other films   The film is nothing different and is actually boring to watch Remember DILLAGI, Remember SAAJAN.etc  Direction by DD is bad Music is nothing special  Amongst actors Salman does his usual stuff he did mostly those days though he was more lively and natural compared to today's comedies of his where he is bad Sanju seems bored Karisma does her part very well Dalip Tahil is okay Shakti Kapoor, Himani are routine Sushma Seth is good
After Schumann's death, with the help of Brahms, she continued to do concerts though plagued by various ailments.
It really is amazing though how much effort must have gone into the writing of the lines for this movie.
Also, the action scene's were decent too, though the chase with the cement truck was'nt as good as the chase in the first with the transport truck.
Even though it's a comedy movie the story line is pretty good.
There are two distinct reasons that this comedy stands the test of multiple views, though.
Years later they teamed up with Carrey again to film "Me Myself and Irene," which was a great movie, but even though the movie was nastier, even though it contained a chicken up a filthy pig's ass, it still couldn't match the wonderful grossness Peter, Bobby, Jim & Jeff provided in one of the funniest films in cinema history.
Dumb & Dumber takes a good story, adds some tear-inducing comedy, some endlessly hilarious dialogue ("I guess they're right, old people, though slow and dangerous behind the wheel, can still serve a purpose.
Unlike these, though the movie tries to be sentimental, on most parts it is cold.
The best thing, though, is Bruno Ganz, the great German actor who is on hand to impress us with his own take on the grandfather.
Unlike Rick, he can neither reveal his identity or his love for the woman he left behind -- even though she may know it.
'Joshua' has a good, ironic sense of its eastern urban white milieu, and though it may fizzle away a bit at the end, it does make you genuinely uncomfortable.
This could be rather fun for a young viewer, though some American critics have found this charming story "simplistic" or "sappy."
Theo Gheorghiu is excellent, though, and it is fun to support his character Vitus, once you have found out that he is fooling everyone.
What a great movie to come out of Switzerland, though for those who have followed Fredy Murer's career this shouldn't come as much of a surprise.
It was also the country's official Acadamy Award entry for best foreign language film (though it didn't win).
The fighting scenes were sometimes unrealistic, though the gun with two bullets actually had only two bullets in it.
In general, I was positively impressed, though the end left a lot to be desired.
The flight attendant caught in all the fighting acted quite well, even though her role was quite irritating at times.
Helen's character Mary could GET on the audience's nerves as well, even though she was a good person & meant well.
Problems don't stop there though.
It's pretty messed up though.
Black Cat fails to be great even though it is made in Hong Kong, where action films are usually unmatchable.
Even though we know throughout the whole movie that he eventually gets killed (which the movie doesn't show), we always root for him.
A lot of what one sees after that as this "thing" moves about the countryside are nothing more than color reversals and nothing great, though.
They can't cram everything into one final hour, even though the audience expects them too.
Nor is it about having enough film savvy or cleverness to figure out obscure themes and subplots in films, after all, some of us are David LYNCH fans and enjoy decoding and detangling films as though they are mazes.
Even though I have said that this movie is like "The Usual Suspects" it is different and takes it to a higher level.
The actors all do their jobs just fine, though I think LL Cool J was somewhat miscast.
The second is a gang whose members don't die very easily and their alien leader, though no one seems to really care or notice that he's an alien.
The rather ham-fisted editing further adds to confusion, with sequences ending to suddenly, settings changing without proper establishment, and events being referred to which the audience never saw take place (though, this may be since I saw an incomplete version).
2 of 10 stars, Scott didn't make all that many truly great movies in his career, but I certainly remember the ones he did do, this one wont be remembered as one though.
The story though very simple and common it is told in a most humble way (Just for instance the reason soldier want a break from war to visit his mother is to take care of the leaking roof that she wrote about in a letter), possibly very few movies are this strikingly simple.
A park is strafed by Cylon ships, and a small dog is killed (though the actual death is not shown, so we are left with some hope).
Soon enough, our heroes have forgotten all about the genocide: Starbuck tries to get it on with two equally boring women, and Apollo enters into a creepy relationship with the little boy whose dog was maybe killed (though it might be slightly less creepy if you consider he was only trying to sleep with Jane Seymour, the boy's mother).
The film end so a series can take off and though I watched it as a kid I don't remember that all that well.
Starbuck impersonates everything a boy wants to be (he's so damn cool), and I still go by the codename Starbuck today, though (or maybe because) I am totally different.
Even though the battle sequences are always the same (they always get the Cylon in the middle, njahahaha)...  And yes, I hate the kid and the robot-dog as well.
* the casting:  ---> Lorne Greene as Adama brings a commanding screen presence  ---> Richard Hatch as Apollo is well-cast and believable as a leader/captain of a fighter wing  ---> Dirk Benedict as Starbuck the amiable sarcastic sidekick   ---> John Colicos as Baltar oozed evil with perfection  ---> other minor cast members like Herbert Jefferson Jr as Boomer and Terry Carter as Colonel Tigh were very well cast too  ---> I thought the three most visible female characters were all good, though not standout.
But even though she wants to be an adult it is just like a game for her, because actually she behaves like a kid because she IS a kid.
Even though the nudes in this movie are tame, they are nudes after all and I don't think a girl that age feels comfortable being nude in a cinema production set with 20-30 people around looking at her, not to mention the things she has to say or to do with men in the movie.
This made more sense, though: they wanted to keep their bloodline pure.
The nudity, by the way, does not take place during any love scenes, though at one point there is nudity after one.
The implications raised in the picture are the sort that would probably get shot down in flames by the 'Religious Right, though mostly around the Brooke Shields character.
She's used to it all though, and Shields plays this character with total bravery- I almost wonder how much she was told of it all, and what she brought as intuition or having to just know the state of mind of her all-too-young character.
Shields plays it right though, and her range of emotions for the character is actually stunning, and almost makes Sarandon keep up with what's going on.
Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode.
They still wear their black outfits and wreak havoc on the unsuspecting population, though.
"Beau-PÃ¨re" is not a skin flick, though the cover of the DVD and VHS would make you think otherwise.
So powerful to me, at least, that I have only watched it one other time and have little desire to see it again.....even though it's a fine movie.
It's also quite remarkable how the script never reverts to being gratuitous exploitation, even though all the themes hint towards that direction.
Even though I played it with the graphics turned down on my old 486 I consider it one of my favorite games.
It was also cool to see Thomas F. Wilson (who played Biff Tannen in the "Back To The Future" trilogy) playing one of the good guys for a change, even though his character, Lt. Todd "Maniac" Marshall, and Col. Blair are rivals, and only sometimes friends with each other.
Don't say that to his face, though.
OK OK--his wife had left him but still... After the first season though the series picked up speed and just got better and better.
Contrary to Married with children (which is also an extremely funny and smart show), it depicted the ethics that most of the families miss today - ethical parents, democrats, charity loving and enjoy the bonds they have and though they play it so safe during the whole show, they still got you laughing in a joyous way.
In conclusion, even though it can also be seen on Nick at Nite now, I strongly recommend you catch it before it goes off the air for good.
Or though the episodes were only 30 minutes long, the comedy it provided was excellent.
Pity Tina Yothers stopped acting as it is amazing what a quantity and quality of dialogue she delivered at a very young age (though the jury is still out on her real age).
I did laugh a few times though, but it didn't fit!
This wasn't a black comedy though it could have been one hell of a genius black comedy if they changed a few things.
I will say this though.
Mankiewicz works this inner problem out on the screen well, though choosing to keep the camera at a distance, as if filming a play sometimes, not a recommended film noir method for style, but it does emphasize the psychology more discretely.
John Hodiak is good, though perhaps encouraged to overdo the vacant looks even when the amnesia plot seems to have been forgotten.
I suspect "The Maltese Falcon" must have provided the model for this dark mystery, though enough cosmetic surgery has been performed to disguise the features of the original mold.
These semi-noir mysteries were not his forte, though he made another one of them and that one, "No Way Out," was pretty damned good.
But as he skulks though the city's dark demimonde (Turkish baths, mobbed-up nightclubs, phony spiritualist parlors, insane asylums), he's quick to learn that other people don't want Cravat found.
Cravat proves both elusive and uncomfortably close....  Somewhere In The Night boasts a strong cast in supporting (Conte, Nolan, Fritz Kortner) and even tertiary roles (Sheldon Leonard, Whit Bissell, Henry Morgan, with special mention to Josephine Hutchinson, who plays a poignant largo midway though the movie).
Young Freddie Highmore is sharp and charming, though narrow in expression.
Then August, whose only been in NYC for a little while is able to run through subway systems, find his way to Central Park and get access to back stage where they have a tux and tails waiting for him even though he was not supposed to show.
Are you saying she gave birth to a baby in a US hospital, did not have to sign one form to have it given away even though she is over 18, not one nurse or doctor said anything about the baby's health or showed it to her and there was no funeral for a supposed dead baby???
But seriously though: This movie is bloody violent (pun intended)!
I liked this element of the movie, though, as it requires you to read between the lines.
Story: 9/10 I liked this story though it was not so complex which it wasn't meant to be.
Flash-forward twenty years and Colbert and Brent have two sons, the first one actually Welles', though this is kept secret.
Lisa Marie is hot though.
For the most part the gay plot lines are pretty reasonable and believable though not very compelling.
It also has many plot twists, and though it has be commented upon that it is too predictable, I thought nothing of the sort.
Please, forget the cotton-candy version that has Morgan Freeman in the cast (though, I _adore_ Stockard Channing).
See them both--though similar, you just can't get enough of these crazy cartoons and they abound with great humor and animation throughout.
The one nice person in the film is a daughter who defends her father even though (unknown to her) he tries to sell her into prostitution.
I picked up Jane Austen's book Pride & Prejudice while in high school and I couldn't make myself get past the first chapter... that and the fact that I don't typically like period dramas (they usually aren't done too well), I was hesitant when a friend casually mentioned that it was good, though long.
(The Keira Knightley version has its own charms here and there, but overall was a big disappointment to purists and was not historically accurate at all, though Donald Sutherland did add a surprising sweetness to Mr. Bennet - a nice if not faithful interpretation.)
Mrs Bennet, though annoying, is wonderful, and Mr. Bennet, witty and sarcastic, a perfect choice....in short, the complete cast has so decidedly imprinted upon my image of the characters that I find it hard to imagine anyone else playing that particular role.
The central message of the story which I found personally educational is the moment when Elizabeth, having thought herself an excellent judge of human character, while reading Darcy's letter realizes that she has entirely deceived herself with regards to the character of both Wickham and Darcy and that this self deception has resulted from vanity, because Wickham flattered her whereas Darcy insulted her with his "She is tolerable I suppose, though not handsome enough to tempt me."
It was almost perfect - though not quite.
there is a little swearing in the film, which somehow warranted an 'r' rating even though there is much less swearing and less objectionable material than most 'pg-13' flicks (if you let your kids watch pg-13, let 'em watch this.)
It gets old quick sometimes though, as there's Sean and Alan and then the respective conservative and liberal guests all going off at once yelling at each other like a bunch of third graders.
All in all though, the debate can be quite interesting sometimes as they often have relevant guests discussing relevant issues, but all too often they end up in shouting matches that aren't exactly conducive to an intelligent discussion.
The scenery was nice, though.
Surely though, that represents evolution taking its course.
"Let's declare a vendetta against the supergator even though I have no stated reason for so doing!"
Each room, each character is so amazingly designed, you feel as though you are watching a movie with real actors.
This revisits areas from the previous incarnation, though they do new things with them.
I did make it though, barely.
The sound mixing was okay, though it felt like everything was ADR'd and foleyed.
The movie is touted (on the DVD box), as akin to the Blair Witch Project, though it bears no resemblance to that film - it is a blatant, flat-out-obvious rip off of "Relic".
I like how even though it has SO much slapstick, there is always a teeny bit of wit to top it off!
The music though was fantastic, very rousing.
The 13 stories cover everything from evil doppelgangers to Satanists; witches; ghosts; 'voodoo dolls'; werewolves; cannibals and more besides (no vampires though, something of a departure for Hammer!)
So even though this movie gets pretty gory and violent, visually Id say its very elegant.
Although it doesn't quite achieve the emotional resonance, thematic depth, and ingenious creativity of a true miniseries masterpiece like "Six Feet Under" (though, at times, it comes close), "The Best of Youth" still offers much to hold the viewer's attention throughout its exhaustive (though never exhausting) length.
The plot is good, though, I believe they could've done a better job, some plot points aren't as good as they could be, and some parts of the plot have been overreacted, especially the sad parts, some other (better parts) of the plot flash by, which is a pity.
With possible exceptions of Nicola's mother and perhaps his too-young-yet, barely formed though marriageable, daughter, Mirella seems the sanest creature in the film, Fate's gift to this at least slightly askew family.
Despite the cop stuff, the look, the gun, I don't think he's political (they could have involved him against Nicola's terrorist love but don't; Nicola though, by surviving so wholeheartedly within the status quo does come off political).
"Best of Youth" is being released in the U.S. in movie theaters, though I'm not sure even shown in two parts of three hours each how edited it is from the original format, as other grand European mini-series like "Berlin Alexanderplatz," "Das Boot" and "Fanny and Alexander" were originally only shown in the U.S. in truncated theatrical versions as even PBS seems averse to television with subtitles so we rarely get to see the best of world television.
Watching it is a wonderful way of getting a feel for Italian history in the last 40 years, though without ever feeling like you're watching a dense, academic "historic" film.
In another fantastic documentary, "Born into Brothels," one of the children says something to the effect of "I like this picture, though it is sad, we have to look at it because that is the way she lives and it is truth."
Even though he was betrayed by the UN and ignored by the rest of the world, he emerged from this terrible situation as a hero.
A Quiet Place to Kill is not be confused with the earlier Orgasmo, though unfortunately confusing the pair is very easy as they're from the same director, both feature American actress Carroll Baker and they were both released under the title 'Paranoia'!
For she comes to see her real challenge is that she cannot relate to Ned even though she loves him very much.
I caught this on City TV last night (Feb 16th, 2008) when flipping through the channels, and even though I had missed the first 30 minutes of this film, I was compelled to stop on that channel and watch it!
Also, when the film cuts to the final scene, where Julie's pregnancy is obviously going along nicely, and even though their son's death is imminent, they appear to be a reunited, happy family again.
But, even though I seem to prefer a film that "spells it all out" for me, I loved this film BECAUSE it begged all of those questions, BECAUSE it left me pondering, wondering, thinking, worrying...
I was initially skeptical about this film as I've never been a big fan of Claire Daines, and though I've always found Billy Crudup attractive, I've never thought of him as a great actor, especially one that could convincingly portray a man who in many ways identifies himself as a woman.
Since then, I have seen it three more times, and have concluded that even though it does not have a technically typical or logical resolution and plot, it is so rife with talented performances, excellent directing and powerful messages that the seemingly empty conclusion must be overlooked.
The message, though, I think, is that everything has a consequence.
When Julie returns to Canada, she finds that her father's bride has left him alone, though not before leading her son to a complete recovery.
There are plenty of units and associated gib effects to make up for that though.
The three sides are remarkable in how even they are(though it should be noted that the way they are set up is essentially an idea from earlier RTS titles, including StarCraft), and all have some interesting stuff to play around with, as well as an arsenal that makes them formidable foes, and satisfying to play as.
The level design is good, but for only having seven missions per side, few of them are terribly memorable(though there are some interesting scenarios, such as providing cover-fire for retreating US troops, and all three sides get a reasonably satisfying finale).
For one thing, I've seen more than one film with the name "Anthony Dawson" on the credits, so I know that a lot of his films aren't even this amusing (though a handful are even moreso).
It almost appears as though Nick will die, but there will be a new life in the family.
While overall his film is the most wholly satisfying and entertaining, it's not without a heap of 'hip' shots, like the one that pulls back (via computers of course, though very cleverly) across the set of a movie being shot, or in some of those angles that one saw as being one-of-a-kind in Park's Oldboy.
Atmosphere this time trumps perversity, though it still applies that Miike's film is a work that will be probably more haunting because of the complexities to how Kyoko faces what's happened to her sister Soko.
The second story, "Cut", also straight-forward, might be the weaker of the three even though it has some very tense moments: a director finds himself hostage to a situation with an actor who was little more than an extra, his wife attached to a piano like a puppet, and a child strapped against a sofa.
Something a bit different then just having your average day killer going around killing teenagers, though I don't mind a dose of that every now and again.
Do see this trilogy though.
Great ending, though.
CUT had a good story and a decent amount of gore (though nothing "too" out-there...)and really just needs to be viewed to be "understood".
It's a good idea though and not without social interest and it has to be said the grossest of the three.
I watched all three on separate occasions, fearing that otherwise they might blur into one another - no fear of that though so I'll watch them again soon, all together.
This film was to be Dirty Harry's last outing in the seventies (do not worry though, he had two comebacks in the eighties).
This is not the only thing that has stayed the same though.
Almost as important as the case against the terrorists is the city politics where the mayor and chief of police wish to talk up Harry and Kate's role just to further their equal opportunities policies even though they had no role in the arrest they are getting the credit for.
Mostly, though, it gives the audience a chance to share vicariously in the triumph of good over evil, as Harry once again metes out justice in his own inimitable way.
This film was to be Dirty Harry's last outing in the seventies (do not worry though, he had two comebacks in the eighties).
This is not the only thing that has stayed the same though.
It is 1) unrealistic that Irene Dunn, missing at sea for seven years, should reappear on the very day that husband, Cary Grant, has succeeded in having her declared dead and then, moments later, remarried in the same courtroom and 2) that Grant's mother would not have attended the wedding; presumably the writers needed Dunne's mother-in-law to be in when Dunne (who naturally would not have known about the new wedding so would have no reason to attend and try to stop it) resurfaced though a little thought could have solved this.
It is also my opinion that Irene Dunne was a more natural comedienne than she was a singer...good voice though she had.
It's interesting that even though Randolph Scott makes the obligatory declaration that, despite being on an island alone with Irene Dunne for 7 years, nothing happened, Dunne never validates this.
It's a well written story that offers plenty of surprises with its moments and main plot-line, even though of course the movie in a sense is mostly predictable, just like any other genre movie.
McCarey still served as the writer and producer of the movie though, so his touch is still notable within the movie.
Cary Grant and Irene Dunne were great together, and though "My Favorite Wife" is not as funny as "The Awful Truth," it's still pretty good.
I do feel sorry for Gail Patrick though.
It seems as though he's been taken to the cleaners by one of his bettors and though it hurts he has to pay off.
The scene moves so damn slow, even though it is supposed to be scary.
The characters are fun, and even though they've been done a million times, you still like them, plus they're very real.
I've seen some obscure horror films too, like Blood Beach, The Company Of Wolves and even seen The Last House On the left (even though I didn't like it that much).
I had to give this TV movie a ranking here in order to review it, though it's no fair using the same metric as with the theatrical Bonds.
Apparently there was more to the ending that I missed, though it seemed to have run its course well enough.
Since this was on American television, though, Bond's nationality was changed so he became Jimmy Bond, a Yank.
The small cast works well together, even though the acting gets appropriately too theatrical at times for my taste.
So even though the ending is a bit too tame (Fleming's torture from the book would never have reached TV audiences from 1954), the mini-movie makes up for it with a tense battle at the card table, some good acting, and a great espionage feel throughout.
We've seen it all before, though fortunately rarely in such a mindblowingly slooow pace and without virtually any story or message behind it.
I was a bit puzzled though by the facial damage on a person who had'nt been to the match.
I have to say though, this is by far the worst movie I have seen, or at least, I can recall seeing.
It all goes to show that Williams, like good wine, travels well, even though in this case it was from planet to planet.
The gore is pretty amateurish, though plentiful.
I may be a little biased though... but that just means you should watch it for yourself and see what you think!
It's rather straightforward, even though the script does throw around many scientific exchanges but counterpointing that is many trashy dialogues.
Although it did get hard to see with moments of hectic editing techniques (though some odd inclusions added something different), dim lighting composition and fuzzily intrusive photography.
She should have been nominated for an award of some kind, though exactly which variety I am unsure.
Directed by William A. Levey, who also appears in the film as the severed head in the fridge, I though Hellgate was crap.
It's a pretty strange little film, though compared to the rest of the short films from the Kino Video Avant Garde collection, it's pretty "normal" and approachable for the average viewer.
I gotta say, though, that the inventive camera-work is pretty cool and the film is in many ways like a piece of Pop Art.
My parents got me a Julia "Barbie" doll, even though I did not have any regular Barbie dolls.
He can take a man's pocket watch, even though newly cleaned, and determine that the owner was poor but had come from a well-off family, that he had periods of income but they never lasted, that he was an alcoholic and that he was descending into madness.
(Burnett writes as though she is being paid by the word and puts in way to many adjectives.)
A bigger challenge for the boy to overcome though is to bring down the barrier between his stubborn, set in his ways grandfather and Ceddie's mother "Dearest" (Dolores Costello), who the Earl resents his son marrying as she's an American.
Seriously, though.
Director John Cromwell worked a lot with the great and powerful producer David O.Selznick and seems largely to have been content to follow his instructions,though he was always loath to allow too much sentimentality as happen on the sometimes heavily relationship between mother-son and grandfather-grandson.
There are plenty of negative aspects though.
Cushing plays out that moment brilliantly by providing us that even though he's an honourable man that can take it on the chin, but that moment he gives us a small glimpse of remorse and to question his own actions, which makes you feel for him a bit.
Pleasence, though who did play Rose's character like a puppet, really gets your skin crawling, especially with his sly nature, body movement and reactions to when performing these callous acts.
Solid, well-crafted but rather patchy cinematic treatment of the saga of notorious 19th Century "Resurrectionists" Burke and Hare and their unorthodox employer Dr. Robert Knox; in the vein of Hammer horror (featuring two of their most notable participants in Cushing and Gilling) though the lack of color makes it seem a half-hearted attempt (even if, with an eye on the low-budget, it was probably a conscious choice by the film-makers as the intentions were clearly of a serious undertaking)!
The film makes a fine, though essentially unpleasant, companion piece to the more literate and subtle THE BODY SNATCHER (1945); the theme was again handled (by another horror veteran, Freddie Francis) a quarter of a century later in THE DOCTOR AND THE DEVILS (1985) - while Gilling himself had contributed to the script of an earlier variation, THE GREED OF WILLIAM HART (1948), starring Tod Slaughter!
Image's DVD also includes the "Continental Version" which contains about a minute of more explicit violence and nudity (in the many tavern sequences) - though this only helps render it even more unsavory than it already is!
It's pretty good, too, though not-as-good as this.
This spate of murders doesn't seem to concern Knox too much, even though he suspects that Burke and Hare are the culprits.... so engrossed is he in his experiments that he is happy to turn a blind eye.
Eventually Burke and Hare are captured for their crimes, the latter testifying against his accomplice to save his skin (though he is later pursued and blinded by a hateful mob), while - most disturbing of all - the cruel and calculating Dr. Knox is ultimately pardoned for his own part in the affair.
Any which way though, I gave this movie a favorable rating.
It's not really a criticism, though -- most movies start with a great premise and have trouble resolving it.
But it is a very entertaining film, though I wouldn't watch it with a kid under the age of 15, however jaded by the media today's youths may seem to be.
Beverley, happily married to dentist Eugene with two teenage children, Chip and Misty, lives in an affluent, idyllic suburb which looks as though it has been taken from a fifties sit-com.
Even after 15 years, this movie is still pretty much amazing, even though it's surely not as half as shocking as it was before.
Waters fans should also watch for cameos /small roles by Alan Wendel, Traci Lords, Susan Lowe, Mary Vivian Pearce (I only recognized her from her distinctive voice) and though he doesn't appear in the credits, Waters manages to work in Don Knotts.
Although this movie is in French and dubbed in English, the most important thing required to enjoy this movie is using the English subtitles even though the speech is in English...the voice over seems to be competing with the background movie sound (rain, music) so it is difficult to make out the conversations without it.
Doesn't work that easy though.
i do believe they made a very hasty end though,i wanted a bigger part of the movie to happen in Instanbul.
apart from that i believe its a very good movie the best part of it,has to be the atmosphere created,especially in the beginning   when the movie ended i had the same feeling i had with "bone collector" and "takin lives" (i adored both of them) i really think "the empire of the wolves" has the standards to compete with these two great movies  the political edge though makes the latter stand out in my opinion.
This is not a simple re-do though on an old plot.
The only problem is there was the big film- "The Devil's Advocate" with Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino- (totally different plot though) so it may confuse the viewer, thinking these are similar films, and thus, not tuning in.
Still technically being Joe's lawyer Abe feels that he can't betray his client even though his client betrayed him.
Jones is indeed superb, and though the premise is somewhat far-fetched, it is not important, because the drama remains.
This is upsetting to Joe and Kate, though they try to put their best face on it: Ann is the daughter of jailbird Herb Deever.
Sanders Of The River though incredibly dated should be seen quite frankly because of that.
They slowly begin to lose that veneer of civilization that they though only they possessed, the same patina these embattled locals once had, but lost long ago.
This cartoon is great for teenagers and adults, though; they are also the ones who may actually understand the homages to horror writers or older cartoons that may go over the heads of little kids.
Even though I was too young to have ever seen the O.C.
The potty humor can be a bit overused, though.
Most importantly though are the stars, especially the brilliant Sheila E. who I now have a crush on.
I could go on forever about the movie and even though the movie was low budget, poorly edited, complimented with sub par acting, it is the memories that are evoked that makes me like it.
In Emperor's Club, Prof Hundert loses his spot as headmaster to a young, politically-connected upstart, even though he taught there for 30 years.
Part of the ending bothered me, to avoid spoilers I wont go into why, though the final scene certainly made up for it.
The only thing stopping me from giving it a full 10, was the fact that I didn't like the ending very much, even though the suicide was a shock, the whole thing about Mr Keating getting kicked out didn't entertain me at all.
It does, though, has some really wonderful lines, and it is a complete self-indulgent hedonistic piece of nonsense.
Everyone was sad when he died, and though the other boys had their 'Tiffs' he wanted everyone to be friends.
Williams is excellent as always though and for seventy five percent of the time, Dead Poets Society is a great film.
Robert Sean Leonard comes off best as the doomed student, though his suicide seems remarkably undermotivated.
Thanks to Peter Weir's efficient direction and some nice cinematography, DEAD POETS SOCIETY has a facade of class; but only if you don't pay too close attention to Tom Schulman's dreadful (though Oscar-winning) script.
How you look, how others look... how you think, how you feel... and a warning to never, ever become conformist (though being conformist about walking is perhaps slightly exaggerated).
A few hours ago I felt lonely and depressed.I decided to watch it without the scenes that evoke sadness.And even though I watched it so many times before I found it restorative and heart lifting.
The point really driven home by the movie though is to stand up for one's beliefs throughout all of life no matter how hard it may prove.
The horror anthology angle is interesting though, and all three of the stories shown have effective moments.
Great title though!
but originals on VHS do exist, though any DVD is a bootleg as of this writing.
Im sure some of it is my youth perspective in 1979 but I think its in the class of something like Legend of Boggy Creek which is a classic because it brought something new though campy as all heck.
That's another story though.
One of the more interesting things for me in this 1950 film was it's explanation of the terms "contract" and "hit", obviously recent additions to the crime lexicon for it's day, though hardly unknown today.
That was one of the credibility defying scenes that seemed a little over the top, even though done in understated fashion.
One of Bogie's last films, it holds up well, even though certain elements mentioned earlier mark it as a period piece.
The opening sequence remains a riveting case study in wild-eyed fear, as Rico (de Corsia) sweats a bucket load even though he's safely behind police walls.
The film's finale is handled well though, and a basement gangland meeting is suitably ominous.
And though seemingly all of his witnesses have been murdered or otherwise neutralized, we see a way for Bogart to eventually prosecute his protagonist.
Literally one of the darkest of noir films, though not everyone's favorite it seems.
but there would be little point in that as you would only be missing the point of the sheer silliness and entertainment that this film delivers (i really did love the bit with the teeth though!)
What made this movie to Cann, and winning the Canadian film festival is, it bold production design, Very Brave to be difference, It also does capture and show beautiful scene though, While I was seeing this movie I just fell like I was in a real stage theater.
The acting is good and though seem sometime artificially serve the film to the point.
Much of the film appears to be set in the early 1960s, though its outlaws are strictly of the American Wild West variety (albeit with hand-held rocket launchers).
Oddly, though set in present day Thailand, the characters dress and behave like cowboys, which - if nothing else - allows Sasanatieng to reference his favorite films and filmmakers (most notably the works of Sergio Leone and Sam Peckinpah), and the director's bold visual assurance prevents the whole thing from sliding into obscurity.
Unlike PO though, TOTBT is not just utterly removed from filmic convention - it's just in utterly the wrong time and place.
The two best though, are Fai, a classic machine gun and vest bad guy who has the films funniest shot in his first shootout - look out for it, its quite subtle - and Mahesuan, Dum's right-hand man, who has the best evil laugh EVER, using it whenever he gets the chance, also one half of an inspired shootout or two.
Even though there are a bunch of very brutal scenes, the level of sleaze and violence is quite low for a Jess Franco film, and the film is not even nearly as nasty as other popular 'Hexploitation' films of the time, such as the ultra-gruesome "Mark Of The Devil" from the same year.
"The Bloody Judge" is definitely one of his better films (even though, in my opinion, not one of his masterpieces), and a more than decent historical horror film.
Poor Rudy had little to do except look beautiful though!
Eventually the real duke shows up and even though he knows she is not the same woman he had a fling with he still wants Mae.
With The Wind And The Lion, Rough Riders feels as though Milius has a deep and abiding love for Theodore Roosevelt.
Highly on the marketing though.
A mysterious military officer (Boxleitner) with a pistol and a lunchbox is strangely uninterested in working with the others even though he appears to know much he isn't telling.
Jeff Alexander's music is nothing special, though the theme song is vibrant.
I won't say anything about the plot (even though there is not one) but I will say something about the dazzling, state-of-the-art special effects, the only thing that salvages the movie.
Marsh (John Forsythe) and abetted by Texan belle Carla Forester (Eleanor Parker), Roper is forced to follow the fugitives...even though the path leads straight into the country of the bloodthirsty Mescalero Apaches.
Director John Sturges has made many entertaining and adventurous movies in his career and I consider this as one of them, though it obviously is not his best work.
William Holden is good in his role, though it's hard to always like him because of the stubbornness and seemingly lack of emotion of the character.
It's a score worth searching out, though I don't think it's available anywhere.
As though to illustrate why his love for the girl can never be realized, the tramp tosses food to Merna from her lofty perch in the empty tent, they are from different worlds.
The IMDb profile and the other user comments highlight many of the generally innovative and well-executed gags and set-ups but I thought I would provide a list of things to look out for that don't get so much attention:  - the hungry tramp stealing bites of hot dog from a toddler; only chaplin and his tramp would need to add mustard to the illicit gain  - though a famous shot for chaplin-niks, the brilliant harmony (aided greatly by the manic section of music) as both the thief and the tramp end up in parallel flight from the coppers, essentially for the same crime.
Though certainly one of Chaplin's lesser efforts, 'The Circus' is an enjoyable and imaginative thread of slapstick gags, with the occasional hint of pathos, though not to the extent of many of the Tramp's other feature-length outings.
It was Charles Chaplin, in even his early films, who discovered that tragedy and comedy were never too far apart: though 'The Circus' doesn't quite balance the two as evenly as his various masterpieces, such as 'Modern Times (1936)' and 'The Great Dictator (1940),' it remains a joyous slapstick romp, with more than enough heart to go around.
Despite this danger, and despite Chaplin's off-screen egotism, the premise plays beautifully, especially since The Little Tramp (though not Chaplin) is such a terrible comedian when he's trying to be one.
Even though this seems like the recipe for a feel-good romantic comedy, in Chaplin's vision, the guy doesn't get the girl.
Even though silent films aren't seen by many people these days, it's works of art like this that will endure forever.
Gosling also did a pretty good job, though IMO some of his mannerisms didn't work.
(though that could be on the director)  The first half of the film was very interesting and moved at a steady pace, and the way Hopkins character played the system was impressive but the last half hour or so dragged IMO and took to long to get to the twist.
Needless-to-say, the case is not the slam dunk that Willy perceives it to be, and thus we have a battle of wits between Ted and Willy whose ego is just about as huge as Ted's though he is a slight bit less obnoxious - although not by much.
Even though Sir Anthony Hopkins played a role almost exactly identical to that of his previous Hannibal Lecter, it was still great to see him back in this form because that's what I always thought he was best at: the maniacal genius.
You feel drawn to him in almost the same way you feel drawn to Hopkins, even though Willy is in a dark place for most of the film and is hardly in control.
McQueen's last illness came on him with suddenness, though he looks his 50 years, he doesn't look ill in The Hunter.
Even though McQueen was feeling the effects of his illness during the shooting of this one, he still does a great job.
This is nowhere near the peak of the show's stupidity though.
There are some messages presented amidst all of this though.
There is no interesting confrontation though.
You get to hear the theme in supposedly moving scenes though.
It won't take too long though.
Even though there is a tone of violence (I'm talking extreme R rated gore) and nudity (not sex related) the show is very well done.
The pacing runs perfectly for the main story but their were also a few loose ends that i wanted tied up, maybe i shouldn't complain though as the ending did a great thing and left me thinking about it, or maybe an OVA down the tracks, i would be all for it.
Those that have though, are instead pondering why they haven't been put together sooner.
Even though this series is 13 episodes long, it is really just astounding how powerfully moving it is.
Looks like a big budget film, even though it wasn't a Hollywood film.
For some reason I still haven't figured out but already deeply regret, I decided to watch it after all even though I'd knew it would have the same painful effect as poking my own eyes out with a rusty spoon and pour sour vinegar in the badly infected eye-sockets.
Even though most they were crude, they were plentiful and interesting.
but if someone was pick up one film, as a beacon, as an example of the great emotional and spiritual waves that flow though India, it would be this one.
They receive from each other the love they so desire - motherly love for Nandu, a true companion for Anand, and a child and husband for Pushpa - though their relationship with each other has no social legitimacy.
though ghost games is not the scariest movie it is one of the smartest indie movies i have seen and has a smart sense of humor.
I believe that he will succeed and though many people did not love this movie on the budget it was made i think it is wonderful.
Jaws 4: the revenge was worse though, its pretty far fetched how a shark would know the brody family and would be stalking them in the Caribbean (jaws 4 plot).
We also get far more of Dom DeLuise mugging away as if semaphore were back in fashion than is strictly necessary, though he's not as OTT here as in Sherlock, for which we can at least be grateful.
Even though he is kinda weird hair in Hsm3.
I enjoyed the first HSM even though I thought I wouldn't since my kids are in college and the Disney Channel is something I rarely watch.
True, we should remember to keep our friends close even though the future might cause us to go our separate ways, but I felt that the movie didn't communicate this message in a realistic context.
What's new, though?
Even though there were definitely cheesy moments in the film- namely, all the talk about "changes" and "saving the summer" sounding kind of like a little kid's book- there were definitely redemptive moments too.
This time though the quality of the music has been stepped up a notch, with a more conscious effort to write more theatrical music (with the exception of a few silly fillers).
The real star though is Kenny Ortega who helms the project and brings some exceptional choreography and ideas to the small screen.
Don't get me wrong though, it was a good thing that they didn't make it in to the same thing, but the songs were bad and it just doesn't seem to live up to the first movie.
Her crush on Troy was a good thing for the movie, though.
I was severely disappointed though with the musical score which was jaw-droppingly awful.
Troy needs money to help pay for college (though wasn't his family rich in the first movie?
At first it's not well received but then apparently folks decide that they like it, too bad he's put a hit out on himself to end it all though and the guy that arranged all that has a heart attack before he can call off the hit.
I found myself agreeing with almost everything in this film (though the part about the elimination of all races went too far).
The ending is strange and doesn't come as a complete surprise, though it's good to watch and finishes the film off nicely.
The original films could not have much better though because a couple of these actors - okay, most of these actors are just downright awful from the lead Barry Norton to the excessiveness of Jack Del Rio looking like a psychopath at the ship's steering wheel to the laughable persona of Jack Barty as the captain to the even more ludicrous native chief with a New York accent.
The worst part about this terribly over-the-top scene is not the silly way Bickford, now stricken with guilt, jumps up and admits the truth (though this is a ridiculous scene), but the way that lawyer J. Carrol Naish is allowed to attack Dunne on the witness stand!
From then on it is as though she doesn't exist.
I recommend "Upperworld" for fans of 1930s cinema, even though I was extremely disappointed with the abrupt ending.
I don't think it has ever been shown on British TV since about 1980, though i know it has been shown at least twice altogether because i remember my dad telling me he had seen it (and giving away the ending!).
The language is great though, not too much swearing but where there is swearing its funny.I love Pierce Brosnan, I think hes cool and the movies cast well.
His take on Max is to play it with an economy of gestures, as though he is bored by being told what to do.
Don Cheadle doesn't have much to do, as his character looks as though he was an after thought.
The story about the diamond heist though, seems secondary to the beautiful locations, and Brett Ratner's obcession with filming Miss Hayek's chest from all conceivable angles (not necessarily a bad thing).
But more than anything - in my opinion - it shows how, even though the USSR clearly betrayed its ideals, Joan maintains hers.
In his hands, Stalin is a caricature, and so the potential unease we might have on Joan's behalf (though she's fiercely dedicated, she wouldn't stand behind a mass murderer) is passed over, and he comes off like a marshmallow.
It was just so unseemly that Allison McKenzie and Little Norman Page were under suspicion of skinny dipping even though they did no such thing.
Undoubtedly, the numerous noms had some level of canceling out; and, adding to the confusion, Ms. Turner's was the lone "Best Actress" citation, though she was secondary to Ms. Varsi, and equal to Ms. Lange.
Involving and polished, though just a bit stiff or starchy.
It's as though, having gone through so many trials and tribulations (very well portrayed by the entire cast), all is right with the world again.
In fact, as averse as I usually am to longer films, I feel as though Peyton Place could have benefitted from another half hour at least.
John Michael Hayes did a fine job of adapting the book, tightening the plot and losing most of the cynicism, though it can be argued that the book's feminist slant was lost in the process as well.
Even though the town (and residents) were fictitious, this book created an uproar.
I love movie's that include vintage war planes in the plot, and this is no exception- even though the ME-109 and Japanese Zero were substituted by a repainted P-51B and a T-6 Texan.
The film also adds some characterization and entertaining action sequences, and attempts, though not very effectively, to employ comic relief (Phill Lewis' character).
McLish is not a bad actress, though not quite up to the level of the rest of the cast.
Sounds like a drug rehab center, though.
Great obscure little made for TV movie, something like a hybrid between "The Thing" and "The Shining" (even though that movie was still several years away from being made).
Leonardo DeCaprio played a convincing tough guy even though he is skinnier than most of the girls I've dated.
Even though the draft and race riots did not really happen at the same time.
It's interesting though, as a comparison, the actual base human story of "Titanic" has the same cookie-cutter romance elements as "Gangs" yet it is crystal clear that the FOCUS of "Titanic" is on an IMMACULATE portrayal of both the ship itself, the passengers, and the events that took place -- an accurate portrayal of history is the most important factor.
Then Day Lewis's character looks to be though out as a love-him hate-him kind of guy.
In amongst this diversion there's something of a plot hole since Bill takes the young Amsterdamn under his wing even though he knows who he is .
Thus, though you might entertain a flicker of interest in the Hamletesque question of whether the son will avenge the father, you wind up so bored w/DiCaprio that you don't freakin' care anymore by the time he gets around to doing the deed (which is rather done for him before he even bothers to show up).
In fact, though Leonardo keeps staring out at you from that bland little face and trying to convince you that he's struggling with Complex Moral Issues, the fact is: Every single person in this movie is reprehensible and evil, with differences in degree but never in kind.
Really though, its just too soppy for me.
You can be sucked in to the time of the movie, and even though the setting is much before our time you don't need a textbook to understand how things were run and what life was like.
The humor is cheesy and full of bad puns, the acting is decent but not Oscar-worthy, and some scenes are just not politically correct (though by far much less gross than any other Troma movie ever made).
Troma is known for their anti-capitalism views, and it shows here (though more subtle than in "Troma's War" or "Terror Firmer").
It's everything you expect from Troma, though more tame and with a little more plot.
I can't properly judge the use of special effects, though.
Joe, Drew's roommate, willingly puts up with being denied access to his room every time there is a `sock on the doorknob' and the two boys are actually good friends even though Joe is the polar opposite of Drew.
though on the other hand he did help adapt this from a novel form.
Tightly plotted (there's always something happening, but the complications never get too confusing) and smoothly directed, it's a movie that knows how to keep you absorbed, even though its nihilistic ending is slightly cliched.
It is disappointing, though.
The period nature of the movie was likewise attractive... oh how it would be fun to be able to step back into a setting such as that, though I'll pass on the cleansing processes!
The problem with it is that though Panama and Frank were quite good at light comedy, they were inexperienced in the western genre.
It proudly carries on the tradition started by Forbidden Planet and This Island Earth, even though its not as exciting.
"Ikarie XB 1" stumbles badly, though, when it comes to the exterior effects work.
The film gives no clue whatsoever if the tales being told have anything to do with some army in particular in some period of history or with the lord of the rings saga..  (Hint: the turks are the orks, and Tirant resembles Aragorn, though no Virgo Mortensen in sight just a lookalike).
The intellectual level is that of children, though young teens may find pleasure in the action.
James (Macaulay Culkin) and Heather (Alexis Dziena) are young, attractive and in love, though Heather is finally able to confide in James that she is unable to achieve orgasm in their otherwise satisfactory sex life.
I will fault the distributor, though, for marketing this title as a horror film; rather, it is a psychological thriller that relies more on the slow building of suspense than on blood or gore.
However, he is not quite up to the task, though the film was a large improvement on his last traditional film, "Almost Heroes."
The acting in the film is quite good, though the characters require little.
"A Mighty Wind" is probably my least favorite though it had its moments.
I still liked Willard though.
Incredibly enough the majority of characters in the story are clueless about what the internet is or how it operates even though the story seemingly takes place in 2006 (strike two).
The movie was over before it stated with a running time of slightly over an hour and it appeared as though Guest just plain gave up and quit so the studio called in a editor to finish the project.
It was dreadful, though.
Even though the characters were the jokes, Guest never seemed to dislike them, or make us dislike them.
With the same cast, the same satirical (though not full out mockumentary) style, it simply asks for that and it doesn't succeed the way those movies do.
But that's a lot of the fun with his films, even though his newest is easily the most structured of the bunch.
As Callie, Parker Posey is more in reactive mode here, though she has a funny Sandra Bernhard-like bit with her character's one-woman show, "No Penis Intended".
Whatever the film's shortcomings, it is the smaller details that are purely Guest which make this film a triumph and future classic: Guest's perfect intonation as he instructs one actor to deliver his line as though "Mommy is goingÂ now?
Law-sided demoralization and violence are initial drives of the story's turning point though not at the center.
It was very entertaining, fast-moving and the best of the Fields movies, I think, even though Edgar and Charlie steal the show.
Even more revealing, though, is footage of the festival's production and management, including riots, rebellious patrons, break-ins, and mordant commentary on why rock festivals don't happen anymore.
The cast makes it watchable, though.
Watch the zoom-in shot at the beginning from outer space to the Meditteranean, it is alright, though a bit clichÃ© these days, then go demand your money back for those of you who have accidentally bought your tickets in advance.
Even though I liked the way it was shown, silence while car on air, and then crash!
When you look at their respective filmographies, you know for sure that "Agents secrets" won't be a "Troy" or a "Along Came Polly" (though I do respect and love Brad and Jennifer, their career moves are sometimes, well, surprising).
Don't expect too many visual effects here : the suspense is intensely psychological and the cast does deliver, even though the screenplay sometimes doesn't (to be honest, the story is not always clear).
Be warned, though: there are no pauses to let you laugh and no punchlines telling you when to laugh (a lot of people can't seem to understand humour without the latter).
I thought that was beautiful because even though Rosie was the maid, her and Aurora were like family and when Aurora was carrying Rosie in the rain to take her home for the final moments of her life, that was truly beautiful.
It's blandly amusing watching Van Dien plug away ineptly at both his heroics and English accent, though this is ultimately an empty diversion for completest only.
Evidently some violence has been cut, the movie appears like a family movie, but there still are some violent moments, were people are killed (mostly off-screen though).
You will enjoy it greatly, though I promise you, you will be VERY depressed by it.
Then again, if you expect a happy ending from a Ring movie, you haven't watched any of the others (and I do mean ANY, though some are bittersweet, none end truly happily)
I don't know how the book goes, so I won't complain about the storyline or characters too much, though I have to say those bad guys were incredibly lame and paperthin.
If you intend to purchase or rent this film be warned that even though it will be in the horror section and the title, box art and description on the box will lead you to belive it is a horror movie, IT IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE.
He is very blatant in his attempts to put the moves on her even though she has a boyfriend.
(I know it's totally politically incorrect for me to call it 'sort of' when, in fact, she is assaulted and the assault is sexual in nature, though apparently no actual penetration takes place as Keach has trouble getting it up.)
While he is doing this, though, Butters' dad walks in with horrible assumptions.
It really doesn't make any original statements on the issue of gays, though it has tackled this subject several times in the past.
You get the idea though.
But perhaps the biggest winner of the evening was the Mexican/Spanish movie "El Laberinto del Fauno", that took home 3 awards though not the most important (Best foreign language film) one.
Clint Eastwood seemed very nervous presenting and messed up his lines, which was odd to see from a person of his caliber and acting past, though he would claim it was because of he forgot his glasses.
Same goes for Forest Whitaker who did the best speech of the evening, though he of course was also the one that could prepare himself the best, since it almost was a formality for him to pick up the award.
Because lets face it, the guy is almost 80-years already and he has his best years behind him, though he himself would probably disagree with me.
It was also weird to see Gore holding an Oscar, though the cause he fights for is of course a good one.
Often when (male) actors are asked to "play gay" you get an overly sexualized relationship - as though they feel the only way to portray the connection between men is through overt lust.
Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode.
Somehow though, when Ari Meyers left the program, the spell seemed to have been broken.
The scenes with Jean-Claude Van Dame is beautiful, even though this actor is sometimes laugh at, he appears as an angel in this film.
The film is good, though in the 21st century it shows it's age, and the violence of warfare seems so, so small compared with our daily fare on television.
The movie started out nice though, since me and my friend have a little gag going around that there are three things that a good movie needs: a helicopter, breast and a midget (preferably one that gets kicked away, or kicks himself in the head).
though I did laugh from time to time, so if you can watch it for free and want a good laugh by making fun of all the goofs, then I recommend it.
I will admit though that the avalanche scene is quite well done even though it steals footage from the film Avalanche (1999) so I can't give it that much credit since the best sequence in the film was at least in part stolen from another film.
The Seminoles look great even though they did not look like that in 1840.
The plot though, is hacky and takes nonsensical twists and turns (we see the main character fooling around with the blonde bimbo in the hot tub, then later she tells the girlfriend nothing happened, its just silly).
Unlike the Ringu and Ring 2 this has a slower pace even though the movie was short it felt long because of the pacing.
Yes there are some dodgy bits like the old age make up, though the makeup in the sixties was better, the ending is weak and it was a pity to go out with a whimper considering the rest of the film had such balls.
These though are not enough to spoil the film.
Eddie Sparks is a complex part and Caan mastered all the subtleties even though he's not my idea of a song and dance man.
Slippery as an eel though the McCarthy era up until the end.
Then I saw it as an adult and though it was not the great film I remembered it was still very good as an action and adventure sort of western.
Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode.
Even though this film doesn't sparkle with a huge budget and sexy highly paid stars, it is a story that hits home.
An important thing to keep in mind, though, is that these Fox Faith films are thankfully not "preachy."
The theme of the dead sister's original undoubtedly, though I'd rather have let Shu live and kick butt (wow those beautiful, deadly legs!
:))The elevator scene's spectacular though I think it's quite hard to kick butt like that in such a narrow space.
Jack's on-island speech is less character-specific though; it can be applied to everyone.
The episode has more to be remembered for than these two speeches though.
I'll be brief, though the length of this video film is everything but short.
More importantly though, the film is constantly condescending towards its characters and though the purpose was probably to blame all the ugliness on our existence or on Communist states, finally the condescension and bestiality is all Palfi's.
I don't recommend this film to anyone... even though it is beautifully filmed and at the highest quality... you have to have the stomach to watch it.
No white talking head experts are needed in this film, though it is not clear how much influence LaChapelle had over the participants' self-awareness over the three years he was making the film, as we only hear his voice a couple of times asking questions, usually of their mothers.
The interviews on "Charlie Rose" should be included with the DVD as there is no concluding update to learn that some of the participants are now employed professionally as dancers, though we did get a glimpse that Miss Prissy is taking some formal dance training.
Even though it seemed like her life was incompatible with the ballet, church dancing and krumping, she was hard core, beautiful and made it work.
The fight scenes are incredible (luv the swordfight) and though lacking in dialogue, there is humour, love, beauty, betrayal and a whole lot of other things to make it a well-rounded movie.
After a few minutes though I found that I couldn't have been more wrong.
Did someone put a gun to her head though?
Given that a second, bigamous marriage would in any case have been invalid, though, I'm not sure that Harold needed to put quite so much effort into reaching the altar in time: whether the ceremony had been completed or not, the girl would still have been free to marry her real lover half an hour or so afterwards...  Definitely better than "Safety Last", although perhaps more uneven: danger stunts in themselves leave me fairly cold, but there is some enjoyable character work in this picture.
'Girl Shy' is what Lloyd liked to call a "character story," as opposed to a "gag film," though the plot does an exceptional job of retaining room for significant elements of both.
About the only negatives, and they are minor, are that the chase at the end has been done before (though rarely as well) and the whole stuttering thing seems like a cheap way to get a laugh.
In it's defence though, things definitely improved, until towards the ending it moves at a furious pace with wonderful fight scenes.
One thing though which makes this film are the attractive hot chicks kicking ass, with a sense of sexual undercurrent.
There are not many and as a rule they do not get to Hollywood and do not get any Oscars, though they may make their mark in Cannes, Berlin, Venice, San SebastiÃ¡nÂÂÂ.
Recommended film, though people learning Spanish might find some of the accents a little difficult at times.
So did I - even though I had to look up a couple of period references.
I can say that this is another one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen, though I have seen a lot of movies funnier than this one, but it is just one of the funniest movie that I have seen in my life!
He never made the screen impact that other singers did, though he was in some very good films.
Edward G. Robinson, always superb, is fine as always; at first I can't recognize Loretta Young though, while on the other hand, Leslie Fenton doesn't initially strike me as Chinese.
Anyway, I came here today to find out what he's up to now (after running into one of his producers, Kerry Johnston, recently at a restaurant here in Hollywood on La Cienega - who said he was about to begin filming his seventh film at the end of this month in Wyoming - though I suspected she was purposely throwing me off his trail, as she looked at me like I was a stalker), and, remarkably, IMDb only has this, his first time behind the lens, listed.
Question, though: Why doesn't Mr. Holden sell his movies to Netflix or Blockbuster?
All I do know, though, is this film made me take the time to post this, and that says a lot in my book.
I am admittedly not fond of the dubbing, even though it's a lot better than some I've heard.
No sex, though, and the only romance is implied through dialogue.
Be sure to get the "special edition" and not the "toonami edition" though.
The story is engaging, the characters (though textbook heroes) are still well-written, and that's it.
You'll really have to watch the TV series first though, as I have to admit (like all movies of TV series I should think...), otherwise you'll be sitting there going, 'Whaaaa...?'
She's claims that she's doing her father's will even though her father gave his life to maintain peace for the colonies and earth.
Could have done without two gratuitous flying scenes of Zhao near the end, though, which add a jarring CTHD note to the otherwise enjoyable action.
Anne Hathaway is a great movie star, because she can play the buddy thing... i mean to say that she is not trying to take over the movie, even though she could, and i loved that.
I thought 27 Dresses had a pretty good plot, even though it was way way way predictable, the characters were likable and different.
It isn't enough to save the film though - it's still a piece of rubbish.
I think one of the reasons this movie disturbed me though was due to the fact that there are women like this, one's that are so beyond obsessed with their wedding they don't even realize they're getting married.
The "head crushing"-scene was nice (though they cut away just a second too soon).
You'll get used to that, though, as there are many more.
The story isn't the most clever or ingenious ones, at least not when being compared to the best and most memorable Columbo movies but it's a story that doesn't bore and still provides plenty of surprises and entertainment, even though this movie doesn't feature as much comical relief as was the case in some other Columbo movies, which in my opinion is a positive thing.
Since I have already watched Goal 1, I though I should continue with Goal 2, but expecting it will not be as good, but not really bad.
Then it seemed as though Hong Yat Hong may have been our main character, the woman-cop who knows only that these two are hired killers whom she must catch.
Saying that though, I thought it was good entertainment.
I expected more soccer related scenes though.
A gang of grating young criminals (each with 'issues') meet a Rick Moranis-ish scientist in the desert in order to procure the titular character for an Internet client who is promising to deliver a large sum of money (it seems as though they lack common sense when dealing with those junk chain-letters that arrive in the 'ol Inbox).
Even though it is the worst movie ever made you should still watch it, just to be able to say I have seen the most HORRIBLE movie ever created!
This is the first vampire film to show a bat to vampiric man transformation and has good performances even though Lou Chaney Jr. isn't too bad as a vampire as much as he is as The Wolf Man, it's not as excellent as the first one but it's a great sequel.
There's one particular citizen played by Julie Warner who wants to offer the ultimate in hospitality even though her ever present steady boyfriend Woody Harrelson is around.
Even though I consider myself a classic horror fan (and a fan of the classic Universal horror movies in particular), I readily admit that Dracula (1931) is not among my favorites.
What made this movie horrible, though, is that it just didn't measure up to the originals (Taxi and Taxi 2).
Even though I don't understand French, and my Taxi DVDs do not have subtitles, I still thoroughly enjoy them, as they are packed full of exciting car chases and slapstick humour.
In the french one there are a lot more stuns than in the American version of Taxi even though the American version had a lot more funds.
Girls (except the lead character) are hot, though they could be hotter to get it a R rate.
The first couple minutes is not bad, though unconvincing.
Sometimes he tried too hard to be funny though.
They changed the sex of the lead (though the Queen is excellent), combined others and rewrote the cops mother to the point of stupidness.
That should take you the better part of 5 hours and in the end you will not feel as though you've wasted your life.
Jack Klugmans excellent as the coroner with an axe to grind and there's fine support from John S.Ragin and Robert Ito.It always makes me laugh though when instead of just doing autopsies he'll investigate and solve the case the detectives never solve it and I think in one episode Monaghan says Quincy should get a Police pension for all the detective work he does.A slice of classic TV with memorable stories and characters Quincy is well worth a watch.
In fact, I was more than a bit surprised at how little Lon seems to be in this picture or how rarely he opens his mouth, though I guess it doesn't take a lot of seeing Chaney on-screen to notice how ill-suited he is at portraying a Hungarian count; much less a count who is supposed to be from the same gene pool as Bela Lugosi.
Even though Chaney wasn't the world's most convincing Hungarian, his performance is not a washout.
The film imagines Washington D.C. 50 years from now, and that very prediction of our lifestyle is ambitious indeed; cars which drive themselves, home appliances which operate on voice command, holograms and highways which even run vertically Â the most wild and imaginative concepts are placed together into one single movie, and even though it eventually builds to disappointing level of cynicism and implausibility, it's still wonderful to look at and experience.
What really makes this movie stand out is not the visual effects (though, they certainly are amazing), but it is the human aspect of this film that makes it a memorable experience for the audience.
All though Chaney lacks the thick Lugosi accent he has his mannerisms and creates mystery in his voice.
As soon as he arrives though the plantation's master, Colonel Caldwell, dies conveniently leaving his morbid daughter Kay the deed to the plantation in his will.
Evelyn Ankers is as always, very easy on the eyes, and though she is given little to do here, she does it fetchingly.
This is likely the fault of Lionsgate though.
)and some pretty decent kills,with a good amount of gore.there are your typical teen stereotypes getting high out in the wilderness.the problem is,the movie takes too long to get to the gore and really good kills.once the blood starts flying though,it doesn't let up.the movie borrows a bit from the 1981 movie "Wolfen",giving us some shots from the creatures point of view.other than this movie and "Wolfen",i haven't seen that done in any other movie.not that it's a great effect or anything,but it is something most movies of the genre don't employ.the acting isn't that great and some of the dialogue is pretty bad,to say the least.However,i really liked Dione Updike,who plays Aimee,Johnston,one of the game wardens who hunts the creature.She was very convincing in her role and easy on the eyes too.finally,the creature itself.not quite realistic looking,but not as bad as some movies of the genre.oh,yea,the creature is basically,half man,half wolf.the difference is,it retains the intelligence of man.i guess you'd call it a werewolf,although they never actually say the word in the movie.the ending i thought was kind of odd.overall,though, the movie is entertaining and should satisfy gore hounds.
though this puts me in the minority,i give "The Feeding" 7/10
The werewolf, though a commendable SFX effort, looked more like a Power Ranger villain.
I would love to get a copy of it on any format I can get, preferably DVD though, but video would do.
That she would, in the police station, with her sanity questioned, begin to ACT as though she were not quite right in the head was also predictable, with predictable results.
This 1954 film was clearly a vehicle for an aging Barbara Stanwyck, even though the woman in the story must have been in her twenties.
Mr. Sanders was not at his best though, even as the man who's always a step ahead of our heroine.
Cheryl is considered an hysterical single woman who has delusions because she isn't married and probably going through menopause, though this isn't out and out stated.
We are taken to a world that, though not specifically unrealistic, somehow exists in that part of the mind where the rules may have been suspended.
Frankly, though I adore Ms. Davis as an actress, Crawford was so good here that I don't mind at all--she had a great knack for playing playing characters on the edge of sanity.
Louise, in the beginnings of her confusion, isn't sure which), Louise decides to marry the lonely widower even though she tells him she's not in love with him and even though his daughter Carol (played so well by Gerladine Brooks) dislikes her intensely.
Heflin though, I never liked.
the movie does not have much of a plot and though the story seems veers to a cliched and predictable end, there are enough minor twists that abound in the movie, making it quite an enjoyable watch.
The end was predictable, but Sciorra and Dillon are convincing as angry ex- spouses who have gone in different directions and the numerous character actors fill in the occasional boring spots, especially Dan Hedeya - I like anything he does though, so I am biased.
It actually took 3 hours to get though because I kept scanning back in disbelief to make sure I actually saw what I saw.
An aging physician and an Hungarian scholar are soon after him, though.
This is not a commercial plug, just a service to IMDb users like myself, who had heard about this unreleased film in the US and most of South America (though it was in Argentina), and may want to gain access to it.
Quoting from Hedayat's "The Blind Owl", he says that he left home because of he was weary with his life in Iran and now aspires to be a singer of Persian classical songs, though he drives a taxi to stay alive.
As a result, it's cute, well acted and paced and one of Dietrich's better, though not so famous, films.
It was as though all 3 films were made at the same time, I love it when there isn't a horridly noticeable gap between productions, which ruins the feeling you get from the original.
i have watched this film several years back and when i finally landed in a place where there are millions of ofws, i felt compelled to write a review of it even though i believe no one would even bother reading it.
By today's standards I suppose Son Of Dracula is none too frightening, though it nicely suggests the link between horror and everyday life, normal emotions and regional traditions, which, while this might not mean much nowadays, certainly resonated in the America of sixty years ago, which it effectively evokes.
As a struggling single mother, though, it is hard to feel empathy for the rich lady who cries about having to be "responsible for everything" when she lives in a big fancy house, doesn't have to work out of the home, and has a husband who is too much fun.
There are many great atmospheric scenes to name just a few, when Chaney materializes on the top of a coffin, that has just risen out of the swamp, and when Allbritton passes though the bars to see Paige.
I would like to say at the outset that even though I was disappointed that Cynthia Rothrock doesn't do more of her martial arts stuff in this film and I did think it a bit preposterous how indestructible Dakota Smith, played by Fred Williamson, appears to be, I enjoyed NIGHT VISION and am glad that it is a part of my DVD collection.
In under one hour, this film tells a complex story, yet is exciting and plays like a good mystery, though in a western setting.
It seems as though the writers thought that anything showing gays would stir up interest.
The narrator had a great voice, though.
Ironically, though the material is definitely for teen-aged boys, they probably won't go to see it because of the title.
Don't worry though, it all turns out fine in the end.
He has a measure of talent and charisma and likability, and I applaud his deserved financial and critical success with the Wayne's World and Austin Powers films (though he went one movie too far with Goldmember).
You've got one really funny joke about Guru Pitka's mom getting a job that kills even though it was in the trailer, Stephen Colbert finally hits one out of the park as a robot cyborg after failing three previous times to elicit any laughs, Jessica Alba is gorgeous as always if you overlook her atrocious acting abilities, and Justin Timberlake shows he has no shame and steals every single second of screen time he is given.
Admittedly, though, this is not my kind of comedy.
The problem is, though, that the role itself is paper-thin and very, very tiresome.
I did get some good laughs though, out of the previews for "Tropic Thunder" and "Hamlet II".
Ironically, though the material is definitely for teen-aged boys, they probably won't go to see it because of the title.
On a positive note though, Justin Timberlake and Stephen Colbert are hilarious.
Out of all of the Three Stooges shorts that I have watched and loved in my life, I can say that though there are some shorts that I like better than others, I can not say that I have seen one Three Stooges short that I have hated, I love all of the ones that I have seen, and I believe that is a very good thing that I have!
Most terrifying of all though, is an infamous sequence in which the mice take Sylvester to the basement.
Samuel L. Jackson (character Jack Friar) is believable, though not one of his better movies.
He was an inherently urban type, and though he could play small-town midwesterners with great relish at times, there was always that impish glint in his eye that suggested that he knew much, much more about life than his character did.
The themes include a robbery plan that goes awry though here it is more of a con rather than robbery and it is executed without resorting to violence.
As a kept girl with ten percent rebate on pedicure expense, though she is cunning in some scenes , but she is also deadly frightened.
There's not much of a background to the witch Misa in this story, as she's pretty much thrown right into this one and we got to accept it, even though this vagueness could frustrate.
I didn't like Little Britain Abroad though, it failed to make me laugh.
It seemed as though Andy's catchphrase "yeah, I know" kept on recurring again and again, and the routine of Andy wanting something then not liking it once receiving it became as time-worn as various pantomime routines.
Everyone who thinks Little Britain sucks, have no sense of humour/ humor, and can't accept that Little Britain is funny even though it's not from the USA!!!
From Daffyth - The only gay in the village, a stereotype that we know all too well to the Cross Dressing lady boys who act as though they want to remain subtle in their acts cross dressing however draw attention to themselves whenever possible.
What Little Britain failed to do though was to actually create new jokes, instead favouring the use of the jokes from the first episode all the way through to the 2nd series, and 3rd if there is one.
(I'm trying to fill 10 lines) As good as it is--it ain't The Benny Hill Show though---sorry
A series 4 will not be out for at least 2 yeas though, as the guys have taken the show on the road, with Little Britain Live.
Some, though funny, just seem to lose steam after a while (such as the guy who breast feeds).
Personally though, I spent most of the movie hoping all those kids would fall in a well.
Electric Shadows has a bit of everything, even though some might like to compare it to Cinema Paradiso, I thought that this film had merits to stand on its own two feet despite the obvious comparison.
Against this backdrop, Ling Ling leads quite an eventful life, where the pace catapults with the introduction of Mao Xiaobing (Wang Zhengjia), a scruffy kid from out of town whose mischievousness brings trouble, but for their love of movies which brought them together to be best frien uds forever, even though he prefers the action genre where he can make-belief he's the star of the show.
I first heard about this much earlier adaptation of the book around that time, but it took me seven years to finally get around to watching it, even though I had been intending to watch it for quite a while by the time I did.
He's not much of an actor at all, though Punch Drunk Love was good (goes to show what a good director can do).
Sandler is also good, and though he's most known only for Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison, Sandler was also hilarious in this movie.
He tries to provoke Sandler in some kind of pseudo mental health treatment but how is it that Sandler follows his advice even though he knows pretty early on that he is dealing with a nutball.
Even though, the scene is highly unbelievable it is far better to have the bully be exactly the same as he used to be than having him totally transformed into a good guy.
This funny, out of character Adam Sandler vehicle was bumpy at best, with a rather insulting Buddhist monk scene and some unintentionally dumb sequences as well as some overly obvious cameos which made the movie campy though tolerably cute.
This feel good, though somewhat over the top anger solves anger philosophy ends up with a small twist and a satisfying conclusion.
I saw this movie in the theater with my father and I have to say even though Sandler can annoy me most of the time, this is one of his better comedies.
Here's something neat though - I liked the idea that Kilpatrick had the town of Santa Rosa so organized that they were able to back him up at a moment's notice with all hands on deck.
As soon as I heard it, I hearkened back to my childhood watching those old Warner Brothers cartoons, and even though I can't remember which one it was, I can clearly hear in my mind the words "Which way did he go George, which way did he go?"
The city-council though has other plans with de seafront and the pier does not really fit into their plans.
All of the Japanese actors, of course, acted for Kurosawa, so you would expect them to be excelent, but their acting style may be a bit too old for this movie, though they may be quite impressive by themselves or in their element.
And though the point goes unstated, the arrangement shapes up like a farm co-operative where everyone contributes and has a stake, an outcome certainly compatible with the spirit of the New Deal times.
He made a promise to do that, and, by golly, he's going to stick with it, even though he has to live with the often dire results.
As a result three men (including a likely incarcerated George) are victimized instead of one man, Lennie, being institutionalized, difficult though that would be.
George is very nimble of mind.Possessing an innate, though uneducated, store of knowledge in practical matters.
She even tries her 'charms' on Lenny and even though George warned him to stay away.
Just a couple of questions though: The genie's arm-cuffs disappeared when he was freed; why is he wearing them again now?
Aladdin, even though he lives in the palace, still cannot dress respectibly for most of the film and is still chased by Razoul.
Abis Mal is so stupid though that there's enough comedy relief too; it's good.
Anyway, Genie returns from his trip and brings back the laughs (even though he is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, even in "Kingdom Hearts", he is still funny).
They get attacked (including Genie, disguised as Aladdin LOL), and just when things get hopeless, Iago grabs Jafar's lamp, and even though he's hurt by Jafar, he lets go of the lamp, which falls into the lava, destroying Jafar for good.
Aladdin and Jasmine are not married in this film, (even though they married at the end of the first movie) and the only really memorable scene is a brief goof, where the Sultan loses his eyebrows for a split second.
Lewis Milestone manages to avoid any sense of being stage-bound, though his wide-open-spaces shots are quite limited.
As rare as it is, Disney will have good sequels that will come out and one of those is Return of Jafar, even though this one you can tell the animation isn't as great as the original and Robin Williams skipped out on this one, I still really enjoyed this Disney sequel.
With Iago's help, though, Jasmine eventually reconciles with Aladdin.
Even though Iago was a great little villain sidekick, I think I liked him better turning on Aladdin's side and seeing him rescue the gang from Jafar was just awesome.
Even though the soundtrack isn't as memorable as the first Aladdin, I still loved Iago's song "I'm looking out for me".
I do know, though, that we now make fun of the guy who loaned it to us.
It's about Irish-Catholic violence in Boston (even though it came afterwards, Gangs of New York portrays this theme more powerfully).
Less than five years after the English patient (though four, after speed 2) it is so sad to see a good actor acting badly in such a ridiculous film.
The action is non-stop and the dialogue, though very "offensive" (alot of the "f" word), is right on target for the setting and mood of the movie.
The cast's weak links are Betty Field--hopelessly overplaying her bored sex kitten--and Lon Chaney as Lenny, though both are very good in the pivotal scene that sets off the action of the film's finale.
The opening moments don't prepare you for what comes up next and even though the action (which there is quite a bit of and, as stated earlier, is extended in the unrated version) is quite bloody, there's a morbid sense of humor running throughout the carnage and I fell out laughing on more than one occasion during this picture.
A number of people seem to have picked up on this aspect of the movie and thus dubbed it similar to Pulp Fiction (though no one mentions Reservoir Dogs) when this movie takes non-linear storytelling to a level beyond where Quentin Tarrantino was ever able to go.
Movie is beneath him now, though.
It would have been more helpful to establish some real roots for his character, though, not to mention a moral compass of some kind.
Overall though, the film is worth checking out for Freeman's performance, and probably should be remembered better in Reeve's career than "Superman IV: The Quest For Peace".
Bible line for line, and is enacted out as though you were there in the presence of the Saviour Himself.
One point I must make against those who use the profound depth of this as a platform from which to condemn Mel Gibson's equally (though differently) anointed masterpiece, The Passion of the Christ, with priceless Jim Caviezel (though I'll always regret dear Mel didn't play the title role himself which would have been beyond awesome): they're quite wrongheaded on the score, for the testimony of Bruce and his company and Jim and his company are one in describing the divine (and therefore the counterattacking demonic) manifestations so present in the making of these jewels in our Lord's crown.
Even though it was shot on video, a lot of effort was obviously put into this by everyone involved.
I could not really find a plot in this movie (even though I was forced to watch it twice).
"Spoilers" are included, I guess, though there's nothing to spoil.
After about a half hour(or what seemed to be a half hour) of the two talkin about things you can't understand, because they're cleverly mumbling(I guess the director wanted to build a sense of mystery) we switch to a scene with the 70's guy, 2 chicks and another dude, who is the worst actor I've ever had the displeasure of viewing(though all the others are horrible), all step into an RV for a road trip.
His extendedly depicted agony is still horrifying, even though the make-up effects are cheap and very cheesy.
Terribly scared of their misdeed, they develop a sexually romantic relationship, though it seems to only spark when they commit murder...
After the initial shock, Ms. Vitti decides to kill both herself and her now ex-boyfriend, but before doing so she gives herself a week to live it up, so she sells all of her jewels, checks into a reasonably swank hotel, though probably below her usual standards, and parades around Paris in some very eye-catching outfits.
His first lead is a mass-market statuette of a terrified woman, the screaming mimi, sold by the first victim the day she was murdered... Argento changed many details in the process of turning "The Screaming Mimi" into The Bird With The Crystal Plumage, but the most important is this: flawed and weak though he may be, Brown's protagonist is afraid of the universe of madness glimpsed when he gets close to Yolanda Lang.
Julie London and Joanne Dru are also effective in somewhat understated roles, even though important to the story.
I don't quite know where this story fits into the first's, though I have read that some people prefer to view it as an alternate storyline.
It is 1) unrealistic that Irene Dunn, missing at sea for seven years, should reappear on the very day that husband, Cary Grant, has succeeded in having her declared dead and then, moments later, remarried in the same courtroom and 2) that Grant's mother would not have attended the wedding; presumably the writers needed Dunne's mother-in-law to be in when Dunne (who naturally would not have known about the new wedding so would have no reason to attend and try to stop it) resurfaced though a little thought could have solved this.
This animated story of Moses (though minutes into the movie, you almost forget it's animation!)
It is also my opinion that Irene Dunne was a more natural comedienne than she was a singer...good voice though she had.
It's interesting that even though Randolph Scott makes the obligatory declaration that, despite being on an island alone with Irene Dunne for 7 years, nothing happened, Dunne never validates this.
It's a well written story that offers plenty of surprises with its moments and main plot-line, even though of course the movie in a sense is mostly predictable, just like any other genre movie.
McCarey still served as the writer and producer of the movie though, so his touch is still notable within the movie.
Cary Grant and Irene Dunne were great together, and though "My Favorite Wife" is not as funny as "The Awful Truth," it's still pretty good.
OK, the story isn't its strength, well it could be although it is taken out of the bible, though some of the scenes very really moving, not just because of some superb animations (especially everything covering the presentation of H2O).
I do feel sorry for Gail Patrick though.
Unfortunately, because the brothers see the film as a rip-off, they have no plans to re-score it (it currently uses a temp-track that includes the Jones films, The Addams Family, The Rocketeer, Ricochet, The Hard Way, Mountains of the Moon, Sleeping With the Enemy, JFK, and lots of Cliff Eidelman's _Star Trek VI_ music, among others) and release it officially (which they can't in this current state), though they do sell it through their website.
People commenting on this list seem eager to use "worst movie of all time" to describe anything they happen to dislike, but I hesitate to use the phrase here, even though I am sorely tempted.
On a deeper, more spiritual level the film excels though.
As Sonya Rokoff, Luana Walters was much better, though her character should have been stronger.
The sets often look cheap and as though they have been thrown together randomly, or worse as if they are just walls with nothing behind them.
But though his career overlapped that of Nelson Eddy and they were separated only by four years in age, Tibbett could not have achieved what Eddy did in films.
This, though he works all the time with one of the best actors in the business, who is also one of my very favorites: Edward James Olmos.
Though not as extravagantly dressed as Crawford, the other actors always look like they're ready for an elegant dinner party, even though they never seem to leave the house.
That doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it though - no, I loved every minute of it.
The movie's greatest strength, though, is the overall production.
Secrets Of An Actress, though from the Warner B picture unit is a bright comedy, very typical of its time.
I prefer the first one, even though I like Henrikson as an actor.
The other problem though is Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford).
Anne Archer makes a welcomed return as Cathy Ryan though she is underused sadly.
Overall though it is unfair to call this an action film by any means.
These profound latter moments are fine and all in well, but when it keeps you waiting around with drably uninteresting characters and a confusing parade of predictable (though there "one" moment that's not-so) ideas.
There's some decent gore here, there's some really cool looking rotting zombies, there are decapitated heads & severed limbs, the main villain like to rip peoples heads in half, someone chest bursts open, someone saws their own legs & hand off & there are also various other minor bits of blood & gore throughout although the murder of Luis seemed cut as there are noticeable jumps in the audio & too many 'reaction' shots of Teresa & Dan even though seemingly nothing has happened.
That said, even though a lot of people have totally slated this movie for other aspects of it, I have to say that I still really enjoyed this as a movie!
The children was alright though, but the adult actors.......
Fast forward forty years and the village of Desbaria stands in its place; though the cult leader is waiting for his revenge.
I guess it's like a gruesome car-crash where you cannot divert your eyes away even though you should.
I settled down, and at the start it seemed as though that was exactly what we were going to be treated to ... but then it all went downhill.
Sure thereÂ´s been recently a fuss over mexican cinema, and even though there are some excellent films like Amores perros or Y tu mamÃ¡ tambiÃ©n, this one has nothing to do side to side with them.
Angus' interaction with his granddad (played by George C. Scott in possibly one of his most memorable, though short, roles since "Patton") is very interesting to pay attention.
The film would have been better though if we knew a little more about these people, so as to make it a character study.
Although admittedly it's not destined to be a classic (or at least any time soon), "Angus" is a genuinely warm, funny, bitterly sarcastic, though strictly Hollywood, picture of that ever-so-turbulent, confusing, and questionable time of our lives known as high school.
(I do wonder, though, if three soundtrack albums--the film's soundtrack, an "inspirational" album, and a "country" album--were really necessary.)
Unlike other teen movies this one seem to show everyone's side of high school life, even though the two main character's are "outcast" they're not really nerds.
The movie is about a fat kid, who like me was good at science and fair at football (though I truly despise football, thanks Coach!)
pps: james van der beek gave a great (though small) performance, very uncharacteristic of "the kid's movie villain".
Although the film does not demonstrate how Rick obtained such line of though, his mind is no-doubtedly locked in to this ideology.
One thing baffles me though: this movie is listed as comedy, but I found not much to laugh about.
Denied the element of surprise which invigorated RING's closing sequence, Nakata and screenwriter Hiroshi Takahashi are forced to rely on a dissonant music score, creepy sound effects and a handful of traumatic set-pieces (such as a nightmarish vision outside Nakatani's apartment window, and a heartstopping encounter with supernatural horror in a dilapidated well), though much of the material feels contrived and superfluous, and the climactic sequence (in which rational science is defeated by paranormal forces) is wholly inadequate.
Already the subject of a comprehensive TV series ("Ringu: Kanzen-ban", 1995) and a theatrical spin-off (THE SPIRAL, directed by Nakata and released in Japan at the same time as the original RING), the series represents little more than a millennial update of old-fashioned Japanese kaidan, though its ghostly villain ('Sadako') is now a part of the cultural lexicon throughout SE Asia (rather like Freddy Krueger in western society).
The story itself goes more in depth, even though of course lots of things are still left unexplained, like in this type of movies almost always is the case.
That is progress, though many fight it.
Even though Sadako had been around for a long time (there were Suzuki Koji's source books and two previous TV movies), it was the theatrical version of Ring that made her huge.
An effective thriller, even though it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
Admittedly, though, the explanation for the curse in Ringu 2 is much different than it was in Rasen/Spiral, and despite the sci-fi, the strong mystery genre "investigation" elements that many loved so much in Ringu are woven throughout the plot.
But of course we all know that there's no silver bullet, and the characters here, though the course of this emotionally moving film, learn of that meaning as it applies in their own, with the old man determined to take a more proactive approach, to a connection between a father and a son, to love found and running parallel to that, a love broken because of sacrifices that one has to make, or the lack thereof, and the maturing of a young child.
The film ends on a positive note though with two of its characters teaching themselves to swim like a dolphin from a self help book.
It's generally compelling and filled with typically intense performances - Christopher Walken and Annabella Sciorra from Ferrara's THE ADDICTION (1995), Chris Penn, Vincent Gallo and Benicio Del Toro (though some of the over-the-top histrionics, usually involving Penn's bad-tempered character, do raise the occasional unintended chuckle).
By the way, though I rented THE FUNERAL from my local DVD outlet as part of a 2-Disc Set with THE ADDICTION, I was actually the one to have brought it over to him from London!
Some of the film's violent highlights, though, include a stabbing in the heart with a butcher knife, shooting two innocent truck drivers with a shotgun, raping a teenage prostitute (who sold her soul) and an ending pistol massacre.
Yukie deserves high accolades for this movie, and even though she never won an award for it, she won one from me.
How he got to be a master of horror is beyond me (though one would assume from "The Howling").
It's no surprise that Steven Spielberg often had a hand in the making of many of his films, though Dante infuses his own offbeat style to the proceedings; Dante's got a agreeable sentimental streak, but he's also got an anarchic one too, something that would reach full crazy fruition with Gremlins 2.
It's difficult to find a purely entertaining movie that not only has no flaws whatsoever, but whose virtues are almost consistently wonderful, but InnerSpace might be the one; Dennis Quaid never quite made it as a big A-list star, but here's he wonderfully likable, despite of (actually, maybe because of) his cockiness and smart attitude, and he manages to register a consistent strong presence throughout the film, even though he spends most of the time trapped in his tiny ship, thanks to his performance and his excellent chemistry with Martin Short, who never quite hit the jackpot in another film quite the way he does here.
If you enjoy suspending disbelief and you appreciated "Gremlins", then this new offering form executive producer Steven Spielberg and director Joe Dante is guaranteed to keep you thoroughly entertained for over two hours (though you won't believe you've been sitting down that long).
Second billing really should go to Kevin McCarthy (though his is a small role) for his eccentric portrayal of Scrimshaw, the megalomaniac criminal who is 'just in it for the money'.
There are some interesting scenes of the insides of Short, though one has to wonder why they would have a device to attach to the inner ear of the bunny as I do not think you can talk to a bunny.
The eye part though makes sense though.
This film though for the most part worked, especially when it was being a comedy.
It really is Quaid's film though, personal favourite lines including "Dip, Dip, Dip all you like.
The gunfights are not good though, not very realistic at all.
Still though you get to see gals in shorts and an alligator attack scene...wow, talk about action.
I like KURUPT though.
One thing I might say though, is that while the characters are great in their own respective story lines, they lack chemistry between each other.
I do wonder, though, how a show about four strong, assertive women working at a meat packing plant would do?
A shocking entry for Akitarou Daichi, the man responsible for the delightfully funny ANIMATION RUNNER KUROMI, this thirteen-episode mini-series is often disturbing with nary a lighthearted moment; at the same time, though, it is very intriguing and interesting to watch.
All in all, though, it works pretty well for this kind of show.
The one thing that stops this movie from excelling in that category though is that it has quite a few really revolting bits in it.
Even though the story is pretty bad, I still got interested in it and I was excited to see what happened next which is a testament to Corman's technical skill in handling material.
I agree about a lot of the slapstick being out of place (though not even all of THAT).
His Evita song was OK though.
During two hours you can enjoy lovely Joseph (with Donny Osmond, of course), clever Variations (very artistically played by Julian Lloyd Webber), dramatic Evita (only Paige's unique voice can reveal full splendor of Don't cry for me Argentina, and Antonio Banderas is the best Che ever), dynamic Starlight Express, solemn Requiem, passionate Jesus Christ Superstar (even though this musical is not among my favourite Webber's works I couldn't but admire Michael Ball singing Gethsemane), beautiful and mysterious The Phantom of the Opera with exquisite Sarah Brightman as Christine and Banderas proving that he can act Eric (AND HE CAN!
Cool score, though.
No matter though this movie is disgusting.
Here, though, as the Swede sailor Ole, he fits perfectly.
Even though it was filmed at the California Tiffany studios it certainly had an authentic English feel to it.
Even though she is given top billing she is not given much to do - she does look very exotic though.
The most fascinating part, though, is that this movie was made in 1933 and Ten Little Indians was published in 1939.
The main difference though is the high level of quality in the action of the HK movies.
I just got that new Dragon Dynasty version of the film, though I'd never seen it before last night.
Haven't watched any of the extras yet, though from what I've read here this is the "downbeat" Cantonese cut of the film.
I must admit I'm disappointed in the film, though can still justify a decent score.
There were a lot of problems with the editing and stunt-work though.
Now even though the terrible, and I mean TERRIBLE computer graphics bothered me, the plot of this movie is even worse.
Granted, it's been over 10 years since I've seen it (though I'm downloading it right now... found it on Sharaza, hence my urge to look it up here), but it quickly became the standard all other XXX movies had to live up to, since (most don't hold my interest for more than ten minutes.
The beginning was enough to hook me; I knew this wasn't going to be your typical hard-core movie (though the uncut version is very hard-core).
This is the first episode to 'star' one of the shuttlecraft (though one figured prominently in ''The Menagerie').
Spock's in command of the 7-member landing party of the shuttlecraft, though this landing was unplanned.
They play off each other very well & even though Sellick used this as a springboard for his entire career, Hillerman is most often remembered for this show.
The lead (Yukie Nakama as a shy Sadako) is very good, even though it's obvious she's a Japanese version of Carrie White; misunderstood, creepy and with gifts she never wanted.
And I said that no matter what I have to see some of his movies even though their titles gave me quite a clear idea what they were all about and the total of 187 and growing number of movies meant that they were a very sloppy job.
La Fille de Dracula certainly feels sloppy and unable to keep itself focused on one genre, as the IMDb lists it as horror, mystery and even romance, though I failed to notice either of these genres on screen.
The film is decent on all levels though it never breaks down the barriers of brilliance.
I have a cousin who is autistic she is not as bad as Charlie the character though and she can be a handful and quite annoying at stages and i never ever saw it from the other point of view.
With a title like 13 EROTIC GHOSTS I was under no illusion what sort of film I'd be watching - A rather threadbare plot revolves around a bunch of supernatural investigators finding out about ghostly happenings after a girls school is struck by lightening and burns down in a special effects sequence that wouldn't look out of place in the cheapest DOCTOR WHO production   As you can imagine this threadbare plot is just an excuse to show some lesbian love action and despite the sex scenes not being up to the erotic standard of ALLYSON IS WATCHING the sex scenes are fairly good for this type of genre though to be overly critical there's maybe not enough boy on girl action   13 EROTIC GHOSTS doesn't take itself too seriously and does contain this memorable exchange :   " You know she reminds me of my old Co in 'Nam .
The discarded luggage at the films end, though a nice bow at the end of the package, felt sudden, not unresolved, just sudden.
Maybe Schwartzman as screen-writer wasn't the best idea, then again Coppla's "CQ" was okay at best, so who knows where it went wrong, and though it could have been worse, and wasn't that bad, it just left me kinda disappointed.
I can see how people could like this though, some of it feels like "Bottle Rocket", another beloved Anderson film I was't too thrilled with.
This isn't navel-gazing (though there's that) but also discovery and wonderment.
Schwartzman is already Jack, though the film was completed a year earlier.
I am a fan of Wes Anderson, even though his movies generally leave me with a feeling of numbness on first viewing, and a sense of uncertainty as to whether or not I thought the film was any good from a plot and character standpoint.
It was an eyeopener for me, and though it caused a lot of upheaval in the media the next day, it showed that times where changing and that people no longer let there lives be ruled by others but made choices for themselves.
It is VERY brief, though.
Standing out, though, is possibly the greatest French actor of the 1930s, Louis Jouvet, the funniest straight man in the film, keeping his gloriously calm poker-face through all kinds of humiliations and revelations, including the donning of an elaborate kilt to find an incriminating picture from an 'actress'.
There are plenty of units and associated gib effects to make up for that though.
Strange and mildly bloody Belgian-French-Dutch horror comedy romp that was distributed by Troma Pictures has black comedy and some gore even though some of the gore was heavily cut out to avoid an "X" rating here in America.
The three sides are remarkable in how even they are(though it should be noted that the way they are set up is essentially an idea from earlier RTS titles, including StarCraft), and all have some interesting stuff to play around with, as well as an arsenal that makes them formidable foes, and satisfying to play as.
The level design is good, but for only having seven missions per side, few of them are terribly memorable(though there are some interesting scenarios, such as providing cover-fire for retreating US troops, and all three sides get a reasonably satisfying finale).
I own this movie on VHS and have been waiting a long time for a much deserved DVD release..the acting is superb and you really feel as though you are spending time with old friends every time you watch this masterpiece.
Just remember to accept it for what it is though.
The late Michael Hutchence was the best choice to play Sam; though the film is a true story, it seems as if the role were written for Hutchence.
The only comedy side to this film is that when the killing starts the people act as though its nothing out of the ordinary.
The story is weak though...not much original.
It's almost as though he's (poorly)reading a Teleprompter in many scenes.
I was though pleasantly surprised not only was it a good film but Dracula was amazing.I was glad to see that they had kept most of the same cast as they all are amazingly talented actors and actresses.I was glad to see DG (I cant spell his actual name) back and as brooding as ever, he is defiantly my favourite character in the film and has been ever since i saw ascension.
They could have shown and explained it much better though.
The actual musical performances from guests Eddie Vedder and Tom Morello and Steve Earle are fantastic though, with Roseane Barr and the other musician in Tennessee just OK (Viggo Mortensen is a nice surprise).
Pretty stirring in places, with some good live music thrown in, MM is an excellent orator - let's just hope he never becomes a politician - even though he's got the chops for it - because he is the living proof that to hope is to be an American.
Even though the dialog is sometimes overly hammy, and the dubbing kinda crappy, it kinda makes the movie's ridiculous charm that much more noticeable.
It's a very minor criticism though.
The story, though embellished somewhat from the truth, still carries an important message of simple humanity and dignity.
I was about to go to sleep as it was about 00-40 in the morning and I flicked over to the movie and even though I was falling asleep as I flicked over to it, within five minutes I was wide awake and totally captivated.
it wouldnt be called a top 25 of all-time film by the public (though i may place it there), however, based solely on the fact that it, as i mentioned earlier, is lacking in terms of typical "entertainment" value.
even though you will certainly be immersed the entire way through.
Even though, since... i've seen hundreds of gory films, but this one is still implanted in my head, possibly because it was my first.
Even though his audience views John Merrick as not the average person because of his medical condition, the story is cherished because of how it is put onto the big screen.
I would be pretty happy, though, if Valdez had blown off R L Davis's (Richard Jordan) head, because he is one slimy little creep of a coward who richly deserved it.
Also, the film ended very well, though I don't want to spoil anything by saying more about it.
Burt Lancaster(who I just thought was great, though he battled with the accent just a bit..a minor squabble)portrays Bob Valdez, a former Apache hunter for the Calvary now a constable who accidentally shoots an innocent black man claimed to have murdered the husband of Gay Erin(the beautiful redheaded Susan Clark).
I still can't feature Burt as a Mexican, though.
Most of the movie is pure comedy though, with such scenes as one of the grannies wearing a suit of armour (dunno why), a fat man getting his arse eaten and a little boy saying, "That's smashing!"
I was wrong though.
Just the rich sisters kind of thing I think even though Alysons more the actress, in this movie Amanda michalka was okay sometimes but Alysons acting stunk.
the acting from both girls were great and though i was just a little disappointed with the ending it didn't change my mind at all that this was a very respectable movie, and it definitely stood out as being "original" in "disney channel original movie".
Charles Grodin does a performance of a lifetime as Lenny.Same thing with Jeannie Berlin as Lila, who's Elaine May's daughter.Cybill Shepherd portrays Kelly Corcoran in a memorable way.And so does Eddie Albert as her father.Audra Lindley is wonderful as her mother.Doris Roberts does a small role as Mrs.Cantrow.Grodin's character is somewhat likable even though he acts like a real jerk.You can't help but feel sorry for this man.I mean, this gorgeous college girl wants him!
Also, be sure to check some of the carvings in his face...a lot of cute in-jokes there as well ;)  A fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously (so neither should you), though it does lag a bit in a few places.... 9/10
though made in 1972, the subtle and sometimes blatant humor, and the addition of an ex bachelor suffering from a regretful commitment, truly creates a more real relationship dilemma that seems to be missing in more modern chick flicks.
But the way the film progresses from one brilliantly written scene to another, we can't wait to see what will transpire next, and we somehow end up caring so much for everyone in the film (even though they often don't care all that much for each other!)
A lot of cute office shtick in the beginning (though nothing you haven't seen done better in "Clerks" and "Office Space"), but the climatic story of the office-snitch is what killed it for me.
Even though we went to the Saturday viewing at the butt crack of dawn, but it was well worth it.
I will say, though, that Jensen Ackles stole every scene in which he appeared.
I do have to wonder, though, if Priestly has lived happily ever after...
Even though I am a Jensen Ackles fan, that wasn't the only reason I loved Ten Inch Hero.
While the story is a bit convoluted about her actual prison record, she is sentenced to 5 years, even though I doubt this would occur, as she had minor non-violent crime (apparently).
Apparently, though, no one has any civil rights, and one guard named Stu is found dead, a staged suicide; he was murdered by one of the prison staff to protect their jobs.
even though this contains a spoiler alert I can't bring myself to describe the ending - you simply must see it.
Both fall in love and spend all their time together--even though their love is fated to end before its time.
The joy of this film though are Aline MacMahon and Frank McHugh.
I personally love Fellini's absurdity and artful touch, and though this is often viewed as a mostly problematic film, I always find it quite unique and influential for the many following film directors of world cinema.
Certain sequences (particularly the red light district near the beginning) feel as though we are on some kind of dark ride, gliding past a series of rooms containing all manner of curiosities.
Ultimately, if there is any sort of plot it probably revolves around a young man trying to find himself (or his sexuality) though different occurrences.
Ultimately, if there is any sort of plot it probably revolves around a young man trying to find himself (or his sexuality) though different occurrences.
When the final freeze (frieze) occurs, you feel as though you have awakened from a pleasant dream that made sense only in the fact that it was pleasant.
What follows though is pure visual brilliance.
I saw this Fellini film on TV, in pan and scan, and even though SATYRICON has to be seen on widescreen format, the cropped version was still mighty impressive to look at.
There is plenty of action and comedy here too, though not much in the way of horror.
Just a warning though; it is slow paced, even more so than Ringu, a complaint many people seem to have with these movies, and the first time i watched it i wasn't sure if it was leading anywhere.
The film begins in modern day Japan- someone has heard a rumour about a videotape with a curse... then we flashback 30 years or so and meet the Evil Spirit Sadako...only to find she is a beautiful young woman, a talented actress though shy, and misunderstood.
Be prepared for some disappointment about the movie as a whole, though...
"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" though a fairy tale film of wonder, excitement and joys of unexpected moments broadens it's themes more in depth by showing the joys of life and love.
The film even though long moves well with it's journey of drama and life discovery for Benjamin as it's memorable for his working and making a living on a tugboat.
There's a sadness to this story, especially near the end but overall, even though it's central theme seems to be "death," I don't think it's a depressing film.
Throughout though many of the different actors and actresses lit up the screen.
Despite that though it this film was done very well and I would recommend it to all.
His loyalty pays off, though, when circumstances bring them together again at a time when they both happen to be the same age - a fleeting moment, and one they will cherish.
This movie is probably not for everyone though.
Even though the storyline is not unique, Mr. Anderson has brought a fresh approach to the film.
But, this movie is just not funny; even though the script keeps telling you how side-splitting it is, and how you're enjoying it more than you did "Animal House" or "Porky's".
So Gonzer is just some college guy coasting through life, though this time it's with food and his best friend (in this movie), Irwin.
Not really that gory though.
Not really that gory though.
If you're the average IMDB reader, you probably enjoy a good action movie every now and then, but you approach action films with a certain caution and skepticism (I can't blame you, even though I am an action junkie myself).
Ragnar Tornquist's script, though, is hugely ambitious, and mostly successful; it has a superb premise - essentially a pair of worlds, one futuristic, the other a place of post-Tolkeinish fantasy, and with a heroine (April Ryan) who finds herself shifting, at first unwillingly, between the two.
The sad thing though, is that it hasn't been really integrated and didn't have a chance to be.
That's because this film is much more plot driven and character driven than most silent comedies--and that works well for me, though you might miss the more acrobatic and violent character he plays in his shorts and in some of his full-length ones.
Somehow though, the endless boozing and schmoozing doesn't affect the band on stage and they look like the great louche rockers they were by this point.
Still it is interesting to watch and you should get it with The Scorsesee Collection to see how a gifted filmmaker grew from this film to Goodfellas, arguably his best film (though a legitimate case could be Raging Bull, but you need to buy another collection to get that one).
It is a triumph of style over substance, though the substance comes damn near close to the style of Scorsese's direction that is later seen in his other triumphs (you get the feeling you've seen every type of shot before in this film if you've seen other Scorsese pictures).
The topper for me though was when Pidge fired the errant shot and threw the gun across the room, and Johnny Baron didn't bother to worry about who might go after it.
What's really cool about the film, though, is how honestly he portrays these sociological nuances.
This short, nominated for an Academy Award, (I'm surprised it lost, though I've never seen the winner, as far as I know) is a funny, sad, sweet look at life through the eyes of a child growing up in Canada.
Skyhawks was one of my favorite cartoons, though it was on all too briefly.
Jeb's family disappeared when he was a boy - though he doesn't know how or why.
Mitchum smolders, as usual, though his character here is just a thumbnail sketch, and the melodrama inherent in this scenario is far beneath him.
She's first billed in this picture even though the film is really about Mitchum.
It's almost frustrating, seeing everyone chase after Robert Mitchum even though the man has nothing wrong!
I personally love the show and find the cynicism of Rimmer, the dead pan of Holly and the Bewilderment of lister to be extremely funny though i must add, i've never really been that amused by anything the cat has ever said (though i wouldn't want him removed from the gang) The show is funny, unique and in many cases, quite complex in it's structure and story arcs.
Bringing back the entire crew, including the Captain, was a mistake though ( as was the retaining of Kochanski ).
Even though this was when they were still (pretty much) confined to the Red Dwarf ship, the scripts and dialogues were absolutely fantastic.
The music though seems directly inspired by such classic Hitchock scores as that in Vertigo.
There are a number of plot points that must be gotten through and which are better indicated in Frances Marion's script than in the 1937 version ... even though some points seem to be skipped over, they are butchered worse in the sound version.
Even though her character makes some mistakes in the beginning, she has a big heart, and lots of love for her beloved daughter.
The action is well cut, though i would have liked it to be a bit less "shaky" but it seems this trend will have to develop to its extreme before it starts to vanish again (hopefully soon i wanna see the effort the actors and stuntman put into their swordplay more clearly!).
More importantly, though, is that the film is competently made.
Again, though, the rest of the effects are good enough to cover for this slight blunder.
Whatever, though - the box office opportunity was wasted because someone or other didn't have faith in humanity (I mean seriously, anyone with a droplet of testosterone in them would find this highly entertaining, so of course there's a market for it), but this movie's cult status is assured.
I was very pleasantly surprised though.
All the encounters with it are really gory, though, so I do not recommend it for the faint-hearted.
Frank Sinatra is excellent as the bad guy, though his scripted lines are frequently absurd.
What lifts this though is a great cast, tight filming, good production, and above all that some heart and soul that's been missing.
I enjoyed watching Tick Tock even though it has some flaws, the ending being the major one.
This time, though, there is no explanation as to why the force is calling her in particular, or even what the force really is and how it has the power to do what it does.
One of the many cartoons from the days when Porky Pig was the top Warner Bros. cartoon star - though Daffy Duck would soon overtake him - "Porky's Railroad" looks to me like a parable of many American's hopes during the Depression.
Because I want to discuss some of the details of this short, this is a spoiler warning:   This is an interesting little short, though there's very little that's all that special, save for Frank Tashlin using some tricks usually reserved for live-action film rather than cartoons.
It was pointed out on this thread, in another review, that the film seems like a "B" feature, even though Sterling Hayden plays the sheriff, and James Gleason plays a retired Secret Service Agent.
The worse part of the show are the birthday girls, if the slight possibility of the party being too expensive and it having to be made cheaper arises, even though it is still 10 times more than most people could afford, they cry a bloody river until they get their way.
They should start showing normal families who maybe only have a few thousand dollars saved up for their kid's sweet 16, and how even though they had a limited budget, it was still a night to remember.
The script is tight and fast-moving, though the setups are a little too obvious and the payoffs a little too predictable, and the storytelling sometimes feels rushed.
It's a real shame, because these kids are very ungrateful, even though their family has more money than just about most other families in the entire world.
The biggest problem though has got to be with the parents.
One of the biggest problems though, is that this isn't the only show that makes the yanks look like a bunch of idiots, Laguna Beach, Rich Girls, The Hills + countless other reality TV.
Interestingly, he even saw fit to steal from himself Â since JONATHAN OF THE BEARS (1993) bears {sic} more than a cursory nod to the latter; another thing he was prone to doing was reviving popular mythical figures, such as the disastrous SINBAD OF THE SEVEN SEAS (1989) and the TV mini-series THE RETURN OF SANDOKAN (1996; which I recently acquired but have yet to check out) Â though, in all fairness, he did muster a fairly successful re-imagining of Homer's "The Illiad" in gangland terms with the little-known spoof HECTOR THE MIGHTY (1971).
However, there's little to say about the crass commercial thinking that went into the making of THE LAST SHARK (by the way, Castellari had already made the even sillier THE SHARK HUNTER [1979]); the greatest insult, though, is that the film-makers couldn't hope to raise the budget (most likely, they didn't even have the inclination!)
James Franciscus was likable as the police chief even though he was copying Roy Scheider's character.
There's a ton of style injected into these proceedings, plus plenty of Castellari slow motion, and the usual gore (though not so much as Jaws).
At the end of the day though, it's still a blatant rip-off of Jaws, and the low budget rears its head whenever shark footage appears, with some dodgy models and terrible stock footage.
The shark itself is an engaging creation, even though it's over-the-top gigantic and a little too robotic-looking when it pops out of the water.
Hence the second viewing with the less obtrusive though inaccurate ones.
wow - this movie is mind-blowing in so many ways... it's on a ranking with the best of world cinema, and is not merely transgressive (though be aware -- it is extremely transgressive).
You will not have seen anything like Singapore Sling -- it is a work of beauty though it bears repeated viewings to assimilate everything it has to offer.
All in all, though, it's great.
The film only features three performers, but it never gets boring even though the film runs for over 110 minutes.
The performances by the mother/daughter team are completely believable - same for Singapore (though he's mainly silent throughout the film).
Not saying they weren't nuts before, but I'm guessing father wouldn't have approved of everything they're now doing....even though father was a murderer.
It is DEFINITELY bad though.
The fight scenes are nothing that special, though they are exceptionally well filmed, and our heroes leap around the screen in a way that doesn't seem inappropriate or false - you believe in the world of these people.
THe location of the movie offered great colors and excellent views even though i still don't know where it was filmed!!!
It is unfortunate that the only DVD versions that are available are in pretty poor shape (though, I must add, not in as bad shape as the more recently filmed Ashes of Time by Wong Kar Wai).
The plot is very long and complex - though perfectly understandable, and even logical - therefore I do not see any real interest in retelling it here.
So she leaves him though she knows she is still in love with him, and then her world shatters when she hears he is dead.
Heck, you can even download more tools to customize, if you want to do something that the regular editor, that comes with the game, won't let you(though there is precious little that fits into that category... it's incredibly open and, as stated earlier, jam-packed with features).
Also, though the games does have a number of in-game tips, it can be fiendishly hard, and there's only one instructional tutorial, and it doesn't cover much.
Overall even though I might have expected a little too much from "Steel Trap" it nevertheless is pretty mediocre, so would I truly recommend it?
If you really want to see a good movie staring Denise Richards, see "Starship Troopers" or "The World Is Not Enough" (even though most people didn't like her in the latter).
We all know that Tammy and the T-Rex is not meant to be in the IMDb top 250 but it sure as hell does not deserve to be in the bottom 100.Ill admit there are some cheesy and really what the f*** parts, but it is actually a entertaining film.This was recommended to me by a friend who likes movies like me so i watched this expecting the biggest piece of trash ever.Instead i got a somewhat good film.Denise Richards and Paul Walker play really good parts and though the plot seems very absurd, it not that bad.If your ever watching this just sit down and try and enjoy it.You might actually like it.
I know there are those who champion The Idiot and No Regrets for Our Youth, and even the one film I had previously seen from the set, I Live in Fear, is quite good (though it's hard to argue with it being a lesser film is such an outstanding oeuvre).
That wouldn't be too surprising, though, as film audiences rarely interact with characters on screen.
This is certainly not the best Japanese movie ever, there are a bit too much technical flaws (could partially have been due to a bad tape though, I've seen it on the Brussels BIFFF festival), and a bit too many clichÃ©'s in the plot, and the gore was a bit too soft(for a movie advertised as a horror movie, that is) it doesn't really have something to stand out from the rest of the new Japanese movie....except for its atmosphere...really liked the atmosphere, which had a lot to do with the decors, which were very well put together.... the two people who I went to see the movie with hated it, mainly for the flaws I've mentioned before, but I guess this is a typical case of "if you concentrate too much on the flaws you'll hate it, otherwise it just might grab you, and you're in for a very enjoyable ride"  So to be brief: I loved it but I can't really recommend it...still I'll give it an 8, mainly to promote a talented filmmaker which I'm sure will deliver a few brilliant movies if he gets the budget he deserves
Apparently she's never encountered a real one, though.
There are some positives though.
for not really getting organized, not engaging in politicking, not being charming when in the public eye, insulting the other side and acting as though the subject is not worthy of debate rather than respecting its dignity and engaging in reasonable debate, and for not really explaining to the public its position and exactly why it's a bad idea to "teach" ID in science class.
As far as (1) goes, even though it seems pretty obvious to me why ID shouldn't be taught in science class, the film doesn't do much to explain why it's so obvious.
This brings me to my point: Randy, though I found his documentary enjoyable, failed to ask an obvious question that I feel strikes directly at the heart of the current debate.
That's carping, though.
Even though some of the things you see may be a bit graphic, the movie dosen't hold back.
For example, Jewish people are prohibited from practicing medicine and a cardiologist is reduced to cleaning toilets, though does so with good humour, grace, and dignity.
Special mention should go to Justus von Dohnanyi, though, who played the Nazi Commandant "Preuss."
Even though Darcy warns Michael, "Men don't really want to be with me, they only think they do," the two begin a relationship against their better judgment.
This film really starts, though, as a drama, telling us the story of Sadako in a very linear fashion (which, deliciously, has become the more difficult and confusing path to take, since we already know the end of the story).
The dialog is very believable, many things that are said aren't true, though the characters might want to believe they are.
These characters seem to be L.A. "slackers", though at least we see the main character at work upon occasion.
I had to laugh though, although many complain about the gratuitous female nudity, this film did slip with the editing of the male nudity, making that seem gratuitous - but in an era where all the Hollywood actress spend half a movie naked and having sex with fully clothed men, it was nice just to see some male nudity (when was the last time you saw a post-80s Hollywood movie with as much male bare chest as in Ben Hur?!)!
The fire scene at the end was hilarious though.
The movie went by pretty quick, though it repeated many of its sequences.
I wondered if the rest of their relationship was strong enough to pass the test of time though, sex seemed to be at the core of their love.
You have to let yourself be carried away though or you might become saturated yourself, with the abundance of symbolism and sex.
They too were apparently genetically modified, but that seemed to be a completely irrelevant subplot (though I probably missed something important concerning that...)  My advice, don't watch the movie!
Action in the movie though sparse is terrific, handled brilliantly from a point of direction and filled with power and excitement.
Quite nicely done though.
The movie has some memorable moments in it and the movie is consistent enough to consider this movie a watchable as well as a very enjoyable one, that unfortunately can not conceal that the two boys already had their best years behind them though.
Overall, it was unbearable to watch even though the runtime is only 70 minutes.
There are some dodgy ones though (i'm not keen on 'moving people' or 'helping hands' much) but the games and players are always different so you never get bored.
Don't expect too many absolute answers here though.
Don't be fooled, though.
It's only a vehicle for his art, though certainly a favored one, owing to fact he spent most of his life in French prisons.
His gaze, though, is explicitly fetishised - he is made complicit in what he sees.
Try some Leguizamo or catch some "slam jam" poetry or old "Robin" (or new "Old Robin") and don't worry, we won't tell your mom that you laughed your _ _ _- off even though "that language" was used.
You of course have to be open to these sort of movies though.
There's another classic cameo by Begum Para who binds her granddaughter Sakina to herself, with a safety-pin whenever she sleeps and watches Mughal-e-Azam even though she's almost blind.
the ending is a bit IFFY and OPEN ended i guess.... well thats the reason why i liked the movie....though i bet Sanjay leela Bhansali dint intend the movie to imply so.... Anyways I don't Think of Sanjay Leela Bhansali as a terrific Director though KHAMOSHI made me cry like hell....and moreover he was the one who hired ASH and Salman in his SUPERB film Hum dil De....WHo are both the WORST actors India has ever seen... anyways i hope Sanjay leela Bhasnsali gets a Original script and SOME Better actors to work on his next movie.... getting back to Saawariya... One thing that cant be denied is that this is a very important movie in the History of India... many Firsts in this movie....
I was truly mesmerized after watching this film last night, though many of my friends warned me not to and i can understand why.
And it's not too taxing on the brains too-just a simple love story set in a far-far away land, narrated with flow and music, though at the end of it you might question the essence of Sonam's character.
An amazing movie on the whole though, it had me enthralled every step of the way, and I'd be content for the rest of my move going days if I could simply see a few films like this a year.
He rents an apartment above O's to observe him and rents his favorite films from the neighborhood video rental store even though he doesn't own a VCR.
The real stand out though is the music...  Graham Gouldman really outdid himself with some real slamming tunes.
They are suitable for most ages, though I wouldn't advise letting kids who are too young play them, and you can get a good laugh without too many inappropriate or suggestive comments.
Talk about remedial education though, this is really stretching it.
Here's my quote though: "I think Mr.Mandella smoked my drugs!"
This is nothing but sentimental, contrived schlock, which fails on all levels...though it DOES have heart.
Needless to say, when the entire top of a building blows up, you can expect that Ms. Porcupine did not even get singed even though she was standing about a foot away from the Giant Spider.
One thing is for certain, the ending of the game is so ridiculously over the top that I'm pretty sure the game-series has reached some kind of conclusion (though CMI is still the pinnacle).
Even though I miss Alexandra Boyd's lovely British accent, her replacement Charity James does a good job with Elaine, though truth be told I liked her performance as Grace Nakimura in Gabriel Knight 3 better.
A few points of criticism are in order though.
Monkey Kombat in Act III, though fun may seem rather tedious to some gamers.
")I do admit one thing though, It was so bad that I watched the whole thing.
Particularly effective is Harry Andrews, as a wealthy elderly eccentric who fell in love with Dame Wendy's character decades earlier, though they met only fleetingly.
this movie is full of action and suspense from the beggining, it has special effects like you expect to see in big blockbuster hits and even though the acting is a little on the over the top side its made up for by the brilliant gore and spider special effects.
He freely ad-libs dialogue between the songs & appears to be enjoying himself immensely - even though the restrictions of the microphone and the static camera require him to keep still & not move about.
Even though his track record of churning out great movies is definitely uneven, there's always something about his films, good or bad, that I like.
And though I usually respect the critical judgments of the late William K. Everson Â who said Arthur Wontner was one of the two best actors ever to play Holmes Â he's never convinced me in the role.
The movie could have been executed better even though a novel idea.
Anyhow he decide to do that though he was very practical in Business, and leaves for America  How and What happens is the basic concept of story and the title song "Yun Hota.." is very melodious(to me) and is nicely presented.
Even though the movie was short, I felt that quite a few frames were wasted and did not need to be there.
The part that truly breaks my heart, though, is this: in the interview with Freddie Mercury, the interviewer asks "Do you think Queen will still be around in ten years?"
Here though it's more a recollection from his youth, a sunny tale from an idyllic 1960's summer that turns dark before the story ends.
What i appreciated most though was the acting, from both child-actors and adults.
It's determined that Houghland was murdered, even though there wasn't a mark on him, and the police are called in and seal off the mansion where this TV demonstration was taking place to prevent the murderer from escaping.
This is a nice little horror/mystery, even though a little short at under an hour.
Even though Jackie Chan is not in the movie, it is quite enjoyable.
The plot is not very clever, and though some of the characters are interesting (particularly the male lead and his two masters), they all dissolve into not very clever and not-as-funny-as-they-could-have-been stereotypes once the central plot comes into focus.
So overall, a slightly worse than average flick, though for Bogart a sincere effort but a miss nevertheless.
Meant to be a breakout movie for John Derek, "Knock on Any Door" is sometimes noted to be his debut film, though he had a couple of credits to his name by this time.
It stars Humphrey Bogart in his first film after leaving Warner Brothers, though it comes off like a Warner Brothers film made in the 1930s - it has a real "Dead End Kids" feel to it, particularly in the beginning.
Ahead of it's time, even though very dated now, "Knock on any Door" gets into the background of it's accused killer like a scalpel used by a neurosurgeon goes into the brain of his patient.
Even though I'm sure it was great that David Banner accomplished something himself without Hulking out, but hey!
No extras, though.
This didn't bother me though, it made the movie even more bizarre and dreamlike, somewhat European.
i doubt it though as most of these eighty's films usually age badly, it would be good to know if i can own this film on DVD.
A plain, somewhat overweight, nerdy-looking man stands on the edge of the roof of the Don Hotel (no "tiny bubbles" jokes in the movie, though).
In the hospital, he's rehabilitated, though he now walks with a cane and limp.
And the third shows us that there is hope even though those who provide it -- especially one nun -- has to turn her back on God to save his children.
The prologue is a perfect example of a warm, vibrant image giving way to a shocking one: Teenage boys of an African tribe cover their bodies with a pale paste, un-self-consciously helping each other, though they are naked.
And though the DVD box trumpets the presence of Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, you better not blink if you don't want to miss them.
Daniels does have the charisma for the action hero though.
The song during the final credits is probably one of the best parts though.
Therefore when she gets a chance to go to another school to coach football she grabs it, even though the players are less than refined and practically stink at the game.
He looks like he was only 38 even though, at the time, he was actually 68!
Okay, the film gets a 3 even though it's duller than dust because back in 1898, ALL the films were duller than dust--having NOT AN OUNCE OF PLOT--consisting of people doing mundane stuff that thrilled audiences at the time but would hopelessly bore people today because films are so omnipresent.
It's hard to tell, though, what with the jumbled up way the story was presented.
Well, it is funny at times, though this is not the point here, because it is supposed to be political rather than funny.
Exposing the hypocrisy of the conservatives and the FCC though is interesting enough.
The draw back to F*ck is though it covers a lot of ground, it doesn't dig very deep into each sections.
The ending is left with only two characters left - hopefully they're compatible (though I will admit the Blond was very annoying), because it seemed very much as though they were headed towards an uninhabited planet to start a new life as the only survivors.
The first time i saw this in the early 90's I loved it and I recently re-watched it (2002) and still loved it, it lost a bit of it's surprise though.
H E R E B E S P O I L E R S The captain tells Dick Berry that they're all over a hundred years old though they look like they're much younger.
The story is well written and beautifully photographed, and the director keeps the pace up through the film, substituting mood for cheap shocks, though there are a few jump-out-of-your-seat moments.
My husband said that when it started out, SV "seemed happy and pretty much OK for a while", but from almost the first shot of SV talking about how this is a great job for her because she loves sex and how the porn industry "is the only job where she would get people telling her she's sexy and beautiful", it was obvious that though she is smiling and sounding positive, but really just trying deep down to convince herself that she's happy.
I was quite right, though.
Everything seemed just a little too easy though I am aware it is in the culture of the supporting cast to positively adjust to change.
When I was a teen, there was a moment when I "got it" that the Japanese people and their culture were worthy of respect, even though the Japanese "think weird."
Notice that Dean Cain's hairstyle as Superman is swept back just as George Reeve's was, even though the character never wore it that way in the comics.
I think the real genius behind The New Adventures of Superman though was Lex Luthor.
Superman is the hero, but he never acted as though he was more important than anyone else.
Even though Teri was at the time married to Jon Tenney, who guest starred on Lois and Clark for a few episode as a kinda bad guy however is character was hard to define.
Even though Superman was a superhero he never felt he was above anyone.
the first ski school was an entertaining funny comedy that just clicked on all the right cylinders this one has none of the cleverness of the first one..Wendy hamilton is a good distraction though.
Not hard to tell why though.
This may have been the worst Royal Rumble Match ever though.
This was the best match on the card though, but not too impressive.
10 minutes long wasn't so long though.
the winner was Rey mysterio a bit of a shock and sorta of un believable though.
a nice 9out of 10 cena vs edge was an OK math i sorta knew that cena would win though but thats OK. 8 out 10 Kurt vs mark.
pretty boring match but was well fought i knew that angle would win but that didn't ruin the match completely 5out of 10 all in the ppv was pretty good i wouldn't buy it though
It was a great rumble match as usual, a bit better then last year, mostly because i was so shocked Mysterio won, even though there were rumours he would, i didn't believe it, then when he was left with Orton i was sure Orton would win, but it was Rey!
6/10 Once again i was quite at surprise with the result, even though there were rumours Cena would win it back so soon, i just couldn't see it happening.
The character's professionalism in his trade is of the highest order...the highest order in a lowly profession...though in this instance his job does have positive results in terms of assassinating a monster who took refuge in Argentina from Germany.
This is never explored, though, and we are left unmoved.
Mr. Huff looks great in this movie and though his part is short, he is seen enduring a bone-scraping torture through his bare chest that looks like evil acupuncture.
In some ways, he was the Mark Damon of the Eighties (though Mark got more notice for a little while during his heyday.)
Even though, to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including Gays in one shows, sucking American reality show.
Even though this was a super-modern state-of-the-art blockbuster, "Robin Hood" has maintained a curious innocence which still strikes me today.
In its entirety, "Robin Hood", though presenting so much hardship and violence, is as smooth and gentle as they come, just like a ferry-tale banned on celluloid.
I feel as though I am actually visiting these places that I will probably never get to see in my life.
Not to be ignored is Catherine Denueve; though her role as a French actress, Gabrielle, determined to save Marie was small, it was critical, and she pulled it off brilliantly.
"East/West" is an entertaining watch for all and, though fictional, offers a sense of what the Cold War was about.
Whether the story the film was based on was true or not, I thought the performances of all the actors and actresses were exceptional, the photography was excellent and overall though not a film that could be called 'enjoyable' because it was so sad, I was intensely moved and gave it 9/10.
I did find it very strange, though.
Really now, and did anyone notice that security was so tight, even though Levy's character had a police badge that he couldn't get it, but Jane got in no problem and the security lifted her right on to the stage?
During the bizarre chase, Jane accepts a ride from the limo driver because she can't wait 3 hours for the next train, even though she has more than 6 hours to get to her speech.
Even though this is 'just' a TV movie, it has the look and feel of 'real cinema'.
The 2 leads, Dixie Lee and Joe Morrison look unbelievably cute together, though Joe is a bit of a wooden actor.
It's almost as though the new blood directors are shouting "look at me" rather than "look at my story."
Don't get me wrong though, I gave this a 9!
It was cheap t Â£2.99...though the packaging looked anything but: and the striking image on the front of the box interested me.
Great visuals, simple but effective and good editing that keeps a good pace though all the film.
JSA was fantastic though so i gritted my teeth, held my breath and hoped for the best.
Even though this is fantasy it is more real than any war movie I saw.
Buckwheat's decision to call the dog "Smallpox" is rather contrived, though, as is the rest of the gang's discovery.
Tanguy made me laugh even though my understanding of French is far from perfect.
Of all the actors, though, the ones who turn in the most outstanding performances are Gavron, Rogers and, of course, Farmiga.
In real life Will could not say no when Amira is begging him because (1) he does want to help the boy, (2) she still has the power to embarrass Will and his wife even though she has given him the incriminating photo negatives, (3) it is totally out of character for him to suddenly care so much about the affair coming out, and (4) he immediately confesses it to his wife anyway.
Unlike Amira though, Liv has a husband who works very hard and can provide constant economical support to the family.
And that is exactly what Breaking and Entering is, and this time around I truly enjoyed the film even though it's far from being great.
Martin Freeman was solid as usual and Ray Winstone (though in little more than a cameo) was Ray Winstone!!
Minghella is so desperate to put some 'real people' into this phoney saga that he drags in some hapless Bosnian characters, though even they are not convincing, despite the best efforts of the ever-brilliant Juliette Binoche with her perfect Serbo-Croat accent and a superb first performance by the young Rafi Gavron as her son.
London is definitely a character though.
Against any common sense, I decided to watch another family comedy starring Eddie Murphy.On my defense, I had two excuses to do that.The first one is that Imagine That is co-written by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, responsibles for Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and its sequel.The second excuse is my continuous apology for Murphy, who I keep considering to be a great comedian, even though he keeps wasting his talent on atrocities like Norbit and Daddy Day Care.Well, unfortunately, Imagine That is another atrocity in his career.
The death scenes in HELLBENT are just as stunning as the ones in HAUTE TENSION, though it leavens the horror with enough campy humor to put it in the 'typical slasher film' category, lacking TENSION'S brute-strength and pitch-black tone.
And all though this is a film about gay men it's not a gay film.
Filmed on location during West Hollywood's annual gay Halloween parade, this gives the film a freaky feeling of even though you are surrounded by lots of people, you are still very much alone when a crazed psychopath is on the loose!!
The music was fantastic and I wish there was a soundtrack.I have never heard of most of the artists but like their music.I really like how it has a Halloween theme.The costumes were outrageous and the party blew me away and looked like a lot of fun.This is a nice alternative to watching Halloween on Halloween night(even though i'm a huge fan of J.Carpenter's film)because it gives you a choice between them.Of course I will watch them both personally.
Judging from other reviews here, it appears as though a lot of people didn't care for this film, but I really did have a good time with it.
it was kind of funny though, to see betty white, a calm harmless woman be the caretaker of a monster.
She could have done a lot better than this film though .
It was a good laugh though, some funny moments, and just looking at what happens.
It's a paradox, they actually use the finished film as a prop on the movie Schnieder would be less annoying if he wasn't grinning like a lunatic for half the film (though he can recognize which of the teens is dead from his sneaker (cause there's only 7 in town)), but McMurray is kinda funny, however not enough to stop me from writing a scathing review whilst I actually watch it to make it more fun.
It seems as though a page of script was written and shot at the same time.
He dies, thank God, and then, (even though when she said "There's a giant crocodile behind you!
Now though, I have to say I wish they hadn't bothered.
Beyond that though, it's not worth it.
I was wrong though and this turned out to be my favorite independent film by far...
Ladies, don't turn off the TV too quickly; even though the beginning may appear to be a "guy flick", this is a very moving film.
The acting is real and strong and the film-making is confident and innovative, though it's likely they had very little money as there are no dolly, crane, or steadicam shots.
Even though there are no vampires.
I've seen many documentries on Vlad Dracula, and even though this movie hits on some real points in the impailer's life I think it is more of a prequil to 1992's "Bram Stoker's Dracula" because it focuses on the love story between him and his queen almost mirroring in 90min the short prologue of Dracula '92.
When I saw it I then watched "Bram Stoker's Dracula" skiping the prologue and it worked well as one movie even though the filming style is different.
I'm finding that I like the Milkyway Image movies where Johnnie To is just a producer more than the ones where he is the director, though Breaking News was pretty good.
The casting was good, everyone played their character well (mostly), except I sort of agree with the other reviewer when they said that you really don't 'dislike' the father, even though his acts can sometimes be inappropriate.
Even those two characters have become a lot weaker though.
Most of the scenes involving the dinosaurs are exciting to watch Â particularly a nighttime assault from a hungry Allosaurus Â but there just isn't enough interaction between the humans and the dinosaurs for it to be magnificent, though I'm aware that technical restrictions would most certainly have played a part in this.
When the five adventurers suddenly discovered a means of escaping the plateau, I was convinced that it must be too soon for that, though, once again, this poor pacing might be attributed to the wealth of missing footage.
Nevertheless, though the film as a whole might not be described as masterful, the visuals effects are nothing but, and its Jurassic creations are more than enough reason to give 'The Lost World' a try.
White's daughter Paula (Bessie Love) survived an expedition there, though her father never returned.
Soon enough though upon arrival at the plateau where the original expedition traveled, dinosaurs make their appearance in quick succession.
version that has trailer & those early Edison Clay Animation Shorts & 1 other Clay thing about Dinosaurs that O'Brien didn't do though like The Edison ones.
I would advise both but buy the Image Entertainment DVD Version though if you wanna really enjoy the film.
This whole movie ties in so well with the deleted scenes of the first one, though, it is obvious the director is making this up as he goes along.
I thought the whole ice cream man uniform at the end was a little gay, though funny.
The technical achievements of the movie are the most fascinating aspect of this movie though.
Sadly, though the effects themselves are quite startling, the pacing and direction of The Lost World are merely serviceable.
I'm not sure how a film of this caliber can go so grossly overlooked, even nowadays (though, as is the case with many films, it's appreciation has been snowballing the last few years.)
A fairly lengthy film, SOG never bores but sucks you in and though it doesn't stray far away from the basic gangster genre plot lines and characters, it's got a very own feel to it.
Morricone's soundtracks are legendary for a reason and though this is certainly not one of his best, it does add a lot of class to the picture.
It is Penn though that has the heavy lifting to do, because he doesn't have the luxury of hiding behind the frenetic machinations that Oldman's character does.
He does look cartoonishly amusing galloping away with the Mexican Federales in hot pursuit though.
Other, though, than his poor accent, Berry's characterization is pretty funny, although it doesn't seem to translate well from the stage to the screen.
What else is new though?
Like I said though, people who are not necessarily from the New York area may not buy or believe these characters, but I guarantee you there are so many people like them.
Of course, no one can match Chaney; though great throughout, his scene realizing Crawford never truly loved him is emotionally wrenching.
Even though the film I saw was around an hour in length part of the storyline was missing to do with this doctor.
Aristocrats are eccentric people, though not totally unlike other human beings, and as a result have a fondness for people who are different or bizarre.
I would like to know what was cut out though.  
What it doesn't lack is high drama, though, and a few surprises.
He DOES have arms though (one with two thumbs)--he just straps them to himself.
Short as it is though, it's a weird and entertaining trip.
Chaney's performance, and maybe our instinctive support of the underdog, has the odd effect of making you hope that he wins in the end, even though he's a murderer and he plots to have Malabar's arms ripped from his body by horses.
But he's the one who ends up coming out ahead, even though he never quite knows what is going on.
I have to say though, one of the best aspects of this movie is you never quite know if what Grace is saying is the product of an unhinged mind clinging to religious beliefs almost like a drowning man to a piece of drift wood, or something more sinister.
He says this to a cute 20 something year old guy who has a girlfriend, but explains "though not gay myself, my girlfriend want to watch me get it on with another guy"!
The woman playing the wife of one of Josh's dates is at least interesting and layered in her obliviousness - almost and effective satire on L.A. working wives, though nothing in the rest of the film shows that kind of subtlety.
Plot is very simple, Amitabh is a cop who believes in the constitution of India even though his son Armaan was killed by terrorist.
The late Amrish Puri (as Chief Minister of the state), exhibits his acting skills in great style, though his role is very small.
Kareena Kapoor though still very young, plays the role of a matured person and quite admirably.
Unfortunately, I do not know the actress' name... Ehsaan Khan, though decent, resorted to over-acting in emotionally charged scene.
That's one point of view though.
Like Island of Terror, much of the picture is during daytime, though there are some effective night scenes (when not mistakenly photographed during day).
I consider Phantasm IV to be a little better than the disappointing (but still good) third entry of the series, but my issue with this one is that even though you are entertained throughout and your eyes will probably be glued to the screen, nothing really happens when you think about it.
Not that thats bad thing though.
Terence Fisher's direction is solid and efficient and he handles the film's most awkward moment, the attempted rape scene, with considerable bravery even though an understandable element of reticence, discernible also in a similar moment in Fisher's 'Frankenstein Must be Destroyed' (1969), is apparent, but works well in what I would argue is a surprisingly non misogynistic movie.
The Northern island of Fara is experiencing very warm temperatures even though it is the middle of Winter while the rest of the UK is seeing the usual Winter weather.
I couldn't help but notice that Cushing's character keeps his suit and jacket on even though it suppose to be about 100 degrees!
I suppose it isn't too terrible though because his character wasn't of much relevance to the overall story, but still).
I'd strictly recommend it to "phans" of the series though, because all others will likely despise it.
The movie's heart and soul though is Joshua Harris' portrayal of Ben.
Mads Mikkelsen's acting was brilliant as usual, though it gets tiring to always see him in the same role.
I have rarely left a movie-theater actually "moved" by a movie (often contemplating though), but this movie did it for me, leaving me thinking about my own relationship.
The graphics really are great for the SNES, though the magic spells don't look particularly great.
This does take a while though, with many weapons and spells at hand.
A few veteran actors were though wasted and could have been done away with.
Ending, though not quite happy, thrives to blend with the script.
the film made me question my so-called love for my culture.i guess now i really appreciate the culture that has been handed down.and though i may hate the communist-minded people i like the spirit.
This one actually stands on its own as a good movie, though perhaps not great as fourth in the series.
While we Americans(I say we, since I'm American even though I'm landed in Canada) tend to think of Monty Python when we think of British humor, there's also a satirical type of humor that seems to be unique to Britain.
She smiled as though plotting and walked away.
The outstanding achievement of this film, though, is to put his life into context, that he is also protector, father, dreamer, artist; and to neither airbrush, glamorize nor excuse his life.
The cast is excellent, with a great merit of young LÃ¡zaro Ramos, performing a character that has everything to lead to exageration or to a ridiculous acting; even though, LÃ¡zaro manages to bring to life in a realistic way someone who is a homosexual with feminine behaviour in some times and in other times is a scary fighter, who could deal with 3 or 4 opponents bare handed.
The main achievement of the film, though, in my opinion, is that the director wanted to show the personality of JoÃ£o Francisco, not worrying too much in telling a story.
We can understand why Francisco,later called "Madame SatÃ£" lived that way (even though we may not agree with it) , having in one hand the fascination for a fairy tale world of fantasy, with songs in French and taking care of a baby and in the other hand dealt with streetfights, robbery and eventual imprisonments in jail.
Not in a bad way though, it's just the memories of this film give me a warm, fuzzy, nostalgic feeling & i wouldn't want to spoil this by watching as an adult.
Even though the opening wedding sequence nicely sets up a scene of normality for the events that follow, it's rather overlong and a more Hitchcockian terseness would certainly have helped.
This "logic" though is not the one we commonly embrace, it is a logic of dark inevitability.
"Le Boucher" though, is first and foremost quintessential Chabrol, and as such it's less concerned with plotting than either Clouzot or Hitchcock, another cinematic forebear, the focus more specifically being the interior psychological states of his protagonists.
And the gangster thinks that the son tried to rip him off (though, other than a drive-by shooting, he doesn't seem convinced enough to stick around looking for him).
As the movie progresses, things proceed almost haphazardly as though it were a light dress rehearsal.
Unfortunately, this lame flick doesn't even deliver a little gratuitous T&A as it limps along though its trite and cliche-ridden story about a beautiful hitwoman, a bunch of money, and a broke mom and son destined for a showdown.
Believe me, though, the sound in this is excellent.
Today, though, it will seem pretty old fashioned and predictable.
They duplicate their roles from those here, though Maxwell gets a chance to run around shooting a gun, something she never had a chance to do with her 'receptionist' role in the Bonders.
The villains seem to be SPECTRE, though they're referred to by another name, Thanatos, who plan to use some kind of magnetic waves to imbalance the world.
The rest of the movie, though, is a hoot to watch.
... even though many people complain that the role should have gone to Cagney.
Since he wasn't an established star, it's not surprising he plays a supporting role though he already was being cast as a mobster in films.
The movie is in some ways a very typical Warner Brothers gangster film, though with one exception.
The person or persons that own the wrecking yard has a gold mine though.
Woody Allen here remembers his childhood, and his narration is involving, funny and moving at the same time, making you say "past times were better", even though you've never been there.
Even though I am only in my early fifties this film reminds me of that simpler time that perhaps never was.
It shows a healthy family going though the most fascinating of all things, namely ordinary living.
In my opinion, Radio Days is right up there with Annie Hall though it's different in that it's following several people's lives.
They also share great love for one another, though they quibble like all human beings do.
But something tells me that in this politically correct era in which we live, that would have been unthinkable --even though al-Qaeda would cheerfully wipe us off the map with any weapon they could field.
It is highly unlikely that the nationality of the terrorist would not have been found, though.
So you immediately think that its gonna be a sort of mix between Lau Kar-Leung's Drunken Master 2 and Mad Monkey Kung fu, although its more the monkey though than the Drunk.
The script is pretty weak, though there is some good interplay between the characters, but as it is really used mainly as a framework from which to hang the action it does its job.
Dacascos is likable enough (though i don't understand why he pulls his trousers up so high) but Hardison steals the show with some great lines.
So his Eddie in 16 BLOCKS is played as though Stepin Fetchit in his prime were somehow transported into the 21st century and given a role commensurate to his talents.
The Belgian as well as the Dutch actors all did a very good job, even though I never expected to see some of them in this kind of movie (for instance Kurt Rogiers an Peter Van den Begin).
Even though we do not really get involved with these characters, its hardly an annoyance, as the movie is pretty much focused on the action scenes.
Again, even though there is a lot more heavier stuff coming from Hollywood, for dutch standards, its pretty wild.
My personal choice though would have been to have Mickey Rourke as Carter.
This remake isn`t as bad as some people have made out though it`s not nearly as good as the original .
Good to see Michael Caine though.
You can prefer the old to the new though.
I thought the original was good though.
He did get a little emotional on the rooftop with Doreen though.
Even though it's not a loyal remake, it is a fun and hip remake.
Mos Def does an excellent job as well, his nasal voice he made for the film made it hard to understand him though, but he sure was lovable.
McKenna had the Oscar-nominated American History X under his belt at that point (though the Oscar-nom went to actor Edward Norton), but he followed up with the critically-panned Body Shots.
But for some reason she didn't catch on with the public though she does give a fine performance.
Lovello is phenomenally ambiguous and creepy, though somehow sympathetic as well - absolutely perfect for this role.
His female counterpart is his equal, though she presents herself much more subtly.
The young heroin never doubts him, though she really should.
You can see it's his work, though.
It's also nowhere near being Hitch's best silent film, even though it tends to be remembered over more polished works like The Ring and The Manxman.
Taken out of context though, it is a fairly decent late silent thriller, with only a few minor flaws in plot and direction.
It was one of his first films though so this can be forgiven.
The title sequence and Bobby McFerrinÂ´s rendition of Henry ManciniÂ´s classic theme is worth one star, though.  
The biggest problem with the film, though, would have to be the plot.
i had very low hopes for this eight and final installment in the original Pink Panther series of films.i just didn't believe Roberto Benigni would be a good fit.i'm happy to say i was wrong.Benigni was the best part of the film.he was brilliant,exceptionally funny.the man is a natural born comedian,with great comedic timing or at least it looks that way in this movie.beyond that,though,the slapstick sequences actually work much better here than in the previous movies.i laughed out loud a lot during this film.i don't agree at all with the the undeserved(in my opinion)current rating on this site of 3.5/10.for me,Son of the Pink Panther is an 8.5 1/0
the resemblance did not hurt his performance at all though.
The movie itself was good though.
I did find myself trying to add complexity and originality to the story as it went, though.
Even though I have always felt Martin and Lewis are worthy subjects of a theatrical biopic, I will take this over nothing.
It is hard to be sure if there is any point to all this, though the lack of a meaningful narrative suggests that the film is trying to convey some kind of subtextual meaning.
The biggest wastes are Coburn and Brando, the latter giving perhaps his laziest ever performance as the sex guru (though you can understand his agreeing to be in this.... a salary of $50,000 to rip off Aulin's clothes and romp around with her seems a pretty fair incentive!)
Regardless if one believes the "monster" is real or not, there is something in the air which makes one feel as though there are infinite possibilities no matter how much we think otherwise.
Nothing really does change in this film, though.
Even though this film is EXTREMELY different from the charming book by Dick King Smith, it manages not to insult it (Unlike films such as "One Hundred and One Dalmatians" and "The Jungle Book").
The emotion that appears later in the film is yet another good addition to this motion picture, though it may very much upset others.
Even though the lead character is a young kid, it was OK since all of the characters and story were realistic and serious - and not depicted from a kid's point of view.
About the pg13 though, F bomb was dropped once (twice if you count a replay of it saying) The musical score also did a nice touch to the scenes.
The direction of Kevin Dowling and the cinematography of Larry Reibman, though not outstanding, was above average.  
Good direction though, very good direction.
CAST: Even though Henry Wilcoxon plays the main role, he is not that good in this movie.
DIFFERENT DeMILLE: It is noticeable that THE CRUSADES, though an epic, concentrates more on message rather than lavish sets and costumes.
Surprisingly, this segment was directed by Ken Russell though it felt like something from Joe Dante or Paul Bartel (it was especially reminiscent of Irvin Kershner's "Hell Toupee" episode of "Amazing Stories").
I realized recently though that I really am wasting money buying movies unseen so I signed up with Netflix figuring that I could rent new releases that appealed to me & if I liked em' I would purchase em'.
difference that the violence is always off-stage - though only just, at times.
The plot involving the Thirties-era Shanghai Mafia is mostly presented through the boys' eyes, with the result that the most "action-oriented" events, usually occurring off-screen, seem incoherent and, though violent and tragic, beside the point.
Zhang Yimou is always about politics, even though the politics are sometimes "just" domestic politics, as in Raise the Red Lantern.
By now though, I have Lantern in such a high regard that it borders on gaining a mythical quality as I have yet to see it in it's entirety.
What really bothers me though, is that events take place that result in a complete shift in setting half way through the film, and that's always a dangerous move in the cinema.
This is not a remake of "The Gauntlet," though the theme is a familiar one.
The film is recommended for fans of Zhang Yimou or Gong Li, though without the vibrant cinematography the film wouldn't be ranked as his best by many people.
If you've already got the film on VHS, it's not worth "upgrading" to the DVD though.
In Haunted Spooks though we have a film that is ingenious, hilarious and inspired.
Best of all, even though were in 2006 I don't feel this film is out of date even though it's set in 1985.
They soon meet again, when Barrymore is making plans for her own wedding (to a total jerk), even though deep inside she feels that she's "settling" for security without true love.
The musical choices, though, were excellent.
I don't think I really need to tell you what comes next, but even though it's a predictable ride; trust me, it's a ride you want to be on.
This should go down in the same line as Family Guy and American Dad and while it will not win any Oscars (It has won awards though) it is a worth while show.
You know what they say though, don't judge a film by its summary.
I just can't take this, though.
The quality of animation in some bits is inspiring, and the breadth of what they are spoofing is amazing, you know your truly geek if you can figure out most of even the most esoteric (look up word if you don't know what it means, because it actually is ) references  Season 2   There are some gems in season two, however due to the fact that the DVD is uncensored, it makes it a bit more harsh, especially because most of the time we know what they're saying the overuse of the word douche seems to be without a doubt lack of a thesaurus in scripting, yes as immature as it can be, it's still kind of a funny word , but not used as a crutch the way most of the fart jokes come across, which there seem to be more in the second season than in the first, even though I don't think there really are in season two.
It has it's moments of stupidity, but it is well done, has a low-budget look to it, though it is a very expensive show, and will spoof off of many shows no one under...oh, about 25 will get.
I though the male lead Ben was great and nice looking in that down to earth boy next door way and not the I'm a male super model worship t my feet way, which is very unique for male role now days that have to be the knight and shinning armer type.
After those first 45 minutes, though, a strange subplot is put into action.
I liked this film a little better than some others on the board, though it does not have the suspense or urgency of a Hitchcock film.
William Girdler made his directorial debut in 1972 with the surprisingly decent exploitation flick Three on a Meathook, and since then basically everything he's directed has gone on to become notorious - though mostly that's because his films are so low quality, not because of any content.
Specter is doing more than just run the hospital though: He also likes to sacrifice his subjects to Satan.
):   The whole plot was way to contrived and there was nothing frightening about it, though it was slightly creepy(But still didn't manage to fascinate.)
Bruce Willis does what he does best; that is to say, he's annoying to the point where I was hoping someone would kill him and put us all out of our misery, even though I thoroughly enjoyed his character when he wasn't being mean to his wife.
After Jimmy's funeral it seems that Joyce never returns to the beauty shop that she owns and Cynthia and Cookie never work another day in their lives, even though all three women depend on the income from their jobs.
I would also like to complain about a movie that acts out a false story told by one of the characters as though the story were true.
How about that conclusion though?!
The characters are idealized and thin, though certainly not as much as they could have been, and the pacing and narration don't quite hang together.
For example, near the end Colbert marries George Reeves (yes, Superman) even though she admits she knows almost nothing about the man!!.
Uma desperately wants to have a man and goes home with one and is instantly crazy about him even though he treats her as what she was - a one night stand.
Even though I defended it, I still feel the screenplay left something to be desired.
Their chemistry was alive again in HB, though I would have liked more on-screen time for the two of them.
I've watched this film twice and even though the I knew what was going to happen, seeing it a second time was just as heart-wrenching and touching.
The bad: The writing is horrible even though I can safely say that the source material that provided it was fairly entertaining.
Joel Grey was a very good Chiun as well, though at the time I thought that they would never have him on the regular series, since it wasn't Broadway.
the dialogue is something else though.
The special effects earned it a rating of 5, though they were ruined in day light shots by cheap-looking filters reducing color saturation, common in B-series on TV ever since Saving Private Ryan set the standard for the phenomena of filter-credibility, to be abused ever since.
The story is quite straightforward, the ending is adept though not too surprising.
What really makes the episode stand out, though, is its sense of fun and prescience: ordinary people's reaction to the sight of Kirk and Spock is always a joy to behold, and it's pretty funny to hear our heroes mention man's first landing on the Moon as taking place on a Wednesday at the end of the '60s: they got it right, weekday and all, a full two years before the whole thing happened.
And though not terribly serious, Tomorrow is Yesterday is a good example.
The cinematography is effective, though the effects are some of the worst in the series, and many of the long range shots of the ship should probably have been cut.
Unfortunately, these mutants are generally feared by the rest of humanity, even though many of them mean no harm.
I think some people are losing it a little with their big wraps of "X-Men" though.
I've always been a fan of the X-Men, since the Animated Series aired (I'd never really read any of the comics though... ^_^).
The whole project seems a bit "safe," though, as if the producers wanted to make sure this big production didn't flop.
Even though "The Witnesses" deals with a very grim and serious subject, its primary focus always rests on the characters and the complex relationships that define them.
I can live with that though.
A love triangle and bisexuality are central to the 1994 Wild Reeds (Les roseaux sauvages), another period film, though it's set in the Sixties.
Even though I've seen many of Tex Avery's Warner Bros. cartoons and know what sorts of things to expect in them, "Dangerous Dan McFoo" was still a hoot.
However, there is one scene in this cartoon that I am surprised got past the censors: at one point when the opponent punches Dan, Dan puts his hand over his face, and it looks as though Dan is shooting his opponent the bird!
It was never really the story telling that made it classic even though it was good.
Obviously, Skynet's new gadgets have been introduced and they're rather interesting, though gaudy in some respects.
Thanks to his uncanny use with an assassin's gun(..there was a reason why he didn't have a gun on his person even though he is a skilled marksman), Smith evades his pursuers sending a great many villains to early graves(..or, as chief businessman Hammerson, played by a scarily skinny Stephen McHattie, would say, a "dirt nap").
My cousins and I almost didn't get to see it because the nim-witted box office staff decided ticket stubs would be needed to get into the theater even though we had Shoot 'Em Up passes directly from New Line Cinema reps. Because ticket stub holder got in first, we ended up sitting in the top seats of the theater, which turned out to be a blessing.
Even though the plot is a little thin, it's unique as well.
Don't worry, though -- a hail of gunfire follows very shortly thereafter.
That doesn't deter the film, though, because it's kind of like a stunt show, you're not really concerned with the story.
His character is the most complex in the film; and even though his actions are extreme, they are justified and Steiger manages to make the role believable; which is testament to his acting talent.
I'll find it eventually, though I'd like to avoid buy all three seasons separately to do it.
I found a few DVD's with some of the episodes (not this one though) and although they are kind of "hokey" by todays standards they are still entertaining.
all i gotta say for this movie is that it blows, pointless story line,crappy cast, no laughs, waste of my time and the TV stations, the best part of this movie was the mud wrestling all though it lasted some 5 seconds i love meghan in this movie and i think she was the only bright spot but ya this movie blows i give it a third of a star(only cuz they mud wrestled) out of 5, plz don't watch this movie even if it is the only thing on TV i personally would go to sleep but eh its the best option considering this movie will put u to sleep wut a waste to the national lampoon series damn id rather watch van wilder again at least it had some laughs, o well this is wut the movie world has come to
You get a first hand account of slave life, it will not be pretty at all though there were some times of joy in their lives.
Unfortunately though there are many people out there who fit that category.
Seriously though would anyone watch a special on the Holocaust and expect the words of survivors to suggest that their experiences in death camps to have been a treat and that the Nazis weren't all that bad?
The actors, though most of them well known from other British films and TV series always believable through very natural and modest acting.
The performances are brave and heartfelt in all cases, and even though the drama takes place over one weekend, the characters really do evolve.
This is added to by the hand-held camera work and the slightly grainy quality of the image, which is as though a much larger picture has been magnified to concentrate on these people.
The entire series consists of about 175 episodes, of which I'd say at least 125 are filler or some sort of subplot (I didn't bother to count and I wouldn't be surprised if that number were in fact higher, though).
Some of these filler episodes are actually quite enjoyable, though many are quite silly or dull.
One thing I do think though is that it dragged on too long, a lot of things did.
There are a lot of filler episodes that make you feel as though you've wasted half an hour.
The plot with Naraku is interesting, though I found it a bit convoluted at first.
I also zoned out during the drawn-out battle with the Schwarzenator near the end, because I really didn't care about John Connor (or his cute, perky wife, though she was never in danger the entire movie - another dramatic mistake).
2) For some reason, John Connor was (a) unable to trust a terminator even though he found out in part 2 that they can be trusted if programmed correctly and (b) totally stunned to find out that a terminator had flesh and blood and organs, even though that's the first type he ever encountered.
SOme of the parts are suspenseful though.
If you have kids then you will most likely cry at the mere though of your children going missing.
Even though I did not understand the language and the subtitles were in French (which, since I am not very proficient in French, I had trouble reading sufficiently fast), I did appreciate the emotions conveyed by the protagonists.
Having said this, I honestly felt at though this movie did a fantastic job of translating the visions of the future that were set up in the original Terminator and T2 and fleshing out a feature-length film of them.
Leaving the theater, I honestly felt as though this one gave the first two a run for their money as a film, as much as it pained me to say it.
The newsreel footage and swing music were delightful between the acts, though.
The movie does deliver on all usual fun stuff that "Dallas" fans look for (J.R.'s connivin' and dealin' and all that), though it's a bit painful to see our beloved stars aging.
One thing I DID like though was the updated opening titles.
Delpy's wonderful touch with these delicate moments makes the movie a winner, even though the ending feels like it could have gone either way and probably came off the editing room floor.
It is hard, though, for a non-French person to judge just how much of all this is meant to portray the character of "the French" (if anything like that exists) and how much is mere parody exploiting and playing with the clichÃ© that French people always think about love and sex.
This unmarried couple discovered that, though they profess loving one another and enjoying lots of sex and love making, they actually did not know one another.
She had aspirations to be a photographer, though (for reasons the film will make clear) her work is strictly third-class.
Neil manages to ooze sex and allure even though he is just trying to ease the pain of his past by embracing it and letting it control who he is.
Seeing that there is pervasive sexual exposure between adults, as well as between adults and kids (though discreetly handled), this film will repulse many viewers.
Araki exquisitely handles the ending (not divulged here) with the appropriate effusion of tendered emotion by the two main actors (warning: though the film's trailer subtlety gives away the finish).
I enjoyed all the performances and believed the characters, even though I had seen all the actors before on TV.
It's unusual enough to add to the uniqueness of this film - it really is ground-breaking - and Robin Guthrie's music/The Cocteau Twins haven't been used before in movies (though you may have recognised Liz Fraser's vocals in the last Lord of the Rings soundtrack).
Brian blanked out the episodes because he couldn't face the truth, and Neil can't face it either, though he thinks he can.
The movie though was mediocre but watchable.
Her performance was as wooden then as in this though she made a couple of good films later.
Troma bought the rights to it though they did not produce it.
Even though I wouldn't consider it a serious horror movie, I think it does a lot of things better than the so called serious horror movies.
Good film, really enjoyed when I watch the DVD over the weekend though one thing did spoil it, vampires walking in the daylight!
The end comes from left field too and I really, really enjoyed the simpleness and cleverness of it, though nobody will ever figure out who the killer is until he is revealed.
He ruins what could have been a decent relationship with his boss(played by Anne Marie Johnson) to be a pig and is constantly running back to that gold-digging self-centered trollop Monica, even though her love for him was only on a financial level.
The acting is atrocious; the music is lousy even though it is Grieg.
Nice cinematography/landscapes though ...
Grieg's music was nice to listen to, though as in all films about composers, they only give samplings.
One caution though - see the film on a full stomach cause it will make you hungry.
There was one thing I did like, though, the episodes with people in historical costumes and the guards on the St. Isaac's observation deck.
maybe it is because this meeting even though it is for some hours is more important than the rest of the every days.
The scenery is perfect, as the three of them visit the very tourist places of SaintPete, though without paying much attention to monuments and cathedrals, just enjoying life and fooling around.
Maybe a bit sour at the end - well, Uchitel and Dunya Smirnova, the scriptwriter, had to invent something to end the trip somewhere (no one dies though, so life goes on and there is no need to shed a tear) - the movie is just a perfect example of what Russian traditionally low budget mainstream cinema (as compared to US standards) can do without advertising-like special effects, mafia shootings, and superheroes.
The Stroll has simple plot though it is interesting and the details that frill it are very deep.
In the end, though, she ends up becoming a writer, and what will torment her is the choice she will have to make.
Somehow, she turns that into a positive experience - though when you see the beginning scenes of her life there, you won't imagine she ever could.
The NFB's Focus on Animation site though reclaims and highlights historically vital works such as Le Paysagiste, making it a great resource for animation lovers.
I feel reluctant making this comparison though, in a way, because it is evident that this piece of animation must have taken thousands of hours to produce.
An early Mike Myers film, but I think better than the far more successful Austin Powers series, though not as good as Waynes World.
Some of the better comedic moments, though, come from the cameos, especially by Steven Wright and Charles Grodin, who is always wonderful, whatever film he is in, although the poetry scenes are quite funny too.
I haven't seen it in at least 15 years though.
The minor but ever interesting Russell Rouse wrote and, in his first go, directed The Well (though he shares that credit with producer Leo Popkin).
Still though, "Twitch of the Death Nerve" is a must see!
Even though it was duplicated in several other films (both "Dawn of the Dead" and "Friday the 13th Part 2"), never was it so gut wrenchingly realized.
Overall though, I don't care about any of that.
Definitely not for the squeamish though!
It's influence is obvious in these new films, and Bava's film, though older, is just as strong, if not more so than it's numerous followers.
The Kevin Smith influence is obvious, though the film pulls it off well.
The best part of this movie is that even though they had all the eye candy that every independent film should have, they had a good moral to the story.
I love the scenery and even though it was not filmed in the USA it could have been.
Their adventures are generally predictable, though always believable and in-character.
Hard to believe that Garbo and Crawford were born just months apart--they were both 26 during filming, but Garbo's world-weary ballerina looks and behaves as though she were 36.
Wallace Beery gives a decent comic-villain performance complete with off-and-on German accent, though I had trouble caring about his character's money problems.
Although I think it will most appeal to film buffs, there is no denying the thing has power, even though that power has become somewhat obscured by the passing years.
And even though her beauty is far from conventional, it is truly undeniable.
Neither ended up in the MGM production, though both had distinguished film careers later on.
We are used to seeing this now; (think Altman, in particular) where characters are all somehow connected, even though they may not even know each other.
The acting is incredible, though Garbo's REALLY over-the-top performance was a bit much.
The movies have begun "talking" not long before this film was made and the stars of those silents were still doing their acting in front of the camera as though no one was going to hear them talk.
But there were a number of inconsistencies, that could have easily been cleared up without adding any extra time to the film; though at one hour and twenty minutes another 15 or 20 minutes to give us some backstory certainly wouldn't have made this film overly long.
The idea of a multi-level story peopled by an all star cast was brand new with this feature which deservedly won an Oscar for Best Picture though it received no other nominations.
The plot moves along in a nice pace thanks to Goulding's direction; never does it linger on too much on one specific character, though at least for me, anytime Garbo was on screen the story came to a crashing halt.
He teams up with Crawford, enjoys a dance with her and falls for her even though she's much too young.
The car crashes are fun to watch for 8-year olds, though.
The best part though is your wonder and amazement through the adventure.
Even though I liked this last entry (yeah, right) in the Friday the 13th series, a part of me can understand why others don't care for it.
The best thing I can say about Seven Mummies is that it's watchable if you've got nothing better to do & it's reasonably well made, other than that though I'm finding it very difficult to say anything positive about it.
Note: Let's be fair though, none of us could have helped wanting to see Freddy Vs. Jason.
There is some Freudian perspective to be had from the Jason hosts' retractable black tongue, though this is surely unintentional.
He seemed inexplicably convinced that the wheel of the "Friday" series needed to be drastically reinvented, even though fans had lined up for basically the same plot eight times prior.
Very good overall, but Snake and Crane Arts of Shaolin is better (even though it has an awkward title) if you're looking for something from this era.
One thing though, once on board the Merchantman, didn't it seem like there was a whole lot more of them than could have arrived in the first place?
This is a rare treat (even though we only see browns, reds and blues and even though the water is sometimes red, sometimes blue) and along with the original score re-recorded and 19 minutes of outtakes following the 90 minute feature, it is somewhat of an event.
Too bad about the bleached skulls, though...
All this having been said, it was astonishing to me that this film tells us almost nothing about Holmes' professional life, even though he spent over 30 years as a Supreme Court Associate Justice.
The intent, though, is to show such a relationship and show how it develops, where it can go, and how it could happen.
;)   I find it interesting though that the actress playing Y is listed by IMDB as being born in 1984.
Even though, certain parts in ''Untamed'' were silly & offbeat......
Even though I hung my head down in shame in some parts that could have been gold, I give the filmmakers respect for some of the visuals in this movie.
Filmmakers who don't grasp whereof he spoke make movies like DEAD HEIST- movies that usually boast some impressive, though often no-budget fx (or even- as in this case- some great zombie "crowd" scenes), but very little in the way of character or story upon which to, say, hang a review.
The gore is nothing new, though the fact that the dead can only be killed by being shot in the heart (and you're to blame...) is a poor attempt at trying something different.
The plot jumped around non-stop, and it was practically impossible to follow, even though it was incredibly simplistic.
He appears as though he had more to offer.
I mention this only because it seems as though this movie made it here on star power alone.
though two french stars(reno binoche) are trying to make their character genuine, their presence don't make a good story, you even wonder what sergi Lopez cameo's appearance is doing in this story?jean reno as a international business man is not very convincing and Juliette binoche plays as in a loreal commercial endorsement, after 20 minutes the intrigue is gone, and everything is just not believable if you like the plot you'd rather watch Philippe Lioret very good "airport" movie "TombÃ©s du ciel" with jean rochefort
Even though Binoche is supposed to be his polar opposite in the film, she, too, is pretty off-beat but likable.
A special call-out, though, has to go to Binoche, who just couldn't be any more delightful.
I have alway envisioned Snapphanar as the ultimate freedom-fighters even though I'm a Swede to the death.
Not in this case though i'm afraid.
No matter though since this was definitely a case of very little bang for your buck.
The historical angle (even though a bit resculpted) works fine, but the dialog is absolutely horrible.
The camera work are very good, the mis-en-scene works fine as well even though the budget was low.
The music tends to be a bit repetitive though.
A number of things quickly drew me in, even though they do not directly have an impact on the quality of Route 666.
Even though this isn't Wesley's masterpiece, he shows that he has one in him.
Even though it's quite old, it remains funny all the same.
Yes, the B-movie production level is at times risible, and the ending is very odd Â read IMDb's trivia section for an explanation (though avoid it if you haven't seen the film, as the one piece of trivia is an enormous spoiler) Â but otherwise it's a fine movie.
Though Alexander Golitzen's set design per se is impressive, the low-budget afforded the film is most evident during the very mild destruction of the underground city at the climax; the downbeat coda Â in which the heroine is stupidly killed Â was perhaps unwarranted, though.
A handful of archaeologists, led by John Agar, are digging up and decoding plaques with "cuneiform" writing on them, though what we see bears no resemblance to any cuneiform that a Sumerian might have seen.
It is an extremely moving film, though it may be one of the most difficult movies I ever sat through, both the beauty and brutality are overwhelmingly relentless.
Ironically he has to even sell the pelts to raise funds even though this is an illegal act.
Their struggle to save the antelope vividly recalls scenes of how the buffalo was decimated in "Dances With Wolves", though we get no inkling of the role of the antelopes in Tibetan culture, so saving them just seems either altruism about a rare animal, nationalism, obsession, stubbornness or macho independence.
The subtitles were only hard to read as white on white a few times, though a couple of times they lingered on the screen too long past a dialog, blocking views.
National Geographic co-produced the film and has additional information about the film and the cause at their Web site (though for some reason IMDb doesn't consider their's the official movie site).
I tried to watch this piece of trash late one night, and even though I have a profound phobia about alien abduction (no, I'm not lying) I didn't think this was scary and I didn't think it was suspenseful.
Ultimately, though, it's a good portrait of a strange cerebral experience and how it gets interpreted.
It's fun, though, noticing little details that he left out of the movie.
True story though it may be, it is clearly too personal for Striber to manipulate (even just a little bit) to make it the right shape and form for a movie.
Walken is portraying somebody who went though what must've been the most traumatic experience that a person could have.
It's as though he personally finds the story insanely funny (and for many, Streiber's visitors in the night schtick is a joke), and he seems to be winking at the audience and barely restraining himself from rolling his eyes.
She is totally believable even though we never even see her take an acting class, much less see her waiting tables to help herself.
The X-Files, though a good show, never quite reaches the level of freakiness that "Communion" has in moments like those in which Walken confronts the aliens.
Walken's character, though often bizarre beyond the point of full understanding, is outstandingly well acted.
Oddly, the trial drags on for many days even though there are no witnesses.
Flip Dog is pretty cool though.
In Whiteboys Flip is searching though differt racial personalities and finding who he is.I give this movie two big thumbs up, it has become one of my favorite movies.
In Whiteboys Flip is searching though differt racial personalities and finding who he is.I give this movie two big thumbs up, it has become one of my favorite movies.
There were some minor flaws to this epic show cast though, with the most obscene one being the fact that the character introductions are pretty much absent, seeing as everybody seemingly just pops up and goes away after a few scenes, to return later again.
All of this could be forgiven though, if the acting was any good.
It looks as though it was filmed on a Viewmaster.
Its a little bloody, not gory enough for my taste though.
There's this odd sub-plot about some guy who has to copy a disk for some reason but we never find out why even though he knocks the cleaner out so he isn't seen & it seems to be quite important to him, the disk or it's contents are never followed up or even mentioned again.
He can't quite match the charm and manners of Ugo Tognazzi, though.
Even though in its production values its age is showing, this version of Jane Eyre is impressive and well deserving of a new generation of viewers in its new format.
Sorcha Cusack conveys Jane's determination and intelligence very well, even though she looks too old for the part, and Michael Jayston is the best Rochester ever.
Rochester is most aptly portrayed herein, even though I love Ciaran Hinds!
By that time though, Sally Morton (Barbara Stanwyck) had already been the 'other woman' to the first Mrs.C., who we only know by the 'Angel of Death' painting.
It was somewhat irritating though to see how compliant she was with every single idea her father advanced, especially going away to school.
At first it almost seems as though the film follows a non-linear narrative; we find out later that this is not the case.
We don't really see them though until the final twenty minutes of the film, and Bogart doesn't really get a chance to act until that point either.
Now, even though these are legitimate researchers, Green Peace has an agenda and they want complete protection of the environment.
It has a lot of flaws, though.
He seemed too forced and didn't look as though he were enjoying himself playing Grover Cleaver.
Still I like Norm MacDonald and he does his best, though he doesn't have much to work with.
Richard, "I'm gonna give them a super-duper f*cking dose man, I'm gonna send them to space man, but this spaceship ain't f*cking coming back though baby".
The unsuccessful seizure results in severe bleeding, a misinterpreted reimbursement note, and a crime site appearing as though a brutal murder has taken place.
Though not Laura any longer, the blue eyes are still beautiful and vibrant, her smile is still lovely, and though illness has taken its toll, she is still beautiful.
Ray Milland is fine as the devastated father though his bad hairpiece is distracting.
And the acting is also well, not great but OK.  One point I will get across though.
The supernatural phenomenon seems to have passed her by even though she's Mexican.
It was as though the epitome of that which he lacked confidence around was the very person to destroy those shades.
Even though there is still a lot of racism out there, they showed most white people as racists whom are helpless without an illegal immigrant doing cheap labor.
There are a few good lines and situations though, like the wife of a state Senator that says "Why does everyone think that a rich white man that votes against a minority is a racist?".
I lived in California for 23 years and having Mexican people around is a way of life, they're just other people, they have lives and feelings and YES they do a hell of a lot of the work, so I get the idea behind this film, very well, even though that a lot of the work that is portrayed is work that no one else will do.
it's quiet, it's intense, and surprises even the most seasoned horror fan, though i wouldn't categorize this as such.
3 out of 10, though.
Khan Crittenen, who was superb in Clubland, was as dull as dishwater (though I concede that it was more the script at fault than his actual performance).
Better to wait till its DVD launch - it will lose nothing on the small screen, though it would be better to lose the show entirely.
That said, the movie is interesting as a fantasy in its own train wreck sense - the characters spiral into darkness and despair, get murdered, suicide or end up in jail - though is this all the West can lead to?
Dan Aykroyd and Jane Curtin return to their roles as Beldar and Prymatt, though perhaps passing the torch on to different comic actors might have been wise (neither star looks very enthused about re-boarding this vehicle).
The role of Connie has been inherited by Michelle Burke for some reason, though Lorraine Newman can be spotted in a cameo near the end of the film.
Granted though, it does have one of the better murder-during-sex scenes of the slasher genre.
Probably trying to cash-in on other power-tool related horror-films like Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE and TOOLBOX MURDERS...THE NAILGUN MASSACRE is a dull and unoriginal film that has a few laugh-worthy moments that don't make it a complete and utter waste of time - though it's close...  A chick is gang-raped by a bunch of construction workers.
It does have it's good moments though.
People literally die even though they've only had nails fired into their arms or legs.
It was originally written by a French playwriter way back in the late 1960's..............no mention of him at all,........ even though the American version(Birdcage) and the Italo-French version are identical even in the dialogue !
In fact, Harich, after his release from prison in 1964, went on to publish and teach in the DDR: he continued to argue for German re-unification under socialist auspices and for greater attention to environmental concerns under socialism; he traveled to the West and always returned to the DDR (though opportunities to 'defect' were not lacking), and, after the collapse of the DDR, refused to testify against those who had imprisoned him in 1956.
I think it fair to say that someone who objected to many aspects of the DDR regime but still wished to hold on to his influence with the leaders would necessarily walk a dangerous tightrope; and it is no easy matter to judge whether Brecht would have served the cause of humane socialism better had he spoken out more forcefully against Ulbrecht's regime (though, obviously, that would make for better cinema).
"Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey," though only containing 30-or-so minutes of the original "Game of Death" is (the real) Bruce Lee's last film.
It is so well done I was glued to the set even though all they show are clips and the remaining scenes to Lee's last movie: "Game of Death."
I have seen both sound and silent versions of this movie and I actually prefer the silent one--even though it was based on a musical!
and sure it's personal, though i got turned off a bit by the whole techno approach.. One of the best scenes in a film I've seen in the last years is Jason Issacs doing his "I got you under my skin".
Even though this movie centered around London's Underground, I felt like this could've been any city...reminding me of it's inhabitants running about half-asleep, forgetting (ignorance is bliss) about existence and valuing life.
And, oddly enough, both are 17 minutes long (though the speed at which the films are cranked may make this slightly longer or shorter).
This really isn't too surprising, though, as when the film was made back in 1911, outright plagiarism was common and pretty much condoned and many times the same production company would remake their films only a year or so later!
Though it is often celebrated for its pioneering use of editing and suspense, this 17-minute Biograph is not all that different in style from Edwin S. Porter's 'The Great Train Robbery (1903),' which I can certainly remember being even more exciting than this, though perhaps hindsight has clouded my memory.
Clocks, Mad Magazine like, are relentlessly ticking away in the background reminding us that time has not stood stillÂthough you'll believe it has, it must have!
I immediately liked it even though it was a bit bleak.
Looking back at this film feels like looking back towards the end of a very long tunnel - even though it was made as late as '92.
This movie is really cool even though there are to much early 90's reminders in it.
The film was based on the memoirs of convicted French felon Henri CharriÃ¨re (though several critics have expressed doubt over the factual accuracy of the described events), who spent many years incarcerated in the brutal penal settlement of mainland French Guiana.
McQueen though he's far from French has the rebel persona that really fits this part.
It seems as though the screenwriters didn't read the novel, but had instead heard a few things about it, and then went on to write the screenplay.
The casting I must say is a total flop though.
The music, though, by Jerry Goldsmith and the cinematography by Fred J.Koenekamp are both excellent.
Well worth the watch though.
The pic is overlong about two hours and half , though is neither boring, nor tiring, but entertaining, because develops many adventures and happenings.
The support cast though very secondary is very fine : George Coulouris,Don Gordon,Gregory Sierra,Victor Jory, among others.
Despite all these privations, he never loses his resolve to escape, though Hoffman eventually does and accepts his life on the island after one failed escape attempt.
In the end, Charriere does escape, though in real-life, this apparently did NOT occur.
As for length issues, the native villager sequence runs too long (though the nudity will no doubt entertain some), and trimming of some earlier scenes may have helped.
Well even though some of these sorority girls *are* big snobs, more concerned with how much money a girl's family has than her character - our Alice still HOPES she will be invited to join one of these sororities.
Even though I thought some of it was kind of exaggerated (sp?)
The meat guy was pretty funny though.
I enjoyed the film, though it was tedious in a couple of places, but the attention to historic detail and accuracy is what encapsulated me...I'm a historian after all...and this was something welcome in a low-budget, B-grade comedy.
Even though this show probably wont come back i enjoyed it while it lasted and think that it had a lot of potential.
Edit: I do love how the genre section somehow includes "horror" though
I won't ruin it though.
The staring faces are brushes Amelio paints with, and at the end, on a boat heading for Italy at last -- though Spiro thinks they're heading for America -- the director gives us an awesome series of faces that are worthy of Paul Strand or the best of the FSA photographers of the Dust Bowl of the Thirties: faces that speak volumes.
even though the film focuses more on the italian businessman, the struggle for survival that most Albanians had to go and still have to is quite clear.
And so I have given it four stars - not because it's good though, because it's entertaining.
It seems as though pride and responsibility have left director Ross McElwee long before his journey to find Sherman.
Referring to it as a blog isn't originally my idea, though, as roberttroll previously reviewed this film and his observation seemed right on the mark.
In particular, Pat seemed rather flaky though pretty and Ross came off with a personality that was akin to balsa wood.
McElwee manages to evoke an entire persona for himself - whether authentic or not - with scenes like these, at the same time drawing an insightful - if slightly overblown, though satirically so - comparison of himself to William Tecumseh Sherman and his devastating Civil War march through the South.
Meanwhile, Frank, though only 11, has begun to drink beer and whiskey, and both kids swear and use foul language in front of both their parents.
I was laughing at Bernie and Linda, mostly Bernie, though Linda has many moments too.
Walt stops listening to his father, though Bernie has collapsed in the street from something and has had to be taken to a hospital by ambulance.
When husband and wife decide to split, the only ones who get hurt are the children, and even though Joan and Bernard Berkman are in the center of their nasty divorce, their two sons -- Frank and Walt -- are the ones going through the trauma.
Every member of the family is brilliantly brought to life and even though they are acting in their own flawed, selfish, self-annihilating and myopic ways, they still endear themselves to the audience like they are our own family.
"The Squid and the Whale" is a sad--though at times very funny--look at what divorce does to one family in 1986 New York.
Even though I am a werewolf horror genre fan, I thought this was terrible.
It doesn't really make up for anything though.
The isn't exactly for children either even though it looks like it.
Always a pleasure to watch Facinelly, though, although he could choose better films to participate in.
Unless you are a really die hard fan of the original and feel it is your duty to sit though this, then I recommend you choose something else to watch as this will be a waste of your time.
It has many faults - Christian Slater just ain't up to the job any more (but seems to be enjoying himself), a long and overly-talky middle act, some extremely ropey visual effects (though it has to be said that there are many good ones despite the obviously low budget), a blatant re-use of a scene from the original Hollow Man not-very-well-disguised, and a conclusion that felt very rushed - dare I suggest the budget ran out?
The film is dedicated to the lives lost at Columbine even though we barely spend any time thinking about it and we don't even seem to care about Lauren until the film is more than half over.
I'm also a secondary ed teacher, have had two brain surgeries (for Chiari Malformation not an AVM though), followed by re-hospitalization for severe infection, and had extensive rehabilitation to learn to speak and walk again.
and says the "F" word (unfortunately cut out of the DVD version though it's obvious when she says it).
I wouldn't let the kids see it though.
Although far too soft in its final scenes, this debut movie for director Herbert Ross changes speeds enough to keep things bubbling, even though his bumpy rhythm may put some viewers off.
Even though a few set changes and a couple of new supporting characters are added to "open up" the storyline, director Herbert Ross and writer Buck Henry manage to keep the same spirit of the original one-act, two-character play intact.
The title implies that this will be a 'confessional' drama and implies that the central character is a prostitute, though that is somewhat misleading.
Even though she knows little about him, Anna follows him to Milan.
Even though he's straight, I think he has a wandering eye for my beautiful friend, who is also a trainer!
The ending veers sharply away from comedy into deep melodramatic territory, and even though it is diffused quite handily, the film almost drowns in TV-movie-of-the-week sap before the mood lightens again.
Well the film is a murder mystery and actually looks like an Indian film though it's a Hollywood film  It has Indian actors like Naseeruddin Shah, Amjad Khan, Dalip Tahil, Ratna Patak Shah  The film is a thriller and how a cop goes an investigates it  It touches on lots of topics on the problems cops face in India while solving cases albeit in a light manner  The film is serious and lighthearted at the right places and there is a nice balance  Direction is good Naseer essays his part with brilliance like always, One of India's finest actors Ratna Patak suits her role as his wife(in real life too she is his wife) Amjad Khan looks overweight and he is okay Dalip too is okay
Cool title though.
(the title being how the Spanish refer to the Tiger Shark species) screams 1970s Â including an agreeable recurring song but especially the disco-driven, drug-fuelled boat parties; frustratingly, though, the full-length print I viewed kept not only alternating between English and Spanish dialogue but had English subtitles popping up for the latter and vice-versa!
Have just seen the last episode, No 32, (though the site says only 30 episodes were made) and I must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crime/cop stories.
The movie is powerful, though it is questionable that it only won Best Cinematography at the Academy Awards.
But I was a little disappointed that none of them really got what they deserved (even though in real life it took 40 years to get justice) and got let-off with minor sentences, none of them over 10 years for the brutal killing of three people and all the mass-destruction and arson they did.
But for all that this film is worth a look because even though it is very uneven the main theme of apartheid, oppression & racism between black & white Americans is a good lesson for us all to think about and realise that over the last 30 years nothing much has changed.
This film is a good,though not flawless representative of the turbulent 1960's south.The character representation is good,though taken to a bit of an extreme in places.Gene Hackman gives another knockout performance here,as he does always as does Willem Dafoe.The cast is great,though Gailard Sartain was a surprising choice as Sheriff Stuckey, given his penchant for appearing in the worst of films.It is based on a true story,and as we all know,true stories are never presented to perfection.It is,however,presented as well as it can be.This is a very gripping,edge of your seat film,and very well done.
It's not just the actors, but Gene and William's characters, I wanted to be just like them, they were able to stand up even though the many times of being knocked down and caring so much just to try to in some way save that town.
During the murder scenes you feel as though you are right there experiencing it with the Montgomerys.
The way they can nonchalantly describe to each other the way a woman is chewing up ground glass or how it's so difficult to saw through a spine, as though they're doing nothing more than talking about the weather, is what makes this film so absolutely chilling.
Wow, she's a regular freak, though, isn't she?
I hated the drug use scenes though because they were a bit too graphic.
When i watched the film MY EYES were Hooked From Start to End  You Will Find it Very Brilliantly Directed Even though I'm writing about this 2 years later but it is Definitely Worth Buying  Go and Grab a Copy of the DVD out on EROS
I thought it had justified ending though I can understand why some people might get frustrated with it .
Even though Chris Robinson's story (if it could even be called that) might have some entertaining parts, the movie ends up making you want to get up and leave your nice Lay-z-boy recliner.
But the movie insists that the white one is actually an albino negro, even though Sunshine, who is played by the amazing Chris Robinson, is so obviously a white man.
The movie had an intelligent story, and though it's called Spectres, it was more about a mother struggling to make life with her teen daughter as close to normal as possible after a suicide attempt.
It's always a pleasure to see Marina in anything, Spectres is fabulous though, a perfect project for Marina, and she gets nothing but praise from me for her performance.
But it seems to be just a flash of light, even though the makers insist there was nothing that could produce that light!
She does give a realistic portrayal, though.
**SPOILERS** Even though the advertising for the movie "Spectres" makes it look like a ghost story it's a lot deeper and philosophical then you would have first expected it to be.
They REALLY under rated it though.
For that matter, though, even Levy is a bit underused.
Geraldine, though no longer with us, probably got a crown in heaven for her role in this forgotten thriller.
You can be assured though, that you will not get the shock of your life, or that you will spend a sleepless night out of fright.
The Grand Guignol/Grande Dame sub-genre of suspense in its decadent phase (though that might sound redundant).
Ruth though, is in cahoots with her nephew, the dude that played a doctor on Emergency eons ago.
The end, though, throws more questions than the film answers.
You can't compare the twist to The Sixth Sense or Fight Club, or The Crying Game, and so on, because those twists made you simply look at events in a different light; they did not change what had actually occurred (though I guess Fight Club did change events to an extent).
It will certainly be great for discussion, heated or not, and that's a sign (for me) of a good experience, though not necessarily a superior movie.
Ozon has made it so much more though.
"Swimming Pool," though billed as an erotic thriller, is really about the creative process (I think), and I won't say anymore about that because to do so will give away the ending.
I think it was while watching "Dark Command," the John Wayne movie (though Claire Trevor gets first billing, for some reason), that I first realized Roy Rogers was really an excellent actor.
Even though certainly wasn't the world's best horror director (he's often even referred to as the Italian Ed Wood), but his movies never failed to entertain me, and you could always tell he had great intentions.
Quite a few people die, though usually off-camera and unrealistically, and "Orville Ketchum" lives up to his reputation as one of the funnier and more-difficult-to-kill B-movie actors.
Instead of hooking someone up on a wire and swinging them around, they added some effect afterwards to blur out the image and make it appear as though he is moving extremely fast.
Bottom Line: Pretty tame blaxploitation vampire flick with some fun to be had though.
In some sense, Vegas Vampires seemed to be an effort, though largely deficient, to remember the days of the blaxploitation films in which Roundtree and Williamson starred in the 1970s.
the soundtrack has very little to do with the ebb and flow of the film, the directing and editing are amateurish, but not horrible, the acting is over-the-top in almost every instance (though roy morton has a good performance as a super-sleazy sex-driven criminal) and the color is garish.
Even though it tells the story of the Pakistani Muslim family in England, it deals with major issues that all desis can relate to.
The story is trite, and the attempt to project Indians into a movie though admirable should have been done with some skill and tact.
The cast, though new, do an excellent job carrying out their roles.
Undercover agent Gabrielle has also been sent in, though against his wishes Hawke has fallen for her.
That photo is a publicity still from 'He Did and He Didn't', though it doesn't actually correspond to any scene in the film as it now exists.
The perfect son, Shakespeare, looks after his little siblings though it could cost him his life.
Marilyn Monroe-watchers will be disappointed by MM's lack of sparkle here; she certainly looks lovely but seemingly has no connection to this part, and no chemistry whatsoever with mannered Olivier as the starched, though not entirely humorless, royal.
The cry is "Vivat - Vivat - Vivat" followed ,though not in the film, by "Rex",=King] or "Regina",= Queen, as appropriate; meaning "The King ,or Queen,Lives!"
And I may add Â though I am aware that this is a matter of taste entirely Â that Marilyn was never sexier than when she played Elsie Marina.
Marilyn Monroe sparkles, though her role doesn't challenge her in the same way as did her parts in "Some Like It Hot" and "The Misfits" Â those parts really brought out her enormous artistic versatility, as did the 1952 picture "Don't Bother to Knock."
It is interesting that a number of films set during the 1900s and early 1910s, both comedies such as 'The Assassination Bureau' and serious dramas such as 'The Riddle of the Sands' and the Robert Powell version of 'The 39 Steps', focus on diplomatic attempts to prevent the outbreak of a European war, even though we know that in real life such attempts were to end in failure.
even though lame-os will whine about the name not making any sense, that's part of why it's so awesome.
This movie did not do that though.
Even though it was the Aztecs who were the strongest in the time portrayed by the film, "they 'the Mayas' were close allies of the Aztecs, they shared ideas and religion; and there were trade routes throughout Mesoamerica.'
After the eclipse, however, the movie settles into a conventional "chase" mode which, though interesting, can't compare to the first 95 minutes.
Though not a fan of "The Passion of the Christ" and though feeling that "Braveheart" was overrated, it's thumbs up for Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto."
And though some have complained that the film's ending involves an historical inaccuracy, I think there was more than enough reason to put it in.
LIVING DOLL is not a very graphic film, though there are a few gore scenes, and the decaying corpse make-up FX are top-notch.
Be warned though: it tends to bore.
In prison we see that he doesn't regret what he's done though he may regret the absurd world he lives in.
The locations are chosen well, though it's often hard to remember that Visconti was trying to stick to the period of the novel (1930s Algiers).
Clarkson plays the housewife who still has a job even though she could easily live off of her husband's wealth, and she's not as clueless as many other movie housewives are.
Campbell Scott, though, is the real joy of "The Dying Gaul."
The film also leaves a few questions open-ended even though doing so serves no purpose.
Elaine definitely gets to understand Robert's pain, though she is resistant to feeling it because of her own situation.
Robert comes to gain a clear understanding of Elaine's heartache, though again he has his own reasons for not letting himself be moved by it.
I really liked Grendel's mother, I must admit, even though creative license took her far beyond the original character in the poem.
The cartoon version of Angelina Jolie arouses just as well, if not better, than the real thing (I could have lived without the high heels though).
I'm glad I rented it though.
It was sad though.
I do think some of the problems were a bit cheesy and too classic (the woman being pregnant and happening to have her baby on that occasion)Overall though it was good.
Nick is a store security guard who sees Emily stealing and lets her get away with it because he's inexplicably captivated by her, even though he's actually prettier than she is.
The film has a bright look and a pleasing sense of watching a smooth, gentlemanly crook at work, though there is never any sense of danger, and comparisons with Tarantino seem very wide of the mark.
I wouldn't agree--it's not at all funny, though it has some ironic twists (that you're bound to like) and has a somewhat light mood at times.
It didn't to become boredom though.
Getting sent to prison for having a second baby even though the first one died?
Still a great film though!
Fortress was his first entry to non-horror oriented field, even though Fortress still has many horror elements, too.
These issues are over population and alarming/scary development of technology, and even though the film is not too deep or philosophical, it has these aspects of commentary about society and our everyday world, and what it should not be.
I remember seeing Fortress and Fortress 2: Re-Entry for a bargain of Â£1,00 each so I though okay.
The acting is very good, even though I haven't heard of them apart from Lambert.
I have earlier seen Modern Times (which actually god dialog and singing in it) and City Lights (which had melodies in it), both were great (I need to rewatch City Lights though.
The story really begins, though, when the thief disguises himself as a prince, and attempts to woo the princess.
He does successfully, though he is filled with guilt about deceiving her.
Unfortunately for this film, though, the remake starring Sabu was an even better film and was overshadowed a bit because of this.
There is a little more to the acting though, for example Asian actress Anna May Wong in the role of the Princess' traitorous slave girl.
(though obviously all fake.)
Interesting, though, was the relationship between the youngest character, Brita, and Ms. Fletcher.
It is nice seeing Lucy work with her kids though.
I can't really compare this show though to "The Lucy Show" since I have only seen about thirty episodes most of being color.
For my generation, this was fun for its time - even though re-watching it NOW, as an adult...I can see what my parents were talking about.
I could have done without the sexual innuendo and wise cracks though   " I think you`d better step outside "  " No thanks I don`t have time for a < Sexual act > "  Not sure if I`d be watching the TV series on a regular basis after watching this feature length spin off
As for the animation, I'm not an expert but the friend I went to the movie with who is one says to tell you the animals weren't veridical, the humans' hands looked weird and some often the movements were real awkward, though the dragon was awesome.
Its as though the lines are tailored for Miller himself, it is perfect shtick for him.
The horror sequences, though sometimes cheesy, are great fun to watch.
Overall, though, I thought perhaps the strongest performance was Sam Elliott's as Rusty's sometime lover Gar.
Ever since he was born, Rusty delivered tough love towards her son, not to the point where he'll suffer a nervous breakdown, but just as way to keep him motivated and to blend in with people his own age like as though he was a normal child, without taking advantage of his deformity.
Rocky also falls in love with a blind girl who even though she is blind,she loves rocky for who he is.
At first he's just a confused foreigner who knows nothing about America, but then we discover that, even though he is, he's also a smart, happy guy who just loves being who he is.
Even though he appears to be brutish and tough, he just seems like a normal, curious George who must take a lot of chit from people.
She's not though, she's just feisty.
He doesn't react though, he just takes it in.
This is a classic small film-it works wonders on the small screen- imagine what it could do as a blockbuster, though it's small screen image gives it an extra boost.
The last episode played in Helsinki and tried to be dramatic though for me it failed as you cannot feel so much for characters you hardly know about.
If you take each story by itself, though, with an open mind, you will find yourself being entertained (mostly) in five different ways.
And though the movie wants to re-write some of the epic, you will need to separate the Hollywood version from the beautiful measure of the original works.
Even though most of Beowulf's story line is answered here, it did make me pause and wonder:  Why didn't Robert Zemeckis just direct this thing in real life instead of virtual?
The dragon is excellent, the ugly v/s the beautiful is wild, the sequencing is uneven, though at the end it takes you on a great ride.
I couldn't get a solid feeling from the audience though most people as they left seemed genuinely happy with their experience.
His methods are amusing though; the best being the the pop-up barrier he installs in the road, of course it doesn't work when the Roadrunner goes past but a few minutes when Coyote is using "Acme Triple-Strength Fortified Leg Muscle Vitamins" which enable him to run so fast he literally sets the road on fire this barrier springs up just in time for him to run into it.
I know this is an animated movie,where the animals talk and not a documentary.But I wonder if maybe it was made in response to it.I saw this on cable a long time ago,when I was 10.The movie is about a little fox cub,named Vuk, who decides to wander off from the safety of his den.He lives with both his mom and dad,and shares the den with many young,sleepy siblings.Before he even returns home though,he is greeted by his uncle,who has some unsettling news.While he was gone,an evil farmer and his two stupid mongrels killed his entire family.His uncle helps raise him,and they have some fun and exciting adventures.Later on when he is grown up,he and his uncle rescue a vixen named Panny from a cage.The farmer had caught her and put her in there to kill her,or trap Vuk and other male foxes.
It seems as though the young blind girl is the only survivor of some grisly attack not long ago, though, and she isn't doing very well, mentally.
No sex or nudity present though this time, which was a bit of a surprise.
Don't let Antropophagous: The Beast's reputation, plus these gory factors fool you though.
To those of us who have seen a bunch of these movies, though, the impact isn't as severe, but I find his unflinching ability to shock rather amusing.
The hype is more than enough to get people to see the film, though it's tame by today's standards.
As to the two real famous bits, well, if the principle sounds really gross to you than the scenes probably will be, though if jaded like me, they'll most likely just make you grin.
Personally, though not quite my top Italian horror outing, I thought this was really rather awesome stuff.
I think I missed a few episodes though, like the 2nd last one.
I hate how they canceled the show right at that point, it drives me nuts thinking about it.I wish they had of even starting filming the 3 series with those actors now, even though most of them are in their thirties and a few of the older actors are dead, but it would still be interesting.
The commercials made it look like a typical weekly teeny-bop High School show, a la "Saved By The Bell," but in Prime-Time (lest we forget Zach did go to college in the evenings though).
Even though I checked this movie out for free, it was a huge waste of my time.
This film has some excellent aspects, though.
Even though it was a little slow, Stanley Tucci and Tony Shaloub are phenomenal (why there was no Oscar nominations I'll never know).
It is a fine counter-point to the often loud and vulgar fare from Hollywood and in many ways is reminiscent of a foreign film (particularly the excellent German film "Mostly Martha"), though it was made in the good old USA.
But the film, though sweet, also establishes an undertone of such mournfulness that the viewer is not surprised when Prima never shows up, in fact, was never going to show up; it was a brutal trick by Pascal, who recognizes the brothers' abilities, so that they would be forced to close the restaurant and, he hopes, go to work for him.
The small part of the car salesman played by Campbell Scott contributes more than its fair share of great lines, incl..."beautiful place though, Italy...yes it is, have you been?...no, never".
That was more religion-drama and not comedy though.
The first time it almost frustrated me too much for an immediate response, even though I did like certain parts.
A bit of advice, though.
The other assorted crew are great though.
I have a confession, which is that I am not always impressed with the acting of Gary Cooper, though I do love him, and this was one of those times.
Definitely recommended though it's not Cooper's best work.
Last-minute heroism ensued: Billy, sick in body and spirit **spoiler** persisted in his suit with a fairly standard speech (I though acted appropriately with weakened voice and manner because the man was sick) about doing the right thing for the greatest number, and that his country ranked even higher thn himself and all the generals present.
Nevertheless though this is great stuff, for some inexplicable reason we have two different actresses playing the lead role of Conchita.
I'm a New Zealander, and even though I have a fairly good handle on my country's history, I found what I watched to be quite believable.
even though it was made many years ago, it stands up as a great film, wonderfully acted and directed.
I found this movie quite interesting, even though I'm not Swedish and I don't know a lot about Swedish politics.
Had some great dark comedic moments though probably greatly exaggerated from McGahan's own experiences.
I'd say a lot of Andrew McGahan's novel would be autobiographical as he went to The University of Queensland though dropped out before finishing his Arts Degree.
Pretty bland (some nice lighting though at parts).
Eventually it settles into a good groove though and towards the later part of the film the pace has adjusted itself comfortably.
All in all an interesting treatment of an ancient theme, but not one of Bunuel's best, even though it was his last at age 77.
Note: Bob Fosse is not a singer - though he tries hard.
I gave it 8/10 though because the game is a lot of fun to play and the multiplayer is excellent.
This film isn't for everyone - it does get a bit gross - which I loved - but you may not - though it isn't quite as gross as listening to a George W. Bush speech.
I don't know how Rusty Nails (the director) managed to mix film noir, horror and science fiction and make it all fit together into a workable, though experimental film, but I liked it.
There are definitely some gross moments in the film but they're not mean spirited - more just gross out humor - though more funny than gross.
Problem is though, the prosthetic zits are bald-head wigs, sort of, and there isn't one of the people involved where you can't clearly see that.
The music ain't half bad though.
The most gruesome scene, though, was left to the imagination.
I have to say that this film was eastwoods better works of history.The ability to bring out the real feelings in people about how we view the human race in general.I enjoyed this film for the simple reason that WWII was a turning point in how we see each other.How to come together in the highest need to overcome obstacles in the darkest hour.As the flag was raised and having a photographer just at that moment to take a picture of the flag being raised,coincidence flew out the door.But the film goes further as we see each one remembering the pain it created,from a simple misunderstanding about who gets what flag and why.If anything the flag should have went to the soldiers who fought there at iwogima.But like the narrations pointed out,it was a forgotten past and the hero's also forgotten.It's sad to think that the human race no longer sees why war is not necessary,just as long as money is made in the name of war is what it's all about.They were right though,without the money it would have been lost to the Japanese at least that part of the world.But in reality it would still be Japanese soil.This film impacted on all sorts of levels,financial gain through war,the soldiers dying because of money being made,artillery paid for by millions of people,and the suffering going home without so much as a thank you for keeping the world safe.In reality the soldiers who fought and died i would like to call real hero's.No matter what flag was planted,and why today most of the yesteryear men and women are nearly gone.I have to say this film gave me a bit more understanding why war is becoming a thing of the past.We don't need it and don't want it,flag or not we need this world safe and i think Mr. Eastwood gave us a good vision of it becoming a reality.So go ahead make his day.
Even though the narrative was indeed disjointed, if you have the attention span, you can figure it out.
Even though the film was two and one-half hours, it didn't feel like it.
So why does Flags of our Fathers still get 3 Â½ stars even though the comments seem so negative?
The three men did not believe they were heroes, even though the American public did.
Clint Eastwood directed the film, and he didn't pull any punches in the battle scenes, even though the battle for Iwo Jima was considered one of the bloodiest against the Japanese in the Pacific.
As I said, the plot is really not the core of the film, even though it was written by Luc Besson.
Even though Bridget Fonda comes off as a weak, cry baby as she overacts her way through the movie, it adds another dimension to the action scenes to make them so exciting.
Those two fights in particular even though they are choreographed, look very REAL and are as hardcore as they come!
Nice movie, but with a slightly thin storyline (but i didn't expect a fair drama though) Written partly by my favorite director ...luc besson, quite noticeable though.
although i really like this movie ....i still wouldn't want a kiss of the dragon though (you'll understand after seeing the movie)  Germy
Once he feels he's got exclusive rights to her in his country house, he immediately tries to set her up in his late wife's room - as though she's a new acquisition to replace an old spot left empty.
The only easy thread to denote is perhaps that one actress plays the more "French" side whereas the other plays the more "Spanish" side -- as though the character is meant to be Spanish, she grew up partially in Paris.
One is thing certain, though, our hero won't be taken without a fight... a really good fight... and a few more after that.
Michael Qissi, though he does and OK job with the stunt choreography, should not direct.
This is a mostly forgotten film today, though it deserves to be seen.
I thought Emma was a bit too old for him though, and the fact that Jason looked too young to have a fifteen year old son!
Even though Emma's role was uncertain at times just having Jason's presence in the movie made everything worth watching again...and again...and again...
You have to take Big Brother lightly though.
Never a truer word spoken here though & FOR TWO REASONS.
At least no one has to suffer this show any longer as the T.V stations have now come to their senses and taken 'Brother' off the air, though why it lasted as long as it did in the first place is beyond me.
I like this setting even though it has been used before.
The guy who plays harry takes the show though, i don't even remember his name and i'm too lazy to go look here for it, but point being he is a really good actor and i'll look for him in the future.
Don't expect too much from this one though, just suspend all belief and strap in for a good ride!
There's some suspense in this crime-noir from uneven director Richard Quine, though actually "Pushover" is more successful as a character study, with Fred MacMurray miscast but not-bad as a conflicted good cop who decides to step into the gutter.
Fred MacMurray offers an eerily familiar, though less inspired, repeat of his performance in the Wilder classic; Kim Novak (in her first film) is no match for Stanwyck, nor did she ever become one; Richard Quine simply was not as fine a director as Hitchcock or Wilder.
Suspicion falls on the janitor at the high school though, mainly because he's big & weird.
I just love the name of the production company though - Aeriola productions!
I just love the name of the production company though - Aeriola productions!
Nice outdoor shots though; after viewing the film and before looking it up I would have sworn due to it's sort of dated execution (even for the time) that it had been made several years before this (even with the exception somewhat of the hair 'styles' and such which slightly may have indicated a tad more toward 1985) ALL of these people have done MUCH better!
Don't go out of your way to watch this, though as I said, it WILL pass the time.
I watch it every time it's on tv even though I own it on video.
But though Lizardo's trial run with the overthruster failed, it did put him in contact with alien beings from another realm, one of whom-- Lord John Whorfin-- has since that encounter inhabited Lizardo's mind and body.
If you're a fan of British humor, you should definitely enjoy this one, even though it may take more than one viewing to catch all the subtleties.
The work is all too good to be mini, though.
I've now seen it a couple of times, once when I was a lot younger (and it didn't impress me then) and again more recently and though I don't regret watching it, its hardly a good film.
The film moves along fairly smartly once it gets to business and though it only briefly registers as exciting, it has its fun passages.
The special effects are weak, actually, even though this movie falsely raises the impression of being gory and trashy.
It didn't have a "feel-good" happy- skippy ending, but it didn't have a "everyone dies" ending, which I appreciate (though the ending does confuse me a bit...) The creature design was brilliant.
Ed (James Cagney) can, though, by inviting him to the fights.
The railroad setting, though, was something I have never seen dealt with in such a fashion (and makes me wish an "Atlas Shrugged" film could have been made when trains were still important).
(It must be said that 'dialogue' is a misnomer though Â 'portentous and gnomic speech about life, death and weltschmerz, whilst looking in a completely different direction from the supposed interlocutor', would be a more accurate description of it).
This one though is truly awful.
Overall, an average 'teen comedy', but to enjoy do not take it seriously, or else you will feel as though your life has been wasted.
Even though "Girl Fever" (other title "100 women") is a fantasy piece at best, the way it's done is so idiotic beyond even the most clichÃ© rubbish ever done in cinema.
With the existing technologies it could have been done better, but after all I can only conclude that, even though it is "only" TV, this series doesn't disenchant and its main merit is probably the the fact that Bulgakov now found a much bigger audience than he ever could have had with his books.
It might be good if you're about 11 years old, even though I doubt it.
It is yet another mission to Mars film, but this time it is filmed as though it is live TV coverage of the final stages of the mission- with background interviews etc to fill the gaps.
Its not an issue of "accuracy" (even though an acquaintances mother who is a teacher of literature in Russia and read this 20 times cover to cover was very satisfied) it is an issue of originality.
Journey to Mars is a great TV-movie, even though it has quite a few scientific errors (as how they conquered the speed of light - which is necessary to send instant transmition from Earth to Mars - which takes 4 hours each way with today's radio-technology - maybe they use some kind of Tachyon-beams?
Herein lies the movie's basic message and it's an important and humane one, conveyed in fairly subtle fashion, though the turn-around occurs more quickly than I would have liked.
I feel that it has aged relatively well though due to the largely excellent characterizations created by the actors and author.
All too often, films seem derivative and predictable, though this film excels in being different and placing Gregory Peck in a very unusual role--that of a fighter-bomber pilot fighting for the British Empire during WWII.
It also contains a few too many stiff upper lipped chaps   I do give credit to the movie for bringing some type of psycological thought to the story though .
To me, the film depicted courage at it's best, and as said by a previous critic , a simple story, with no over blown heroics,a good and believable cast, and a most enjoyable though somewhat predictable conclusion.
I'm sure many teenage boys enjoyed it just for Jessica Alba (though I admit I had a crush on her myself when I was a teenager) but I still loved it.
It was a show that the whole family could watch and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys wholesome family entertainment or good shows in general ( though I would suggest watching the original seasons).
Jeff Bridges also comes up a winner as Tucker even though he does not have a golden statuette to prove it.
Like they're so good that they could be put right up against some of the essential scenes in the director's films (almost up there, though not quite, with the Wagner bombing in Apocalypse Now and Vito Corleone's death scene).
Boy, what a frustrating film to watch....even though it is very good and has been a part of my collection for a number of years now.
If you are a fan of William Hellfire, Joey Smack, Misty Mundae, or E.I./Alternative Cinema (even though this isnt an e.i.
Probably what's the most offensive though is the poor production values and the possibly even poorer acting.
if the controversy was so intense that the FBI had to get involved (though i can't understand why), that might be the only historical value this film has.
Brian Blessed's Augustus is comic relief, but one that carries a big stick even though his wife is paving the way.
I won't add to the many superlatives ascribed to this wonderful series, well-deserved though they are.
On a second viewing, (all the way through, this time), the Uncle Olie character is not so freaky, and the whole film is very nicely done, though the sound quality is a little off and the opening titles are still very trippy.
Enough of that though.
Having watched Nowhere to Run though, I think I can take a pretty good stab at CRACKING THE CODE.
He soon as he sees how ruthless these dudes are though, and comes to his senses.
One lady though, ain't budging because of it's 'sentimental' value and she'll even tolerate thugs killing her cattle and threatening her life with hooks to keep this ramshackle property.
Joss Ackland is also excellent as one of the main villains, didn't have much screen time though.
He befriends a little boy (not in the Michael Jackson way, though the boy in question is, ironically, Macaulay Culkin's younger brother, Kieran) and consequently gets rather chummy with the boy's mother.
Even so, the film is hardly the heady brew of erotica and visceral thrills that was the latter (though it contains similar lesbian undertones and the occasional outburst of shocking violence) but rather a deliberately-paced mood-piece Â in fact, it might best be described as REPULSION (1965) in the countryside (with all the inherent eeriness that such a remote setting entails)!
Interestingly, the lead role is played by Angela Pleasence Â daughter of horror icon Donald; just because she's his spitting image, the actress' odd looks are perfect for her mentally unbalanced character (though I doubt Larraz intended it to be a serious case history, there is the singular fact of SYMPTOMS being one of the competing entries at that year's Cannes Film Festival to consider!).
Still what I find brilliant and special with this film, is that all though child abuse is a main theme, it is still a film where you laugh.
This is Reyes' first chance to do comedy, I guess Doggett's as well, though it doesn't feel like it because of all his clever one-liners we are used to hearing.
The music is catchy and contagious, the dialogue is funny and entertaining, and though it seems "improbable", Improbable is one of the best episodes of season nine.
Then the mockumentary melts away into a horror movie where you *think* you know exactly what's going to happen even though every time you think you know what's going to happen you're wrong, then every time you guess and you're still wrong.
Don't ask me how I came to my (relatively high) rating, because there was no real highlight beside the well-written script, actors were good (not more), camera-work was really good (nothing special though), editing was fine (but nothing special), sound was fine (but nothing special), but nevertheless I would highly recommend watching it together with a girl, a big bag of popcorn and a beer.
He laughs and jokes and talks to the film-making team as though they were making a documentary about his collection of rare toy cars than about his habit of brutally murdering large numbers of people.
Even though the characters were filming a documentary i think they should have used it for the whole film it would have given a better perspective on things.
The interesting twist in this movie though is that you are presented with the side of the killer and his preparations going into the night of killings.
The blond of the crew got annoying near the end though, but there was a reason behind it.
There are some shortcomings though.
Overall, though this is a very entertaining mockumentary/slasher that is a must have for any slasher fan or any horror fan in general.
But it makes use of those clichÃ©s as though they were some kind of training course for the demented killer.
If you're into the genre, though, there's no way you should miss this excellent motion picture.
Clearly this in an innovative film, though I also think it suffers from two major problems.
Hey one thing I couldn't knock though, even though it looks cheap however the CGI was competently executed and never overdone in any way.
More predominantly though, I believe it is about the bonds that are forged from one person to another in a variety of relationships and the strains that can test them.
And it is not animated in today's flawless though empty androidal style.
The direction though was glacially slow and for many moments, my attention drifted to other things than the movie, which ain't a good thing.
This is as depressing as the rest of the specials, though not as much as the Christmas one.
I have to say though that 10 years later as a manager and agent for musicians (not rock'n'roll and certainly not on the scale presented in the film) I had a whole new appreciation for people who possessed one undeniable talent yet made life hell for those who worked to help them make a living at it!
Bottom line though is that this is a fine film and a very accurate record of how an unstable performer can run herself into the ground.
So it must be admitted that Alan Bates is very good here, though his character is such a thoroughgoing villain it is hard to care anything for him: as Rose's manager and therefore the person spending the most time with her, you would think he could tell exhaustion from temperament; here he is merely a sadistic monster and definitely plays a role in Rose's final destruction.
Unlike Laura, he is more open in his disdain for his mother and her annoying ways...yet he eventually does what she wants AND is still at home though he looks to be in his 30s.
There is a heck of a lot more I could say about the film and the Wingfields, though frankly you'd probably do a lot better reading a critical analysis or more in-depth summary.
Based on what they were allowed to say and do in 1950, it's pretty good and the performances were excellent--though it is odd that Amanda Wingfield's children DON'T have the accent that she has.
I had to keep watching this movie, even though some of the acting was cringe worthy.
Looking back though, there are painful reminders that Danger Island was not meant to end like this, but made to pave the way for a TV series, which never took off unfortunately (unless you can count Lost).
In all though very intriguing characters and all work well together as a group.
Even though the direction is uneven (but gets better in the last half) it carries a powerful message which still has meaning 3 decades later.
On its own terms though, it isn't terribly good.
Even though the cheese factor in this episode is through the roof you can see that the plot line is starting to come together and get very interesting.
So everyone is not naked, and no one uses four letter words, and the lead heroine is a virgin even though she is engaged - to the wrong guy of course.
They make up for it though by being very attractive, personable, likable, and and the script and dialog is better than they are, so it carries them and the show along.
Apparently he's a pretty responsible youngster and has never lost anything...ever, because 15 years later Flash is STILL wearing the Timex watch that his father gave him... uh.. OK.  2) why would Ming send a flying probe though the portal?
The series has had a somewhat rocky, though adequate, start.
Hey Flash the princess is here, shes got a gun and can recognize the I-mex immediately, even though its disguised and she doesn't know what a TV remote is or what the I-mex looks like.
While great comedy should often appear effortless, that doesn't mean that the word should be taken literally, though on one level Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles can truly be said to be an effortless comedy.
It's casual fun and a lot of laughs, and though there's a lot of sight-gags and physical humor it's never overblown or slapstick, which keeps the rhythm of the film intact and makes the humor flow quite naturally.
OMG I though for sure I was going to faint from laughing so hectically hard.
Captain Devane (the late Charles Hallahan) was probably the most likable of all of their superiors, though he was a strictly by-the-book cop.
Aside from Wilder the movie was pretty funny though it was boring at times, such as the end, where it turned into an action film more than a comedy, much the same that silver streak did.
Even though it's pretty much an adult film, with swearing, nudity and adult themes, I found it to be hilarious at such a young age and I watched it few times.
There is not a single unfunny moment from the beginning to the end, even though the last act gets serious and suspenseful.
Even though he met his demise at the end, I was happy to see one of the many antagonist (the crooked police officer) killed off (this is where the sheer delight comes in).
Both of them were very funny, though (as I noticed) they were a little different from nowadays comedians, maybe that was even better.
Very funny film, with one of the highlights being Pryor in the prison hospital because he was told he had to have his appendix out, though they had already been removed.
He still spins around in a whirlwind, sometimes through trees and rocks and drilling holes in the ground, and still makes sounds, rarely speaking in complete sentences (though he occasionally shows that he CAN talk normally).
Basically, all the characters contribute something to the show, though obviously some more than others.
They had trouble following the story, even though they have been dissecting Sophocles' words for weeks.
And naturally, since the plot demands it, the most virginal female character just *must* "fall in love" with him, even though she recognizes his purely evil nature.
To get the money fast, she signs up with a shady wrestling organization (even though she was courted by a rival promoter).
Even though, to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including Gays in one shows, sucking American reality show.
I feel as though I am actually visiting these places that I will probably never get to see in my life.
Even though the ending of the movie was a bit too hard to take Peter Falk's performance as bookie Vinnie Glen was one of the best of of his long movie and TV career.
Even though it was an era of sexual freedom that we can barely conceive now, seeing him was shocking.
This was very worthwhile, though, and he was very much an interesting part of the Andy Warhol Pop period.
This kind of 'dream person', though, tells about early childhood, and there is no follow-up about any further relationships with his family, leading one to assume he left them for good, and remains intoxicated with the days when he can still walk the streets and be told he's 'cute.'
He definitely had his audience, though.
It draws part of its inspiration from Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds"(1963)- though in Hitchcock's film the motive and reason for the bird attacks is not clearly defined, whereas in FROGS the viewer comes to understand why the local wildlife has it in for people.
It is rather dated though, in slang and fashion, and it just didn't do it for me.
Jenny Agutter does well as Adela, though she doesn't have much to do.
Rosaleen was described as a stunning brunette, but Eva, though stunning, was frumped down for the role and was blonde.
Aside from gators and a few of the snakes, which were poisonous, it just seemed ludicrous seeing these totally harmless creatures supposedly on a mad killing spree--though none of them actually did a whole lot other than just hop scamper about--after all, they are just cute little critters.
Another had a man killed by bottles of various poisons which cute little lizards pushed off the shelves in a nicely choreographed scene (though none of the reptiles were killed--they just scurried about the dead man's body).
The dopey premise isn't quite played to it's campy potential..in fact the direction is rather subdued(..as are the cast, even though there are some emotional fireworks as the bickering between family members gets sometimes heated) though the kills themselves are often quite laughable.
Director George McCowan, cinematographer Mario Tosi, and editor Fred R Feitshans Jr make sure to establish the presence of frogs, even though they are merely ribbeting and hopping around, en masse, aggravating those attending Milland's gettogether.
The frogs are always there though, watching.
Even though the film can never really top the brilliance of its own tagline ('Today the pond!
So, even though they're simple frogs they look a bit ominous!
"Poirot sees things, madame; it is a habit he cannot change"   The last "Poirot" episode available for viewing up to this point (May 2008), though apparently at least 4 more are on the way.
Demi Moore is lovely, though the blonde hair is not.
Demi Moore as Marina is in earnest even though she gets off to a wrong start by marrying a man she "thinks" is the right one, but her feelings aren't based on solid ground as it turns out.
'Tis of little matter though, whats important is that the radiation has woken up a prehistoric reptilian beast, multiplied it to awesome size and gifted it with the power of deadly radioactive waves that can fry onlookers.
The film has a few problems, its slight and a bit tricky to care about proceedings, it could have done with more havoc, more personality and more of the monster bringing death to individuals, preferably by eating, since the radiation effect looks a little weak in practice even though the burn effects are good.
I do have 2 nice DVDR's though one has The 79 min.
A lot of those guys on The Message Board for this film amaze me though stuff I didn't even know about this film I don't read books or magazine.
I am gonna have to update my Willis O'Brien My Space Page u guys need to check that out also made one of Stop-Motion Greats David Allen & Jim Danforth need to finish Allen's though I will before his B-Day on Oct.
The less said about that work the better, though the scene played well due to the fine editing and music scoring.
Their Paleosaurus- though in some ways reminiscent of the Beast From 20,000 Fathoms-is nonetheless a unique creation, with its long neck and legs giving it a stature that makes it tower over most of its surroundings.
It's the details, though, where the film starts to slip.
The characters in "Escape From New York", though, are what really make the film shine.
But as I already said before, even though I'm normally not a fan of this kind of movies or of the man's work, I must say that I'm glad to make an exception when it comes to this movie.
One problem though; ever since crime rose with 400% in 1987, New York has become one giant and demarcated prison where criminals determine their own "civilization".
In 1996, Carpenter also made "Escape from L.A." and even though it's good entertainment, it can't compete with "NY".
The ending is perfect though, and easily makes up for the film's faults.
Watch "Escape From LA" though to see what this movie should have been.
Things begin well enough, though, with two brothers meandering through life.
I don't remember seeing any sheep though.
Don't get me wrong though, Trainspotting is still a great film but i prefer this.
Many look and sound as though they've been doped.
The contestants are no better though!
It is interesting to see people's real personalities come out among strangers--sometimes people are sneaky, other times they are very noble and allow others to stay on and compete against them even though they pose a greater threat.
The delivery and execution of classic lines are very good, and even though you know exactly what to expect, they still make you smile when they are delivered.
Niller and his very edgy and controlling wife are in the process of adopting a little african girl, when Niller meets the kitchen craving Sus (played with a lot of spirit by actress Sidse Babette Knudsen), a woman who is very hard to forget just like that---even though she has this hip italian boy friend.
Even though Fallon is not the standup that Chris Rock is, but Fallon actually seemed to be having fun...it wasn't a bunch of written one liners pieced together to move the show along...it was Jimmy Fallon having a great time being part of a great show.
Sure Sandler still plays a goof ball with a annoying voice but "Happy Gilmore" makes me laugh even though it doesn't force me to do so.
After Christopher McDonald says "Yeah Right, and Grizzley Adams had a beard", after he walks away the screen goes to the green where all the people are and the car that hits Happy Gilmore later is already crashed even though the seen has not happened yet.
One question though.
RGV must be praised those days for trying something new  One such adventure which was latter tried by others is DARNA MANA HAI(03) of having multiple stories in 1 film  The film however falls short of expectations though it's novel  The different stories are:  Sohail- Antra Bad and boring Acting- Sohail has nothing to do, Antra is okay  Sanjay- Shilpa This story lacks logic which can be ignored but the treatment could be better, especially the portions showing characters making weird faces while eating apples is too much Yet a decent story Shilpa acts very well while Sanjay is okay Rajpal leaves a mark  Vivek- Nana this is the best story and handled very well though it doesn't make much sense and they are flaws but that is forgiven The story makes for an edge of a seat story Acting wise Nana is brilliant as usual while Vivek too does a great job  Aftab- Isha This story which was latter made as GAYAB(03) has it's moments and the scenes involving Aftab and his power is well handled The culmination too is good but some people may not agree with the story Acting- Aftab is very good and Isha is okay  Saif- Boman This story is implausible but entertaining and well handled though flimsy Acting Boman and Saif are superb   Raghuvir Yadav This story is well handled too Acting- Raghuvir Yadav excels  The worst part of the film is the main story which appears too bad and the scenes involving the college friends are badly handled and the culmination of the film too is horrible  Amongst rest Sameera is okay, Gaurav leaves a mark Sushant is okay
D.M.H doesn't scare you though the film has its moments.The film tells the story of 6 college kids whose car breaks down in the middle of a lonely road at night.They finally find a place to stay,and instead of playing some stupid game,they decide to tell each other ghost stories.That is when D.M.H actually picks up I wont get into the details of the story.Every story is interesting.They are scary ,they r weird,there is dark humor.
I think what I liked the best about the movie, though, is that it leads you to believe that it's going to end in a violent way and ends up not doing so.
I hope future projects from these filmmakers have tighter writing, though.
At what cost you may sayÂ Well, lucky for us, both Fallon and Veil seem to love the art of horror and even though this is not a horror film per se, the images portrayed definitely feel horrific in mood and for such a limited budget, really shine here.
If I bought this movie, I would've thrown it away feeling so sorry that I bought it, avoid this at cost and look for better inspirational movie like Matilda even though it might be a little overrated and silly but still worth watching.
No character has any real conviction, though the little girl sure is cute (and for a child actress, fairly talented).
It shows this though in a way only movies can do it with charming dialogue, intense actions, and actors that light up the screen by illustrating many different emotions.
However though, regardless of all that "The Birdcage" still winds up hitting the nail square on the head in terms of delivering to it's audience some astounding energy, superb camp-value and knee-slappingly hilarious jokes/one-liners that are all topped by a nearly uncanny chemistry between the actors.
On the one hand he's someone the chicks dig (though I can't really see the 'it' thing that everyone talks about), and though he may know it, he also seems to realize the truest injustice in life: that we live in a world where we are alone and nothing matters and few others see that.
And though I don't know for certain, it seems to me that this is the point at which Wilbur may have arrived.
It was a good choice to make this movie in English, rather than Danish, and the result is an excellent drama which will apply to most people even though they, like me, may not be much for that sort of movies.
Wilbur is, ostensibly, one of the more selfish characters you're likely to encounter, though I guess he has his allure to the opposite sex.
Alice love all others in her family, though the feeling to everyone is different, but they are all deep and long lasting.
So enlightened, he unwittingly grabs hold of his brother's love, and takes some for his own; Alice, though guilty, is not unwilling.
But Alice does not waiver in her love for Harbour, and even though they /can/ hurt him, neither she nor Wilbur is willing to go that far.
There has been some debate, of course, over the definition of a "feature," and, though some recorded boxing matches ran for longer, they did not possess a standard narrative.
"Hold That Lion" is still a gem, though.
The rest was hilarious as well especially with the title animal causing havoc with the boys and scaring an African-American porter played by Dudley Dickerson though one may pause a little bit before laughing since that was a stereotype of that race at the time.
In fact is seems as though writer Harris didn't really have any room for any of the characters except for Woods central cop, with the rest all pretty much falling by the wayside.
Even though he always seems in control, we are constantly aware that he is being stared at (even before this becomes a narrative element), that he is stuck in the frame.
Charles Durning is also very good, as is Lesley Ann Warren, though I just wanted to slap her character a couple of times for being so stupid and whiny.
It seems as though as the popularity of Japanese (and other Asian) horror films increases, more and more of these barrel-scrapers are appearing in my local video emporium.
There are a few saving graces, though, which saved this movie from getting an even lower score from me.
Even though it is a bit stereotypical, it was played with charm and energy and is absolutely irresistible.
Instead for that hour we get look at dark rooms and more rooms, in many different stylish ways- but then something actually happens and it picks up in the last 15mins, though people might have given up already and I wished I did.
Anyway, the plot is fairly solid, though I did find at least one of the ending plot twists useless and incomprehensible, but since it really affected nothing else in the film, I ignored it.
This was not that type of movie and I am upset that it was on this station even though it is one of the most horrifying movies out there.
Even though, in 2009, we'd like to believe the neighbors, CPS or the police would step in, I fear that is not the truth.
Allow me to quote the last line, as the main character sits thoughtfully by the river he met "Meg Laughlin" (aka Sylvia Likens) on so many years before: "I will never forget the gift of Meg Laughlin, though I am plagued with the torment of failing again...failing somebody...But as she taught me, it's what you do last that counts."
I won't watch this a second time, but surely its art, though not the pleasant kind.
As obvious as the storyline was, and as overwrought the acting was, I was sucked in nonetheless, to see how it ended, even though you could see it coming from miles and miles away.
A hilarious musical besting Trey's earliest forray into film "Alferd Packer, The Musical" (also in this DB, though that one not R rated) This is NOT..I repeat NOT a movie for the kids.
It certainly seemed uncut, even though it wasn't.
Not only because the TV show (South Park) is one of the best animated shows of the 90's but also because of it's comedy, political and social satire, and though you can't see it right away, a look into censorship and what bad and good qualities it's doing to American life.
Stacy is laconic and quite understated, though that makes him somewhat more believable.
Originally a play by Spike Milligan, I have a feeling that on paper the movie would seem hilarious and though a couple of scenes translate well (the tube train that keeps running even though no one needs it and the wedding) most of the skits fall flat.
Watched it recently, and still laughed out loud, even though nuclear annihilation is not much of a hot topic.
Even though the characters are stereotypical, the script has obviously been written by someone who doesn't intend to contribute to the stereotypical view of the gay drag community, but who rather wanted to create characters that are lovable while at the same time shouting "don't take us seriously".
The script is amazing, and even though it may really be too over the top once in a while, it doesn't distract from the overall picture.
Hijinks ensue, and though bleak at times (a few shades light of a dead baby joke), Richard Lester's madcap "The Bed Sitting Room", is one of those odd, clever, allegorical comedies, that's just too smart for it's own good.
I loved this short from the first time I saw it as a kid, and I think it's one of a kindness really makes it his best (though others are quite funny.)
From the director of Fight Club another great storyline and twist at the end, even though Fight Club is exceedingly more violent than Se7en, they are both made the same way and both have such great acting and story lines, that this movie cannot be passed over.
As its own entity, though, it's pretty forgettable.
Powered by some blue- energized meteor, it's like a tale of renewable energy sources that spells the future of mankind's effort in maintaining a paradise that is Metro City, though the by-product waste in red-energy is fairly unstable, and makes for a good source of power for the evil President Stone (Donald Sutherland) and his warmongering robot ironically called The Peacekeeper, in a kooky plan for re-election.
Narratively, this film was safely stuck in "safe" mode throughout, and there were some shades of other super-powered films that can be seen here, such as an ending mimicking Pixar's The Incredibles, or inspired by Bryan Singer's Superman Returns in that Atlas lift of a troubled, enormous piece of land, and what every self-respecting origin super-hero movie will have, a montage or set action sequence of the initial discovery of powers, which allowed for Astro Boy to show off in some ways, his uncanny abilities, some of which though you'll have to wait until the final battle for it to be discovered, and exploited.
Kristen Bell and Freddie Highmore were pretty good, though.
It's such a brilliant mix of everything, personally I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I know I'm probably too old to like that sort of stuff but I watch anything me if the trailer looks good, I'm more into CGI/animation movies, there's soo much more that they can do compared to live-action and if Astro Boy had been live-action then it wouldn't have been as good because they wouldn't have been able to accomplish half the stuff they did in the CGI version, hell I don't even know how they managed with the live-action series back then :S But seriously, if this is your kind of movie, don't listen to what the bad reviews are telling you, experience it for yourself and just watch it, because it is a really fun/thrilling movie that can really make you smile, just as it did with me :)  Another good thing is that they haven't changed anything too drastically, normally when a movie is adapted from TV or a book they tend to change it, sometimes too much but I feel that they have changed it only slightly so that it appeals greater to our modern ages, the great thing though is that Astro is the same.. you know, same name, look, even the undies... but at least he's wearing clothes.. well up until the end... ha ha :D Although I'm not really sure what to think about the new characters apart from the RRF who are just hilarious, but I guess some of the others resemble or remind me of the old ones but the one in particular is Cora, who is mean't to be seen as a potential love interest for Astro (I think...) is just not needed really, I mean she's probably there just to fill up the space, I don't think there's an actual reason, I mean I can't see them getting together and stuff... but maybe that's just me.
It did feel as though the voice work was done after visuals and not vice versa which led to a somewhat flat performance by some actors.
The animation is strong, though it is a little too Western in appearance at times, and it would have been nice to see a bit more anime style.
The story is full of tragedy, though decisions that if you think them through you can even understand (like a father understanding that memories cannot truly replace his son), and redemption that may be obvious to superheroes experts, but are very well exposed to a new generation of kids that will witness a clear fight between good and evil (positive and negative forces) adorned with an excellent and adequate portion of comedy.
Some of the transitions between scenes seemed awkward and occasionally it was unclear exactly what was supposed to be happening, though I find many films based on books have this problem.
Even though the effect wears off after repeated viewing, you can always remember the way you felt after your first experience with this movie.
There's so much information and logic throughout, I almost felt as though I had gained knowledge by watching it.
The differences reflect different target audiences, though.
This film was leagues more interesting that I expected it to be--my girlfriend REALLY wanted to see it, though.
And it's mostly a family film but there's some language kids might repeat the next day at school (and get in trouble) and there's some very strange violence :)  Well worth a shot, though.
Square's transformation as though it were our own, which it hopes to be.
But the worst part is, though some men are behind this kind of slave market, the main flesh-eating character is a white woman, a false blonde, divorced with an 11 year old son abandoned to her own parents.
And I was into it and entertained the whole way though.
HONESTLY though this is one hell of a boring film, i actually felt physically weak by the end of just watching it.
This is lost on Mills though, whose level of clarity never reaches the same level.
This is a minor flaw though because the story is so well and so shockingly told.
I didn't know anything about this movie before I rented it, but being a seasoned horror/thriller movie lover I though I would try it.
I felt like switching it off about 20 minutes through, but I didn't and along it plodded until to my eternal shame it made me jump, just the once though.
I rented this at blockbuster because it had professional looking packaging and even though I figured it was a "B" grade horror movie, I at least thought it was done professionally.
Sorry, SeÃ±or Bigas Luna: I do not like your films, though I must admit you do have talent and ideas, concepts and visualizations for making films Â it is just that, as far as I am concerned, you've gone up a dead-end street/cul-de-sac/calle sin salida.
The young Oliver Hardy has a role here and does a good job, though his main task is to eat copious amounts.
Even though I found this distressing, I had to give Billy West credit for accuracy ... since several genuine Chaplin shorts from this period also include Jewish stereotypes.
I tell you one thing I did not say though, "This movie was horrible, it's the worst movie ever".
Even though he was supposed to be a selfish womanizer, he did have certain qualities that made me sympathize with him.
(For example, he did come to Willie's aid when he was thrown out of the party by the bigots, even though it meant giving up a chance with one of the few women in the movie who didn't flat out ignore his come-ons.)
As usual, the villain, John Doe played by Kevin Spacey, provides a chilling performance, even though he is not given as much center stage as, say, Anthony Hopkins was in Silence of the Lambs.
In general, the serious episodes of the show are rated much higher than the comedic episodes--even though I think that the occasionally funny episodes are a great relief from a constant barrage of overly serious themes.
This one, though often maligned by the "experts", is truly delightful (and yes...I realize that comedy is very subjective).
In one sense their relationship is the ultimate clichÃ© -- the old veteran cop paired up with the brash rookie (though Mills is not actually a rookie, just new to the unnamed city where the movie takes place).
Even though I thought I knew the big picture before.
Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis did a remake (called "Living It Up", though I somehow remember the title as "Homer Flagg") and I remember at the time thinking that that version was MUCH better, but what did I know?
I wouldn't call this a screwball comedy, though.
Just saw this "classic" on AMC and even though it's very hard to make me laugh, there are 2 EXTREMELY funny lines (won't spoil them for you) regarding things that are written in letters penned by the Carole Lombard character.
Just coming off his classic dramatic turn in the most cohesive version of "A Star Is Born", stalwart leading actor Fredric March gamely plays the initially cynical Wally with the right everyman demeanor, though I kept thinking how much more at home William Powell or Cary Grant would have been in the role.
The lovable Lombard makes Hazel a sublime comic creation even though the character is basically a selfish charlatan.
One of the first movies filmed in Technicolor, it still looks pretty good though there is subtle graininess and typical for a film of this age, a constant popping noise exists in the background.
If this sort of thing, even though MEANT to show hypocricy, bothers you, skip this one, I mean it.
When you think about Anna Nicole Smith though Nothing Sacred appears dated it actually has a very timeless message about the power of media to create and destroy.
Right now, the current hoax is the nomenclature used to describe the appointing of the Cabinet, as though the election were a fait accomplis: "Andrew Card, the president's new appointee......" and other such insiduously assumptive language has been used before, as this movie wonderfully points out.
It may seem as though the role of Tracey is a pointless part, but she is more important than anything.
He has an arrogant sense of things though is 'by the book' and works.
Brad Pitt delivers a kind of forced performance which adds to the Hollywood effect of the film though I couldn't imagine anyone else for the part.
Even though I knew it was his first--and therefore probably cheesy--I still hoped for something of value.
It is also better and much richer in its story and horror metaphor though the characterizations are slightly more shallow than in "Dawn of the Dead."
In fact, it doesn't waste ANY time getting on with that, opening with a scene that intercuts a new couple being shown around the complex with the graphic strangulation and dissection of a young girl (I might add though NOT a minor as many have suggested).
When I first tried to watch this film, I was around ten or eleven and though it was lame, boring and disturbing.
Of the acting, Barbara Steele stands out the most, though her role isn't too big, she is as majestic a horror queen as she was when she began and the role makes best use of her.
The film is watchable throughout though it does feel often like somewhat of a b movie.
The ending is fantastic though, showcasing Cronenbergs subversive wizardry.
(Considering the plot of SHIVERS, though, you may want to keep your mouth shut...as much as possible!)
You feel as though you are watching real people in danger.
Cronenberg's debut feature, though a little worn around the edges, is a spectacular funhouse, a dire warning, a potent sexualized anxiety creation, and best of all, a whole lotta fun.
Payton is good as his romantic interest, though.
In this respect, the film doesn't "preach" any special meaning even though the film's moral statements are still maintained.
The annoying teens are portrayed by a talentless bunch of nobodies and they deliver their lines as though reading off a board.
Even though I watched the film only for JTT, I found out the whole movie was great!
You will like this movie if you are open minded, or dealing with sexuality in itself - for me this movie provided a sense of homage, to know that I'm not alone, even though I know I"m not but this is a step for diverse sexualities and its acceptance.
Overall, though, it is an excellent show and a must see for everyone to get a glimpse of the gay experience in America.
Even though I know my emotional buttons are being pushed, I still enjoy every word and aspect of this film.
The film is well worth your time though, and offers an early glimpse at the amazing technique that dominated Kurosawa's later films.
Stray Dog, on the other hand, takes place in post-War Japan and travels its mean streets convincingly, though, truth be told, it also features Toshiro Mifune (thankfully in one of his better and less histrionic performances).
Sato sees that his young partner is going through the stages of exhaustion and tries to get Murakami on the right track and brings up the film's key symbolism, a rabid stray dog (even though rabies are extremely rare in Japan).
There was always a surprise around the corner, whether one of pace or image or sound or performance or turn of the narrative - though in fact it's a very straightforward story, told in a linear fashion, but that description really doesn't do justice to a sequence such as when we go to the ballistics lab at the police station, Mifune learns about a bullet found at the scene of a crime, and then he dashes off without any warning - and we follow him - to a shooting range at which we'd seen him early on in the film, retrieving a spent bullet of his own, and then we dash back to the ballistic lab, and then go into a microscopic close-up POV ballistics man, comparing the two bullets.
The events of the film appear to take place during an extreme heatwave, and the perspiration clings to the skin of the actors as though they are practically roasting in their seats.
This odd little film definitely won't be for everyone though, but it's funny and bizarre and even a bit touching at times.
Obviously, Kurosawa as the director calls the shots in terms of the visuals, his true forte, though this is him still in a young director mode, very confident in his style, though only giving minor fluoride's of style (sometimes quite well).
Here, though, Kurosawa permits Sato to espouse a hardcore law-and-order philosophy: The cops are the good guys, the crooks are the bad guys, and that's it.
Overall, an interesting way to spend a couple of hours though better as a rental than a purchase.
I enjoyed this film, even though I didn't expect to.
SkarsgÃ¥rd is very good as the war photographer, and his final speech, though going very close to crossing over into being clichÃ©, manages to work perfectly and arouse actual emotions in the viewer, rather than just being sappy, manipulative drivel(which this sort of thing almost always is).
Yes, we've seen the plot before (though not so truncated), but the cinematography is grainy, jerky, and alive.
Quel maledetto treno blindato (aka Inglorious Bastards) has risen from the ranks of the rest of the obscure Italian made, American acted cheapies first of all because of Quentin Tarantino's reverence for the film and the fact that he plans to a remake of sorts under the same title; second of all even though Tarantino's word is enough PR to get any obscure film to raise from the depths of the unknown into popular culture, it wouldn't work if the film wasn't any good.
The Inglorious Bastards is a pretty bad movie, though it does stand out as better than most B-movie spaghetti war films.
Even, though many scenes are shot against animated backgrounds, it contains one of the best of it's kind, take notice of the huge field of scrap metal after the Americans have dropped a plethora of nasty bombs.
The french resistance are though and they all speak french and are not clowns.
Bo Svenson heads the cast of mostly unknowns, though Ian Bannen (who has an Academy Award nomination to his credit, though not for this) brings some actorly street cred to the film as a general.
The Italian industry from the 50's to the late 70's thrived by imitating big Hollywood box office hits and even though The Inglorious Bastards came a good 10 years after the WWII action cycle of the 60's, it's still a welcome addition to the genre.
Castellari is no hack though and you can see flashes of his directorial brilliance in the slow-motion intercutting shots in the train, which rival anything Sam Peckinpah has done with the same technique.
He knows he's not doing Citizen Kane though so he doesn't let his "artistry" get in the way of making an entertaining picture.
Michael Pergolani has little to do in his role as the hippie/thief; he does have one great motorcycle stunt scene, though, a la Steve McQueen in THE GREAT ESCAPE.
We must remember though, that he was a pioneer, so his 'trailblazing' gave a path for others to follow.
All in all though for me, it's an engrossing film, and an honest one.
From the tale 'Hold Autumn in your hand' by George Sessions Perry and writing by William Faulkner though he appears uncredited.
It seems as though the Christians check out the privates of all the males and if they're circumcised as Moslems have to do as well as Jews they're summarily shot.
I am a more aware man for having seen this film, and it allows my to deal with bullies I have encountered in real life who on buses will try to play the inquisitor in a menacing fashion, even though here in America we are supposed to be free of this interaction.
According to a recent biography of Alec Guinness though it was never going to be anyone else but him in the role of the Cardinal, Noel Willman had done the inquisitor part on stage.
Not sure what to make of the ending, though, because up to that point, it was utterly realistic.
She so enjoyed all the actors even though Polly Bergen tore a tiara off her head in the wardrobe trailer, citing that "she is supposed to be a floozie, not a princess!!!"
Pug (Robert Mitchum reprising his Winds of War role) has an interesting segment in Russia, but the Pacific War, submarine battles and all, though well done, didn't hold my interest.
I wouldn't say it is unfortunate though.
Even though this "Ham" in the Swiss Alps is trying to talk on 80M with a parabolic dish, I gotta admit, this _is_ a kinda neat movie.
Even though a teen the age of Helen's daughter, she shows great strength and resilience in the face of great adversity.
He blames refugees for taking people's jobs (even though he doesn't think it below him to use them when he sees fit).
I saw it once more last night on late TV and couldnÂ´t stop watching even though IÂ´ve seen it 2 or 3 times already.
Besides, it's very moving: background is highly dramatic, though on the surface you find the funniest comedy.
That doesn't matter though because it's about non-conformists being able to fall in love without sacrificing their individuality.
As Good As It Gets made me feel so good, even though I couldn't really relate to the characters' situations.
Even Leatherface was okay, though his version of the movie was seriously tampered with before release.
In my cynical opinion, they're an excuse to give Peter something to say (the aforementioned line to Edmund) that he will say later (though not in any meaningful way); a popular Hollywood convention, apparently.
It is quickly seen, though, that that prodigious distance to the Witch's house wasn't very great at all, as Edmund is soon shown to be at the castle, with his siblings and the Beavers close behind!
It did feel surprisingly rushed though and I hope this is at least a trilogy from the way they ended it which was also a bit confusing for the audience.
The snow is dubious though, but I guess that is acceptable.
As for the characters, I though the children were reasonably good but I was most disappointed in Liam Neeson as Aslan and Tilda Swinton as Jadis.
I do not think that it will win the best picture Oscar though because it is only the first movie in a series of seven.
Each book though, unlike the LOTR series, is a completely different story with many different characters.
Even though I missed the opening night due to bad Canadian weather, the crowd retained that grand spirit of being one of the first to see a film.
", though.
Ironically though, such a structure might have deprived of us of seeing more of Hoffman doing Lenny's bits 'live' on stage - and for me these were the highlights, which I wish had lasted longer, rather than flashing back to some past event after 30 seconds.
Frankly, though Hoffman has blown me away on various occasions, I don't ever remember being more blown away than this.
It's a movie I can watch repeatedly and enjoy even though it is pretty bad.
There wasn't too much of it though, and there wasn't lesbian scenes or anything like that (though it was suggested by one of the main characters).
I loved this film even though im not familiar with the first two.
of these oaters, the title doesn't really have much to do with the story, though this one comes close.
What I'd like to know though, is how is it that no matter where Cheyenne is at the start of a gunfight, he can always find a way to sneak up behind the shooters?
Most of the characters are played by competent to even talented actors, even though most of them never became stars.
It is a fascinating film though, in its own way.
I really liked this, since GOLD RUSH might just be my very favorite silent film (though it's hard to say for sure, considering some of the great films of Lloyd and Keaton).
The makers of "Lenny" understood Bruce, though.
Seemed lame, middling and far- fetched for the most part even though I like the cast.
This film though takes the risk of being shaped in a documentary-esquire design.
Like most romantic comedies, the premise of THE BACHELOR & THE BOBBY-SOXER really isn't on the firmest of grounds (though why watch a film if you want full-blown reality?).
("You remind me of a man...") Myrna Loy is delightful as well, though woefully under-used.
It's a taut, well-handled entry and though light years short of Letter To Three Wives is nevertheless highly entertaining.
I love that, though he seems at times to be making progress out of his unpleasant and violent existence, you're never quite sure...until the spectacular ending, where everything wraps up beautifully...or does it?
I liked the way in which Audiard managed this though.
This is Duris' picture though.
He is very protective of his father and does not refuse his requests, though he has little respect for him, telling him that the woman he is thinking of marrying is a whore.
But he's 28 and, though he still noodles around on his piano at home, he hasn't practiced seriously for 10 years.
The moment I went out of the cinema hall, I though the combination real estate mobster - gifted pianist was highly unlikely in any case, but rendered almost believable by Romain Duris.
Thomas perhaps eventually finds what his heart missed, though not quite as predicted.
Poor Queequeg though.
Daryl Hannah was much better than Merial Hemmingway as an agent even though they are both good actresses.Doug Savant returns as river guide Grant Carlson, who is on the verge of proposing to his girlfriend Agent Alex McGregor, but it's always a bad timing thing so he doesn't get the chance.
Cooper, the nominal lead, had just had a career resurgence with his Oscar-winning performance in another genre outing â the classic HIGH NOON (1952); as I said in my review of YELLOW SKY (1948), which Iâve just watched, Widmarkâs role here was kind of similar to the one he played in that earlier Western â though, by now, he had begun to stretch effectively from outright villain types.
Marlowe and Haywardâs relationship, too, is typically lukewarm; the latter was one of the foremost dramatic actresses of the era, though she appeared in a fair number of action-oriented pictures.
It is as though the movie is almost a warning to parents, enjoy them now because the little ones you love maybe taken from you at any moment, except, just kidding, that does not really matter because you can always have another and poof your grief will be gone.
Basically, if you stop the movie at the Christmas when the girl is six, it is not bad, it's a cute film, though not worth its rave reviews.
The early part of their relationship is played out fully with the stars' wit and charm as Roger attempts to pick up Julie by buying a pile of records at the store in which she works (even though he doesn't have a record player).
With no extras, the 2002 DVD has a decent enough print, though the film is in need of a more through restoration.
You had better bring some... though not the standard light-hearted fare Dunne and Grant had performed in before, this film is a classic example of an American tear jerker.
The film winds you though these flashbacks while you wait to fall deeper into their despair, knowing it will happen.
Especially Dunne, though beautiful as always, has an aura of experience that does not match the role's innocence and helplessness.
Stevens, perhaps the ablest filmmaker of the era next to Hitchcock, saw the profundity and catharsis in it, and the receptive, insightful control and room to allow his particularly personal vision to make it feel like the experience cinema is meant to be, a chronicle ensuing the life-changing happening of falling in love, and the innate personal longing to make a family and a home with the one you worship, and the trials and grief that can be as intense, though never really more, than the pleasure and gratification it begets.
They are lucky in that the kind head of the agency, Miss Oliver, realizes they have all it takes to be good parents, even though their finances don't add up.
To this day, this movie will hold your attention even though you will find no vulgarity, nudity or violence.
The film is simply huge (though not done on a huge budget) and I bemoan Philip Kaufman's film-making choices since.
Kurt Angle vs Triple H for the WWF Title was very good, though it ended differently than I expected.
Visually, this film is extremely well realized, though the VHS release gives somewhat less evidence of that (it's yet to be put out on DVD).
For a children's film (though I hate to categorize something only as such), it is very good.
So, indeed, Grave of the Fireflies is bleak as hell, but compelling because it doesn't stray from its path with these characters, and that in many scenes we're connected to them without the overbearing heart-tugs of a common Disney feature (though, ironically, as Ebert points out on an interview with the DVD, the big eyes in most anime is based upon those in early Disney films).
Like many films, though this has a "G" rating, you have to see where I stand on that.
So it's not just about war, or anti-war, though I can't think a better movie to watch about war.
The animation is beautiful, though certainly not dated by any means (even though Japanese animation has progressed well since this film was made).
The animation though detailed and indeed beautiful in some sequences (namely relating to the title), is not by any means flashy but captures emotions and interactions between the characters perfectly.
Even though I do feel like Stan's philosophies are a tad outdated and his idea of what a superhero is can get a bit one-dimensional, his challenges on the show do seem to bring out the best and worst qualities in the contestants.
Don't get me wrong though I liked the show, saw most of it in one night when Sci-Fi aired a bunch of episodes straight.
I do love the show though, and it's great entertainment!
Mostly these shows run more as talent shows than as anything else, though (such as American Idol, Fight For Fame and Last Comic Standing), but beyond them there are very few that can even count themselves as decent, let alone good.
I am disappointed that the third place finisher got eliminated though...
I think that it turned into a bit of a soap opera to me with all their wayward children and their love lives :) I could watch the first half where William and Sarah first meet over and over though.
I say that hesitantly though because I have to say that I was very disappointed that almost all of the humor shared between William and Sarah was taken out of the movie.
Consequently, the power of the tale embedded in the libretto by Francesco Maria Piave prompted opera maestro Giuseppe Verdi to write one of his most famous operas LA TRAVIATA basing his content entirely on the story about a deathly ill courtesan who, though does not have long to live due to tuberculosis, finds the true love of her life.
Like Callas, Stratas has a Greek background through her parents though she was Canadian born, has similar looks, has the same type of dramatic voice and she is in Zefferelli's own words "an electrifying actress and soprano of the lyric entertainment".
As viewers, we feel as though we are truly standing in front of "The Music Lesson," observing the intricately crafted world in the frame and contemplating how the work, so many years later, still connects us to its mysterious creator.
The filmmakers took great care in crafting this story and it clearly shows as we follow Matt's journey though the film.
It boasts a fine cast, certainly, but they're not really inspired by the material: Atwill is merely a red herring and isn't even the lead character despite his top billing; Gloria Stuart's role is nothing compared to the one she played in THE OLD DARK HOUSE (1932), though she does get to sing in this one!
And even though the series borrows from easily identifiable sources such as 2001 Space Oddessey and The Good the Bad and The Ugly, it does it with enough finesse not to undermine itself.
Jazz isn't the only music though as they employed some deep African drums for one episode, some boys choir for another, and soft rock music for a lot of episodes.
The three principal character are utterly flawed though superlatives.
With Beobp, though I'm in the middle of which is better here.
He still finds time to squeeze a drop of enjoyment from his difficult life, though, and there is a stunning sequence where the boy and his friends race to the horizon where flaming oil fires incinerate the sky.
Credit Una Merkel, Gloria Grahame, Goldie Hawn, and Brittany Murphy with keeping the Pitts' style alive down though the years.
An exceptional, though a bit old fashioned film.
It just doesn't work though.
Shame though, as this was excellent.
Unfortunately Mr Adams also wrote the screenplay and it's this that is the film's undoing   I'm not much of a horror fan and though I enjoyed the 2002 releases where the British Army let off a few shots at monsters in abandoned houses there's little in this movie to recommend unless you're a horror movie addict
In addition,the script for this 1951 film version either waters down or eliminates several hard-hitting elements in the plot which were rendered extremely faithfully in the '36 version, though it would spoil the story, as well as that 1936 film, if I gave away what those moments are.
I wasn't expecting much from this after a majority of reviewers thought poorly of it, though I was pleasantly surprised.
Long Time Dead isn't without fault though, I found parts clunky and badly written.
The poor reviews are likely to be down to it's release date, and the lack of originality - though I wouldn't worry about that too much.
Said costumes, though this is supposed to be a period piece, have a distinctly late-40s/early-50s flavor.
It is true though......  Long Time Dead a good British horror/thriller movie, with some creepy moments in it, like the flashback scenes.
Although the story has promise, and the ending is somewhat of an improvement, even though it never rises above the clichÃ©, Long Time Dead is too burdened with severe flaws in direction, cinematography (the film is frequently far too dark) and performances to merit a recommendation.
I must admit though that the ending was pretty predictable.
Daniels' obviously prodigious abilities in the martial arts make his level of activity in dispatching the bad guys very believable (even though the extent, circumstances and numbers of adversaries involved may stretch this believability a tad).
The only regular returning character was bumbling pilot Launchpad McQuack but he was my favorite, though Gizmoduck does make a couple of appearances.
He's a crime-fighter with absolutely no abilities other than his determination to beat the bad guys though his is utterly confident in himself and craves media attention.
That's my only complaint though.
He does though, play with our expectations on what would be the natural course of thoughts in our head and he flips them over.
The concept of freedom just fades away behind those curtains even though they are bragged about all the time.
Showing situations that would normally shock anyone, though the characters glide through these incredibly awkward scenarios with ease.
Every storyline weaves into each other seamlessly, and though each of these characters could take up a full film themselves, their individual story lines feel resolved and complete.
I felt as though it went above and beyond typical surreal movies.
When watching this film, I felt as though I was actually dreaming.
The other note is that if you wonder if this structure has ever been repeated or expounded upon, Richard Linklater's first film Slacker comes closest, though with a much different tone and style of comedy.
The way Sarah acted and her ballet was excellent though.
It's all though hardwork and effort that i have put in just like Sarah.
It's true, though, the plot is really lacking in spice and substance but this is to a large extent compensated for by a mixture of fantastic sets and great musical performances.
Musically of course, the film is a masterpiece and though my favourite tune is "Make Believe", I was extremely impressed by the version of Ol Man River sung by the actor William Warfield who must have had one of the most brilliant voices I have ever heard !
Maybe I'm too harsh on the film though.
Dietrich wins though her hero is pretty badly mauled in the final sequence.
And it had the incomparable Paul Robeson though William Warfield is a fabulous Joe.
Having preceded the film by the trio's subsequent (though lesser) teaming, PITTSBURGH (1942), it was interesting to see Wayne and Scott take turns playing the unsympathetic role (in the case of the latter here, he emerges to be an out-and-out villain Â if a charming one, and to which he would return for his swan-song two decades later in Sam Peckinpah's RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY [1962]).
The compelling narrative extends to many an exciting (and, often, action-oriented) development Â trial, bank robbery, jailbreak, train wreck, various instances where law officers face off or shoot it out with miners, and culminating in the famously brutal lengthy fistfight between the two male stars (though this is somewhat spoiled {sic} by the obvious use of doubles in longshots).
The real stars of the film though, are John Wayne and Randolph Scott as miner Roy Glennister and Gold Commisssioner Alex McNamara respectively.
You need someone like Scott around because even though John Wayne's the good guy, he's just a little too sure of himself where Dietrich is concerned.
Even though her heart's with the Duke, Marlene probably liked having Scott around.
Leading men Randoloph Scott and John Wayne make rugged adversaries, though I find Scott somewhat more appealing, which isn't supposed to be the case.
The sets are quite good, and at times quite fancy; and the streets are muddy, though I seem to remember the earlier films as having a more realistic, dirty look, as Alaska here is cleaner and at least physically less forbidding than one might expect.
As to the climactic fight, it is well enough done, and properly violent, though neither participant seems nearly so bloodied up as he ought to.
Even though the starting scene might be a rip-off from the one in "Heat" (and yeah, they even take the hockey masks, lol), and the flashbacks are shown a little bit too much, but i guess its for a reason, to show who the characters are talking about, i guess.
Beware, even though I saw this on USA cable network edited, it is still a pretty violent flick w/ suggested sex & f-bombs ( I could tell what they just said even though it was bleeped out on regular T.V.)
But, the worst were these super annoying flashbacks, as though even the director realized that we couldn't figure out what was going on without help.
Wesley also does a credible job if you can call it that with this scrip, though I use the term credible lightly because he should have his head read for choosing this script !
Every street or boulevard was in a different part of the city, even though the scene looked like the streets came one after another.
In both films the sheriff doesn't have much support when it comes to conscientiously doing his duty.The suspense mounts through both films, though John Agar doesn't match Gary Cooper when it comes to re-acting to it.
Quentin Tarantino, who plays a bit role, speaks English as usual but with some gawky, cartoonish twang and tone of voice with the talent of an 11-year-old and no sense of cultural origin and no connection at all to the subject matter, obscure though it may be.
I don't think Miike has ever made a movie for everyone, even though he's made almost 70 in under 20 years.
It's pretty original/charming in concept, though, and I wonder if Miike wouldn't also like to make a samurai film entirely with Americans speaking broken Japanese.
The sets and costumes are pretty nice for an independent film, though a lot of the interior decor often reminded me of the US interstate food chain, 'Cracker Barrel.'
The action is a combination of really awesome and intentionally terrible, though the shootouts are pretty fun to watch and there are some pretty original moments featuring crossbows and computer-rendered effects.
This is further proof that cult Japanese director Takashi Miike is not for me: as can be deduced from the title, the film is a pseudo-homage to the Italian Spaghetti Westerns (though Django has almost nothing to do with it!).
Anyway, for Miike, this is typically violent fare Â even more pointless than usual and all rather amateurishly assembled; besides, having the actors speak English results in unintentional laughter more than anything else (though Quentin Tarantino's absurd cameo is no less embarrassing: incidentally, I may well have been witness to the genesis of the picture back when these two mavericks 'butted heads' at the 2004 Venice Film Festival!).
It's hard to pin down, though, because the film doesn't really concern itself with such matters.
So, this work could be compared to the Japanese poetic genre "haikai no renga", Ð° comic though quite emotional poem.
This movie is not a deep philosophical opus, it is quite light and easy to watch, though it is for "those, who know".
The blood is pretty generic and typical, though maybe a little more than your standard action flick.
You really have to be a fan of the genres it imitates to understand it fully, even though the plot is simple.
The acting worked for the genre, even though most of it is terrible and hard to understand.
The plot is crazy and very good (though not really original) 2.
What really kills this film though is the confused script which has the characters doing incredibly stupid things.
As I said, I don't usually watch films with this much skin in it but for those who want this in a film, you'll be pretty disappointed--though the men seemed a bit more photogenic in this regard.
What I would like to know, though, is how this lady not only knew what she and her boyfriend were doing (this mostly involved getting naked and her saying 'she wasn't THAT kind of girl' when he later wanted to have sex?!?)
The other guy says "...about a week"--even though the bodies showed no evidence of critters nibbling on the corpses, putrification or discoloration at all and there was fresh blood all about the bodies.
Fortunately its gets shown uncut on television and though it doesn't have any spectacular content, its still pretty toothsome stuff.
The opening 20 minutes, before the expedition is underway, are the most striking, with colorful touches and a slightly wacky approach that the film later loses, though there is good smattering of creepy moments and everything mounts to a pretty fun finale.
Forget those films though this is the highlight of her career--everything else was just practice for this baby!!
The twist ending is a bit silly and underused, though.
The fashions are also very 70's, silly looking sideburns and flares, the women in this film look attractive though, but I'm not sure that a mini skirt and high heeled boots would be a good choice of footwear considering the rocky and rough terrain.
Ther are some attempts at atmosphere and suspense, though most opportunities for a jolt are clumsily edited, lessening the shock factor.
And though the relationship was between a white man and a black woman, the film didn't get preachy about it.
Modern romance has been beaten to a pulp, but even though the same conventions of romance movies exist in The Bodyguard, I'm not one of those people who hated it.
I don't think the actors could pull it off though.
Despite all this though audiences in 1992 loved it.
Whilst sunbathing topless, three men approach them in the hope to score a bit of random and casual sex and they do; even though two of them are old and downright hideous looking.
It gets worse though because one of the team says :  " This jobs easier than that twenty buck hoe I had in Las Vegas "  Yup there`s nothing more endearing to an audience than knowing one of the heroes has to pay for sex .
( even though you know it will all work out).
even though it is somewhat cheesy its not cheesy enough to bring down the episode.
I would definitely rank it as one of the better shows of the last season, though admittedly the bar is pretty low.
It's quite a different approach and frankly it becomes annoying after a while, though some of his lines are funny.
Surprisingly though, the producers just continued making new series.
it's not as good as resident evil but it's still a 10 i did not even get scared when it came on sci channel last week long advertisement though but it was still awesome though that was the best movie i saw that had zombies cause it had a lot of light and the dude who wrote it if your on here good job dude.Shaun of the dead was good to.la.la.la.Ad.Ad.Ad.brass monkey junkie that monkey monkey.
Even though the characters come and go, there are now new refreshing characters.
So in the end I'd say that the film is pretty graceful - gracefully written, acted, shot, though out - from the beginning to "Billy, you got what you deserved", and after that it turns into something else, another type of movie which we could call "the-plot-twist-contest-kind-of-movie".
This time, though, we are asked to sympathize with the heavy's side.
The reasons being that the story-line though thin, still manages to interest audiences due to its simple story-telling coupled with great visuals and music !
Other than that, though, this movie is an awesome romantic adventure.
The movie is badly directed though a good story and Vivek Oberoi cannot act.
Sushmita Sen as usual looked awesome though she wasn't needed in the movie, Vivek Oberoi..why can't you be a bit humble and try to do some acting??
the film started off well, though inspirations are too obvious.
As many have pointed out, it wouldn't seem as though Scorsese would be interested in an 19th century period piece.
Martin Scorsese is definatley one of the greatest directors of the past century and with this work, he proves (along with Kundun) that his verizons span beyond his classics like Mean Streets, Raging Bull and GoodFellas, though those works are some of the best in the American history of film.
Here in the Age of Innocence, Scorsese depicts (with the help of Edith Wharton's novel) of a time in New York when things when things were elegant, though also brutal in the deep.
The non-original music included some good pieces, even though `Alerte!
Martin Scorsese directed and, though a few of his trademark touches are in evidence, his ultra-restrained atmosphere (while appropriate for the period) proves disenchanting as entertainment, turning his three star leads (Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder) into suffering, swooning waxworks.
I did laugh though when one guy who was starting to "turn" tried munching on himself and a reverend also turning after being bitten, cut loose with a stream of profanity in the pulpit.
While they are others out there who hate Lifetime movies, I have to say I love the majority of them (there are exceptions though).
However, I did not find the characters to be as developed as I would have liked, so the film loses steam, even though it is a fairly short film, much less than ninety minutes.
Sadly, though, it is Mitchell that becomes the gorilla.
Goober from The Andy Griffith show did an imitation of Cary Grant where he just yells "Judy, Judy, Judy" again and again (even though Grant never actually uttered the lines)--this is about the same quality as Petrillo's performance.
That's where the superlatives end however, though as other reviewers have pointed out, this one merits viewing just because it's so goofy and entertaining.
Okay, if you can look past the fact that the "comedy team" (a term used very loosely here)is just a rip off of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, and the fact that Lugosi is only here because he was taking any and every role he was offered at this point, it's actually almost funny on it's own, even though most of the time I laughed at the parts that weren't supposed to be funny, and groaned at the parts that were trying to be funny, but were ultimately just embarrassing.
Jerry was not offended, though, he found the whole thing funny.
Duke Mitchell wasn't as good a Dean Martin, though, but a passable leading man and singer.
Even though that wasn't one of A&C's best it still was miles above this grade Z shlock.
On the flip side, though, this film has some elements that made it fun to watch in a very Mystery Science Theater 3000 kind of way.
After a while though he decides things are not going very well he decides to leaves.UUNTILL he saves a young girl from DEATH!
I have been trying to find this show in all the "Complete Directory to Prime Time and Network Shows," but failed to find it in there even though I had some of the stars right.
I really wish they would have made a few more episodes, though I doubt sincerely that it would have done well in the ratings.
This has a rather ambiguous ending though, but other than that it's pretty damn funny and while my review may not necessarily reflect that, that's because it's more one of those movies you have to really see to appreciate.
Their first though is, sell all their shares before the public finds out.
This movie shows the influence of 1932, the bottom year of the Depression, when many people though all businessmen were thieves and crooks who wrecked the world's economy.
There are some funny parts though.
That 70's show was a lot much too teenage (not that I didn't like it though) but the 80's one was soooo more adult!
I guessed the ending and later I found I was correct, all the 'laughs' I had seen and heard before and I sat there completely board as though I was staring at a blank screen.
Even though the movie is corny, it still sends a message that love will prevail.
Even though there are a lot of differences between "Guess Who" and "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner", I still see a resemblance.
Even though there were some serious things happening in the movie, basically the movie was very funny.
There's one ambient highlight, though, with hottie Maggie Q stepping in as starlet Gigi, an underutilized extra idling screen time chomping on entrees instead of enlightening Leo with her obvious allure.
Probably more than the above, though, Rice Rhapsody comes in handy for watching with your mom or sisters during one of those family afternoons we get once in a while.
One final note: I'm pretty sure that's Barbara Billingsley from "Leave it to Beaver" there towards the end, even though this is not listed as being among her films on this site.
I wonder why the Food Network never includes her in their specials though.
I NEVER saw or heard of nice women doing ANYTHING like this even though it was 10 years old when I saw it for the first time.
seems as though they only had one camera to work with..  ma mere, ma trash  Kristine
I expected a good adaptation of the book in this movie even though the rating was below 6.
J. Carrol Naish's informant/Judas character is the principle racial stereotype, though such stereotypes abound with an abundance of serape and sombrero clad extras mugging the camera throughout.
Despite not being particularly religious myself, I was sufficiently moved by Christianity's noble plight for survival, though I wasn't overly fond of the film's ultimate assertion that the lieutenant's hatred of religion stems directly from his secretly believing in God but being unwilling to admit it.
The opening sequence, in which The Fugitive returns to his former church, the light streaking through the windows as though God himself is reaching into the forsaken depths of the building, is spellbinding in its beauty.
While ArmendÃ¡riz is charismatic, and even slightly sympathetic, in his role of the antagonist, Henry Fonda largely looks awkward in the lead role (though you could argue that this uneasiness is integral to his character), and most of the other players Â perhaps due to a language barrier Â are similarly stilted.
It has been said that, of all the masterpieces he created with Henry Fonda and others, and there were many, The Fugitive was one of his all-time personal favorites, even though it was never a popular, nor critical success.
Allegories, and barely subtle Christ references abound in this movie, though never in a simple, nor trite manner.
Beautiful shots of horses riding, though.
It doesn't much matter though, as this really is fun visit to a theater.
Don't expect too much storyline though.
And being a fan of the original 1975 version I knew this was going to be a though bullet to take.
He and the other in-mates must fight to the death in a brutal style of fast paced explosive action If Ames wins though he is granted his freedom  Girls, Guns, Cars and Action.
It's fun, and it sure is better than being bored when your laptop can't get any internet (which is true, though I'll use their desktop sometimes).
For some reason the drivers are paired with sexy women to navigate, even though they have a pit crew to do that.
Nevertheless this is a great movie, the humor is spot on throughout the movie, though this is definitely no comedy.
this movie isn't my cup of tea.i couldn't watch it all,since i lost interest,but form what i saw,it just wasn't good.i just found it boring,with pretty bad acting,and a plot that is all over the place.it's a Russian made movie,the second i have seen now.the first one being Nightwatch.i didn't like that movie either.it also has a plot that doesn't make a lot of sense,at least in my opinion.anyway,Mirror Wars starts off promising enough,with some scenes of jet fighters doing maneuvers,which look pretty impressive.after that though,it's not so good.i wouldn't recommend it myself,but if you liked Nghtwatch,you might like this movie.for me,Mirror Wars is a 3/10
The disturbing part for me though was Forest Whittaker's performance as the father who go's berserk after the Vietnam War, losing all sense of morality for himself and his family.
Dennis Quaid is a decent match for her as a Capitol Hill lobbyist and juror who wants to help piece together the murder-mystery surrounding a female clerical assistant who had information regarding dirty doings in Washington, D.C. A fairly sophisticated yarn, though one cut straight from a formula.
Director Peter Yates does well at keeping the pace lively, though some of the early moments with Quaid are confusing and the script is weighty with contrivances and red herrings.
Even though she doesn't always believes in his innocence, she still goes after the real killer.
Interesting and exciting, though improbable.
Without the show's original voyeuristic shock value, ten of the twelve hours are unadulterated tedium (though I imagine a nifty 100-minute documentary could be culled from the footage).
Make no mistake, though, this is NOT the reality TV foisted on the public today.
hi,  This was my first experience of an Afghani Film, and even though my family is not too keen about the movies i watch, they all gathered and watched this, at various points expressing shock and emotion at what they saw.
On a different note possibly more hopeful, though family poverty, hardships of Afghan refugees and girl posing as boy to obtain work are still the ingredients, we have "Baran" 2001, another worthwhile filmic experience from Iranian filmmaker Majid Majidi ("Children of Heaven" and "Color of Paradise".)
And secondly, even though the movie mainly focuses on the miserable life of its characters in such surrealistic-to-the-western-eye settings, it does show tiny glimpses of the beauty of life: the lullaby that the grandma sings to put the little girl to sleep, or the joyful, threatening Espandi (the boy with the smoking bucket of wild rue [Epand in Persian or Dari]) who turns into a supporter of the little girl when she's overwhelmed by the aggressive, intrusive boys in the Taliban's Quranic school.
I am looking forward to watching remaining two films though they have not been finished yet.
Angelopoulos again makes the most of an intellectual way of cinema, which is though full of poetry and with the stain of compassion.
However, the acting is often painful to watch (with the exception of Carolyn Farina), and though there are no pyrotechnics, there's barely a plausible moment in the film.
I doubt, though, whether Pat Robertson would be likely to recommend his films, as they show a wide variety of human virtues and vices without simple black-and-white messages.
Making the foray into their world for us is Tom Townsend (Edward Clements), literally and figuratively a red-headed stepchild in this world of privilege, having little money (his big secret, which he guards carefully with the help of mass transit, is that he lives on the West Side) and a defensiveness about his place in high society he manifests by adopting the stance of a disapproving socialist, though in reality he is more than a little too shallow to feel anything that deeply.
Charlie's more of a preppie snob in his dislike for Tom, though as Tom trifles mildly with the affections of a woman in their circle, Audrey Rouget (Carolyn Farina), we understand Charlie's attitude.
Audrey and Tom stand out from the pack, in their earnestess and integrity, though it is assuredly Nick, (Christopher Eigeman) their figurehead and chief quip master who is the groups' un-elected leader.
This is a gentle subtle film that makes you feel as though you have spent an evening with charming, intelligent dinner companions.
There are some interesting 'ties' between the three, though not important to any of the individual stories by any means at all.
I though I could familiarize myself with Whit Stillman's oeuvre easily over the course of a long weekend.
Moreover, Tom and Audrey are really very wonderful people (though Tom has several faults).
The acting style though it may appear to be arch and affected actually captures quite well the voice patterns and intonations of those people it portrays.
The characters are flawed and doomed -- though, as one character notes, not doomed to failure, but just doomed to a normal, boring lifestyle -- and we can't help but love them for it.
The film is a light comedy-romance, though it is much more a comedy--with Beatrice sometimes hamming it up and other times doing a good job of playing this ditsy character.
Even though it strikes a different emotional chord from the comic character of most of the film, clear ground work has been laid for the ending; so it is not really unpredictable or a great plot twist.
She's even below the juvenile/character man (last billed featured player Franklin Pangborn, who's later lavender camp personality is still not locked in stone here, though his comic and dramatic talents are), but when she manages to get a handsome young drifter (little she knows!)
The film tries to conceal the killer's identity & to be fair it might work, unfortunately the version I saw revealed the killer on the back of the video box so I knew who it was all along, I doubt it would be that much of a surprise though.
Virgil makes for a pretty cool killer, the ending is unexpected and the gore, though cheap and occasionally of the squirt gun blood variety is fun to watch and ace in a couple of places.
Featuring Dirk Bogarde, Britain's prettiest closet gay, as yet another handsome heterosexual; he gives his usual competent turn as a cryptologist-par-excellence who is so obsessed with his craft that he can't even concentrate on sexy Susannah York (though we all know the real reason).
I was with a group of men in a foreign land though, not in England with a group of women.
Unfortunate, because the score, though minor Goldsmith, does have merit.
another thing i liked about this is i never got bored even though there isn't that much action it keeps at a good pace all the time.
The best though, was Chief Thunder Bird in his characterization of Sitting Bull; he had a couple of clever bits with the disappearing bed and the 'scalping' scene.
Despite this, I still am not complaining because I liked the film so much plus Miss Oakley is a rather mythic figure already and little impact on history (though she did a lot for women's rights--at least indirectly).
However, they did marry and they did travel with Buffalo Bill, though they first traveled with a different and less famous show.
Melvyn usually lost the girl to bigger name players though he was always a gentleman as he is here.
As it was, the primary plot elements were so unoriginal and timeworn that Â even though previously unfamiliar with either this Dickens original book or other filmed adaptations of it Â I found no suspense whatsoever to one of the two main plot lines to the story.
Paul McGann and Keeley Hawes, however, were even better Â though it must be confessed the beautifully modulated tones of Ms. Hawes seemed a long way from the docklands dialect her role suggested.
Supporting performances by such veteran character actors as Peter Vaughan and Pam Ferris (as the inimitable Boffins) brought richness and depth to material that otherwise would have been completely forgettable, though if I had to pick one actor who triumphed far and above the limitations inherent in his role it would be David Bradley (best known as Argus Filch from the "Harry Potter" canon) creating a memorably rascally Roger Riderhood.
Novel situation, novel location (beautiful images, even though the beach was re-modeled), novel plot, novel characters (all of whom are wildly different yet possible to sympathise with - except maybe for Bugs)... this film has everything in it that I find so desperately lacking in the average Hollywood pulp I'm forced to watch with friends.
Because of this, I didn't go and see it at the theatre, and have been ambivalent about renting the video, even though I like DiCaprio's work, and admired Danny Boyle's previous "Trainspotting".
I didn't even have to pay for it - but I still felt as though I had wasted 2 hours of my life.
Even though Dany Boyle has said that he is not very proud of The Beach I believe that he's made a gross error and misjudged his work because even after all these years The Beach still has a freshness to it that most films lose while they are still in the theaters.
Even though the fourth season was the worst, I was and remain convinced that a bad season of 24 is still better than a good season of any other show.
I think upon all the episodes i watched it seams it talk about American history and all the suffering that America is facing from their enemies were caused by their great white leaders i think a black head of state can resolve this issues.And also i think if there such movies yet going to be released in the future all the main supporting characters should survived at least seven seasons before they are ripped off.Even though 24 is a very nice movie and it tells a lot about what America is capable i think America is boasting its self to the world that no one can touch them and it can also attract more enemies around the world by also tempting them in so many ways.
Its hyper patriotic though.
The sexual implications in the narrative aren't ignored by Welles, though they are tip-toed around (probably due to the restrictions of 1968), and when Welles as the "old gentleman" finds himself the perfect boy to complete his plan, it's hard not to smirk when he calls the bottle-blonde "a fine looking sailor" and then offers him money.
Caruso is great fun, notably because of his caricatured acting (though he plays exactly what he is supposed to play, and he does it very well - his lines are so stupid... poor actor), but such obvious manipulation in filming is off-putting.
The couple appear to fall in love under these strange circumstances, though future relations seem to be highly doubtful.
Maybe he didn't because he was a perfectionist, even though the character portrayed is not a native French speaker   There are just two further points I should like to make that nobody else has touched on thus far:  First, the story for the script is from the pen of Danish raconteuse Karen Blixen, magnificently portrayed by Meryl Streep in "Out of Africa", who, Sheherezade-like, beguiled her lover and his friend with her fluent and fascinating tales.
They can not be indifferent about it though ...
Now I must admit, even though the violence is brutal and gory, the filmmakers don't glamorize it.
It draws you in with a mediocre beginning with a mediocre start (even though it includes Sam Rockwell, a fledgling actor back then who's moved onto greater things - Charlie's Angels not withstanding).
"Underground" is probably one of the shortest pieces, but it's very expressive - even though you're left to wonder at the end if anything illegal actually took place.
Though this is a poorly-done piece of amateur cinema, there is at least enough curiosity in seeing the presentation of the characters and other elements of the book, though you will likely be horribly disappointed with everything.
This film, though, has about the same artistic qualities as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Toolbox Murders."
When the film ended, though, it was interesting to note that, while the women in the audience stood and put on their cardis and coats, the blokes sat quite still for a minute or so :-) .  
Ben Webster is okay, though.
And the photography, though irritatingly grainy, is several steps removed from the billowing pastels of soft-core porn.
Certainly off to an interesting start, the film immediately gets one to think though that there is a promise of more like the hardcore footage shown right after the strange credit sequence.
Even though I live in Florida I like to support the Independent Films coming from da west coast.
Of course the men utter their comments without a lick of sincerity, though they do a nice job of faking it.
Anyway, though the movie has some good points (a nice setting, good actors such as Diego or CÃ¡mara), the final product is too weak, neither the dramatic part nor the comic one are that good.
After the two hours have passed, though, I was in love with this little gem!
A believable film about two people who are attracted to each other and because both spouses are gone- follow their hearts- though they are breaking vows.
Not only are they fun and challenging (not too hard, though), but they also are filled with jokes!
Even though the newcomers were initially half-heartedly allowed to participate in the long-standing National American Women's Suffrage Association, eventually they were forced out on their own.
As it is, by using a modern filming style and adding in lots of jokes that no one would ever think women of that time period would use (though I'm sure they DID say some pretty crazy things when men were out of hearing range), the writers and director managed to make a forgotten part of history rather hip.
I do warn you though, if you are not a fan of dry humor, this one's most likely not for you.
I remember this movie serial as a boy in the thirties,we would ask our mother's for a penny on a Wednesday after school,and line up at the local movie house along with hundreds of kids..mostly boys,it always promised fast action,the Mystery Squadron who had their hideout in a mountain cave,the Black Ace the leader always seemed as though he would never would be revealed,would provide the bad deeds,as the action heated up thousands of young feet would stomp on the balcony floor,it was a wonder that it never collapsed.it would build to a crescendo,THEN it would stop suddenly,everyone would hold their breath as the hero would be put in seemingly inescapable peril,NEXT WEEK...see the next thrilling chapter,we would pile outside still gripped in the spell and discus with actions what had taken place,we would then speculate as to how he was going to get out of this latest fix,Bob Steele,Tom Mix,Hoot Gibson,Buck Jones,Ken Maynard,our heroes,who never kissed a girl,in our games no one wanted to play the Black Ace.Happy innocent days.
"Puzzle" is already available in France (or at least in the French speaking part of Belgium; where I got it), even though the transfer to disc is fairly rudimentary and inconspicuous.
This fine Giallo tells an unusual story in an unusual way, and even though not much happens in the first half of the film, director Tessari manages to grip the viewer's attention from the beginning through stylish directing and really thrilling and creepy moments.
But, most importantly, even though the plot is a quite complicated net of strings that has to be lead together to the climax, the story remains plausible until the end, which isn't always the case in films of this genre.
Sega does it again (very hard for them to keep it up though).
It is unfortunate that Robin Johson did not pursue her career, I did recognize her in Miami Vice (she played a hooker former-hooker or something), though.
The girl who played Pamela was also convincing, though not as good as her co-star Robin Johnson, who was easily the best actress in the movie.
Even though the film was the non actor Brooklyn born Robin Johnson's debut she did as good a job playing the punk rock and incorrigible Nicky Marotta as any establish and polished actress could have possibly hoped to do.
The scenes with both Nicky and Pamala even though corny were touching in that they seemed to come straight from the heart not the script.
Here, though, her overbite is very noticeable and she seems unnecessarily thin.
This is a harmless though brainless film.
But I do give credit to the movie for having the guts to have an overweight semi-main character (even though she was very stereotyped), and especially that they showed her naked.
The anagram of Coleman to Maconel was a good touch though.
Cuthbert looks great as always but nice to see her in a movie where some acting is required, i would find it hard to criticise though as the film "the girl next door" is my favourite film of all time and Cuthbert can do no wrong.
His stabilizer though, found in the "victim", Vanessa (played amazingly well by Elisha Cuthbert), reminded me so much of Carrie-Ann Moss from Memento.
Memorable and worth seeing, though look for the Scott films directed by Budd Boetticher to see his best film or his final film that was directed by Sam Peckinpah.
The highlights Â most of the action seems to take place in and around one particular saloon, though in a montage we're shown that Anderson's 'protection' extends to many others in town Â include an energetic and brutal fistfight between the hero and a dim-witted giant (who subsequently joins forces with him), an astonishing shoot-out two-thirds of the way involving Scott and Pate which ends with the former left for dead, and the splendid extended climax.
Directed by B film genius Joseph H. Lewis, the film has originality, style, and quite an interesting premise, though the opportunities slip by.
Also similar to director Lewis' "Terror in a Texas Town" though thankfully not as goofy or campy.
Scott makes a good, twinkle-eyed loner hero and Angela Lansbury is quite attractive as his leggy showgirl love interest, (though she would begin playing mothers of grown children just a few years later) but their romance is rather obligatory and uninspired.
It is important though that battling remains in a larger cage too, there's no development here like in "Wild at heart".
This film is only let down by one minor complaint about the way it is filmed, with a Digial camera, though the shots are beautifully clear and so sharp they suck you in, there is moments of shaking and easy moving camera that at first I disliked, but it grows on you.
It is the protagonist's most prominent extension of herself in her own subconscious, though not necessarily the only one.
This is one of Power's very early films; he was only 22 when it was made, and though only a year older than he was, Young had been around since silent film days.
Inland Empire though, sheesh, I still have no clue what many of these scenes mean.
What is bad are the tiresome shots of darkened hallways, the constant entering into darkened rooms while the crappy electronic score kicks in (I guess we're supposed to feel a troubling eeriness in the air) in the background, and subtexted stage acts (in this case humans with fake rabbit heads) that don't enrich the story line, even though they are meant to thematize the breakdown in marital relations by showing how the language of married couples ceases to be communicative (gee, didn't T. S. Eliot already do this?).
It is also far from being a great film, (though it has at least one great sustained sequence - you figure), and at times it resembles nothing more than the out-takes from "Twin Peaks", "Blue Velvet" and "Mulholland Drive" though it lacks the cohesion of those films, (it's the most off-the-wall of any of Lynch's works and that includes "Eraserhead), and yet it is still extraordinary, unmistakeably the work of a unique and visionary artist and no-one, only Lynch, could have made it.
That is also a stand-alone (though unproduced) series that has been completely written for quite some time.
He is not a common filmmaker and I certainly do not believe he would just do things meaninglessly for the sake of being weird though many are quick to believe such a thing -- after all, attention spans and mental growth potential have been left in the womb by many a film-goer.
The confusion maybe never really stops, though I think the Lost Girl character may be the only "real" character because she is the only one watching what all the others play, she is the only one who plays it for real.
Because this inherently non-linear film (though it is more linear and plot driven than Eraserhead, Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway) offers one of many possible (possibly an infinite number of) linear interpretations - the film is/could be about acting and losing one's identity in a role.
If this particular interpretation were chosen, the free association between the roles played by the Polish actress/victim/perpetrator of the film "47" and that played by Dern's actress/victim/perpetrator in "Blue Skies" create a meta-text which, though unseen and unexplicated throughout the film, nevertheless identifies its subject as the disassociation and power of performance and creativity in the production of fiction/reality/drama.
For fellow admirers of Lynch: IMO, This is a more coherent film than Eraserhead, a more upbeat and enjoyable film than Lost Highway, a less commercial film than Mulholland Drive (though it does bear some thematic resemblances largely because both films are overt self-referential interpretations of American media culture).
The film "technically" has no US distributor, though it has many European ones and the French Studio Canal signed on early at the stage when DL said he was using DV and didn't know what he was doing.
If this is tupac's legacy i feel sorry for him, well done Biggie for shooting him (allegedly) (though we all know its true).
It is not a mystery to be solved, as Mulholland Dr. was (though that film never will be solved either).
I would recommend that you see it in a theater though, as it could never have the same impact anywhere else.
"My Favorite Year" was though.
I understand that the O'Toole character was based on Errol Flynn, even though he had died before this movie supposedly is set.
I really felt like I was watching a film from the classic era Â not just because of the high quality of the script and the actors, but because this film knows how to present an innocent kind of charm in a sophisticated way; it's a far cry from the juvenile (though occasionally hilarious) films being pumped out of the teenage movie factory that Hollywood became in the 1980s.
Richard Benjiman show great skill as a director even though this one of his earliest films.
It was sad, though, to see Selma Diamond, with that cigarette dangling out of her mouth, knowing that within 3 years, her smoking would turn her into the "Late Selma Diamoind" as lung cancer would claim yet another life.
He had a certain charm and could get away with it, a lot though not the way O'Toole does.
Needless to say every Saturday I was glued to the TV watching "Your Show of Shows" Even though I was at an age when I should have been out chasing around.
This was a very funny comedy set in the New York City of 1954-55, and involving the likes of three or four figures that normally did not have much in common, though three were in the entertainment field, and they would occasionally (or almost occasionally) work together.
It has given me many hours of pleasure though.
I didn't like Larry that much though.
I do however have a place in my heart for this film, even though the script was downright terrible, some moments in this film are just a must to commit to memory and are undeniably funny.
though it's not to say it's not a hilariously entertaining trip.
There are numerous animation techniques mixed together, loads of standard anime exaggeration (no manga though), psychedelic trips, serious issues and silly sarcastic humor.
The plot contains too many loopholes to worry about it, and the humour - though funny at times - is not well executed.
The only person in this film who could act was poor Joe Flaherty (his work in "SCTV" and "Freaks & Geeks" would testify to this)--and how he got stuck in this film is anyone's guess, though if you check his career, he has made some interesting decisions as far as the projects he took.
The other son hates snowboarders and will do anything to get rid of them--even though this makes zero economic sense.
This film is indeed about more than 'plot', though it hangs on the path of a man who is shown going about his typical, elliptical life in London, where he seems to be a holed-up DJ for some obscure station.
After a time, he begins a car journey to Bristol in search of 'answers' regarding the unexplained death of his brother; which is possibly, though never definitively, linked with a pornographic movie racket - reported in radio news bulletins - in the West Country.
I could make few spoilers that would seem significant, though points do jab out at you; particularly in the sense that expected explanation or fruition occasionally seem on the cards.
He is a guide, but rightfully not one we are encouraged to easily identify with; though at times, I certainly can.
During all this, though, he is building a bomb using his skills as a clock maker, and awaiting Hitler's arrival to the Beer Hall (Munich), -where the story is set.
The movie is well directed, too, giving it a polished look and feel that a lot of HK moves don't have (for the past several years it seems they've been doing better, though).
So here you go: Two movies, same year, same kind of productions (though DEATH BY DIALOGUE does look like it had a healthier budget than TEEN VAMP), same kind of target audience, same medium of home video oriented productions and they could not have turned out more differently if they had been aware of each other & made a point to be different.
The only gripe is that even though the create-a-spell system was interesting concept, but the characters had no special abillities of their own.
Two of the film's stars impressed me the most though.
As the anecdote was explicitly treated as Cooper's own version of events, I see little "dishonesty" in Hitchcock's clever manipulation of the audience, and the final twist certainly succeeded in taking me by surprise Â though I probably should have noticed something amiss when the romance between Eve and Smith began to develop.
It might be the only film where Hitch does 2 Cameos - though one is so subtle that it is hard to catch while the other is very obvious.
Wyman is very good, though she doesn't use an English accent.
As Doris, though, she has a very serviceable Cockney.
And though Dietrich's acting seems unconvincing at firstÂshe's best as a cool and implacable diva, not a distraught widowÂwhen you learn that the first scene was a lie, everything truly falls into place.
I rather enjoyed it though.
Even though it's not in the same league as "Psycho" or "Rear Window", it's still an extremely delightful piece of film making.
Even mediocre Hitchcock is better than most movies ever get, though.
Great use of silent sequences, close ups, slow motion, black humor, and mood lighting, Hitch's most underrated talkie (Easy Virtue is is most underrated silent film), this murder mystery offers all kinds of plot twists and sly humor even though you know the outcome long before it unspools.
If you want to see something that's actually an interesting movie, though Hollywood, see 'The Vikings' or for something more lighthearted 'The Longships'.
Some warnings though:   1.
The main characters are likable, the viewer can relate to them within a few minutes, even though only very basic informations concerning their backgrounds are given.
Richard Chamberlain's portrayal of an inattentive, abusive husband is totally unconvincing, though the real fault is in the writing.
And then there's Joseph Cotton looking as though he belongs on a slab in the morgue.
The fragmented plot and the noisy editing style seemed to be very much on purpose, and though I can enjoy non-linear narrative (e.g., Tarantino), the style seemed to be the thing director wanted to "say".
It was as though the character in Petulia got transferred to New York, still lost but still the good doctor.
----SPOILERS INCLUDED---- not that it matters for such a horrible film, though...
Worth a look if it's your scene though.
I've never wanted to sleep at the cinema before, but this time I actually longed to close my eyes and take a nap (I didn't, though).
This does not change the fact that it is trafficking too heavily in stereotypes and Hallmark staples such as "Don't ever let anybody tell you that you can't do something" (yes, Will Smith actually says this at one point) or that it rigorously rubs Chris' misery in our faces in every step of the way, even though we clearly got the gist of his miserable conditions early on in the film.
Chris is good at numbers though, and can solve a Rubik Cube with astounding ease; so he applies for an internship at Dean Witter.
Make no mistake though; for the feel-good genre, The Pursuit of Happiness is a brutal, sometimes cruel entry.
When i got home that night and went to sleep i imagined what it must have been like for him and i felt as though i was a part of this mans life and thats what made the film so great.
When things went bad you felt as though you wanted to help.
It is the truth, though.
I will say though, movies like these are terribly necessary because without them we'd never appreciate good films.
The "surprise" at the end isn't terribly original Â though it pays to remember that this film was shot in 2001 and spent three-and-a-half years in troublesome post-production before being released, so it's kind of coming in after its time.
Based on historical accounts that I've read, this movie is very faithful to details and does not necessarily portray the Earps in the most sympathetic light, though they are definitely the protagonists here.
The biggest difference though is in the writing.
And though today we associate him most strongly with that event, it did not define him.
It reminds me thus of the greatest of character portrayals, Raging Bull--though I'm sure the parallel isn't obvious.
I must admit though that it had a good tag line but that's about it.
But the rail yard remains the same, though non functional for the last 20 years.
Even though I feel they could have taken the shock value just a tad further.
He lives in a squalid flat with his wife and deformed baby (which looks like a cross between E.T and the baby from Eraserhead, though not nearly as believable).
Not even though it is cheap and rough-made but BECAUSE of it.
Still that doesn't make a good movie though!
We have plenty of drug dealers making a living though, and lots of desperate people out there wandering the streets through landscapes that are depressing and barren.
It's never clear if she's totally clueless or remarkably tolerant of her husband's extramarital liaisons, though the film's ending points toward the latter.)
Even though he is a married man, he has no qualms having sex with various female students.
Most of the girls who applied in the roles of high school alumni were aspiring actresses, though some were local students who merely found the whole thing amusing."
The viewer will note that though the theme and philosophy seem deviant by today's standards, there is almost no vulgar language used in the film.
There is also some great support by Spanish bit players (the Spanish sounds at times a bit shaky, though Â but what else can you expect in Cardiff?).
Worst of all, though, is the climax as a deranged and wounded McDowell turns up at the cabin (after having miraculously survived an avalanche he caused himself!)
All the dead woman had to do was change her will while she was alive   Story two ) A bunch of feminist " lesbian " students find the going tough when their college commitee turn against them though for one of them it leads to a happy ending .
THE MECHANIK has a bare-bones story - fairly big on the clichÃ©s, I might add, though thankfully not including a tired re-found love angle - but it's put together with a consistent style (you'll have to dig the contemporary look & editing, though) and the cinematography looks fine, using faded, stained colors with hard contrasts.
And, if you watched them as they originally aired, you had to watch them in five minute increments for Volume One and 20 minute increments for Volume Two, which could throw you off in terms of the pacing (though, again, I thought they did it very, very well and that the way the chapters aired made perfect sense).
No match for the real thing, though.
Trust me, though, you can not sit through every episode.
The effects are very bad, even though there is some gore, and the story is stupid.
I have been looking for years for this movie, when I did find it, I almost peed my pants (I didn't though, just using as a reference for my extreme excitement).
It's slowly declining nowadays, though, I'm afraid.
After all though, it's expected from this sort of film so it's not a big problem.
I kind of knew Zohan would be bad inside but I still wanted to see it, I loved Little Nicky even though critics trashed that.
I don't know if none-Israeli's would find half the jokes funny though.
With that said though, Sandler may have inadvertently found a point of agreement for Israelis and Palestinians.
But though the movie may have lacked focus, I couldn't help but have fun with it.
And this one also has Carol Lynley and Anne Lockhart in it (though practically as extras).
SPOILER ALERT: If you're wishing to point out dopey things about the film (though of course EVERYTHING is stupid), the ghostly decomposed body of the murder victim couldn't have decomposed, as it was sealed in concrete.
The noise that the ghost makes (sounding something like a kid doing an impression of a frog) is creepy at first, but it's also massively overused and soon becomes old - though it may well have been an inspiration to the noise that the ghost in 'The Grudge' makes.
But the ending was good though: Bus of Death, hÃ¨hÃ¨hÃ¨hÃ¨...
Some of the disaster sequences are exquisite though, especially the plane crash and the final disaster.
This is OK for the kiddies, though it is rather violent.
Nicolas Cage pulls off one of his best performances in years, and even though a lot of what he does ends up being futile, I really felt for all the characters.
Regardless of what I though of the movie overall, nearly 24 hrs later and the movie is still with me.
Cage is an MIT professor, though we never learn what type we can only assume astrophysics.
The most annoying thing though was the plot - it didn't make any sense.
When I saw that I just had to see it, even though I did get nightmares after doing so.
Part of its attraction when I was growing up, I think... To give the impression that only kids will enjoy it is false though.
The beginning is really hard to watch, even though I like indie movies, with a lack of background music, but it is just that the character Keane is extremely unappealing in his madness, or supposed madness.
Seriously though, I should be ashamed of myself for not having ever seen this movie for so long.
When the film ended (with incredible abruptness) a man in the row in front of us let out a large gasp as though someone had just punched him.
Still another was surprised at how natural and unscripted the movie seemed Â as though we were really sharing this man's reality, especially the scenes between Keane and the little girl.
We feel sad because even though we already knew it, we know this little girl can't save him, she can't help him.
Even though it's a nonsequitur I must add that this female otaku thinks Inuyasha's older brother, Sesshyomaru, is a real babe.
After watching the Brooklynite Jamie Hector play out his part as the strong and silent Marlo opposite Wood Harris in The Wire, It was the straw that broke the camel's back in making me consider this movie even though I was pretty sold on the title itself.
You don't have to be a fan of Fresh or Superfly (though both are good movies) to enjoy this movie.
Probably all a sick coincidence, though.
The acting isn't terrible, though some is cringe worthy.
The first question that comes to mind though is who the hell came up with the idea.
Even though the point of the movie was to have shocking plot twists by referencing various pop culture ideas and movies, the movie was completely predictable at all times.
Even though the little critters are evil, they are very likeable and the people who created them did a fantastic job in designing them.
On the whole, though, 98% of this movie is just mind-numbingly bad.
Devlin though, has no producing credits here, he plays future computer nerd Terry, the main assistant to the film's hero, Michael Pare.
The cast is not extra ordinary, which makes it also feel so fun to watch, but nevertheless, the cast is still great, though the character of Billy wasn't the best they could have chosen, but like I said, that's part of the fun of it all.
Turns out though that Moon 44 is a piece of dreary trash.
I consider the cinematography above average in Moon 44 because the director, even though on a short budget was able to create some neat scenery, of futuristic earth, space ships, fighter planes, the base itself and etc.
Now, I though this may sound crazy, but I have to be able to get into a movie to enjoy it, like I enjoyed Blade Runner because of the cinematography.
Even though Moon 44 was done in a foreign country and on a tight budget, I consider Moon 44 to be one of my Sci-Fi favorite flicks.
The main worse parts for me, though the whole movie can just be summed up as a whole "worse part", were the crassness and crudity of it which I found completely unbelievable.
And though I want to see him in a more serious role than those he has been playing lately, this film was actually good.
Even though it's an average romantic comedy, it stands better than a lot of others because it uses a different concept.
As for the movie, if you like this sort of thing give it a shot, though I'd wait for cable.
Sorry all, but even though I overall LOVED the movie the author MISSED on the history.
A simple average, though does not explain the high level of overall enjoyment from the work of fiction.
And this is especially true for Ah Tu, even though he's with someone who resembles, and not with the actual person.
If you sit back, though, and view these scenes as being magical realism, you can enjoy the visuals and the characters and the plot.
I did enjoy this game mildly, though; the graphics were okay, and the boss fights weren't all too bad.
Highly amusing though a long way from the classics that starred Porky Pig, Daffy Duck, Bugs Bunny, etc.
Even though the special effects are cheesy (as expected with this budget), the cinematography is great, good angles, a clear effort to create a "bigger"looking picture, with scenes that look so close to film that one forgets we are seeing a DV 24p project.
I saw the cover and though this would be your typical slasher low budget flick (the kind I love to watch).
I rented this DVD last night and actually really enjoyed it.It was a good realistic movie with a believable plot and real ordinary looking people.Even though it's a horror,I haven't laughed so hard in my life.
Even though the humor was dark and cruel,it was hysterically funny.For a movie made on a very low budget,this was impressive.It began with a gory scene in a thunderstorm and then begins years later.The actor that played Monty was perfectly cast.I loved it at the end when he got back at his tormentors since they sure had it coming!
For the most part though they failed to live up to the energy and fun of this movie.
Even though the Gremlins do kill, this movie never gets as dark as some of the copycats, or too goofy like some of them do.
Ultimately though it is the performance of Diane Goldner, the real heroin of both this film and the TV show, that made this the first big hit of "Project Green Light" and I eagerly await her return... in the up coming "Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds" (still in production) as the Biker Queen this time instead of the Harley Mom in "Feast"(2005).
I thought Feast was a satisfying film.I will say I was just a little disappointed, because I was expecting a tad bit more, but still, it was very enjoyable, and even though at some parts I felt as if they overdid some stuff a bit, it contained cool action scenes, and I believe really lovable characters.Also, they kind of throw you off guard, and do some of the things that you least expect, such as how they killed of Heroine, which when I thought since she was like, one of the most important characters of the story, they would've kept her alive, and also at the part where one of the creatures devours that child, I wasn't expecting that either, which I believe was clever that they were able to do that.There was even pretty laughable comedy, which one of the best mixes of genre is Horror/Comedy, and like I said before, I was really into the characters, like the old woman and Tuffy were some of my favorites in Feast.This was a good movie, and I think it has a pretty reasonable rating, so I have nothing further to say, except that if you absolutely flat out hated this movie, you DEFINITELY need to watch it again, and maybe you'll see the error of your ways.
Even though there are no explanation to them, it still does not matter, as the movie just circles around the characters, and their battle to survive... which in fact never gets boring.
'The Descent' managed to show the monster's faces and they were pretty ugly.In this movie, You can only see their whole face either near the end of the middle or in the end.I must admit that I had some fun with this movie.I will plan on seeing the sequels even though they did not get as good reviews as this one.
If you're trying to prolong going to get that root canal done but have ran out of other things to procrastinate with though, this is less painful.
It's not anything to see if you're looking for a lift, though.
It is repeatedly asserted that this is a "bleak" vision, as though that bleakness were itself sufficient reason to reject it.
It is as though in the mind-set of this film-maker and his intended audience the mere undesirability of a thing is sufficient reason for us to regard it as not true!
I wasn't a huge fan of the sequel, even though I have it in my DVD collection right next to the original.
My own Blog at http://freedemocrat.blogspot.com/ follows many of these intellectual threads and offers a vision of an alternative to the Neocon Ideology that is not the classic "liberal" ideology though most progressive ideals end up in the results.
The performances are realistic, the action and thrills are intense, and, even though the budget is obviously very small, the director does a great job of keeping the aliens out of view.
Even though the special effect monsters steal the show, the acting by the human actors is very good too.
Even though I recognized him the show still was very freaky and scared me so bad that I had trouble falling asleep that night.
A fairly good watch, Every seems rather realistic, The fact the movie looks as though seen through a crappy camera makes it seem life-like.
I first watched this around 5 years ago at 11pm with the lights off and a storm outside, Scary no?, Thus making me lose 2 nights sleep...The ways the Aliens were conveyed were okay, and the "powers" they had were a tad far-fetched but still a great movie to watch alone and in the dark, the bad thing though is if you watch it for a second time all the scary moments just aren't there leaving you to sell it or watch as your friends are scared by it just to play small jokes on them for a day or two(worked with my brother, so meh).
The effects (though cheap) are effective in that they get the job done.
If you were watching her carefully, you would have seen her drawing aliens, even though she never saw them (correct me if I am wrong, as I said I missed the first 20 minutes).
When I was about 11 years old, at the time of Blair Witch came (not being able to see it though), I was drawn into the hype as I didn't fully understand how the world worked.
Genuinely scary and gripping from start till end, though still requesting more footage, this film gets a 9/10.
Perhaps it is because of this that I found the film so convincing, but it is well worth watching even though you have seen that it is not a record of an actual alien abduction.
You would be so, SO wrong to assume that though.
Greater problems lie ahead, though, as Enterprise crew members are found dead.
The answer is equally basic, but not less relevant for that: the leading trio of Kirk, Spock and McCoy (even though they weren't acknowledged in that way until the start of Season 2: up to that point, only Shatner and Nimoy are credited in the title sequence; everyone else is listed in the closing credits).
The very first episode of the original Trek series to air, though this was the 6th one filmed.
The execs wanted to start things with a 'monster-of-the-week' mentality, but though the creature in this one is responsible for a number of crew deaths, it's more to be pitied than reviled by the end of the episode.
And the human equation is delineated in McCoy's story in this one: he's reunited with his old girlfriend, so he's charmingly nervous as all hell, but in quick order, finds out she's been dead and her imitator must be killed, even though she's the last of her kind.
Even though I knew every joke, they were still great.
While this film is not as sleazy as SLAVES IN BONDAGE or GAMBLING WITH SOULS, two earlier films that featured star Wheeler Oakman as a pimp, ESCORT GIRL is slickly made and well-acted by a wonderful cast, and while it doesn't "show anything", it does have a seedy, dirty feel to it, even though it's not unlike a studio-bound, low-budget Grand National crime drama.
So it's a film told in flashback, even though it's not a process we're aware of until towards the end.
Meanwhile there are other flashbacks too, notably those which reveal the central characters having both been victims of childhood sexual abuse - a process though which presumably has left West with a sense of injustice that's his wellspring of rage against the world.
This movie has a realistic, thanks to the way its acted, aura about it, though is it supposed to be an in your face, over the top comedy.
West, going nowhere fast, Art unfortunately, nowhere ever, and Nancy, though being a symbol of true unbridled love, her synthetic limitations and tragic circumstances leads her down the same dead-end road as her male co-stars.
In fact, I liked a lot more how the conflict of multiple personalities is handled on this movie; the ending, actually, made a bit more sense (though it would be a toss-up to say this film is better than Fight Club).
But still, It aired again a little while later and even though it was my second time seeing it, it was still very funny.
Forget that though, and just enjoy the fact that it did, because moments of sunshine are often all too rare, a fact emphasized throughout this film.
In many scenes, the faces are digitized human faces applied to spider-like drawings--though many of the minor characters are simply animated.
He was only 49 at the time, despite looking much older than that though.
Even though he didn't live to see his 50th birthday, he still looked like someone my father would have played bridge and drank gin with at the Tarratine Club in Bangor, Maine in the mid-70's.
Boy spends the run up to the wedding trying to win the heart of the girl, even though she thinks he's an idiot.
Be warned though, I can imagine it has probably dated quite badly.
Very cute and very funny film, in French with English subtitles, though I doubt any of the females will be reading them, since the "visuals" in this movie are not to be missed.
Falk reassures him though that he was never a suspect.
Cons: Sometimes the plots can be derivative or questionable, never really gets edgy, characters, though well drawn, never get out of place.
Humour though, i think is the key to ncis's success.
I will miss the playful interactions between Tony and Caitlin though.
Kate Todd (Sasha Alexander), killed in the Season 2 Finale, who came from Secret Service, and made a point of bringing it up whenever the occasion presented itself, and came off as quite the uptight girl; all in all, the weakest character in the show, though her witty 'Hepburn-Tracy' rapid-fire dialogues with DiNozzo were great, and she had with him the strongest hetero almost-text this side of Gil Grissom and Catherine Willows.
He has proved his valor, though, time and time again.
None of the gang members bother them, even though they've been threatening others.
The film tries to conceal the killer's identity & to be fair it might work, unfortunately the version I saw revealed the killer on the back of the video box so I knew who it was all along, I doubt it would be that much of a surprise though.
Virgil makes for a pretty cool killer, the ending is unexpected and the gore, though cheap and occasionally of the squirt gun blood variety is fun to watch and ace in a couple of places.
Overall, though, it's quite well done.
I am really disappointed the dvd had absolutely no special features though.
YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES   Aspect ratio: 1.85:1  Sound format: 6-track Dolby Stereo  (35mm and 70mm release prints)  In Victorian London, the teenage Sherlock Holmes (Nicholas Rowe) and John Watson (Alan Cox) are intrigued by a series of apparently unrelated 'suicides' which lead them to a murderous Egyptian cult operating in the bowels of the city...  Enjoyable - though inconsequential - reimagining of Holmes' teenage years, which blends old-fashioned British melodrama with the demands of a US summer blockbuster.
Lots of naughty language and nudity, though!
The characters are equally ill-developed(though this time, I *could* tell them apart... they were easier to tell from each other, however, so maybe I wasn't the only one who couldn't tell those in the first apart?).
Unfortunately the newcomers aren't the hardy breed though, and they fall one by one.
Unfortunately the newcomers aren't the hardy breed though, and they fall one by one.
I did prefer it though to the original.
EVIL DEAD 2: DEAD BY DAWN is really a re-telling of the same events from the first story, but in this case, only Ash and Linda (Bruce Campbell and Denise Bexler) come to the cabin and less than 10 minutes into the movie he has played a recording from a professor who mouths the infamous lines from the Necronomicon and unwittingly brought his girlfriend to an untimely death, though she herself becomes re-animated and returns to torment him as a severed head and a body with a chainsaw in its hands who unwittingly slices itself in two.
Perhaps the very best of the, "Alfred Hitchcock Hour," series, the ending has a lasting impact; even though I haven't seen it in years.
But if you have half-a-brain then you're probably anticipating that the box is exactly what it turns out to be: bull that hopes to get people to watch it even though it's vintage Bergman.
He keeps sleeping with his other fiancÃ© without breaking it off when he starts sleeping with Anna, but neither of them can really hold it against him because apparently (though I don't know why) he's such a good person.
Also he gives Anna's brother his own actual first name, "Ernst," though I have no clue what that signifies.
Many specific scenes, like a very harsh (though always under the surface) scene between Karin and Henrik, when she tells him point blank to leave and never come back to see Anna, or when Anna is told after the death of her father Johan (Max Von Sydow, always great to see him even in limited time) about how she destroyed a letter she found that she meant to sent to Henrik.
And with the ending, it's satisfying, in a catharsis way though it's not as great, or even perfect, an ending it could have been had a certain decision been made on Henrik's part when he sees Anna outside.
Technically though, the film is excellent.
There is something that could be said about Hrithik's physical presence in the film though.
There are a couple of nice action set pieces ranging from full scale war with the clashing of two opposing sides (the elephants were a great bonus, trust me), to a duel which turns out to be a courtship ritual, something not new since both Hrithik and Aishwarya challenged each other before (though on the basketball court), with the latter quite well versed in swordplay given her earlier role in The Last Legion, and one featuring what I thought took a leaf out of the battle between Hector and Achilles in Troy.
Instead an unknown actor with a commanding presence would have better suited this role...I think Hrithik would be more suited to play the part of Jehangir, in a historic movie, as Jehangir was known to be a typical ladies man...  2) Aishwarya Rai as a Rajput princess is a joke...same as Hrithik, she lacks the stature to play such a part...she is pure eye candy...her voice is weak & she sounds absurd delivering her lines...my choice to play this part would have been Sushmita Sen...  3) The plot of this movie is 2/3rds pure fantasy...Akbar did not have a wife by the name of Jodha...he married a Rajput princess called Hira Kunwar, who promptly converted to Islam and was called Mariam-ul-zamani...she was one of Akbar's many wives and bore him his heir apparent Jehangir...  4) It is not evident whether the director meant for this film to be a love saga or a political drama...too many sub-plots spring out throughout the length of the movie, but get resolved quickly & conveniently...it seems the director wanted to pack in as much masala as possible, culminating in an unnecessary fight scene...  5) Akbar's birth name was Badruddin Mohammed Akbar, after his grandfather Shaikh Ali Akbar and "Akbar" was not a title conferred on him...  5) Akbar was better known as a master strategian & shrewd administrator, not for his chiseled physique...he was also not monogamous as is depicted in the movie, but like other emperors of his time had innumerable wives & concubines...though he has been painted as being broad-minded & liberal as compared to other Mughals, Akbar was far from the benign & forgiving monarch portrayed here...he was responsible for slaughtering thousands of men, women & children, destroying hundreds of temples & ransacking scores of towns & villages...finally no Indian emperor would be fool hardy enough to challenge his adversary to single combat & stake his entire kingdom on the outcome of the fight...  6) The battle scenes are evidently inspired by (read - copied from) Hollywood movies such as Troy & Alexander...however after watching the realistic, gruesome wars depicted in the latter, these appear as tame, watered down versions...the climatic confrontation in this movie reminds too much of the awe-inspiring stand off between Hector & Achilles in Troy...
Hrithik Roshan puts up what is probably his best performance as Akbar, though he is hindered by the sheer volume of activity making up the plot: an absent queen mother, sinister foster mother, devious brothers, and, above all, a reluctant wife, all demand his attention.
The old fashioned Urdu recitations are especially difficult to ascertain, though sometimes the subtitles only further your confusion.
Jodha-Akbar is a motley of exceptional love,Terrific Action,Soulful music and splendid cinematography.It is one of the most uncommon films and a must see one if you want to witness something special.The film got combative stunts and it has everything to please everyone.But on the other side,the film is slow and lengthy.The first half of the film lasts more than 2 hrs yet the twists and turns will glue the audience to the cinema.Hrithik was awesome as Akbar and Aishwarya was majestic as Jodha.Direction was at the best.Ashutosh proved yet another blockbuster which falls in the same line of Lagaan and Swades.May be he need to concentrate on the duration of the film by chopping off few scenes.Jodha Akbar is basically a love story instead of calling it as a War based film.The film lacks pace and slow narration of few scenes and the frequent usage of Urdu language made the audience ambiguous and also boring.But at the other end,even though the film lasts for more than 3.30 min,it is gripping enough and very much bearable.The Director need to edit the film and make it as a 3 hrs film so that the audience will like this film even more.The huge star-cast of Hrithik-Ash playing as Akbar and Jodha might have evoked a lot of curiosity among the audience before the release but i must admit the film almost lived up to the expectations.The love part was dealt exceptionally well and it is the forte for the film.The film depicted the Legacy of Akbar.The film also shown that Akbar did lot good for Hindus.
Rehman, is pleasant and suits the genre movie and the songs, though a few, are good as well and especially the wedding night song.
The stunts and the fight sequences, which are well timed, and though they look dangerous at times, are worthwhile watching.
Conclusion: This movie has all the ingredients to become a classic, epic movie in the future, even though it is three and a half hours in duration.
The film began on a very slow and rather boring note though Amitabh Bachchan's powerful role as the narrator was worth appreciating.
All in all a good movie and among best of the several (though not all) of Â«Les Trois MousquetairesÂ» that I have seen so far.
In fact though I doubt that people from this country have even heard of this movie.
This movie follows the phrase "Lets just suppose"... A terrific family film, though specific scenes could be frightening for very young children.
The films, which can be viewed in any order (though chronologically is probably better than numerically) range from Cremaster 1 (most 'ascended' or undifferentiated state) to Cremaster 5 (most 'descended').
The pacing though was student film like, the information presented ambiguous and thus a great topic executed so inadequately that it became unbearable.
The performances are mostly good, though some of the smaller roles seem very stiff, as though he was using non-actors.
The ending though is intense, the final scenes with the girl and the flashing torch really did get to me, it was one of these scenes I'll bring up when I'm asked about the creepiest moments in cinema.
It does feel as though she's added for a simple plot vehicle, this too can be said for the equally strong performance of Baker, another missed performance.
Little Dakota Fanning ,who plays Emily,is absolutely awesome in this film and i will be watching her career closely in the future and though this is the sort of role Robert DE Niro,the dad,could play in his sleep,he still puts in a great though slightly muted performance.
The ending though a bit labored does put all the pieces of the puzzle together in just who Charlie is and what's the reason for his actions.
Have you ever turned on the TV and found that there was a film on and even though you've missed the first twenty minutes you decide to keep watching?
The main reason I remember this film to this very day, even though I have not seen it since today, is that I fell totally in love with Sophie Ward.
Even though he did not direct it, the film has his signature all over it.
Then there's Pryor as Piano Man as we see many of his humorous moments, with or without Diana, bring some needed levity whenever things get heavy though there's some good drama concerning him at the end.
She also doesn't exactly resemble Holiday, who was rather plump early on, but she just so commands the screen...amazing how few films she has ultimately made, though the specter of Dorothy Dandridge looms large.
Ross gets plenty of opportunities to sing and though she really doesn't sound anything like Holliday did, she does capture the spirit of this tragic songbird.
Even though she did not win, we are still left with a performance of depth, passion and layers that could only be described as magnificent in an experienced actress.
However, Joan is aware of John's way of living and she manages to trick him into marrying her, even though she does not love him and he has the exact same feelings towards her.
Actually by 1933, her career had begun its decline (though she worked on and off until 1965).
Stephenson acts as though he is furious, and wants to know the intentions of both Powell and Harding: how do they feel about each other, and will they marry or not?
Harding pawns a ring for $500.00 (Brown is upset that the pawnbroker did not pay her the full value of the ring - as though a pawnbroker would!).
Joan is meanwhile busy pressing her husband to work on making his business a success and give up the polo (even though he's not very ambitious and has stated he prefers the life of leisure).
Everyone in this movie is fabulously wealthy by the standards of the day, even though their interests are under pressure from the economic turbulence of 1931-1932.
Instead, he was a rich playboy who was a little less likable, though he was honest enough to tell his girlfriend (plaed by Ann Harding) that he wanted to be a playboy and didn't want deep commitment.
Ms. Harding, though a nice person, was determined to marry him so she concocts a plan to trick him into feeling he must marry her.
She is successful, though afterwards her victory seems very hollow.
It really appeals to younger mystery fans, even though it is rated PG-13, for violence.
In the end, it is not something worth going out of your way to see though.
Jiro Manio's character (as Magnifico) is one of the amazing characters on this film even though his character is the lead of this film.
I'd say, Jiro Manio - Even though his a kid, he has played a very tough roll on this film but he act very awesome and his took parts very well.
I'd say, this movie is a 10/10 even though it's a really sad film to watch.
Could be veteran (though nonetheless underrated) director Maryo J. delos Reyes' most heartwarming, uplifting film.
This was one of the best films I have seen in quite some time.It was very easy to get caught up in the story.The children captured my heart,even though at times they were dreadful little monsters.
This is a great family movie, though toddlers will be bored...older children will better understand the humor.
After the mayhem is over though, a very happy ending is taking place.
The movie wants us to believe that the woman he really ought to marry is his young scullery maid (Kelly MacDonald) even though the chemistry between the two is somewhat less than bristling.
Even though she used her "magic" to get desired results from the children, all one had to do was look into her eyes and see the genuine compassion she felt for the children.
The score, by-the-books though it may be, is perfect and bodes well for Doyle's work on the new Harry Potter movie.
For one, the writing and directing is very solid, and it manages for the most part to avoid many sci-fi cliches, though not all of them.
Even in the most disjointed of marriages (such as the second of my two marriages) there is generally some sort of attachment between the two even though they may both be in the divorce court!
Although I understand she now lives in Switzerland, I have often thought that even though I am in my 50's and gave up the thought of acting professionally years ago, it would be great if she still lived in Hollywood and I was able contact her.
Still though it's a classy film, beautifully filmed and with a truly epic and emotive score by Philippe Sarde.
I love Jean Gabin, though i must confess, i've only seen him play the old man.
The film though shows how tricky things may be.
The blind guy is creepy, though.
One of the big pluses here is that the plight of the low-income elderly is shown in a grim, though very realistic and plausible, light.
I kinda hated Ormond though, I don't see why she had to speak in that awful accent.
I gave it a 7 because even though it lacks in some departments some of the torture scenes were new and ones i've never seen presented on film before.
Being familiar with miss Lohan's personal struggles much more than I am with her movies, I bought my ticket with a somewhat open-mind, even though after seeing the trailer (maybe the only bad element of the movie), I admit that I was basically expecting a teenage slasher movie.
This was so horrid...  Let me try it this way....  "You can't quit playing piano now, the BIG COMPETITION is coming up"  "But I don't want to play piano like Mozart anymore, even though I am amazingly talented on it, and my writing skills are just above a 5th grader, I know I am destined to be a writer!"
The plot is original in its essential form, but does contain some clichÃ©s here and there - all things considered though, this is an original premise that deals with certain scenarios not often seen in cinema (if at all).
I wouldn't recommend bringing small children to see this, though I doubt that will stop some people from bringing their kids along.
I can say that Lohan's performance seemed rather bland and stale throughout, as though in the back of her mind she knew the movie was trite and looked at it more as a paycheck than a serious mark on her resume.
And we start to think: she is in a so sad and depressing reality (comparing to ours), but what she says about life, future, politics, religion, believes and perspectives... though based on an ill mind, makes a lot of sense to us.
It is interesting though that no one mentioned Danny putting on that awful sweater with the letter on to conform to his image of Sandy.
The funny thing is, I liked this film, even though I had watched Twelve Monkeys just a couple hours earlier (I did a little theater hopping).
First of all, Danny is the leader of a gang, whose purpose is rebellion (as though teenagers needed any encouragement there, Ha, ha) Well, the gang isn't really violent, you say?
Even though it is set in the 50's, it seems to resonate even for today's generation.
My motherÂ´s strength had always lain in the free skating, though she had had a solid school-figures training.
My absolute favorite bit though, is when, at the very end, they are in Heaven and on wires and spinning around.
For Claude Chabrol,a cinÃ©aste who has made over 50 films,this film must be like one of his loving children.However,his admirers might view it in a different light as it might appear as a minor work for them but many serious viewers would nevertheless feel that there are some nice things to observe in this film.Au coeur du mensonge is a film about people who are grappling with truths and lies in their lives.This film is more of a character study even though it is true that there are two crimes depicted in the film.These vile acts are merely a pretext for small town people to talk of pretentiousness and infidelity.Au coeur du mensonge is also a story about two artists;one of them is a fake and other one is not so sure of his inherent abilities.There is also a woman in their midst who is torn between these two men.The message of this film is simple:To understand a lie,one has to go to its heart.When we watch Sandrine Bonnaire and Jacques Gamblin, we realize that the truth is not so complicated as it is always visible on surface level.
"Juste avant la nuit" ,though inferior to "la femme infidÃ¨le" "que la bÃªte meure","le boucher" or "la rupture" boasted a wonderful cast:Bouquet and Audran.Here,what have we?Sandrine Bonnaire,totally incredible as a doctor,Bulle Ogier,a grotesque matron,and Antoine de Caunes ,an "actor" generally cast in some ponderous French comedies.Fortunately,he dies half an hour before the end,what a relief!
There seemed to be a few genuinely creepy moments, and the gore was pretty heavy, though not as much of an all-out bloodbath as I was expecting from the trailer.
Later down the line (months, possibly years), the group of kids has a reunion at their friend-with-the-f'ed-up-stepmother's house and, conveniently, stepmom's still hanging around--though she seems pleasant enough.
Also, even though this movie didn't exactly scream for nudity, it would've elevated my grading of it by a point.
It was entertaining enough as a horror film though and the bloody-as-hell ultra-violence on display in the second half of the film makes up for the deficiencies of the rest of this thing, in my opinion.
It was still good though, Slade helped add the serious tone and each character actually had character development.
If you are expecting Teen Titans, though, this is not it.
It just keeps getting worse and worse, and in the end I was supporting the bad guys, even though they weren't exactly the most charismatic bunch of people I've witnessed.
Even though you never forget the seriousness of the situation, you start enjoying the sequence and the slight turns of the plot.
I think it works out though.
Hordak's slime pit toy was a corker though, wasn't it?
Even though the animation wasn't the greatest, well it was in '85!
And though it's no longer my favorite, it endures as an affecting cinematic experience.
I don't remember my mom laughing at those lines in 1985, though.
This movie was far more impressive then it's contemporary rival the rather silly (though still enjoyed) Conan the Barbarian.
I tend to take a more moderate position on this film, though far closer to the sugar end than the fuzzy end of the lolly-pop.
I can't help feeling disappointed, though.
Patrick Stewart (Captain of the Enterprise on Star Trek) is doing a superb performance as is Liam Neeson even though their roles are minor as knights of the Table.
You get this series, the first and third series if you can get ahold of them, a lot of movies (Though I only like a few), 2 manga series (One hasn't completely been out yet though, and there are others that haven't been released in English) as well as Lupin the first stuff (Novels from Maurice LeBlanc that Lupin III is based on, as well as movies based off those books, most being hard to get ahold of though), some people don't make their Lupin stuff very Lupin-ish though, so even if you don't really like what Lupin is, there still is probably something with the Lupin name you'll like.
It is as though she is remembering the truth sitting on that bench but it is too painful for her and she quickly retreats back to the fantasy (her kids come back to life and join her and her husband) 3) The real world present day where she is down and out listening to parts of scene one and scene two replay in her head constantly courtesy of her Schizophrenia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia)  The whole film up into the last scene is there to give you an impression of what being her and being schizophrenic is.
Even though Ariel Vromen succeeds to create a puzzling atmosphere and there are two or three enjoyable moments, I'd say that these 'twist in the end' fever has been pretty much overdone already.
More importantly, though, Rose makes the viewer aware that at a time when the U.S. military was developing weapons powerful enough to devastate any foe, some children were feeling nearly powerless in their own homes in the face of real threats to their safety.
The latter, though, slowly becomes more sympathetic as you understand his suffering more.
OK. You get to put some time into puzzling, which is in my opinion, very good, because there is a good balance between puzzling and battling, though sometimes there are just too many random battles.
The plot runs with three different romances, deals wonderfully with unrequited love, and really shows how difficult it is for some men to deal with their homosexuality (though it seems that it was 'dealt' with just fine in the snow scene.
Yehuda Levi as Jagger, in particular, was very likable and made the point that he was both idealistic, boyishly-goofy, romantic; and though he may have appeared naive, his blind innocence that came across made him more endearing.
"Yossi & Jagger", though primarily categorized as a "gay film", tugs at the most visceral feelings any person (gay or straight) can have -- the comfort that only comes with genuine and true love, the intense need to be true to one's self, and the sorrow that can only be brought about by a great loss.
Their homosexuality, though central to the story line, is portrayed as only one aspect of their incredibly complicated lives.
Based on a true story, the film is warm-hearted but inconsequential, with some annoyingly jerky hand-held camera movements, and the climactic scenes are a little too restrained to be entirely successful (though Knoller, in particular, gives a truly remarkable performance in the aftermath of a devastating plot development).
I really liked the old Quatermass films and even though I discovered them belatedly, being from the US, I got some enjoyment out of the TV series.
Norma will do anything for him, and she also truly believes she is still famous even though people barely remember her and she can make a comeback to Hollywood.
He reluctantly becomes her lover, though he's in love with Betty Schaefer (Nancy Olsen), also a screenwriter.
Everybody else is right on target though.
Gloria Swanson, however, steals every scene she's in; you can't turn away from watching her, even though she makes you really uncomfortable - it's like watching a train wreck.
Season 3 was the beginning of the end, though it had some interesting episodes and the ones concerning Jack were very solid.
This gem hit box offices in 2000, though there's a large chance that you were sick the day it was in theaters.. Disney mistakenly bills this as a Sandra Bullock romantic- comedy, which it isn't...
The sets were good for the most part though inconsistent, as were the style and overall appearance of the film (sometimes it was bright and technicolor and sometimes muted.)
Seriously, though, what is VIVA?
Now to the first title match for the Womens title featuring the Champion Trish Stratus and her opponent Jazz accompanied by Theodore Long.This was a one-on-one rematch from Wrestlemania,not so good though.
This is one of the Great ones: In terms of French cinema in the first full decade of Sound it belongs right up there with Marius, Fanny, Cesar, Quai des Brumes, Le Jour se leve, La Femme du boulanger, La Grande Illusion and you can't put anything higher than that though Duvivier's own La Belle equipe and Pepe Le Moko both come within a whisker.
This movie is far from being a children's-film, though it is definitely enjoyed by many.
I think that the team behind this had a success with The Hobbit, even though the animation was horrible.
I can't really get behind this "Return of the King" though.
With all of this in mind though, in retrospect it still might have been better if Rankin/Bass had done the whole thing.
When I was very young, I had seen these films and could enjoy Tolkien's story through them even though I was too young to appreciate the books.
When it became apparent, though, that the second Bakshi Ring movie would never come to pass, that made it possible for the folks at Rankin/Bass to seize a golden opportunity.
The closeup of Frodo's just bitten hand shaking as though it were an earthquake monitor was, for its time, the most horrifying scene R/B's animators had ever attempted.
Peola is portrayed to have a high level of intellect which will aide her to deal with her curse of having partial black blood coursing though her veins.
Even though the whole tragic mulatto concept is quite ridiculous, I find the 1959 version a much easier one to take.
For its time, this was a difficult topic to address in film, and though it was a touchy subject, I am sure many will disagree with my review of the film as an entire piece of work instead of focusing only on the subject matter.
Louise as Delilah, though she had a difficult and groundbreaking role to play in Hollywood history, when compared to one that may be as difficult if not more so as Hattie McDaniel in GWTW, she pales shamefully in comparison and her abilities as an actor (if any) simply don't come across.
In this version, Colbert is not an aspiring actress, but a saleswoman who enters into business with Beavers, who, though it's her pancake recipe, for some reason is entitled to only 20% of the profits.
The rest of the cast is adequate, though the real standout is Fredi Washington, a seminal black actress who portrays Peola with searing resentment and deepening regret.
I will say this though: I've heard that most guys, when they grow up, fall for women similar to their mothers.
Most interesting, though, is that the daughter passing for white is played here by a black actress, whereas in the version almost three decades later the character is taken by a Caucasian.
Ms. Beavers looks very pretty, though she is heavy.
Colbert looks good, though this was a little before she had hit on her trademark look with bangs.
The only one criticism I could having is that it is slightly uneven in choosing to display 7 different sketches answering seven different queries about sex as sometimes this feel as though the flow of the film is lost.
It is a one-gag skit, though burly Lou Jacobi makes the most of the material as the giddy crossdressing poppa.
"Sodomy," though hilarious in its deadpan way, is not all that different in stilted tone or pretentious theme from Allen's later efforts like INTERIORS, ANOTHER WOMAN or HUSBANDS AND WIVES.
Gee, what a cast Woody Allen was (and still is) able to muster for his movies, even though none of them is paid blockbuster wages since Allen's movies tend to draw in a selective audience.
game show, though brilliant premises, are far too drawn out, mirthless and shockingly unfunny.
Once again, Woody Allen directs, writes and stars (though not in every section).
Some times it's refreshing to just go back to Allen's early, silly films like Sleeper and Take The Money And Run, even though the man has gone onto important funny films with deep dramatic throughlines: Crimes & Misdemeanors, Deconstructing Harry and Husbands & Wives.
The film is entirely about sexual perversions, even though it is not technically eroticÂ Allen has taken some of the most popular clinical treatments of sexual fetishes and has placed them into very unusual situationsÂ   Gene Wilder, for example, falls in love with a sheep; Woody Allen plays a medieval court jester who gets his lance stuck in his lady's chastity belt while the king is off fighting in the Crusades; a giant breast is released upon the countryside; an Italian couple can only find happiness in public sex; and we are taken into the inner labors of a male human body as it tries to seduce a woman in a carÂ  Each individual scene is quite well doneÂ The tales are rapid filled with irony about the overly exaggerated importance of sex in our cultureÂ
The best part of the film is Sabato, Jr, though you have to wonder why he had anything to do with this piece of detritus.
I'd say you should see the movie though, just to get a laughter.
The soundtrack was fantastic and added so much value to the movie (especially the transition to the last scene on the train), even though it contained really only 2 songs.
The music, though, leaves much to be desired.
I am partial to these movies because I live in Wisconsin where deer hunting is part of our culture but this one is still a cute movie(I really wish we'd get a look at the hunters in these movies though!).
I was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie, though not as good as the original is far surpassing many Disney sequels.
On the other side of the coin, The Great Prince looked gorgeous as did the other deer.......Friend Owl was drawn absolutely spot on, though Thumper and Flower did look nice they still did'nt look quite enough like their original incarnations to retain all their charms.
Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode.
Audiences knew Bob from his Grammy winning comedy album, guest appearances on every variety show of the day and his two sitcoms: the first being a standard gentle comedy from the early sixties and the more famous and beloved one from the 1970s filled with winking innuendo, and was pretty racy by television standards, even though Dr. Robert Hartley and his beautiful wife Emily were married.
Elsewhere" and "Dallas" plot points were not played out the way they had, "Newhart's" ending, though still funny, wouldn't have had the incredible explosive impact it had.
Unfortunately the film is really bad and extremely boring, even though the two main characters seem to be quite good actors (but due to the "script" they are not allowed to show their talents).
Yet, "Tropical Malady" also brings a romantic tenor to the subject as it implies that the love between the two men has somehow moved into a more meaningful and primal stage, one bereft of the constricting and deadening rituals placed upon it by a civilized world (my suspicion is that is why the filmmakers chose to make this a love story between two men rather than one between a man and a woman, though, frankly, the Thai society we see doesn't seem to be particularly condemning or homophobic in its response to the lads).
It is very slow moving though, the first hour will give you no hint of the second half (other than a few visual ones, look at the various statues in the backgrounds, etc), but for the bold and the patient, there is lush hypnotic reward to be had.
You might be surprised when I point out that Carter never fought Griffith for a world championship in 1963 though he did fight for the middlewight championship a year later against champion Joey Giardello who beat him on points with plenty to spare .
Thankfully justice is served though be it belatedly when a bunch of Canadians expose this terrible miscarriage of justice and Rubin is set free .
People felt sorry for him, even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society.
But what memories about CRITTERS though.
they steal his wife, need her as a hostage, though they didn't really....need a hostage at all.
Even though, their acting skills in this one could not lift this movie to passable, the rest was just WAY too bad!
An organic virus is much more complex, even though it's way tinier.
I felt as though I had been beat over the head with the so-called mysterious explanation for the disease killing people.
This is supposed to support the idea that the bodies have calcified -- though how the virus would accomplish this transmutation is an exercise left for the student (viewer).
I couldn't help thinking, though, that Janine Turner is a bit of a Geena Davis look-a-like.
Oh yes--and even though the seams showed and it creaked a lot, my heart rate went up, and I was reluctant to get up and take a break.
I was shocked at how empty and limp the stories were, though punctuated by increasingly spectacular yet predictable 'shouts' with associated danger, drama and of course death.
There was certainly potential at times for the film to get fairly gruesome, though it remains a family affair.
The film itself was kind of interesting though.
It seems as though the screenwriter was trying too hard to make jokes rather than allowing them to flow organically from the situation.
Even though he faces ramifications for his actions, he doesn't learn.
Knowing that Ed Wood is behind this movie can make the tough storyline easier to watch.The finger pointing at the parents may be hard for some to take.There are many parents breaking butt in life to provide for family and instilling religious values in them but they mess-up anyway(the family not the parents).Making the parents look bad in this movie may be touching a sore area for some persons.One comment that the judge lost interest in his own speech half way through it was very funny,I remember seeing the top of the judge's head and wondering if he was reading the script or falling asleep.Showing them off sweaters are popular in this movie even the older Sheila(Lee Constant)comes out with in-your-face lookers too.Being an Ed Wood movie though Sheila could be a cross-dresser.
At least twenty hits of brutal visual salmonella carcases in all, as though someone broke into your mind and contaminated your thinking processes.
In my family it has become a tradition to watch this film on Christmas eve, though we know everything which will happen in the film, even most of the dialogue, by heart.
the mouse.that's right,i said mouse.there's a mouse in the movie,and even though it has the briefest of cameos,it was the best actor in the(alleged)movie.for some reason,i watched this right to the bitter end.
The effects, for all their Ray Harryhausen fame, are pretty basic, though there are a lot of them (the ape, but also lions behind glass, and some mutilation to the lions, beware).
So even though it's basically a rip-off gone bad of Stripes, Police Academy has SOME funny moments, at least enough for a friday night viewing.
SECRETS has an entirely different feel to it , in many ways it feels neither like a cynical marketing excersise nor a feature film but more like a theater play , and even though I haven`t bothered to check I`m probably right in saying SECRETS started life off as a play .
"Allan Quatermain And the Lost City Of Gold" is the adventure genre's "Plan 9 From Outer Space" (though the special effects are slightly better), and I can still enjoy watching this delightly dreadful disaster of an adventure film.
The 'recupero,' as the Italian film industry dubbed it, was one of the most forlornly hopeful forms of film-making: offsetting part of the cost of the film you wanted to make by filming another on the cheap back-to-back with as many of the same cast, crew and locations as possible in the hope that at least one of them would be a hit even though just about the only recorded case of that ever happening was when Il Magnifico Straniero, shot back-to-back with Bullets Don't Argue to 'use up waste materials,' became a surprise hit after changing its title to Fistful of Dollars.
Chamberlain is barely making an effort here and clearly gives up near the end, though it's no surprise in a film that looks like only the rehearsals were shot, and only one take at that.
It did not have the feel of the other films (aside for the chronic overacting)and thus left me feeling as though I was watching any old "camp in woods, people dying flick".
even though the two sequels were even cheesier they were watchable movies and the second one is way underrated in my opinion.
Even though all you have to do is kick your legs to get away, you shan't do it and shall succumb to your transfatty fate!
Whereas the kid playing Weed shall look and act like the kid who played Stewie on Malcolm in the Middle, but all shall find dread whence looking upon IMDb and realizing that though he did guest star on an episode of yon horrid series, he playest Stewie NOT!
Even though I do acknowledge the existence of nasty people in this world, it's not realistic to fill a movie with people swearing all the time, constantly using physical violence and insulting each other 24-7...
I enjoyed most of the murders and even though some of them were a little bit far-fetched, I still think they were good enough for the slasher sub-genre.
and even though I had fallen asleep, it was like I had watched the whole thing, very apt there is torture in this film as it was torture for me to watch it.
though i guess i wouldn't have minded the teleprompter-ish quality to the dialogue if what was on the teleprompters weren't so retarded.
When I was watching this movie, i thought, huh, maybe it will get better and when it didn't i though maybe it will actually go somewhere but no.
Of course, my comments could be attributed to my unfamiliarity with Anne Tyler's novels or lack of attention to slow, sleepy, small-town southern culture (though I enjoyed the 1989 film, "Steel Magnolias").
and its so true but sad how even though her mom treated her soo bad she still loved her and felt bad for --what happened-.
Annoying full-length shots of women being overpowered and strangled without any real sexual violation, even though the killer(s?)
I guess it's nice to know that Rip Torn is still managing to get work though.
The girl's easy on the eyes, though, but apparently she now relies on her Backstreet Boy husband for life support now.
I really shouldn't be complaining though, it was free after all...
The most annoying thing though is how easily grown adults get beaten up by pesky little kids.
I want them to be a bit more serious than that even though they don't have to be "good".
No great ideas for the plot, no mindgrabbing gorie effects (there is a high amount of blood though), no good jokes.no nothing really.
You DON'T have to be Norwegian to understand subtleties of this movie (maybe you just need to be a kid, even though grown up :)  This piece was superbly translated into Russian and I remember some of them till now.
I actually think the funniest and most interesting part of the movie was the credits, though.
A low-budget movie, and it shows... some pretty bad acting; though Ice T was very good.
The contrast in acting styles from Nina Hoss (Yella) are minimal, at several occasions looking as though it is too painful to smile.
The three standouts, though, are as follows.
Overall though, the mini-series was a below average effort for such a promising story.
I saw this mini series a couple of years ago after searching on the internet and found this film adaptation from Canada (I live in England) and I though 'great' so I bittor... err... obtained a copy and watched it all - I'm not sure how - in abject horror.
I have to disagree with other texts in this 'genre' however - Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Narnia - all clearly with staggering budgets of course and various contract obligations obviously in the case of the irritating though opportunistic and hard working Rowling.
Suddenly, a cloud flys into their face, and even though everybody is only a foot away, they looked like they were taking the opportunity to catch their breath before finishing those last twelve inches.
I kept watching it though ... sadly I fear just to able to say 'hey have you seen McCinsey's Island ... has to be the worst film I've ever seen'.
The zombies in this aren't a bad lot really, they still have their human personalities & even though some like to eat human flesh most don't.
Too many images of American flags, as though they want to equate America with intolerance, but hey, that's probably the kind of crap being taught at film schools today.
I was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up.
Kevin Spacey (my favorite actor of all), turns in a good performance, not a great one, though he gets Quoyle just about spot on if you cut away all the parts about how fat Quoyle is and he is 10 times more insecure than Spacey portrays him, but maybe thats a problem of script.
I didn't find Joe all that annoying, though I could see why others would.
Lubitsch was very successful with these types of pictures, though--paving the way for the exportation of German films and the emigration of himself to Hollywood.
After a while, though, she seems to have become obsessed with young Robin, as she soon starts popping out of everywhere at any time to try and spend time with her, to an alarmingly excessive degree.
It starts to frighten Robin, as she tries to avoid her completely, though her parents tend to differ on their views of Dorothy: her Mother gets worried as she perceives subtle signs of nefarious intent in Dorothy, though her Father thinks she innocuous and a reliable baby-sitter for robin.
If it weren't for Evan, I would've changed the channel (though seen during one of my insomniac nights, I didn't have a whole lot of other options), and she was, without exaggeration, the only thing worth watching in this ineptly produced dreck.
Even though he says to the reporter that he would KILL HIMSELF if it was ever found out he was Jewish he gives these obvious clues throughout the film.
Danny offends the speakers and walks out prematurely even though the instructor warns him that he will be resentenced if he leaves.
The acting: Rutger Hauer, though undoubtedly the best actor of the cast, seems hopelessly lost in this movie.
Initially, it looked like the focus would be on recovering and perhaps (though this was my instinct) the characters emerging from their ordeal with new directions and outlooks.
The somewhat wooden performance given by Chris Cooper didn't help much, though he is generally a good performer.
You would be forgiven for leaving this film feeling as though there was something "missing" about it.
"Crips and Bloods: Made in America" was made in America on a nifty computer, by a filmmaker who thinks good editing entails hammering on the keyboard as though it were a drum kit; how cool.
The problem with this film isn't just that it's not a good film (though, truly, it isn't very good); its problem is that it should probably never have been made.
Terry is suspicious about his neighbor from the first time he sees him, though for no real reason except overexposure to news media.
If one can judge by this film alone (as, unfortunately, I must, though that won't be the case for long), Marins' big influences are Jung, Bosch, and E.C.
Appaloosa's does have some good points though.
But feardotcom was so distasteful, so indulgent in its love of the gore (mild though it was) that I mostly felt a little dirty for watching, kinda like I'd watch a snuff film.
Of course every character in the movie logged onto the website even though they knew damn well it would kill them.
(though I don't think that there's anything to spoil here...)   I really don't know, how could I force myself not to turn this movie off after the first 20 minutes or so.
Surely they can still do better even though they both have seen their best times.
Which stays at the same length the whole film, even though the film covers quite a few days (it was hard tell, nothing was very coherent) And guess what!
I'll be surprised if gets released at all (though the executive producer said Warner Bros had picked it up for US distribution, and Columbia-Tri-Star for the rest of the world.
The one thing that few of his movies had, though, was a coherent script, and this movie is a prime example.
I did have fun watching it though, and I suspect that that has more to do with the beauty of Olivia Wilde, who is, a stone cold fox.
Fast forward though a few phone calls and long walks and we get to the end.
There are better propaganda movies though as this is just a bit of a silly one...  4/10.
Toni Collette's atrocious overacting (nothing personal though), especially in the unconvincing grief scenes did nothing to help this lamo movie, in fact made it worse and I only watched it to see if it got better.
When I heard the title "Japanese Story", I though there might be something really aesthetic or unique about this movie and was expecting something with artistic value.
The acting is all fine, particularly the lead man and the voice on the phone (you'll know what I mean when you see it, it really is a lead role even though you never meet him) but there are so many wholes in the story that it never came together for me.
That meant I had some expectations for this one, even though a guy I had never heard of before, Kevin Sorbo, had taken over the lead.
Several times, Stewart actually turns his camera around underwater so we can see him, as though his presence amongst the sea's inhabitants is itself vital to the "balance in the seas" that he longs to preserve or reestablish.
It does have a happy ending though (sort of).
More disturbing than this fact alone, they can actually cause an individual to hear voices within their own mind (even though the movie depicted the use of cell phones).
Cathy and her brother Chris do not go on to have a love affair, though, like they did in the book.
On top of that, the acting wasn't very good, though Kristy Swanson does look like Cathy would.
The main failure though is probably that the way V.C.
I gave the first four books very high ratings on Amazon, though they disturbed me greatly, and in a way, I hate them for that.
In this film, even though he starts out to be a businessman who doesn't take no for an answer, he turns out to be a wimp.
Ella Raines and Helen Walker did a good job, though I think Ella's character should have gotten stronger and nastier after she found out that her husband was alive and her lover was dead.
This film was so dull, that for the first time, IMDb has said my comments were too brief even though I can't think of what else to say.
And though with the script still a bit amateurish, Gamazon somehow scores an almost convincing portrayal.
Actually I am getting sick of Sr B watching him in every other movie (though eagerly waiting for Verma's Sarkar).
Davis's boyfriend (John Hodiak) is uncomfortable with the attention Davis is giving to Milland, even though there is no romantic angle to it.
Her horrible warbling is exactly what the producers were looking for and back in 1934 it would have gone over quite well at the time--after all, she could sing, though in a style that is so out of style today that many will find the singing quite painful (my ears are still bleeding).
After traveling the world and gaining great fame, Irene is determined to go back to Australia, as she knows she loves him and must marry him--even though they barely know each other and he is currently on the run again.
Fuller follows three young people, two men (one played by himself) and a girl, only one of whose names we even learn through the course of the film (though all of the characters have names according to the closing credits).
I loved Purple Rain, though.
Can't blame him for trying though.
Benny G though has been stuck in the past, constantly thinking of his fame he once had.
The biggest disappointment though is Molloy.
I felt my interest waning as the story seemed to limp along to an extremely unsatisfying ending (however at that point I no longer cared) It IS always cool to see Oldman though.
There is one scene though that I did like where Harrison has gone out and picked up a hustler for the night(lord he must have been hard up ,the blond man he takes home is ugly and certainly not that young).Anyway after humiliating Burton in front of this man by drinking and laughing ,Harrison finally goes too far and Burton backhands him hard against a bookcase causing him to bleed.
Worth seeing only for the curiosity factor of Rex Harrison and Richard Burton playing 2 middle aged queens living together and hating each other in some London slum (though filmed in Paris) There is not one witty line or any sense of affection or reason why these 2 bitter losers stayed together for so long.
A last positive word though, I kind of liked the ending that really surprised me and specially the words spoken by "Black Cat" : "Life is not like in Anime!
I LOVE James Dean even though I was born 15 years after his death.
), especially the girl with the freckles, though Holly Hunter was fairly annoying.
There were thought-provoking questions though like, "if you're totally fulfilled in a relationship and found out that (the guy) cheated on you, would everything be a lie?"
It seems as though a bunch of people who meant well and really liked musicals ( MAC makeup, Max Azairi(costumes), Travis Payne(choreography)) got together and attempted to make one of their own without even trying to learn how beforehand.
To provide examples of my tastes, I'll cite "The Beloved," "A Clockwork Orange," "Dogville" and "Stalker," (though not nearly as good as these, I'd much rather watch "American Psycho" than TotW).
In "The Rapture," there was a sociological element that was effective (though I'm not suggesting this film was excellent - again, at least it was a "film"!).
i still want it back though.
I liked the barn idea though, the unusually big barn with several parts.
I enjoyed The Next Generation (though it was a lot more fantasy than I was expecting from science fiction), and I do like Enterprise (despite its often cheesy writing); I've even liked the few Babylon 5 episodes I've seen.
Voyager had the occasional excellent episode, usually the 2 parters, and it did have some good actors amongst the cast, though the parts they played rarely gave them the opportunity to display this.
Please do not waste your time w/this even though you can watch it free online if you have a Netflix membership, please don't let that fool you.
The first season wasn't bad, though it did rely on time travel too much, but then the writers got lazy.
Although by the first regular episode they were having power problems (though conveniently and stupidly the holodecks ran off incompatible reactors), potential problems were never really dealt with.
It wasn't at anything that was said or done though.
One great thing though was the villain Mewtwo!
Why this precedes the film is quite a mystery, though I can only suggest that it's because the film itself is too short.
Something I gotta say, though: reading Roger Ebert's review about this film, he said something about no one being able to explain the concept, not even the fans of the show.
This is a rare exception though.
I will admit though, Mew is really cute.
Being an ex-addict himself, he tries to reach out to Kelly though Kelly refuses to talk to him.
I wrote a similar script (though much better) and entered it into a screen writing contest...I never heard back from them.
Not long after that did I see production began on this movie and there are striking similarities to my script and this movie...though this movie is much lower quality and has less production value.
It does get slightly better once most people die though.
The introduction and start of the movie makes it feel like at least a partly good one, though during its continuation, it clearly shines through as what it really is: A piece of utter wasted time and money.
You could probably make a drinking game out of it, though...everyone slams a shot whenever a foam rubber rock moves.
Unfortunately, the film carries an ominous air of boredom to it throughout; It's almost as though no one involved had any faith in the production from the very start as evidenced by the lazy performances, generally bland action sequences (for a PM production) and a meandering 'plot' which goes no where.
While talking to Taskin about the Death Touch case, Bill says he also cares about Amanda, though we never really find out exactly who Amanda is from what I can tell.
Death Touch later has sex with another prostitute, Jessie, but when he starts to hurt her (well, she is apparently supposed to be in pain even though she is smiling), the hotel manager comes running and Death Touch attacks him.
The story was borderline brilliant, though I can see why people would disagree.
Apparently she was all better though.
The score was actually OK though (just not the boom boom stuff), and the acting was all fine, sometimes quite impressive.
The only thing is, it is done so well you are impelled to watch some more, the characters so convincingly portrayed that even though a great deal of fictional license is taken in portraying historical figures, the feel and sense of the place and the people who lived there seem real.
I was intrigued though with the "greaser" conversation he had with his little boy.
I had no idea why he hated Blade so badly through out this movie though.
I stumbled over this movie, and though I had found what I was looking for because of the good reviews and interesting plot, but I was really WRONG!
I give it a three out of ten because at least McNamara owned up to something, though not nearly enough, while Henry Kissinger still walks the streets with his goodies intact.
This "Double Indemnity" parody is just not worthy of any of them though.
I didn't get this comedy though, I just didn't find it funny.
Congratulations though to the actor playing Ian.
And I gotta admit that even though I'm quite a huge fan of Uwe Boll's work, I personally wasn't 100% sure either what to expect from a project like this...
It's like they didn't even really tried, though I do admit some of the dialog was highly amusing.
It was a fun watch, though it didn't quite hold up to the grimy urban 'horror' feel of the first movie.
Granted, his 'sellout' streak lead to a 15 year hiatus, though I doubt that it was "Basket Case 3", entirely, which signaled this halt in his career.
though its not that great and still some visible cracks but at least its the cracks are not so wide.
It doesn't even do a particularly good job of capturing the mood of the era, though it's inevitable, of course, that some of that comes through.
(SPOILER ALERT) The death scenes are great fun though.
This movie was even shot (not released, though) before "Black Christmas", and that classic horror film is more or less regarded to as the granddaddy of ALL crazy murderers on the loose flicks!
They all go, even though it's unclear who invited them, and end up in an isolated mansion in the middle of nowhere.
The acting is about par for this kind of movie and though it is clearly a product of the seventies, it doesn't seem too dated.
All in all though this movie bogs down more than once as it seems it would rather focus on the people rather than the monsters.
At the end though there is an all out monster attack as we regain control of the monsters, but it isn't much fun as it has poor King Gidorah squaring off against way to many monsters, they really should have given him an ally to help him...unfortunately, Gigan and MechaGodzilla had not come into being yet.
PLOT: 95 pound weakling gets a hold of a magic staff and needs to return it to it's rightful owner - a martial arts master, along the way he befriends people that magically speak English even though they are Chinese that have never seen a white guy.. and that's just one of a long list of groaners that will make you go.. please kill me I can't stand this anymore.
Which is why I gave it a "5", even though it's one of the worst movie experiences I've had in years - to separate it from the more spectacularly junky experience of a "sub-3" movie.
This is not exactly an Ed Wood movie, though when I got it from Netflix his name was plastered on it--not the director and co-writer's, Adrian Weiss.
Wood co-wrote this low-budget and creepy film but it lacks the tackiness and cheapness of his own directorial efforts--though it is pretty close.
It's almost as though it turned into a Safari movie and a boring one at that.
Boll is just the director and a film is a sum of its parts, even though Boll directed this film, there were dozens of earnest and hardworking actors and crew members putting in their all to make this film.
Nice designated pinch hitter though, for exotic "color"?
Now though, this particular films makes for a rather nostalgic time, but it's truly not a very good movie.
Tarantulas: The Deadly Cargo maybe good for one thing though, to stretch the running time out Hagmann pads the film with seemingly endless shots of the orange factory & it's inner workings so if you've ever wanted to know what happens in an (70's) orange factory here's your chance!
This is one of Leslie Nielsen's worst movies ever, even though he's not really the main character.
Also, the movie didn't go by all the facts, even though these things were small in nature - for example, Billy Flynn was not a blond guy, he has brown hair and certain things in the film were altered from the true facts that were reported on national television when Pamela Smart was on trial for the murder of her husband, Greg Smart.
Likewise, a very warm-hearted series of relationships bud between Kincaid and his elderly friends (showing that this kid is goodhearted -- even though he's a bada**).
I guess I am a voice of dissent, but I didn't like the film--though I did at least respect the acting (for the most part) and give it a 4 simply for technical merit.
The last third of the movie isn't too bad though, delivering some decent suspense scenes, though there is probably one "twist" too many in the end.
The story did move quite briskly, though, and it was occasionally difficult to keep up with the plot developments.
I was watching the episode on tape, though, so it wasn't a big issue for me.
Yashraj films are normally considered the best production house even though they have done worst copies(compared to Bhatt who give at least better films though copies) And have made trash films  The film is a lame copy of NINE MONTHS  The comedy scenes are puerile except Jaaved's scenes rest are nothing great, the shouting scenes are lame  The twist is well handled but then nothing much happens and the film ends in a very bad manner  Siddharth Anand handles only few scenes well, many scenes are over the top Music is good  Saif repeats his DCH act and acts well though he often cribs and gets boring Preity is good in serious scenes but overdoes many parts Jaaved is funny Abhishek hams Jugal is okay
I'd recommend the soundtrack, even though I absolutely abhor the movie.
Without giving too much away for those that want to waste time watching this, there are situations that develop that feel as though there were lifted right out of a Three's Company episode with Jack Tripper being put in compromising situations that are then misunderstood.
The finale of the film features a birthing scene that looks as though it could have been a Three Stooges short as Abhishek Bachchan plays the clueless obstetrician who apparently gets anxiety attacks while doing his job!
They are constantly yelling at each other while trying too hard to appear as though there is love between them.
It doesn't quite work, though.
Other than that, though... ...worthless.
The acting is OK. Dan Stevens stands out as the German, though his role is stupid.
All others, though, should stick to the better monster films from Universal and Hammer--they are light-years ahead of this one.
In fact, the vampires dominate most of the proceedings during the latter stages of the film, while early on there's also excess footage featuring a gypsy couple (who, for plot purposes, unwittingly revive the werewolf which subsequently 'marks' Waldemar Daninsky); however, despite the limited resources at the film-makers' disposal, the Gothic atmosphere is well up to par for the course (though dissipated somewhat by the faded print I watched!
As a really, really ineptly made movie, though, it's godawful.
how bout this though.
Why does she help Dial even though he's a wanted fugitive ?
Miss Marple's nephew Raymond comes along though he's really not needed (I didn't like the fake nephew Lionel added to the Hickson version either) and Churchett gives us possibly the most irritating made up character ever in Ronni Ancona's screeching Miss Dalrymple (why didn't someone kill her?).
Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more, even from a score of 5.8 IMDb, the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal, the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a "worst case scenario" of playing "strong" feelings accompanied by some bad acting... Don't waist your time this movie Ã­snt entertaining, if you wanna cry it might suffice though, even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy...
Maggie Gyllenhal is pretty, though.
The writing is the worst part of it, in fact, though the writers did accomplish several feats I had previously assumed were mutually exclusive: they made the plot over-the-top yet unimaginative, the dialogue simple-minded yet smug, and the punchlines clichÃ©d yet unfamiliar (clichÃ©s are clichÃ©s because at some point there were funny, but the ones in My Boys lacked any vestige of humor).
Great stories all the way though.
though he couldn't think of reason why because hes like that..  My mother who is 40 didn't understand it and my father (born on the same day and year as my mother) though it was really really weird.
However, "To All a Good Night" is a cut above most derivative slashers, even though it starts out with the mandatory sex-obsessed sorority girls (plus one cute wallflower) and assembly-line violence, it gets progressively better as it goes alongÂcreating an adequate atmosphere of dread and giving its surviving characters a bit of personality and humanity.
I was amused as I watched this flick how characters are blunt and honest about others giggling and insulting them while they are still in the room(..such as gardener Ralph who seems to be the butt of everyone's jokes, even though he moves about, saying little, without really warranting such constant ridicule, despite the fact that he's a wee bit creepy).
It was sooo long though, I was basically counting the minutes haha.
Not only that, though.
Even though the narration of the film is from the boy, there are flashbacks from everyone including the dog.
The move start-out OK, a little melodramatic though, you get a really good descriptions of the characters and starts to absorb into them in good or bad ways.
The film would be more well known today had either of them done it, though John Halliday does a fine job in the lead.
Still though it ends interestingly enough and there are some people who may like this kind of horror drama hybrid.
The native vegetation, the waterways, the buildings and much of the supporting cast certainly don't look Hawaiian to me, though I could be mistaken.
The creature does manage to cause around half a dozen explosions in the film, though.
Shot in Burlington in North Carolina apparently, I doubt this is going to do much for the tourist numbers though.
Sadly, though, its shock value is not matched by actually bothering to substantiate its case.
For outdoor scenes on the vampire planet where they land, magenta-colored filters were used--though later they abruptly became green filters, red and then yellow filters!
Sadly,though, no matter how inept this film is, generally it's very dull and not even worth seeing so you can laugh at its ineptness.
Even though this film was made a few years ago, and this problem is perhaps a little more evident today, the principal's speeches about teachers and school officials hugging and touching students to make them feel good, etc., was incredibly stupid and naive on the part of the writers.
the best thing i liked about the movie was the comedy, though.
(Man, that Toxic voice-over was hilarious, though I never knew if it was one of the jokes.)
I will say though this movie is obviously set up as a comedic fun-ride and not to be taken seriously for a second, the underling messages of homophobia and violence against kids still is very disturbing.
It focuses too much on new age beliefs and philosophy as though no other culture has contributed to the progress of mankind and civilization.
But even though it's full of child imagination in it (robot friend in school, entering game's world, be friend with a cute girl friend...), the story is to typical towards the end.
In fact, the most intelligent Bollywood movie I have ever seen (not copying from any Hollywood or European movies) is : MOKSHA...though it went flat amidst Indian audiences.
My advise watch this if you really and even really bored, but overall the film was not to my liking and I'd say to any of my friends not to bother with it, even though it's got good actors in it.
One thing I do have to give him credit for though is that he doesn't pussyfoot around showing boobs.
I don't know where to begin with this abysmal blunder, first off though (and most obvious) Nicole DuPont CANNOT ACT.
Along the way you get the obvious surprise and a bit of gore, not to much though considering this is a cannibal movie.
Given the somewhat entertaining track record of these After Dark films, I had some certain expectations with the given supporting cast of Michael Madsen, Vinnie Jones, and Micheal Kelly though in reality they've had a little more than brief cameos.
Despite having flaws it is watchable, though its probably best watched while doing something else (I'm guessing that you'll probably fall asleep if you watch it straight).
First off, even though the run-time is listed as 94 minutes, this thing dragged on forever.
'Mark' ('Happy Harry') never quite does the right thing, as he continues to transmit even though he knows he should stop.
From the ludicrously over the top car chases, to the hackneyed dialogue, wholly predictable plot "twists" and diabolical attempts at comedy there's always something to laugh at (though never with).
It wasn't though as this exploitation/sci-fi garbage has little in the way of interest and doesn't manage to create anything worthy of the great ideas brought forward in the superior Kubrick film.
Even though its a bit dull, the film is saved by the moronic dialog which offers plenty of unintentional laughs and the overall strangeness of the product.
I did manage to sit through the whole film though, but kept asking myself "what message is this film trying to say".
Sadly (although there's plenty of funding for this sort of thing) though, it fails on many many levels.
The cast was OK but acted as though they had just read their lines 5 minutes before and wanted to call it a day as soon as possible.
Even though the film looks decent enough, and the acting is fair, the plot isn't intriguing enough to make you want to continue watching it.
I have to say though I agree that the score of this movie was beautiful, I may have to find a copy somewhere.
It felt rushed as well, even though it was quit close to the original story.
Dressed in a two-piece bathing suit, Megghy has a figure that recalls Michelle Johnson in Stanley Donen's "Blame it on Rio", but Stefania lets it go, even though her niece is properly attired for a "porn star convention".
Hasnain Hyderabadwala & Raksha Mistry after copying COLLATERAL and making THE KILLER(2006) remake again This time their film THE TRAIN is a remake of DERAILED a film which wasn't that great in the first place  The film looks similar to Emraan's own ZEHER in fact the promos and also the songs plus the adultery theme is so much ZEHER  The film could be a decent thriller but sadly the film comes too late even the chemistry between Emraan and Sayali Bhagat is bad The sub plot of their daughter is good but the rest film however isn't as engrossing  The problem is predictability and also the feeling of deja vu plus the villain's characterization isn't too convincing and the final twist is predictable too  Direction is okay Music is a winner, especially ZINDAGI NE, MAUSAM, WOH AJNABEE Camera-work is good  Emraan is good in his part and is getting more dependable though the role is too similar to ZEHER Sayali Bhagat is weak while Geeta Basra is better much has a way to go Aseem Merchant irritates Suresh Menon is as usual, Rajat Bedi fills the bill
But especially in light of (1) and (2), though, whatever it is, it is stinkily obscene.
Anyway, the dog does all kinds of deadly tricks, like a curling iron in the bath tub, jumping out of the seat of a car to scare the owner backward into oncoming traffic, and even strangulation of her owner's boyfriend with the dog leash while he's dozing up against a tree.....and the guy is dead and the dog is lying by his side as though nothing had happened, and the cops are looking for someone that strangled him while a 100-lb.
I've been after this movie for a while, though mainly because of the cool VHS cover and the fact that Yvonne De Carlo is in it.
Even though a 'small' film it clearly shows that it was made by a major studio and has all the standard M.G.M.
To watch a re-run like I have today meant blushing with embarrassment at the though that I once found the dialog funny and cool.
That is the real lesson, even though it promises to be a sad one.
Banek objects to such forgery on ethical grounds, even though his own behaviour towards Gipson is just as illegal and could be regarded as even more immoral.
Honestly, though, this show started out bad and just got worse.
*** spoiler warning ***  A nice touch though were the various German references (though the will probably be obsolete in a few years) and especially the inclusion of Kalkofe's long time opponent Achim Mentzel as the original "Der Wixxer".
It definitely has a "new age" touch, it's mysterious, and with a nice bit of surreal/sci-fi - if you liked movies the same pace and style as K-Pax (though this one is a bit more geared towards kids), then you'll probably like Mimzy.
Even though it is true that the actresses don't act in this to save their lives, the truth is that they are given almost no space to even try.
That script though...my lord.
The younger kids (10 and under) did not seem to enjoy it as much as the adults and teens though.
I rate this a two, because I know some of the actors' are better then the material, and there are a couple decent kill scenes in the end, though nothing special.
I knew almost nothing about the Pixies before watching loudQUIETloud, and now having seen it, I still feel as though I know nothing about them.
Even though all the cast is pretty good and the plot appealing (a drama of cheating between longtime friends), unfortunately, they are helpless to save the movie.
Incidentally the kid was kidnapped (in the movie) by what was once a talented actor - though he was always weird..
But, the acting was terrific even though the performances didn't relate to everything else going on.
No complains with K. Basinger and Billy Bob though there is no mayor performance in the cast.
It's light years away from the depth, originality and brilliance of "Short Cuts", though.
I look over and the man was tearing up and I though he was nearly about to breakdown in full tears.
While the veteran actors seemed to add depth to their performances (beyond the material presented) these two "acted" on a very shallow level, as though trying to imitate the type of person they thought they were playing.
The movie begins as though it might hold together, but slowly comes apart until, toward the end, director Brett Leonard ("Lawnmower Man," "Virtuosity") leaves logic adrift entirely and has his hero (and us) lamely rolling around in body parts and fluids.
Perhaps most important though is the inevitable twist ending, which for the sake of formality I will fail to spoil for you but needless to say, probably had our beloved screenwriter sporting wood from self-adulation.
The lovely model Jeanne HÃ©buterne (Elsa Zylberstein) who was the subject not only of his portraits but the mother of his illegitimate child and his live-in paramour is a bit long in the tooth on suffering, though despite the fact that Zylberstien is hampered by both a weak script and limited acting, she does have an uncanny resemblance to Jeanne.
Nobody believes him, even though he is, in fact, correct.
Even though it's a "new" plot, they've kept a lot of familiar Robin Hood -themes in the film, including an archery contest and the same old villains - what would a Robin Hood -story be without Prince John and the Sheriff of Nottingham, after all?
The movie doesn't really explore medieval gender roles all that deeply, though - Gwyn dressing as a man is made slightly fun of, but there's no shock nor any disapproval of what might have even be considered sinful back then.
at one point (forgive my non chron account) he even agrees to see this one girl who is not very pretty and who kind of masochistically insists on making it very clear that he doesn't really like her, in spite of which though of course because there is something seriously wrong with this guy he's willing to be with her...in fact when she's shooting a gun it really makes him think she looks "awesome" OK sure why not, look on the bright side why don't you.
and there is one of those corny things where the beginning is the same as the end it's recursive and... as you see people on IMDb are puzzling over how to make sense out of that...I neglected to mention the beginning though, but it must be the key to the whole thing eh what?
I really enjoyed the same director's "The Isle" though!
I hope that hot doll face makes lots more movies though, he was awesome... better still why doesn't he just come to America and sweep me off my feet.
And even though The Monkey Hustle gets lumped in with the blaxploitation movies of the period, it lacks the sex, violence, and emotional charge necessary to be considered as such.
However, unlike CAR WASH, this isn't a comedy though there are a few mildly funny moments.
She also, had no idea how to hold a bow, though she was more convincing.
It has a lot of flaws, though.
He seemed too forced and didn't look as though he were enjoying himself playing Grover Cleaver.
Still I like Norm MacDonald and he does his best, though he doesn't have much to work with.
The fact they used inexperienced local "talent" to fill out the cast, along with providing these laughably bad amateur thesps with truly rotten dialogue throughout the film, is the only point of possible enjoyment, though even that got old quickly.
Probably best known as THE CRAWLERS here in the States, though the version I viewed was titled CREEPERS.
Let's count our blessings though.
I would recommend it to anyone, especially children, though there wasn't any dialog the humor came across just as good or even better as if there was.
And though he's already been caught by both the police and his wife in flagrante delicto, he has no problem getting it on with the blond boy in his hotel room while his wife reads Cosmo by the poolside (we don't see this happen, but it's clearly implied).
More pertinently though, both rely on contemporary references to be funny.
In the end though, if you want to see boatloads of female nudity, you might as well watch a Playboy video than this tripe.
It's fascinating to watch, though.
Even though this is a sub movie, 98% of the action take place between humans far from the sub.
And of course, even though the name of the movie is Nautilus and is about a sub, there is zero connection between it, and the writings of Jules Verne.
Like all the made for TV movies though, the film is somewhat too flat to make it a real movie, but Keira and crew do it justice.
Maybe I'm in a minority though.
That's one of the reasons I watched it, though hesitant, I still viewed it anyway.
In fact not surprising  As far Deniro goes though, his performance is bloody awful.
Mad Dog doesn't catch the person and the assailant escapes, though I believe he is captured later on though that isn't relevant here.\ Murray's character as we learn is a top and tough Mafia Boss named Frank Milo.
Milo though loves Mad Dog as he has just saved his life in this holdup.
Throw in Portia De Rossi as Dreyfuss's daughter (and the 'I hate him for no apparent reason, no wait, now I love him for no apparent reason' relationship with Slater - and I use the term 'relationship' lightly; Tom Cruise had more chemistry with the fish in 'Jerry Maguire'), a painful cameo by RuPaul, a moderately funny though sadly underused Billy Connolly, a mob boss with all the menacing screen presence of American Pie's Chris Klein, two mob button men more cut out for a Home Alone sequel and a soundtrack that sounds like background music from a computer game, then have almost the entire movie played out as a series of flashbacks that Slater is telling mob hitman Critical Jim (played by Tim Allen, who is constantly quoting classic movies a la Remington Steele) and have the audience needlessly wonder at how much of what Slater is saying is true, if anything, and what kind of plot twist might be in store (needlessly wonder because *Spoiler* it's all true and there is no plot twist), and end it all with a cliched train station finish...  Well, what can I say.
No worries for her though because a dead relative that talks through the answering machine (only after the beep) to her will help guide her through the advances of dirty old men wielding small cactus, long haired freaky wet men cowering in the shower (don't get hopes up for any nudity!
this movie isn't scary or sad funny nothing this is more of a ghost story then a scary movie i wasn't scared but i wont give it a one because i thought it was good to watch there's only one or two good reviews on this i say its OK but   scary film so go rent that or this there are thousands of scary movies though more scary then this like high tension saw and much more and its nothing like the shining this is not a scary movie but if you like old like scary movies that are like this i say you rent it and wacth it and like it but if you like scary movies you can get something eles.rated pg13 for mild language
While I do understand that first it's a "Hallmark" (as in greeting cards) Production, so right there schmaltz and rubbish and that it was also a "Mini-Series", it seemed as though the producers were looking only to fill time and in a feature package... (DVD) meant for one complete viewing... it came across so God awfully long and boring.
WHY exactly does everyone fear him as though he was shedding his skin?
The most silly part is where Viktor runs after a beggar(even though the beggar is half of the creatures size and obviously human)can conveniently walk through a door and kill her without breaking a sweat.
I'll stick with the 7/10, though that's unfair given IMDb's general grade inflation.
as kids story's go,this ones no different-something happens,hero has to fix it(save/find/insert relevant problem here),has abit of trouble on way but alls OK in end-that much am pretty sure can give away without being accused of mentioning spoilers,in fact that could probably describe any child orientated film.If your kids like animated movies,this will make them happy regardless what i think.On other hand though,if they expect anything different on the animation front,they will be disappointed-most of the animation could have been done just as decent(or badly,depending on point of view,) in the 50's,in fact it looks like they may even have had that in mind intentionally when they made it for all i know.
I felt sad for the white chick (grilfriend), not because of her colour, but as a women I could relate, when you think you know somebody but and realising that you don't and in such a matter is just so painful....., but on another hand....there was that element for me, of our black brothers going for white chicks... when they are loaded....even though in this movie that wasn't what brought them together.... interesting story indeed...
Perhaps though this film, with its ALIST actors might have been better served if Newman played Hackmans part and vice versa.
Still though you have loads of alien creatures to look at and some attractive female leads.
If you want a thriller, 'who's doing it' type of film then sure this might be for you, if you want a horror though i would wait and see if Boogeyman 3 has anything decent to offer.. who knows it might actually have the Boogeyman in it this time.
Eventually he and Zakes are sucked into crime though their relationship with Nazareth (a potent Jeffrey Sekele), an angry disaffected, former ANC guerilla.
For a couple of minutes, though, it was looking pretty good.
For instance, Duchovny's character starts to have an affair even though it's so clear that he's in love with his wife.
And there's some question of whether she was having an affair too, though it seems like something was left on the editing room floor that would have explained that a little further.
It looked as though it was written and directed by Ed Wood without the props falling over.
He was excellent at the end though.
The reason I put the word "fooling" in parentheses is because the husbands are basically just sitting close to their servants and talking and playing with each other though that's enough for the wives to get suspicious.
None of these problems were the fault of Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts though, which is why I rated the film a 2 and not a 1.
In an attempt to pull in profit though they are given "ample" of screen time, a factor which encouraged a second viewing on video.
The Fisherman is cool, though.
Jennifer Esposito is good as the bartender in the karaoke bar, though it's hard not to think "She left 'Spin City' for THIS?"
In many ways, the two series were very similar, though Wong (played by Boris Karloff) was played less like a stereotypical Asian and the scripts, unfortunately, were generally not as good as the Chan scripts.
Overall, it was better than I'd feared (though certainly not the gem I'd vainly hoped for), but not by enough to lift it out of the mire of tedium.
One wonders why this movie exists, but at the same time I have to say it wasn't anywhere near laugh-out-loud terrible (though some people seem to think so).
He doesn't realize though how lucky he got.
In "Ark," her hair was long, even though they had made it clear in previous episodes that Air Force policy required her hair to be short.
Someone really screwed up though with Ann Sothern's character.
Even though new races and weapons have been added to the Warcraft series it still gets boring and annoying.
Deadwood is something altogether different, and though, by the admission of it's director, short of being an historical treatise it is nevertheless an historical perspective I have never seen before.
The cast is excellent across-the-board, though the lovely Delta Burke is way too young for the thankless role of Mrs. Claus, the prime mover of the plot in the original but reduced to looking concerned and expounding exposition here.
And overall, the movie isn't very scary (even though we're lead to believe it IS by the trailer): there's a lot of unnecessary gore, and some jump scares that once it's revealed what made you jump, you get mad at the movie for startling you for nothing.
Sure it has problems: the plot's kind of dopey, the audience is always ahead of the characters, David Schwimmer's still irritating (though oddly, in a completely way to usual) but enough of it worked to satisfy me.
And I don't like acting Even though Yuji Naka (the game creator) is the executive producer, I doubt he has much power over the American version.
This movie never gets boring even though at the end it starts to feel a little long.
The good thing about the movie though is that the story moves along quite nicely, even though there's a lot of conversation things actually do happen in it at times.
I had high hopes for it, though.
Much worse, though, is the the pointless and boring character of the movie, which is about a bunch of stupid or verbally sadistic "friends" who mostly don't like each other.
Forget Romero, this thing doesn't even manage to muster up half the entertainment value of Bill Hinzman's laughable (though oddly enjoyable) 1988 rip-off REVENGE OF THE LIVING ZOMBIES (aka FLESH EATER).
I had a lot of problems with this episode, but one thing I did like was the Spike and Buffy scene (even though I never wanted them together, esp after he turned stalker-y and built a mannequin and a sex-bot, sniffing her undies...etc) I didn't understand why the spell had to turn all potentials worldwide into all out slayers when the major battle was in the school.
Disney's "Tarzan," though regained its prestige in "Tarzan II," where they did a good job in it.
And I though, "I definitely can't watch this anymore".
By the way, it also features Liam Neeson at his most constipated, and Natasha Richardson's along for the ride too, though its hard to notice either of them while Jodie's so busy making funny faces and gurgling.
There were some good parts though, such as when they zap people with Orgazmo's working gun, (especially the dog, I got a kick out of that), and a few other scenes.
I did get a laugh out of the knife though.
Don't add this title, though.
The Latino boy didn't suck, though he played the looter.
I can't believe I wasted my time posting this, though it stinks.
Perhaps this was true of the times, but Finch's presentation (though not campy) has cartoonish leanings and nostalgic overtures that don't express anything more than what most people already realize: the cops were corrupt, the gays were not saints, and they clashed.
The guy who played Long Jhon Silver though did a great job, but the others actor where garbage, there's this guy who french accent alone is enough to make this movie a comedy.
Sadly though, I have suffered through some absolute abominations and so I actually found Blood Lake to be comparably watchable, its myriad flaws not proving as bothersome as they might.
Speaking of which, the killing doesn't start properly till 50 minutes in or so and the lighting doesn't allow for any significant nastiness, though a couple of the kills are mildly satisfying in a rock bottom kind of cheapo style.
It's as though she's trying to break the world grinning record.
Also, it seems as though he ignored the enigma of the living planet Solaris.
First of all, I'd like to establish that even though Rodney Dangerfield has top billing--he only appears in about 20 percent of the film.
Victor inherits her, along with the house, and keeps her around even though she can't cook.
Like most Hammer films, it's beautifully produced and the sets are pretty convincing (mostly) -- though I found the castle (and the film in general) to be too well-lit to be very spooky.
In the end, they arrive and are judged and sent on to their respective destinations (though conceptually, it's nothing like traditional notions of the afterlife).
While an interesting idea, the film falters not just because of the lousy payoffs for several characters, but also because the film was so stark and cheesy (though some of this can be attributed to the fact that this was such an early Talkie).
Other actors are also hammy, though they don't all reach the level that Howard does when he goes momentarily berserk.
I do have a few favourite moments in this film though...  Who can forget the ridiculous girly fight at the beginning of the film?
By the way, these same insects Â though in their normal size Â were the subject of PHASE IV (1974) as well; again, that film is superior to the one under review.
I even said to myself "I wonder how they would escape since the old couple could barely walk much less run even though they always kept within seeing distance of the others".
The things that Katie does in the film are unrealistic and downright dangerous, and the father is absolutely right in trying to stop her (though if he had have taught her how to train the horse as he did in the original, things would have turned out differently, but then society these days requires more action).
My super-favorite part, though, was at the end, when the DAD apologizes to Katy.
Initially i thought it couldn't be that bad seeing as though Steve Seagal has made 15 movies in the last 4 years, but i was wrong "DEAD" wrong.
character - not sure if its the screenplay or the acting that did that - though the screenplay should be blamed for putting them in there to begin with.
I guess this is a good movie to watch in the cinema, though only if you have someone to talk to (or more).
Journey To The Center of the Earth: I liked this, even though it had Pat Boone in it.
I didn't mind him getting snuffed though.
Personally though I have to say I did like the Wil Wheaton Molten Shower scene.
Produced by Rankin/Bass, though they've done much better.
There's an ex-boyfriend that ultimately has nothing to do with the plot, sexual 'tension' with every single woman on screen and for some reason there are a bounty of young, immensely attractive females who want to bang Al Pacino even though he honestly looks like he's about to fall into his coffin throughout the entire film.
88 Minutes is not crap though, it's less than crap.
As educational material, some states DID allow these films to be seen, though I seriously doubt that parents went to them to learn how to better raise their children!
series, even though a young child I could grasp that it was not serious.
Even though events take different turns towards the end, she still doesn't learn anything new, and the movie remains with the same shallow thought that is started out with: spend more, take risks and you'll be happier.
Even though I got to know all the actors and crew - Even though I worked up to 16 hours a day for nine weeks- Even though my name appears in the credits as a PA Even though I expected to have a biased opinion-  -I can't even watch the whole thing, this film truly sucks, and not in the good way - you know, films that are so bad, their good.
Not bad, though.
If you do, I recommend you watch the MST3k version though.
No worries this time though, because I'm keeping it short and sweet.
Besides these annoying little niggles, there's also the crappy soundtrack, the lighting that makes it appear as though the sun is going nova in every shot, and the apparent sleepiness of all of the cast members except for the dynamic but crazed Lucinda.
But even though director Tom Laughlin (of "Billy Jack" and "Master Gunfigher" fame) had previously managed to make some involving (if contrived) movies, here he couldn't pace a dramatic scene to save his life, and he definitely didn't have the know-how or the talent to make these uncharismatic actors carry the movie.
The animation was good, sometimes really good, though not nearly as good as the pre-release hype built it up to be, but the story was weak.
And when Tiuri meets the lord of the toll I got an emotional response from this performance, even though it doesn't really make sense in light of the book.
And then the locations, though well chosen, did anyone really bother to recheck them before filming??
There is big hair though and to further confirm the fact this flick was made in the 80's, has a soundtrack that was almost surely made entirely on one of those big ass sampler keyboards you used to play around with that were on display when you first walked into Sears circa 1984.
Even though the film itself deserves a 1 (or negative 7, but I can't seem to put that in).
One warning though: don't be misled by the trailers, this movie doesn't actually feature all that much "modern weaponry vs. dragons" action; it is a limited to a few short battles.
I must say, though, that Cop Rock was one of the biggest disasters in entertainment - well intentioned, well produced, but ultimately a disaster.
They move awfully slow to be scary though.
This is Japanese SciFi cult ( even though they used American actors, they STILL dubbed it...badly ) coming to you straight out of the era when cinema actually had evoluated a lot.
The script is all down hill from there, and trust me, it has to dig its way though the gravel, for it is already at the bottom of the barrel.
In which we first learn that the characters will be searching for a certain "jewel," then half way though the production, the problem is solved, and a new one then opens: a villain named Omar wishes to take over the world.
I did laugh a few times, though, but I don't think those scenes were meant to be funny.  
The plot really kills this one though as it just isn't as fun as the originals.
This movie just didn't appeal to me though like the first one...who knows; maybe I prefer jungles to desert.
Overall though the yarn leaves us relatively uninspired and lives up to its predecessor.
Humphrey Bogart was a good actor, though I am not a slavish worshiper by any means.
The world is shortly destroyed, as we learn in a drawn-out opening sequence involving an unseen narrator writing in a journal, though he doesn't seem to be writing what he's saying.
The movie has its good points, though: it is capably directed by TV veteran Rob Bowman, who at least manages to imbue the ridiculous proceedings with some sort of dramatic tension.
Wolf Kroeger's production design isn't bad, the landscape is suitably scorched and desperate, though it looks like they might have swiped some sets from "Enemy at the Gates".
Bale is all right, though his character comes off as something of a weenie.
"Balls of Fury" isn't half as funny as "Reno 911," though it does have its moments.
A few complaints though, no nothing too bad really.. just nitpicky: 1) a poor directing decision on filming parts of the dragon's eyesight perspective; this kind of technique is shabby, but luckily, it was for only 2 quick shots.
Collins looks incredibly glamorous for a woman in her early forties, but nevertheless manages to turn in one of the worst performances of her career, even though she could at times be very effective in horror films like "Tales from the Crypt".
Support is offered by Caroline Munro as a fellow stripper (though she looks far too glamorous to be playing such a lowbrow Cockney strumpet!)
Eileen Atkins triumphs as the worst cast-member though.
I suppose, though, everyone must have a benchmark 'worst movie ever' to compare all the other movies you watch to.
Sadly though it does not work as a comedy, and I have never had much time for musicals.
These would have to be the only two pluses though, in a film that is just too corny and stupid to be considered entertaining.
She previously used her breasts in "Deadly Weapons," actually smothering people to death; here, it's more standard, like garroting someone with a cord, though there's one scene involving ice cubes which is different, if still dull.
He's not at all bad here (in an badly written and implausible role), but was never able to establish himself as a serious actor, though he continued to work, showing up notably decades later in Twin Peaks.
Sadly, this film falls short, even though every actor I've seen before (especially Ms. Ng, Ms. Yau and Mr. Tsang) has impressed me with their acting ability.
I don't think most are gay ones, though.
But if you happen to have serious issues with homosexuality, you will probably NOT want to see this movie, even though it isn't about being gay in the ordinary sense.
What I don't like though is the way the movie is set up.
In the book though, he comes with Jim from Virginia.
At least my brother's videos were in English though - but then, I guess I wouldn't have stayed awake through most of this film if I didn't have to read the subtitles.
Basil Rathbone, though, is stuck with the worst role and he can't bring it to life.
I will give it 1 star for gore though.
I've seen much worse- but at least those movies had the guts to try something new (even though they tanked doing it).
What the story lacks in imagination (as it does draw upon a predictable amalgam) and coherence, it makes up for in durable performances (a likable Andrew Stevens, George Kennedy, John Lafayette, Starr Andreeff and Terri Treas all keeping it straight) and gruesomely tacky splatter (even though it doesn't have much impact in engineering the deaths and tawdry jolts).
A couple of scenes are halfway cute and some are tear jerker's, though the part of the movie I liked the best was when it ended.
The movies best line though is handled by the stereotypically oblivious and prejudice backwoods sheriff.
The presence of veterans Veronica Cartwright and Matt Clark is welcome; predictably, though, they both end up as meat for the Candyman's hook.
I think it will keep those that liked the first entertained, though they will more than likely enjoy the original far more.
For the most part this film is pretty lousy as the acting is some of the worst I've seen in a flick with a budget as large as this films' is, the scares are also somewhat predictable as well as unoriginal---however though, when I think about it now how psychotically creative (for lack of a couple of better words) could one really be with a hook anyway?
Not very I imagine---and in particular the plot itself tends to confuse the audience as it has virtually no connection to the first (which sequels really should have, though a number of them rarely do)!
I have read the comments and the summary though.
Reminded me a bit of the 1998 film "Woo" though this film was a LOT better.
The entire film is summed up in one scene halfway though the movie.
Still, though, there were a couple good scenes (the ending was surprisingly good), but just not enough to save a mediocre film.
But then I saw it again as an adult and the awful truth came out: 1) it is impossible for Steve Reeves to even try to act; 2) it is impossible for the supporting cast to act; 3) the sort of monster the argonauts face when they find the golden fleece is definitely funny (though he probably puts on the best acting of all); 4) Reeves's hairdo is unthinkable in ancient Greece; 5) any other ingredient you may think of.
It's amazing, though, how much more interesting I found Sylva Koscina this time around than I did when I was a kid.
It's possible (though highly unlikely) that I just didn't get it.
She rationalizes it in so many ways that seem artificial, and Nicky, as he does throughout the movie, gives in and listens to her, though he knows it's a bad idea.
I don't expect to be written down to, though.
Nia Long who played as Jordan Armstrong acted the part as though she lived it every second.
Annoying Relatives in the Mainstream are so awful that they must be shunned, whatever value they might contribute or pain they might alleviate in La Vie Boheme; though Poverty is the main problem in La Vie Boheme, no amount of it is sufficient to warrant such extreme measures as Reliance On Family.
There's nothing one need do to merit such consideration, other than living La Vie Boheme; the Mainstream exists purely to support La Vie Boheme, though despite this reliance, the Mainstream deserves only scorn, derision, and contempt.
I will confess I never (though I lived in NYC at the time) saw this on Broadway--and despite quite a few protests that the stage version was better, while it certainly couldn't have been WORSE, I can't imagine much improvement with those craptacular songs.
I want my $3.79 rental fee back, though.
RENT opens full throttle with the cast loudly singing to show us that they are intensely angry about something, though just what they are angry about or why they feel compelled to put it into song is never made clear.
Yamaguchi is tall, handsome and compassionate Â even though he is taunting the fleeing Allied soldiers over loudspeakers spread throughout the jungle.
Robertson is so good, though, that this can be overlooked somewhat and is forgivable.
And finally, the fact they said at the beginning this was the true sequel to the first film, even though it pales in comparison to the films that came before.
The story is OK - that's all though, "ok".
Some interesting shots but over all, very boring and empty of any substance which keeps the viewer interested......For the agricultural student, its dated because the machinery used is now obsolete, some nice seeds/crops in the film though and shots of animal husbandry are included, especially a titillating scene where a peasant babushka milks a cow.
Unbelievably, Joshua isn't the worst actor in the film - even though everyone in this movie either screams or mumbles his or her casual lines , and even though Joshua's mum looks like a crack addict psychopath during most of her scenes, the real Dung Beetle award for incompetent acting has to go to Deborah Reed.
Even though I was just a dumb kid at the time, I could still tell the difference between a good piece of film-making and and a film so bad it hurts, but what is it about the movie that makes one hurt you ask?
*********I'm ashamed to say this about such a stupid movie, but this review contains SPOILERS******************   The movie involves a family moving to a town named Nilbog (that's right it's goblin spelled backwards even though the movie is called Troll, not Goblin) and swapping houses with some hillbillies.
A romance with enough sparkling humor to have me laughing aloud though I watched the film alone.
In fact, I'd place it in the top half of his films for quality--though it still isn't that great.
Luke Moberly directs with a wink and a smile; he must have known this threadbare outing was no "Bonnie & Clyde", though he was clearly inspired by that film in visual terms, and his picture gets off to a decent start.
This unbelievably bad little piece of $hit, flick pi$$ed me off even though I only paid a dollar to rent it.
Any way you slice it though, it will come out amusing.
I will be grateful to this film for one thing though.
The overall cinematography and effects is comparable to the TV-movie work of the Pre-Battlestar Galactica Sci-Fi Channel, though the cast isn't quite as talented as the typical Sci-fi channel cast.
I give credit to the director for atleast attempting to make a semi-accurate adaptation...even though he failed miserably.
The silly grin that Short kept though out the film, really made his charactor even dumber than it was suppose to be.
Even though the cast is great and the potential is obviously there, the screenplay is overall tame and uninspired.
However, in an effort to sneak in smut, small studios created films to shock adults when they learn about terrible social ills, though they were REALLY intended to titillate and slip adult themes past the censors!
Even though they were laughably bad, they also made money due to low production costs and because they offered nudity, violence and sordid story lines--all in the name of education!
My assumption, though, is that most pot-heads just watched the film for a good laugh.
The fighting itself is alright, with some neat acrobatics, though there are clear shots where kicks do not make contact.
The directing though is a little weird, like the occasional slow motion shots that actually have little action in them, or the weird bit where about 2 minutes of screen time is devoted to choosing swimsuits and dresses for a catalogue that seems to have no relevance to the rest of the film.
The second worst element though is the plot.
The worst element though is the music, never have I actually heard music that has forced me to hit the mute button until this film; in fact, it may not be a bad idea to have mute on for the whole of the film (except perhaps for the apparently random sex scenes).
Your little daughter can make a better storyline, and though she probably isn't able to draw pictures this pretty, her tales are much more worth listening to.
Even though I went to see the movie with great expectations, I didn't like the movie at all!!.
Campy nonsense is hardly "The Manchurian Candidate", though it does have a fresh moment here and there.
Let's also get one of the hotter black stars of the era to play the "hero," too, and have him show all those corrupt politicians how it should be done, even though that "good guy."
The film gets a few stars for that alone, even though most people prefer the wise-ass Murphy.
Mostly though,it was his (clean version here) "smart-aleck"/street smart persona that made him.
Jaclyn Smith, arguably the most beautiful of Charlie's Angels--though not especially the best actress of the bunch--goes the 'abused wife' route in this undernourished made-for-TV movie.
Sometimes and with some issues we provincial Americans are wrong...in this case, however, I suspect the French have something to learn from us about the way we have taken sexual abuse cases more seriously in recent years (though, of course, we still have a way to go).
It's DBZ...like Tree of Might and The World's Strongest, it really...doesn't fit into the timeline for the show at all, though it is supposedly placed just before the beginning of the TV series.
Those who say that On the Buses wasn't bad because it was popular should remember that Baywatch was once the most popular programme in the world - though even Baywatch wasn't as embarrassingly awful as this.
He seems a bit unsure of himself with his line delivery, and looks, at times, as though he's trying too hard, and at others, like he's not trying hard enough.
Bernard Lloyd's appearance as The Ghost Of Jacob Marley is acceptable, though only due to some late-90s special effects.
Confessions does have some positive points though.
The music isn't too bad, even though they may have overused the "Uh-Oh" song by putting it in three different scenes.
I think the book might be a little better though.
Linsey's character was so OTT that it looked as though she had ignored the director and decided to improvise her role.
The ending is also pretty bad since it randomly ends with Lohan kissing Sam even though they hardly focused on this romantic subplot.
I though this was quite a good film to watch although i did not find a lot happening in the film.
Indeed Bruce Li looks like Bruce Lee and manages to do some impressive moves (though we can't fully enjoy it, as we can't see what's going on) but the movie is lethargically paced, the action badly shot and of course no momentum develops between the action, so what were left with is a boring kung fu movie with better than average production values but nothing worthwhile to watch.
Willem Dafoe gives a decent performance though he isn't given very much screen time.
Cube is expressionless, for the most part, and the action becomes pretty ridiculous and Bond-like even though we're dealing with too close to home locations like the Capitol building and people being involved like the President of our good-old United States of America.
The supporting players just seem to be along for the ride and don't add much even though they include a few talented people like Samuel L. Jackson, Willem Dafoe, and Scott Speedman(who was great in the Underworld movies but is horrible here).
What is NOT beside the point though is the fact that "xXx: State of the Union" employs the same method of action filming as many other Hollywood-movies of late.
So even though i can't say i really enjoyed this movie it was never boring, there is always something happening on screen.
It's still a lot better than the first movie though.
People who like to see a plot and at least some traces of logic might want to stay away though.
Samuel L Jackson cashes in his paycheck and plods through the movie looking as though he just read the script and realized what he has got himself involved in.
On the sort of plus side, there was a thread of tension running through the movie and an atmosphere reminiscent of Todd Haynes's "Safe", though with none of the commitment of that movie.
For me though it is a contrived distraction that is unable to save this turgid Chabrol like (I apologize for being redundant.
So even though a cast this good promises something epic, it hardly delivers.
Veteran director Benny Chan (A MOMENT OF ROMANCE, NEW POLICE STORY) marshals proceedings into a cohesive whole, though the movie fizzles badly after a dynamic opening sequence before rallying again somewhere around the halfway mark.
Few of the actors emerge with any credit, though Nakamura is admirably solemn as an English-speaking Japanese villain who clings to old-fashioned notions of truth and righteousness in a world where such virtues no longer have currency.
There is nothing good to write except maybe for the eyes of the co-star female actor....Even though at the beginning shows promising the rest is for the garbage...
To be fair Gregory Christian was not the only bad thing that happened to this movie (all though he happened a lot) the other two principal actors are not much better although James Michael Bobby compensates greatly for lack of acting skills by his very good looks and sexy/charming smile!
Clearly though, James Michael Bobby was the absolute saving grace in what would have been an otherwise dire and unwatchable movie.
I don't recall the English losing a single ship, and the Spanish only a few-and though the fire ships will wreak havoc on the Armada, it will come about as they travel home-not as in the film in a giant conflagration.
Christians believe it all to be true though they can if they want.
I will just state this though, when it's their time to die and I hope thats soon cause their stupid asses shouldn't be shown on TV anymore they will find out that our consciousness survives bodily death everything unexplainable in this world points towards it.
It was as though there was a camera crew commissioned to shoot some footage and then it was thrown together in a hurry.
The challenge of a filmmaker here is that either you properly understand the philosopher, or you may potentially embarrass yourself, though, for the audience, either way could be interesting.
It is as though the video makers were simply in awe of the fact that the man lives!
I often wish that someone would attempt a version that is truer to the original book, even though it was penny-dreadful claptrap.
That said though - I admire their independent spirit and go get it attitude - and wish them well!
They've convinced me though.
Robot Wars has a lot of unintentional laughs in it though.
I would imagine that seeing them as a double feature at a drive-in might have made for a very entertaining though somewhat grueling night.
One or all of these specialties have allowed the professor to create a device which now threatens to destroy a fairly large city back on earth, and the professor and his really annoying though apparently brilliant research assistant are charged with the task of creating artificial life for the Brian Joneses' masters, an aging race of paraplegic immortals.
The acting was often awkward and felt unrealistic even though the style of film-making was cinema-verite.
Anthony Hopkins and Richard Dreyfuss perform well, though.
The characterization is paper-thin, though that is perhaps understandable given the number of characters.
These three movies take 4 1/2 hours (collectively) to get to the point, and they force the audience to re-hash story lines which had been fully fleshed out in the original series (though sometimes with slightly different characters.)
He really was a "boy "General" in the Civil War and even though most West Point Grads who were like Custer, in the right place at the right time for promotions; his rise in rank was phenomenal.
Even though the X's and nanny comes to make you tired while reading, that would have allowed an excellent adaptation: shorter but consistent with the humor of the book.
And though I cannot recommend this movie I do recommend the book to anyone.
SECRETS has an entirely different feel to it , in many ways it feels neither like a cynical marketing excersise nor a feature film but more like a theater play , and even though I haven`t bothered to check I`m probably right in saying SECRETS started life off as a play .
Don't expect typical Hitchcock touches in this early silent of his called Easy Virture since this isn't even a suspense film but more of a melodrama about a divorced woman who can't escape her past, a past in which her then-husband discovered her painter's infatuation with her, which he mistakes for an affair, and gets shot by him but survives though the painter later commits suicide (which I wouldn't have known about if I hadn't read the synopsis on the DVD case back).
The most notable cast member is Ian Hunter, though leading lady Isabel Jeans did go on to play prominent roles in GIGI (1958) and HEAVENS ABOVE!
Now, even though its dancing zombies are timeless, it must loose its crown.
The only shows I like are Lost and 24, even though they aren't Christian.
And any series that casts John Rhys-Davies and fails to turn his entertaining pompousness to advantage is beyond hope; though you have to give them credit for casting Christopher Biggins as a Cardinal.
Besides, he's obviously portraying the smartest character of the bunch (even though that role should be Pullman's), so it's hard not to root for him to beat all the idiots.
An X-ray, blood test, or any number of medical procedures would quickly disclose their less than human nature, however a simple test was just to take a pulse which would give the appearance that they were dead even though they were fully conscious and ambulatory.
I would tell you the ending but technically that would be a spoiler - though nothing could really spoil this cookie cutter predictable attempt.
People went out to cuddle even though they knew, that their friends were missing.
Though Robert Houston (Bobby) is also on hand, his character is conveniently put out of the way at the very beginning: he freaks out when a motor race is set to take place in the desert near where his family was attacked all those years ago and opts to stay behind Â Ruby (who's even changed her name) and Beast, however, go along and, though the former's confession about her past isn't taken very seriously by her companions, both of course prove instrumental in the new victims' safe-keeping.
Incidentally, Craven knew when he had a good thing going and, so, reproduced here two death methods from the original Â Berryman himself, in fact, expires yet again at the hands of Beast (though he's met with the fate that had previously befallen his brother Mercury), while The Reaper's come-uppance is an even more elaborate and protracted stunt than Jupiter's demise in the 1977 film and which would have been more appropriate for a Road Runner cartoon!
That didn't turn out to matter though, because nearly the entire contents of the first film have been conveniently spliced in to this flick.
One character is blind though you won't know it until she actually says so as she is so poorly written and unconvincingly acted.
There is also a scene where she is running through a cabin, note: a cabin she has never been to in her whole life yet she runs through the house as though it is her very own home Â blindness can mean second sight with senses perhaps, but not the way this movie does it; it just looks silly, as I said, its poorly written.
Not only the lack of character explanations but these new characters are simply put; murder dolls Â as I said, this is Friday the 13th though the only problem in saying that is that these teenagers don't have sex, smoke drugs, drink alcohol, be naked Â nothing.
The non-horror viewing public slander horror films as predictable, cheesy and stupid however there are a lot of horror films out there that prove such a statement false Â though The Hills Have Eyes part 2 not only encourages the "all horror movies are dumb" idea but takes it ten steps further.
Michael Berryman is still good as Pluto (though the character is nowhere near as scary as he was in the first film).
If you're a fan of slasher films, then this is fairly entertaining - though maybe for the wrong reasons.
That didn't turn out to matter though, because nearly the entire contents of the first film have been conveniently spliced in to this flick.
Cast is nothing special at all, though it is amusing to see Penny Johnson (Jerald), recently of the TV series '24' (she played Sherry Palmer), paying some serious dues, and to see Janus Blythe reprise her role from the first film.
It was only when Melody stopped wishing and actually did something that all the pieces fell into place: like going to that swanky restaurant even though she had no escort, and joining in the fun with the other diners.
And, for the record, I still watch 'It's A Wonderful Life', though many have gotten sick of it, sad to say.
The plot did mature a lot, though.
It's all much better to watch when you're a kid, though.
It's all very arty, though unfortunately the artiness isn't used in the best way possible.
That's okay, though.
The film even manages to produce some exciting scenes though they are few and far in between.
Paul Bettany plays the villain and he gives a good performance even though his character is a little weak and not very scary.
This movie had all of the makings of a great movie....the beginning action pulls you in, interesting plot....you relate to Harrison Ford's character and his surroundings asap...the villains are unlikeable heavy's...then mid way through the movie, the pace of the film changes and comes across as something that seemed as though it was being added to as the movie was made..or not enough was deleted and cut out of the film...in some cases, the "Jack Ryan" and "Fugitive" resemblances start peeking in...but Harrison Ford is such a great actor,you cannot help but like his ability to play anger and frustration...and this movie plays on that...
Most miscast though is the young and aloof secretary, a "Tess Trueheart," who looks like someone peed in her cornflakes in almost every scene she's in.
One would have to be the biggest computer geek going to understand even half of what the characters are doing at any given time in this film, though it scarcely matters since the story itself is so distressingly hackneyed that one is already watching the screen with an eye half-cocked to one's watch anyway.
The son tries to remove it and the mom tells him not to - even though they are held captive in their own home and I'm not sure how the dog would run away to need a GPS tracker anyway.
Largely well acted and Holmes is much prettier than the the usual cast of such fare though her main erotic scene is a long way coming - largely due to the fact that all her friends have to recount their own sexual adventures and escapades in order to get her in the mood.
I don't know how I did though.
I was greatly disappointed in this film after being greatly impressed by the powerful and moving "Way Down East" and the groundbreaking (though shockingly racist) "Birth of a Nation."
It seems as though the filmmakers were too busy adding as many special effects shot and characters as possible from the videogame, rather than worrying about any type of story or character development.
And Brian Thompson, even though a credible screen bad guy, is no Tagawa.
Leonetti certainly does a lot with special effects but they just don't look very good (Motaro was pretty well done though).
Bad guy suddenly comes back, even though MK1 stated it was over and done with.
Even the soundtrack was not as good as the first movie even though KMFDM were involved in both.
So I was like..."Damn, this is a glorified power rangers..." I could see from the start it was, when Raiden fires lighting at the beginning, it looks as though someone has put a giant bitmap overlaid onto the movie and moved it around a bit.
And though he created these wonderful characters, it was not his idea to 'kill them off' by showing their obituaries in a future-tense sequence; another writer from the show formed that concept.
This mystery snow does not effect the trees though, they don't move?
I saw it for the first time not too long ago, and I must say I was somewhat disappointed, though my judgment is biased.
Or one where the military so predictably wants to blow up the thing-we-don't-understand with a nuke ordered by a panicked President even though the resident scientist (who's of course a totally smug jerk) says not to.
I don't see why anyone would go out and buy this, though.
The film's worst crime, though, is the constant hippie jokes.
The title, salacious though it is, is pretty accurate, but the predictable tale plods along and in the end produces a killer we have not only not seen but did not know existed!
High point includes fighting in zero gravity and when everyone is killed when the airlock opens (just kidding, though wish it happened).
It obviously won't stand comparisons with the likes of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968), though still valuable for being one of the very first films to exploit the 1969 landing on the moon.
Having said that, It's undeniably superior to ZETA ONE (1969), which I watched recently, though still containing a definite camp factor Â starting with the goofy animated credit sequence (accompanied by a decidedly infectious title tune) but extending to hilarious costumes and propsÂnot to mention the presence of a dapper megalomaniac villain (by the way, as was the case with ZETA ONE itself, the cast features a member of the "Carry On" gang in Bernard Bresslaw, again, appearing as a baddie albeit a dimwitted brute!).
It's interesting, though, that co-star Adrienne Corri would appear in Hammer's more traditional VAMPIRE CIRCUS (though still contriving a twist in its tail) and Kubrick's subsequent piece of sophisticated sci-fi, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, within the same year (1971).
Thinking real hard about it I might have had one of the toys though, not knowing what it was called, but I'm not quite sure.
Even though I do think the main guy is good at acting like a slimeball, the story is not very exciting.
One knows one is in further trouble when there is not one single note of Mancini music in the film, even though he receives credit for Original Music.
Karen Black looked remarkably old even though this is one of her earliest films.
And Christopher Plummer is fine as usual - though he is definitely not performing Shakespeare, but a rather aphasic, gum chewing and cheaply dressed police inspector.
I usually am extremely understanding towards Christopher Plummer's professional choices in the movie sector: though I think he has wasted his unique acting talent starring in too many mediocre movies, I understand that everyone has to earn a living.
Its plot does hang together, despite the seemingly unavoidable red herrings, though the killer's motivation ultimately proves to be unconvincing (don't even try guessing who the killer is!).
There are any number of genuinely suspenseful scenes, though, and the soundtrack, by one Berto Pisano, effectively mixes Euro lounge jazz with a funky theme that suggests the Temps' "Papa Was a Rolling Stone."
One thing stood out though... Stacey, the office birthday girl.
Even if there is nothing else on TV, don't waste your time - turn it off and listen to the radio - go for a walk - play a game - read a book - anything is preferable to suffering though this abomination!
Yep, for some characters--some extras, especially the kids, seemed to be smiling with delight rather than wincing in terror, but hey, they are kids (the little girl who played Sofia was quite real, though.
The adult extras and some small roles though, no excuse for them.
A poor storyline, a rubbish script, and another low budget film where everything goes well for the good, and the bad get punished or learn a "valuable" lesson (even though really it was the leading female characters fault for closing down the research in the first place).
Her estranged boyfriend though, another scientist, is another matter.
The actual climax (as well as the murderer's fate) is regretfully weak, though.
As soon as Eileen joins my party though: ruined.
The performances are generally good, though I thought combining over-the-top caricatures with low-key realism made for a confusing mix.
I don't mean the major plot point, about the mars mission, but rather an accumulation of little details that just seemed totally unrealistic even though I was able to buy the overall idea of the movie.
Add to all of that a really awful ending that seemed as though the writers just hit a deadline and tacked something on, which also features some totally egregious slow-motion shots (cut back and forth with regular-speed shots!
If you like honest camp, though, you might find it fun.
It is unfortunate that Hollywood quickly lost interest in the complexity of producing good stereoscopic films (which are most often now featured in specialist theatres such as the IMAX), and instead has followed what I feel has been a largely disasterous attempt to explore the potential of anthropomorphic lenses even though in the majority of cases these have no conceivable artistic contribution to make to the final product.
He's still cool though.
The acting was pretty good (loved Margot Kidder's portrayal of Bobby's mother) though some of the characters were rather transparent.
As educational material, some states DID allow these films to be seen, though I seriously doubt that parents went to them to learn how to better raise their children!
There has not been a comeback for the action star though.
You have to wonder though just whether his recent career track record shows that big name directors no longer want to work with him.
All in all this is ideal for rental, though certainly you wouldn't be ashamed to own it on DVD.
Wesley needs to step up his career; I'm fighting this fight with Wesley Snipes though, but I don't know how long this fight is going to last.
He does get to do some karate kicks and yelling, though.
However, even though it's a horrible scene, just get a load of that old lady as she watches the attack!
In a "Bevis and Butthead" sort of way, I suppose most people might smile when they first see the diminutive actors and actresses riding tiny ponies and acting like "normal" Western actors--though this enjoyment is a bit unsettling when you think about it!
What was worse than this, though, was one of several musical numbers which was sung by a cabaret singer in a bar.
Hopefully, though, most - if not all - of these tiny thespians a year later were able to say that they had a little (not another pun) part in the much worthier Wizard of Oz; not The Terror of Tiny Town.
A couple questions need answering though.
I think the actors performed with all seriousness in their roles, even though it seems to me that the script was poking fun at them, having them ride miniature ponies (which is hilarious to see) and having them walk under normal size barroom doors and the like.
I will give him an A for his effort, though wasted it was.
I though this was a movie that I would just have to say was "over my head" - the laughs must come from the clever juxtapositions between various things written by these three men and what I was seeing.
The few things I liked are the women attraction: the younger one is very attractive, the actress and dancer are too, though it's partly because of their awkward detached personalities.
Not anymore, though.
he's given plenty of help by the amateur Italian movies who appear here, though.
The Great American Snuff Film seems to be a ultra serious attempt to get into the mind of a sick f*ck like Grone as it almost relies totally on his constant tedious & clichÃ©d monologues for it's narrative even though not much happens anyway.
She should be a role model for pretty girls though.
And even though I have called this a sequel (for ease of writing) I do not recognise it as such.
As far as I am concerned we left the world of Bateman in the novel when the final page was turned (even though I never read it properly), and in the film when the end credits began rolling.
I had my doubts about this even before it saw release, but my assumptions turned out correct--I masochistically sat through this idiotic mess, even though I felt compelled to turn it off at least once every five minutes.
This man has to be on the FBI's "priority watch" list(s)...the girls WERE hot though...
It does have the "Nightmare on Elm St." thing going on though with trying to stay awake or having someone watch you so they can wake you up if the dream gets too bad.
As a film though its awfully generic and extremely derived.
He picks a lady who has nothing to do with the movie industry and blindly listens to everything she says even though she has no idea what she's talking about.
I observed a BAD Humphrey Bogart recently that actually had a much higher percentage of scores of 10 than CASABLANCA--even though the overall score was still quite low.
On the bright side, effects were solid, Ivonova still rocks, and the audio commentary was fun to listen to even though not enlightening.
I guess I kinda like the title though...
Then to solve all the problems... it was made possible sending him to the past... well i can't comment on that, i'll just assume it as a possibility in movie's reality, though it would be kind of impossible to imagine it after so much trouble sending the mass of little sheet of paper.
I had expected more out of this film, it had a few things that kept me interested though; it had that Tobe Hooper quality and strangeness that he happens to manage in most if his films.
I did not expect this film to take place entirely on a stage setting though.
For sheer entertainment and an intriguing (though not flawless) plot, Bruckheimer, Scott and Co. sure have DELIVERED the goods.
They namecheck Doctor Dre though, that counted as a highlight.
I can promise you that both you and your family/significant others will be blow though the very back wall of the theater.
And I almost burst out laughing when Seth said "red... COLOR" after he became human even though the whole film was shot in color and nothing hinted that he couldn't see colors.
It was as though someone got to lazy too shoot the rest of the movie.
Fact is though, that Ms. Vardalos can't act, even if her life depended on it.
Even though Ridley gets the accolades and Tony gets the hack/overproduced label, I must say, while they are the best directing duo in Hollywood, I might have to give the edge on pure cinematic entertainment to the younger Tony.
With cinematography by frequent Pedro AlmodÃ³var collaborator JosÃ© Luis Alcaine, the Greek locations are refreshing, even though the environs around Valencia, Spain, apparently doubled for much of the country.
Even though Vardalos is not at the helm this time (unlike the far more execrable "I Hate Valentine's Day" released a month later), I have a feeling that she has more talent than this movie allows her to display.
Also Jason brutally murders his male victims though not so brutal with females Why?
On the positive side there were some nice boobs and nudity in the film, and it was at least better executed (no pun intended) than parts 6 thru 10 (though 10 story wise is probably more entertaining).
Danielle Pannabaker tripped through the movie with a slack look on her face the whole time as though she was bored to be there.
Even though I thought his kills fell short.
Aside from the three leads (Jenna, Whitney, Clay), I cringed at most of the one-dimensional, obnoxious characters, even though the acting were fine.
It's more of a remake of F12 Part 3, than Part 1 or Part 2 though there are parts of both in it.
(Slight spoilers, though nothing major.
A couple good touches, such as the topless skiing scene (even though that didn't show off what it could've) and the ax kill (now THAT was pure Jason) can even begin to save this pile of sludge.
The black guy had a slight variation though since he's black.
And Jared Padalecki (though one of the better actors here) would probably look better without the Farrah Fawcett hairdo.
Give these folks a hand though.
Even though 'The 9th Gate' was not the right adaptation from the 'El club Dumas', from the same author, Arturo PÃ©rez-Reverte, it is a good film, making the fans of a good thriller eager for a much better work in what concerns 'LA TABLA DE FlANDES', stating yet that it's very easy not to drift from the book, while make a new movie...
Even though the story line is a little predictable, the actors made it fun to watch.
This episode though is just boring.
I feel sorry for the actors who worked in this.. though they must have realized as their characters were all so pathetic.
So, even though I didn't like it much, I'm glad movies are still being made that a kid can watch and get lost in.
The fact is, the movie seemed as though it's purpose was to show Joan as a mentally unstable kid who didn't even take part in the battles and fighting which have made her famous.
"Hysteria" is a modern and plausible explanation for religious visions, but there is no historical evidence to serve as background -- and I found the modern day psycho-babble more than a little jarring, even though Dustin Hoffman does his best with the role.
It interesting though how the story also tries to balance itself by introducing new ideas on what is and is not divine and even this element was clumsily and randomly introduce as plot elements, from Faye Dunaway's character fumbling with the vile of "blood" to Joan herself seeing "visions" Dustin Hoffman's performance was fair but totally unnecessary the film could have limped on without him.
Acting wise: Molly Shannon is the only actor who does her part well, while all the others try hard, though some manage.
It is especially bad when anyone has to act as though experiencing extreme emotion, as during Richard's ordeal.
Now, even though they most likely couldn't afford a special effects shot to show a dissolve from the drawing to the door opening, they could have easily made the door they built resemble the one Richard drew.
None of them do a very good job of it, though the odds are that half of it is more the fault of the director than it is their own.
Even though the idea is interesting (a society where the Gays are the majority and the straights are the exception), the implementation of this subject on the movie was awful.
Even though the lizard and actors never shared the screen, it supposedly stalked its victims amongst the scrubs, in which they had no idea they were being prayed upon.
There's no nudity, no gore and it's not really scary at all (the sci-fi eerie music is kind of nice, though).
I would put this one in the second category, though it is a bit duller than some of the cheesy old horror films from the 1950s.
But to make things worse, even though many people have just died, the lead actor begins to sing (a la Arch Hall, Jr. in EEGAH!)!
Except for those two, though, this movie seems to have terminated the brief careers of every other actor associated with it, including Don Sullivan.
Ryoko (Miyamoto Nobuko) and Gondo (Yamazaki Tsutomu) are of course the dueling protagonists, but each is anti-heroic, something I ordinarily can't stand: Gondo is the operator of a chain of Japan's ubiquitous "Love Hotels," where lovers go to find short-term lodgings for their trysts, who's got a complex system in place to evade Japan's horrific taxation; Ryoko is a tax auditor, later promoted to investigator, who, though admirable in her relentless dedication and competence, is party to some of the most horrendous legal assaults on businesspeople imaginable.
The fairly simple plot setup in "A Taxing Woman" derives its incredible depth by the fact that it's almost entirely character-driven - Miyamoto and Yamazaki are such vivid personalities and the opposing chemistry between them so potent that you will find yourself thinking about them for weeks after the fact, as though they were your close personal friends.
A dose of gritty realism - though with a patina of humor as well - is added to the mix in the character of the violent Yakuza boss Ninagawa, played by Ashida Shinsuke.
Well, that's not exactly true because even though the film initially had me rolling my eyes over and over, by the end I was actually quite enjoying the movie, as shallow as it may be.
Possession as a novel is fun, but seriously flawed--When transferred to the screen by an underwhelming cast and crew, though, those flaws become insurmountable obstacles.
Both are good actors (Paltrow won an Oscar, though undeservedly, and judging by Eckhart's climb to fame and versatility, it's only a matter of time before he gets a statue), but they have no chemistry.
Randy's most heroic struggle though is with his wealthy father(Charles Shaughnessy), when he falls in love with Hallie(Stacey Dash).
Apart from this, Zombie Dead has little plot and atmosphere, though there are some relatively Gory scenes to make up for this.
The actors, though below average at best, at least seem into it and not embarrassed.
I will admit, though, that Cher's new boyfriend did make me laugh.
Group encounter living threat that wants to kill them all for no real reason at all, group run low on ammo even though they never actually run out & have to come up with other ways to defeat their enemy in a nail-biting (not) climax, been done yeah?
Off track though, down to brass tax, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, deviants of all ages, this is Cindy and Donna, by far the most pornographic of the 2-disc 8-movie set of "Drive-in Cult Classics" released thanks to Crown Entertainment.
I had a lot of fun trying to be the whining, miserable wife for the movie, even though in real life I am nothing like that character.
It's not evident that it has anything to do with a mastery of film-making, though; to the contrary, I think that's absent.
The character's too annoying, though Gartin does get off some good lines.
I got to see this movie for free and I still feel as though I have been cheated.
The writing is non existent and the film constantly runs along as though it was made in the same chronological fashion as the diary format it is narrated in.
It was made by the TV animation studio and it kind of has that look and feel to it with it's incomplete, un-realistic backgrounds but otherwise looks OK. Robin Williams as the Genie is funny at times(but overbearing at others)and some of the other minor characters brings some laughs but the movie tries to be too grand and too good even though it wasn't meant to be.
actually i think why i don't remember the end is because i fast forwarded to the end, i do that sometimes, so i can say i've seen a film but i don't have to actually sit and watch the whole thing, i usually get the gist though.
i always feel a little guilty when i do it though.
Midway though the film, for what seems like 20-30 minutes, there are passages of dialogue and voice-over narration that are accompanied by the actors talking, or mouthing words since you can't actually hear them--you can only hear the voiceovers.
Even though he must outweigh her by 150lbs she beats him and in more than one scene she gets the best of him.
Caught this tonight on cable and have to say it surprised me - didn't figure out what was really going on, even though I knew that what was being shown wasn't the entire story, and I have seen so many films like this, where what you see isn't exactly what you get, where you can't take anything at face value, so it shouldn't have fooled me.
Listen, though.
Even though mom arrived minutes after the tornado hit (and had to evade a police roadblock to do so) the daughter -- who had, by the way, ignored an earlier cellphone message from weather-guru mom warning of the impending twister -- tears a strip off mom, apparently for not being there with her while the school was being torn apart ("Where were you?
OK this is the 2nd appearance of The Pink Panther even though there were several other titles with that name it has nothing to do with it it was only in for a cameo where someone steals it and Cluesau is kidnapped (after the abomination of the first one I'm celebrating) and some journalist asks questions about Cluesau (Cluesau isn't in this one only in Archive Footage I know a complete ripoff even though so was the rest of the series) and they ask even Charles the real "Phantom" makes an appearance we see Clueseau's childhood and all this other crap which has nothing to do with anything if the journalist was really an author writing bio's about detectives who are so stupid it isn't funny (the only other thing in that category is FAMILY GUY) OK Clueseau isn't found.
It started interestingly though, but Edwards used all his material with Sellers too soon and stretched the movie endlessly.
The first half which Sellers is in excels (even though one can easily tell that all his scenes are just deleted scenes), but once he's gone, every goes downhill.
Not everything's bad, though.
It's also confusing to see some sequences that were obviously meant original for mainly "The Pink Panther Strikes Again" and "Revenge of the Pink Panther" incorporated into this movie as part of the story but however these different sequences obviously don't really connect with each other also because most of those sequences are basically the same, though less good, ones that got eventually used in those earlier mentioned movies.
The only good thing about this movie is that for guys and girls it has some good eye candy in it, though, most of which i wish would disappear, as far as the movie is concerned, the special effects as sh*t, Dante?
The plot is good and has a lot of depth, but I think it has some minor flaws (no big deal, though).
And when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, though nothing great.
What actually happened though was that Jason Palmer did the original make-up for the Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and re-shoot much of the creature.
For some reason, there is a whole character--Mary Mancini--left in the script even though she's superfluous.
For some reason we suddenly go to a extremely soft-core porno scene, even though the motif is never repeated again.
For some reason, Quastel insists on using the "Blurry Cam" and "Distorto-Cam" for the monster attack scenes, even though the costume doesn't look that bad, and it would have been much more effective to put in some fog, a subtle filter, or anything else other than bad cinematography.
"Married to the Mob" with Michelle Pfeiffer was better, and though her accent was off, at least she can act, unlike Tripplehorn.
For most viewers though, this would prove to be a cheesy example of an era that might be better off forgotten.
Even though I went into this film with very low expectations - they weren't met.
This is no bed-in with John and Yoko though.
While Pinhead's greater presence in this one than in the last is a welcome change, the Hellraiser movies were never originally about him or the Cenobites, even though they seemed to have evolved in that direction, which, with proper directing and writing, could have been a good thing.
)It's not to be blamed all on the actors, though.
Warning to the die-hard fan, your nit-picking will be far worse than this general, though wordy, comment (such as Pinhead's costume, if you're very observant, you'll know what I'm talking about).
Come on, 1 and 2 are classics, 3 was average, 4 (though it got terrible reviews) was kinda fun, 5 was depressing but smart, but this: I can hardly describe this mess.
The challenge in accepting Sandler's performance is not his attempt to be taken seriously as Oscar-bait, but rather his apparently limited ability to convey the complexity underneath what seems to be the perfect man - understanding, compassionate (though too passive at key moments of conflict), a loving father.
The character, however, is idealized at the expense of presenting a figure as complex as the Claskys, especially as the story veers into the inevitable though not terribly credible attraction that develops between Flor and John.
In the end, we are expected to believe that Flor is too virtuous to have any personal desires, though there is still something resolutely selfish about pulling her daughter out of the scholarship-funded private school.
And finally in a good role again, Cloris Leachman displays her considerable skill in playing Deborah's alcoholic though self-aware mother, Evelyn, who tosses the best line to her daughter: "Your low self-esteem is simple common sense, dear."
The negatives, though, far outweigh the positives.
Even though the film might scare some people because it is composed of only pictures and dialog.
and find an old movie and watch it even though you know it's bad.
Maybe the small insert of real music by Gene Rodgers is enough to search for that scene (about 9:40 in), where he plays a nice stride or similar style piano, though probably not miked while filming, since the fingerwork doesn't match up.
What a shocker, I rented this movie on the basis of the DVD cover and the summary of the story, it seemed like it would be something I could watch (though I don't as a rule enjoy Westerns) with my partner, (who loves Westerns!!)
In fact it felt as though I had been up all night.
This movie is more meant to disturb you than gross you out.I did have two problems with the movie,though.
Brave as though the Hughes boys were to move into a new field of film making, for the most part the film is never terribly interesting to look at and worse, often treats the viewer as an idiot by showing us close ups and reminders of things that happened moments ago.
As its release date neared, though, and details of the film began to leak out, I became distressed by the broad changes the film's writers had made to Moore's original story, apparently with the consent of the Hugheses.
From Hell is like Dead Presidents (which is better, though itÂ´s still pretty bad): graphic violence and thatÂ´s it.
Johnny Depp's accent couldn't be anymore silly than it was even though I would give him a little happy by saying nice try there.
One suspected his heart was not really in this hotly steaming turd and he just went through the paces playing the exact same role as he did in "Sleepy Hollow," which, though it also had a tired old plot, still turned into a great movie.
(Depp was OK though, his being mellow and not seemingly screeched at the top of his lungs like the "unfortunates" was.)
The plot development on the other hand was acceptable, though derivative.
Richard Boone has a number of gunmen working for him, but it's never apparent any of them are wanted for anything, though they should be.
Even though Gordon and Boone's other men are clearly unreliable witnesses and Homier is known not to carry a gun, the sheriff arrests Homier.
A talking, Scottish-accented police dog (though he won't speak to grown ups) and his British owner (what are they doing so far from home?)
But the moment a movie show something terrifying that could be real, it's scary.Even though this is a more graphic film, the influences from Psycho and Night of the Living Dead are visible.
The sad thing about this though is that not many people saw this film that are a part of the new generation, except they saw the new version of the film and refuse to see this masterpiece because it's old even though to this reviewer, this film is without a doubt a timeless masterpiece that will never be topped no matter how hard anyone tries.
Perhaps the major mistake was to have so much of it take place in the future (though, I would genuinely miss the sensitive, ironic and witty performance of Robert Joy as Cheryl Ladd's personal robot), if it weren't.
It's still probably 1 star more than it deserved, though.
Clearly there was something in in the mix that made Ms Fletcher take the role, though it might have been only money.
The tearjerking that tugged though was uniquely caused by suppressed hilarity - when I wasn't yawning, that is.
The clothing looked as though it was from the 60s not the 50's.
The music, though good, seemed to be inserted as just a device to try to save a bad movie.
It quite seriously looked like a high school class project, though the actors were a bit too old to expect in to be in a high school class project, the script and dialog were rank, and it was delivered about as poorly as it was written.
Isabelle only has about fifteen lines, though.
Other fans of the original seem to like this movie, but I can't help but see it as a major disappointment, though not a disaster.
Don't think for a second that adds to its credit, though.
But the hero has one flaw, he's an agnostic, even though he was brought up in a Catholic family.
Too bad that it's senselessly penned with an messy same-old, same old structure (even though the concept showed more promise than your copy-and-paste 'Ringu' clone) of cheap jolts, typical thrills (that steals its thunder from other films) and lazily constructed characters.
I will give 'The Park' credit for two things though: More proof that clowns are evil, and the fact that we have very little (to no) character development.
Whatever masochism allows "fans" to laugh at her in the same "at least my friends and I are not THAT bad" - or worse, though it's difficult to believe - "see, I'm *normal*" mode many looked at Archie Bunker with through the years of ALL IN THE FAMILY escapes me.
Also, I enjoyed Pecker's older sister more than Selma Blair's character (the huge boobs were a great touch though).
Even though the film begins promising, it completely fails and falls in level afterwards.
At least he's pretty though, right?
Maybe I just haven't kept with the time and it's the new humor that I don't get, even though I'm only 20 years old.
But the direction by Tobe Hooper is inspired brilliance and even though Hooper often injected bits of black humor here and there which could have made the film less authentic, the humor never overtakes the story (which is probably what many didn't like about the sequel, which, btw, I recommend too) because the rawness of what's occurs on screen is never pulled back.
Even though the budget was almost next to nothing and the conditions of making the movie were, according to many articles, hellish, the film doesn't have one weak element.
Ryan grew up planning his whole life perfectly even though he was a geek through out high school, dated a fellow geek played by Alyson Hannigan and yet for some strange reason the most popular girl in his school Jennifer always seemed to be around him all the time.
In the end though, very predictable, Ryan and Jennifer end up on the Italy plane together, and they do accept they love each other, while Hunter (in a small subplot) finds his perfect girl with Jennifer's friend Amy (Final Destination's Amanda Detmer).
Even though all she does is scream and plead for her life, she does so with such energy and realism that it is difficult to watch her.
It also shows that even though Disney is making shorts again, they're still sentimental fluff on topics the maker's don't really know that much about.
On the upside though, it does try to set a positive agenda in contrast to for instance Michael Moore's eternal gloom.
I rate it 4/10 as it wasn't a total disaster as a political statement (though a bit boring and quite predictable) but neither was it good journalist/documentarist craftsmanship
It wasn't with me though.
Even though we don't see it; it's obvious that they have frequently ridiculed him(His reaction in the abandoned house to their laughter best reveals this, as he can't stand to hear their mocking laughter even if it is not directed at him and he knows it).
Give Mattei credit, though--he had the cajones to make a sequel, as well.
As the first of its kind, this movie set the mold for the modern horror film, though none were ever to realize any comparable distinction.
Even though the actors are believable in their personification of homosexuals, they are simply not convincing when it comes to human emotion.
I was looking forward to watching it, even though I have grown wary of British films with the 'classic' tag attached.
I didn't feel that way at first, though.
There must be a story in the fact that this film though completed in 1950 was not released until 1957.
Even hard core Duke Wayne fans should pass on Jet Pilot, it's a flameout; The Hunters will fire your afterburner (even though F-86s didn't have afterburners...)
The plot seems as though it was made up as they went along (on a few occasions, I thought a reel must be missing) and I don't think I'm giving anything away (like there was any suspense anyway) by saying John Wayne must really love Janet Leigh to stay with her after she pistol whips him.
All of the other actors in the film have a wooden presentation, as though they brought in actual air force officers to appear in the film.
Not once does she even give the least hint of a Russian accent, though through the use of very thick sweaters she DOES appear to be the poster girl for Playboy Magazine.
Here in this film, they had difficulty delivering their lines convincingly, though you really can't blame them--they're just kids who have parents who've pushed them into the limelight.
Let me make it clear here Â that for me, this movie even though not so good, was better than the original Memento.
It is something I really don't think any other film has quite achieved, though many have tried.
Hooper never came close to achieving anything like this again, and many, though not all, of the film's fascinating resonances are a product of the era and the filmmaker's unconscious sensibilities.
The opener is accurate in one sense, though as much of the film left me feeling the plot - what there was of it - had stopped.
The casting of Dustfinger, Capricorn, Meggie and Farid was pretty much perfect, though.
And all this though, sadly enough, I do love books and movies...
The ending sort of pulls a rabbit out of a hat though.
The movie has a weak, though functional storyline, one that has since became the staple for slasher movies; a group of teenagers get lost, stumble across evil and get stalked and killed.
This is a very well made war movie, though I've got to admit that this is a genre that usually doesn't do that much for me.
Gregory Peck does a fine job in the lead, though I thought he looked a little old to be such a fine career soldier and only a lieutenant.
This doesn't seem to help, though.
Nice location shooting, though.
Moments like this (and Sylvia) make the movie bearable, but it is definitely quite tiresome, even though it's not even 90 minutes long.
In truth, this film doesn't even have to be appreciated as a war film, though that is the setting.
I dislike films that are obvious about the "we are all just brothers under the skin, so won't you just like me even though we're different because I am deferring to you" politically correct party line.
If you see past the wormholes and mutant people (no giant robots here though) there isn't enough plot to disguise the fact the animators are trying to tell us something.
It is most likely a political or social commentary though.
We have the UN becoming a leading world authority by picking up members at a rapid pace, and the Cold War has been over for a few years, leaving the US with a superior economic and military power(Political scientist dub this a "Hegemonic" or "Unilateral" distribution of power, where there is a clear leader, as opposed to the "Bilateral" distribution between the Cold War superpowers, or the "Multilateral" distribution of the many warring countries prior to the modern age) This argument is a weaker one though, since people didn't commonly hate the US until this decade, where we start using that power in the middle east.
Although most people miss it, there was a real reason for this battle, even though it happened right before the ceasefire.
It took me almost a year to get this film back, and the person who borrowed it still had not watched it (though we ended up seeing it together).
Could they have at least TRIED to seem as though they were trying to be credible?
Not really, though I'm sure you'll see it when it hits cable..
The battle action was the best yet seen, though not on the same graphic level that we can expect today.
At the end of the movie I just though they were there to talk cryptically and pretty much do nothing.
People who liked Enemy at the Gates or Black Hawk Down should avoid this one, though.
Those adjustments are costing lives though.
Nice try though.
For what it really is, this is not a bad movie, even though I kept expecting to see Betty White leading a water buffalo down to the river's edge.
It starts on well,have some very spectacular visuals of Africa,but it disintegrates,disorients thereafter.Its very good example how you neglect most vital part(rather say it soul)of movie that is SCRIPT and ends up most boring movie ever made.Storyline simple,leave it nothing to say more about it.I usually watch horror flick for special effect ,but it is not the case here.It seems director avoids such situation where special effect needed,if its there though very few which looks really primitive as compared to other Hollywood movies.I think it could have been better,overall its bad in all aspects except photography.
Even though some of the action sequences are kind of interesting,(with the civil war and all), and the special effects are okay, it just doesn't make up for the film's garish cheesiness (seriously, when the crocodile was chasing Orlando Jones through an open field, was it supposed to be serious?).
The movie isn't all bad though, the crocodile is quite nasty when it pops up, there are one or two nice, brutal kills, some laughs and good CGI for the crock - as well as like I said before, good acting and a good cast.
Oddly, at about the middle of the film, the movie became much less silly in its portrayal of drug use and became a somewhat standard (though very poorly made) cop film.
The film is not one of the better "exploitation" films, but is notable for its cast of authentic Hollywood actors, though they were at this point well past their prime.
Spoilers:   The ending revelation that the title refers to is the fact that Bobby isn't allergic to mangos, even though the tape says that he is.
Even though, according to that same tape, Bobby getting sick is the only thing that'll save his life.
And even though her plan doesn't even make sense, because in all seriousness, there shouldn't be only one fruit vendor in a given city.
I do admit though that the soundtrack was not bad.
I am essentially the key demographic and i disagree that it was completely without it's merits though.
You see men determined to win even though they know they might die (and for what?
"Faces of Death" at least had a documentary feel to it, some attempt at a sequence or progression from one scene to the next, not here though.
The fighting scenes for one was very slow, it seemed like they were both scared of injuring each other when they were fighting, even though they were wearing god knows what inches thick.
Plus there added another subplot of the evil Om Puri and his family especially Suresh Menon which makes the film boring  Too many cooks spoil the broth  Luckily the comic scenes between Akshay, Paresh make you laugh Second half gets nice but too lengthy The entire climax is so lengthy and uninviting, like a 70's climax The choosing of the right guy too is prolonged and boring  Vikram Bhatt does a good job in some comic scenes Music(Anu Malik) is good   Akshay steals the show and owns the film, He is the real star though now he has come a long way as an actor Suneil Shetty overdoes the limp bit but does well in some scenes Paresh Rawal is boring and too loud Shahid Kapur is boring in the lead, while Rimii Sen is pure teakwood with a dubbed voice Johny Lever is loud as usual Vijay Raaz is hilarious, Om Puri hams Suresh Menon irritates Asrani is alright
Not a movie to recommend.Marvellous scenery though, and that was some RV so roomy!
I absolutely hated the use of music throughout the film though.
The real star of this show though was Joshua James who plays the Poe quoting lunatic "Edgar".
Then there is the boyfriend who raises objections over a certain priest as he kind of gets fresh with the main girl and it is obvious and the girl keeps going "Don't attack him" and stuff, though if I were the boyfriend I would have dumped the gal when she told me why she was hesitant about having sex as she had a bit to much baggage.
It's hard to believe Roberta Findlay would make a movie without nudity, but there was not an inch of skin on the Rhino DVD, though there were scenes where I would have expected skin.
She isn't given much to do for most of the movie, though.
What really bugged me, though: I did not think that Mike's original material was all that good.
I was also disappointed that Torch, one of the cooler puppets, was not in the film, even though he appeared in the credit sequence (which was a montage of footage from the previous movies).
You've been warned though.
For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II (1991).
The worst problem though, is the end.
They're pretty much relegated to the odd gory slaughter or two, though.
If you can overlook the above racism, and I I'd like to know who can, Shirley Temple is adorable as usual, dancing wonderfully, though her singing voice, albeit cute, leaves something to be desired, as always.
It's not his fault though, because the movie just doesn't care how he might have felt about it.
My mom is a semi fan of Christopher Walken and this appealed to her I guess though I am usually baffled by what she picks up when I let her choose a movie to watch.
john taylor looks great though, god bless him...
What really got my goat, though, was the worst Yorkshire accents I have ever heard in my life.
the only thing stopping me rating it so low is the cast, even though they didn't do a good job its nice to see them all in one film.
I was rooting for all the "8 Films To Die For" even though I thought they should at least have made them double features or something to give an incentive for going to them all (they were all full price for unproven films/filmmakers...huh?)
The budget of "Dark Ride" was obviously low but not THAT low; they got the universal back-lot and locations at the Santa Monica Pier and the dark ride itself is really pretty cool--even though technically it doesn't look like a "ride" at all--the tracks disappeared early on and never returned, technically the "ride" is a walk through then...isn't it?
Overall though, while it might be worth a watch once either on TV or at a friend's (when they've rented it), it's not one that I would generally recommend.
I though I'd seen the worst of the "8 Films to Die For" already but now that I've proved I haven't I think I'll just stop before I waste any more time on them.
That's unimportant though in the great scheme of things, and I don't mean to say that I don't thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys film or art.
Whomever conceived this abortion lacked the ability to create suspense, though, and instead you are simply bored to tears waiting for some sort of blood, mayhem, and pain.
The company that put together this film, My2Centences (though backed by Lions Gate), must have only put 2 cents into this project.
Even though Bill warned a gal to watch out for the tracks (much later, at that), you could clearly see on the floor there weren't any, and while they went into other rooms there was no logic to the place, no real directional way that the tracks would be able to take a car around in them.
I like that the After Dark horrorfest opted for indie projects in 2006 (even if it was more economical), and some had real merit to them, particularly Unrest, Reincarnated, The Abandoned, and The Hamiltons (Penny Dreadful was fun enough, just padded though with extra victims).
Sadly he is not, and though Minghella is a fine actor, there's not a lot he can do with what is essentially a stick figure.
The soundtrack was a bit weird though, the music was too loud compared to the dialog.
It all looks so silly now though.
The main characters of the great legend look like a bunch of losers and the epic side of the story is obstructed by Merlin's love affair - and, be honest, Sam Neill, though a wonderful actor, is not the right choice for Merlin!
Melinda Dillon was quite good though in a contrasting role.
Better watch "Jaws" again, even though it's for the 200th time.
Deep Blue Sea is great though, but this and Cruel Jaws are vile.
I suppose that it is a little known accent and it only annoys South African's though.
The director in my opinion should have focused more on the shark attacks because in the movie there isn't enough to satisfy the audience, even though the sharks shown in the movie are actually real and cool to watch, the movie lacks any thrill or scary moments when the main cast actually comes face to face with the sharks.
Rose actually berates Cecilia for driving the seriously injured Son to the hospital when there was no other reliable means to safely reach the place as though Cecilia had taken a joyride!
Carole Landis has a minor though pivotal role that really doesn't use her comic talents, but Charles Middleton plays the archtypical villain role that he became known for...especially after he took on the role of Ming the Merciless in Flash Gordon.
And he's not even especially handsome, either (though he does have a sort of boyish cuteness).
Ann has a great hairstyle though in 1970!
It's still fun to pass the time with though.
For a start the title The Fear Chamber has no real relevance to anything featured in the film although that's not a major issue to be honest, what is a major issue though is how bad the script is.
all things considered this movie is pretty unremarkable.it has too many slow spots with nothing happening.then when there is some action,the scenes are way too long and protracted.it's your typical "nut job takes control of an airplane and the good guys try to regain control" movie.i also found it even less realistic than most movies of the genre.the dialogue was pretty lame too.the characters are your run of the mill characters for these types of movies.the acting wasn't great,either,though i did like Ice-T,who plays a federal agent in the movie.the runtime is about 94 minutes with end credits,but it sure felt a lot longer.the bottom line for me,this movie added nothing new to the genre and was certainly not as good as any of the other movies of the genre.if i were you,i would check out "Turbulence" Passenger 57",Executive "Decision" and "Con Air",which are all better examples of the genre.for me,Sonic Impact is a 4/10
The three daredevils then swear vengeance against 39013, and are hired by Granville to hunt him down, even though the impersonation is in effect.
L'Ultimo Squalo had it's own scenes filmed, and (even though some were taken from JAWS), they made their own scenes, their own mediocre shark and their own dialogue.
The best thing about the film though is being able to see all of my favourite shark movies in the one film!
Here though I wish she had chewed some scenery, if she had the film might have become a camp classic.
It's as though he's trying to be a poor man's Clifton Webb.
Strangely there isn`t even moments of mawkish sentiment either , though the producers do try this - And fail - with one scene with Ed in a hospital bed.
However, there was a particular scene I thought was funny though offensive to the core: (SPOILER ALERT) the scene with Black and Blue getting shot at by handicapped gangbangers, with the leader saying retardedly, "B****!
Johnson, though he is basically all mouth in the spirit of Chris Tucker.
It did have a semblance of a plot though.
I want everyone to see this though, for a laugh.
I saw this when I was 11 and even though they say kids will laugh at anything,that's not necessarily true.
In fact, the also deadly serious Billy Jack (1971) made zillions at the box office--not because it was a good film (though it wasn't quite as bad as The Trial of Billy Jack) but because it was a perfect film for the times.
Granted, there have been some contrived though enjoyable episodes - A Death In Chorus and Country Matters are recent favourites - but this one was terrible.
Usually, good acting and production values tend to carry even the more contrived episodes through to a reasonable denouement; for me though, this one was just so silly it was beyond saving.
Dafoe is in on the deal, but is also falling in love with Sandii, even though he knows she is prone to lying about almost everything.
It never really got going and even though the impressive cast do well with a patchy script, you never really believe it because it's clearly bunkum.
Having said that though, it usually gets a look-see whenever it appears on the box (this afternoon for example), just for the quality of the cast and a look at the fifties; and to remind myself of the crush I had on Muriel Pavlow.
I suspect, though, that "not very smart" would need to be added, and I wonder if the correspondence to the comic strip character of the same name is more than coincidental.
Neat ending, though.
Granted, the occasional action scene and gory moment tends to put this above the previously mentioned films, and Reggie Bannister shows up at one point (though his role is essentially an extended cameo) However, the whole thing isn't that different from other Direct to DVD zombie flicks that can be found at movie rentals.
It also doesn't help that the majority of the characters are essentially uninteresting and unlikable (even though the actors for the most part are actually better than expected), and when they die, you don't feel anything other than indifference.
This film looks as though it was funded by money found on the floor and filmed with a camera found in the bin, but that didn't stop me watching it, i needed to know the point to the film, and by the end did i find one, let me think, no.
Take absolutely no notice of positive reviews or quotes made about this film to save yourself 100 minutes; even though you'll most probably give up on this film before the end, if you ever pluck up the courage to watch it as a frightful joke (and even then I'm concerned for your sanity).
There were key details that Branagh changed, though, without good cause.
Even though Rex is insanely obsessed with the disappearance of his girlfriend, why did he have to give himself up to a psychopathic killer and let himself be tortured to death?
We also had ex-cons working in our building, and we had break-ins and crimes committed by maintenance staff, though no rapes or murders.
Maintenance completely lacks originality and substance even though the storyline could very well of worked out with a better cast of characters and better direction.
However as a fan, I felt as though I had to watch it before casting a summary judgment.
This just didn't seem very funny at all and even though it's been a number of years since I've seen it, it still reminds the standard against which I measure how bad a movie is.
The cast features some familiar faces, Malcolm McDowell is in it for about three minutes maximum even though he gets near top-billing in the credits, Chris Penn makes for a sleazy bad guy & is criminally wasted throughout, Costas Mandylor didn't convince me as the most evil man on Earth, Clint Howard makes an appearance as Stalin one of Lord Shin's henchmen, Melvin Van Peebles was here somewhere but I don't know who he played & as for leading man Gary Daniels he is about as wooden & unconvincing as I expected.
There isn't much blood or gore & disappointingly not a single on screen exploding head even though Chris Penn's head almost explodes but unfortunately the scene cuts away just at the vital moment, there is a cool looking zombie though who's in it for a couple of minutes & a few blood spraying wounds.
It's probably for the better though, for if he had screamed, it would have just made the movie worse.
One thing of note though, is that the makers seemed to keep some of the shots from the anime (like when Ken and Shin jump kick each other).
If you happen to be inebriated or just love B-Rated movies in general though there are fares that are far more worthy in this genre and you don't have to be drunk to enjoy them i.e.
This version, though, really shows that sometimes anime needs to stay anime.
A notorious killer's death sentence is carried out by means of electrocution, though things don't go entirely according to plan.
This one's the pits: the title promises nudity and scares (or at least diabolism) - it provides the former in spades, though none of it is erotic, but the latter is only present, if so it can be called, in some silly late-night rituals with nude dancing en masse of old and young witches alike!
Even though I was a kid when I saw the original, I can remember it being much more endearing and convincing than this Sharon Stone remake.
Which she is -- though not for your standard drugs.
Brigitte simply refuses to give in to everything she wants, though she knows it's hopeless.
Still, it's so apparent she's trying so hard that, throughout, you can't help but feel for her, a feat helped by the fact that she is obviously the only cast member who tries to create a character, though as written it's still the "hooker with a heart of gold" type, which is NOT the case with the 1980 film.
Sharp-eyed movie lovers will also notice the ubiquitous Mike Starr as a 'heavy' (he's the one who hangs on to the car Stone is driving); like character actor Dan Hedaya, Starr seemed to inhabit just about every film Hollywood made in the 90's, though here, Starr's part is strictly dramatic and not his usual comedic one.
I happen to like Sharon Stone; I think in some ways she IS underrated as an actress, though one wishes she'd choose pictures that didn't suck.
On the plus side, the score is kinda groovy and the naked babes (it's a French film, after all) make it easier on the eyes, though not enough to recommend.
Even though this is - in my opinion - the best out of the three, I really don't get their appeal.
Finally, we have the hideous way that people treat each other, as though it's all funny.
There are a million movies around like this and I happen to be a fan of predictable romantic comedies(if their good) but I found the characters and humor very weak and even though the movie's not DECADES old or anything it looks dated now, especially the hairstyles.
I was disappointed in Julianne Moore's performance, though she did not have much to work with given the awful script.
Unfortunately no one had the nerve to tell him it was a small role and he gives us his usual "lovable" foreign schmuck stereotype,shouting and waving his arms.His comical misuse of the word "Pussy" should have you rolling in the aisle.It has Tom Arnold in a rather bigger role.He too spends most of his time shouting and waving his arms in between "hilarious" attempts to kiss Hugh Grant.It also has Joan Cusack,a sort of madonna (with a small "m") figure worshipped for her fecundity.She too is very loud,her screams in labour are truly terrifying.And then there is Julianne Moore wafting through the movie half - heartedly,looking as though her mind is really on where she left her car keys.She is so disinterested she can barely be bothered to look at Hugh Grant,which is a sentiment I can at least have a certain sympathy for.
Buildings remain, though surely they would crumble long before 1000 years with no maintenance, and the cities would be overgrown as the grass and trees reclaim the earth.
The cinematography (though no evidence exists to suggest that cameras weren't held by blind apes who pointed towards wherever noise was coming from) is consistently awful.
Barry Pepper and Forest Whittaker (though behind the make-up you can't really tell) are both lucky to have made this film and not subsequently been relegated to making soft-core porn and reality TV.
For some reason though, there are one or two in the movie without any explanation as to how they would come to be.
Be careful with the bomb though, the trigger is on the inside, somewhere around a fuse that says "warning"... (there is no humor in the future) but if you remove it you'll be fine for a few minutes; just enough time to show it to everyone.
In all that time, the Psychlos never found Fort Knox, though gold is high on their shopping list, nor did they stumble on the jet fighters that the humans themselves find when the aliens send them out to find gold.
The humans, by the way, though reduced to primitive servitude by their conquerors, learn to use those jets in about a day, with the help of a flight simulator that fortunately is not only in working order, but can draw on power from... somewhere.
I've heard that BE cost about 70 million dollars to make - though how anyone could have greenlighted it is a great mystery.
loved him in Hard Target......did not see enough of him in this particular movie though......he really is a sexy talented actor...was disappointed...if ya got it strut it.....and he definitely has got it!
Even though i may not be a fan of the movie "Hide and Seek", it actually SHOWED us what happened as opposed to this movie that felt it necessary to give us a 10 minute dialogue because they were too stupid to figure out a way to show it.
only good thing about this movie was Bradley because i connected with him and i feel like him most of the time, though maybe not quite as nice lol.
Seriously though i found some parts of the dialog excruciating.
The acting was overall OK, though sometimes Kinnear makes you raise an eyebrow.
The only reason i stayed though was for Alexa Davalos (bom chicka wah wah).
The main problem is the depressing story though.
They didn't push the boat out with the special effects though, the journey into the past of the 1940's is portrayed by the radio playing old songs and war news, a newspaper will a war headline and a vehicle from the period.
After i couldn't get a ticket for Clerks2 or Silent hill because of the age problem( i am still not 15, not long to go though) so instead i bought a ticket for this film since all the other movies looked quite stupid.
She mopes around about how much she loves him (even though she's been having an affair with one of his clients), but we learn nothing about her except that she has no personality.
Of these problems, though, the writing and directing are the most serious.
And even though he's admittedly spent more time on his abs than on his marriage, after she runs off on a fling with another man, she'll spend the rest of the script trying to get back into his arms.
Overall, there isn't really anything good about the film, though the production values are a lot better than Larry Buchanan's other films--which still isn't saying very much!
American filmgoers who are too lazy to settle in to the ambiance and mood of foreign films will probably not be patient enough for it, though.
The worst, though, was probably the bright red hairdos of Susan Hayward and Agnes Morehead also from THE CONQUERER--even though they were clearly playing Mongolians!!
Apart from that though, not bad.
It's about the death of the West, they say; a fair point, though not a fresh theme in Peckinpah's oeuvre.
Or it's about the problem of a lawman upholding a corrupt law, though as with so many other things about this movie there's more subtext than text to deal with there.
Even "Major Dundee", though rambling in its own right, has a bounce and energy this movie lacks.
Too many tequila sunrises were adding up for this director, and though he still had bullets in his gun, he wasn't placing them as well as before.
They assume that no one has lived there for ages, though logic dictates that someone must reside there, as all of the antique furniture is dust-free.
The concept and the overall presentation though, is entertaining.
Low gore, rushed deaths and ending, tired direction, overly slow build-up, annoying acting (Michael J. Pollard is only slightly less awful than he was in "Sleepaway Camp 3"), slumming thesps (Rod Steiger and Yvonne De Carlo, though at least Steiger has a better wig this time than he did in "The Kindred").
The laughs started to wear thin though and it was embarrassing to watch.
Unfortunately though, there were some crap presentations (a hideous Scarlett Johansson wears too much make-up and informs us that make-up can make us look gruesome...quite ironic...John Travolta and Sandra Bullock, both of whom I like, had to give some stupid speech about rehearsals and being earlyÂha ha?).
It seems as though the director duct-taped a broken mic to the top of his camera and hoped it would capture anything, all I can hear were cars during intimate moments, Because of this, One can barely understand the dialog.
But, for no reason, director Scott feels that even though we had that good opening signaling grand things, we could have done without it for another thirty or forty minutes, which in common sense land is a large portion of a film that doesn't even hit the two hour mark, and that makes zero sense.
(1) I figured out about halfway through the movie who they were going to identify as the werewolf, even though it made absolutely no sense because the person (who shall remain nameless in this review for fear of spoiling the "suspense" for others) did seem otherwise occupied during several of the attacks.
Tony Curtis was OK, not very good though.
Just as often though we see the kinks in his armor.
Unfortunately for everyone, she's had so many X-rays to find out what's wrong that when he comes out, he's dwarfed and deformed, though still quite powerful (as demonstrated by his stripping the skin off a live human male and freezing the entire floor of a hospital, one hapless nurse right along with it!)
Most nutso of all, though, is the brief contribution from Tuttle.
The film itself has better effects and direction than you'd probably expect, though for a sex comedy it's neither sexy nor funny, so fails in both its attempted genres.
Some bits amuse, though there's a tastelessness that borders on the offensive.
It's not all that bad, and William Hunt has his moments as Wang, though strangely for a nudist send-up of 30s serials it's also quite tedious.
oh god..please save the people who has seen this "comical acting, fatuous direction, futile story, insane dialogues,etc" which gave a non-stop unbelievable maligning experience till the end..people watching this will go into an irrecoverable coma..it was an harrowing experience..  the director-what is he trying to make, it looks as though he was completely out of his mind..the viewers will not condone this piece of work..unfortunately this movie has the same director, story-writer, and also the leading actor..at least this time the blame goes to single person..simbhu takes the sole responsibility for making life difficult for viewers..he has given importance in exposing extreme vulgarity..  music-this is the only good thing about this movie..it has some good numbers and good background score..but it doesn't make this rubbish watchable..  nayanthara and reemasen - i pity them both..i feel that they would have done much better for any other movie..they were doing skin show in this entire movie..reemasen's acting was terrible..nayanthara has and always done glamorous roles..she does it so as to hide her acting inabilities..  bottom line-what more to say..if you want to be peaceful please avoid this like dog sh**..if you want to terrorize yourself you are most welcome to watch this A-hole at the highest level..  actually i would like to give it zero on 10..  but the rating is 1/10
Even the background score makes us think that something is going to happen next even though nothing interesting after that.
Not a good reason to give this a thumbs up, though.
$^&%#@&(#@&^@#%^*  Even though stormriders was a bad movie, at least it was entertaining.
It borders on the same humor that made "Virgin" and "Anchorman" hits, but those films --- though I hated them --- at least limited their vulgarity.
Even though its a romantic comedy, the romantic aspects of the movie don't really play the central role in the movie.
Christina Applegate is great in her role but for some reason her role isn't really that big, even though he character plays a big part in the movie its story.
He seems to serve no purpose in the movie, even though I was preparing myself for a big role from him in this movie, after he made his first (and only) appearance.
We're just supposed to assume that they'll live happily ever after, though not much in this movie indicates that they really will.
Myers raises a few smiles as a lazy-eyed air crew trainer,but it is still baffling how this eclectic cast felt there was any mileage from a minor potboiler such as this,especially Oscar winner Paltrow (who has since described the film as 'terrible' in a subsequent UK newspaper interview).Gwynnie is a fine actress,and has ability in light comedy (as proved by her AA triumph in 'Shakespeare IN LOVE'),but she can do little with the feeble,uninspiring part she has taken on here (though she does look lovely in the numerous,if rather tacky outfits she wears),as is the case with other cast members such as Ruffalo and Applegate.There are also some rather pointless cameos from Rob Lowe and George Kennedy (recalling his Joe Patrone character from the AIRPORT series,which are actually rather funnier than this film),and the short running time (around 80 minutes) also indicates that much re-cutting and deletion took place beforehand (it sadly didn't improve the quality).
Candice Bergen tried desperately to reprise her Miss Congeniality role even though her character was written without any personal depth.
But that's the least of the problems with this movie, though.
There's aspects that give a vague nod British production premise of having a couple of losers in the shape of Git Hynes and Bunny Kelly make an unlikely journey but the Irish influence adds a lot of charm to the story that was missing in say THE FULL MONTY  There are a few problems though .
Too bad he was killed, because the writers (even though none are credited... surprise surprise) cannot think up a good story.
That's okay, though, see, because everything else about this movie is just as godawful.
You don't care about any of the characters (though you do want Derrek to make up his mind on staying or leaving), and just wait for the gory parts, of which there are few (though it is decent special effects for such a low-budget film).
It doesn't feel like a whole movie though.
I mean i had a Public Access Show in Atlanta GA in 1999 where people sent me stuff (for you kids, Public Access is how you got stuff played before YouTube), and even though the movies were cheap and low budget and technically 'bad', it was for that type of genre.
1/10 ... though it deserves a -10000 / 10 !
Yes, I would have to say all these movies would be more aptly titled teenagers of the corn rather than children, though I can guess they do it so they do not traumatize a really young kid.
That's pretty much the side story though as the main story follows a news reporter and his son visiting the town with the father trying to get the story of the original film - he also gets an extremely unpleasant to watch love scene with the woman he's renting from.
They were killing to make it grow, though it is fantasy/horror it makes more sense than killer corn leaves that can smash through glass by simply being blown in a gust of wind believe me.
This film does have its good scenes, mainly when Danny is arguing with his dad, the teenage wit and angry demanding parent though stereotypical is realistic and at least gives the movie some sense of reality before it generates into the monomania of your average American teen horrorfest.
One thing stood out though... Stacey, the office birthday girl.
Too "by-the-numbers", not enough gratuitous sex/nudity (though there were plenty of slutty, big-jugged hos in the film...), and there were a few OK gore scenes, but not enough.
Erin Brown actually does a pretty good job (I would have liked to see more of her character), and Tony Todd is decent enough (even though he looks too much like an evil version of Lee "Scratch" Perry-not exactly something that will strike fear into men's hearts), but everybody else seems unrehearsed or bored, spewing forth terrible dialog and bad one liners.
Finally, some of the tributes and references to past European horror movies like "Cannibal Holocaust" and "Burial Ground" are too obvious (though it's nice to see a horror movie that doesn't reference "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "Phantasm" for a change.)
It looks very dated ( even though it is set at the turn of the century ) it looks like it was filmed in the sixties instead of 1982.
If you can find a letterbox transfer of this movie, BUY IT if you enjoy the Handmade Films genre; if you like Time Bandits even though it isn't Jurassic Park.
The good looking teen hero & his girlfriend who becomes the damsel in distress & who both manage to solve the murders even though the combined efforts of the Italian police can't & check out the 'crowd pleasing' comedy scene with the dwarfs in the police station.
Even though in the story, this mansion is supposed to be in India, it is clearly in the UK.
Even though some of the actors do appear to be competent at martial arts, the editing in the fight scenes is so bad that it makes them look like a couple of kids messing around.
However, it's probably the most competent element of the movie, though that's really not saying much.
1/10   By the way this film has inspired me though, if this junk can get distributed then surely i could get a film released too.
Even if there is nothing else on TV, don't waste your time - turn it off and listen to the radio - go for a walk - play a game - read a book - anything is preferable to suffering though this abomination!
This is quite possibly the worst film I've seen since the last worst film I saw, seriously though Swamp Zombies has made it into my prestigious worst ever films list & boy have I seen some stinkers in my time, to gain a place on this list a film has to have certain qualities, a certain type of badness, it has to be a so mind-numbingly bad film as to make me want to me poke my eyes out & Swamp Zombies has those unique, hard to achieve qualities.
Yep, for some characters--some extras, especially the kids, seemed to be smiling with delight rather than wincing in terror, but hey, they are kids (the little girl who played Sofia was quite real, though.
The adult extras and some small roles though, no excuse for them.
The ending was very disappointing though, it kind of ruined the whole movie for me.
The killers motivation is a good twist though.
Janssen is his usual stolid self and Berger is stunning, though really has nothing to do but flirt with Janssen.
But with very bad sound, clumsy credits, actors not interacting, corny music, a confusing plot (though I guessed the bad guy right away), a subplot more about middle-aged lust than romance, literal-minded camera work and a script so full of cliches there was no room for anything original, I had to give it a 3.
It seemed as though whoever wrote the score was just not paying attention to the movie.
The film is set in Egypt, though you really don't see any mummies.
She is worried, though, that the crazed Jannings will follow her and exact revenge.
A poor storyline, a rubbish script, and another low budget film where everything goes well for the good, and the bad get punished or learn a "valuable" lesson (even though really it was the leading female characters fault for closing down the research in the first place).
The animation isn't good, though the opening scene is really well animated.
I, too, saw this film at the Berlinale, and though the matter of rape was treated with maturity and frankness, the film itself was constructed poorly.
Guess they knew they weren't getting a sequel though.
There is the slow witted maintenance man who knows all about the secrets of the old asylum (it bares mentioning that though this is the sort of character that other characters humor he is scene to be doing the work of an electrician, poorly I should mention).
This one feels mostly like Nightmare on Elm Street though, but done incompetently.
all the locals in the bar are vampires.Dusk till dawn 2:Texas blood money though was a whole different kettle of fish.It is a poorly thought out ploy to cash in on a successful movie.Don't get me wrong i'm a huge fan of bad films and commend them if they are in any way inventive or resourcefull,this wasn't.Texas blood money also made use of annoying camera shots it persevered with every point of view shot possible.We had the shot from the pov of a man doing press-ups,we had the shot through the red eyes of a bat and to top it off the pov from a fan moving left to right.Overall it is a highly frustrating film that should never have been made,their certainly shouldn't have been a third installment.Never see this if you haven't,and if you have i feel for you and hope the counciling is going well.
The dialogs looks like they try to be funny (though they aren't).
I have to say it has a nice soundtrack though, especially in the first 45 minutes.
These might have been meant to be funny though at the time I was expecting a serious Woo action film.
My friend rented it thinking it would be hardboiled, it of course wasn't, even though the clerk at the store assured him it was and said he had rented it before.
The other day i watched the war film Sophie Scholl - and even though it didn't have half the 'big' name actors in it and was foreign produced and acted it was the most brilliant film I have seen for awhile and the fact that stupid stupid films such as the last drop (more like the last war film for these film makers) are made, do not do justice to the real stories and real suffering that the occupied countries went through when the Third Reich was in power.
Her estranged boyfriend though, another scientist, is another matter.
The directorial choices vary from very fine (mixing black and white grainy shots from war footage with stagy though competent settings in color) to questionable (allowing a musical score including steel guitar music and contemporary sounds to intrude into a time when such instrumentation was not even known) to mediocre (allowing the actors to be caricatures instead of players in a tense drama).
Bad acting worries no-one, even though this movie is full of it.
Killing off such a fun character in such a light-hearted comedy feels like a total mistake anyway, as though Jessica Rabbit had been bumped off during the final reel of 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
The problem, though, is that while the Powers films were sleazy, they also were funny in an undemanding and crude way.
Harry obviously thought so, though I am inclined to say no...just because there are more than 50 worse films out there--probably several hundred, actually.
For spy films, it might just be the worst from series films--though individual spy films such as THE NASTY RABBIT and LAST OF THE SECRET AGENTS?
This Helm flick should be ranked slightly lower than THE SILENCERS or MURDERER'S ROW, but definitely better than that final train wreck - THE WRECKING CREW (great babes though).
I was also disappointed that Torch, one of the cooler puppets, was not in the film, even though he appeared in the credit sequence (which was a montage of footage from the previous movies).
You've been warned though.
For some reason the puppet Torch is ditched even though he appeared in Puppet Master 5 while Leech Woman makes a reappearance for the first time in the series after having been burnt in Puppet Master II (1991).
The worst problem though, is the end.
They're pretty much relegated to the odd gory slaughter or two, though.
Most disappointing though, is the writers' hubris as they try to change the viewers' sympathies back and forth, to and away form the characters on whims.
This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen (still not as bad as Glitter though).
Worth watching though if only for Lee Remick who is absolutely stunning and quite a skilled dead pan comic.
I try to classify movies as they manage to get what they want, example: John Woo's a better tomorrow is far better than The Matrix, just because, even though a better tomorrow is just about nonstoping action, unfolds in its essence something deeper, and it amuses at 100%, meanwhile The Matrix, tries to get you into a new level of action cinema, tries to do a more reflective exercise in the audience, and that's something impossible to get just by splatting on, between gun shots, the basics of the Platon theories (the myth of the cavern).
I though that Ratman was quite a good film to watch.
Unfortunately, being only two foot four inches tall, Nelson's 'all' is nowhere near enough, and with weak support from genre regulars Janet Agren and David Warbeck, who practically sleepwalk though their roles, Ratman winds up being extremely disappointing.
Even she, though, is two-dimensional.
Then, (it seems, though of course this didn't happen) someone dropped the film and it was hastily reassembled into a vaguely coherent whole.
5 acting is standard though nothing great - akshay has a gr8 character though salman's is the meatier role.
I didn't automatically assume it would be crap even though it was more than likely, but instead went into it hoping for the best.
Even though Michael Bay only produced Horsemen, his trademark screw-ups can be found slapped across every square inch of the film.
Photography is great, though: the film looks slick Â just like an episode of CSI.
The script was also a tragedy and the general story wasn't much better, though it does make one re-evaluate one's standards and perhaps learn something.
I was not impressed by the animated series (neither the 70's nor the 90's versions) though I won't claim to have seen every episode.
But even though Rochelle Swanson is an exceptionally voluptuous woman, not even her wonderful body was enough to keep me interested in the film.
The one surviving song (and rightfully so), "Why Was I Born", is given to Dunne's character, and though she sings sweetly, it's a torch song more suited to later singers like Sarah Vaughn.
The film, though, as a whole, had a very dated appearance.
I will say though that I absolutely hate Chucky as a character.
He doesn't mind, though, because now he can finally fight back against his domineering mother, the school bullies and all the girls that rejected and laughed at him.
It's tamer than it sounds though and some of the dialogue is laughable.
Sadly, in some ways this sounds a bit like Ms. Minelli's real life, though I do wish her the best in her recovery.
I though Pumpkinhead was poorly shot & didn't work.
But its main-story remains really the main reason though that the movie never truly works out the way it's supposed to.
Not random victims, though.
And though not included in highschool history texts, there was considerable sympathy for the North from the peasantry of the South because of the landlord-dominated government of the South, many of which had collaborated with hated Japanese occupiers during WWII.
And even though the seams from stock footage are pretty obvious, the film is well produced with locations at Fort Carson, Colorado, where the terrain was said to resemble that of Korea.
During the Mexican carivan scene first the guy drops his gun then a black man in a animal wrangle outfit walks into the shot, real bad editing... kinda funny though...
The two German actors and the beautiful though dull Marisa Berenson.
one credit though, the acting was great.
I didn't even care all that much when the guy dies in the beginning, even though they tell us we should.
Diana first uses the machine on Cesar, who, though innocent,has been convicted for the killing of the female border guard.
Production quality was good though ie.
Finding these blurred and hidden themes though isn't worth the effort.
And though they don't further the plot along in the strictest sense, they do parallel.
The traces of it are so strong, it must have just left the room, and it's almost as though if we hurried we could catch it.
At that moment I was at a loss for words, though I had watched the show night after night, and I fully understood it, I couldn't truly say I enjoyed it.
Every time I watch it, it bewilders me so I can't turn my eyes away from the screen, even though I remember all what happens by heart.
Michael York is excellent as well, though he is often underestimated.
By 1920 though Silent Pictures had been established as a major threat.
On first viewing I found myself fast forwarding through the film, looking for "the good parts", though really I didn't give it a chance .... Then with time to spare, I gave it another go.
Also, the preview was totally misleading and made it seem as though the movie was actually going to be interesting and not a snail-paced confusion.
Cabaret deals a lot with the Nazis coming into power in Germany in the early 1930's,even though it looks like a secondary theme in the movie.The closing shot is off a room full of Nazis shown through a mirror.It leaves no questions about the future of Germany.I haven't seen that many films dealing with pre nazi Germany before and I thought this one did it quite well.
In his other movies though, musical performances tend to steal the show almost entirely.
As predicted in her song, she proves basically unable to engage in any serious relationship, despite her involvement with Michael York ( "And though I used to care, I need the open air, you'd every cause to doubt me Mein Herr").
The new writing/directing team of Megan Martin and Brett Sullivan pick up where the previous film left off, skillfully bridging the two with a bare minimum of rehashed exposition, and the end result is extremely satisfying (though the machinations of "Unleashed"'s final third made me wish the script had tied some thematic/character arcs together better).
So these guys are GOING to a sports game (i forget which, though likely the Bulls or the White Sox since they're near the oh-so-scary ghetto), yet they can't even make it down the freeway without having an onboard viewing command center that would put ESPN to shame.
Seems as though an ancestor of his was none other than Claude Rains who as John Griffin invented that invisibility formula that had the entire United Kingdom on edge.
It was as though the scriptwriter skimmed through the book and made the rest up.
There were a couple of decent jokes in the mess though, but I didn't actually laugh at any of them.
It never shows that spark between Openly Gator and Queer Duck, even though we know they had been in a committed relationship for some time.
The charm of the web cartoons is present, though being much longer in running time, the hit and miss ratio is more uneven.
I dunno...at the end it kinda reveals why, though) starring horribly contrived characters and too many twists for your head to remember.
I enjoyed seeing the Misfits play at the end, even though the camera was flying about all the time so you couldn't quite get a grasp on them being there.
Overall though, the movie is trying to show you that there was a comic book put out called Campfire Stories and here is the movie based on these stories.
And then a deputy who is southern (even though nobody else in the scene is) agrees to investigate the stalker for No Name.
He killed his own neighbor, though he thought the stalker had killed him because he had seen the two of them together.
This one you can skip, though.
As the movie progresses, though, you realize that all the interesting action scenes were already contained in the preview.
The acting is decent enough though the love scenes were sort of gross.
This is pretty much a tiring film after awhile, and though it shouldn't have been more than 70 or 80 minutes, the damn thing stretches on for nearly 100.
And even though neither of them is capable of producing full sentences, we're supposed to believe that they're intelligent enough to trick health inspections and a pair of private investigators?
Not enough though.
Well, the film was pretty much what I expected, though the quality of the production was not quite as horrible as films by other contemporary "artists" like Al Adamson, Larry Buchanan, William Grefe and Ray Dennis Steckler--but it was very, very close.
Oddly, though the corpses weigh between 100-200 pounds, the container catching the puree is only about big enough to hold a Pomeranian, but this is a minor detail.
Lars von Trier's original Kingdom works on so many levels - entertaining, scary, thoughtful, full of lifelike though odd characters and the genius of the "dogme" style of filming created by von Trier.
I was amazed it lasted 5 years, though here in the DC area we only saw it for three, as it got dropped due to low ratings, I guess.
I doubt we'll see this show pop up again in furhter syndication here in the states, though it will probably make it's way over to Europe where it will be a bit hit, due to the strange taste's over there.
Even though the author of the novel (Ronald Giphart) has a cameo in this movie where he states that the movie is in fact a lot better than the book - this film is absolute crap.
In the movie, though, he looks to be about 10 or 11, but seems to still act 6 or 7.
There was one very uplifting part to our experience, though: After leaving the theater, my husband found a five dollar bill on the ground.
I would have liked to seen the color version though, just for the fun of early Techocolor.
There aren't much of them though.
He is somewhat appealing in a geeky way and even though he flips out and turns into a stalker, you feel a bit sorry for him.
We see the same window over and over even though the people comment about the "maze" they get lost in.
I'm glad to see that IMDb users were not fooled by Almereyda's ultimately empty, though pretty, adaptation of Hamlet.
That `vision,' however, turns out to be somewhat clouded, and though the basic story remains intact, it comes across as something of a `Cliff's notes' rendition that is less than satisfying.
Add to that the fact that Almereyda's adaptation of the play is terribly wanting; the character development is lacking, and though the language of the play remains, Almereyda's judgment of what to keep and what to lose in making the necessary cuts to bring a four hour production down to just under two, are questionable.
A tremendously talented actor, Schreiber has not yet achieved the acclaim he so richly deserves, languishing too often in forgettable films like `Kate and Leopold' and `A Walk On the Moon,' though he was perfectly cast as Orson Welles in the made-for-TV film, `RKO 281,' in which he was brilliant.
And Julia Stiles, as the doomed Ophelia, seems to be grasping at straws in a vein attempt at finding her character, and of the three mentioned here, her performance seems the most strained and unnatural, though it is so with both Hawke and Shepard, as well.
As Polonius, Bill Murray acts as though he is reading his lines from cue cards.
More often, though, the sequences are predictable and fairly laughless.
And there are some funny moments, not intentionally funny though, 'Its in the back of the net already tomazzo!
Try the PBS documentary if you're looking for a less biased background of the conflict (though that still has some significant omissions).
This documentary acts as though Israel was making a major concession at Oslo to negotiate any Palestinian state at all, giving up "its land" (meaning the West Bank and Gaza), but there is no mention that the Palestinians were officially giving up claim to 78% of the country.
Though keep in mind, this is coming from someone who expects a lot out of movies that are acclaimed... (an 8/10 on IMDb is decent, though Butterfly Effect has ~100k votes as opposed to around 4-5k votes on this movie) Sure, the movie has great eye candy and is nicely animated.
As a result, the films, though popular in their day, were just awful by today's standards.
However, it is still historical of course to see Chaplin in his first film, even though he is not honed.
It's as though they had two ideas, and instead of deciding on one, they just included both.
The woman who played Velma was also well-cast, though she didn't quite command the same presence Lillard has.
The special FX ranged from excellent to abysmally computerized, though Scooby was better animated than I initially expected.
The farting/belching/peeing scenes were what both audiences laughed most at, though for the life of me, I can't understand why.
It also seems odd with their appearance in the film that Sugar Ray didn't write an original song, instead recycling a song off of a 9 month old album (though the song was probably new when they began filming, but still...).
Don't worry though there's plenty more tiresome characters where he came from.
In the end, Stanley is so naive that he is bought off by having the kid named after him, as though a businessman who has achieved enough success for early retirement is stupid enough to accept this as ample compensation for months of degradation, belittling, rejection, financial draining, and every other kind of mistreatment they could think of.
I'll admit up front that I have serious reservations about some of Minelli's films, beautifully shot though they are.
Bennett terrifying Tracy with a desperate drive across the city to the hospital (for the birth of their grandchild) comes closest to actually being funny, but there's no capper, no punchline, and Bennett's calmness doesn't seem comically incongruent, but merely inappropriate, as though she doesn't know what sequence they're filming.
this was horrible though.
Most victims, though, are pulled away by the thing.
Presented as a history channel style documentary, detailing an alternative history of the United States, or in this case the Confederate States, as though the south had won the American Civil War.
It's as if they just had to add that bit of complete stupidity, as though driven by some irresistible instinct, unable to help themselves.
But the interactions were "conversational," even though from the screen display the three principals were often actually separated by thousands of miles.
There is a plot here somewhere, though, and to start off with it follows four vampire sisters.
Even though the acting's not great, the dialogue is terrible and the editing is horrible, this segment is visually very beautiful.
The art direction is also good, and though the storyline is a bit muddled it's still not too difficult to follow.
I'll certainly still check out more films from Rollin based on the positives here even though I was less than enthusiastic about this effort.
What fascinated me though: It's all made up.
Really, if they wanted to show that widows can remarry then they should have made it like this : Even though Sallu dies, Rani gets over him in 5-6 yrs.
I can still feel this film in my blood, though it must be 20 years since I last saw it.
I guess there is the mildest interest in what happens at the end of the film, though your expecting everything to work out alright.
No worries though cause when the refs try to call the police on the limo's phone they find out that the mobster owns the phone company too.
Not that we see much of these lives, though.
Or even yet, look for the original graphic novels (not the awful Archie comics version though).
Behind the surfaces, though, it's reactionary trash which preys on hatred and misunderstanding of sexual minorities.
As of this moment, though, he's just a kid with a camera, and it shows.
Some good special effects, though really unexplained.
Avoid as though it were deadly poison.
Jeanette had a co-star though who was more suitable to her voice.
As of this moment, though, he's just a kid with a camera, and it shows.
Everyone else seems to be posing up a storm, like they cast a  bunch of models, led by Gorgeous George Clooney, still tilting his head  and smirking as though that made a character come to life.
Generally speaking though there's a great cast here including Malkovich, George Cole, Kathy Staff, Michael Gombon & Glenn Close as the owner of a London whore house.
I think it is fair to say that I was disappointed with this film and that I didn't think it was very good, though it was far from the worst film I've ever seen.
Acting is terrible, but I'm not sure if it's due the actors themselves or the abysmal writing so I'm really not certain if I should feel sorry for them or be disgusted by them, though I have to say some of them look truly embarrassed to be there.
I hope you're not the type of person who enjoys action movies with a climactic final battle, though if you're the kind of person who enjoys movies with a hilarious slap fight you're in for a treat.
The script seemed to have been written on a chalkboard - interchanging cliche after cliche though lacking a satirical or retroactive temperament.
Gooding visits him in prison to try to find out what happened even though it's none of his business.
And still strong though not as water-cooler talk as it used to be.
The most unlucky cast member though is Ms Judd who hasn't made any more movies since this one .
I do look forward to the DVD movies though.
I also enjoyed "true lies" better than "La totale" though.
As it is though, all the good intentions fall flat on their faces.
She deserved a million dollars, even though she didn't win.
The action is neat even though the FX are slightly weak my modern standards.
The three main characters are well rounded, interesting, and you care about them so much that the human characters seem somewhat less relevant (though not entirely because they serve as motivation for the characters to when they will return home).
Even though the movie basically features all of the ingredients needed for me to enjoy a silly B-horror movie, "C.H.U.D."
John Heard and Daniel Stern are both respected actors, though they are mostly active within the comedy genre.
It's just an 15 seconds part though but it was fun to see how his career started of for him.
Amazingly enough the movie in 1989 even got a sequel, though I doubt that this was because of the big box-office successes of this movie.
Typical monster movie for this time though as someone is trying to figure out what is beneath the city and seemingly eating the citizens on the surface.
I only gave it a "4" though, maybe because the middle of the movie dragged, and I was expecting better special effects than the movie could deliver.
He takes a photo of a gored leg that shows something sinister is going on, though all I saw was bad make-up.
CHUD is based on a pretty interesting premise though.
Quicksilver Highway tells two lame and tedious stories, even though the respected authors Stephen King and Clive Barker wrote them.
The special-fx though are pretty good for a no-budget film like this.
Acting is OK though, thankfully the movie has some good actors but it doesn't come close to compensating for this hopeless flick.
Even though there were plenty of big name actors in this pic, it seems they left their talent in their trailers.
The science isn't realistic though that's a given.
If, however, it's an insidious and subtle parody of recent disaster films it might be a triumph... i doubt it, though.
Hang on though; how do you steer a vessel with no control surfaces anyway- A WIZARD DID IT.
And I'm happy to say it worked out again in this monstrous sequel and I was actually digging this one a tad more, though that was up until the stalling sequences involving hiding out in a house.
I guess it's a good thing though that the DNA of such a twit is wiped from our society in these industrial accidents.
(Hmm...) Moreau's attempt to reverse his experiment by turning Braddock from man to animal is promising; it's too little, too late though and the idea is never fully explored.
Good score though.
Even though his role consists of two lines.)
All us fans of that Edwoodsian mega-flop are praying (even though I'm an atheist!)
However, my optimism was challenged, because by the time the last 30 minutes of the film came to fruition, it looked as though the cast were just keen to see the end of it and so was I.
It really had me wondering one thing though.... What decent scripts did Hollywood pass over for this melange to escape the net?
Even though it has shocking and sometimes stomach turning scenes, it can still be funny and make you laugh.
Written and directed by Rene Daalder I really didn't like this much at all, even though I know it gets a lot of good reviews.
That's the teen-aged Joan Leslie we're talking about, and, man, she looks good, though rendered sullen by her disability.
And Virginia Mayo is supposed to be part Pueblo Indian, though she looks about as Indian as Jean Harlow, the heavy makeup notwithstanding.
Stoler, in her nurse's uniform, looks like a camp icon (and in a house-dress with her hair down, she seems a refugee from a John Waters satire); her performance is almost all on one-note and she's tiresome, though Lo Bianco is exceptional and well-cast as a horny, naughty boy in a man's body.
It`s as though the screenwriter got bored with the subplot and discarded it while he was writing it and the film is littered with these subplots that are unexplained and go nowhere .
Even though Huston was getting old at this point, he was still tackling challenging material in his old age, which possibly explains the odd mix of provocative, dense material with stilted, unintuitive storytelling.
I saw this film right on the day it opened in a large theater and even though I wasn't familiar with the original German TV Series I at least expected decent action entertainment and hoped to experience some two hours of fun and adrenaline.
This is even more lamentable, as the film presents its assets in a very loose and disadvantageous manner: even though it contains some extremely strong elaborate stunts, explosions (of choppers, cars and even entire planes) and shootouts, which certainly would be worthy of a true Hollywood action production, these supposed assets are not presented as eye candy at all.
Where it takes us is though a series of coincidences and mistakes, all of which the plot is built upon, and throws consideration into the wind.
As this movie is the worst movie ever, though the storyline is very very common two friends in love, but their ego comes between, than then they find someone i n their life to avoid their friendship, but as I told you naa a very common story, in end they again meet, so please guys its a humble request don't go for this flick its a complete waste of time and money.
If you guys remember than 5 years ago there's a movie named Tujhe Meri Kasam, tjis movie is complete copy of that film, though in that movie songs are awesome, good comedy and excellent performance by all character's.
And to be fair, West is remarkably well preserved for eighty five (though it is a long, long stretch to pretend that she's the platinum blonde goddess she's meant to be.)
Cameos from others such as Rona Barrett and George Raft (Mae's first screen co-star in 1932, who grimaces through his scene with Mae in the elevator as though he regretted agreeing to do it) abound.
The story though is the least reason to watch.
It stinks I can't give this less then 1-star but since I can't this will have to do even though it deserves a -10.
A word of caution though...should you wake up in the middle of it you will probably scream in abject horror...you will think you are having a Christmas nightmare...or hope that it really is all just a bad dream!'
I was sad to see though that when I went to see this my childhood images and memories were reduced to a glitzed out pop film with no substance.
I couldn't believe the original Neil, Laura, and Charlie were brought back though I felt they were used as filler characters more than anything.
I'm glad I stayed for the Buddy Claus scene though - the generic baby with a red scarf on his head was the star of this scene.
As I grew up, though, it was a lot of fun to understand some of the jokes that I had missed as a kid, which is what's so appealing about that movie.
The other Legendary Characters, though fun to see, seemed they could have been utilized better.
My favorite secondary character though is Judge Reinhold's ever optimistic, quirky psychologist.
Tim Allen, whom I've always found amusing, seemed as though he rushed through the film.
If you can look deeper though you'll see a film that's about teen angst, yearning and the tortures of growing up in an age where nothing matters.
As far as gags go, this is a far cry from "Mush and Milk" when the kids would rig a vacuum cleaner for the cow (though a lot less abusive, I will admit).
(though at least the mistress gets naked twice).
I didn't automatically assume it would be crap even though it was more than likely, but instead went into it hoping for the best.
Even though Michael Bay only produced Horsemen, his trademark screw-ups can be found slapped across every square inch of the film.
Photography is great, though: the film looks slick Â just like an episode of CSI.
This show made me feel as though I wanted to vomit.
To give them the benefit of the doubt, though, perhaps they were hoping to shed some light on abusive relationships.
They could have done a better job of it, though.
The acting was excellent, and the plot, though difficult to see at points, was quite good.
There is a large and underserved market for wholesome kids' films, though.
My 8 year old liked it, though.
This film did practically nothing for me though, and I can't recommend it to anybody.
The final nail in the coffin though had to be the resolution.
It goes in a completely opposite direction of where you though it was going and it makes sense.
What's worse though, is the stupid sheep-like gullibility of some of the viewing public who interpret such "novelty" as daring and mold-breaking.
Her surrounding talent is questionable though.
Props for great cinematography here and there though.
There is, though, an unusual twist at the end.
For example, just when the rich guy is about to kill the wolf, his wife inexplicably stops him from shooting it--even though this wolf is tearing apart their doggy.
Even though he may take us down familiar roads and into slightly unconventional territory, "Nowhere" remains a stubbornly unique vision of youth and pop-culture.
Ultimately in the end not worth the effort or your precious time.What still amazes me though, is how in hell did IMDb give this movie a 7 out of 10??
Even with all that hidden talent though, the movie turns out to be exactly how the DVD case made it seem... embarrassing.
Michael Cera's sketch though actually had me laughing for a few hours after I had already watched the movie.
From the offset this film tries so hard to pull off a 1999 teen comedy spoof, though it fails cringefully.
There was a main plot of the film nestled inbetween the separate dire toilet humour gags, though it was underdeveloped and poor.
Therefore we have Kareena, Payal Rohatgai, Tanushree Dutta, Ishaa Koppikar, Sambhavana Sheth all displaying either their legs or their cleavage, the male counterpart is taken care of solely by the model-turned-actor Upen Patel (a confident debut though need to work hard on his dialog accent).
The question though, is who needs it?
Coppoloa is as obsessive about getting down every little uninteresting detail about people and events he doesn't understand the significance of, as his protagonist is; if the process of watching the minutae of bugging is SOMETIMES involving (as in the opening scene, where we see how the title conversation was recorded in the first place; or the sequence in which Caul patiently and methodically sifts through what sound like random crackles in order to pull out complete, comprehensible sentences; or even the trade show, where matters of moment look as though they might be under discussion), this is because it's sometimes going somewhere.
Another huge problem with Grizzly Rage is that the suppose threat just comes across as really tame, the Bear never really does anything other than stand on it's hind legs & there's this obviously dubbed roaring noise even though you can clearly see the Bear is just not angry or aggressive.
Manitoba has a thriving movie industry - though you would never know it from watching this 90 minute waste of time.
Please excuse us for putting out this trash (Kate Todd is pretty cute though!).
She can't off these idiots fast enough, even though the footage of the bear is obviously some unused documentary footage from Animal Planet.
probably half-assed the script thinking it was so great even though the movie was way too overrated, it's just such a terrible movie.
The mother is still watching over her boys, by the way, though she can only seen from behind or heard in the distance.
The cartoon cat then sets out with the other animals into the big city (which is populated by cartoon animals even though the farm has a human family) to find Chanticleer, who has turned into an Elvis parody and is being seduced by a sexy chicken.
Over and over, this show has repeatedly tried very hard to promote interracial relationships even though they are statistically rare (about 3%) yet oddly enough - they never address the racial component of a relationship.
It's good for a laugh though.
It's a shame Warner Bros won't release it on DVD though, as like many other Pryor classics (see Stir Crazy, Brewsters millions, and See no evil, hear no evil) this is fantastic.
The last flashback too is prolonged and also the entire clash between Govinda-Karisma and Tabu  N Chandra disappoints Music is okay, Bahot Khoobsurat stands out  Govinda tries a negative role and does very well in it though he overdoes it too much at times Karisma is good but irritates at times with her cries Tabu is okay Nirmal Pandey still doesn't know the difference between loud screaming and acting rest are okay
Her movies are frequently not my favorite, though I did enjoy the cute Baby Boom.
It is indeed sad that so many people seem to praise this mindless, uninspiring, unoriginal, and not even particularly amusing pearl of wisdom as though it had virtually descended from the gods on Mount Olympus.
This movie was funny and amusing though.
The folks at the studio tried, in their own way, to create a film about women's liberation and equality--though by today's standards it seems incredibly sexist and silly.
Still though, for all its faults (there's plenty), it's still kind of fascinating at times, in a "why am I watching this?"
The removals guys were just really predictable (with the King Kong Bundy joke not really working nowadays) and though he usually makes me laugh the Dana Carvey section just wasn't well.......funny.
Its poor quality sneaks up on you, since there's minimal dialogue before the first extended action sequence (though said dialogue does include the news that this Iraq company will be heading home inside of a week, which anyone who has ever seen a cop movie knows is a sure sign of impending death and destruction).
For a long time I only owned Lethal Weapons 1,2 and 4 and only bought this because it was dirt cheap and people always moaned at me for missing it out, even though they understand that it is a rubbish film.
It plays out like an old episode of the TV show 'Thriller' with some nudity added (though Pappas obviously has a body double) and some hippy/flower-power shtick thrown in replete with cheesy music which is probably the best thing in this predictable yawn of a movie.
There's some good performances, especially by the female cast members, though little else to offer the average film-goer looking for escapist entertainment.
I will say though, that the panther may be heard, but is never seen.
On the plus side though, I do owe the (completely unscary) chap that plays the murderer a favour.
is pathetic nonsense throughout, a script obviously non-existent, acting is ridiculous, f/x are more than poor (even for low-budget standards) - all in all this is a complete waste of time (not a waste of talent though, as there simply is none at all...), nothing more or less than disgusting dreck!
Some of the special effects are pretty good though, which is why I gave this movie 3 instead of 1 (or maybe 2).
May or May Not Contain Spoiler.. don't think so though!!
One may miss the jangling ambient noise of Platform and Unknown Pleasures, though, and particularly the informative TV broadcasts of the latter, which always fit in context even though they may speak to us more than to the characters.
Pitt I was surprised and impressed with, though I was doubtful at first of his being cast.
A special mention though, at least they didn't succumb to digital effects for the snakes.
For some reason Silent Predators was shot in Australia even though it was an American produced & financed film supposedly set in America?
Great scenery, though.
Even though it's a small low budget production, I can't help but feel that Justin Lo wrote himself into the lead role just so he could make out with whoever was going to fill the role as the attractive drifter.
Neither Antonio Banderas nor Selma Blair have enough to do to make much of an impression, though Banderas manages at least to be somewhat charming through the muddle of the storyline.
The plot about the Mum (Meg Ryan) whose son is in the FBI (Colin Hanks - who here acts as though he has a large plank inserted right up him especially in his scenes with Selma Blair) - starts with Meg Ryan losing 200lbs of fugliness suddenly becomes beautiful wealthy vivacious and sexy, much to the son's embarrassment, is just tooo much.
On paper it looks as though this strenuously boring film should be worth watching: Shawn's previous credentials, the direction by Tom Cairns, and the presence of Julianne Moore and Matthew Broderick together with little feature appearances by the likes of Campbell Scott and Blossom Dearie should suggest investing time in viewing.
Unfortunately the film's premise is so dull that even the technique of having characters speak exactly what is in their minds mixed with dialogue seemingly more appropriate for human ears and adding dreamlike sequences including some rather randy voyeurism - stage worthy though these techniques may be - just can't make this dreary story of a day in the dissolution of a VERY bad marriage work.
Some romances develop, a foreign Russian worker Anna is introduced to the group even though she and another Chinese girl Tao don't share the same language.
Somehow though with all the issues involved, rural people coming into the cities, technological communication, the erosion of China's agrarian past, the fakeness of place, the exploitation of workers and lead up to prostitution, the camaraderie of friends, the cheapness of life.. somehow all of these themes are jumbled into a glorious presentation that you can't take your eyes off of.
Bet it's not what they intended though... (generous 3 out of 10)
At first, they look to us as swaggering city sophisticates, as they dress-up in international costumes for a park revue, surrounded by emblems of international commercial culture, like fake Louis Vuitton bags and movie posters, such as of "Titanic," They jealously and zealously call each other constantly by the most modern cell phone and text messengers, particularly from the encircling monorail that at first seems like a symbol of modern technology, but is really cobbled together from airplane parts--though one woman wistfully notes that she doesn't know anyone who has been on a plane- a frequent response to a call is "I'm on the train."
Morgan would have been better as Kurtz' commanding officer, the three-star General -- though I totally understand why he'd turn the role down (fewer lines).
The obligatory scenes of intimacy are poorly framed, as though the director either has no visual sense, lacks interest or feels apologetic about including them at all.
Altogether this low-budget movie ranks as just another predictable, uninspired, though slightly more complicated pirate saga, bolstered somewhat by Hayward's agreeable performance.
"My Friend Flicka" is by far the best of the three, and "Thunderhead, Son of Flicka" (as it was renamed) was not bad, though each contains minor changes from the books.
Kari is the best-developed character in the film, even though she gets less screen time than Philip or Erik.
But, though it has several plots going on at once, to a degree it's more short subject than full-length movie.
About the director, he must realize that a movie can be comic even though it has intelligent people in it, everything doesn't have to be so dumb.
The frustrated viewer may be forgiven for concluding either that neither producer nor screenwriter had read anything relevant beyond a short encyclopaedia article or two (though, doubtless, both looked at many an illustration of the time: costumes and sets are largely accurate) or that both deliberately chose to reinforce the stereotypes to which the ignorant subscribe (Parliamentarians were dull, bigotted fools; Royalists were noble and brave; etc., etc., etc.).
I do like the "Garbage Day" bit though.
Blackport gives a decent acting performance, though not of the caliber of other great "thriller" actresses such as Jodie Foster and Laura Linney, and yet the movie was quite compelling and intense.
In this one though, it Eddie Murphy wears a bit thin, and the plot reads like a McBain (of Simpsons fame) film, with its horrific cliches and awful script.
Even though the movie deals with more serious issues, it's still very funny and you laugh a lot.
If you played and enjoyed FF7 than it is a worthwhile watch, though nothing too special.
The English dub seemed fine to me, though I didn't watch it in Japanese, so I shan't judge the Japanese dub, but only the English one.
When he switched from one to the other, you felt it as though he'd taken a sledgehammer to your head.
They had personality, though, I'll give them that.
Even though I'm not a big fan of anime, I do have to say I was impressed with the wild fight scenes.
Barbara Turner tags along looking appropriately concerned, though she isn't much help.
Rather empty science-fiction/horror/adventure story bridged somewhat by Davis' narration and Turner's fixedly grim expression, though well-directed by Kenneth Crane for California Studios.
Anyway, all this just to illustrate that the mission is half dead by the time they reach the monster and YOU just sat and watched an hour of wilderness documentary footage even though you counted on seeing a Sci-Fi monster movie.
The cast is politically correct enough, though.
One thing though that is timely.
- The U.S. government is relying on the scientific advice of two scientists, even though the end of the world is about to happen.
The story had potential though.
The effect is most prevalent though with songs and choreography, which highlights the composer, A. R. Rahman's quite apparent contribution to the success of this film.
Whats funny though is the fact that 5 seconds later we see him sitting on a rock by himself playing a challenging game of pocket pool, but before he can finish flogging the dolphin he gets scared and runs away.
Even though this is sick it just shows that if this was the best part of the movie imagine what the rest of the movie is like.
without knowing much by the DVD cover i didn't know what to expect even though it said "in the vein of dawn of the dead, Shaun of the dead as well as other zombie movies."
Iris slowly gains confidence through such comradery and at one point she doesn't want to leave, even though her father has higher career expectations for his daughter.
Phony hysterics in a child psychopath is the wrong choice (though it may have worked well on stage).
Average romance comedy that had bad screenplay and script.Hepburn and Tracy gave great performances though and carried the whole movie on their shoulders.The directing was almost below average as well.The best part of the movie was only the last 10 minutes.Very slow start which will really test how much you love Golf or these lead stars.Only for big fans of the famous Spencer Tracy/Katherine Hepburn love team.......
To Ali's credit though, his use of flashbacks was very well-done.
compared to the TV series,this thing is crap.i couldn't get through it,i was so bored.it's just not exciting.there's no real suspense or excitement,at least up to the point i watched.that's really surprising,given the quality of the series.it takes place after season six,and before season seven,so i guess it's a season seven prequel.if you can get through it,i would recommend it,as it does fill in some gaps between the sixth and seventh season.i only know this,because in some scenes they allude to events that must have happened in the movie.for me,though it was just too difficult to get through.my vote for 24:Redemption is a 4/10
Herbert Lom is solid in a small cameo and Peter Cushing's first-rate performance added class, though he doesn't appear until halfway through the film, but his lone performance couldn't elevate the film from being below average.
It's not an erotic film though, if that's what you're expecting - psychological depth is conspicuous by its absence.
Vivek Oberoi is a talented actor and acts very well, though he is not as good as his female costar.
Even though, to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including Gays in one shows, sucking American reality show.
He isn't the lover boy type though I have to give him credit for trying.
The songs were pretty good though I found them to be a little (not too much) overrated.
This is the tenth film featuring Spanish horror star Paul Naschy that Iâve watched; though best-known for his series of âWaldemar Daninskyâ werewolf movies, he made all kinds of genre efforts â even scripting many of them himself under real name Jacinto Molina.
Naschy, by the way, plays three roles here (though one of them, a horned demon, is only featured in a sequence depicting the heroineâs nightmare) â another finds the star at his most Brando-like (albeit inspired by the Method actorâs variable stint in the psychedelic star-studded concoction CANDY [1968]!)
I'm sure this film, though, will have a fervent following if it were to get a DVD release.
Perhaps there's a reason why it hasn't, though.
I think the film's biggest misstep is not featuring Price as the central character, even though Kenny Everett has some shining moments.
If Hitler had won, my own family (the Dutch side) would have been 'resettled' in Poland as farmers, to clear out the subhuman Poles (even though going back 250 years, their common ancestor was a shepard from Silezia).
The point being that racism makes no sense, even though it is very much incorporated into the fabric of this series.
Sadly, the adaptation to screen just does not gel in any real compelling way, though the detail oriented plot should throw enough curve balls to keep mystery buffs afloat.
The whole storyline and concept is magical, mystical and mysterious though it succeeded in being unconvincing.
Nice idea though, just got in the wrong hands for carrying it out, I think.
Make no mistake though, it is a poor film.
This travesty though...I think it's time to stop.
and like mentioned before, a suitable film to North Indian audiences and it is a film that is worth watching (though not as good as `Alai Payuthey').
To be honest though there's absolutely no reason for Pinhead and Co. to be in the movie since the villain is Lance Henriksen a father who is embittered about the death of his son   There's all the symbols , iconography , plotting and situations common in all teen slasher films .
The guy playing Adam's father was the only decent actor though.
Funny, seems as though our heroine has a pretty good imagination...
The 2 actual cenobites include that annoying chatterer wannabe(in the ending of the movie he has a neat toy though),and the guy whos has a black cloth on his eyes and mouth(any help on which movie this guy is from?).
Decent ending, though!
It could have used more deaths though.
I could tell though, before any of drivel that passed as "horror" in a franchise that isn't even supposed to be horror, that this movie would suck based on the Pinhead shirt one of the characters was wearing.
What disappoints me so much though is not the crappy acting, the swiss-cheese plot, or the sheer failure to achieve even mediocrity.
Regardless, DEADER showed us that a decent, intelligent (though at times incomprehensible) Hellraiser story can even be woven from a non-Hellraiser work.
The problem, though, is that even if you do know who everyone is and what the references were about, it just wasn't particularly funny.
The bad guys all wear black so you know they're the bad guys; the baddest of the baddies (and the leader) always wears black suits, even though all the action is at a beach or on the water.
It's not a question of not liking the people depicted, though none are likable, especially not the irritating doctor character.
Originally billed as rollicking family entertainment (though rated 'M' for mature), things take an odd, disquieting turn with an extended trip to a cathouse, where the kid's guardian (Steve McQueen) tussles with his favorite prostitute, who wants to go legit and get married (there's also a bloody fight between two youngsters that seems to come out of nowhere).
She was said to be the daughter of a Brahman priest; or something similar -- all make-believe promotional bullshit, made possible by her dark eyes, hair and complexion (though she wouldn't have fooled nearly as many in Jakarta or Bombay as in Paris, of course).
Downright prostitution did occur, though she never accepted any customers whatsoever.
I won't sit through it again though.
She was a successful courtesan , though was known more for her eroticism and sensuality rather for her stunning classic beauty.
It's drudge though, is at least paced by the regular, strong performance that Mitchum's put through in every movie I remember ever seeing him in.
-- Then again, though it's story could be from a Danielle Steel paperback, the acting was pretentious at its best, and never ever provoked a single feeling in me but awkwardness and embarrassment, it had those spectacular big display scenes Americans like so much, and costumes.
Cinematography 100% though: it makes you weep.
This is one of my favorite rides, even though it is not in any sense a great ride, nor is it one of the better attractions that Lucas worked on with Disney, EO of course being his best.
The X-wings you see in this attraction violate the laws of the Star Wars universe, because they launch to hyperspace in attack position  *END SPOILER*   The flaws aside though, this is a fun ride for the whole family that actually brings some characters from the movie in, though you wont see any Jedi battles, as this is a flight simulator which takes you on a rough space trip, to an explosive ending.
The attraction is a decent, if not great ride, and even though the only character in ride you see is R2, you will still hear some memorable quotes, and see memorable faces during the preflight safety videos.
(I love it when the woman and the security guard suspect a killer is in the multi-story building and the guard insists she stay in the lab with the door locked while he checks the place out, even though the door to the lab has a flimsy glass window on it).
Particularly Ted's character is good for a couple of laughs, as he sees himself as God's gift to women even though he's the most annoying Star Wars nerd imaginable.
I read the back cover, and even though Joey Lawrence of Blossom fame (if you could call it that) was in it, I decided to give it a try, just for once, to pick a movie, that might be one of those that might just surprise me in being a good movie.
In my opinion, if a horror movie gets confused halfway through what it wants to do, becoming a slasher flick, though cheap (and I sure as hell ain't bashing slasher flicks, they're the most fun to make fun of), at least it can be entertaining.
Perhaps my least favorite facet, though, was the writing.
This even though she lived next to a lake all that time!
To my surprise though, about a half hour into it, the story completely changed, and became this drivel about the main character selling his stud services to impregnate successful lesbians for $10,000 a pop.
The drama looks fake to me, but I liked the ending, though.
I will say one thing though, the torture scene with the drill to the knee, is pretty cool, but doesn't go any further than in the trailer.
I don't think it's supposed to though.
Even though this was trying to bring out the point of the film, the characters mixed emotions deep down of who he actually was.
I got the feeling that Bale's character would have been an sociopath in any case - though probably not as suicidal.
I can't blame the writers too much, though -- this being written in 1942, a bad year for the Allies.
I'd sure like to know where to get a coat like that, though.
The film assumes she is who she says she is (even though there is still no empirical evidence.)
This didn't come as that much of a surprise, though, as when the movie began it said that the film was based on the plays of William Gillette--not the Doyle stories.
Unrealistic, boring, packed with low action tricks, very emotionless as a drama though dealing with such a painful topic.
For me this has been the worst and very annoying performance of Cate Blanchett since the Bandits, though she is one of my favorites.
I really wish that this genre of 'tragic true story' could be wiped from the face of this earth - nothing makes me more sick than to see what could essentially be a moving (though I'm rarely moved, especially where 'the media' and its monkey-slaves are concerned) story ripped to pieces and turned into a vomit-inducing cheesefest of a film.
Platoon isn't a favourite of mine either even though its rated high.
Oliver Stone did make Platoon pretty well though but it doesn't even close to Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan or We Were Soldiers.
The film is still reasonably fun though because it is so cheesy and they have some clichÃ©d and hokey drama in it that is so badly done you can't help but laugh.
This however is an embarrassment to independent film makers everywhere, as though a bunch of drunk sixth formers had run amok with a camera.
The director must have though 3/4 of the film in, that he'd like to have a crazy killer in the movie.
The acting, though not great, was certainly acceptable (apart from the navigator).
Many other such things happened, some even more ridiculous, such as venting the entire oxygen supply into a fire so it will burn faster, with no real reason given exactly why they would want that, though "We'll cross that bridge" was a personal favourite.
None of that matters though, because at the end it turns into "There's a madman on the ship!!!!"
Another random ranting: Even though the film's makers and supporters yodel to all and sundry about how their marvelous picture-show manages to get by without any aliens or supernatural elements, "Sunshine"'s third-act mystery killer is not only super-duper strong (okay: so maybe toting the admittedly, erm, fine-boned Cillian Murphy around by the throat would realistically call only for "reasonably strong," no "super" or "duper" about it), he's completely immune to wild extremes of heat and cold.
"; then he removes from their silly huge open vat of cooling liquid the ship's preposterously big computer components and suffers not the least touch of frostbite-- even though frostbite fatally mauls the poor schmuck saddled with the task of re-dunking those components.
Even though it's rare to see a movie so lovingly misconceived, you'd be wise to give this a miss.
It's low-budget dreck, that is certain--but through its persistent incoherence, it kept my attention, even though the one feeling I had when the credits started to roll was absolute indifference.
Director Brian Yuzna's camera angles are inventive at first, but the music-video edits occur so regularly that they become annoying after a while; yet perhaps the one thing "Faust" can hold to its name are the impressive special effects (impressive for such an obviously low-budget production), even though I'm of the opinion that people shouldn't even bother adapting comic books to film.
Really though, either story in this film is worth watching.
Nonetheless, Nilsson does get to perform a number of good tunes during the course of the film (though stymied by the poor sound quality of the edition I watched!)
Shot in the Phillipines on the cheap, starring a bunch of nobodies and featuring John Carradine's most forgettable screen appearance as Count Dracula [though sharply outfitted with a white linen suit complete with Panama hat; he looks great!
At points the editing, angles and distance of the shots worked together to make me feel as though I was seeing this urban painting through the window of a passing train: quick snippets.
This is an absolutely horrible movie (though still better than both Queerwolf and On Deadly Ground (best use of Michael Caine's hair to sop up oil spills)).
What makes it really watchable though, are the performances.
It begins and finishes on an upbeat note, but the leaden handling drags its midsection down, even though the cast is quite good.
The crew of the submarine Lorelei believe that they are fighting for their homeland and the future of Japan and hence sacrifice themselves at the end of the movie by surfacing on the water (even though the area is surrounded by US fleets) so that they can take down the US airplane which was carrying the third atom bomb heading for another drop in Japan.
This has all the hallmarks of a disastrous inside joke; though the characters are supposed to be quirky, lovable oafs they're never actually written to be anything other than 2-dimensional pastiches each equipped with one tragic flaw and completely irrelevant emotional baggage.
By the way, though it was probably NOT intended, in the scene towards the very end of the film my family and I laughed because by the way the dialog was written there sure seemed to be a gay subtext.
While the plot had possibilities, there is very little going on here and none of it is terribly funny - despite the support of Edward Chapman (the first of 5 collaborations with Wisdom) and cameos by Margaret Rutherford (playing a dotty millionairess with a passion for animals) and Jerry Desmonde (his unbilled split-second appearance, though, is more of an in-joke than anything else)!
Assemble a cast too physically unappealing (and too sleazy) to get work in the porn industry even though their acting skills are on that level.
He seems more concerned with nonpolitical philosophy though, generally speaking.
He overcame though, darn it.
I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and I was a fan of the Donnie & Marie Show...However, even though I was only 15 when I saw it, I was shocked and disappointed at how bad this film was.
It felt more like an essay than a movie; rather than chronological development it was as though a point was made and evidenced and then moved on to the next point - I much preferred the chronological growth of the characters in the series.
DARWAZA BANDH RAKHO is Chakravarthi's 2nd directional film after the flop DURGA and a small story in DBR  The film is a comedy fitted in 1 house which is novel but sadly the film falters as it progresses  The film starts off well but several comedy scenes are dragged and too chaostic  Yet there are several interesting scenes but the romance could be done without The film gets engrossing in the second half where lot of game plans are revealed but the climax is a bad joke  Direction by Chakravarthi is decent Camera-work is good  Aftab Shivdasani is in good form and acts his part very well though he doesn't get much scope to display histrionics Isha Sherwani annoys at places otherwise she is good Chunky Pandey is relegated to the backseat, Manisha Koirala is okay Snehal Dabbi is adequate Zakir is superb in his role Ishrat Ali is the scene stealer, he excels in his comic act He mostly is seen as a loud politician in action films but here he is superb Smita Jaikar and others are good
I do think that there were some good comedies in the 1970's, though, and these include Dad's Army (although after James Beck's death these were considerably weaker, relying on slapstick from Clive Dunn and to a lesser extent Arthur Lowe) but of course, this was really a 2060's comedy; altogether a different era of quality.
The idea that women's worth is to be measured on the basis of her looks (though admitting we can sometimes be wrong about it)????
all in all i wish a x x o and f x g would watch some of the films there palming off onto the unsuspecting download public.Naomi watts looks good though!
It is being suggested that even though the film contains hardly (if any) entertainment value, it should be accepted because of its artistic quality.
Strangely that works out perfectly and we get to know everything about it, even though the movie actually doesn't spend much time explaining, it's just done so well and perfectly direct that we basically know everything about these two when the movie ends.
In the end you care about no one involved and you are left feeling the conclusion (though there really is none) is totally unsatisfactory.
The violence contained in the film is never shown though the effects of the violence and its remnants are displayed prominently.
Naomi Watts is wasted though she is able to show a great deal of emotion and is used for her looks as an arousal tool.
Seriously though, it's a pretty cool story that would have been more successful as a novel.
As a result, the films, though popular in their day, were just awful by today's standards.
Obviously not these two sexaholics (though none of their sex scenes could ignite a candle).
Even McCarthy's funeral scene is  messed up, as Sutherland thinks about McCarthy's murder, even  though he was not there.
What really slowed the series down to a crawl was the need to force certain other characters back into the plot, even though they no longer had any purpose, and should in fact have died in the season finale.
I tune in for a good laugh at how crappy the content can get, and I'm amazed when the viewers actually find something to theorize about- why bother as it's probably going to be explained... Usually they're right though, but as all fingers pointed to the conclusion...
Even though Patton was killed shortly after the end of WWII, it is hard not to notice that in The Last Days of Patton, G.C.
If their message was " Lets watch porn" and "screw sin" I get it.As I am an Atheist I am grateful for such miserable "Christians"; opening our eyes to what religion has become, a device of self-worship, self-indulgence and though being corrupt considering yourself holy.
After his shoes break in the last game of the year, he quits after the game even though the team made the playoffs?
I've done things that can be interpreted as anti-mainstream-religion and pro-Satanist in my own artwork (even though it's not meant quite that simply).
This is one of those type of movies you watch, and when you leave you get pissed at the movie theater employees, even though they relatively had nothing to do with why you're mad.
The movie itself revolved around some historical battles and politics which are really unknown for me, and even though mr Amirkulov pointed out before the film began that we in the audience could expect some obscure historical talk in the film, i was surprised about the lack of many things in the movie.
Typical idiot writers portray it as though it's the hysterical women (Laci's two friends) who think Scott is guilty and the cops who are after Scott.
This was English dubbed though.
some very badly written dialogue (though to be fair, the movie is dubbed, so maybe the translation lost something) we find out that the main evil guy from the first movie wants to restart the medical experiments.
No, for some reason they don't, even though they were all there the first time.
There is, however, some unintentional humor (though NOT worth watching the movie for-if the forthcoming description of the unintentional humor amuses you at all , just LEAVE IT AT THAT.
They force feed it to him, though it looks more like they just rubbed it into his teeth, he foams at the mouth a little, and dies.
The only positive things about this wretched excuse for an exploitation movie are that it leaves out the suspiciously realistic, unnecessary scenes of animal cruelty included in the first one, and that it has the guts to have a downbeat ending (though again, it's just a really inept rip-off of the first movie).
Even though I swore to myself I would never lay eyes again on 'Men behind the Sun' or any of its sequels, I am now reviewing part 2.
The 'Men behind the Sun' franchise might as well be the most controversial and shocking series of films ever made (maybe a tie with the 'Guinea Pig' series, though) and handles about despicably explicit experiments performed on prisoners in a Japanese army base during WWII.
There are aspects that do make one think, though.
Male viewers will probably have to derive what enjoyment they can from observing some very pretty and/or very talented actors, though in a far from ideal vehicle.
Character development is superb, and even though Stuart and De Souza leave some loose ends untied - like how a man gets hung with a chain and still comes back for more - the film remains to be an action classic.
Perhaps this explains why there were considerable leaps from reality, hoping the viewer would not mind the 'jumps & jerks' from what was supposed to be a realistic 'peek' at the unique world of 'witches' even though they be of good heart and purpose.
There's maybe one good though lurid scene in this and that isn't enough to make sitting through the movie to see.
The level of the dialogs remain though at the level of porno films.
It's just that the movie is boggled down with so many sports and rags-to-riches movie clichÃ©s that by the end, the movie seems far from original even though the premise is.
After reading some of the positive comments about it though I am really shocked that some people enjoyed this.
The substantial profit garnered by this movie prompted production of three sequels, each continuing the amourous adventures of young Will and his trusty spy cameras, and even though their potential merits cannot be determined by this viewer, the first number in the series does provide an unexpected element of suspense in addition to capable costuming from Ha Nguyen, fine stunt performing, and a polished turn from Carr.
Babies will probably have a good time watching this, though some parts may be too scary.
Other than the music and voices though, this is an utterly ridiculous movie.
Still though, the animation is beautiful, but it doesn't make up for how many faults are in the film.
Instead, the character encounters no real hardship even though he is appears to be staggering around ineffectually, and even appears to outrun people on horses who catch him supposedly trying to steal cows?
The film still is all about the images though, and right from the start you know it's a Tsukamoto when you see his trademark: Maggots eating some rotten flesh.
This is not his best work though.
They try to put some energy into it though so that helps, but most of the people in here just have little to no acting skills whatsoever.
Having said that, some of the music â particularly the childrenâs choruses â is quite pleasing, though...
Seriously though, I couldn't help but think about how good of a anime movie this would have made.
The action sequences are awful, looking as though they were choreographed by a drunk homeless man the crew picked up off the streets of Tokyo.
The writing is done in similar fashion, though perhaps "drunk homeless man" gives too much credit to the writing team.
Also, the movie looks as though it were assembled of entirely first takes.
Sword sound effects that sound as though they were ripped straight from the first season of the "Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers" TV show.
While excessive blood is usually funny in a movie of this style, in this case it feels as though they are trying to pass it off as serious.
Now the story is decent, though not as great as it could have been.
There are some good things about the movie though.
I actually feel a little bad reviewing this because I feel I'm only advertising it somewhat...like a lot of people curiosity got the better of me after reading the reviews...I have to say though it's a work of genius from the director to film a LOW low budget film and then come on here and deny he knew what the final cut of the film looked like...that had me on the floor...what great directing that is...
You have to agree with me here though: Lion's Gate made this film look like it was a serial killer slasher/ horror film, and for that they are total jerks!
It's just randomly thrown in there because the director though he had to put it in there somewhere.
They also discuss how the past victims were all killed outside of their homes, which apparently brings them a sense of safety...even though none of the windows are locked, these women seem 100% convinced that the murderer is not going to break-in and kill them.
None of it went towards a script rewrite though.
The problem with the movie though is that it takes itself too seriously when it's obvious it benefitted the most from the unintentional comedy.
This is the tenth film featuring Spanish horror star Paul Naschy that Iâve watched; though best-known for his series of âWaldemar Daninskyâ werewolf movies, he made all kinds of genre efforts â even scripting many of them himself under real name Jacinto Molina.
Naschy, by the way, plays three roles here (though one of them, a horned demon, is only featured in a sequence depicting the heroineâs nightmare) â another finds the star at his most Brando-like (albeit inspired by the Method actorâs variable stint in the psychedelic star-studded concoction CANDY [1968]!)
Andrew Dice Clay has an amusing cameo, though.
Perhaps that's part of the problem then, because in every film version I've seen (save, perhaps, for the Jeremy Brett Granada one, where the hound looked as though it merely wanted a Milk-Bone and a nice tummy rub), scriptwriters can't resist the temptation to add dubious "improvements" to Sir Arthur's masterwork.
So so plot though, the beast within, Jekyll and Hyde, Janus, that sort of thing.
The BBC have previously had good luck with the tale - both their Peter Cushing and Tom Baker versions, studio-bound though they were, were more involving in their cosy Sunday teatime way.
Even though I haven't seen the American version of this show, and have no wish to, it does beg the question, why can't American TV execs watch a British comedy without saying "that's a good programme, very popular, lets do it ourselves" And ruin it.
Even in the most tranquil image, the director creates a sense of palpable menace, as though the air is tinged with the smells of blood and gore even though the shot may be of a perfectly kept garden.
It is also interesting that even though this film barely clocks in at an hour and twenty minutes, it feels like it goes on for an eternity.
The fourth Massacre movie is much easier to sit through, even though it's one of the strangest, dumbest, worst movies of all time.
All the action scenes were well shot, though nothing spectacular.
The trailer was kinda cool though.
I must admit, though, that I got it as a present at a Christmas present, and it was a hoot at the party.
I should say something about the characters though.
For sheer wackiness though, you have to check out the dragon dance performed by the High Priestess and her court.
This story is set on the mythical islands of Wongo and Guna and it seems as though the gene pool has played one dirty trick.
The acting is poor, no story line (...even though I knew that there was not going to be much of one), the script was shocking and the jokes, which the film all about, simply NOT FUNNY.
I am not sure why this movie caught my attention though, usually I would loose interest fast and stop watching.
Thank god for Italian film-making though, as bad as this turd is they put out out some other great stuff.
I can still feel this film in my blood, though it must be 20 years since I last saw it.
His delivery made him sound as though he was slightly impaired somehow.
Let's begin with the fact that most of its ninjas are white, even though that some are Chinese.
All I was getting was just a bunch of vaguely connected quotes about a vaguely defined subject and wild praise of someone I had been told nothing significant about who had apparently done something amazing, though what exactly that something was remained foggy.
Movies like 'Less Than Zero' (more so in Bret Easton Ellis' novel than the movie, though) and 'Bonfire of the Vanities' and other similarly themed movies presents one class of people, wealthy apathetic socialites who exist in a state of perpetual uselessness.
when i saw the trailer to this film i had high hopes and then when i found out that Mark Jones was behind it i figured it would be good i loved the first leprechaun but even though the trailer was good sadly thats about the only good thing about the film, it trys to hard to be funny and you just start feeling sorry a quarter of the way through asking yourself why am i still watching this maybe it might get better I've seen it all the way and let me answer that question with a big no.
Goddard is pretty good though--he (wisely) underplays his role.
Altogether, though I didn't hate this film as some have, I can't really recommend it, it tries hard but it just doesn't work, and its meagre bright spots and smattering of fun ideas don't really make it worthwhile.
No sex scene, though - this is an action picture!
It's pathetic, Americans once again trying to rewrite history so its looks as though they have gained a victory from the tragic events, you lost, accept it as a tragedy please.
He is released into the general population (though obviously still unbalanced) and becomes the prime suspect in a series disappearances and murders among high school faculty and students.
Cutting Class certainly makes sure to pack in all the standard genre clichÃ©s, with red herrings and misleading clues a plenty (hands up who though that sodium chloride would actually save the day: I know I did), but veers awkwardly between silly humour (Paula's bumbling dad somehow surviving to the end of the film) and genuine attempts at horror (the killing of the school's vice principal), delivering crappy gore featuring patently rubber props and uninspired direction along the way.
Being a fan of fantasy films, I was enchanted by the story and characters, though it was over 40 years before i saw it again.
My favorite plot point is Bobby's aspiration to become an Olympic roller skating gold medalist...even though no one tells him it isn't an Olympic event.
Innately geeky, the never-to-be-seen-again Bray certainly tries hard, though he is defeated by the film's numerous skating sequences which have been inserted so we can be impressed by his expertise.
As for characters, I do not see a male character I like enough to want to be...And though there are some attractive females none of them seem very desirable after a short while.
But it is a very elegant movie, and along the way you become quite sympathetic, even though all the stories describe infidelity and frigid bourgeous lives.
The leftwing always tries to hide its bloody face behind anti-war/anti-American probanganda - but when they are at power, they become the most hateful and cold killers, though the hide behind that they are doing it to people who have the wrong opinion.
Today, Goths and all-around weird people (like myself) enjoy his work, though I will admit it's an acquired taste!
The acting is wooden and unnatural, and the music, which is supposed to be awesome, sounds curiously like a bad rip-off of Springsteen, even though the flashbacks in the film are set, for the most part, in 1963, when NOTHING sounded like Springsteen.
And Johnny, though successful at times, still seems like a major amateur.
Steve, too, though a disgusting character, is hardly real.
I can still only give it 4/10 though.
There are some interesting historical breakthroughs on display though.
Unlike the Wonga movie, this has a little personality, and though it's ultimately stupid in every way, it has some charm.
Hitchcock uses point-of-view shots to powerful effect, and Cotten Â though not called upon to do much in the way of acting Â delivers a creepy monotone voice-over that communicates his overwhelming paranoia.
Abe realises though that after saving the people he did, days later they commit an act that kills many others, so he knows that Sherry must die also, but in the end, he ends up dying himself and saves her as a spirit.
Even though we were kept in suspense to who's setting the forest fires for the first half of the movie it wasn't a surprise at all the Tiny was the culprit!
Even though he was supposed to be the life of the party, or movie, Tiny for all his efforts in being another indestructible super villain came across as a man who spent too much time out in the sun.
Don't overlook the first five minutes even though it's an uneventful set-up for what follows.
Because there we understand that Cotton really does deserve to suffer some poetic justice, extreme though it is.
Keep your eyes on Cruise though.
The most memorable one of these is the final segment with the husband and wife stuck in the elevator, though they all were well acted and interesting.
I wouldn't say that this film is a waste of time though.
The acting was generally pretty bad, though Best wasn't too bad.
And though I really TRIED to like it, as it had been recommended to me, there were times it just bored me silly.
Even though He does karate in a way that makes people wonder "Why is he wearing those Things?"
I did like the part, though, when that dyke's body splits in half just because she smashes into a tree branch, that part was both stupid and hilarious at the same time!
As it stands on film, though, they either showed the emotions of a cardboard cut out or thrashed about in over-the-top fashion.
When i was watching it at one point i though i was watching, wrong turn, then i star thinking about the Texas chainsaw massacre, then hills have eyes and finally i know what you did last summer, the movie it's basically a mix of all these other movies but unsuccessfully did what those other movies did, it's just so predictable, the scrip it's so weak and far beyond scary, instead of that it's so lame, with this thousands of clichÃ©s like "don't go in there" "what it's this place" "he's gonna kill us all" you basically know who's gonna die first and why called it "the butcher" there is no butcher in the film and there is not even a good slaughter, they should have call it "i know what the Texas hills wrong turned last summer" or something, honestly i don't know what a company spend money into making this crappy films.
But really, though I didn't like this movie, and there were a lot of things that bugged me about it, it wasn't really anything terrible.
By the halfway point, I had this film in my liked column, but then it just went on and on and on, in fact, even though I have left the theater, I still think the film is running.
To be honest though, the whole film is a spoiler so just don't bother.
Total crapola post production sound job leads to more laughs and they try real hard to use sounds that don't match the picture, it's like they only have one FX CD just had to make it work for everything--though there is very little in the way of polish on any level.
So, even though you won't want to watch it, you could at least see the action.
Even though his character is the most vile, evil, manipulative, and ultimately unlikeable person in the entire film, he still manages to give an awesome performance and show what acting is all about.
Technically, I am a Boomer, though at the time when all the "idealistic youths" of the '60s were reading Marx, burning their draft cards, and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in grade school.
But the penny drops the more the film goes on when you realise it's not meant to be a serious film and couldn't have been made by a serious film maker   The plot revolves around a woman called Bella who moves to Brighton and is the victim of a stalker who phones her when she's alone , though the stalker is both written and played in such an over the top manner that he's somewhat difficult to take seriously .
I must admit, I did laugh lots... though probably not for any of the reasons the film's makers intended.
When they get to after they meet the eagles I though they had skipped a part of the movie.
How anyone survived the water for over 10 minutes no one knows, but it is true that at least 6 person's were pulled alive and stayed alive, after this time though originally 150 were pulled out still alive but died and were buried at sea by the rescue ship Carparthia.
I knew the film was pretty poor before I bought it, that was another reason to get it though, some poor films can be quite entertaining.
Personally,I didn't see a single boom shot in the whole extravaganza.There were some shots that were incredibly out of focus,but it turned out they were deliberate choices by the filmmakers.Parts of this film are actually wickedly funny,as all horror films should be.I couldn't help thinking though while watching this film that it might have actually been quite terrifying if the babies just looked like real babies!
And it's not as though this kid accidentally discovers her plan or anything like that, oh noÂhe just happens to be the only known survivor (other than the physco lady) of this strain of virus in the whole world.
Megan Gallagher is the only actor/actress in this movie that's actually believable even though Debbie Ann Thomas (Nurse Washington) was extremely good for the little she acted.
The flow of the movie was actually decent though.
This movie is unbelievable though.
The acting I think could have been a lot better, I mean one of the main characters, Dr. Landis, couldn't even cry she looked as though she was in pain with a two tears.
The majority of the plot was just absurdÂthough the theme would have made a good movie perhaps under better direction and with better actors, this creation of Contagion was not only disappointing but silly as well.
All in all, though, "Contagion" is a very weak movie.
It effectively shows many of the conventions of the period though it does so through a familiar stilted manner--in the way that an 18th and early 19th century gentleman of privileged means would want one to portray his or her time.
There is no evidence that Pitt ever offered him a place in his government though Wilberforce allied himself with his friend.
The grouchy Daffy Duck is the natural choice for Scrooge: with the premise updated to modern times, many of the familiar Looney Tunes figures turn up Â atypically Â as submissive employees in Daffy's department store (that said, Bugs Bunny is his usual independent self, though he serves no particular function here except to further harass Daffy!).
It's a close call though.
In most cases, though, it was just potty humor that even 6th graders would find too juvenile to merit watching.
Even the baseball scenes were sub-par, though our 5-year-old "heavy hitter" did enjoy them.
Definitely not for everyone, though one could say the makers have been bold enough to make a movie about this subject.
I rated this 2 out of 10, though, because of a pretty cool soundtrack, and because "Dorothy" was kinda cute.
No scandalous scenes in this one though, just plain pretension and showing off.
I imagine the creatures would be queued in right after the couple promises to survive for one another and hang on no matter what even though they fought non-stop for the first 100 minutes of the movie just like Bud and Lindsay.
First off, the cast has the same racial make up as USA for Africa with a Latino girl hanging out with an Asian girl, a black girl, and what I originally thought was some lost member of the Russian Aristocricy but ended up being poor even though she had a huge house and her introduction to the movie dealt w/ her enormous shoe collection: funny, a movie that tries to break down walls still has plenty of stereotypes.
Even though this IS based on a line of dolls, it could have been good.
So I give this movie a 1, though it should get a 0!
It was my first Bing Crosby film and though I thought he was okay in it I have to say the only reason for me has to be Donald.
even though we're in high school, we were expecting to find something that we'd be able to watch, but instead we found ourselves laughing hysterically at every single word that came out of each character's mouth.
the storyline jumped all over the place, beginning with the girls entering their freshman years, then all of a sudden it flashes "two years later", and we're supposed to believe they're juniors, even though they look exactly the same and have no physical change whatsoever.
Meredith - even though a freshman - has divided the entire academy into clicks (emo's, skaters, geeks, potheads, jocks, tree-huggers and other assorted losers).
This movie is that decent thing you're looking for; though not amazing, not even great... Two Came Back isn't bad and is a substantial watch.
Don't let this ruin it for you, though.
I don't recommend spending your money on it though; usually a TV station will show it every once in a while.
(3) One other of the Traveler's ideas has philosophical parallels to panpsychism though, which is the idea that intelligence exists all through nature.
There is a bright side to this movie, though shallow it very much is.
"Chopping Mall" is by far better than most movies he's made, though it still isn't great.
There's a nice cast of familiar genre faces (including Barbara Crampton and an amusing cameo by Dick Miller as a cranky janitor), a corny electronic 80's score, and I'll admit the robot effects are actually pretty well done on a low budget (though I did find the robot design to be a little too cute to be threatening).
Clocking in at a brisk 77 minutes, "Chopping Mall" isn't a bad way to waste some time if you're a horror fan, though there are better killer robot flicks out there (See Terminator 2 and 3, Moontrap or even the 1997 box-office bomb, Virus).
So, in one of the only amusing developments, one of the women goes all princessy and needs a smoke, of a certain brand, before she can start putting out (though it seemed like they already had done it, andÂ I don't understand).
Viewers today though will be able to see how unbelievable it really is.
CM has a certain 80s charm - though by "charm" I definitely don't mean the horrendous overly blonde hair-dos or the ultra-skinny women.
While he allows her to get pregnant by another man, Sir Clifford insists that the man with whom she copulates be someone he approves of, though in the end she never reveals to him who her true lover is.
I am glad I read up on the film here, though, because when I watched it I thought Oosh's brother was "Doosh."
Incredibly, though, I saw it one night on television, on some kind of syndicated "action theatre" network.
- Bertrand wanted to film something slow like a painting, to make the audience feel as though they are watching moving images.
Minor spoilers below:  - Bertrand had less direction for Marc Barbe, but she did ask him to not play his scenes with Kurylenko like he wanted to seduce her, even though the character seems to know exactly what she needs.
All though may not have been the best idea it has a real life feel to it.
Appropriate for older children (12 and up), though there are several scenes that contain violence.
The judge who presided over Haley's plagiarism case admitted that "I did not want to destroy him" and so allowed him to settle quietly - even though, he acknowledged, Haley had repeatedly perjured himself in court.
Only Darrell Hammond and Dave Foley are worth watching, even though Foley is tragically underused yet again.
Unfortunately, though, since these are new creatures the filmmakers spend most of the movie explaining to us who they are, their history, their likes and dislikes, how they live, how they die, etc.
Throughout the rest, though, it felt like a big inside joke that I wasn't in on.
Some scenes though are rather gory such as the flashback scene where they show how the kid managed to escape, but in the end these scenes are too few and far between.
There isn't much excitement in the plot, but I appreciate the variation in weapons though, that kept the mood lively.
I was lying, this film is pretty awful even though a scene in a doctors waiting room is quite freaky.
Almost as though someone pulled some "favor" to get her into this film.
I give the film two stars, though I'm not sure it deserves it.
Come to think of it though...there are no women in the entire film.
The producers of this film apparently saw the Matrix and a handful of vampire films (though I believe this shlock actually predates Underworld) and thought to themselves "Hey guys...let's take these ideas and then throw them in a blender with feces, slap it in front of a camera and see what happens."
The ending though...ahh, the ending.
The parents hate each other, joined together only to get through this, even though they fight terribly.
The plot, though slow is tense, holding an audience's attention throughout.
What I most liked about this film was the sense of realness, as I watched it(though the language was English) I felt that somehow I was in fact watching an actually documentary as it unfolded.
While it does end OK (I guess, even though it's sort of doggie incest), I personally was disgusted by the unhappy nature of this movie.
It was also rather dull, at times though, maybe it's because I'm not a major baseball fan either so I wasn't that into that part of it.
Even though, I can appreciate it's appeal, I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped.
The script and the acting were pretty deplorable and the direction was anything but tight, though still one can sort of envisage what was intended; and those stolen fleeting glimpses serve to supply enough motive to keep watching.
The mysterious killer is also there, he most definitely resists arrest & even though Grant repeatedly shoots him he kills Phil by biting his neck.
Even though it is meant to be set in the future the cars, clothes & the like suggest otherwise.
Unfortunately, some modern, especially Danish movies suffer from Hollywoodization and though some can be good (like Klatretosen) they don't belong to the great tradition, they don't succeed the great movies from former decades.
Much like other people here, I was disgusted by the superficial and petty characters (even though at first glance the story lines appear to offer some good values).
And naturally, since the plot demands it, the most virginal female character just *must* "fall in love" with him, even though she recognizes his purely evil nature.
One scene though when Kevin (I think) gets all red in the face, that`s fun!
I seriously doubt that,at the age of 66,I fall within the audience - range that "Kevin and Perry go large" was intended for.However I am an admirer of Mr H.Enfield and Mr P.Whitehouse and enjoyed "Harry Enfield and friends" and "The Fast Show",precursors of the dreadful "Little Britain".Sacrilegious though it may be I prefer Messrs Enfield and Whitehouse to those appallingly over - rated Pythons and I sincerely hope that they do not fall into the trap Cleese and co. failed to avoid i.e.endlessly re - cycling the same old stuff with only the names changed to protect the Swiss bank accounts.With "K & P" the signs were not good,but seven years down the line it remains the sole attempt by Mr E and Mr W to squeeze a few more bob out of their former TV audiences and I applaud them for their restraint.
The real star of the film, though, is the script.
Compared to series films like Charlie Chan, The Falcon or Crime Doctor, this one just didn't seem as well written--though the prison setting was exciting and the dialog and action there was good enough to make this an agreeable time-passer.
Well that is interesting that this was supposed to be a sequel to that movie, though it most definitely does not play out like the famous cartoon at all.
Still though, in the end it boils down to a fight between Van Dame and the bad guy, in the rain.
The film is a sort of cross between an adventure film and a nasty cannibal flick, though it's not as nasty as the genre's "big" films, and the adventure side of it doesn't work too well either considering that the film is completely boring!
You'll be bored to tears (and frustrated as hell) with Cannibal Holocaust II, so only see it if you're a cannibal completionist (though this isn't a cannibal movie, per-se) or are incredibly curious beyond belief.
THere are other random crap this movie tosses around, though I must admit the final scene did have me 'like wt?'
Even though his life is on the line in every adventure, he still makes it very entertaining and sometimes adds a little humor into it to.
Even though this movie is based on actual events and Pierre Dulaine (which is inspirational in itself and commendable), does not mean I necessarily want to see the same thing rehashed with different names, places and dates.
And what gets folded in is "real" life, real passion (supposedly, though who believes kids can know anything about passion?).
It's still on though even though during a recent live Halloween investigation it became clear that head investigator Grant was guilty of trying to pass off a fake voice and on the same show tried making it seem like his jacket was pulled on by a ghost, when it was clear he was doing it himself by something rigged in his pocket.
Acting: I think Cardona (Gonzalo) though not outstanding, is the only one who achieves a little touch of truthfulness to his character, showing himself as someone careless and incapable of commitment.
The third one, though?
Some comments:  Camera - Awful Screenplay - Awful "Acting" - Horrific example Sound - Poor Script - Typical of a budget action/thriller film (though I believe this movie falls into a genre of its own)  Junk-o-Rama, in other words.
It's still a very interesting movie though, I'd rate it a lot higher then this if dialogues and acting was better.
The only positive thing that can be said about this film is the quasi-inspiration, though prototypical, premise of sticking together and weathering the storm.
Psycho hangs over this film more obviously, though, with a sinister mother character, a wimpy young man, voyeurism - and a psychoesque murder, as well as music clearly stolen from Psycho's shower scene.
So, even though I'm not keen to watch the movie again, I would like to see the TV trailers for it!
It's as though the film makers are embarrassed to be making Science Fiction, and try their hardest to hide the fact.
I've heard people saying it is a simple story though i din' found it simple rather i found it irritating.
The color is strong though.
The sores that later appeared on Montenegro are also kinda cool (though watching him transform was just plain silly).
Plus, the naked ladies were rather attractive--though this makes this far from a family-friendly flick.
No fingerprints appeared to have been taken or checked for (even though at the denouement it could clearly be seen that "dabs" were left all over said murder scene), and any reference to or collection of written statements were completely overlooked.
It was considerably short of that, and one is left to wonder why this re-make was ever produced, and with all due respect to Geraldine McEwan, magnificent actress though she is, the late Joan Hickson still reigns supreme as Jane Marple.
She performs the character as though she has never read a description of the woman, and fails in so many places where Hickson succeeded.
The characer "Wet" has a faded scar in one scene; a few scenes later another character is commenting on how she just got a bad scar on her face from a beating, then, minutes later (days later in movie-speak), her scars are all red a fresh, even though she had them way before the mention of any beating.
The cast was pretty good, though, especially the actor who played Mike.
Even though there is blood and guts aplenty, Leather Jackets is a decidedly unvisceral thriller.
Sometimes the film overcomes this bit of illogic, though more often it just derails the film's credibility completely because it inadvertently reminds you that you are, indeed, watching a movie.
But while Cronenberg's vision of picture postcard Medford, Indiana is archetypically American enough (though actually filmed in Canada), his villains are pure central casting stereotypes.
And worse, though Tom repeatedly risks his life to protect his family, his wife and son turn against him at the drop of a plot twist (how better to show that the prototypical happy American family is an illusion!).
Mortensen was okay, though it seemed like he was repeating every other sentence that came out of his mouth.
Overall though, this was a very disappointing movie, both as a fan of Mark Hamill, and as a comic book fan.
The film is adequately directed, though Miranda's commercial roots are definitely showing, but the merits of "Skills" don't earn the hype.
OK in this case it is not taken too far but it still feels false and as though it has been added in just to keep the lady's in the audience happy (or rather the Hollywood executive's idea of what will make lady's in the audience happy).
I rated it two out of ten because the actor Ryan Carnes has a lot of charisma, though he isn't well-directed here.
Then we are taken to another level here when the phones ring and is Caleb's flatmate (Jim Verranos) who can't honestly act (sorry to say this, sounds like a nice guy though) and the very hard to take Gwen, Marc's flatmate.
It seemed like he was inspired more by television sitcoms, though.
There is a phone sex scene which IS really well done, though, and it feels like the rest of the movie is just a sloppy construction designed to frame that scene.
In spite of being cute and all, though, the character of Kyle is utterly self-loathing and just a miserable, bitchy queen.
As for the rather abrupt ending, I find it a bit of a stretch that the geeky self-hating boy would, after one horrible dinner in which he basically pouted the whole time, land the ferociously hot, model-esquire party boy Marc, who apparently instantly forgets all about his major crush on Caleb and acts as though he's been pining away for Kyle all this time.
WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS (though you may thank me for them later).
Across the way, in another highrise, are a couple whom I gather are supposed to represent the Aristocrat and his Mistress, though it's hard to imagine an Aristocrat living in what is basically a pre-fab apartment complex.
Later that day, Masturbating Woman and Mistress have sex again, though we are never quite sure in who's apartment.
No matter though because soon the S&M freaks produce blood-drenched whips and proceed to lash Masturbating Woman's naked body, streaking it red with ketchup stains.
Looking at the way the majority of the cuts appear on screen this would seem the case, though on the other hand it could just be a bad movie.
If you think I`m apologising for the Serbs I`m not , try and track down news reports at the time , go into a libary with a large archive and look through newspaper reports from 1992 to 1994 , read accounts like The Fall Of Yugoslavia by Mish Glenny , talk to British soldiers who were there and you`ll find out little of the crimes ( And they were crimes ) were done by Serbs though they were guilty of terrible crimes elsewhere in the region   This annoyance is not only down to ignoring facts , it`s also down to director Peter Kosminsky trying to set some hidden agenda .
It's sort of cool though how this is set up like old serials.
It has some qualities as an action adventure, though it comes off as a cheap imitation of a cross between the Robin Hood story and Monty Python and the Holy Grail (a silly movie that works, at least for most guys, in a way that the Three Stooges do not); shame on Peter Cook.
Because Mr. Dylan seems more interested in getting smashed out of his skull on something or other while Lennon - no stranger to drugs himself though much more composed on this occasion - comes across as cool, while his co-passenger Mr. Dylan is slurring his words, making little sense, and gradually becoming so ill to the point of needing to vomit into the camera.
This nauseated "limo ride" is not actually part of the "finished" film (it only includes several seconds of it), and that's too bad, as it's certainly the most fascinating thing shot, though for all the wrong reasons.
Bentley had none of Farfrae's charisma, which disappointed me, even though I know that the movie didn't have to copy the book.
Jovovich decently portrayed a Hardyesque "survivor," though I felt that the director might have used her talents a bit better.
The Claim looks nice in places, though the snow-covered pioneer town invites comparisons with Altman's masterpiece and once again falls short.
There are though quite a few flaws.
The climax is hilarious, though.
On the other side of the Tarkovsky spectrum, I was utterly confused by "The Mirror" - which had zero story to tell (though occasionally visually very nice), I was mostly bored to tears by "Andrey Rublev" (nearly 4 hours!
Seems as though the director got stuck watching Bend it Like Beckham too many times as this movie created too many instances of deja vu.
The restless camera and flashy editing techniques which lift "Flies" out of its genre rut are mere indicators of the chaotic splendor to come, though here it's largely wasted on a flimsy narrative stretched almost to breaking point.
You have to see this when you get drunk though, because it will be a whole night full of laughs.
Cohen's thoughtful (though not perfect) screenplay is packed with many tearing satirical comments with a tongue-in-cheek approach, but the direction would've been bettered suited if it didn't come to be so hard pressed in delivering these scenes.
That's pretty much the first half of the story too and it does come across like a political drama, though at times it did feel and look like a TV soapy.
Damn it's particularly spiteful stuff, though not terribly gory, but it had its fair share of bloody moments.
The leading kid is a real doofus and the kid in the wheelchair seems to know so much about what's going on, even though he doesn't appear until later in the story.
I didn't get much fun out of it liked I hoped I would, though I didn't think it was a total mess and it's something a bit different.
Right away, though, I had a slight problem in that nobody anywhere is named Miss Toni Cardell.
As it is though, it is merely good King/Woods entertainment, but that ain't bad in it self.
Id rather watch a real cat sleep then watch this stupid cat wander into another Stephen King short story though, so go figure.
)It seems as though this show was scraped together after Invader Zim was released and when Jimmy Neutron was in production back in 2001.
It really does have very good parts but it is as though the writer/director missed the boat entirely in spending so much time on the build-up and the climax ended far too quickly.
I am writing one now though as I may never find the movie for sale or on television so I may never get that chance.
In the end though I can not remember this movie all that well, it was not gory in the least and was more suspense than anything, but I do not really remember the suspense being all that suspenseful.
In terms of supernatural 80s horror movies this is acceptable enough for undiscerning nostalgists; though purists may balk that the central things-going-bump-in-the-bedroom sequence between Trish and her resident toyboy handyman Gautreux sets the whole picture at odds with the otherwise PG-compliant avoidance of physical horror and narrative suspense.
This was Akki's first film with DD who is known for his mad films, Akki had done a comic role before in SUHAAG(94) but here he plays a full comedian  The movie is a full crap and surprisingly DD released it with another film of his DEEWANA MASTANA which had better actors like Anil and Govinda(at least that time) and that film worked  This film is a complete crap film and makes no sense and it doesn't even keep you entertained, A must for comedies  The comedy scenes are trite while the main plot is itself senseless and the attempts to comedy are foolhardy though the message is a nice one  Direction by DD is bad Music is okay  Akshay seems uncomfortable in the comedy set up as it was his first attempt and he was a bad actor those days He shouts too loud and comes across as a poor man's Govinda Juhi is amazing in her comic role and steals the show Kader repeats his act, Paresh is awful Satish Kaushik annoys Gulshan Grover has an indefinite role
If this was the kind of movie intended to keep viewers away from their TVs, I can't imagine it succeeded in doing so -- even though I understand it was a box office hit in its time.
I honestly can't believe I sat though this laughable exercise in film-making.
The suspense in the movie was good, though.
It proved though what a great combination Errol & Olivia were, and would prove to be many times.
The character development was terrible the direction was all over the place and the acting is probably some of the worst i have ever seen in anything plus add shoddy camera work and you have the likes of wicked lake even though there are some nice nude scenes there just anit nothing here i can recommend this is seriously bad.
It didnt work though.
The best thing though about the original was that the cast had chemistry they took you into this world.
Pretty much every part of it was pointless - though I will admit (grudgingly) that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise.
Even though he won the bet, that crumbled his chances.
This is a real western, with all of the needed ingredients in it but added to that are several Michael Curtiz elements, that make the movie entertaining and even somewhat adventurous, though its obviously not your average normal Errol Flynn/Michael Curtiz swashbuckling type of movie.
This movie also feels totally fresh, even though it features all of the formulaic elements, such as a saloon-fight, cattle-driving, card-playing, a hero who becomes sheriff, scruffy looking villains and stuff like that.
are spectacular and beautiful to look at...the couple's relationship gets to be a drag to watch...one, no nuttier than they other...if he cared about her he would've come up with a shrink or something...i felt, after awhile, the thing was too contrived...i heard one reviewer say Betty Blue is great and Million Dollar Baby was lousy and i wished i hadn't read that dude because he told the ending...at least this is a spoiler...i think Betty Blue is OK but Million Dollar Baby light years more enjoyable and moves along telling lots more in the time alloted...this is a pretty film, a slow film, well acted and put together...the story is contrived too much...a different, but same, Cuckoos Nest...it's a comedy at times cutting itself up i think...some of the characters , at times , 'over acted'...i enjoyed it though.
"Betty Blue" fails to captivate though.
(though I did enjoy the 1980 version).
"Black cat, white cat" was still watchable, though clearly worse than the rest.
I didn't, though it seemed to get worse...
A major problem I had with the movie though was I couldn't tell if the main character was gay or not, which created a lot of distracting dissonance.
Can't blame him for trying something fresh though.
This is one of Wayne's poorest films, even though it's refreshing to see him in a different sort of movie.
There probably was no way to do the multi-leveled story lines justice except maybe in a ten-hour miniseries, but even so, what can account for Mandy Patemkin's daughter never growing older even though he has made three successful films since the start of the movie?
E.L Doctorow hoped that "Ragtime" would be made into a t.v miniseries which is really the only way i could ever see it working, even though the musical version in 1998 did an impressive job of adapting the novel.
Likewise, the story of the immigrant Tateh (a fine performance from Mandy Patinkin) is too briefly seen, even though they do include the episode of him kicking out his unfaithful wife (played by an unknown Fran Drescher), which was eliminated from the Musical.
In some places, the humor dried up, and you would feel as though the movie was trailing on.
They did make the movie bearable though, kept me going to the next bright spot.
One of the bright spots are the cast though.
A good idea, which could have been done much better though.
An extra plus for the DVD menus though, they were better than the movie and better than most other DVD-menus.
Very little effort was put into this movie, though considering how little the makers had to do (Nearly all the footage was cheap stock footage), they must have made a fortune by spending so little money on this.
With so much competition,it is so difficult,but Paul Danan,desperate enough to star in both series,is the nominal winner;so amazingly smug and irritating that even a prostitute he's just paid Â£1,000,000 would think twice about associating with him,but he's closely followed by Abi Titmuss (notorious for her lascivious public image,but curiously reticent here,maybe because of pound signs in her eyes),Alicia Douvall(grubby groupie),Calum Best(tenth-rate playboy and a poor imitation of his late father George,but minus the peerless footballing talent),and Sophie Anderton.Yes,the ex-cokey model blubbed,scowled,sneered and caterwauled all her way out of our hearts,though she may have been the reason why TV bosses concluded that even this awful spectacle went below the lowest common denominator.By the second series,even the "C" word was dropped as the producers were reduced to persuading the stepsons and stepdaughters of actors and footballers to non-entertain us all.As for who won,well who cares?
It does make you think though, about going to bed.
A clichÃ©d piece about the clichÃ© of dying at 27, though really it's not like hundreds, or even dozens, of rock stars died at that age Â it's only 5, really Â Morrison, Hendrix, Cobain, Joplin, Carpenter.
It is so stock that it seems as though it could have been made by computer program, like the 'hitmaker' they purported to have designed in Josie and the Pussycats (which I admit, unashamedly, I kind of liked).
Another example (a large one at that) is that even though one person in the film claims he is haunted by what happened everyday and that he is against the church (due to a lawsuit he's filed about 18 years later), the Church is still a big part of his life.
It was painful to hear this name be spoken time and time again, and though the story was interesting, the script could not have had more cheese ooze out from every single word of it.
Apart from the music, though, the characters were simply... dumb.
We avoided seeing Fievel Goes West for most of its run; we found out it was going to be pulled out, though, and saw the last showing on the last day.
And while Careful looks quite good--though the tinting is at times oversaturated--his insistence on having his cast read the script in an arch deadpan style is simply annoying and frankly an insult to the films to which he is supposedly paying tribute.
Also you always have to be careful about flashbacks piled upon flashbacks, the way this baby kept stacking them up: another movie that revolves around a disappearance, though without a single flashback, and gets it effects a lot more successfully , L"Aventura, in fact there are certain parallels that are fairly striking, even down to the girl friend and boy friend of the gone one winding up in each others arms, though one is a masterpiece, mostly, and this one a mismash.
It comes across to me as though it has been written by someone who loved the book and wished to put as many small references to the book into the film as possible.
Even stand-up comedians don't seem to do as well with this stuff, though somewhat better.
Even though the poker tournament itself is boring, this movie still could have been laugh out loud funny.
Its the only one that ever scared me during and especially after,for...OK weeks.The eye effects have been used in things since but at the time they did freak me out.The child abuse stuff is damaging.The satanic ritual stuff,even though its been the reason it seems that oh so Christian Americans like to believe that true evil in their country exists for the last few centuries and is thus THE stereotypical scapegoat,and even though it's as unbelievable as any other religion,well it is scary anyway.After all it's TV so a level of disbelief must be maintained.I think a major reason it scared me was the concepts,if they were true just feel more fear inducing than an individual who kills with electricity (DPO) or inbreds(Home) or any of the many reincarnation ones.
Dumbledore seeming to only JUST realize that Voldemort used Horcruxes even though he was meant to have already destroyed one... and not only that but I also explicitly heard Dumbledore say: "They could be anything"!!!
(In the event, so honourable that Caine is prepared to shoot Churchill in cold blood, even though he realises that Hitler's regime is evil and the war is lost.)
Even though the music was worse than anything I could think of.
For anyone who makes the mistake of sitting though this movie: I had just decided to become an actor and I knew very little about it.
Most Pulp-Fiction-like ingredients--interlocked stories about four groups of people (not nonlinear, though), two gangsters' insignificant conversation on smoking and coincidence, extreme close-ups of objects--are so light that the audience may feel even irritated.
This is NOT a gay romance, or gay love story (even though there is a kiss and some meaningful / longing looks).
Through the way this film has been set up, and especially in its ending, it is almost as though we are being expected to just accept that a deep romantic love was / had been taking place.
Some decent underwater shots is all it has to offer, though they add a goof with that as when Ugly Haircut admires the sight outside the Nautilus scuttle the ship would crash into the corals as the camera suggest it is floating sideways.
She looks good for her age though.
The cast isn't necessary all bad either - especially Lee de Broux (RoboCop) is nice to see, even though he doesn't have much to work with.
It was hard to completely watch it though.
I found myself having trouble telling them apart(strange, due to how few there are), though that did get easier as the movie goes along(for obvious reasons... a monumentally strong hint would be which genre film it is).
The acting is, even though you wouldnt think it's possible, worse then the script.
Both Paul Robeson and Bing Crosby made hit recordings of it that same year, though the song is pretty much identified with Robeson now.
I have to admit though I am curious as to how the film ended .
Black Hawk Down though is only colourful in its rich choreography, which to me is what doesn't completely destroy the film, but only supports it on it's last legs.
The main issue though was the excessive amount of action that, to me isn't that bad but when it takes over the basis and substance of the story it becomes quite hard to continue watching.
I'd rather not offend Mr Craig, but I must admit that he is the worst casted James Bond ever in the history of the series it's not his fault though because the filmmakers were the ones who chose him.
Sadly that magic has faded, and boring realism and drama has taken the forefront in an attempt to reinvent Bond, though it may have been acceptable if the Bond was right and if the Bond spirit was still in tact.
But though Bond has been synonymous with action for over forty years, the Bond movies have always been about more than that, namely... fun.
Seriously though, they must of shown every model phone they have they even had my K700i (which is probably the worst piece of technology I have ever bought by the way).
The script itself, along with Brad Silberling's direction is the trump card, though.
this movie could not even make a 3 year old laugh though with the big monster dolls in it seemed like a kindergarten movie which of course even children of under 3 would be bored with after no time !
Davis's boyfriend (John Hodiak) is uncomfortable with the attention Davis is giving to Milland, even though there is no romantic angle to it.
It's plot-less (the idiotic IMDb spell checker insists on the hyphen in "plot-less"), endless, and painfully dated -- though it's hard to believe it was remotely funny even in 1972.
A minor quibble is that some of the quiet lines were hard to hear and understand (though it could've been bad audio compression artifacts since I watched it on Netflix instant watch so it was not full DVD quality).
I give Sudden Fury a rating of 2.5 out of 10 for being so irksome for so much of the time, but generously add an extra half point for its gratuitously violent content, the so-crap-it's-funny sex scene between troubled hit-man anti-hero Walker and a coke-addled hooker, several hilarious jungle warfare flashbacks that look as though they were filmed in the local woods (because they were), and a full-body burn stunt that is actually pretty impressive.
Can't really blame the actors though for this is terribly bad written with no logic or interesting dialog at all.
This is a film so ultra low budget and cheap looking it makes Fortress 2 look like Independence Day, with sets and props so unconvincing you feel as though you could better them with items from your own back yard.
Even Death Note veteran Kenji Kawai's score, while certainly not bad, is a far cry from his work on the previous films, though largely because he's mostly forcibly limited to low key background music and the long periods of sluggish silence Nakata so adores.
As mentioned previously, the ending is suitably poignant, though the tears it almost brought to my eyes are due primarily to my love of and familiarity with the character.
Both are set in a similar time period, both feature a lot of over-the-top performances and both have a silly musical style about them (though the music in THE ASSASSINATION BUREAU was a lot more annoying--particularly the singing).
I wonder, though, if this might have been a much more interesting film if it had been done as serious drama instead of kitsch.
Overall, it seems as though this is a film that poses many questions, but offers no answers.
not that horrendous though... some interesting dialogue.
The lines are dire, and the performances are un-engaging, though again, I'm inclined to blame the director.
It seems as though there were no military advisors at all working on this film.
The story, though, is thin and the attention to detail was so poor as to be a distraction.
The film did have its moments though.
If you're looking for a good nappy time film though, The Shunned House is a sure thing.
Ryan Philippe though had his best presentation yet.
Kirk beams down to the planet Gideon and finds himself on an exact duplicate of the Enterprise but doesn't realise this since the 'set up' is so convincing--even though he meets Odona, its lone occupant.
Odona was a wonderful actor--and a good foil for captain Kirk even though their romance has little basis in fact.
That's not the half of it, though.
The camp factor needle hits "HIGH" as soon as we are introduced to Mercedes McCambridge appearing in a warden's uniform, barking orders in a faux-German accent (even though her name is Thelma Diaz) and giving Marie a backhand across the face for using her name instead of her number, "99".
Some have compared this to "Memento," but the story is really closer in spirit to an old TWILIGHT ZONE episode, titled "Shadow Play" and the play "Steambath," with touches of "Mulholland Drive" and "The Sixth Sense" though lacking the emotional wallop or terror of the others.
The cast is really good, though, with the ravishing regular Franco-nymphs Maria Rohm ("The Bloody Judge", "Eugenie") and Rosalba Neri ("Amuck!
4/10...and that's just because the casting director had the sense to put Gerry in this movie, even though they had no idea of how to spell his name!
I hate his show though, it sucks sucks sucks.
I always though Diamond would make it big and it's a shame he didn't.
I must say though the sound effects for when they are fighting are top notch, the sound effects are so crisp and satisfying and ACTUALLY sound like punches not "PHsHHH" slashing noises from FUNImation... also out of the 3 Pioneer movies "Dead Zone, The Worlds Strongest" and "Tree Of Might" this one has the most stupidest lines!
Even though this one was an hour it still did not feel like it, this one isn't even as satisfying as Dead Zone or The Worlds Strongest go watch those instead.
They have a blow-hard boarder, Pat O'Brien, living with them and the boy idolizes and believes in this man--even though practically everything he tells them is pure bull.
Despite all this, the boy remains convinced that O'Brien is his friend--even though at any point O'Brien COULD have gone to the police and told him the truth and had the boy released.
), the amateurish directing (including the clumsy use of slow motion during the clumsy and fatal let's-all-fall-into-the-pool scene--which was hilarious, though I do believe it was meant to be heart-wrenching or somesuch), and just the utter ridiculousness of the thing.
Unfortunately, since "The Ring Two" is rated PG-13, there should be no expectations that she will do any of the stuff she did in "Mulholland Dr.," even though she does tease all the guys in the audience by asking her son if he wants her to get in the tub with him.
Soon though, the undead spirit from the first film reappears to lie claim to Rachel's son through a series of not-entirely-understandable "shock" sequences that lead to a cyclical revelation of horror repeating itself.
I'm sorry, I'm sure you're a nice person though.
Along for the trip is an overly helpful former student, and a bunch of over-fed rednecks with guns, to take pictures only though, of course.
It seems as though the character played by Friedman lost his son to this beast, and he wants revenge.
It seems as though it was shot in high-def and DV and maybe some VHS-C because there is zero consistency in the picture quality even within a given scene.
Not one person looked like they new any martial arts except Gary Daniels, who even though is a pro-fighter never threw a punch the whole movie.
Please, be intoxicated, otherwise you may hurt yourselves though.
this sparked my attention because later in the movie they saw white dragon on a Japanese comic, they were wondering who he was, even though they were informed of him in the first FIVE MINUTES of the movie.
Even though the movie has a story, too stupid for any 1st-grader, it doesn't really follow these.
What's worse is that, though technically a sound actor, Levitt is part of a whole crop of up-and-coming former child actors that seem completely untouched by life (see Josh Hartnett).
They rarely ever do anything to the engine so even though you have car that has a TV in every seat and a stereo system that could cause permanent hearing loss, you are still driving the same old car underneath.
If your thinking of watching this, I would seriously think twice, due to the poor acting, little tips though... when you place a false hand made of silicon or rubber.. make sure that you don't shine a light onto that prop, and for the woman in stockings when you act dead, try not to clasp your hand around the other actors hand and most important of all... ( Don't Blink ) I am not going to spoil it for you guys as thats the type of person I am, so if your going to watch it.. good luck, oh by the way..
As has already been said here, though, "The I Inside" does try to get a bit too clever for its own good, and the very last sequence should simply have been dropped in my opinion.
But, though it's said too much: The execution was just plain bad.
even though the violence was unrealistic (I mean, severing a head with a kitchen knife?
Not quite enough of it to earn the "strong violence/gore" moniker though.
Hey don't take my word for it though.
I've seen a solid handful of the Gemser 'Emmanuelle' films by this point, and I've had this one laying around for years-so I figured I'd finally give it a shot (even though it's an 'Emmanuelle' film in name only).
I gave it an 8, though I think a 7.5 would be more accurate to my opinion at this moment.
And Montgomery looks as though he despises not only the fact that she is a career woman--but a woman he can't possibly think of as a mate.
That aside though, a cute little film with lots of comedy with Davis and Montgomery interacting with the small-town Indiana family whose wedding they have come to cover for a women's magazine.
Impossible though it seems, this actually makes the books look good in comparison.
Heads up, though.
Funnily though, you won't get to know mr Arn at all!
The film looks as though they decided to appeal to the psychological thriller market ( a genre where this sort of stunt is painfully common) so they filmed an extra scene or two and tossed it in to let the audience sort it out.
first of all, the story was not great, though a pregnant godzilla was a nice twist.
Neither of these is enough to carrying this overblown movie though, especially the NYC angle, which is spoiled because it appears they shot this movie during the monsoon season.
Unfortunately, though, it all ends in a somewhat underwhelming finale where the family enter some vortex or something.
The rest of the family is back, though, headed up by stoner parents JoBeth Williams and Coach (a.k.a Craig T. Nelson, who is painfully bad in this), who both have really bad hair.
Even though it has clear stylistic and thematic precursors, The I Inside is a gem of a film that should have had a theatrical release at an earlier date.
To give you an idea of what the film is like, though, it would be sufficient to cite the other works that the I Inside cast and crew have mentioned as influences--The Sixth Sense (1999), The Others (2001), Donnie Darko (2001), Memento (2000), and perhaps most significantly Jacob's Ladder (1990).
Even though its free, its still a waste of 50 minutes of your life, So save your bandwidth and avoid this fanfic.
Darth Vader's voice was really good though.
One of the things overlooked in some of the other comments is that the director did quite a decent job staging shots, especially in staging the crowd scenes, which is unusual in the Fan Film World, though the fight scenes near the end are weak and the pacing was slow.
Don't misunderstand though, that's not a compliment.
2/10 for its quasi-charm (though even that was more annoying than charming after 3 minutes!)
Even though I disliked and heavily bashed a lot of the films he starred in, including this "The Werewolf and the Yeti", I was still a big fan of his work and charismatic appearance and I hope that he'll rest in peace in the hereafter.
Ben Kingsley is good though, and I liked the genuine feel to the surroundings, but that doesnÂ´t help this empty shell of a movie.
I have to say though, one of the biggest letdowns between the terrible CGI, fourth grade acting and sound effects would have to be the guns.
But the worst thing in the movie, its definitely Casper Van Dien, trying to do a though character...but he fail 100%..  Im a Starship Trooper first flick fan, sincerely, this Starship 3: Marauder in my opinion is a bad movie.
So, 1 out of 10, even though it deserves a 0.
Even though I do like the genre, and did like the original, I really disliked this.
All in all, this was a "coming of age" story.In the end, we see the three characters two years later, in the same place in Goa where they spend that last summer of youth together.At this point though,they have come full circle, and have moved on from "boys to men".We feel their maturity come through as they sit their talking,even though non of them say anything profound.
It's as though someone said, let's have an earthquake strike Manhattan because having people trapped in a subway system would be cool.
After that though...it took something of a downward spiral.
I just finished reading Henry James' "The Bostonians," and though I found the book to be a fine read and rather effective in capturing the many waves of emotion that flow through its often unappealing characters, I can't say I was taken much with its mean-spirited and narrow satire.
Given that I found the book to have such objectionable themes, I probably should have stayed away from the film, but since movies have a long history of "free adaptations" of novels, I though that perhaps the film version of "The Bostonians" might give some form and direction to James' sometimes overwritten, anti-feminist jeremiad.
He seems fairly proud of this pic, though, which allows an extremely talented cast to either overplay or underplay to agonizing effect.
Like i said though.
In the main, though, this show's depiction of a man with something the writers inexplicably think is OCD simply makes people who have the real condition feel more ostracized than ever.
The guy who runs the general store sells beer, even though it's in a dry county--but the kids don't know.
But the plot line was so confused (not confusing, but confused, though it was the former as well), the presentation so plain and directionless, that the entire experience left a sour taste in my mouth as I left the theatre.
Blessed are those easily satisfied, though not understanding something (whether by its being truly complicated or merely by atrocious presentation) does not make it deep.
Even though it's a true story, all of the characters were like stereotypes.
He was great at crying though!
Why any film company would choose to publicise the fact that their product is courtesy of the man whose most notable recent achievement was Escape From LA is a bit of a mystery Unlike that though, while a long way short of being a good film, Ghosts is surprisingly fun.
Score is straight out of Quake, and in fact the whole thing has that kind of video game feeling, though at least in a video game you are participating in some small way.
In the end, though, racism is a minor point, since everything else has been mishandled to such a spectacular degree.
What I would like to say though is that based on what the actors had to work with (horrible script, compressed location, undefined enemy etc.
It looks OK though, in being actually there I mean.
The same producers later delivered the "Night Watch" - an evenly questionable, though better shot, piece of film.
This is a dreary TV movie and even though it likes to promote itself as a "Charlie's Angels" deal,it is nowhere near as good as the original series or even the gawdawful, irretrievably stupid, recent C.A.
And though most of the cast was on the wooden side, the lead actor was pretty decent.
To be honest, in the end I rather enjoyed watching most of The Descendant, though I couldn't admire it.
Whether the original film was any good is a matter of conjecture: though John Steiner is excellent as a British doctor, Orson Welles mumbles his way through his performance as a Mexican colonel and Ennio Morricone's score is cribbed from his earlier work.
Oddness, though not immediately apparent, is indeed present.
Most of what Charlie does isn't all that scary (such as having someone turn into an iguana--and not even showing the transformation), though I really loved when he was royally ticked off and overheard people laughing--and made their faces disappear (you see one of these people--a woman grasping about the ship).
but it's a film clearly targeted at Asian early- and pre-teens with the inclusion of super-secretive Japanese rock star "Hyde" in a prominent, though not leading, role.
Worse of all, it is not funny and the songwriting fail to deliver one memorable song (they all sound the same; heck they seem as though they were recycled from other Dick powell hits).
Aamir Khan, though seems to be miscast in the role of the completely cynical womaniser Akash, demonstrates a very fine versatility in this role and successfully shows the gradual growth of his character with depth and humour.
Sonali Kulkarni's real talent is wasted, though she does try to do the best of what she is given.
Even though it looked from the box like this movie was low-budget, with a cast of unknowns, I thought it might have some possibilities as a mystery story.
As a matter of fact, one of the few redeeming qualities was the quality of the body-double (though the transition from actress's face to the body-double was also poorly done).
Preity Zinta plays Shalini - Akash's love interest, though throughout the film Akash claims that he does not believe in love.
It would be unfair to call Aamir Khan the life of the DCH though his popularity in India and abroad would have drawn a substantial part of the film's audience.
The lead character of a car theft, doesn't seem to have much one screen charisma and looks as though he is nearly falling asleep in his deliver of some of his lines.
Even though, to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including Gays in one shows, sucking American reality show.
The second half is filled with emotion though the Aamir-Preity affair has been stretched a lot thus making the film a bit lengthy.
And even though I would never refer to myself as a liberal or a Democrat, I was opposed to the war in Iraq from day one.
Imitation is, apparently the highest form of flattery, but seeing as though this is nothing near Grosse Point Blanc and in the same league as meet the (watch if your a moron) Spartans in terms of political satire, lets leave well enough alone and let this one fade into the obscurity it absolutely deserves.
We can also forgive KickBoxer 4 from switching the tong po character star Michael Qissi, though this movie barely connects to the kickboxer franchise, the only connection is a weak Six degrees of separation to the character of David sloane which is obviously mentioned to justify the title.
When and if I go to New York City, I'm going to stay there, even though I know it's expensive.
What I didn't like though, was the character of Priya who was so utterly selfish that from the moment Krrish followed her to Singapore she did nothing but lie to him.
Krrish is being promoted as Indias first superhero movie even though that genre is probably the oldest in Indian film history.
Plus points:-  1.The graphics:-Pretty good for an Indian movie though flawed in their execution.
One thing I noticed about this cheese wedge was that it tried to look like it was taking place in North America even though it was made in Spain: 1- A portrait of George Washington hangs on the wall in the main setting.
Well anyway, this is a stupid movie, though the MST version is quite funny.
The band doesn't like Laura very much, even though she's pretty much the only fan the band will ever have.
The script was poorly written dialogue though, not as much humor as needed for this film.
Both their faces were mighty dry-looking though, so they didn't completely disturb the movie's track record for anti-continuity.
When the ants are closing in on our heroes, they actually take the same clip and show it to you three times - making the ants seem as though they are marching to the same place three times over.
This "movie" made me laugh even though it wasn't meant to be a comedy (I think).
Even a bad film made back then on this topic, at least it was unintentionally humorous, though sadly it isn't the case with this one.
The parts are most often overacted, though Susan Hayward's performed well overall.
This is one of a series of vintage AIP horror titles released some time ago as part of an R2 DVD collection entitled "The Arkoff Library", though the copy I watched was actually culled from an AMC TV broadcast (with constant streaming advertisements of upcoming shows and pictures!
Thematically, the film is a variation on the classic INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956) with a small town gradually taken over (though not by an alien organism but rather a vanished Â and, typically, superior Â civilization); despite the sensationalistic title, the creatures Â 'possessing' their victims through small punctures at the back of the neck Â are never actually seen, leading to a wonderful POV shot (perhaps the film's highlight) depicting an attack on the hero's girlfriend.
The end result is not too bad though hardly a classic of its familiar kind or genre and obviously cramped by the low budget and necessary compactness (running a mere 56 minutes); interestingly, the film's director is the burly Orson Welles-lookalike sleazeball from DEMENTIA (1955).
It's all faintly ridiculous, and progresses in such a jarring and disjointed way that it feels as though your brains are being scrambled.
It's not that type of movie, though.
The deadliest weak point though, is the accent.
The best part, though, HAD to be the redneck who was doing the Slingblade impression.
Itâs ironic that, of Ganceâs more celebrated Silent work, this should be the one I watch first: itâs a one-reel short about a mad scientist â hence its inclusion in the âHorror Challengeâ, though the tone throughout is distinctly comical!
And, poor Kryten (the original British actor), though good, looked bored with the whole affair.
Three's Company, All in the Family, even Sanford and Son started out as British comedies, though translated well for American audiences.
The graphics were actually worse, though it sounds impossible, than the UK version; this does include the credits.
And yes, you can still identify CG even though the shaders are extremely good and I do not want to know how much post-processing they put over it.
Which is as lousy of a teen horror movie as they come, though I have to admit it does have a couple of interesting things to offer.
Rydell is a stunt performer turned would be leading hunk and now a writer ("The Power Rangers") which is helpful because he got to do all of his own stuntwork, though I am not sure if Allen Garfield was that spry.
A good looking, well acted (the leading players are excellent)but dull and VERY disjointed biopic of the famous prophet that seems of though it was cut down from something much longer.
I kind of like these movies of hot, dusty Texas towns with bank robbers and smugglers and bouncing vehicles though.
Himmesh Reshammia is a great, though a bit annoying, music director and singer.
There was a problem  though: Buzz stood behind Kevin and was holding a candle.
However, it is Pandey that gives a stand out performance even though his role is mediocre and pale in comparison to Benicio Del Toro in "Snatch".
Some though they were copies of Hollywood movies but still worth a watch.
There is some good scenery though.
It gets a little embarrassing though to see how much confidence he places in his own Kentucky Rifle, especially when he offers up a prayer to help him shoot straight.
A bad movie remains a bad movie though, even if you add cancer to it.
I'm giving two stars here, strictly in honor of Penelope Cruz's tits, which we see several times, thankfully -- though they're obviously not photographed by anyone who seems to care.
Along the way he crosses swords with various characters from earlier Pink Panther films, before it is finally revealed to the audience (though not to Clifton Sleigh) what actually became of the hapless Inspector Clouseau.
Even though this is a great film, the originality is lost.
There are a few good things about this sequel, though: I liked seeing Crispin Glover, who is always interesting, and Corey Feldman is pretty cool until the last 20 minutes, where he annoys the hell outta me.
Good gore scenes, though, done by Tom Savini.
even though they lack everything else, but it was still nicely done in animation wise.
Even though I like the story and how it was animated, I just didn't want to sit through it anymore.
More importantly, I think, is the way that the film portrays entire alien races as having a species-specific character, as though they were created with racial personality cookie-cutters; hence, the Hutts are gangsters, while the Gungans are clownish, petty and stupid.
This film is unforgivably bad, what's worse is that nobody can sense the force within Palpatine (even though he is a Sith Lord).
There is little gore or explicit scenes though.
This, though, is not one of them!
The plot though preposterous could have formed the basis of decent movie but one gets the impression that not enough time was put into tightening up the script so that the dialogue regularly lurches into the farcical.
The monster was cool though: At some point the film switches gears, transforming itself from a DA VINCI CODE-esquire thriller about ancient artifacts, manuscripts, talismans and glowering white haired Swedes into a busy, loud and amusingly obnoxious monster movie.
Oh well, I do like Cuba though.
(*SPOILER*)I had trouble believing Russell didn't see through that old-man getup and didn't think the ending was very likely, even though it does seem like a heck of an idea for a conclusion.
He didn't, though.
No one else distinguishes himself or herself, though Marianne Jean-Baptiste carries her weight as a friendly and principled lawyer, and Mark Pellegrino is creepy enough to pass as a professor, never mind a serial killer.
Simply put, though, it's too bad it wasn't better done.
I CANNOT stand Home Alone 3 though.
I don't think I could sit through it a second time though.
Typically though, once they get a hold of him the give away far too much info.
And it goes on: Abe gives up the crown piece to Prince Nuada even though his hostage (the princess) isn't in ANY danger whatsoever; for some reason, Princess Nuala sacrifices herself AND her brother to save the life of Hellboy, who she wouldn't even care about if it weren't for the fact that he's the main protagonist and the audience is supposed to be rooting for him; Selma Blair's character tells Hellboy that she's pregnant to give him a reason to live (this whole scene was about as subtle as a brick.
Curtiz can't do much with this hackneyed scenario, and he's certainly not helped by the unsurprising script, though there is one strong sequence at a piano recital.
Not to mention seeing Bela Lugosi in color (even though the color is gangrenous and blotchy).
I rated it a 4/10, which is probably higher than it deserves, simply for Bela Lugosi's presence and reasonable (though not stellar) performance.
Unfortunately, Bela is underutilized here and seems to disappear for lengthy stretches, though his presence in general will be enough of an incentive for fans to check this out.
This film was told though a series of flashbacks as told by a dead woman lying on a slab at the morgue.
The plot, though far from great, is reasonably interesting and will probably be quite enjoyable to fans of Bela Lugosi--especially the strange twist ending (though it is a tad too complicated).
Others probably will find the whole thing rather silly and dull--though I think this gave the film some of its cheesy charm.
Every character in Scared to Death acts so suspiciously it becomes both irritating & distracting, I mean do these people want to be suspected of murder even though it hasn't even happened yet?!
By attempting to pass themselves off as Hornblower stories, though, they become openly offensive.
Costello was born and raised in northern New Jersey, as was Abbott, and both had the sharp, rapid-fire speech patterns and New York-ish accent typical of that area, though Costello's was more pronounced than Abbott's.
I have to say though, I am stuck in the middle of them all.
Unfortunately though, Suburban Mayhem just doesn't cut it.
What is weird is that while the show has obviously turned in to a train wreck, it is still on even though you can tell no one cares anymore... Their daughter has been replaced twice, even going from a brune girl to a blonde girl between 2 episodes, but if you can't tell that it's a sign even the producers don't care anymore then keep watching by all means!
I never think watching a movie is a waste of time, though this one came close!!
Honestly, though, this show started out bad and just got worse.
I must say though, there were some incredible shots of the backs of people's ears, but other than that, nothing.
This time, though, no beer, volume all the way up and the intention of conquering a task with the eagerness that can come only from being defeated at it beforehand.
Performances from both Williams (who gets to swim) and Jeff Chandler aren't too bad, though the filmmakers have no idea how to end this saga, and the hectic last reel is a squashy mess.
Be warned, though, that Dana Andrews is seriously annoying in this one.
During its inauspicious four year run, the TV series "Starsky & Hutch" was never a huge hit; though it did land at an impressive number 15 in the Nielsen ratings its first year (1975-76), the numbers declined steadily thereafter.
Snoop plays a wonderful character though, he is the only one that works well in this.
Ultimately though, the film does not satisfy because whatever message the film is putting across is too obscure.
Ultimately, her non-expressiveness itself becomes an expression of her character, and though Gwen comes across as more caricature than character, within the context of the material, it works.
Moreover inept, really, though it's not without a certain allotment of watchability (unless it's late at night, which might make it a good movie to fall asleep to, or to fool around with the significant other).
I actually laughed aloud at "Jeffy" when Tom, piloting a fake sea serpent, crushed several boatloads of people, and later (though not the last episode), we get our happiest moment as Tom is finally granted the sweet release of death, and takes half the town with him.
sketch comedy (Robot Chicken again), though I'm still sometimes at a loss as to whether I want to laugh of just smack them.
It was as though the screenwriter/director forced everything to fit what was written, which causes the viewer to go, "Huh?
The ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film, having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so.
"Reefer Madness" falls into the same category, even though the production of it was somewhat better, with an added bonus for the folks involved with the making of it ...It was also meant to be used as a "teaching" tool.
She dumps Trevor, though he's ready to divorce his wife for her, and walks away, teary-eyed.
Here, though, Young is costarred with youthful and handsome Cary Grant.
I didn't understand (or feel as though I gained an understanding of) any of the characters or their motivations.
"That's possible..." is my favourite line (Jackson); though most any of Portman's and any of Christensen's will do.
The supporting cast headed by Macgregor are patchy too though Macgregor is head and shoulders above the two teenage leads and at times manage to act with some gusto.
Lost opportunities is what this film is full of though, inside is a really good story struggling to get out but the issues are dumbed down to make them suitable for children to understand.
The sound though is superb, watching at home on my Dolby 5:1 did make it a bit more of an experience but if you are relying on technical details to carry a film then you really shouldn't be making it to start with.
Of course, at the end it is the gutless wimp who wins the gunfight, though we all know that Henry Fonda could have smoked James Stewart with his eyes closed.
Yeah, OK MW blows its two best fights in the first 20 minutes, but there's a lot of good solid action going on here, and though Yeoh isn't as central as I would have liked to preceedings (given she's the only one here who can act her way out of a paper bag) she has some fantastic set pieces and humorous lines to fight/charm her way through.
This film, though technically good (lots of pretty and well choreographed scenes, beautiful women, and pretty good acting)is disturbing, and some people should probably avoid it.
This inspired my friend and I to watch some Borgnine films, and he suggested this rather obscure yet terrible piece of garbage (though he meant well, and I certainly didn't mind giving it a shot).
"Cleopatra", with Richard Burton, will give you a much better idea of how events unfolded, fanciful though it is.
There's also the painfully comic Maecenas, whom we see as a screeching drag queen, even though there is little historical evidence that he was such (he's once referred to as "being effeminate in his pleasures" in the annals).
The sets are fine, though their CGI backdrops can be a bit jarring at times.
I do like the sound of it much better in Spanish though, as seen in the graphic.
The Wheeler/Lee songs are more cute and enjoyable than the rest, though it should also be noted that Ms. Lee sings almost exactly like Betty Boop!!
Even though the thought of Ben Stiller trying to eat Chris Rock in real life brings me some small chuckles.
I just wish I'd never seen it........... For all of those who really love the book (and know it from childhood like I do) steer clear from this production even though the package might catch your attention.
--even though he looks defeated.
Even though both films are around 30 years old, the combination gives a good idea of the joys and joyous frustrations of living in the city.
Sangster regretfully reverts to all the dreadful genre-clichÃ©s (secrets in the attic, slamming doors, hidden roomsÂ) and he depicts his native country England like one gigantic stereotype where everyone stops their activities to drink tea and where people continue to talk with a sophisticated tone of voice even though they're pure evil.
A beautiful, young, American couple goes to England because of a mysterious business proposition and because the movie takes place there 'cause it's always gloomy and foggy and coldish and this is a supernatural thriller in a big house and finally because most couple in these derivative though sometimes enjoyable outings are a bit on the slow side.
Near the end though there is very little horror to write home about and the crossbow scene just punches that point home that this movie just is not really a horror movie at all
The costumes, the scenery, the colors, they all come together really well, and we can see the hard work in it (I don't understand though, why a story with basically NO wondrous elements should get a so out-of-this-world scenery).
And telling Mr Carrey to get off the screen (even though he can't here me) because his interpretation of Count Olaf was dire.
Generally speaking, though, I have a very negative reaction to this film.
The inexperience is so clear though with practice a couple of the cast could get good but this... Well i don't real know what it is... a cross between the ground shots from Miami vice, the talent of the child between enter Sharai and son of dork and sex like you-porn.com Though the blond girl is quite pretty she should have a career if she took the time to research the other contributers like the director and camera man for a school rec it might pass as appalling but as a film there is a long way to go sorry
Even though he isn't the great love that Johan was, Anna likes being cared for, so they move in together.
It is as though a different director and writer took over.
I could go on for a good while yet, mentioning for example the 'influences' from other films that verge on plagiarism (the madness scene in the asylum looked as though it was lifted straight out of the 1930 'Dracula'), or what indeed that whole scene had to do with anything, but what would be the point?
Thus ensuring that a few Doors fans like myself would give it a try even though we were well aware after his awful LA Woman interpretation that Ray Manzarek had the directing talent of a half drunk chimp on crack.
"Time Out" said that it was as though two adolescents had been let loose with a camera.
I am probably being harsh, but just like all kinds of white rappers showed up after Eminem took the world by storm, so has some other wannabes trying to become the next Tony Jaa, (even though his success here in the states has at the very least been limited) Granted this kid did O.K.
I'm not though, because I have not seen it.
I found myself neither liking nor caring about anyone in the film, though not for lack of trying!
Sean Connery was not a good choice for playing Arthur, they got a Scot playing an English King and even though I'm a Bond fan, Sean Connery is a particularly good actor after that.
But on the night before the marriage she vanished, and he - broken hearted (apparently) - has returned every night ever since as though waiting for her.
It would be funny if it was, though.
The premise sounds pretty good, the execution, though, leaves a lot to be desired.
It seems as though there is a symbiotic relationship, but what is the nature of that symbiosis?
They don't shock too much even though the film tries it very much.
The acting is again non existent and the film was pretty hard to sit through for the second time, even though the film runs only slightly over one hour.
I give credit for the last 20% or so of the movie, though.
Still, though, it's not a good movie.
It is a rare and beautiful thing for the genre, though most of good ones star Steve Reeves.
If I had to describe it, though, I'd say it's a mixture of comedic-reality TV, 80's teen movies (like ferris beullers day off), and clerks.
The main storyline, though contrived at points, kept a consistent mix of cynical humor and sarcastic wit with downright impossibly ridiculous situations and an extremely unlikely cast of characters - including "Bitch," the main character's abusive ex-girlfriend - that had me laughing out loud more than a few times.
This time though you won't regret following them around for a day.
All were solemnly shaking their heads and looking as though they had been to a funeral.
Movie was made, but that movie isn't that good.In the movie "Miami Vice" we've got lots of famous people,like director Michael Mann,actors Colin Ferrell,Jamie Foxx,Naomie Harris and lots more.Producers succeeded to hire big shot stars on this movie so they can replace actors from series.But they couldn't.Script of the movie is not that bad and we all know what Michael Mann is capable to do but it didn't work with this film.First of all this movie is too long.It is so long that I almost fall asleep in the cinema.Second,actors like Collin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are good actors but they cannot pull this one on their back.Collin Farrell is trying to be different from Don Johnson but he just can't do it.Don Johnson is so much better then Farrell in this role.Jamie Foxx played well,although I don't like him as an actor.And also I have to say that these two actors are good choice but why did they made this movie?To bring them money.There are lots of locations but why do they call it "Miami Vice" when the plot is not set in Miami.They could call it "World Vice" instead.I didn't enjoyed in this movie,but maybe my expectations where too big.I like Mann's camera and he really knows his job.The things I didn't liked where some scenes where Ferrell could do a better job and I also don't know why is this movie so long.It gets boring toward the end.Even though this movie has lot of famous people, it hasn't got some thing so I can say that movie is fine.It lacks of magic.
One notable exception, though, is one of the teenagers' grandmother.
Utterly absurd thriller, though original in some ways.
This movie will bore you to tears if you try to watch the whole thing (even though it's relatively short...it's THAT bad).
This tough-talking drama from 20th Century Fox emulates the gritty Warner Bros. 'style' of its day, though it's hard not to be cynical about the script's high-falutin' insistence on the nobility of the press (!).
(I make a special exception for Alien3 [WARNING: SPOILERS of series-spoiling elements in Alien3 & 4 FOLLOW], which, though not bad overall, will forever be my choice for worst movie because of the GLARING PLOT HOLE and contrived, character-killing plot devices at the start of the movie that COMPLETELY DISREGARD the plot, characters, and story lines that Cameron et al.
I have nothing against films being shot on video or digital, even though the sound is often awful.
This movie never gets interesting even though that the beginning try to hook you up.
Unfortunately the script and elaboration are far too messy to make it become a memorable film and I simply can't recommend it wholeheartedly, even though I really wanted to.
I think I was way too confident that I would like "Underworld", even though I wasn't expecting an absolute classic.
I did laugh at a lot of the death scenes though since they were done so poorly.
Just based upon its own merits, though, this film was a crashing bore and waste of my time.
By the end of the movie you do feel as though the kids life has emotionally effected you, you feel for the kid and his family, but that is about it.
i feel as though this film had some potential.
The plot was not terrible overall though it actually showed some potential but it wasn't without flaw.
Overall, though, the cinematography was decently good, which is likely the cause for this film making so much money in the box office.
William Nigh probably relished the chance to direct at a major studio instead of the salt mine of Monogram, but though the film has handsome production values Nigh brings to it all the trademarks of his Monogram work: dullness, no sense of pace and an unwillingness to tell any of the actors they're overacting.
The only somewhat decent thing I can say for this turkey is that it was semi-interesting to see Patric Knowles cast as an insensitive jerk for a change, and the 3 measly minutes we spend in Dr. Rx's laboratory with a chained gorilla is a tad unsettling ... even though I can't for the life of me see how it fits into the rest of this picture!
It was pretty bad, though I admit I watched it to the end.
Even though it was obvious in the original film that the female scientist could have been a lesbian IT WAS IMMATERIAL TO THE PLOT, so wasn't explored!
And it's done to death in this remake, even though, in the original Andromeda Strain, it was done just right.
Only reason I sat though it was because my sister and brother-in-law chose to watch it.
So even though I feel that it is an important topic, it could have been covered in a better way, or at least it should have had a Long message in the end.
Also i feel as though the show cared more about the ratings and the number of viewers then they cared about the viewers that this would upset.
He does a good job in this movie, which just ends out being dull and long (though it isn't that long!).
This movie definitely is both of those things...though the plot is a little hard to follow at times.
Both directors do make significant contributions to "Laundry" film-making though Â which means that their focus on realism gives these hacks a free pass to make movies that are completely devoid of content or insight.
Even though the girl doesn't have time to cry and whine, the theme music does it for her.
I can say that the ending and Talbot's scheme to get the bad guys to surrender was pretty clever, though.
It does have an interesting story I'll admit though the ending is just plain pathetic as is Kirika who is supposed to be some rip off of Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis who's lost her memory.
This anime is a good watch for anyone really though.
So good in fact, that they decide to market it as a new kind of ice cream treat, even though it's "not" ice cream.
After this came the Christmas calendar of which the very logic and basic concept is deeply flawed and contradicts the series(disrespecting its very roots, though not in the least as much as this does), and the movie following the idea of aforementioned calendar, which I continually refuse to watch.
If they had a written a decent story and stuck to the whole caper aspect of the movie, this might've been a pretty decent (though likely still obscure) story.
One or two laughs though.
Other then that though, the movie is hideous and hideously dull.
I did get a laugh at the hotel/bomb/water scene though... no spoiler there :)  Anyway, that's my opinion, take it or leave it.
Sly Stallone mumbles so badly that only about 5% of his dialogue is intelligible (though this is probably a plus, given the quality of the writing).Sharon Stone is nice to look at but her acting starts off bad and gets worse in a hurry.
The total 70s feel is a major plus though.
Paige Turco returns for a second run as April O'Neil, though she seems to be hamming it up a bit more this time and comes off as irritating more often than not.
Raphael becomes good friends with Yoshi and teaches him to watch his temper, though he should be taking his own advice.
However, we don't have Jim Henson Creature Shop providing the costumes... as a result, the turtles look more... ugly in this film (their eyes and mouth operate better, though).
I will never know what persuaded Elias Koteas to return as Casey Jones (and, in fact, as a glutton for punishment he takes on TWO roles this time around though neither of them get that much screen time) but he's a small ember of enjoyment in a rather stinky quagmire of a movie.
I will give it credit for having suspense, though it was the half-hearted, stressful kind of suspense you get when you are in denial about the fact that you are sitting through a numbingly pathetic excuse for a movie and you are clinging to a futile hope that in a couple of minutes it might get interesting.
Even though it was a bit corny, he quickly ran through all of the lines the Tall Man said in the "Phantasm" films, and since most of his dialogue in these movies is so memorable it was great to hear him say them in character.
It was filmed by Nassour Studios, though the team was still under contract to Universal.
Abbott does the familiar bit where he thinks Lou has been killed and delivers a long, mournful monologue about what a great guy Lou was and how he, Abbott, is to blame... even though Lou's standing right there.
They see things that they can relate to in their personal lives, and that endears the characters to them, even though the characters are merely personality templates.
28 years later, Don Coscarelli is now seen as a master of horror and Angus Scrimm somewhat of a horror icon (though to a lesser degree than, say, Robert Englund).
The breasts are nice, even though some of them aren't that real, but they usually come in pairs, which is good.
-When they are filling up with gas, i find it very curious that even though they know not to go anywhere alone, Jim decides to go wandering into a dark shack by himself for absolutely no reason.
That doesn't mean they had enough talent to make one though!
The script is solid and the characters are believable (there are some real-life situations thrown in as well, so there is some sort of viewer-character connections that can be made), even though about ninety-nine percent of this film is something of pure fantasy.
Seriously though they do belong in a circus.
Generally, though, none of the actors do well, with even the usually hilarious Kenneth Williams struggling with the feeble script.
Post-Behind, England was a laugh vacuum, though the rumours of Emmannuelle being pornographic are, of course, a myth.
That's about it for me though.
the characters are dull and even though it may be trying to create a retro feeling, it is out dated and no longer pleasant to the tastes of viewers.
I think that this series tells you that it is alright for men to beat up their wives which may lead to the wives beating their children, or they could be forced to admit they do by their animal husbands, but the wives should still be punished, even though they're being led to believe this is the way to treat people.
Billy Grey is not, though possibly he was at the time.
The fact is, though, the boy at the center of this is very troubled, constantly near the brink of hysterics.
I will say that the plot, though well worn, is a good one and ripe for exploitation.
Even though you generally know what's going to happen, the craftmanship with which the characters are portrayed makes it certain that your joy is never diminished.
This movie is very strange though, because this would never happen.
I did always like the movie box when i was a child though, because you could switch it from the picture of the little boy to the fake cupboard door, and i got a key with it.
Even though I rated this plucky movie a 4, it doesn't mean I hate it, my dear friends.
The music was just moderate and odd, though with one exception you'll know when you hear it.
But if you want to watch it, go on and watch it, I am not going to stop you from doing it, though I did not like this movie.
Anyway, he has assumed the identity of a nightclub owner (though he more resembles a stripper...nice body) and has a gay roommate who is fighting with his boyfriend.
BRIAN DENNEHY at least gets a big hand, and JOHN HURT is reminded that two heads are better than one, even though the other one is very small and seems to have originally belonged to KLAUS KINSKI.
I guessed the dead bits (it wasn't hard) and I liked the idea of the sheriff being supportive (young though.
Oh, did I mentioned that much of the acting (though not all) was completely laughable?
It's a pretty entertaining movie for the most part, although by the end I found myself not really caring what happened to the characters (though that could have been sleep calling to me).
All of the characters were insane in their own way, though Pilot is a definite standout as the weirdest.
Various central-casting western types cycle through, brandishing their mustaches and petticoats, and seem to have been left to their own devices on such matters as line readings (Keenan Wynn, in particular, barks his dialog as though dictating it to a sign painter).
Script felicities are many and varied, though none is more rewarding than the scene where Fonda is told that the mine -- upon whose fortunes the town depends -- has just closed, after which he immediately begs his adopted son to settle down in this selfsame place of doom and earn himself an education instead of playing around with guns.
When it's not being burned down, the town -- a tent and two wood-frame buildings whose Nouvelle Vague minimalism is echoed by a cemetery with just one grave -- is regularly assailed by Janice Rule's hilarious Irish accent, though she certainly gets her just desserts (as indeed, do nearly all the cast, shot down either accidentally or deliberately in a climax so stupefyingly barmy that you wonder if Russ Meyer assumed the direction after Kennedy took an errant slug.)
Nearly everything else is "eh" though there's also some entertaining xylophone playing by another comic foil named Fred Sanborn and a little kid named Billy Barty amusingly attempts to pop a balloon as he keeps somersaulting.
When it boils down to it though, The 13th Floor is just far too boring.
And even though it's too late for ONJ and Kelly, it would be great to see Hollywood remake this film as the frantic screwball comedy it should have been.
Case in point: the fact that Olivia Newton John rarely sings on screen, even though this is a musical and we hear songs sung by Olivia and yet Olivia is probably seen performing her songs just a couple of times on screen.
A weird Italian-American ripoff of the horror/sci-fi cycle of the '70s (from "Omen" to "Close Encounters"), this movie looks as though it was made by a hallucinating crew that tossed the old script and started with a new one every day.
The best of girl dancers was Nikki, though she did not have to dance a lot.
(though i suppose that the audience that the author was trying to affect would only have a 2 minute attention span anyhow)  julia stiles disappointed me in this role.
in the hospital the black kids look at Sarah as though they've never seen a white person.
After the first seqel though, is where things began to change...  At the end of the 2nd movie, "COMING SOON SUPERMAN III!"
The new November DVD Should be great though!
Even though both men had been fired from SUPERMAN II after filming 80% of the picture and replaced by Richard Lester and the Newmans (who rewrote and reshot much of the final film, and are the "masterminds" behind III), enough of Donner and Mankiewicz's influence was stamped into the film to keep it from being totally screwed up.
The film does have some positives though, the special effects/gore is above par and done very well, and it's fun to watch the cute "Eiko" prance around, I'd like to see her in more films, hopefully in a more serious role though next time.
I sat through this film even though around the 20 minute mark I wanted it to be over.
I was looking forward to seeing a Palestinian film to see what a Palestinian director would have to say...Not necessarily about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (though that would be interesting too...) but about SOMETHING, damn it!
Suspicious (in a sort of stupid manner), Jackie has a friend start researching both the elderly couples and the previous tenants, which, naturally, leads to grim results which I won't reveal (though they are fairly predictable).
I do expect a certain degree of logic like I would from any other movie, though.
Check out A*P*E*, though, and you won't be disappointed.
After watching "High Voltage" though, I was left with a bad taste in my mouth.
The later TV adaptations, coming into being alongside Christopher Awdry's extension of the book series, wandered somewhat further afield from the feel of the originals, but were still recognisably on-model even though I am aware that Wilbert became somewhat frosty towards Britt Allcroft for deviating from his vision.
It was as though they thought they were acting in a comedy, but the movie was more a serious one than a comedy.
It actually looked as though they just replayed Jabez' first scene over and called it the end.
It seems as though the movie had the scenes made individually, then cut them up and pasted them almost in random order.
Most lines are predictable, and the story is absolutely worthless, not to mention that the constant narration that retells what we just saw makes the entire movie feel as though it's a prologue to a movie we really don't want to see.
The dialogue is absolutely horrible, there is no plot, and even though there are some decent actors, Freddie Prinze Jr ruins it by coming off as a big dope.
Julia Stiles (though I loathe her), Freddie Prinze Jr, Henry Winkler, Selma Blair - even Ashton Kutcher, unrecognisable until halfway through (too long to be watching, I might add!!)
What counts, in the end though, is that the kids enjoyed it.
Even though years before I was terrified!!!!
Focusing on the toys more may not be a wise idea, though, because with one or two exceptions, John Buechler's creations are little more than well-crafted hand puppets.
The cast was alright, even though the acting was more or less worthless.
2 Things I liked though: The setting off the movie in Serbia.
What was with the car on the front cover of the DVD though?
he actually looks really bored and seems as though he would prefer a quiet night in with a video instead of attempting to kick arse), and his physical fitness really needs to be questioned.
Even though Steven Seagal has made movies who are much worse than this, this is still far from being his best work.
Even though they're rather cool, they're as far from the typical Seagal fighting style that it's possible to be.
I told my friend to put Pariah in a new category of "C" films after suffering though it.
It looks as though the whole thing has been thrown together in the space of a couple of days by a bunch of film students to cash in on the success of American History X.  
The mock fifties b-movie entitled "Murder At Midnight", which features the excellent British character actor Nigel Stock is a great laugh though.
This movie's pretty good for laughs, though.
Again, though, it's paced very slowly.
The movie gives a feeling as though it were done to show off a few gross-out special effects, and not much more, but the special effects didn't come out that good and they didn't have enough money to re-shoot.
What they were able to do with that little amount is impression, though, I will admit.
But, Slade wasn't Robin's father, even though the series made slight hints at that.
One day while I was browsing though the videos at a store in the mall I came across a film entitled 'Return of the Boogey Man.'
The photography is OK, though.
Not that I would advise you to buy it, though.
If you're supposedly making a "horror" movie, learn about what is scary, not simply "ooh, it's zombies, and even though it's been done now a thousand times, people will think ours are great!"
Everyone is scared of Daltons and people which was filming this probably though that scary faces of others and some nonsense words from some of Daltons would make me laugh.
One of the films main problems is the talkative dialogue; even though it's French, there are so many useless scenes of non stop talking, that you can go to sleep, wake up, and you would have missed nothing.
But worse, our heroes just walk calmly through this barrage of automatic firepower as though they know that they cannot be hit even if it were a Sherman tank aimed right at their heads from 20 feet away.
I can accept the fact that this librarian will take him in, treat his wounds, and put herself in extreme amounts of danger even though he is a complete stranger and, probably, is the last person you should trust, all because he saved her life.
Almost as if he assumed that we wouldn't see El Mariachi, even though Columbia, according to Robert Rodriguez' diaries in Rebel Without a Crew, said they'd package both movies together when they were negotiating for the rights.
Being a horror fan, that's pretty much how I found it to be though I would not actively seek out the video to add to my collection especially if paying money is involved.
you never get to see most of them very well though.
I will admit though that the production design is quite nice, set during the present but set in a hose full of antiques & period furniture Legend of the Mummy does look like a 20 or 30's period piece in keeping with the traditional Mummy films.
Tales from the Darkside: Ring Around the Redhead starts as convicted murderer Billy Malone (John Heard) is about to be led to the electric chair, before he is though a journalist named Adele (Caris Corfman) is allowed to interview him.
After the first half of the movie, though, the characters that you are introduced to and all the previous plot twists become completely insignificant.
in fact,it's your typical action/crime drama.the characters are stereotypical for this genre.i also found the movie slow and depressing.i was quite disappointed.i was expecting a much better movie than this.the action is slow,and there really isn't much originality here.Andrew Davis directed this one.he also directed The Fugitive,Under Siege and Above the Law,all after Code of Silence.but it's not all bad.for one thing Henry Silva is great as one of the main bad guys,although he doesn't get a lot of screen time.because of it's depressing atmosphere though and how slow it is i give Code of Silence a 4/10
At least both Southern and Hunter attempt an acting performance, though defeated by Doris' trademark out of sync dubbing (with constant cutaways to inanimate objects andÂpeople's shoes ?!
As terrible as this is though, it's one of the main reasons to see this.
The concept of the film is ridiculous, it perhaps could've worked if it didn't take itself so seriously (ironically, it wouldn't have been as funny though).
I later sold it though, it just had no place on my shelf.
Even though it was funny beyond words it is still a very very bad movie, everything in it, there is now faint sign of hope for any of those people who participated in it.
I don't blame him, though, since the script is so godawful.
NAturally,the two clean lads will find love instead of instant sex(though they'll find THAT too;remember,this IS the '80s)in the arms of hot-yet-sympathetic lasses played by Corinne Wahl and JAyne Modean.
I will say this, the acting was quite good and I liked all the performances even though Stapleton bore an uncanny resemblance to Jack Nicholson (probably intended) but this was one of those movies I was waiting to end so I could put something else in.
It is pathetic to listen to these people discuss their effort as though they had created something worthwhile.
Shaolin Soccer isn't too bad though.
You see the cyphers are terribly underwritten so I`ll be kind when I say the actors do their best with non existent material though by a cruel irony we see Jack Palance ( An actor at his very best when saying nothing ) getting far too much in the way of ludicurous lines   There is one aspect to the film that does deserve serious criticism and that`s the editing .
I seriously recommend this movie purely because you will laugh/cringe so much, even though you most likely won't last all the way through.
To me it has the potential of a good plot and even though there wasn't a big name cast, I really thought it would be okay.
One other problem I had, and I'm probably in the minority, but though I speak English, I find myself using the English subtitles more with such thick English accents.
But, hey, it had some good music though.
Diane Keaton is the spinsterish one (though she's too young for the part), Jessica Lange is the sultry one (though she's too old for the part), and Sissy Spacek is the troubled one (though she's too sane for the part).
I though I would never say this, but I'd rather watch a Uwe Boll movies instead of this.
HALLOWEEN 4 director Dwight H. Little gives the most insight into the making of the film though he doesn't seem to passionate about his work.
Even though, to add up the ratings the producers came up with the ideas of including Gays in one shows, sucking American reality show.
Even though they're often forced to say stupid things (Out of nowhere Jackson has an overly expositional insult about Jones's alcoholism, a problem that hadn't been mentioned previously and was never relevant afterwards), these actors are always reliable.
For Jones in particular, the about-to-retire bit is inadvertently cruel: in the preliminary 1968 flashback shot he already looks as though he was born with the century, his noble visage defeating all of Friedkin's technical wizardry -- i.e., getting the actor to wear an oversize hat to cover most of his face -- to assert otherwise.
steals a video tape that wouldn't have excused Jackson's behaviour anyway, even though the film plainly thinks so.
Someone, somewhere though, evidently thought audiences would be engaged by this dross and leave their brains behind: an excruciatingly awful end credit sequence actually has the temerity to chronicle the post-film fate of the movie's characters -- National Security adviser arrested, Ambassador arrested, military hero acquitted of all charges --as if for one moment anyone could ever believe them to approximate to real people.
Be warned though, that first scene really isn't very good.
It's certainly one of John Garfield's best roles, finally getting into the ring: the play Golden Boy had been written for him only for the producers to cast him in a supporting role instead, so there's an element of unfinished business here, though Abraham Polonsky's script is much better that Odets' rather patronising fairytale.
Despite the odd line like "If you wanna fight, fight for something, not for money," it's not an overtly political film, though that didn't stop it being used as evidence of communist subversion in the McCarthy era: few films can have had so many of its cast and crew blacklisted.
Nice cast, though.
This is one of those films that tries to take place in that upper crust world of the middle class where surrealism is abundant in everyone's life and it's as though every mundane occurrence in their daily lives is like something in a movie but they just weren't pulling it off.
It's as though the lead actor wrote it and his writing is even worse than his performance.
Cecilia Cheung also lit up the screen, but not for her acting nor the character's development though.
Shahrukh Khan was giving him an advantage in many scenes, but Salman Khan didn't try (though nobody can blame him).
The film was started post HAHK(even the title was HUM AAPKE HAI SANAM that time) and it took 8 years to complete  When the promo was shown i was shocked considering SRK and Salman haven't shared screenspace since KARAN ARJUN and suddenly a film with them and Madz comes   The movie is regressive, outdated and could be better in 90's  The back story of Madz- Salman is so cringeworthy even there is too much sermonising  But there is one plus point and that is SRK in this film, well normally he overdoes his scenes here he is in full control and plays his role with a straight face and brings a lot of fun in the movie  Sadly the film never manages to sustain the tempo and we have tripe like GALE MEIN LAAL TIE.etc  Also it's funny to see the appearances of actors Salman suddenly in 1 scene looks straight out of JUDWAA days with his medium sized hair and with his overacting but lively acting and then he comes to 2001 days where he looks dead The dubbing too is inconsistent and also his acting which goes from amateurish and then to dead acting SRK too suddenly has short hair, long hair and also his looks keep changing and so his dubbing and acting Madz too, in 1 scene she has brown hair and then the ponytailed black hair look  The film also has the late Laxmikant Berde who wasn't much seen in 2002 Also we see Atul Agnihotri who was rejected post 1998 i feel and was just seen as an extra   Direction by KS Abdiyamaan is outdated though good in parts Music is okay, most songs sound old Cinematography is inconsistent  Acting SRK though looks inconsistent yet he delivers a wonderful performance and rarely hams which is a relief Madz is as usual, she does a good job but her role is too regressive Salman khan is inconsistent, at times lively and at times dead below average overall Laxmikant Berde is okay Alok Nath is okay in a small role Atul Agnihotri is a reject and he annoys
Well, when they arrive, they find the place is infested with zombies (though because the budget was so low, you only see one--late in the film they inform you that the place is infested with them).
into a city of zombies, though some might argue that's already happened.
This picture definitely belongs on a top ten list or top one hundred list even though you never see it on any list.
Even though it is an indie film it is very below the standards of anything I've ever seen before.
It seemed as though they were reading from cue cards the entire time.
I was sorely disappointed though in the production values and the performance of the terrible Sharon Stone.
This is a movie that I think will do better on video than it will in theaters, though I'd encourage people to go see it.
Montgomery's attempt at tough guy speech is ludicrous; it's as though he is trying to emulate Humphrey Bogart while at the same time avoiding a comparison.
The Christmas carols though were a nice touch and Lloyd Nolan who should have played the lead was good as usual in his role as the crooked cop.
Fredric March, though perhaps better known for his dramatic roles, can also handle comedy quite well (e.g., he was fabulous in "Nothing Sacred", and even in the dreadful comedy "Susan and God" he was one of the few who made the film bearable).
I don't know if the failure of this film is due to bad direction, or to the real-life animosity between March and Veronica Lake (though I do think Lake did a good job of hiding her dislike of March when the cameras were rolling), or what.
And her chasing Gravey down the street begging him to take her back after he reveals he has some title was just plain ridiculous(though I guess they had to make something up to set up the final scene).
What annoyed me the most though, was the choppiness of the film.
Interestingly, even though most of the people hated Anne for what had happened to Katherine, Henry's actions made the people sympathetic to Anne as they did not believe her guilty of what she was accused.
Portman does an acceptable job portraying the character from the bookÂeven though this character is not the true Anne Boleyn.
John Ritter was funny in that though.
The film is not particularly gory though.
Tom Cruise, though not terribly bad in his portrayal of Lt. Pete "Maverick" Mitchell, was still largely amateurish.
Fans of the band probably won't care, though, as they seem willing to venture however far off the beaten path Wayne and the boys want to go.
Some of if, though, is very much of its time.
The kids I saw it with seemed to enjoy it though.
It's not funny (even though it's supposed to be a spy spoof), it has little story, and the "romance" the movie hinges on, is contrived nonsense.
The only one who seems to think clearly is the headmistress, who suffers a sudden lapse of judgement toward the ending, though it should be noted that by this point in the film the filmmaking and scriptwriting have devolved to the point of total nonsense.
Then there are movies that are so bad, it is as though Satan himself took a dump inside your DVD player.
because guys don't look nearly as good in the mandatory "Catholic schoolgirl" uniform) can lie, though it isn't exactly clear how a seemingly innocent test question can determine how well a person can lie.
(I will give it this much though; At least it's not a film directed by Uwe Boll.
For some reason though, I didn't plug my iPod back in and do something more meaningful, like stare blankly out my window and try to make animals out of the clouds in the sky on my way to New Hampshire.
Really though, I might be making this film sound like just about every contrived uninventive uninspiring star vehicle excuse of a romantic comedy that you've ever seen, but it's got more!
Honestly, though, you might find it passable entertainment if you're bored and locked in solitary confinement and the only other thing you can look at is a disturbing polaroid photo one One-Toothed Bill.
If someone like me with no scriptwriting talent was writing this movie, and I wanted to show that even though the leading man looks like a bit of a playboy, he has the potential to be a committed and caring husband and father, I might think of having him mentor a cute kid and taking him to baseball games and stuff, and that would have comic potential because when the character needed to be told certain things, I could have the kid saying it and it would be precocious and funny and cute.
All of the actors seem as though they would rather be somewhere else.
What did I expect though, going to see a film with those two hams in the starring roles, they actually make Courteney Cox look funny.
In my defence though, one night a week I do Support Work and my disabled employer wanted to go to the cinema.
Because the 2 anchors swear like sailors as though this were funny, and are very self aware of how cute they are being, which sucks you right out of the humor.
Now if they had been established as an alternate news channel MAYBE I could buy it, but even so, it's not so much the credibility as the fact the actors seem to giggle as though they think everything they say is hilarious.
Giving them a half decent script would have probably helped a lot though.
The British agents put on the Germans uniforms that are, miraculously, perfect fits for Owens Falken & Hall even though the three are different in hight weight pants and suite size.
It shows up that a lot of American chicks are shallow, as they still go for the dropkicks, even though most of them have slept with heaps of women.
I was expecting something great out of it though the actors in the film were not names which with I was familiar.
The plot trudges along through double-crosses and betrayals involving various police officers, mobsters, and the obligatory love interest (Kathryn Harrold, given little do since, even though his wife is awful to him and he's technically dead, he's still a dutiful married man).
Irvin's direction is flat and unenergetic, and even Arnold can't enliven the dreary proceedings (though he tries).
Both of whom are in their early fifties and love lorn, even though they won't admit it.
Sadly though, the whole film is pretty much like watching someone play a computer game - a nerdy kid who for a semester has spent all his lunch money on the latest arcade and now wants to impress his peers (and the girls) showing them he can beat it.
Jill Clayburgh masterfully plays another savvy, divorced woman attempting to date again, and though some viewers may say she has mined this territory before, Clayburgh absolutely nails the love/hate relationship fifty-somethings have with getting back into the swing of things (sometimes it's much more enticing to just sit home and mope).
PF, though, had interesting sub-plots that loosely wove together to make a good movie.
His films have enamoured critics for 10 years now and this one is no different even though it is a shadow of the opulence that we are used to from him.
Thankfully though, it is quite silly at times with some corny dialogue and overacting by Douglas, not to mention some awful dubbing over Keitel's voice.
Still, having come back to it after so long, I was expecting to be greatly disappointed but actually I enjoyed it for what it is: as a sci-fi epic, it certainly brought nothing new to the table (borrowing the plot's essential life-on-a-space-station element from SILENT RUNNING [1971] and its sex-starved robot, an appropriately menacing creation, from DEMON SEED [1977]) but was nonetheless fairly engaging - with a stylish enough look courtesy of cinematographer Billy Williams and production designer Stuart Craig (though Elmer Bernstein's score is curiously forgettable) - and, thankfully, did not overstay its welcome (running for only 88 minutes).
- weren't exactly inspired (Douglas, by this time, was past his prime and, unfortunately, his stint in the sci-fi/horror genre - which also comprised HOLOCAUST 2000 [1977; the only one I've yet to catch up with, though it's been shown on Italian TV quite a few times], THE FURY [1978] and THE FINAL COUNTDOWN [1980] - is best forgotten!)
but, at least, Harvey Keitel brought to it his typical intensity and intelligence - though I'm sure it's a film he'd rather forget.
I can quite often enjoy a movie even though I know it's pretty bad, because there is usually something there worth enjoying.
In the end, though, "women do more of everything," as Christopher's buddy says, and our hero confesses to Grace that "you were right about everything," so we are back to women-centric starting place.
Not that it saves this film though, it's a great idea which, contrary to popular belief, didn't rip-off Diary of the Dead as it was made before it.
The film is boring though, to be perfectly honest and the good effects don't save it at all.
Nothing really good to say about this crap-fest....the acting as horrible,the script was lame,even if it was ad-libbed it was still bad stuff.Special effects non-existent,they mainly consisted of newspapers blowing around in the streets.The zombies were those half-ass done kind with just some pale makeup smeared and there and some blood dashed on here and there.Long camera shots of a dead spider on a counter and rain splashing in a puddle were also counted as special effects I assume.Apparently the special effects budget was shot in the opening scenes where a handful of soldiers wearing gear that looked like it was from WWII ran around for a few minutes taking cover behind objects as they moved toward some buildings as though they expected the zombies to shoot at them!
No hordes of zombies here,just a few here and there milling around,usually standing in a group waiting for their cue to fall when someone shoots a gun their way.Then the camera holder walks up and shows us the zombie laying there with a splatter pattern of brains and blood fanned out from the head all over the ground looking as though the zombie was shot up through the head from under the chin while laying there.Bleeck!At least get the basic physics right!
The way rednecks quickly turn zombie-hunting into a cheerful sporting exercise in "Dawn Of The Dead" (1976) has far more realism, even though that movie was a bit of a comedy, too.
Also, though agonizingly slow, these zombies seem to have no problem sneaking up on adrenaline-pumped humans in wide open grazing fields.
When I saw it in the store I grabbed it and payed $14 (even though i usually buy used films much cheaper) for it seeing that I was already interested in the film and it was attractively packaged.
The film lacks the cheese of Bloodsport, though Mirko lacks none of the credibility that Van Damme does.
Alas, Menzies was never a good director, though his films are often interesting to look at.
The Whip Hand, though, is just awful; dreadful script, poor acting, no pace; and it doesn't even have the Menzies 'look'.
Even though it received 5 stars from many critics, this is the worst movie I have ever seen, including a number of porn movies.
Claude Rains, Fay Bainter, and Donald Crisp were capable of saving just about any film, but even though they ganged up on this one, it was hopeless, not least because the movie's arteries are again clogged with the frothy Lane sisters and three feeble counterparts (Dick Foran, Frank McHugh, Jeffrey Lynn).
The only fun pair-up, though, is hardly a nuptial, and hardly admirable in the real world: Bad Boys Rains and Garfield wind up together at the train station, setting off as con men teamed up to rip off the world.
And even though they've added new scenes that change the storyline slightly here and there, the scenes that they cut out would not have conflicted with the "new" material at all!
Hurray for new scenes that add more depth to my experience of this version of A Little Princess (though I would have preferred them as bonus features).
There was lots of artful focusing and un-focusing which just appeared as though the cameraman didn't know what he was doing.
I will have to add, though, that you don't see much of the creature until half way through the movie.
When a Detective talks to the Surgeon I though the movie switched to slow motion or someone dropped downers in my drink.
Even though Lombardi is on the scene of every one of the She Creature's killings he's totally innocent, to the disgust of police Let.
Also spending the movie in a trance is Lance Fuller, though he's supposed to be fully conscious.
Go check yourself, though, because I've seen the last of this one.
Chantal Janzen's character is for some odd reason extremely underused, even though her character plays an important role in the story.
You can have worse times though...  Ruud van Hemert brought his dynamic duo from his previous flop, 'Ik Ook Van Jou' back into this one, and I must say that Van Erven Dorens is likable in his role, although one can tell it's not acting which he does for a living.
She was extremely intelligent,haughtily aware of her superiority though she never behaved in a condescending manner which would manifest her superior status -rather,she assumed it as a responsibility.She was ever judgemental of her own actions lest they should hurt another's feelings.A proud little soul, during her tribulations we repeatedly read in the pages of the book how her determined mind curbs a fit of pique, or accommodates her bodily wants and her emotional grievances through fanciful imaginings of better possibilities, so that destitute as she is she still gives freely from her heart , even if all she has to give are dreams and reveries, as we see in the successive visits she receives from Lottie and Ermengarde in her garret.It is the least a princess can do.
(Although the substance really wasn't that substantial, though I did like that film.)
Nothing basically wrong with the acting, nothing very wrong with the photography (the colors have aged badly, though), the sets, or the wardrobe, but it is far more dated in every way than any other film I can think of.
This film, though, has less laughs than Polanski's Macbeth.
I liked the coelocanth, though.
And linking this primitive fish to the appearance of avatars was imaginative, though I don't know what gamma rays could have had to do with it.
Theron shows promise though she has to create her performance as she is given nothing by the material.
Generally thought to be the first official Laurel and Hardy release(although PUTTING PANTS ON PHILLIP is also put in this bracket),the boys don't wear their Bowler hats and have their heads shaved,but are very much a team in this early effort,more so than PPOP where they play against each other rather than for.There's plenty of amusing incident and situations(especially when they attempt to escape the jail as painters);one slight quibble is that as convicts,the characters they have to play here have a very slightly more unpleasing edge than they would be establishing only a few films later in the partnership.Still funny though,and Jimmy Finlayson's double take and fade away is worth a few more laughs as well here;in early publicity material the boys were sometimes billed as 'Hardy and Laurel' in this film;that soon changed.
Lately, though, my attention has been turned toward an Illinois band- Linkin Park.
Even though he has it all, he risks losing everything by starting up a steamy side affair with Janet (Jordan Ladd).
The acting is decent, though nothing special.
Schlock thriller with terrible cinematography and a draggy pace does boast some talented names in the credits (co-producer Irwin Yablans had a hand in the original "Halloween"), but the drawing card is of course Linda Blair, and she's attractive and professional as always (though looking a bit sheepish with this third-rate material).
It's a suspiciously mild drive-in quickie, not really deserving of its R-rating, though the big finale is well-staged.
It wasn't just because it was EXTREMELY violent (though it was needlessly graphic) but because I just didn't care about the characters and the script lacked finesse.
This is probably the scriptwriter's fault rather than the actors, though, as the the pace of the plot really didn't allow for the characterisations to be expanded upon.
The 10 year boy in me though "hey that's a cool idea", but the adult film-lover in me thought "man that was a waste of 88 minutes".
All acted, nothing real, though the scenarios feel real enough.
When I saw the DVD standing in the store, I though,finally a movie about WWI, with Danile Craigh and it will be showing us the story of the first big push during the first great war.... NOT, it was more of a school play, and a very boring one.
It's real problem, though, is that ultimately it's a polite, clean and determinedly inoffensive film about a dirty, ugly war.
Eventually he can take no more, divorces his wife and goes off to write what he pleases in peace, leaving his wife to marry a long-time admirer (Irving Pichel) who provides her with money and status even though she is not in love with him.
In short, I hated his character, which ruined the film for me, even though without those qualities there would not have been a film.
The acting was sub-par at best, though I would say it may be Chris Kattan's best job yet.
The angle is more so serious and dark, though at times with a somewhat mock attitude compared with the plain outlandish, and overly campy style of the original.
Even though Chris Kattan was right up there with the other moving mannequins, he at least had some humorous lines.
The problem is that even though the characters actions made no sense through the movie, it wasn't funny.
It's dull, seems incredibly long (though isn't)and even the odd gore scene which aren't very frequent or impressive do little to relieve the boredom.
Oh, she can't renounce her vows (even though technically she *can*).
Even though she admits she still loves Gable and wouldn't have gone through with it if she'd found out he survived.
A few seconds later the "rest of his life" is cut short (with just enough time to say Goodbye again though!)
Other welcome and familiar faces include Edward Arnold as a sympathetic priest (like Gable, though, he's seen to better advantage in earthy or roguish parts); Louise Closser Hale as Angela's duenna/companion, and May Robson as the Mother Superior.
The story is incomprehensible, and seems as though it were 2 movies spliced together.
Acting is dull and unconvincing, though William Atherton is on board to lend his trademarked sneer to the chief villain.
Mostly though, we get a bunch of aerial shots of bikes/cars/Battletruck driving through the wasteland.
If you can get it for free though, go ahead and watch it.
This movie pushes itself even further, though, when it kicks the cheap cry pedal.
The supporting players were good, though the always terrific Jane Krakowski didn't get enough to do, her amorous dancer deserved more screen time.
No fault of Emma, but that movie, though having an excellent story, suffered from a poor approach that turned a plucky heroine into an nerd!
My personal favorite though, is the late model BMW convertible that, just before exploding, turns into a not so late model BMW 4-door sedan.
Is this the same Steven we saw 6 months earlier from Exit Wounds?The Raspy voice.Sudden Weight gain.There is not even a decent fight scene in the whole movie?I did not buy the Zen style he talked up.I suspect it is not all his fault here though.
Just that my 2 out of 10 rank is because there are some average battle scenes and incredibly you have the feeling that producers didn't try to save money though the outcome also looks cheap.
This is one of the movies that just falls under the genre of "infamously terrible," and though the idea of John Wayne as Genghis Khan in and of itself is laughable, I wanted to see for myself why, exactly, it deserved such ignominy.
But worse are the montages- aside from Bratz, which is in a league of its own, this is some of the just, well, inept editing I've seen in many a moon, particularly at the beginning and end where it seems as though nobody even watched the f***ing last 9/10ths of the movie that came before or after it!
It was as though the veterans of the series were just going through the motions because they had resigned themselves (with great resentment) to being typecast and performed mechanically out of some sort of obligation (or necessity?).
I have not read the David Leavitt novel on which this film is based, and though I'm certainly keen to do so, I do not believe it would be a prerequisite for any sensible person to follow the storyline or to empathise with the struggles and joys of these characters.
Adrian Paul is a really talented actor & though I feel their acting was dead on... the script for this movie was HORRIBLE.
My recommendation to you though is to save your penny.
The leads, Stephen Baldwin and Kristy Swanson are just going through the motions, though they do hold the film together, and Swanson looks very healthy.
Of course even though he's married to a stunning women, he feels chemistry with Laura and vice versa.
The character who helped to rape her, Max seems filled with guilt at some times and others he acts as though she is an old girlfriend who is simply pesky.
The ending feels as though it has been tacked on from another film.
His rapid tracking shots through branches of trees, as though the nature conspires to ensnare the protagonists, the amazing clarity of the closeups, the maize of hand-held shots thrusting the viewer right there in the middle of the action, the beautiful dutch angles transforming the geography of the landscape into something that can only exist for and by the camera.
Actually I'd like to see a Celebrity death match with Rambo and Braddock, though it wouldn't be much of a fight.
This film is pretty easy to laugh at though, but I don't think it was meant to be funny.
Don't get me wrong though, it's not refreshing.
Warning though, non-sequiturs abound.
The acting and cast in the movie is alright, though some of the dialogue is a bit weak.
Well not overly scary, could have used some extra touches, but not a bottomscraper in any way though.
Let this be a lead up to something more scare in its wake, no need to bring out the pillows while watching this one though.
It IS good for one thing, though.
As it is, though, "License to Wed" is a painful experience that you will have no trouble leaving stranded at the altar.
There are a lot of gags that fall flat though.
I felt as though I had been hoodwinked about fifteen minutes into this movie.
It begins almost at the outset where a police patrol plane begins to strafe the smugglers plane with machine gun fire even though it suspects it has people hidden in it, continues as the smuggling pilot remedies the situation and then goes on from there.
It's supposed to be a metaphor for the struggle between the rich and the proletariat, though the comparison is stupid--the "worker" is a mafioso--hardly a man of the people.
And this rich lady is less interesting, being more one-dimensional, than the one appearing in Swept Away, even though both were played by the same fine actress, Mariangela Melato.
That's just speculation on my behalf, though.
Guy's brother dies so he comes out of retirement to take his place (even though he hasn't flown in years and can just simply hop a plane) and avenge him, female pilot gets heckled for being a female and calls them on it, guy falls in love with female and everyone sees it coming, and my favorite....guy breaks out of prison and proceeds to take out 30 guys single handedly armed with barely anything.
Camera is the piece of film that made me realise the genius of David Cronenberg, even though I had loved most of the films I have seen by him I now have a more profound respect for him and I'm going to watch all of his work that I can get my hands into.
I consider myself a relatively big fan of the giallo genre, though I haven't seen nearly as many as some that I talk too - but I figure at this point I've seen enough to separate the notable entries from the weaker ones - and WHO SAW HER DIE?
The storyline gets confused and redundant after the daughter's murder, characters are introduced who are thinly explained, and the "resolution" is dumb and forced as though the director couldn't find an adequate way to tie the film together.
Having previously enjoyed Constantinos Giannaris's 'From The Edge Of The City', flawed though it was, I imagined this film might represent a coming to fruition of this director's potential.
Aside from the prostitutes and a scene with urine-tossing though, QUEST is inoffensive enough, and manages to cram more idiocy into its approx.
The MST version was funny, though not one of their best efforts.
By the end (which was such a WTF moment that I ceased to exist caring) I was though even trying to care what the hell was going on.
It was as though the adults of the time sensed the coming of the hippie generation and were trying to hold on to their old way of life by brainwashing the youth of America into being good.
And even though almost every character in this film is repugnant, it's even more repugnant to cut their legs off and ask them to walk.
It serves as a reminder that Jacey, though precocious, is only 16 and capable of erring.
Even though I haven't had a pleasure of being introduced to Mr. Paez's music, I am absolutely positive he is a great composer.
No, the plot wasn't rushed; even worse - it was as though the while plot was shown but it was a rushed story to begin with!
It seemed as though the creators were trying way too hard to make this just like "Scary Movie", but it wasn't even close.
There's not much to say about this one; every single gag falls completely flat - even though it's parodying a lot of the same flicks that Not Another Teen Movie went after.
Even though slightly long and very boring at times, It has a JW signature written all over it and is a must for any of his fans.
Not nearly as shocking as, say "Pink Flamingos" or "Female Trouble", though it is strange enough to hold your attention.
Even though she is dying to have a baby herself, she supports Jacey, directs her to a support group for teen-age mothers, and you see Jacey becoming stronger, even bringing the support group to her school to talk about the consequences of teen-age pregnancy and motherhood, and admitting to her classmates that little Charlie is really her son.
Sadly, watching the video her sister made at the hospital, which makes it look as though she was forced into this arrangement by her mother, has the opposite effect on her.
The company is unhappy about the whole Zangora situation though and hires Shannon to make a coup.
It's a happy ending though because the guy who finally sits on the throne is a doctor and an idealist, and we are compelled to hope he remains that way instead of discovering that, hey, it's good to be the king.
Not a good reason to give this a thumbs up, though.
Alas, although the knight's role is little more than a cameo in Alice, the writers here have mercilessly expanded the part, even though it meant treading on the lines of more capable players like break-your-heart Rita La Roy (a most engaging and super-attractively regal young duchess) and Kay Hughes' pleasing Cheshire Cat who, as we might expect, disappears from the action, alas, for long spells.
The scene where Moe and Larry are going through lockers looking for the stolen ring is somewhat of a quandary to me though.
Such story is not anything new though and tales of such content have long existed in the western mythology.
This entry into the seemingly never-ending Godzilla series includes an irritating little boy who says 'Papaaaaaaa' a lot, a storyline that feels as though it was put together with very little thought, occasional silly cartoon sequences showing Hedora doing nasty things, slabs of tedium and two almost identical endings, one after the other.
It showed that even though those girls have kids they are still just like us.
Alida Valli is the placid widow of a wealthy, blind British Colonel who was poisoned; she's charged with his murder and is defended by barrister Gregory Peck, a married man with an impeccable courtroom track record who immediately becomes obsessed with her even though she seems to regard him with disdain.
Hitchcock, working from a screenplay adapted from Robert Hichens' novel by wife Alma Reville (though others put in their two cents, to Hitch's displeasure), cannot seem to elicit any interesting facets from Valli as an actress--or perhaps he meant to keep her stone-cold?
There are possible compensations though.
He ain't no action hero, though.
Well, MST3K had a hell of a lot of fun with this, though the host segments coulda been better (except the "Canada Bashing" song and Mike the Prospector).
Finally, when it seems as though these villains are about to catch Troy, he hops into the back of a truck.
However..."The Blair Witch Project" (though I'm no fan) was low-budget yet has become a cult phenomenon.
What makes this film so unpleasant and non-funny is that the film, though inept, is also a bit like being inside the mind of a sex pervert murderer--and seeing his depravity up close and in person.
I will give him one credit though - his shots of the streets of Hollywood are done well, and the more to his credit is the cheapness of his film equipment: Steckler made this film as a silent film with a shoulder held camera.
This, though, does not mean its a bad film.
I won't give it away, though I almost already have.
Come to think of it though, judging from has last couple of movies, Eddie Murphy is no longer a comic or an actor.
The real stars of the film though are the little kids.
The rack twirl got me, though.
Not all is lost, though.
I liked the whole switching of the shooting sides that Freddie does near the end though, I thought that was a neat addition.
We may be in the 9th episode but Data already has learned a lot about humans, though surely not enough to prevent any conflict sufficient to know what is considered important.
It deals with being isolated even though you have family.
Superstar though he may have been, I have to confess that I was never that impressed with Bob Hope's comedy.
The granddaughter is forbidden to see the grandmother as an eleven year old child but then makes no effort to see her as an adult even though she professes undying love for her?
Don't worry about catching it on the festival circuit though, wait a couple of weeks and watch it on Lifetime where it belongs.
Still, there is nothing to prepare us for Mary Tyler Moore looking fairly young -- though awfully skeletal, probably due to the actress's (type 1) diabetes -- and her "best friend" Millie looking like a fossil from the pre-Cambrian era.
(Carl Reiner -- "Alan Lester Brady" -- is actually just slightly older than Dick Van Dyke but looks much older; this is fine, though, considering the work relationship in the show.)
Too bad though that the actors didn't really get a chance to show what they can do (see above.)
The worst, though, was that the story was so messy.
Was she in love with both of them or just in love with love, even though she commented, continuously, about not believing in love.
The film is mostly a one-lady show where Julie Harris plays a 12 year-old even though she was in her mid-late 20s when she did this.
And even though they are supposed to be hiding in the country they spend a lot of time driving around in a fire engine red mustang, going to the park and stuff.
The best scene though, in any film PERIOD and the scene that is worth renting the film for is where Patty and her retarded gal pals are in that awesome mustang headed back to grandmas house in the country and her friend is reading a letter from her husband who is a soldier.
The slapstick is poorly staged and looks as though it was made up on the spot.
In fact, Gavroche may have been the only character whose original attitude and appearance remained the same, though many of his scenes were cut entirely and he served more as a messanger than anything.
Many loved it, though.
However, I don't like the film very much, even though it is quite faithful to the book in both content and tone; for in spite of this, it has lost the spark, and the vision, that the writing possessed, and appears coarse and clumsy in comparison.
Not only did the script completely lack any true depth, but also R.Kelly's performance as the singing narrator was accidentally comedic relief, as the whole film was, though not intended to be.
As you will see, the mastermind behind this project avidly discusses what is written on the back of the DVD box which, though already unintelligent blather about cliffhangers, sounds dumber coming out of R.Kelly's mouth.
Darn funny stuff though!
The two films have certain similarities inasmuch that also in 'Solas' the accent is very much on strong characterisation, profound human feelings, though perhaps a little less intense here than in AlmodÃ³var's film.
For most of the people involved, this was their first and last film; one that I would have liked to see in more is former Miss California (or so the Troma DVD cover claims) Elizabeth Key, who is not only beautiful (though the nudity is provided by the other leading lady, Gloria Lusiak), but a pretty funny comedienne as well.
Even though it's only 68 minutes long it felt much longer.
The film fails to generate any kind of sympathy for it's characters, and even though the acts being committed are horrifying and sick, it's hard to care...which just makes it boring.
In my opinion, though, this movie was lacking.
Even though the TV show manages to make us laugh at the same things over and over, it still has variety to it, and each season kicks ass (even season 6, which a lot of people dislike).
There were a lot of problems I had with this movie, though.
It was as though Mr. Altman threw a lot of balls into the air, hoping one of them would hit.
It is as though Altman and crew were ALL on psychotropic drugs during the making of this film.
No control device is ever shown, though many references are made to the incredible amounts of technology which the student-bad-guys are using.
This monstrosity of a film was cheekily re released again to look as though it was a new Uma film, I have seen it floating around on DVD in second hand shops and car boot sales on numerous occasions - and now I know why.
great score though.
And even though I love war movies/series such as Band of Brothers, even put in that light, this series has little or nothing to recommend it.
It did feel like a chore though, wading through so much crap just to get to the end.
I feel that, even though I really don't want to, I should maybe watch this film again - to maybe see if I missed out any important details or something because from my experience this film has very little to redeem its creation.
This plot line, though can be used once in a while if it's done once in a while, gets tiring after a while.
Meanwhile, the parents of the kidnapped girl have also arrived in the jungle (don't ask me how, though), but they're good people and hence don't get eaten.
Bedrock looks OK you can easily see that they've spent a lot of time working on it trying to make it look just like the cartoon but the story compared to the one the cartoon has is a definite insult just look at the ratings that this movie has here at IMDB 4.4 right now (March 7th 2000) those guys at Universal should have back in 1993 (when they were writing the script) well the story is really bad let's make a movie combining 4 of the most popular episodes in one story that would have been a very good idea I'm sure that it would have had made much more money than the 358.5 million it made worldwide even though that is a lot I know that if they had a better story it would have like 500M or more.
I expect something better with the prequel that is coming out this summer even though I don't think the people they chose to be the new Flintstones look like them as the first cast did.
The Idea behind the movie is okay though: the grandmother who feels forced to "jerk off" lots of men in the sexclub, in order to get the money it takes to save her ill grandson from dying.
This seems to be more of a flaw from the director and/or scriptwriter though, and not the actors themselves.
So in that sense, I guess it kind of is a comedy...  All I can say is though... Avoid this movie for your own sake.
The cartoons are much better than this movie though.
He is giggly and a bit dumb, not quite as good as the cartoon though.
There are few truly funny moments, and though the actors do their best, they can't save the movie from being dull, silly, and in parts very sappy.
though).
I did wonder about her customers though.
Paying for sex is at bottom, so to speak, pretty pathetic, even for someone with Erina's professional skill, and the film makes little attempt to look at the situation from the customer's viewpoint, though we do get the impression the customers are satisfied.
However it was fun seeing Adam Ant and Mary Woronov as part of the tribe (even though they have no dialogue).
And though not a master, Crime Spree also steals liberally from Guy Ritchie as well, right down to the bridge scene in Lock Stock.
The great thing though is that in spite of all these minor niggles, the film really hits the spot.
This is probably the best I have seen from them though.
In this film, she emerges as a greater actor than singer (though her Pirate Jenny from the Threepenny Opera may be the best version of the song in English).
The plot centers around a widowed grandmother, and her son and daughter-in-law, and their plight to get medical help for the grandson/son, though we are never told just what he has, and for most of the scenes we see him in, he looks okay really.
The only thing worthwhile in this movie is a) the soundtrack (which was fitting), b) the cinematography (which was mostly fitting, good high key lighting, good color combination, fitting aura.. even though the Mise en Scene lacked originality or thought.. docks and guns..
And even though his Irish(yes, apparently Bison is Irish) parents died just after he was born and he was raised on the streets of Bangkok with nothing but Thai people, adult Bison somehow managed to retain a spot-on Irish accent.
The name is pretty much all you get though.
The film ends with Gen meeting Chun Li with an ad for the "Street Fighter" tournament, hinting that Bison is behind it even though he was (seemingly?)
It's a shame he had to be in this pile of crud though.
At times it was funny though, but not intentionally.
Am I supposed to feel for Chun Li, even though she had a privileged life, and a loving mother?
as though they were cockroachs, or vermin of some sort.
Its a tired story anyway which has been done many times before and surely better though I haven't watched this type of film as I know what it is going to be like boring and unfunny.
No matter, though, Shore whines his way through the rest of the movie, making no real attempt to revive his career or even (God forbid!)
Ultimately, though, Shore is caught, and is sent to jail for reasons not explained very well in the film.
More than that, though, since Shore has been out of the A-list spotlight for a decade now, you never know how much of this movie is fact or fiction.
The writing isn't the only bad part, though, the whole thing is done on digital film because (educated guess) it's cheaper.
Some of the movie is shot like a conventional story and some is shot as though there were an inexplicable camera catching people's private reactions to the news... it just didn't work.
Even though this is an obvious self-mockery, Shore seems to take himself very seriously to think people actually want to see him write and direct his own film, as if to say "hey, guys - I'm in on the joke too!"
Even though Pauly Shore clearly can't write, I think I'm one of the few that really enjoyed his early films.
Overall, pretty good film, though.
Even though Maggies knew job is far from what she expected it to be, she Accepts it because of Olly.
However though, I'm still an unabashed and devout sucker for flicks from and or set (which is this one's case) in the 1970's no matter how poorly made, overlong, demented, disjointed, incoherent, lame etc.
Lila (Susan Stewart) actually does a decent (not good though) job as the stripper/killer.
Abhishek was good, though his character didn't seem to be well-defined enough.
Doesn't pretend to feel pity, and even though the beginning might be even considered dramatic, it made me laugh out loud several times.
This is very wrong though but very obvious and unavoidable also.
The songs, though melodiously rendered, are far too many in number and get on one's nerves after a while.
Edward G Robinson never disappoints (even though he does kind of sound like Chico Marx in this) and Richard Conte is great.
Legally questionable, though horrific.
Well, now I know where Tin Soldier (1995) and Bogus (1996) came from, though why there was a need to make the same dull, silly movie THREE TIMES I can't tell.
It is as though the writer came up with what he thought was a good idea, and then after writing a few pages realised that in fact he still had writer's block.
Even though the plot isn't really clear to me (or to anyone, I suppose) it seems to handle about a guy whose actions are controlled by the devil, because there's an ancient curse on his bloodline.
If you'll excuse me though, I have to go shove a burning ember into my nose in the hopes that it will reach my brain and burn the memories of it from my mind.
It did make me laugh as hard (or perhaps even harder at times) as with the first one, though maybe the enjoyment I got out of DEATHSTALKER II might be a bit less, how shall I put it... satisfying?
Even if the film hardly appears as entirely interesting you may want to see the crowd of brides chasing hapless Bachelor down the streets, but hardly anything else here produces great moments, though it doesn't irritate much either.
I saw "The Bachelor" tonight with my boyfriend at the dollar theater tonight, and even though I loved the classic romantic story, and even got a few laughs out of it, I noticed some subtle messages in the movie that disturb me.
The usual odd Ub Iwerks style of animation is there and it's quite charming, though as I just saw it immediately after PLANE CRAZY and STEAMBOAT WILLIE, it just didn't seem as entertaining or clever.
And Renee Zellweger is fine, even though her cinematic persona has by now overstayed its welcome.
The cinematography was stunning though, that is in part why I chose to watch this movie.
I give it a 2 because the photography was OK, though I don't think this is enough reason to make a film of this caliber.
There are some redemptive traits, though.
They never really talk or screw each other, though.
The acting is wooden throughout though worse than usual as it appears as if all the actors have been heavily doped with some sedative the slow, deliberate way they ponderously shuffle about.
I did like the skinny white guy though.
Even though she was the first runner-up for the New York Film Critics Award, Faye Dunaway disavows her performance as screen icon Joan Crawford because the camp following this 1981 potboiler has developed over the years has probably been overwhelming.
It was all too shallow, as though nobody really wanted to get too heavy.
Somehow this bright, beautiful 20-year-old has managed to get through her entire life, including four years of college, without once meeting a person who has affirmed her intelligence and her creativity, even though she's smart enough to have been accepted into Harvard Law.
Even though the aliens are 2-3 feet tall, the passageways to their structure is conveniently sized for humans to be comfortable.
The acting was pitiful the whole way through though.
Simply put: even though he had cowed to the Amerikan Way, the military would NOT have left Lancaster to live in peace in his newly-created outer 'burb of White-Man-Ville.
The action is really where this movie hits the spot, though.
What made the film though was Freeze himself.
Even though this film deals with a very real threat and demonstrates people under panic moving with pure instinct, as a piece of film, as the story winds on, the viewer finds themselves questioning how much longer the film will go on.
He still leaves the phone and dust covered with a blanket though!!
As paradoxical as that sounds it's as though they thought the world and those around them were vile, worthless trash, and took it upon themselves to become that.
As some other reviewers have pointed out, even though this character is meant to be satirical it quickly becomes irritating and one-note.
The creators left their funny in the show though, it seems.
Even though I didn't smoke pot, I still felt like I did about half-way through the blathering non-existent plot, stop and notice the insanity and ask yourself what's going on as you see two people leaving the theater movie.
Not that this serial is all that much better though it is a cut above most of them, but one of the things that struck me was that each chapter stood more on its own than you would normally have.
This movie, even though it was animated, was serious, realistic, and had a great plot.
The Mother of Mena and her brother can understand the radio, even though she's a zombie.
Since then though it's been slightly down hill with some poor further attempts released.
I find it difficult to see the zombies as 'zombies' though.
Don't show it to anyone though, just watch it yourself.
Inexplicably, Maj. John Pitcairn, commanding the advance party, picks a fight with the men, even though they do not block his path.
The movie is more of an 'urban drama' than an all-out horror film, which is fine, though the characters were just far too one-dimensional and it comes as no surprise this guy decides to run around with a deadly piece of hardware since there is absolutely no change in his demeanor to indicate exactly WHEN he has officially lost his mind.
The death scenes, though extremely gory, are portrayed as much too "in your face" and detracts from any kind of feeling of menace these scenes had or could've had.
I remember forcing myself to look at their "masterpieces" and compliment them, even though they had little or no talent.
It looked as though it was trying to be an art-house movie, only with some B-rate exploitation in the mix.
There's some details I've left out but while there's some interesting developments later in the narrative, especially at the end, it's mostly pretty repetitious concerning the killings though there's also a sexy shower scene with the female roommates and some pretty entertaining guitar licks during the punk band scenes as well as one amusing scene at a bus stop with one derelict constantly bothering other patrons.
Knowing this director later made the cult movie Ms. 45, which I have yet to watch, I approached this movie with some interest but I'd only recommend The Driller Killer if you're interested in anything Mr. Ferrara made and not if you want to watch a slasher flick (though those drill scenes can be fascinating to watch).
Firing is heard all around, though no one is exactly sure from where or by whom.
It leads nowhere, though.
The film is dubbed even though you can see Jackie talking english, the backgrounds and action scenes are very low quality, and most of all, Jackie Chan shows us once again that his humor gets old all because of his lack of acting skills.
While I loved Roberto Begnini in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL and JOHNNY STECCHINO, I really had a hard time enjoying this film--though fortunately it got better as the film progressed.
This portion of the film is actually pretty sweet, as he works so hard to keep her alive--it's quite touching,...though once again, I had to remind myself that he IS a stalker and traveled a couple thousand miles into a war zone because of his bizarre obsession.
Strengths of the film were Begnini's performance (though at times, it did come off as essentially the same guy he was in LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL) and the latter half of the film (while not great--it was light-years ahead of the first half).
The plot is about these losers who still live at home, unemployed 40-year-olds who live with their mother and father they meet and they develop a relationship and get married Ferrel and Reilly hate each other and Ferrel does the worst thing in any comedy movie (besides Charlies Angels 2 with hiring those writers(even though writers isn't a word to describe them) he puts his balls on Reilly's drum set (no wonder earlier in this piece of crap he said "Don't touch my drum set") and then they find out they have more in common and they decide to start a new music band (REPLACE THE DRUM SET) and then Ferrels younger brother is in town this guy is a success with a love relationship Ferrel says he's an ###hole and the brother sells their house and they try to get it back by doing the unthinkable like dressing up as Natzi's and putting makeup on Ferrel's face trying to make out he's dead (if only it was real) and later Ferrel's younger brother runs out of people to sell it to and one night they release their first music video see they wanted to be in this band with 2 people the step-brothers and Reilly's father owns a boat and that's where they were filming it while it was in the water with nobody driving it.
Unfortunately though, the aisles and exits at the theatre I saw Step Brothers at were clogged with spectators who, beyond any intelligible reason as far as I can tell, were amused enough by the first 100 minutes to stick around for the encore, so I was stuck.
I find one parallel with Knight Rider, though: In the pilot of Knight Rider, Michael Knight is almost killed, and then reconstructed with essentially a new body.
The 80's series was a classic even though I do think that David Hasselhoff is an absolutely shambolic actor, which really comes through when he plays two roles in the episodes "Goliath" and "Goliath Returns".
Margaret and Charles Lewin will not concede without a fight though, and they enlist an African-American attorney to represent their cause.
All the acting is of a good standard, though never to the height it could have been.
Noah Wylie was suitable as our hero, though I was most impressed by Sonja Walger as the brawn of the operation.
But its potentials were ruined by its laughable plot (though I understand the producers looked for something rather comic) and terrible screenplay.
As a result, the films, though popular in their day, were just awful by today's standards.
It's somehow not surprising that she has to keep visiting a shrink though she doesn't seem to improve from the visits.
She is supposedly going to spend the night at a friend's house, though the friend never shows up and no one seems to think that's strange.
The fools also, though by now it's obvious that the little men are afraid of the light, never turn on the lights.
What I will say though is that as a teenager, on the first couple of viewings, I lost interest after Carol turns up instead of Dorothy to tell Gregory she's not coming.
I guess though that says more about me at that time than anything else.
Even though there are lots of surreal moments this film seems to be one of the most realistic portrayals of a school; the children all seem like real school children, at least from a British perspective.
Sorority House Massacre just has to be the most hysterical slasher movie of the mid to late 80's even though it was never intended to be this way!
Still, I'd watch this movie again and again, it's as good as any horror spoof even though we're not supposed to snigger when one of the girls gets butchered and her stud boyfriend runs into the house naked except for some sneakers and cheesy white socks, sprouting, in a deep jock voice with twitching eyebrows "Some guy just killed Tracy"...Classic!!!
I'm not a Moore fan (though i do agree with some of his conclusions) and it was originally this and the promise of some insightful discourse on the nature of his technique that attracted me to the film.
It's not as though he stitched together individual words or cut sentences short to change their meaning.
But I hope some people in Tinsel town have the courage to acknowledge that whilst some of the visuals are outstanding (though many are not - e.g.
This film, originally titled Outer Touch but now called by its American title, Spaced Out, is getting a bit of a cult following though why this should be is a bit of a mystery because it isn't really that good.
Even though at the end of the day it's still a mess with the story all over the place.
Even though the film suffers from poor dubbing, synching (it feels like you're watching an old Hong Kong Kung Fu flick), the film has a sense of dread from beginning to end that grabbed me.
The film seems to want to explore the two female leads, though it does so with no emotional attachment for the viewer.
Of course, this "program-clip" is referred to as a virus, a generic Hollywood name for anything that is not from AOL or Microsoft, even though it is the precise opposite of a virus - not only does it not replicate, but it removes itself.
It is there where idiotic people like me pick it upÂ It could be worse, though.
D+ for effort though.
Except for the male lead who was a very, very bad actor, though extremely cute.
For me, though, "Gregory's Girl" strikes the most perfect balance and is never less than highly engaging.
Even though I am a guy I didn't like this movie one bit.
Now don't get me wrong even though I am a guy I still enjoy some chick flicks like Down to You, 10 Things I Hate About You, and Boys and Girls.
This one was just dull really had no humorus moments, and it was set as though it happens but in a unrealistic way.
(Girls seem to like the movie though.)
He wasn't very good during the serious scenes though.
as though required by movie convention.
In particular, when the boyfriend forced his way on to the radio station's air waves as though he had to do something desperate and gritty to get Halley's attention, I wondered why he hadn't thought to simply go to her house or call her on the phone.
He fares better than the rest of the cast, though.
Even though the movie picks up a pace at the ending, the overall lousy acting by ALL actors doesn't help the semi-interesting what-if story make an interesting movie.
I didn't like the plot and even though they tried to dramatize it a little bit at the end it doesn't compensate and it will leave instead of Âwanting more', Âwanting something'.
But since its sci-fi, I can't go into much detail because at the end it's just not real even though some sci-fi films seem more believable than this.
It is impressive though that they singled out a credible event that could have changed history.. it seemed like a good movie for a few minutes but......   Could have been an OK movie in an alternative time-line.. where pathetic predictable crap isn't allowed.
I caught it from around the beginning and thought it was a Japanese movie somehow on the foreign movie channel - Japanese actors, Japanese dialog (even though the lead still had a bit of an accent).
Elias finally grows tired of the childishness (though not soon enough for me), and Alby finds himself hitchhiking through Florida in one of the most strained, toilsome road movies I've ever seen.
The cinematography is excellent, though, and the supporting cast, especially TV-veteran Edward Winter (best performance in film) is surprisingly robust, considering the material (EXCEPT Bo Derek, or course, whose notoriety from 10 is one of the reasons this was rushed to the big screen prematurely.
Bill Diehl was good though and Michelle Williams was cute as the young yet (cliched) old soul.
even though the characters names are the same they look nothing alike, it isn't the same person.
Don't ask me how I did it, but even though this is technically a botched and splicey patchwork of a movie, I had a good time with it.
The original film, PSYCHO A GO-GO was actually one of Adamson's best films (though its current rating of 2.0 is hardly stellar).
2 bit actors attempting to look as though they are being filmed without their knowledge.
The overall feeling though was not one of hatred...this is just an overplotted mess, with moderate entertainment value throughout.
I'm unsure as to why a mummy movie needs any cutesy moments, but since this is meant for families, writer and director Stephen Sommers made this both violent and cutesy and comedic, so it never fully works as anything (though it does work much better as an action movie than anything else).
The horribly conceived "it's time to grow up" moment in question though is when Sam (Shane Powers), a friend of Jacksons, kills himself because he's also secretly in love with him!
Little Pal did become a Jolson standard though not to the same degree as Sonny Boy.
Even though I haven't seen the American version of this show, and have no wish to, it does beg the question, why can't American TV execs watch a British comedy without saying "that's a good programme, very popular, lets do it ourselves" And ruin it.
This is a minor point, though.
DD earlier made remarkable comedies though illogical yet funny  This is a weird film by him, he tried the MASTI formula and brought an identical story of 3 guys who hav 3 wives and search for love outside even the characters are similar  The comedy scenes are so cringe worthy, it looks like we are watching a stage play, the dialogues too are damn stage like  The spiderman jokes are so bizarre while the Sanju angle and all other stuff is contrived  The ending is the worst part of the film  Direction by DD is bad Music is ordinary  Camera-work is only saving grace  Amongst actors Fardeen Khan and Zayed Khan shout too loud and act artificially mostly Sharman excels in his part, though this isn't a patch of his best works Amongst girls Esha overacts, Ayesha is just there and the rest are all bad Sanjay is plain horrible, he hams it up badly
Even though I thought I knew all the funny bits after seeing it so many times, each viewing finds me laughing at things I hadn't noticed before, as well as at all the other bits that never seem to grow stale.
Nicely though somewhat statically directed by Michael Curtiz, The Matrimonial Bed also features some nifty set design and a few memorable shots in silhouette.
Fans of "Last of the Summer Wine" (though it had stronger character development) or "The Vicar of Dibley" (if you thought the humor in the latter is too intrusive) will doubtless take to this series like ducks to water, but others be warned: this has nothing of the warm character development of "All Creatures Great and Small" or the sophisticated humor of "Yes Minister" or "Hot Lead" (but also blessedly none of the camp of "Are You Being Served").
Perhaps, though, "Sum of all Fears" is just a blip in Clancy's writing career.
There's dumb-fun in watching this thing play out--if you're not too demanding--though one persistent question remains: why was the priest wearing fingernail polish?
As a result I find it difficult to believe that Tom Clancy had much creative control over this effort, though he's credited as "Executive Producer".
It's Super-Ryan to the rescue, more 007 than distinguished, cerebral CIA analyst, even though he supposedly had little if any experience in espionage, forensics, or any of that.
Clancy seemed to know that when he wrote the book; he seems to have forgotten it here though.
Lassie's crossing of a river's broken bridge, to save her master, it a film highlight; though, it's difficult to accept Lassie was ever afraid of water.
The ending seems pretentious and though the intention seems to be that the audience should join in the nod and wink the film, having failed to bring us in on the side of its protagonists leaves us unwilling or unable to do so.
says the elderly woman slyly after Uncle Charlie introduces himself, and believe me, you will know every sundry detail of Uncle Charlie's hard knock life, even though it's probably better that you didn't.
He does a fine job bringing some much needed credibility, though I must confess seeing him drive in a convertible in black slacks, a black turtleneck, and a black beret is something not to be missed.
I first became aware of this via the Blue Underground DVD, though I was not intrigued enough by the online reviews to acquire it; however, coming my way recently while being in a "Nunsploitation" frame-of-mind, I could not very well let the opportunity pass me by (in hindsight, the English dubbing is atrocious Â even if the print reverted for a couple of brief scenes to the original Italian language).
in which each of the protagonists spit out their hatred of the male species; for what it is worth, though clearly unbalanced and given to foul-mouthed outbursts, Ekberg is not the homicidal sister of the title but a victim of circumstance and rejected affection.
The writing is something out of an afternoon soapie (though even those shows have enough pride not to hand out this many clichÃ©s, usually).
A thoroughly conventional, though Oscar-nominated, score doesn't help, and Jack Oakie, as Darnell's vaudeville partner, provides what little energy there is.
I won't ruin it for anyone (even though there's nothing to really ruin), but you pretty much know how the story is going play out within the first five minutes.
I didn't say he does it well though.
After 10 minutes, a reverse triple summersault in the pike position out of my window 12th floor window seemed preferable to siting though the rest of this rubbish.
Saving graces: sealed windows, i didn't rent the film but watched it on cable...though i am tempted to unsubscribe after this, and, finally, this "film" got my mind back on doing some out of work reading on the financial markets.
My favourite scene in the film is when Mr. No Legs is facing up to someone who wants to kill him, Mr. No Legs climbs out of his chair & puts his fists up to the guy even though without legs Mr. No Legs doesn't reach past his waist!
There are some neat car stunts, a few nice fight scenes & some truly memorable sequences featuring Mr. No Legs as the toughest & meanest guy in the film even though he hasn't any legs.
Daredevil has a new enemy though, the super-enhanced Bullseye (Colin Farrell), who never misses his targets, hired by big villain Wilson Fisk, aka The Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan).
There are some good special effects, I didn't think Farrell was that bad, and even though the premise of a blind superhero is ridiculous nonsense, there is still some fun to be had.
Even though when I buy a film like this I don't really expect good acting, story, or quality I buy them anyway just in case there is some good fighting / scenes in there.
Loughlin's character is one-dimensional too, though she looks like she tries hard.
The oldest son is brooding, blonde, and is learning to surf, stating in the pilot "I prefer surfing" though he lived in Kansas.
I don't know why Morgan Brittany was in this though since her character didn't really do anything of any importance.
Sadly though, the movie just doesn't cut it.
And honestly, the best and most interesting characters were treated somewhat like extras, though one of those "extras" was by far the best actress in the movie.
Megan Mullaly makes a good job of her role, though Martin Lawrence looks uncomfortable and overwhelmed by his.
As a sequel to a Cronenberg movie, though, it could have been much worse.
The only thing remotely okay in this movie is the FX, even though it's all used to show disgusting gore that the viewing audience doesn't really want to see.
I wouldn't say though that the acting was superb, but it was descent.
Oh man...  For better entries in this sub-genera (I'm picking more obscure ones) try, "Death Weekend," "Fortress," or even "Rituals" even though that last one is more of a "Deliverance" copy than anything else.
Decidedly adult-oriented slapstick-comedy, though it was originally marketed towards the younger crowds, that has two very different brothers (played by comedians Nathan Lane and Lee Evans) suddenly left broke and homeless directly resulting from a couple of disturbing and rather unfunny circumstances.
Some curious cameos are also featured here from a number of character actors that are passable considering all, though to be honest I'm still scratching my head as to why any of them would have actually made appearances in this flick in the first place; the actors I'm in reference to are: Maury Chakin, Christopher Walkin (!?
One cool thing though is the ring, worn by the priest, it's like a snake with a hypo on the end that dispenses curare, the better to make zombies with.
Even though it begins to lose its puff towards the end, gladly the time still breezes by if transparently.
This is resolutely typical post SCREAM/I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER fare (supposedly from the "author" of the latter) with offscreen violence, but the performances are surprisingly good and it's watchable, though it all seems like a big build-up to nothing by the end.
It's short on action most of the time, with plenty of unintentional laughs though.
Now you probably are immediately reminded of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy's films, though there were some that came out before theirs that were actually far more difficult to stomach--the films were so old fashioned and the singing so dreadful.
).If you're a gore-hound then you will be able to handle this little flick(there are better gorefests,though),but if you like scary horror movies avoid this trash like the plague.3 out of 10.
I won't give out any spoilers even though I hated this movie...but here's why!
Well once again a DVD box at the rental store drew me into a wasted night.Who could resist a movie that claims to have been banned in 37 countries?So ,even though by now I should know better,I rent this thing and take it home.
But still, even though the idea was great in the end it was the ham fisted execution of the concept that will probably make any self respecting movie go-er recoil in horror the most.
or that andie would quit her job or even the story because of how she feels (even though she hated it anyway).
This will be rather subjective but I like the lady a lot despite her fashion style (she never appear cheap though, so treat her with respect).
The plot such as it is is strange in that there are no vampires next door even though plot synopsis of the movie says there is.
Even though she is already 36 in this one, for many years she was ageless in the beauty department.
I think Kasdan might be lost though.
I don't believe this, though, for two reasons: a) What growth?
Barbara Stanwyck and Adolphe Menjou fare better, but Joseph Calleia's mobster is unintentionally funnier than Joe Piscopo's Danny Vermin in Johnnv Dangerously, though he does at least flick a mean cigarette.
Even though I don't care for movies about infidelity, I wanted to see this particular one anyways.
The really crazy clothes, definitely the 80's hair styles (even though this was done in the 90's), and acting are at the bottom of the barrel and highly worth viewing.
I went to see my ageing parents and it was on, at around the halfway mark - "Hello," I thought, "even though I've never seen this before, it looks unmistakeably like Irwin Allen."
Franciscus gets the Richard Chamberlain role, Veronica Hamel the Susan Blakely neglected wife part, Jacqueline Bisset the Faye Dunaway girlfriend duties, and Red Buttons the Fred Astaire role as embezzler Francis Fendly (great character names abound here), though instead of a romance with Jennifer Jones he gets saddled with Borgnine's New York cop.
Somehow, he is able to see that eruption is imminent, even though the head of the lab, John Webster (John Considine), doesn't.
The plot is pretty wacky, though it could have made for an enjoyably ludicrous film if handled with a bit more verve (see The Lost Continent for a film which had an outrageous storyline, but worked OK because the makers had the courage to stand by their own absurdities).
Also, this director has a great cast of actors and yet they still end up sucking (though I personally don't blame the actors, I blame the director).
Kris Marshall is particularly unconvincing and looks uncomfortable in the role, even though this is the second series.
The story makes no sense even though its very obviously inspired (stolen) by other famous movies and uses the same clichÃ©s all over again.
I had an attack of the giggles part way through the movie, and it worsened with the ludicrous plot developments, culminating in a full-fledged laughing attack when the Tibetan monk at the end spoke so badly they had to subtitle him... even though he was attempting to speak English.
Peter MacNichol, though, makes the perfect Renfield Â for ANY Dracula film, serious or spoof - and is the only actor who truly nails his role in this blunt-toothed parody.
Leslie Nielsen is not quite up to his usual Frank Drebin deadpan comedy routines, and even though Peter MacNicol delivers a note perfect Dwight Frye (Renfield in the 1931 version), as well as good turns from Harvey Korman and Brooks himself, the final result is depressingly unfunny.
Hilarious stake-through-the-heart scene, though!
though sebastian niemann tries hard to give it a personal touch, he canÂ´t overcome the ill-fated premise of the muddled script.
Supposedly based on this Paganini document, the band produce a new (and equally awful) song, and decide to make a video-clip in Paganini's old mansion - The mansion in which the famous violin virtuoso had once signed a pact with the devil... Sound cheesy, and it is, but not only is it very, very dumb cheese, even though the film is only 80 minutes long, the temptation to fast-forward becomes bigger with each passing minute after a while.
Even though this movie was shot rather recent - in 1989 - it looks incredibly dated and above all cheap !!
The script seemed to have been written on a chalkboard - interchanging cliche after cliche though lacking a satirical or retroactive temperament.
Gooding visits him in prison to try to find out what happened even though it's none of his business.
(Even though it has no idea what it's doing.)
When I first turned on the movie I though it was gonna be horrible,and not to my surprise it was horrible.
Have no fear, though, as said there's plenty of other 80's trash featuring Linda Blair out there.
The guy playing the teenage brother of one of the main female characters looks as though he'd rather be somewhere else.
Just when it feels as though we are going to learn something, the plot becomes more confusing.
I must admit though, that the eye puncturing scene was the highlight of the film.
with stars in her eyes, though the sex never happens because this is hermetically-sealed 1956 and, of course, people didn't do such things.
Joseph Campanella and the rest of the earthbound actors do a great job in this one; their performances are not done justice with such a silly ending though.
There is no plot line, no events that will lead them to even change their views of each other at this point of time(half the movie gone)and seriously, there are such little chemistry or sexual tension between the two leads that I for one, even though knowing that this is to come, still can't quite imagine them falling for each other.
The impossibly cute Elisabeth Harnois is engaging as the First Daughter, but Will Friedle is stuck once again playing another dumb character, though he's not nearly as moronic and annoying as in his "Boy Meets World" role.
i guess i just like it for a rainy day even though i only watch it like once a year.
Michael Shanks does a really good job as Jackson though taking over from James Spader.
The acting is alright, to be honest everyone just got on my nerves though.
This future, though, is not supposed to be a pleasant world, so the characters and what they have to sing about reflect this devastated society.
Part 3 was decent, as was part 4, even though it had absolutely NOTHING to do with The Gods Must Be Crazy, except that it was crazy for them to associate it to the series.
The MIB leans down and authoritatively asks the lad questions, and though they are surrounded by dozens and dozens of people, no one seems to notice a man in a black suit and black sunglasses and a black fedora harassing a child in the schoolyard.
Eventually the MIB are driven back and the family escapes, though they are doomed to walk the earth in terror knowing that any Chevy celebrity might be the end of them all.
The six main characters who spend the weekend in this country home spend a lot of time talking about their feelings, though one has a hard time believing that any of them actually have real feelings.
Howard (Denholm Elliott) loves Lane, who loves Peter (Sam Waterston), who has a thing for Stephanie (Diane Wiest), who is married but returns Peter's feelings even though she knows that she is betraying Lane, blah, blah, blah.
Meanwhile Diane loves only Diane, even though she is partnered with Lloyd (Jack Warden), a melancholy physicist who is depressed over how utterly meaningless existence is.
They might as well be discussing their income tax returns, though that would probably inspire much more enthusiasm.
It's not really all that bad though and it does have several quirky and interesting ideas; the suspicious pair discussing dead bodies who turn out to be archaeologists, the deaf-mute killer who talks in sign-language, a bomb in a party-cracker, Holmes' ingenious dupe for hiding the king, and so on.
All though it is long (four hours with commercials) it is worth watching every moment of it over and over again.
If you've seen Friday the 13th, Sleepaway Camp or Halloween you know what's going to happen and pretty much who will be left at the end, though they added a slight twist to keep you awake.
The film is thankfully short, though (not counting the closing song, it runs about 73 minutes).
Overall though unless you are a fan of hers avoid this as it is very routine.
There is, though, one reason to check this out during one of the 1,265 times that Sci-Fi will re-air it over the next 5 months: 'The Dance' scene must be witnessed to be believed.
Elwood attempted to ditch the kid, though unsuccessfully, and seek out Curtis' son.
The plot, about a vaudeville mother trying to turn her rich carefree son into a responsible one with him unaware of who she is, is for the birds and doesn't have many funny scenes though I did like Peter's celebrity impersonations and his dance with Hall in drag.
Rubin, however, is all over the place with his confusion of the American vernacular of the time and almost everything concerning him makes no sense whatsoever (though I did like his funny dance).
RICHARD BURTON gets to tear the scenery to pieces as DOCTOR FAUSTUS, directing himself into a frenzy of stylized theatrical acting as though he didn't know the camera would magnify his every over-sized movement.
It's all done up in garish Technicolor with sets that look as though the low budget was put to efficient use.
This is for sure though: there's a girl, this guy kills girls and turns them into dolls, and the dolls come to life.
The girl then shakes her head in dismay, even though she wanted her brother to save her in the first place.
The film is reminiscent of the "mondo" films of the era, and with the "strong" torture scenes, it also sorta reminded me of MEN BEHIND THE SUN - though not nearly as powerful or interesting.
Even though Idalia can act, its a wrong casting choice IMHO.
I was not sure of the motivation, though I was sure of the who was responsible and the identity.
Somewhat predictable -- you can pretty much figure out which character will "surprisingly" reveal themselves as gay, or guess that ***SPOILER ALERT*** BADASSSSS is going to pull in the crowds at the last minute****   It's a shame, though, because the acting in this film is really REALLY good.
Sellers is reasonably good, though he tends to rely too much on the vocal tics that were his Achilles heel throughout his career.
Worth seeing for sci-fi fans, though most others probably won't be that impressed today.
Even though it looks like a tiny toy tank, it manages to run over the stomach of a 7 foot Russian astronaut, thus giving the petite female surgeon excuse to undress the heroic male and operate on him to save his vitals (sorry, not shown!).
There is one humorous idea though that stands out.
On the flip side, the movie assembles an impressive, though no name international cast, including Asians, a black, a Russian and a German.
Seven men and one woman from the scientific community form the astronaut team, though why Sumiko is given a bright red jumpsuit to wear instead of the same color as the men is intriguing.
They are in good company though.
I think there is a serious side to this movie though and it is summed up neatly in Elwood's inspirational speech when he reminds his rebellious band members what society will be left with if real musicians give up making music.
I would have liked the rape scenes to be more graphic (not the one with the goat though).
it is a sexist film, though you cant help but drool over the outfits (well as a girl I couldnt help, lol) but you do think were some of them really needed!!!
It could be worse, though - "Charlie's Angels 3: One Last Job"
even on it's own, the woods was a pretty satisfying horror movie: it was dark, the dialogue doesn't pain my ears, and the ending totally doesn't suck (though i'm not too sure how it made sense [?]
still good though), and there weren't any bad performances!
By the first 10 minutes, though, you wish they would just get it over with.
This man has to be on the FBI's "priority watch" list(s)...the girls WERE hot though...
Who though of Robson's gum transplant?
One of them is forced to go to Earth, though they admit they've been "quite racists" towards the earthlings.
do not see it even though it is free.do not waste your time with this.the age limit must be +18 for this silly show.if you don't have psychological problems,you can not laugh any of the jokes.
The whole thing is really a tribute to Shatner's massive ego- though, to be fair, he does seem to have a sense of humour about the whole thing.
This can become a distraction for fans who are very familiar with "Suspiria" though McKee gives it enough of a spin for the film to not look like a lame rip off and more like an inspired "let's do it like in the good old days" romp.
The film has some pacing problems, though, most of which are linked to the heavy foreshadowing.
The finale is a bit of a let down, though, even if the involvement of the titular woods is fun to see (thanks also to some convincing CGI, not the second-rate crap that often destroys the atmosphere in these small-budgeted movies).
It's pretty much by the numbers, though it is enormous fun to see Bruce "Don't Call Me Ash" Campbell wield an axe and split some witch bitch open.
Throughout the movie, it seems as though everyone's being taped (thus, the title) - but to no end, since the tapes really end up playing no role whatsoever.
The real star of the film, though, is the main actress whose name I sadly am not acquainted with.
None stood out as poor, though none were nearly as striking as the main actress.
With one or two exceptions, Raf Vallone and Michael Caine (though far from his best) the acting was disgraceful.
Any movie in this genre needs an ending or else it makes the viewer, at least this viewer, feel as though they just wasted two hours of their life.
It's a good idea for an ending, but is executed as though it were in front of a blind firing squad.
Seriously though, a lack of "good-looking females" shouldn't be considered an essential to a movie.
Even though some of the twists seem unnecessary, I thought many were brilliant and I kept trying to will myself to care about it, to care about them, but I didn't.
The reason this deserves a 3, is because I did enjoy some of the songs (which were spread out, making us wait through nonsensical sub-plots), and even though it was totally random, some of the daydreams amused me.
Badly filmed, badly lit, badly staged, badly acted, badly edited and badly scripted (by McCartney, it must be said, though I can understand his insistence that the whole thing was improvised - I sure wouldn't want to take any credit for this fiasco unless someone held a gun to my temple), this fifty minute splurge of drug-fuelled self-indulgent excess takes a lot of patience to sit through, even if you're a Beatles fan.
This film needed more odd side characters and more Angela Bettis she was the voice of the woods though and that and the 60s settings along with Bruce Campbell and Patricia Clarkson's performances made this worthwhile from my viewpoint, I liked the pacing and effects and the bed in the corner had creepy possibilities that were misused by the writer.
It seems as though EVERY new Christmas movie that comes out is listed as an "Instant Classic" and this is no different.
The songs are simple and, even though the Paul and Linda McCartney hit "Wonderful Christmas Time" is listed as one of them, it is only a small snip-it version of perhaps 30 seconds.
Overall, it's a sad commentary on the lack of originality and quality of the film when the likes of Monroe, Gaynor and especially O'Connor can't even save it, even though individually and collectively they do have their moments; the problem is those moments are just too few and far between.
The scenes with the girls waving with axes are bloodstunning though.
It jumps from idea to idea (and even though to thought), hoping to grip onto something that sticks.
I'm starting to think there's a greater chance of aliens landing in Manhattan though.
When you make a film with such disregard for quality though, you can't do anything to convince me that you actually care about what you're trying to say.
I will give Hollywood this though; they have finally found the perfect vehicle for the now- veteran Hollywood actor, Keanu Reeves.
Honestly though, this is the first time I can say that Reeves's presence in a film has absolutely nothing to do with why it is unwatchable.
Klaatu certainly rocks that three-piece suit though.
Perhaps the most important lesson though is that humanity will never learn.
I am the bride of Jesus", which just cracked me up, even though I think it was supposed to be a serious moment.
It is not all bad though.
The acting was average to say the least, though Jennifer Aniston's presence shows and keeps one watching.
The ending though is something pretty incredible.
Even though part two came out five years after the original, we're supposed to not notice that the actors look a lot older and wear their hair in completely different styles.
"Triple Cross" is one of the movies Terence Young wished he'd never done, and it is bad indeed, even though it had all the ingredients a good box office hit needs: an international all-star cast (Christopher Plummer, Romy Schneider, Yul Brynner, Trevor Howard, Gert FrÃ¶be, Jess Hahn, Claudine Auger from "Thunderball", Howard Vernon and Bernard Fresson), a massive budget, a director at the height of his international fame, a Bond-like story, a Bond-like score (Georges Garvarentz) and Bond-like locations (Jersey, London, Paris, Lisbon, Southern France).
The lead, Jacqueline Dupre', is quite lovely as well (though I personally preferred Laennec) and, like her predecessor, this was her only movie to date.
What with his bloated features and ill-fitting helmet, he doesn't look as though he will even survive the parachute jump.
As I stated above, the quality is bad, though some of the acting is decent, and however they trained the sea lion is pretty impressive though.
Ginger plays a radio star who is portrayed as so saccharine that it's impossible to believe that the public could stand her, though according to the film she's America's Sweetheart!
I agree, though, with the film's depiction of The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005.
More likely, though they would just raise the minimum age for getting a credit or regulating the credit limits available to low income people, or something like that.
So the film seemed ignorant on that point too, though I would accept correction on that point.
It gives the film a lot more credibility, though Vernon was close to the end of his career by 1988.
It's neither funny nor dramatic, neither fish nor fowl, though it does smell.
The paper-thin story has Detective Bullitt trying to determine how a Mob informant in Police custody managed to be killed (he's not actually killed until about an hour later though).
The occasional good moments and the reason why I don't give it an even lower rating happen thanks to the narration and an inspired, brief black-and-white footage from the 60's, the great soundtrack, plus Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro's performances (even though I could never relate to their characters, they fitted them perfectly).
Not sure how they though any part of this would be scary e.g.
'The Dead Next Door' is completely devoid of anything seriously positive, though.
I jest of course, seriously though, all of these willing unknowns do try, and seemingly give their best, and granted the somewhat underdeveloped threadbare script to work with, I think in most case's make up for general lack of natural talent with more gumption and enthusiasm.
i know that the budget was modest but $80.000 is what it cost sam raimi to make the evil dead (though tatty - a real classic) and he rented proper equipment and had some decent actors, and also showed some directorial flair.
It's hard to really hate the film, because you know it means well....but that doesn't mean that you won't be looking at your watch frequently, even though it runs only 80 minutes.
This movie can claim to be a low, low budget gore movie without any attempt to actually any talent even though it thinks it has.
Michael O'Keefe had sex with a minor, even though he had children himself.
Things are not that groovy, though, as the youngest members of society are left to fend for themselves and, within them, dissatisfaction begins to build and then the movie ends.
Instead of a serious message, though, it just seems overblown, ponderous and dopey,...as well as funny from time to time.
Well first the acting isn't very good though, this isn't very surprising.
Judi Dench did the best job out of everyone else though she isn't in the film for a long time.
The main problem with this film, though, is the misleading title.
The idea, though very controversial, is unusual and could have been done well...but this film wasn't done all that well.
"Revelation" though isn't just a millenial thriller.
You might be surprised when I point out that Carter never fought Griffith for a world championship in 1963 though he did fight for the middlewight championship a year later against champion Joey Giardello who beat him on points with plenty to spare .
Thankfully justice is served though be it belatedly when a bunch of Canadians expose this terrible miscarriage of justice and Rubin is set free .
People felt sorry for him, even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society.
Even though they are the heroes of this movie, justice must be done, and the girls are thrown back behind bars.
The best part of the film though, are a few of the female leads.
What is disappointing though is that the film could very easily have been much better if the writers had decided to just rehash the first film.
As for technical, I can assure you Europeans that the English dub is equally as bad, though one can tell that indeed the characters' mouths were animated for English.
I thought she was a neat character, though a bit over-acted.
Set in an anonymous rural America (though it's swamp setting seems to illuminate that this is either in or nearby southern Louisiana), we first meet it's sort-of hero Nat (Lucas Black) as he's just being released from a mental institution, headed towards Wyoming to become a sheep farmer (or something like that).
That night, however, he's involved in a violent barroom brawl with some pinhead regulars, though by the end of the altercation he is able to swipe the keys from one of their swanky new vehicles.
After the car dies down on a sheep-infested road, he meets a local hotel owner Finch (Peter Coyote) who's car has just been flipped over, though leaving nary a physical scratch or a speck of dust on his slick, white-bullet of a suit (which precisely sums up his personality).
"Deepwater" occasionally shows some visual promise (though the deafening score and hazy rapid-zoom through a supposedly drugged-out forest during the starting credits instantly concludes that this is going to be quite unwatchable), as the moss-green and vibrant navy blue color schemes occasionally create a vivid, believable atmosphere of swampside congestion and fear.
I kept it on though so I could get a good laugh.
None of the torpedoes hit the sub, even though no decoys are fired, and yet the sub still takes hits.
And, the crew seems to die rather quickly from the virus, though the villain, Kretz has a vile of it crammed in his mouth and survives for a very long time.
There is one saving grace though, after watching the performances in this stinker, you'll be appreciating the master thespianism that is one Jean Claude Van Damme.
This is a cult movie alright, although I'm pretty alone being a cultist here, this movie has all the elements of an ugly movie of the 70s (though i hear its huge in Australia).
This movie might be OK to see if you had smoked some wicked herb or taken some acid, though because i hadnt it just made me angry.
Daughter of famous WW 2 novelist (James Jones, though not called by that name), grows up in Paris and matures in 70s USA.
Luckily, though, the classmates she despises the most are involved with the website in some random way or another, and she's able to basically use momentum to find the badguy at the end.
The lack of yo-yo action left me feeling a little ripped off, though.
It's easy to hate everything else, though.
and even though none of the fighting in this film is too well done, the setups are creative, and the grittyness of them helps make them entertaining.
Dharmesh Darshan after melodramatic messes like BEWAFAA returns with AAP KE KHATIR a remake of A WEDDING DATE  The film also reminds of PYAAR TO HONA HI THA(FRENCH KISS remake) which was tad better  This film tries hard to look like a modern love story but falls flat The first half focuses on comedy scenes which are too in your face, the scenes between Akshaye and Priyanka too are awful especially their sudden love angle  The director suddenly forces the drama in second half and Punjabi stuff which is bad and the sudden Dino-Amisha angle is forced  Direction is bad Music is saving grace  Akshaye Khanna looks bored and though better then the rest yet he got typecast in such roles Priyanka overacts badly initially but is good towards the end Dino is okay, Suneil is horrible Amisha is bad Anupam and Lilette irritate and so the guju family
I will give credit though to Pembroke's military ally Eli Sampson (Bud Spencer), he got an awful lot of mileage out of the old, hey the War is over gimmick.
Seriously though a must-miss unless you want a textbook example of how NOT to do a horror film.
Nothing in this movie is wasted, and though it is low-budget, it is an awesome film, every Chinese film fan I know love it, and I am no exception.
But that doesn't excuse scenes where the boom-mike thrusts itself into view or we can see daylight through the windows, though it is supposed to be night.
Whatever else you might think though, there is some very imaginative premises here which I can only guess how the writer came up with.
Ultimately though, this is one for those long winter evenings when you're drunk and can't get upstairs.
As it stands, though, you won't be doing yourself any favors by watching this piece of crud.
Even though disappointing, however, "The Monster Club" is still worth checking out for its superb cast.
The second story, a slapstick vampire story which is actually a film in the film, is the worst of the three, very simple and even more silly, even though it is this one which stars both Donald Pleasence and Britt Ekland.
Marc Anthony captured Lavoe's on stage mannerisms perfectly, and even though I would have preferred to hear actual Lavoe recordings, he did sing well.
I did look forward to his scenes, though which gave me some excitement.
who CARES?.....and though I have no problems with sex scenes in a movie(as long as there is a reason for it) what was the point of this film to have a minor one....except to "just film a sex scene"...yeah, really original...If you like a story that goes ABSOLUTLEY NOWHERE, then CHASING SLEEP is for you....
In fact, at times it seemed as though she was in a different movie since she was so laid back and sane and the characters around her were so over the top and cartoonish.
The Imp is the most annoying character even though he is supposed to be the most lovable.
Enough of that though I have a movie to review.
Even though the plot was not a complex one, the different character relationships, whether between the pilots themselves, or of the perceived triangle of Taylor, Hussey and Pidgeon, was sensitively handled, and the several tricky maneuvers demanded of the pilots kept me glued to the screen.
Why, we're not really told though I assume it's for the furtherance of science.
It truly is terrible, watching the fight scenes prove this undeniably, but the acting isn't always grade z, though it is so stereotypical you'll want to throw your head back and laugh.
I was also furious at Lady Bertram's opium addiction, at Mary Crawford's hints at lesbian tendencies, at Sir Thomas Bertram's motives and dealings in Antigua, and the complete unnecessary, though brief, nude scene with Maria Bertram and Henry Crawford.
Additionally, Spock's character is very nicely examined, the developing rivalry and friendship between McCoy and Spock is enhanced, and the powerful - though unresolved - relationship between Christine Chapel and Spock begins.
It's the only cute thing in the movie, even though it is all about her unsuccessful attempts at controlling the weather.
At one point, Scowl the Owl raps about how bad he is, and though I agree about the bad part, this song is torture to listen to.
Even worse than the chintzy animation though is the writing.
Even though the part was very brief, only as a corpse, he seemed to put every actor's effort into the part.
Some scenes look as though they were shot twice or even three times Â and all the shots are included in the film, so its like some horrible demonic rewind button that forces you to see everything multiple times.
The movie itself though is so terrible it's amazing that it was ever released.
Donald Gibb shows up to reprise his role, even though he's play a different character.
Still it's an alright movie for martial arts fan though.
For a crap movie, though, the effects are pretty good.
I think Sajid Khan needs to see Bheja Fry to understand that by doing stupid actions and creating childish situation, you cannot make someone laugh (though there will be people who will enjoy it).
The movie does have a few bright moments though, mostly in Jane's visions and comments to them.
The "stoner", though unreliable at times and high the rest of time, is generally quite likable.
And though I didn't like Knocked Up, it definitely was better than this.
Despite the title, this isn't a horror film at all; the werewolf elements are only introduced three-quarters of the way in Â which are, in any case, merely suggested through the lead character's hallucinations Â but these obviously constitute the film's highlight (though rugged, pasty-faced star and co-director Chesebro isn't exactly Lon Chaney Jr.); still, the transformation-by-transfusion is an interesting concept, one which I don't think has been done in subsequent films.
I will make this promise though if you don't cry at the movie you will most definitely find this movie upsetting and sad and you may most likely cry.
Soon, though, Sandler discovers that the remote may actually be a wolf in sheep's clothing.
From an acting perspective, Sandler is surprisingly strong, though nothing that would gain him much more respect after turning in good performances in Punch Drunk Love and Spanglish.
Beckinsale is definitely strong, though it is far from career defining work.
It isn't hard to mistake Sandler for a sixty year old near the end of the cycle, though the same effect isn't as noticeable on Beckinsale or Astin.
Talk about a knock out cover though.
It's not a horror movie, though it's full of gory scenes, and it's not a horror comedy, 'cause there's nothing funny in it.
CatonÂJones will not raise above the level of his own BASIC INSTINCT 2 and THE JACKALÂstarÂvehicles, essentially derivative and exploitative; only that CITY BY THE SEA is below those, and yet another wasting of a De Niro performance (--though CatonÂJones is not alone to blameÂas De Niro himself looks rather uncooperative--).
The 'wonder' and awe is not there... even though you're led up to the wall and bashed into it at the end.
The bestseller "Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil" was a non-fiction book and though it dealt with a true life murder case, it was shelved in the travel section in many bookstores.
Devoid of local color or a quixotic taste for the off beat and amusing, MIDNIGHT ends up playing as though it were an uninspired pilot for an unsold TV series.
Of the two sequels, "My Summer Story" was much better, though neither could ever be better than the first.
Frankly though, I have wasted too much time on this pathetic, stupid, meaningless and unredeemable movie.
Smells like the old West, though.
After this atrocity, folks continue to wander the streets, go in and out of stores, and continue their daily lives as though nothing has happened.
Whether it be the above examples, or Peter Fonda being shot in the stomach, at close range, having the bullet removed, and then immediately riding out into the desert on horseback as though nothing had ever happened to him, much of this film is just plain ludicrous!
Lesley Warren works herself into a real tizzy worrying that new hubby Ryan O'Neal won't be able to protect them from crazy Peter Haskell, though apparently Ryan has been working out at the gym behind her back (resulting in an evening street brawl which fails to raise any concern from the neighbors).
The ending of the film, even though it's a bit downbeat, was just what the film needed when you realize that dreams are best kept to oneself and in their right place.
However, if you are looking to torture yourself and/or others, then check this movie out...it's something that you'll never forget, though more than likely you'll wish you could.
Jody never tells the police that her stepfather abuses her - even though she has the bruises to prove it.
Rigg is far too old and worldly for the dopey Helena, and Derek Godfrey's Theseus seems more like a baron in some Russian novel (though admittedly I kept getting distracted by his helmet-head bouffant).
For all but a die-hard fan of any of the regulars or of Shakespeare's work, though, this film is a pass.
Kristin Scott Thomas (a major reason I rented this) is underused, though as effective as they allowed her to be.
Mortal Kombat was pretty good (hated the PG-13 rating though).
I admit though, some elements did take place, but couldn't make up for the movie as a whole.
The editing was horrible though.
Trivia: Lance was in Aliens (an actual GOOD movie by James Cameron) and Alien 3 (a bit of a fail, though) He eventually wins because it turns out he was a "good" guy helping (WTF?!)
The Alien-queen is blown up, even though she's already been blown up FOUR F-CKING TIMES!!!!
The execution wasn't very good though since its just not very exciting.
The films running time of 102 minutes feels a lot longer though.
What's worse, though, is the presence of good actors such as Gabriel Byrne.
The acting was bad as well... almost as though he was reading everything off a teleprompter.
Devlin   I don't know why, but even though Devlin was a bit part, his self-righteousness was annoying.
Overall, though, the movie was a disappointment.
And, worse - it treats its audience as though it has no sense of logic or reason.
It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie.
It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie.
It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie.
It also uses repetition constantly though out the movie.
Even though Fact or Fiction is supposed to only be a cable access show, the material is done poorly and the actors are unconvincing.
Even though the twist made little sense to me, the style of the film at that point, which pulled further away from the feigned documentary, worked better for me.
It seems that the filmmakers felt, in spite of the bad critical reception of the first Blue Lagoon, that an exotic island and two teenagers discovering sex and then fornicating (though we see none of that) was enough to create an entertaining film.
But other than that, Lilli (Milla Jovovich) and Richard (Brian Krause) go through the same motions as Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins as though they were destined to live the exact same lives as the previous couple on the island.
It has gorgeous pictures of a tropical paradise, far better acting, and you won't feel dirty and guilty by the end of the film because the actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato, were both in their thirties (though they look like in the their twenties) at the time of filming.
Some great actors got their start though because of this film.
There are a few things I enjoy about this film though.
I won't give anything away though, because the plot will reveal itself immediately.
You need to know this, though: the movie was written by Mike White.
I saw this for the first time recently, and simply had to comment even though the film is a few years old.
Perhaps it's time to leave the poor old Frankenstein monster alone, this version brings nothing really new to the genre even though I'm sure the director thought he was being revisionist.
Edward Arnold gives his familiar robust, take-charge performance (see the 1937 screwball comedy EASY LIVING and the previous year's COME AND GET IT which this film resembles in theme and plot); Grant and Oakie are pretty much themselves as well, though the full impact of Grant's screen charisma is blunted in this non-comic role.
Well, even though it was relatively early in his career, he had plenty of charisma and star status that it just didn't make sense having him play second to Edward Arnold--who played an annoying and ridiculous version of the life of Jim Fisk.
The kids know what's going on though, 'cause they've seen the invader eating live chickens in the barn.
This uneasy, uncertain mix of brutal murder sequences (though the effects don't stand up to scrutiny) and a spoofy tone is a complete waste of time.
It didn't seem QUITE as bad, even though it's generally considered inferior to its predecessor.
In fact, call me crazy, but I found that some parts weren't too bad at all, though I wouldn't say I exactly enjoyed the movie.
Even though we get the big three of power rangers I mean everyone knows these guys Jason (the compassionate leader) Kimberly (The heart of the team and she's pretty damn hot) and Tommy (the favorite and pretty boy of the group) the character development well face it there was none plummets this from movie to one overlong action kiddie show.
I am probably one of the minority of intelligent teens who liked the first movie (even though I have just turned 18).
All though I liked Power Rangers in Space but the following Power Rangers series like Lost Galaxy,Light Speed Rescue,Time Force,Ninja Storm,Wild Force,Dino Force and S.P.D.
They then assume that all the sand is dry, even though it is wet just below the surface.
I don't mean to belabor this point though, as you'll probably hear less than 20 seconds of the stuff; but in a movie in which the combined dialogue runs for 5-10 minutes, it's something to think about.
It's not a boring film, it's a confusing and unsettling and emotionally unavailable film, even though the entire presentation of the plot is based on the emotions of the leading characters.
Though the film is meant to be somewhat autobiographical, the real facts of Asia's life are far more interesting and make much more sense, though they be somewhat strange to those of us looking from the outside.
It's a mess, though, dragged down to lousy by a screenplay written by the same misguided pen of that disaster-bore-embarrassment "Kingdom Of Heaven".
An interesting plot line was strung together by an amateur, though fortunately you've got watchable actors, some wry funny lines and a few outrage scenes that pop.
Yes, Jack Nicholson is a great actor, but no he didn't convince me in the role, even though most of the good lines and deliveries were his.
Don't give up though...art is an incindiary form of annoyance for many...open discussions are the secon best part of art."
And even though the story of Orlando could have been interesting this 90 minute film seemed like it was well over 2hrs.
On the screen though a jump of that kind, with no explanation, is just confusing.
Like his music, though, there's certainly not many other things out there like this.
The writing is quite lousy... clichÃ©s are plentiful, it was drenched in naivety, predictability abounds, the story never really captivates(in spite of its title, I could easily see people falling asleep during it), even though it manages to rip off far more established sci-fi titles(including Independence Day and The Day The Earth Stood Still... the latter being from when obvious messages in this genre were at least more accepted and usual, and actually a well-produced piece of celluloid; this was simplistic, offensive... modern propaganda).
Dated though it is stylistically, we appreciate the astounding expertise of the kids who can still jam, break, lock, snap, crackle and pop it.
Even though David Hasselhoff and Emmanuel Lewis stop by for a couple of good-natured cameos, this is one fish-out-of-water tale that should probably be thrown back in the water.
the dialog was horrible, the acting was pretty damned bad, and the general premise was fairly weak (though if anything else had existed to keep this movie afloat, maybe it would have been salvageable).
This is the sort of film that irritates some of us sensitive Brits, though your reviewer didn't mind Tyrone Power being in the RAF and Humphrey Bogart being at El Alamein.
I don't think either is all that great but given the choice to watch either again, I'd take the Garbo film, even though it's always good to watch Astaire and Charisse stepping out, so to speak.
The acting is perfunctory, though we have to say that Lee J. Cobb is a good psychiatrist.
Robert Rodriguez writes and directs the film's best part, though that's not saying a whole lot.
I don't think I could take the risk though.
I never though that the creator of Kill Bill could be in such garbage.
As though Mr. Bean wasn't tiresome enough, this film puts Tim Roth into a role with the same sort of inane physical comedy, and it is painful to watch.
Wasnt worth the 14 dollars though.
Rula Lenska shows talent by managing to pull off a passable appearance given the dire lack of material she is given to work with, but Ron Moody looks as though he only turned up to collect the pay cheque and Lee Blakemore as Kim makes Metal Mickey look like Lawrence Olivier.
Nielsen hasn't been in any descent stuff recently though.
I want that to change though since hes outstanding and very underrated.
Keaton's uncontained exuberance here may have lead to his getting the title role in BEETLEJUICE (1988) but nonetheless comes across as essentially overstated; Winkler though, miles away from his iconic and ultra-confident Fonzie character, is wonderful and he is matched by Shelley Long (of CHEERS fame, hence another established TV performer trying to break into movies) as the call-girl abused by customers (after her pimp is flamboyantly 'executed') who seeks comfort in the arms of neighbor Winkler (himself engaged to a neurotic woman dominated by strict parents).
If you like Austin Powers, you will probably like this, even though it is not as popular.
Time and time again these girls absolutely refuse to leave the house even though there is a driller killer on the loose and they are "afraid" for their lives.
The acting was right on target for the genre though--reeeeeally bad.
The acting is decent compared to other horror slashers, though it was pretty bad in some parts.
And we've all seen the standard electrocuted-in-bathtub death scene countless times before, scene, though instead of the usual hair dryer or radio being tossed in the tub, this time it's caused by a vibrator that one character plugs in and leaves sitting on the sink while she's taking a bath.
ten times stronger than the strongest earthquake; it's more like a million times stronger, 3) It's impossible to redirect a meteor when it's only days away from impact (again, nit-picking, or maybe they didn't know that then - though I doubt that), 4) it isn't possible to destroy a meteor that big (and that fast) with a series of nuclear hits, 5) One of the space centers only discover a big one going towards NY when it's just minutes away from impact!
I doubt Moore could have played Bond though if that happened.
Idiocy is rife throughout, from Drax's comical henchmen notably Jaws (who was menacing in The Spy Who Loved Me) to Space shuttles that blast off at a moments notice as though it's as easy as taking off in a Cessna.
I understand why it was noticed in America, though.
However, there are other instances when it looks as though the movie is being acted out by a bunch of friends in a warehouse or derelict flat.
The Left will cheer it to high heavens, even though it is neither a good film, nor an unbiased representation of facts.
If everyone would watch this movie, take a second to think about what they feel, and then take out of it the message that rings true to them, this movie will have had the effect a journalistic piece should have, even though I doubt that is the effect it was aiming at.
Even though it is a sci-fi/horror flick, we in the audience aren't retarded.
In the end though, trough the nagging of her aged father and the boring intervention techniques from her equally boring boyfriend she is swayed to abandon her hobo-hedonistic lifestyle and yielded to the white-collar work-ethics all scientists obey (except she isn't motivated by monomaniacal self-important worship of math and greed of course)  Though plaid-shirt wearing math-monkeys feel the sand of human ignorance towards their exalted science grinding in the neat little clock-works of their pedestrian brains, so too my pop-culture filled remnant of gray matter is vexed by the blatant disrespect for human reality , or at least my reality; I never met an interesting mathematician.
A good premise ruined by a simplistic, soap-opera script, weak supporting performances (though Angelina Jolie is, as has been noted, quite good), and low production values, this story of the lives of women helping to settle the West never quite gels.
Not this time, though.
Even though John Steed and Emma Peel are supposed to be meeting for the first time as this picture begins, it is assumed that we viewers know the characters and everything about them already, so the action begins without any delay.
i don't totally feel they are to blame though.
Most of the time, though, he spouts about wanting a ransom in exchange for decent weather in England (like English people are so used to decent weather rain and snow would bother them - has the writer ever set foot in this country???)
The writers put way too much humor into the movie though.
I'm sure people who have worked in the restaurant business might be able to relate to this film more, though I have worked in the customer service business before and I know how it is to deal with difficult people.
In the grim harshness of reality though (!?
The old lady ought to be put in a home though the son was good for a few chuckles.
It's not as though anime has to be along the lines of Fist Of The North Star for me to enjoy it.
Thank god for Priyanka though.
Even though it had some decent actors, they all did a terrible job or were given a terrible script and direction in this flick.
The real question, though, is not how they will handle this situationÂbut, why should we really want to see it?
Gary, especially, is despicable for the majority of the movie and Brooke, though the only main character with which we can sympathize, does her fair share of mean things.
I will tell you what I thought of 'Break Up', though: a true and real BORE.
We though "The Breakup" was going to be a comedy... it was a tragic pile of interpersonal failure...
For would-be or wannabe soldiers it might be a nice movie, though.
Kirk, always the first to kill a god (see the awful STAR TREK V movie and the "Val" episode for more about this), orders a sexy crew member to refuse Apollo's love in order to tick him off--even though she really does think the guy is pretty buff and sweet.
This feels like a sell out film and I think a wee bit egotistical to put himself as an important though not central character instead of his usual cameo appearance.
The followup documentary reuniting some of the survivors is an exquisitely touching finale, though wouldn't it be lovely to continue the series, chronicling the gap between then and now.
Only after drinking milk and pissing your pants, though.
In fact, I hadn't even registered at the site even though I have visited it regularly for years.
In this one, though, the subject is so outlandish that even the prodding the movie gives itself can't make it forgivable.
what's weirder than that though, is how readily the building tenants accept all this nonsense, and how much they try to help instead of calling the Loony Police on Giamatti and Howard's characters.
The followup documentary reuniting some of the survivors is an exquisitely touching finale, though wouldn't it be lovely to continue the series, chronicling the gap between then and now.
But though Leaphorn knew about it all, he didn't live it in the mystical sense, not being particularly religious himself.
Probably the creepiest aspect of all this was that Bruce's son, Brandon, also died prematurely while filming THE CROW and the studio did pretty much the same trick (though with modern computer techniques it did look better).
The fight scenes at the end are 10/10 though, just a shame they did not have all the original footage until recently e.g.
I do wonder though what they could do with todays special effects and computer graphics?
Predictably, it doesn't take our hero long to meet, greet, and get sweet with cattle queen Maria Singleton (Alexis Smith of "San Antonio"), even though she is engaged to marry rancher Rod Ackroyd.
Standard stalk and slash picture, yet well acted and directed, thus making it oddly interesting and watchable, though the violence isn't for the squeamish (especially the director's cut which was originally given an "NC-17" rating).
There is one scene that is constructed and shot in such a way that it could resemble a sex scene in a film even though it's not.
At this point The 13th Warrior becomes a sort of a Viking "Seven Samauri," with our Viking heroes gathering the village people (the serfs, not the disco group, though if *those* Village People appeared it would not have surprised me) to defend the town against a band of cannibals who are (again) never fully explained.
Also, just before a big battle, Ahmet suddenly drops to his knees to pray as Muslins do five times a day (though we never see him do it at any other time).
in the early '80's, and even though I was still kind of young, I thought it was awful.
Jimmy got the sh*t end of the stick, in the money he robbed, even though he was the one who put his a** on the line doing the robberies and at the same taking an eager, looking for both action and excitement, Sally along with him on his crime spree.
For the most part the acting is pretty bad and the lighting on some scenes is so horrible that you can barely tell what's going on(this may have just been the age of the movie, though).
Detective Hanahan (Joe Devlin) has the right idea, though, and suspects that local hood Nick Gordon (Jon Dawson) and his moll Mimi (Fifi D'Orsay) are implicated in some way in the girl's death.
However, in an effort to sneak in smut, small studios created films to shock adults when they learn about terrible social ills, though they were REALLY intended to titillate and slip adult themes past the censors!
Even though they were laughably bad, they also made money due to low production costs and because they often offered nudity, violence and sordid story lines--all in the name of education!
The acting and writing were almost universally bad, though the sequence where the judge tells off the parents of these punks actually was amazingly good--too bad everything else was pretty lousy.
Make sure that you have a multi-region DVD player though!
I've seen all the other St Trinians films, and the superb (and superior) forerunner The Happiest Days Of Their Lives, so I felt that I should watch the 1980 film, even though I'd read somewhere that it was poor.
All in all though, it wasn't really a good idea to make this film, and this is easily an entry that the "St. Trinian's" franchise could have done without.
Elliot Gould did M*A*S*H that same year, and built a well-deserved reputation as an excellent actor, even though he's had his cinematic ups-and-downs since then, like most actors.
Can't blame him for trying something fresh though.
Not much in the line of extras, though.
There is a bright spot though in what appears to be a young Filipino woman who performs a strip-tease in an empty nightclub for our ship's captain, and she opens a bottle of champagne using her enormous...uh...talent.
As for her... she barely thinks about him, but I guess maybe she does though all we ever see is her doing random things in Paris with other people.
Another reviewer has stated that everyone talks in ridiculous and posh accents etc and I totally agree , it`s laughable the way the Brits are portrayed in this movie though perhaps not as laughable as Tatum O`Neal`s " English " accent which is every bit as bad as Al Pacino`s " Scottish " accent in REVOLUTION .
Ultimately, though, that rage isn't in the script for her to convey.
He paints with a broad brush that even though the people working in corporations may be moral, the institution of the corporation is inherently evil.
This movie makes it seem as though corporations should be boycotted as a whole, and that is wrong.
It seems as though Michael Moore, who speaks in the movie, made it himself.
I think that they were supposed to look like several different gigs, but ended up looking as though they were different POV of the same space.
It's a shame though that the film's style doesn't match it's content Â if it had then it could have been truly affecting and memorable.
If you haven't seen this flick yet and want to (though if you do, I feel very sorry for you, my friend), you may want to skip the next sentence and read on, cause I think I may be dropping a spoiler.
From that moment on Liam knows his purpose in life, though I'm kind of glad he didn't really share it with the audience.
Even the Cockroach Monster has an apartment, though the issue is never addressed as to how he pays the rent, what bank opened a checking account for Mr. Roach, and how he signed the lease.
There are other bits & pieces that I didn't understand either like the 'dead' body Rosy shows Marvin under the drain cover at the start yet even though he takes photos of it it never mentioned or seen again, maybe I did miss something I don't know.
What it did do though is lose interest in any future projects involving him.
What is quite baffling though is that the director of this film, Craig Gillespie, had simultaneously had another release of his own in Lars and the Real Girl which contrasted in so many ways to Mr. Woodcock.
Definitely worth seeing because of the leads, though, and the music (aside from Innis' inept crooning) is worth hearing.
Susan Sarandon is almost invisible in the action of the movie, even though her relationship with Woodcock (now that's a name!)
Due to being a fan of the first Scream and having liked James Tobacks Black and White.I was keen on seeing how this film would be with both of them working together,and though it tries to be a smarter Indicent Proposal (a film that is referenced a lot during the movie)is just ends up becoming very boring and painfully slow.
It seems almost as though there was a longer, better, more interesting film here, but all of the good parts were mysteriously clipped out, leaving behind this disjointed, amateur, faux-artsy heap of rubbish.
The cars in these shots are largely Ford-Model-A-block / any-odd-freer-breathing-head, rear-drive, backyard/filling-station bombs on Ford rails rather than anything from Harry Miller's shop in nearby Vernon, though there might be an early Miller 200, 220 or 255 (the basis of the famed Leo-Goosen-designed, "Offy" 255/270 built by Offenhauser & Brisko and, later, Meyer & Drake).
Watching Melanie Griffith in Tempo though was a sad experience I could have done without.
With the charming Dean Jones and Yvette Mimieux at the center of a romantic plot this film has its moments (along with a delightful Maurice Chevalier, in what is a small role though curiously first-billed), but it is constantly derailed by the need to add monkey antics to the mix.
Finch doesn't have as much to this time around; though, she and Bunny always make a striking couple.
Many shameless and creepy split-second moments, plus a decently strange ending kept the movie "alive" throughout it's runtime, though it is difficult to ignore the shlocky and convoluted premise and over-used, rambling explanation including dead Native Americans, a soul inhabited tree, and a crazy hunter with some kind of "curse" upon him...
Overall, it has it's mildly enjoyable features, though nothing of any great necessity for horror fans...
Even though the entrance they took was very obvious and easy to detect, the next 13 years nobody enters the villa.
I will say this though, this movie didn't suck because of Adrien Brody.
The biggest problem with the story is that Ma is shown as the brains and motivating force behind the Barker gang, though most histories of the gangster era of the late 20s and early 30s completely contradict this.
What makes it interesting is that, though Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman's husband in "Casablanca" seven years earlier, was by now over the hill and reduced to B pictures, the movie is full of those naughty young girls, including the 18-year-old Rita Moreno and the 19-year-old Ann Francis.
It's not an all female cast though.
This disconnect made the movie seem not very gory, even though I guess if you bought what they were selling, it was pretty gory.
Its in Turkish though, but if you want it dubbed, just dub the Exorcist audio over the whole movie, i am sure it will fit.
Basically it's their way of saying, 'this could possibly happen, so we'll say it did happen and make people believe it happened, even though it never really did happen.'
Some inventive touch that would surpass the original, but even though every scene has a counterpart in Friedkins film, the Turkish version of the scene is always vastly inferior to the point were it's almost depressing.
He's (supposedly, though I see no evidence of it) a good singer.
Many of these movies are shown in segments that last little more than ten minutes each though there are some exceptions like this one that was shown in its one hour, seven minute entirety.
I bought the DVD for $3 (US), and I feel as though I've been ripped off...that alone should give you an idea how bad it is--and it's not the kind of bad horror movie that is so bad it's good.
Even though it's based on a true story, and an inspirational one at that I'm sure, the set-up, execution and performances play like a third-rate TV movie or half-witted high school drama.
Malcolm McDowell is (as always) great though...  2/10
I don't mind that though.
One soldier shows another soldier a war wound that he says could have gotten him discharged with 10% pay, but decided to remain in the service so that he could collect his full pay, even though he apparently hates the war and feels his country is neglecting him.
Most of all though he seems angry that when the US disbanded the Iraqi army all he was given was fifty US dollars for his years of service.
The worst part of this film though is that the tragedy that took place in Haditha is still under investigation, it is only a few years since blood was spilled there.
Collectively, though, they're a disaster.
In the Wizard Of Gore, though, Herschell Gordon Lewis reveals himself as a gore fetishist.
The scenery is really nice (even though I personally can't stand being in the north of Sweden because of all the snow and the freezing cold), but lovely nature pictures of it doesn't make up for the complete lack of anything resembling a proper plot.
I hope they had fun making it though.
Still fascinating though.
Even though its obvious that Warne knew the slasher guidelines inside out, she still breaks one of the most essential traditions of the cycle.
Certainly harmless in itself but overlong and not exactly rewarding in any way; strangely enough, the director had already tackled the story a decade earlier in GAWAIN AND THE GREEN KNIGHT (1973), which is yet another film that I haven't had the opportunity to catch up with since missing out on it on local TV in my childhood...though I can't say that I'm particularly looking forward to it now!
Granted the movie "Zardoz" was strange too, and it made no sense as well, but it had a certain style and actually seemed to work even though there are still parts of it I have no clue as to what they were about.
I must say, though, that the child artist was awesome!
This movie is a disaster from beginning to end and I justify my summary because even though it is suppose to be a terror movie there is not terror anywhere.
Heres where we get into spoilerville...  1) John is an excellent marksman, yet he manages to miss one dog randomly and hit a girls leg even though every other shot in the movie he makes is dead on.
Even though I'd missed a few things crucial to the plot, there were plenty of other elements to this film that kept me watching.
Too bad that it's senselessly penned with an messy same-old, same old structure (even though the concept showed more promise than your copy-and-paste 'Ringu' clone) of cheap jolts, typical thrills (that steals its thunder from other films) and lazily constructed characters.
I will give 'The Park' credit for two things though: More proof that clowns are evil, and the fact that we have very little (to no) character development.
That's about it, though.
Point in fact though the ending isn't horrible it just leaves a little to be desired.
He's very much the smart and likable guy, though oddly, in this film he seems to be "made of money"--throwing around money like a millionaire.
Even though they are called SIN and they operate out of a GIANT EVIL looking black TOWER.
Essentially though watchable, there's nothing really compelling to follow.
I stuck with it a little, though, and I'm really glad: Pat O'Brien is very funny as a variation on Oscar Jaffe from "Twentieth Century."
The writing is the star here, though.
There's the brash cowboy lead, the minority figure (whom I though could have been used a lot better than he was), the "religious guy", the hardened veteran ace and his nemesis (whom flies his own black-and-white aircraft so we can distinguish him from his red-colored henchmen friends) - gosh.
The ONLY thing one can take away from this is the four or five semi-respectable dogfight scenes, though the aircraft are filmed with what seems to be turbojet power aircraft and fly-by-wire control.
If you want to see a movie in which the CGI flying sequences are cluttered and unconvincing, where the hero takes no evasive action at all as the nasty guy in the black Fokker sits on his tail taking careful aim, where airplanes continuously fly through the camera, where bullets make holes as big as pie plates when they hit fabric instead of punching though it, where our hero cannot lift the fabric-covered wing off his friend's hand, where a girl learns English in two easy lessons, where the Squadron CO gives the hero a medal for disobeying a direct order, where the hero is out of uniform half the time, and where nobody at all says a damned thing worth listening to, then by all means go see "Flyboys".
Even though that doesn't sound like a recommendation, it is, for the right people.
And the bare bones of the story seems to steal a massive amount from ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA though the screenplay does remain somewhat underdeveloped   As director Paul McGuigan can also be accussed of being heavily influenced by Scorsese but that can be forgiven as the direction is the best thing about the movie with nice little flourishes like the reflection of a man falling from a high rise block of flats in a car windscreen , and there`s the aforementioned scene of a torture victim .
MacDowell is never known by a name (his character is played by two actors, the others by one), and becomes a mere cipher, though with very real, frightening power, while Frankie remains essentially himself, his image a mere show of strength, never his whole self.
The one thing that did out me off though was the fact the he was just picked up out of a bar and given a spot.
Even though the actors were good, this movie is not recommended from me.
though saddened by the fact that I had lost that chunk of my life to this travesty.
At the end of the second season there is a blues/reggae singer, a young American Idolish singer (though not of the same caliber), a ventriloquist/impressionist whose act is 99% singing, and a beat boxing singer.
Even though it is a typical boxing movie clichÃ©, there are enough twists to make it seem somewhat fresh and original.
I doubt it can be any better, though, with the same director and writer.
The group spends a lot of time bickering, and don't seem as though they should eat dinner together never mind traveling half way across the freaking world to do mushrooms.
First, off there are some pros to the film, though they are only very slight.
Good ending though!
It looked like a cute romantic comedy though and there was nothing much on other than an "Alias" repeat and a repeat of the Lifetime show "The Division" so I settled down on my bed to watch it and I was quite surprised at how good it was.
It's a little bit closer to reality (though, the chances of it happening the way it did is a bit far-fetched).
I was very fond of the characters, though.
The lack of energy from the band, though, is the coffin nail for this film.
I also believe that 60s was the best dressed decade for women (don't like pirate shirts for men, though :)) and I enjoyed the beauty of the film.
It begins with something perfectly symbolic of its theme: an Encounter Session (though you might want to fast-forward through the annoying 2-to-3 minute sequence of a car barreling up the Southern Cal hills to the strains of a truly obnoxious version of Handel's "Halleluiah Chorus" that precedes it; it's the film's only weak point).
Small point, though, in an overall great movie.
Persons with a strong curiosity about that period might find this movie interesting, even though this is by no means one of the better movies dealing with that subject matter.
Like all revolutions though, it had become (main)streamlined by movies like this, and as such was about to burn out.
Overall, though, a near-gem.
Even though I wish this film could have been a little edgier and darker in tone like the original, I do find its bold and effective use of color to be magnificent and fascinating.
Even though Victor does try to get mingled back into the life of his former love.
The documentary focuses attention on the role of former president Menem, though it definitely does not skip over other important aspects of recent Argentine history.
Great movie, though hard to watch.
Gay is an impossibility in that era and not even eluded to even though one of her friends seems ever so lesbian to me.
Worry not though, her friend who helps her dress for the loowow and listens while Gidget worries about men but says nothing, is pinned, to a guy of course.
Gidget is about worrying though.
Innocence though without some reality is simply trash.
For a moment, though, when I watch it, I step away from the sadness and vicissitudes of life as it is.
I think it is definitely better than the third one (in Rome) though.
Manmohan Desai was known for larger then life entertaining and illogical films AAA is one of them   The film marked one of Bachchan- MD most famous films and also a blockbuster  The plot is the similar long lost brothers theme but it's well handled and entertaining  The plot is revealed in the initial 20 mins itself which is damn serious but then the film gets funny and entertaining Amitabh's character is one of the best parts, Anthony Gonsalves became a big rage and is remembered even today The scenes between Amitabh- Vinod, the fight and the jail scenes are well handled(in PARVARISH surprisingly both played opposite roles of cop and thief) though the long lost theme isn't taken much further like other films(meaning the searching of the siblings.etc) but the film is more on entertainment then story  The film then focuses on love stories between Amitabh- Parveen, Rishi- Neetu.etc There are several entertaining scenes like Bachchan carrying Mukri to the hospital, Amitabh's long drunken monologue, Amitabh- Pran scene and many more There are too many songs though, like after the famous MY NAME IS ANTHONY GONSALVES in few minutes there is HUMKO TUMSE HO GAYA and PYAAR KE DUSHMAN   The film ends too in a slapstick manner with the disguises which also got famous and the long fight scene  Direction by MD is fabulous Music is good too  Amongst actors Though an esemble cast Amitabh towers above all and no doubt his character of Anthony became a rage and won him best actor award too He excelled in his character which is completely different from what Bachchan did mostly Vinod Khanna plays the cop role with elan and his last funny act is hilarious Rishi is a natural in his role and he is at his best towards the end Amongst the girls Neetu is alright, Shabana irritates, Parveen is very good Pran excels, Jeevan is as usual Hercules is okay
This all adds to the fun of them though.
There's also the songs of course, though not too many - especially in the first half of the film.
Serling returns to form, though, with 'Escape Route', the story of a Nazi war criminal (Richard Kiley) running from his brutal past.
I thought it was a bit too obvious in a way though.
The first segment is appropriately spooky; the second ingenious and unconventional (for TV); and the third, even though it is the weakest, a worthy capper on this film.
The rest is pure Serling, though, with sharply drawn characters, stylish dialogue, and his characteristic final twist of irony.
This remarkable trio of spooky stories served as a pilot to the not-quite-so remarkable TV series of the same name, though now it is just as likely remembered as the point where two screen legends passed at opposite trajectories of their careers.
It was an excellent start, though the resulting series proved to be a pale imitation of "The Twilight Zone," a peculiar hodgepodge of styles and concepts, some classics and some just plain silly.
The TV movie itself stands alone, though the trio of tales unfold in descending order.
The film often looks as though it is about to veer off into porno territory which is no surprise when you look up the Directors former and subsequent credits.
If you are, though, see it with the sound turned off and pay more attention to the backdrop than the movie itself.
Certainly not as funny though.
I felt at times though that the actors were generalising.
Before you can say Gene Autry, Powell is promoted into America's favorite singing cowboy--though he's hard pressed to prove his western skills when the plot situations demand it.
However, the acting isn't bad, and I found myself actually caring about what happened to the characters, though I think I would have enjoyed the story more if they had left out Adam's disgusting house mates.
How Brolly dies is also gross as Goku blows him up into shreds rather graphically and Paragus is crushed to death, though we are fortunately spared the gory details.
It was well acted, though to be honest I didn't think Kiera Knightley was that amazing in it, especially since she wasn't in it all the way through.
Great film though, love it to bits, one of my faves ever.
Not too bad though.
One of my all time high Anime and saying that though i have 120 anime DVDs means a lot.
The thing about it though was it was scary, just not supernaturally scary.
I thought the girl looked like Keira Knightley, I had no idea though.
Here, though this film did not break the Box Office Records of the others (including MAENNERPENSION and KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOORS), he shows us in more dimensions why he has been the phenomenon of popular German cinema this past decade, and probably beyond 2000.
Make no mistake though, this movie is an excellent tool for young budding directors how NOT to make a movie.
I remember thinking that Wing Commander 3 would have made a great movie (even though the video game was among the first video games to have a full cast of actors and sets).
Well, it probably would have, though this was not it.
Also, even though the script is week, the direction is good.
My favorite aspect of the movie, though, was how it abandons the standard "Everything is bright and pretty and technological in Sci-Fi".
One blow and the armor falls apart though, but it somehow reassembles itself, and begins to exact it's revenge.
The ending was what killed it though.
The title is a little misleading, though.
Coming,in Sirk's career ,just after "All that Heaven allows" ,it looks like its twin movie.Unlike "Written on the wind" or "Imitation of life" or "Magnificent obsession" ,it's not melodrama.It's closer to realistic psychological drama.More than the lingering charm of a romantic past (Blue Moon/You saw me standing alone/Without a love of my own),Sirk focuses on the selfishness of the children.Remember in "All that Heaven..." how the son and the daughter could not admit that their mother (of the upper class) should fall in love with a gardener and how they bought her a TV set where she only could see the reflection of her loneliness.Here the boy's attitude is not far from that: a spoiled child -as his sisters are- ,only concerned by his studies and his love affair,he does not care if his papa has become a nine-to-five man ,useful only for the dough he brings home,a life no more exciting than that of the toy robot he sells.Barbara Stanwyck 's role recalls the 1953 effort "all I desire" : the return of the woman,be she legitimate or a former flame.But in "there's always tomorrow",one can notice one of the permanent features of melodrama though: the woman who turns her back on love and becomes a successful businesswoman (or star) (see also the end of "written on the wind" "imitation of life" or Stahl's "only yesterday")
It's a shame that it is not more widely available, a radiant film from the 50s (though troubled and moderately sexist, symptomatic of the time period, but not so blatant that it can't be overlooked in the same way that critics can overlook the racism in 'Birth of a Nation').
Personally I was happy to see the foul mouthed fat kid keel over from heart attack though I don't think that was how Leigh intended the audience to react and I suspect many a weeping wallower was wringing tears from their hanky.
Both actors are pretty recognizable to American audiences, as Auteuil has appeared in tons of films--playing a sort of "everyman" character and Bouquet played the female lead in one of the Bond films (FOR YOUR EYES ONLY), though she's done plenty of films as well.
It's a good story and well worth watching, even though it was mildly let down by the acting.
It's hilarious though...  ...doesn't save the film in the slightest, mind.
Overall though it was a really bad movie - especially since the reference to the badly arranged sets of 1960'es B movies was probably unintentional.
The acting is first rate from the leading five, though Embeth Davidtz, an experienced actress, is confined to a character with little scope for the talents she has displayed in previous films, and I find it disappointing that her acting skills were curtailed by such a restrictive screenplay.
The captain jumps maybe 15 feet into the water to lighten the load on the hot air balloon, and everyone freaks out as though he jumped out of a plane.
Other humans are greeted with suspicion as though anyone has any reason to be afraid for their lives.
I guess the spark is gone, even though they shared the steamiest kiss in the entire series.
The one problem I have with the audit though is that the auditor questions what Mulder and Scully are still investigating if they have solved everything.
For an extremely low budget with a sometimes difficult to discern dialog (poor audio, though there is some noticeable re-dubbing), I was pleasantly surprised, especially after being disappointed with director Bill Forsyth's American comedy, "Breaking In."
I saw this 1978 "made-for-TV" film the first time it was aired, and once or twice since then (though not recently) and have never been able to forget it.
Stunningly filmed in the Pacific and Tahiti, it is believably acted, and the story is original(though its theme is universal).
The effect was to make it seem as though the director was attempting to s-t-r-e-t-c-h limited footage to take up more time.
Even though the movie is only 87 minutes short, it feels much longer.
Seriously though, Richards and Daryl Hannah are in this film, but why they are here is anyone's guess.
I though this was a pretty cool movie out the Asylum films.
I felt it lost a point for the ending, which even though I had a feeling was coming to some extent, was still disappointing.
this movies interpretation of the devil is that of baphomet, a god the templar knights worshipped that priests accused of being the devil, though adapted by satanists to be used as the devil (search on the internet for baphomet and you can find a picture) throughout the movie alot of cult sybols are shown such as the pentagram and the eye of horus, showing that the director did at least a bit of research, they also mention a few bands at the beginning, one of them being iron maiden, and they play with the belief that a record played backwards can contain secret messages, but kind of mock it.anyway i would recommend this film to anyone interested in horror/mock horror/ or movies about the apocalypse/satan.
I thought this was a very well done movie even though it had one of those disjointed plots that are so common with European flicks,(the ending had me totally confused).
For the most part though, the film is fantastic: a cult occult-thriller full of brilliant black comedy, delightfully dumb characters and a surreal storyline that successfully merges horror movie with social-commentary in its swipes at the sorry state of modernised Madrid and neo-Nazi thuggery.
I've got to say that I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Ãlex de la Iglesia's films, as this guy has an absolutely great sense of humour; and even though this movie is only half a comedy, it's far funnier than many films designed only to make its audience laugh.
Unlike those other two films, though, there's little likability to be found in the lead characters' roguishness --- save perhaps for Lorre, who gets redeemed by a "good" woman's love at the end.
I did like the idea that the Lemurians are sensitive to ultra-sonic waves though.
And YES I do enjoy the first 30 minutes where the characters are in their teens, even though it seems a little far-fetched how short time it takes for the boys to start killing the competition (I am not spoiling anything this is 20 minutes into the movie or something).
I though Craig Ross, Jr. and his cast and crew did an exceptional job with this film, especially on such a low budget!
Thenardier is an even slimier villain than Javert is, but Javert's single minded pursuit of Valjean in the novel makes the antics of Thenardier look secondary, and they are usually dismissed in the filmed versions (though not in the musical version).
The musical, though wonderful, was nothing in comparison to the book; there was just so much material in the book that it couldn't all be put in the musical.
Out of all of them though, Tyler Labine is going to blow up in a big bad way.
It is such a great change to see a new show on television that has nothing to do with "reality" or superheroes {even though I like one or two of them} It is refreshing to watch a show where the idea hasn't been done to death, I think the originality is one of the major things I like about this show.
The tale of a group of friends drifting through the sixties and seventies, getting into scrapes, having parties, trying to avoid Vietnam and doing all that stuff sixties movies live for, is well enough done, though the script gets a bit cliche-heavy at some points.
None of us were going to fight in Vietnam (though Neville claimed he had already been and would have frequent flashbacks), and none of us were into surfing, but you can see the comparison.
Who would have though that all those jokes we shared, all those lazy days walking through the forests together, all the sunsets we watched and the nights we hoped would never end, all those great times which would never come round again; who would have thought that now it is as if they have never happened at all?
John Milius's militant conservatism is somewhat subdued in this movie, though the movie was clearly made with a sense of nostalgia for a time when women and African-Americans knew their subjugated place and stayed there, and when going off to die pointlessly in an immoral war was seen as heroic and poignant.
The performances are one-dimensional, though that's probably more the fault of the script than the actors.
There's some great footage of water, and some fine surfing, though not enough for my taste.
Unfortunately its surfer subject matter did not draw many non-enthusiasts to the theatre; even though the film is a lot more than surfing, containing a very original universal message about the process of living and changing.
I gave up after an hour, though it failed the 20 minute rule where at that point I realise it hadn't captured my imagination.
Jill Clayburgh's portrayal of Lombard is lively albeit somewhat over-acted and strained, though the entire production is first rate with a solid supporting cast.
Even though James Brolin (who played Clark) was I suppose alright acting-wise, he was not the best.
Based on a pretty good book by Warren G. Harris, the problem with "Gable & Lombard" isn't so much the acting (Brolin does what he can in a no-win situation, and Clayburgh's halfway decent, though it's nearly impossible to suspend disbelief and believe she's Lombard), but the script.
I would though recommend not watching it on tv as it was edited so badly it took away from the story lines.
The ghost is what makes the story interesting even though Katherine(Elisha) is the only person in town who "believes" him.
I also found the killer clown's remarks entertaining, even though none of them really had much to do with the story.
And the concept of a killer clown, though a bit clichÃ©, is still pretty funny.
There's zero suspense, or what else did you expect, and the screenplay stupidly enough often hints at supernatural powers even though there's no logical explanation for this.
The heist goes terribly wrong, though, and Harris kills no less than five gangsters and two police officers.
The moneybag at the end leaves some hope for tomorrow, even though the hope is for most of the protagonists themselves too late.
In fact, in a very odd way, it was rather compelling--though certainly NOT the type film I'd like to see very often (if I did, I'd have to change my name to "Dieter" and move to someplace chic, like Paris or Prague).
The key feature of the film though is the excellent soundtrack - it really is outstanding.
The ending a wonderful elegiac surprise and even though the film is experimental it remains truly mainstream in its vision overall.
It was in the second half, though, that the film really hit its stride.
This made the conclusion so much more heart-wrenching, even though the consequences did seem a little clichÃ©d.
This animated version of Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" was directed by the legendary Chuck Jones, though the film doesn't at all appear like any of his typical work.
In many ways the film seems a bit ordinary today, though for 1971 it was a rather extraordinary film.
Overall, I'd give this film a 7--though it's almost good enough to get an 8.
The pacing causes one to feel as though Scooge has very little time left to mend his ways.
As compelling as the drawings are though, I find the story at 24 minutes a little too short for my tastes so the transformation of Scrooge at the end is not as complete as I would like it to be.
Another slasher clichÃ© is the creepy janitor, who often acts as either a prime suspect or red herring, but again Drive-Thru acts as though it's playing the game, only to suddenly perform a bodyswerve and wrong-foot us.
From a historical point of view, this is an amazing look back into the scary days of the nuclear arms race, though as I said above it's all very heavy-handed.
Deeper than that, though, is the ending, which draws a clear comparison of the "medicine-man" tactics used by all those aforementioned enemies and the McCarthyites, who at the time of this film's release were in full swing.
Even though Rooney makes some "cute" comments, the lack of "feel" for the story is apparent.
His attention to detail and experience (this is his 120th film) are quite evident, though necessarily the most imaginative.
My suspicions turned out to be unfounded, though, as the film was actually surprisingly good.
One could argue, though, that a laughably clichÃ© plot was their goal, that they were somehow trying to recreate the far-fetched plot horror flicks of years past.
It is one of my favorite cartoon shorts of all time (and I'm over 50, though not as old as this 'toon!)
When he finishes, he slaps his hand downward towards them as though a signal for them to follow up with their energetic dance steps.
They smile, look at each other, and slap arms toward him, as though inviting him to repeat the whole mad dance number he has just completed.
And of course there's the great Bela Lugosi in what seemed like a cameo, even though he's on the screen almost as much as the star of the movie the gorilla, role as Uncle Stevens creepy butler Peter.
I pretty much have to say that, even though these type of movies are so clichÃ©d, I was rooting for the young couple and half expected them to elope together to annoy her their respective parents.
Animation quality has aged a bit better though, with only the first episode looking genuinely old hat by now.
Even though "City of Men" does not involve the same characters of "City of God", it still does incorporate the same themes of it predecessor including: friendship, loyalty, drugs, poverty, violence, and survival.
Even though many of the themes are terrifying and at sporadic times disturbing to look at, "City of Men" continues to keep it rio on the realities of a drug & gang induced life in Rio's favelas.
Ace, though only 18, lives with his wife Cris (Camilla Monteiro) in one of the shanties and is the father of a young boy named Clayton (Vinicius Oliveira).
We want them to defy the odds and survive until adulthood though the tragic history of life in the Rio slums is never far from our mind.
a buddy-buddy movie with the favela drug war on the background, though we all know ordinary life somehow always goes on even in the most violent, crude realities.
Even though it followed the grief of just one of the families, you just new that it represented all of them.
Bill Paxton: "So, we could dump the batteries, though, right, and we'd come up no matter what?"
As an awesome IMAX experience 7 out of 10, though try for 3D rather than 2D.
It does make it very interesting though.
Sandra Kerns who played Mrs. Powell disappeared even though her name and face were in the credits, she left sometime during the production to raise her own family sadly.
Funny though that they always went back to the usual Columbo style we all are so accustomed to.
The actual movie itself also really feels like it goes into a trance though.
One thing McGoohan still does right though is the movie its humor.
Though being a close personal friend of Peter Falk, he probably gave him a bit too much room though to do his comedy thing, since he definitely goes a bit over-the-top with it at times.
It has a good typical Columbo ending though.
Even though I was not a major fan of either star, I found the movie to be sad because I never realized just how bright their early careers had been, and how much they had going for them when they became so popular with the "I Love Lucy" show.
The comedy seems to be a struggle between sciences that even though sound similar, are completely opposite.
She did have one of the most exquisite faces of all time, though.
Why so many people are singing this movies praises is odd though not entirely a mystery.
Other than him though it's frankly a little dull with only the scenery adding any comfort.
Even though the director is on screen for virtually every shot, it's not an egotistical piece.
He also proves himself to be a competent director, even though that hasn't been a calling he's pursued subsequently.
Even though I had a few moments of sobriety during this particular binge, it still never occurred to me to pick the remote which was still in the same place.
I will say though that the last bit of the Apostle (SPOILER) is a great reminder of Duvall's power: he continues to preach even as a prisoner on a chain gang.
Most people of a religious disposition should have little difficulty with the film as a film though they may not always like what they see from a religious viewpoint.
I saw this movie on late night local TV and I feel like the network owes me money even though it was at no cost to me, well, my soul has been taxed heavily.
This is the best I've seen Richard Pryor star in, and the real life Horatio Alger story is a real force for success motivation, even though I am a WASP.
It presents many of the events of the novel, though many are left out as well, but it does so in a very bland "well here's what happened" sort of way.
One major thing missing though is how much of a hassle Henry's time traveling is for his own life and everyone else's around him.
Oddly, though he is mentioned, Claire's brother is not even in the movie or at least has no dialogue.
It was like seeing old friends again, even though I saw the movie for the fist time.
Even though the film is thoroughly enjoyable, the constant skips back and forth through time are rather mind-boggling.
Even though it's in the book the quote "Long ago, men went to sea, and women waited for them, standing on the edge of the water, scanning the horizon for the tiny ship.
Even though the young Henry doesn't really convince you that much, the scenes are so adorable that you overlook the petty details.
Again, though, just because I know the novel is a masterpiece should not detract me from the film; it is its own entity.
Henry's condition makes him look like a selfish person, even though he has no control over the circumstances.
Even though the film is thoroughly enjoyable, the constant skips back and forth through time are rather mind-boggling.
You know what though?
What does work best of all is its simplicity though.
*...don't get me wrong, I do like the movie though).
i would recommend this film to the girls aged around 4&10 even though i may be a little bit old for this film i still feel the same way i did for this film when i was younger.
words cannot described the way i feel about this film though.
I love it so much that I went out and bought the DVD of it, even though I'd seen it 8 or 10 times already.
If you check out my other reviews though, I'm no major critic.
After the dirty deed of assassination is done, it's Antony and Octavius though they are teaming up against the conspirators, you can tell both in this version and in the better Fifties version that MGM put out that they will soon be at odds.
When 28 days later came out along with its favorable reviews, I though that it was going to be better than Resident Evil but after watching it, 28 days later came out to be nowhere near as good as Resident evil.
The zombies were not the main point of the story though...the writers were actually smart in the fact that there was a certain step to follow in the movie to survive.
The movie plays well, even though it is apparent that some scenes have been cut to achieve an R-rating.
The zombies here are a little bit faster though.
A lot of the later vampire visuals though remind one more of the 60s Italian Horror films and the British Hammer films.
Every actor looked as though they had no experience.
Even though he is still a teenager, his seriousness and bravery make his a truly amazing character.
Suddenly though the chase is interrupted by an oblivious imam who pops out onto an exterior balcony to announce that it's time for afternoon prayer.
However, the inventive and comical score (fun use of bassoon and oboe) was neglected though it deserved the only nod.
This film is highly reminiscent of the gangster films made by Warner Brothers throughout the 1930s, though oddly it has less action and more talking--a strange thing indeed for a silent film!
Despite this and it's talkiness, it's still a decent film with an exceptional print through most of the film--though in a few tiny spots it is scratchy and appears in need of further restoration.
I believe the picture is longer than 60 minutes, though.
Maybe scary movie 3 lacked the split you side in a roar of laughter factor but it was still decent enough for the franchise.I hope though that the franchise ends at 5 as i don't want it to go on and start to get boring.Whenever i watch these films i cant help but kill myself laughing and really i don't know how people can find these films even the slightest bit unfunny.
The saw part(s) were good though.
Brokeback Mountain is also parodied (though I do not understand why this was considered a scary movie).
Another example is during the village parody, when they are all having a meeting and the blind woman comes in to go to the "toilet"...Toilet humour is funny though...if you are about 3!
My favorite characters are Kate and Chelsea even though they aren't known as the nicest people at least they they are believable.
The narration explains the important things said, though subtitles would have been nice.
And though the plot (or I should say, the second portion of the movie) isn't the most original (SEE: Tales from the Crypt Presents Demon Knight) it's still entertaining and recommended for horror buffs.
'Frantic' was dismissed as a poor man's Hitchcock, though I thought it was a pretty good stab at doing a Hitchcock, suspenseful enough.
Nigel is intrigued by an entwining and serpentine tale Oscar tells him, and so are we, and even though it starts to sound incredulous, he has to return to Oscar's quarters to hear more.
I felt as though I had to keep watching and somehow I did not want to leave and let go of it until the end.
Even though sometimes the same storyline can drag on and on and yes it is a bit annoying but it makes you keep on watching and sometimes sitting on the edge of your seat.
The acting is uniformly excellent even though Douglas' name should really be above Turner's in the titles, given the relative scale of their parts, never mind their performances.
Each of the three owes their livelihood to Jonathan Shields, and I think that this is the true root of their hatred: they're eternally in debt to him, and like Faust, feel as though they have traded their souls for a room at the top.
Gloria Grahame somehow managed to snag an Oscar for her relatively minor role, though I must admit that she is memorably fetching.
Really, though, Hollywood was just, as usual, rewarding a woman for playing a bad girl of easy virtue.
Dick Powell is great, though his character makes no sense (how did he ever hook the vixenish Graham anyway?).
The animation is cheap, though still not half as bad as shows like Pokemon.
Rest assured, though, if they ever made a Thundercats movie with feature-quality animation, I'd be first in line...
It wasn't a total waste of money though, I have a younger brother and sister who were born after the Thundercat era and have grown up on the "new" 3d cartoons (that have absolutely no morals or lesson to be learned) so seeing them watch the series was OK I guess!
All the ThunderCats were superb characters, though I must say Tygra is my favorite.
One of the stupid things i noticed in it though was the mutants.
Good cloak and dagger action drama set in London 1939.Has very good sets and story but could have been a classic if it had better directing and script/screenplay.The director had a little difficulty finding a good balance between being edgy or watered down in a more Hollywood way.Great entertainment though for cloak and dagger fans and big fans of the lead stars.Selleck looks really good here.....
Frequently though, the story lines drag and are plots are repeated.
It does display humanity by the bucketload though and in a very un-Hollywood way, reveals the flaws as well as the strengths of the characters.
Even though I've spent a fair amount of time in England, I confess that I'm often baffled by North Country and Midlands accents.
Of course it is, though it strives not to be.
Even though I know that the Care Bears are not real... and in fact are animated- I still view them as real beings and follow their actions by caring.
I have to say that even though I grew up watching the original Care Bears cartoons and movies, I would rate this one above those due to it's not pandering to kids and dumbing everything down.
His identity then was bound to the fantasy of the Jews in the garden, even though his realistic father says they are not his type.
DeSica still wanted to show the world what it was like in Italy during the darker times and even though he had a larger budget and professional actors in his films his attitude never really shifted.
To the Finzi-Continis, though, it doesn't really matter.
The ending was suitably thrilling and strange - the Doctor once again saves the day, though, but the last words of this episode leave us waiting for the conclusion of this series which promises to be suitably dark and mysterious.
Acting in bad faith, Karen refuses to choose between her two lives, though both David and her husband eventually push the decision on her.
You have to hand it to the inventors, though: they were trying to better mankind.
Even though this one is so-so, it still has some character.
Even though she doesn't mean it as an insult.
Their characters add nothing to the story and it seems like they were only used to get good advertisement for the movie but I seriously doubt that it worked though.
I kind of liked the 'James Bond' like opening credits and music though!
Shaloub makes it work though.
There's also a Frankenstein that looks more like a mushroom man from ATTACK OF THE MUSHROOM PEOPLE and his face is just,....well,...impossible to describe, though comparing it to Frankenstein is NOT possible!
Possibly Adamson's most famous film, and even though it's cheap, silly, trashy and completely nonsensical, there's enough going on here (and an interesting enough cast) to qualify it as a must see to die-hard horror fans.
It's hard to understand how people can consider Lana Turner a terrible and wooden actress, though it's possible these critics haven't seen her early films.
Roscoe Karnes has an idea to stage a phony search in colleges across the country for the actress' replacement--though in reality, he has already chosen Lana Turner for the role.
Either could have done a fine job in this film, though seeing Turner in her more natural look of 1939 was very refreshing--with much less make-up and more natural looking hair.
The actors are really, really bad - and even though the main character plays a villain, he seems more like a sissy retarded wimp.
Loved the eye lashes though ;)
Kubrick's's best film ever.absolutely mind-blowing.quite disturbing though but that's what moves us.he has amazingly blended the disturbing scenes with the lovely music of Beethoven.a riveting journey of a vicious young hoodlum in modern England who is caught due to the betrayal of his friends and his journey through aversion therapy that drives him to try and do himself in and his cure at last.i never thought i would understand and really appreciate this film but i did and i say that it is one of the best films of the century.Kubrick has excelled himself and i truly feel it is his best film ever.it also has an absolutely mind-blowing performance by young Malcolm Mcdowell as Alex,the best acting performance i have seen.
Be prepared, though, it does contain quite a lot of disturbing themes and ideas, and is not in any way for the faint of heart.
The response of lawmakers who banned this critical statement on social order proved their fear by banning it almost immediately though it still managed an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture and Best Director and deservedly so.
What it does, though a series of "sessions," is cure a violent individual from his sickness; he will feel terrible pain if involved in any sort of violence after the medicine takes place.
I definitely don't recommend the production to everyone, though.
Even though the character is meant to be despised, I couldn't help but to be very convinced and interested in his sick, demented, psychotic mind.
Quickly, though, the case changes from a missing-persons situation to a murder, as a burned, dismembered body is found near Mike's base.
In the end, though, it's not about exactly what happened to Mike, it's really a referendum on the insanity of war.
This is a mystery that is solved in the end, but it's not a simple explanation; even though the motives and means for Mike's murder are revealed, nothing is really settled; only more, deeper questions on top of questions emerge.
The film pulls no punches, yet it also refrains from sensationalizing events - as though Haggis realized that the truth was viciously cruel enough without embellishment.
For the most part, though, In the Valley of Elah is an intriguing mystery and a powerful story.
Parents sometimes do not know what their kid is up to, especially if the latter so decides to keep it under tight wraps, though whatever the case, they are always angels to the eyes of their parents.
When he stepped behind the camera himself (Crash), the result was good, but still lacking something, and though In the Valley of Elah isn't perfect, it represents a huge step forward in the right direction.
Ultimately, though, there is very little to condemn in a courageous picture that hits its target accurately most of the time, especially thanks to a relentlessly moving central performance.
Susan Sarandon's part is fairly small as TL Jones' wife, but I can see why she wanted to take the role, and her scenes, though few, are stunning and stark.
she cries in anguish to her husband at one point), she is not allowed into the room where her son's gruesome remains lie (father was) and is expected to be stalwart and supportive, even though dad (TL Jones) set the macho tone for the home, by encouraging both sons to go into the military, where both died.
I'm not writing home to Mom over it though.
With the help of video left on Mike's cell phone, however, he discovers secrets that begin to shake his faith in American institutions though he never questions his son's actions.
It is refreshing that the jurisdictional conflict between local police and the military does not take a stereotypic turn of heavy handed conspiracy and cover-up even though the military investigators are not cast in the best light.
Charlize Theron is beautiful even though she is playing a woman who is forced to act as non-sexy as possible to get on in her job in a male police force.
Seems to affect some people though...
Shame about his appalling TV "comedy" though.
I have seen Kitano's latter films, Hana-bi, Brother, Tokyo Eyes & Gonin, and even though production values have improved, especially with Brother and Hana-Bi, I personally feel that Sonatine still remains Beat's best film to date.
Even though it is a film about Yakuza and gangland killings Kitano doesn't fill every scene with a running commentary or 100mph action-fests.
Mickey tries them & says even though they're sh*t, he's in a slump & will try anything.
this is a great movie and i think it will be considered a classic the thing that pisses me off is that Marris isn't in the Hall of fame most people who don't know much about him think he only had that one good year when he broke the record but he was the MVP of the 1960 season and he played well throughout most of his career he should be in the hall of fame without a doubt there's four people that aren't in the hall of fame that should be shoeless Joe Jackson isn't there because he threw the world series even though he played excellent and Pete rose should be in there to it doesn't matter what he did off the field its what he did on the field that counts Marris is the next person not in i already explained why but the most shocking person not to be in the hall of fame is frank Robinson what the hell happened there
For example, the Yankees' last game of the regular season, which they hosted, drew a crowd of just 22,000 even though Maris entered the game tied with Ruth and even though the Yankees went on to win the World Series that year.
This is a sharp contrast to 1998, when McGwire regularly filled stadiums in pursuit of Maris' record even though McGwire's team didn't even make the playoffs that season.
It isn't that they were poor choices, though voices in past specials easily top them, it is just that they don't say things right.
Charles Schulz requested (though since he did not hold the copyright to Peanuts he could not demand) that no one create any new Peanuts stories after his death.
In one scene one "climber" (I say that oh so tongue in cheek) belays another by just standing there (he is tied onto the rope though)while his buddy holds a hundred feet or so of loosely coiled rope in his hands between the "belay" and the prospective climber.
I was also embarrassed for the movie Vertical Limit, which, though it is also a terrible movie in it's own right, actually made an effort, and has some entertainment value including a couple of Point Break-esquire one-liners.
Conspiracy theory, though, is given the heaviest stress, in combination with the two youths getting carried away by the sheer excitement of their 'revolutionary' activities - and noses full of coke.
One of the reviews featured here, though, accused the actors of being to 'theatrical'.
Even though Hitch portrays people at their most loathsome, there is still something so charming about them that you can't help but smile and forgive their all too human foibles.
I however can only give it 7 out of 10, even though I would like to give it more.
Even though Natwick does claim to Gwen that the only reason she has invited him over, is because of the convenience of Gwens presence at the time of Harry death.
This is a rich comedy, though a very dark one indeed.
The combination proves effective on its own terms though not particularly transcendent as a memorable piece of film-making.
First of all, only Hitchcock would come out with something that could be termed a "light comedy" when the central figure in the film from beginning to end is a dead body, but a lot of Hitchcock's standard themes are very prevalent in the film, even though it differs so much from his traditional style.
The film is not that simple though, for even in addressing these objectives Hitch tantalizingly avoids any answers or definitive statements.
Be warned though, if you have an allergy to bad acting, or suffer from an inability to suspend disbelief, this probably doesn't come recommended.
Granted that he always gets typecast a lot though.
What made me sit up and take notice, though, was Nat "King" Cole's number, set in a New York nightclub.
The cast were all excellent, Lars Hanson was superb as the tormented title character Anson Campbell, he has been accused of over acting, but, Anson Campbell is a man who is losing his faith and heading for a mental breakdown to boot and Hanson portrays that with chilling clarity at times, though admittedly he was a little over wrought in some later sequences.
Sissy Spacek is brilliant as ever in a lighter, though heartfelt and often ignored situation of a mom deciding whether one more child is what she wants.
The plot is thin, though.
The military as a source of soap opera-type stories had been little-mined in the 1970s, though it certainly was going to be in the future (at least on American network TV) with shows like "For Love and Honor", "Emerald Point N.A.S."
The acting was blatant, and though I'm not overly-critical and can usually set aside a poorly-cast film, I couldn't even focus on the movie because everything simply seemed forced.
Even she was unable to get herself into this one and only finished the movies because, even though you know how it will end, you just have to see it... well, because.
And now I go and watch this "Romasanta", waiting for some excitement, even though the cast wasn't that good (Elsa Pataky, Julian SandsÂ).
This made all of them feel stiff, as though they are being forced to express sentiments and traits that are not natural to them.
Paige spots a tabloid picture of Eddie in which he isn't smiling as though he loves Kirstin, and then sets out for the school's law library with some friends to try to find the loophole that all the lawyers couldn't find.
Seriously, though, if you REALLY want a shocking movie experience, watch one of the pirated Chinese DVDs with "Engrish" subtitles.
As I watched the film though, I felt something was "off."
Film-making in Mexico hasn't changed a bit as far as content from the drug dealer and prostitute movies of the eighties, even though is a little bit more polished (to the point of being pretentious and exclusive).
though the idea of this film was good they didn't know how to put it together..one minute you're watching the entire process of putting gas to a car,walking the entire Zocalo DE Mexico.
Even though not perfect in my eyes there was enough to show that this is a director of keen and original talent who will produce much more.
Filled with tawdry, explicit male fantasies that could be construed as misogynistic, it wasn't a coincidence that I was the only woman in the theater, let alone that most of the older men were wearing long raincoats (though two did walk out half way through as even they could figure out it was much more political than erotic).
As though it's in the same metaphysical dimension as watching City of God or Capote... or Harry freaking Potter.
That hormonal piece that gets excited at the gates of Heaven even though what awaits me is just another Battle.
Mexico City looks amazing in this film - I feel as though I have really *seen* the city in a way I never have previously.
(Why o why did they put in the close up of Ana's vagina, it was pretty though).
Why (even though murder is a "deadly sin" and cannot be redeemed)?
I saw Battle in Heaven at this year's Cannes film festival, and though I had trouble sitting still and keeping my eyes on the screen, the end result was an incredibly interesting movie that experimented with new ideas, while most of the films at Cannes this year were just recycling the same ideas and techniques.
His leading lady, Shelley Hack, acts as though she were posing for the picture on front of a box of All Bran.
Joe plays a jingle writer who dreams of being a serious musician, even though all of his "serious" songs still sound like extended jingles, and the classical piece he composes to show off his true talent would be better suited for a group of musical saw players instead of an orchestra.
Mostly though, this movie is an exercise of ego for one Joe Brooks.
I will say though, it was nice to hear Michael Richards voicing a character, bit part or not (although not so nice to not hear Jason Alexander, Julia Louis-Dreyfus or Larry David at all).
With enough biological inaccuracies to cause buzzing(sorry for the pun)among a number of viewers and non-viewers,and perhaps a little TOO ambitious in scope for its own good(though not as off-the-tracks in that regard as,say,HAppy Feet),this show's strength really IS in Seinfeld,his gift of gab,smart,fast humor and his interplay with other bees(notably his parents and his brother<?> Adam,voiced by MAtthew Broderick)and the human element he encounters(most of it being with Vanessa),I'm afraid that the main strength of this film is the exact thing that could be identified as its weakness:namely,that this film is going to be too over-the-heads of kids in verbal humor,too simplistic and cutesy(thought that's forgivable for animation,I suppose)for many,if not most,adults.
Would have liked to hear more from Chris Rock though!
Instead, come in for the great dialogue and a potential step towards making more computer-animated flicks for just teenagers and adults---even though this genre is almost always marketed towards the "rugrats."
None of the women in the video are exceptionally attractive and Mariel Hemmingways height and nose bother me quite a bit, though in some scenes she does look rather foxy.
Be warned, though, that what you assume about people may be forever changed.
Not only that, it is educational, and you learn good morals without feeling as though it is being forced down your throat.
During the movie, it kind of felt like the story was going somewhere and even though it was fairly slow, I was interested.
didn't like Colee's deceased friend Randy even though he never knew him.
In a movie set in a historical period, accuracy should be more of a priority though, I think.
Chuck Norris is fantastic as always, and gives a very good acting performance here, he is very likable, kicked that ass, had good charisma, only problem i had is, he didn't show enough emotion, he was great though!
"Once Upon A Christmas" continues this tradition, though not alas for lack of trying.
I'd recommend catching the more highly rated ones first, though.
Still though, this isn't a bad film, although it's rather typical Italian stuff where you have to pay attention because otherwise you can't keep track of the players without a score card.
I though that the director of the film, (Antonio Bido) did i very good job in making the film, i found the storyline to be quite gripping to watch as the story made sense more than some other Italian horrors that i have seen.
Watch Me When I Kill, or if you like, The Cat's Victims or The Cat With The Jade Eyes is hardly one of the most notable of gialli, enough of a cultish success to get a spiffy looking remastered release in the UK though.
I enjoyed it more than the more hardcore giallo buffs seem to have done though it has its share of problems.
I still had a fine time with it though, Antonio Bido has a good eye and easy command of his art, crafting some cracking moments, and Corrado Pani and Paola Tedesco make for an appealing couple of leads.
It's left for interpretations, though, but that doesn't bother me one bit.
He does, though, warn you that the price you pay will be very high, and I will tell you that it is high.
i got it and when i put it in and it was beautiful the graphics were amazing and searching for the colossus was awesome also the environment was really interactive which was cool the game play was unique and fun and the battles and how you had to find out how to kill them were awesome also the story was the best each colossi was unique and different to kill and the story was a shocker (if you have played Ico then you might have guessed that this game is Ico prequel) this game really pushed the play stations limits though the game is short but it is unforgettable if you have never played this get it and if you have any doubts don't classic 10/10
There were a couple, though, I had to search for the way to kill them on the web.
When all is said and done, though, this is definitely a fun game and worth playing through twice, if not several more times afterward.
You don't have to be a crossword player to enjoy the movie, though it helps.
Just as interesting though is the way the more traditional powerhouses react to his presence and apparent skill.
There is a nice peak at the collaborative efforts that go into the creation of the puzzle, even though Mr. Shortz leaves little doubt that it is his responsibility ... hate mail and all.
Worth a look, though probably more so for fans of the activity.
Apart from this, however, the film is enthralling, intriguing and predominately well-acted (though the male lead leaves something to be desired).
The VHS cover's a laugh though, it says that is was too gory for TV, that's why it went straight to video-- yeah, try to prop up that fragile ego of your's Mr. Filmmaker.
Still a good effort though.
I would have gladly sat through another 6 (not all in the same night though!).
Arguably, though, it is worth the effort.
You can watch this movie straight through without missing a second and still feel as though you walked away from it several times for 5 minutes.
The plot didn't seem astrological, though one of the characters says about four times that the "Moon is in Scorpio" which she explains as being a time of fear, retribution, etc.
Keeping that in mind though, the last film that I saw from Gary Graver was the abysmal 'slasher' Trick or Treats, which in all honesty made Plan 9 from Outer Space look intellectual.
All praise to his son Nick though, for he is also a capable director, yet there can never be another John Cassavetes again.
Maybe it is the entry into a very real world that isn't so extreme or unusual--though we are shown an especially awful and pivotal moment in that world--a milieu present in every small city, and common in a big one.
Even though Lance Henriksen is getting all the attention in this movie, there are a a few other great performances in this movie.
I'd love to see it again, though, and I hope I'd be pleasantly surprised.
The film is about a post-apocalyptic future, though the future looks an awful lot like France circa 1950 (as well as having burned out hulks of buildings and the sky is brown).
I don't know enough to say if the concept is completely original, but it didn't remind me of anything I've seen or read before(I hear that at least one aspect is similar to Brazil, though).
But you won't really care when you see it, because even though the story isn't really elaborate, what you have here is one of the most original movies you'll ever get your eyes on.
I think its a production for a local community in America, how com i can buy it in pound land in the UK though!!!???
It's important to remember that even though this is a US anti drugs film it was brought by a Hong Kong based distributor (Panorama Entertainment).
About all there is to it with the plot though there is a surprise near the end of the film.
Great use of Chicago locations, though the "L" trains running past my house don't appear to have the conveniently flat roofs to jump on.
Also I found the performance of Lisa Kudrow too Friends Â like and I though that DeNiro could not cry that convincingly, but that latter doesn't really matter to me that much, for this is a comedy.
The script is very sharp and shrewdly sidesteps the predictable whenever possible (though there is always a certain level of welcome predictability in this sort of material).
I'm almost surprised this even came in the mail via netflix (though not that it didn't, apparently, get theatrical distribution here in the states).
It is as though we are actually committing these atrocities vicariously, and if not, are at least silent witnesses.
You're watching two great performers and the humor, though sometimes racy, is all in good taste.
He is almost emotionless...though he will let the family members know when they are doing something wrong by banging it into their head.
The script is as good as the acting (which, though a bit theatrical, is superb).
At first, this is an unlikely pairing but you know if you know anything about the great Dame Judi Dench (even though she prefer you call her just Judi, no Dame Judi or Ms. Dench).
In her near-unconscious state she has what should be a disturbing encounter with Max - a DJ/producer with a sensitive heart even though he'd sleep with a woman when she's passed out.
This is a pretty good doc though some things are left out or underplayed (her father and husbands sexual orientation) but you can always read a Garland biography for those details; books don't give you the film clips the show does.
All in all, though, a good two hours on Sunday afternoon.
Even though Joe Dekko is obviously a real lowlife, you can't help but like him.
I would also like to comment on the cinematographer's lighting (though ultimately the director has to o.k.
The humour was very dark though.
Overall a very sad story though.
), though fortunately the brilliant allegory of the tree is not lost with the title change.
Then back to Dave, Victor a completely unconcerned Fire Chief, even though his men have been missing for ages and the obligatory Dave's wife ringing him to find out where he is shot.
This film reminds me a bit of the Hugh Grant comedy Mickey Blue eyes, though this film is a bit better, not a bit, but a lot.
Successive productions though became increasingly elaborate, obscure and reflecting obsessions with his own disabling illness and young women largely as sex objects.
But there were a number of inconsistencies, that could have easily been cleared up without adding any extra time to the film; though at one hour and twenty minutes another 15 or 20 minutes to give us some backstory certainly wouldn't have made this film overly long.
The best thing I can say about Seven Mummies is that it's watchable if you've got nothing better to do & it's reasonably well made, other than that though I'm finding it very difficult to say anything positive about it.
The plot jumped around non-stop, and it was practically impossible to follow, even though it was incredibly simplistic.
That didn't stop me from befriending other strays though, as this movie taught me many valuable lessons about life.
I remembered the main points though, the little boy who lived with his mother, nursing a homeless cat back to health in an abandoned building before and after school, the tragedy that happens, the saddest moment on TV since the Martins forced Timmy to give up Lassie to move to Australia in "Timmy and Lassie", (both of these tug at the heart strings and bring a tear to the eye) and the 'turn around' happy ending.
The title says it all, this time he's in the army...though much of the time, the attempted gags don't often have that much to do with the army.
Of course, the film itself is low budget, contains mediocre acting, writing and directing (even though there are some surprisingly OK moments) but when Ernest is on the screen you can't help but smile and who cares if a film is good or not as long as it's funny?
though the judge is suspicious, the judge accepts Vinnie the lawyers assurance of an impressive record of some wins and losses and permits Vinnie despite reservations to try a case where the ultimate penalty hangs over both defendants.
though utterly inexperienced before an hostile court, Vinny manages with a little help from his girl friend Mona to draw victory in a case of mistaken identity from the jaws of defeat.
I suspect that most people would agree with me if not for her having received a surprising Oscar, followed by persistent (though implausible) rumors that an old and senile Jack Palance had called out the wrong name.
Unable to discourage the adamant Vitti, Sobol acquiesces and agrees to treat him exclusively for two weeks, though he is less than enthusiastic about being pressed into the service of a well-known criminal; even less enthused, however, is his fiancee, Laura (Lisa Kudrow).
The most memorable, though, is one in which Dr. Sobol dreams that he is Don Vito Corleone in the movie `The Godfather,' when he is shot while buying some fruit.
This can't really be held against the movie, though.
Even though Marisa Tomei broke through and won Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards for her performance, an award she earned and much deserved, I still say underrated.
Competent though they may have been, these were not thespian heavyweights or comedic savants.
This is a truly memorable piece of comedy, and though it was released in 1992, I'm sure comedy lovers will pay homage to this movie in the present day.
None of that stopped Nicholas Hammond from shining though.
In the main, though, Stan and Ollie were living on reputation alone.
Cute ending though.
The other girls may laugh, but when she gets into a fight with one of them, she manages to win her over afterwards so that they are friends, even though their parents are not.
I thought TBB was a good movie, not what I expected though.
I also get the impression that there are too many ideas in the screenplay, good ideas though but i think they overdid it near the end.
Good characters, good actors, not the corny end I feared but not the end I hoped to see though.
They con a group of well-off schoolchildren into paying them for the privilege of entering a magical cave, and though they get caught and have to return the money, they profit from a kickback deal with a dry cleaning establishment because the kids get coated with mud in the cave.
This whole sequence has a nice nostalgic-movie-flashback look, though the idea that children's clothing goes to the dry cleaners is far-fetched.
Wouldn't you know it though, Bloom falls for her and that gums up the works.
Banig Bang's explosions get out of hand, though again as with the car crashes it's hard to tell if this serves the plot or is simply Johnson playing around with his bigger budget.
The entire cast has to be the film's strongest point though.
Rachel Weisz does steal the show though.
This is a signification that builds up the classy ingenuity of the central con, which, though it absolutely has its definite laugh-of-mischief moments, is built up way too high.
Remember though, every story in Hollywood has pretty much been told, but its how you tell it that matters.
In the final analysis, though I definitely wanted to know more about the resolution of the Prague caper, movies can use more, not less unresolved mystery.
Getting herself out of situations that the brothers can't even fathom and catching on to things so quickly, it's as though the mark becomes the professional, however, that is exactly Stephen's plan.
It's beautiful, though quirky, and the ending scene, quite explainable and left open to your interpretation.
There was something sincerely loving between them even though one's moral sensibilities are assaulted from the get go.
Even though there's no speaking parts for two major characters, the film's acting does not suffer.
(This method of fortune-telling appears to have been invented by Kim, though possibly inspired by the common practice of dropping a dart onto a spinning disc)  The film opens in striking fashion with a shot of the weapon that inspired the film's title.
Maia Morgenstern ("The Oak" - 1992, "Betrayal" - 1993, "Ulysses' Gaze" - 1995, Procust's Bed" Â 2001, "The Passion of Christ" 2004) is excellent as Amalia Frunzetti, the prince companion and mistress, though she does not look like 30 (Maia was 42 in 2004 when the film was made).
Why the director made everything BLUE, I don't understand, though I'll ride with it.
None of the relationships in this movie are predicable, which makes it very intriguing and though all these characters are familiar to this genre, all of them come off as totally believable people.
And though I've watched it twice and am still not sure of exactly all that happened, I don't care.
Plenty of mustaches though.
When her estranged(..and very rich)mother dies(..ruled a suicide, though it's obviously not), teenage Nancy(Jenny Tamburi, twenty at the time, but succeeds in her portrayal of a coquettish Lolita-type of teenage girl who might not be the dense, naive simpleton they at first suspect)returns home from years of various boarding schools to enjoy life on the wilder side, living with lothario step-dad Marco(..the handsome Silvano Tranquilli)and successful photographer Gianna(..the sensual Rosalba Neri, so divine you can't take your eyes off of her).
They don't make this kind of movies these days...right from the start till the very end it's all full-throttle action...and the thing that gets you is this : you don't expect much of it when you see the title and info, thinking "yeaahhh...another dumbass kids movie"...and though it has a few aspects that defy a realistic movie, but man, it becomes more and more engaging by the minute and keeps you focused with its breathtaking scenes and intensity...I mean, damn...this is a well-built movie people, good acting, good plot, strong moral values...and it's all done by simple means and lines, not like the majority of the movies you see now with great actors, boring scenarios and pathetic lines.
This is a movie I will buy on DVD for repeated viewing, though I will DEFINITELY have to see it again on the large screen.
The Best Hulk Hogan Movie though, since he didn't give many good ones.
Triggering this behavior though is the accidental killing of a young woman who gets a little too aggressive and dies after Eddie pushes her off and she hits her head on a table.
I would have preferred a narrative that followed the true story, though I understand that the reason for not doing so was budget constraints.
It's an interesting take, though.
I'll admit, the start was pretty poor, I felt it was quite disjointed and it seemed as though a lot of scenes that should have been there to develop the plot were on the cutting-room floor.
What a great way to end the first season of the x-files.An apparent unrelated.minor car chase leads the agents to the discovery of what seems to be concrete evidence of a government conspiracy.The early sequence of the man being chased who then is shot emits green blood which has toxic properties is a classic.Also Deep Throat plays an important part i this episode though can the agents trust him after his lies in E.B.E?A stunning moment happens when Mulder enters the warehouse and before his very eyes is bodies in tanks of water.When he returns with Scully the bodies are gone much to Mulders disgust.He thought he had irrefutable,indisputable proof.This episode must be watched!
Even though Mcdonald's husband starred in the movie, I felt that he just didn't fit the character.
Matt... uh, sorry, Luke Goss owns the few scenes that he's in, but there's just not enough of them to save this movie, and they're irrelevant anyway since Seagal is playing his usual immortal Myrmidon Let's give Goss the last word though: "This is unbelievable," he opines, and there's not much to disabuse that notion here.
Seriously though, i you know what the film is about please tell me.
Even though it only lasts for about an hour & a half it feels much, much longer which is never a good sign, the dialogue is terrible, the character's are not fleshed out & their motives are never made clear & there isn't even much action in it which is the final nail in it's coffin really as far as I am concerned.
you look like Marlon Brando and the plot what happen to the plot i just saw a lot of people shooting and cars driving fast though the city.
He has a big problem, though.
Christy must not only hide the pain of her lonely existence and the hallucinations that plague her, she also has to face the humiliation of condescending treatment from the neighbours, nurses, and cops around her; though one of them, Jeff Burdan (Warren Christie), is pretty kind to her, his cop pal Randy (Patrick Gilmore) makes a cruel remark before being introduced to Christy.
I will say, though, that it was certainly not a failure either.
I thought that the actors were ok though, considering what they had to work with.
Even though the 30s (H&J) was a quite different era from the 1900s (Moulin), they're both distant enough from us to raise similar questions about how to handle that sort of milieu.
"Moulin Rouge" presents Erik Satie and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec as characters on the fringe of the story, tossed in for spice perhaps, but gives us not a hint about what Satie's music sounds like, nor a glimpse at any Toulouse-Lautrec canvas (though I credit the production design with getting something of his feel into how the film looks.)
Even though it is NC-17 I don't see it as "dirty" just boldly erotic.
The one who stole the film though is Kevin Spacey(Early in his career)as Osbourne, the writer that's obsessed with naked female contortionists.
Plus Amber Tamblyn, who far from sucks here, and Melissa Leo, who never gets enough to do in movies - though, Jesus, girl, you are racking up the films lately.
I think Leo's made as many films in the last four years as she made her entire previous career - though, again, she usually doesn't get too many lines.
Actually, Hilary Brougher raises this picture somewhat above its disadvantages through nuance, innuendo, and lack of blatancy, though this very ambiguity does ultimately queer the ending, as in, I don't really get what's going on with the shrink character when credits roll.
Brougher has courage to address an issue most people wish to submerge - that of unwanted teenage pregnancies and their consequences - and she does it in the form of a story that is so well woven and presented with such fine actors that she not only succeeds in bringing attention to her main topic, she also introduces us to two women whose lives, though separated by years of age, are significantly parallel.
But definitely not for anyone, not for those who need special effects or to be blasted from the chair by action or violence... for a mature audience even though the message is about the kids the movie is for their parents, to change how sex is taught in school...
I want to single out Elizabeth Wilson as the Mother, who exudes warmth and love, though in a contextually "loopy" way.
There are a couple of twists in the ending, though one makes very little sense.
Acting, though, is excellent.
I also enjoyed Roy Billing as George, Will's father, the Aussie Battler personified (though Roy is actually from New Zealand).
By the way, although it looked cool, why did Shaft bother to blow up the bunker at the end of the film even though the bad guy and all his men were dead?!
I found it pretty funny, though some might think otherwise.
The very premise of the film is fascinating, and though we've seen the "old-time hero in the modern world" premise before and since, this is one effort that really delves into the potential of that idea.
It's a flawed film in many ways- the humor is uneven, ranging from the clever to the silly (often at the same time- though "Amazing Computer Brain is Stuck!"
It's a charming albeit pretty frank theme expertly handled by Lubitsch, slyly toying with his audience as usual, though I suppose if he could come back today and re-make it that any charm would be lost in graphic scenes of sex and violence Â back then it was discipline that was required instead.
However, despite all this, the film really is mostly tease without a whole lot of action--though there is some implied sex (such as when March spent the night and was having breakfast with Hopkins halfway through the film).
If you think of the central situation, though, and Gilda's reluctance to split the two "boys" there is a trace of Coward's original idea there.
for the low brow crowd...lucy lui is naked in this  seriously though, this movie was quite good.
The movie seems to lack the proper emotions to see this as a completely effective one, though the right intentions are definitely there.
(Actually, Richard Jaeckel, Skip Homeier and Richard Boone played numerous bad guys who I still enjoyed watching even though I wanted them to 'get theirs'.)
I think though that I could tolerate Majors and Roberts and the storyline a lot better if there wasn't this tenuous attempt to connect this story with High Noon.
This film has little to recommend it, though that little being the breathtaking scenery, cinematography and direction of wildlife, it is difficult to bring up its weak points in the company of such rave reviews.
Seen on my TV, the photography is not as breathtaking, though it is still very beautiful.
The movie, which boasts just one human being in its cast, young actress Bertille NoÃ«l-Bruneau, tells the story of the rather rare, though seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox.
Part-nature documentary, and part-fairy tale, the film focuses on L'Infant, the child, who on her way to school one day comes across the path of a wild fox in a picturesque setting, possibly France, though the exact location is never mentioned.
Even though it's been cut and banned many times, the gore isn't all that nasty, or frequent; with only a few sequences really hitting the 'disgusting' mark.
Naturally the film caused a hystery due to its sadistic and graphic (but not gratuitous) violence and many producers and directors started to rip that film off in order to "satisfy" the audience that liked the violence in Deodato's film so much even though that is definitely not even the film's point, it is its theme, and everyone watching Holocaust because of its violence are closer to the film's message than they could have ever (dared to) thought.
Beware the epilogue again, though!
I am not a big fan of the gothic Italian cinema, though he is regarded as a master of this genre.
All though this doesn't affect Norman the only non hospitalized Vietnam veteran who was bitten by Tony King (Note that is the guys real name)and how their urges of hunger come to matter (cannibalsim), and yes we can all say "We know what they are feeling."
It just wasn't a good-time in America, though in-retrospect, life was better than it is today (2006), which should scare most young-people.
It's very primal and hits the audience on a subconscious-level, even though it owes a debt to Romero.
Even though not one of his masterpieces, "Apocalypse Domani" aka.
Hammer folded shortly afterwards, and this movie contributed to that - even though it made a healthy profit.
Christopher Lee was very unhappy with these scenes, while Dennis Wheatley was revolted and said afterwards that Hammer would never again adapt one of his stories Â though neither Wheatley nor Hammer would live to see this defiance tested.
The usually reliable Van Heflin is equally unconvincing, though certainly better than Rogers.
Partly, though, it comes from the actors.
Ginger Rogers does a broad-stroke interpretation of a broad-stroke character, George Raft is stolid as a policeman, though it is only a supporting role despite his star billing.
Peggy Ann Garner plays a scheming young girl (though she is 22 playing 20, she seems too old for the part, and is strangely frumpy and dull) who wheedles her way unscrupulously into affluent company with a pretence of innocence.
I'm kinda warming to Ms. Rogers, though I'm still not finding her face memorable.
"Black Widow" is a well-written, though old-style, entertaining mystery.
It was all very innocent, though.
It still is even though the year is 2005.
I have this movie 9 even though I could have easily given it 10.
Lastly, even though their acting may not be real hot, Gutterboy and Skank are fairly believable (and hilarious) characters.
If you accept that it takes two of the characters a long time to figure out who Jake really is, even though the evidence of his past is written on his back, the film is a decent revenge film.
Sheen, though top-billed, has little to do and isn't particularly charismatic when he's on screen.
At the 39 minute mark though, "Dead Life" not only does everything right, it actually surpasses most Hollywood films and does a lot of things better.
That's not to say that all zombie movies are GOOD though; and that brings me to the movie I am here to-night to talk about, William Victor Schotten's DEAD LIFE.
This isn't good though because it's more shameless than horrifying.
So he goes, and after one of the most brilliant montages ever, hes able to return home a ninja, though like a lot of kung-fu films he still doubts his true ability.
The next thing you notice is the toytown quality of the sets, reminiscent of the castle in Les Visiteurs du Soir, the whole town, interior and exterior looks as though it never needs sweeping or cleaning.
The biggest attraction of this film, though, is the wit of its script, which could rival any comedy of Shaw or Wilde or Colette, and top them all for sheer virtuosity in the art of depicting the many faces of love, and its delivery by one of film history's most finely cast troupe of comedians.
When she awakes people think she has amnesia and even though she hasn't - she goes along with it.
I watched it with subtitles; even though the script is very substantial, it isn't necessary to follow up each conversation.
The movie is incredibly bad, too bad that even A.R.Rahman couldn't save it with really lackluster music and songs, he cant be blamed though there was nothing to get inspired to make even decent music.
However, they're really disgusting also, and the final scene; even though the 'monster' is a doll, really is nightmarish.
It wasn't brilliantly written, it was a bit 'storytelling' but the cast was great - Gerard Depardiu didn't do very much though - it seemed as though he was drunk from time to time!
Or though not one of best Muskateer movies it is quite an enjoyable one.
Even though it is another movie ride, it wasnt that bad.
The story for The Haunted Mansion, though well intentioned, seems lacking and predictable.
All in all, though, this is a good family movie that's unlike any other movie out there.
His first 'Doctor Dolittle' movie was pretty decent, even though he'll never be able to truly replace Rex Harrison.
I really think, though, that he deserved better than this pale wraith of a flick.
Some sequences however might be a bit too disturbing for really young children though, so be aware of that.
The movie nevertheless has a great sense of adventure though in which a group of people gets trapped in an haunted house, with a new adventure in every room.
Not sure if the movie is really as effective as a comedy than as an adventure movie though.
Oh well, perhaps children will still find the movie funny in parts, though some of the jokes are obviously aimed toward adults.
On top of that the movie also features the wonderful Deep Roy, in a really small role though.
So humour, Gothic scenery, and hints of horror make this film a delight to watch...over and over again; I am still SHOCKED by the negativity towards it though.
And I liked the whole concept of the curse (even though it doesn't make any sense).
It's not a bad movie, though.
The only thing that i think is bad with this movie is the child actors, they just look bored going round the mansion with straight faces even though they follow ghostly orbs into unknown places.
Kids won't be interested in the story though, they just want a fun film to watch.
For once though it works, this film is fun, amusing, well acted, and well worth watching.
Still boring, though.
Even though she didn't live to see the year 2000 she has this one remarkable film for her only movie of the 21st century.
I have to say though this is the perfect film for us to remember the wonderful and beautiful and the very multi-talented star Madeline Kahn.
And it was nice to see a film of this nature done in black and white for once...and done so just because black and white can be as beautiful as color (though it's clearly not up to the standards of earlier Hollywood films), not because it's attempting to be some kind of pseudo-noir film.
Even though both were great movies, "Judy Berlin" is better.
Best of all though is Jason Durr's performance as Lord Kiely, commander of the Royal Palace guard and a man obsessed with making his name and the name of his regiment go down in military history.
Best of all though, you get another hour and forty minutes of dashing heroism, unchecked violence and daring-do, but with a bit more humanity this time around.
Then again though, nobody gets hit by a truck in Substitute 4...  * out of 4-(Bad)
You buy into it because you feel as though they are carrying on this long legacy of artistic expression.
I felt as though I was running through Brooklyn with the characters.
The whole movie though, it's just amazing...
(be warned though... it's sad...)
The Scooby Doo is a very good show, though not as good as my childhood favourite Scooby Doo Where Are You?
On the plus side though, asides from how it was filmed and the good plot and script, we are also treated to a first-rate cast.
Adrian Lukis and Sophie Ward are a little on the dull side as the Kendalls though.
If you want a better Hickson- Marple adaptation though, try Murder Is Announced and Sleeping Murder.
I re watched this recently a found it surprisingly worthwhile though hopelessly trapped in 80's TV movie-land - it had a good Mr Rafiel!
This Hickson version is quite faithful to the book though it has to be said that Christie spent less time mourning the death of the maid than this more PC version.
though i can't remember if the show actually revealed how racer-x looked like, in the manga, they did.
Even though `Cannibal Man' does contain a couple of nasty butchering sequences, it merely is drama and an alarming social portrait.
Apparently, Hanna Barbera is skipping over the other half of these shows, though I don't understand why.
The slaughterhouse... "The Cannibal Man" is entertaining enough, though not all that gory or stocked with T & A, yet it moves along briskly, has a nice solid story with good pacing, and establishes the characters well.
It's an excellent film in the vein of DERANGED (1974), HENRY and CONFESSIONS OF A SERIAL KILLER, though it predates all three.
Even though there's only a hint of (accidental) cannibalism in this misleadingly titled effort, CANNIBAL MAN is an underrated psycho-thriller/character study well worth checking out.
We sympathize with Marcus's situation, even though his actions are illegal.
That being said though, Smith is able to write some amazing characters.
I did like one scene though, and that was the different take on "The Return of the Jedi".
All things being equal though, go see something else.
Until writer/director Eric Weber stoops to the standard male competitive reflex of jealousy over women ending in fisticuffs, which, frankly, just doesn't make sense for these guys despite the Cyrano analogy, he does present an articulate examination (with a lot of Yiddish phrases) of coming to grips with aging, from their own health problems to the mother's nursing home (though Barbara Barrie seems much more spry than the other residents).
That more depressing side of aging baby boomers was left out of "Sideways," though this film also has plenty of funny one-liners, sometimes with easy targets like Hollywood and books, to compensate.
While the women's tolerance of their men's quirks is saintly, at least they are not portrayed as total bitches, though this is a somewhat cynical reunion for Pantoliano and Jennnifer Tilly since "Bound."
Even though she survives, she develops a strange affection - one may say addiction - for ice and cold.
It is definitely a psychological thriller and I felt like it gave me lots to think about after it ended even though I felt as though I was missing something during the movie.
Other than that, though, the film made absolutely NO sense whatsoever.
Weird movie though.
Â throughout most of this (beginning with the very opening sequence)Âthough she also suffers the ignominy of having to scream her head off, ostensibly in abject terror, during an attack by a hilariously fake arachnid (albeit inside a reasonably atmospheric spider-pit)!
Even though the time since I watched this piece of cinematic history fades away I feel compelled to document my personal experience with the motion picture.
Even though this film is bound by about as much storyline as the ingredients on a packet of Special K, it manages to keep the mild interest of the viewer through a string of scantily clad females, naked dancing and what could only be described as bouts of randomness.
Hard to find though.
The speed or lack of it isn't the point of the film, though.
What I'd like to know, though, are there other films of this nature around?
Even though this film was made a few years ago, and this problem is perhaps a little more evident today, the principal's speeches about teachers and school officials hugging and touching students to make them feel good, etc., was incredibly stupid and naive on the part of the writers.
This movie wasn't a blockbuster though it did make an important point about US health care with its rising cost and declining quality.
Go see this movie, but be forewarned: even though most people are aware from the media or their own experience of what's going on today, watching this movie may make you become motivated enough to go out and help change things, if even in some small, personal way.
Nick Hamm keeps it moving along though, weaving the relationship threads together competently enough whilst Hollander and Sewell give pat representations of their character-tropes.
discovers the bow and arrow (though he looks like he wouldn't invent his way out of a paper crate) and defeats him.
Morality and a keeping of the body in this case Sam Pasco as Ela and others though less so are entertaining, inspiring, and for me hope giving in life.
The answer is the pretty mysterious case of bodybuilder Sam Pasco, who seem to have appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared (having never acted in a film since) even though he really isn't bad at all in this movie.
Anyway, the whole thing is a pretty obvious parable of WW2 with Eastman's character Vood as basically Hitler's caveman equivalent, though he goes around smashing things while his lady friend does all the talking for him.
I'm guessing that's what attracted him to the role of Rufus Excalibur Ffolkes, because though North Sea Hijack is a nice action, adventure film, it's nothing out of the ordinary.
Worse, the film, though short, drags.
Roger Moore sure shows his versatility as an actor in this film, He play a character though not very unlike his James Bond "persona" physically and intellectually , but quite different than his soave debonair character typical of the bond films.
I missed the start and came in only at the moustache-shaving scene, so, as I don't speak Italian or French I think it's a sign that it's a better film than it might appear that I understood and enjoyed it so much, though I thought it very sad.
I didn't recognise any of the actors ( though my wife tells me that the actress who played the mother is in the Lurpak ads ) so my understanding wasn't led by anything I might have expected from them.
I don't think it's a bad thing at all though as in an age where horror films are full of twists and turns, it's actually refreshing to see a straight-forward yet effective film that delivers.
it was a film that was absolutely perfect with not a mistake in sight!Oh so scary and frightening and hilarious rolled into one!But that goes for the experience at the movies1On DVD it lost that sense of scariness as the film is not knowing who is doing what and not knowing really what is going on.in the movies,you sit in darkness for 2 hours with up to 200 strangers.this added a sense of scariness to the film.that sense was lost on DVD.it still has the odd scare on DVDand is still hilarious but through out the film i felt a sense of loss.but i would still watch it over and over for entertainment value purely but to do with scare i don't think so.it might be different for people who ONLY saw it on DVD but for those in the UK and Ireland where it is still on release,see it in the cinema first.still highly recommended outside of movies though
It's not all about the gore or blood factor, it actually has some soul into it, though not a lot.
Oddly, when confronted, they have no recollection that he had one, even though the audience saw he had one and saw pictures of the man with the mustache!
We have to realize that even though there is so much that makes Disturbia unique, at heart it is a very commercial effort.
Even though there is nudity, and they want that R rating, they still had to cut back on the f***s and other rude language, but that's not what really held this film back.
So I can accept the weak ending, and I'll even accept the analysis of one of the user reviewers here, Richard Burke (or was it Robert) whose analysis struck me as completely reasonable and well though out, and thus accept that the movie more-or-less makes sense.
It plays like the Revenge of the Nerds, though not as intelligently, nor with the same amount of heart, but with a more modern spin.
Watch "Clerks" first (even though this one takes place first in chronological order).
Even though "Mallrats" is a more bigger and polished studio bound production of "Clerks" set in the mall, it just didn't take off at all.
But these things don't take away from sarcastic interplay and skits that are generated throughout the running time, even though it really seems like an eccentric melodrama with humorous overtones at times.
Also, a lot happened throughout the film even though it only takes place within a day and within the same mall, rather than Clerks which was slow moving and downright boring in some parts.
A good contrast to Richard Linklater's/Eric Bogosian's Suburbia, though it's better than Suburbia in most ways.
This is Shannen Doherty's best role (mainly because she's hardly ever on screen;), Jason Lee's best role, and Jeremy London's best role (not to be confused with twin brother Jason who was the awesome Randall Pink Floyd in Dazed and Confused...though Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams were both in Dazed as well...)  Look for an amusing role played by Ethan Suplee (Seth in American History X)  Overall: this film just plain rocks!
The filmmakers do an exceptional job not only of following Wild Man Fischer around and documenting his various moods and behaviors, but they manage to get access to many people who have known or worked with Larry in the past and get their takes on different events (I do wish though that Dr. Demento had been encouraged to sit up for his interview - he reclines on his side with his head propped up for the duration of his interview while duded out in his Dr. D outfit - complete with top hat - it's distracting and makes him look like a pretentious doofus).
The twists in the second half of the film, though motivated and logical, were too redolent of Twin Peaks for me, so much that it detracted from my experience of Lake Mungo.
The atmosphere is really dense and even though you barely see anything than blurry photos I was pretty creeped out in the first half of the movie.
though I have read a few reviews that hated this DVD because of the   changes what not in the film or score, but I think the f.b.i had something to do with this, so its the politics of DVD they should be upset with.
This flusters the jewel thief enough to make him lose his edge and get captured though he manages to fire his gun before being rushed.
Selecting his ex-con cohorts by means of making them display their muscles (not especially their skills) is rather perplexing, though it works for the movie.
Both are nasty and self-righteous, though down deep the preacher (Walter Huston) is ALL MAN (hubba, hubba)!
I did, even though I was no fan of hers.
There is evidence that he did, though, and somebody outside Marc's circle of friends confirms it, but other things change; his friends seem to disappear, his father (who called that very day) is said to be dead, his childhood home seems to never have existed... what is the truth?
It does not have a definite resolution, though, so anyone who cannot stand that is already warned.
The first talkie of the classic Jeanne Eagels' play "Rain", it was effective in every way even though it uses many old-time editing cuts and inserts.
Maybe..it is very interesting and pretty darn good though, even though you never really know what you've just witnessed.
Every characters has its own strong personality and they are what make this movie always interesting and never boring to follow, even though the pace itself isn't always terribly high.
The ending, though probably not all too surprising, is the highlight of the picture and contains a great deal of melancholy.
Beware though, this is definitely not a film for children!
I'll give the movie credit, though Â it's actually not much worse than most of the rest of its ilk.
Seth Green is the best and most believable character in this movie (though I can't deny Colms as he is a legend among films of this genre).
Crazy girls don't count though, right?
Alas, those eager to see Alice Cooper, he was only in it for a brief moment, though the special features claim he was a valuable asset to the production.
Rather disappointingly though, the atmosphere never builds dense enough to support the story.
Beth Bates is, to be quite honest, pretty bad performance wise (though gorgeous in my humble opinion).
Still pretty shocking in one spot though.
The best Sherlock Holmes films tend to be the ones with a horror element (such as The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Scarlet Claw), but even though this one offers nothing in the way of horror; it still manages to present an excellent mystery for Holmes to unravel.
Maybe it was just the cold that I have, though.
I appreciate that they did not have to use fowl language and even though Hilda shows "some" bosom, It is not overly used.
It also was actually a good whodunit movie even though that was exactly what this movie was trying to spoof to a certain degree.
The staff consists of various "freaks", all looking as though they are characters from a "fun house".
There are though, in this ingeniously structured and passionately filmed movie, some easily detectable themes.
Even though at the time I wasn't old enough to get all the jokes, It still had a magic around it that was clearly evident.
"Ultra Warrior" is particularly bad, though, because the plot and all the exposition exists simply to hold together bits of other movies.
It is amusing, though.
Very exciting, though I don't see how a mere ceiling fan is cause for that much alarm.
Not a movie for harsh critics though.
I especially liked his role in the movie even though he was a train robber and killed nearly everyone he met.
I thought it was cruel how he tried to kill his brother and sister though.
Again contrast this with the treatment of the Crusades where it is referred to as the Christian army (not European/French/Italian) even though the majority were mercenaries and Christian only because they were born in Europe.
The Bajorans, as a Federation protectorate, allows the Federation to control the station, though they have their officers there (including the hot-tempered Major Kira Nerys).
The Bajorans, as a Federation protectorate, allows the Federation to control the station, though they have their officers there (including the hot-tempered Major Kira Nerys).
The Bajorans, as a Federation protectorate, allows the Federation to control the station, though they have their officers there (including the hot-tempered Major Kira Nerys).
When reading the reviews, I agreed with Neil Doyle's, though I felt he was still way too kind to this incredibly annoying and stupid film.
Zelaney's book, though not his best, was a good read.
Movies like this did him in (though he would bounce back nicely the next year in "Hooper" with Burt Reynolds).
This movie has it all, cheesy effects(I will say that the weather effects were beyond top notch, though), classic acting(come on Jan-Michael Vincent and Paul Winfield?
This is one seriously incoherent mess of a film, and even though the 'Landmaster' truck still remains an ultra-cool method of transportation, the rest of the scenery and special effects are pathetic and not the least bit convincing.
All that remains of the book is the basic setting, the cross-post-apocalyptic-country road trip plot device (though with the book's suspenseful motivation for the trip replaced by a vague "let's see what's over there"), the "Run the storm or dig in?"
Instead of keeping this setting, though, the authors of this film decided to go with a world maybe a year or two after the bombs, which presents a much less interesting vantage than any of the time-points noted above.
The sky effects are indeed pretty neat-looking, and I'm sorry I didn't get to see them on the big screen, though the near-complete failure to try to maintain registration between moving (or even stationary!)
The truck is also pretty cool, though the stretchy material connecting the two halves looks comically flimsy in the harsh environments the truck rides through.
To describe my relation to Hook in just a few words: A fantastic movie, even though I've never been fascinated by the Peter Pan stories.
It's too bad, though, because this is a terrific flick.
At the end of Barrie's play, Wendy cannot return to Neverland, even though she would like to, because Neverland is reserved for children.
My problems with this movie, though, are minor, and I generally consider this a very good fantasy film for kids and adults--at least those of us who never quite grew up--alike.
Hook is undeniably a love or hate movie, but even after so long, I still like it, though I don't think I could call it a classic to be perfectly honest.
Hook is not a purely evil villain in this film, though.
Maybe because this is a film that I truly enjoyed, even though its flaws stuck out a mile when I started writing the review.
The main storyline is pretty interesting, though nothing particularly remarkable.
His Bruce Wayne voice isn't that great though, but hey he's an awesome Batman and that's all anyone really cares about.
Just seeing Hammil ham it up as the Joker is a blast, even though he doesn't appear (almost, one might think, as a lark) until halfway through the movie!
But it did, and presented a very though provoking thinking man's action thriller set in this age of cloak and dagger terrorism.
traitor has just been released in here..so i have just watched it..i found it on good intentions..especially surprised when i saw Steve martin's name as a writer..Don Cheadle was great..so Said was... but as a Muslim  being in mostly Muslim country(Turkey) i can easily understand there r many people are being used because of their faith..but most of Muslims have normal life..rare of them in those kind, though Islam; as every religion forbids to kill anyone even anything...the first important thing is being human...i know this, i can see this from here..but a European or a Japanese or an American person who has no knowledge or cultur about Islam what does he or she think?i accept as a Muslim we weren't able tell ourselves rightly to whole world but i think if Hollywood or the film makers want to seem pretty to Muslims or to understand and tell the world about real the Muslims, re-sit and re-think...when they r making films about Islam or Muslims; they should quit to write about agency, terrorism, bombs, poorness,weakness,revenge, sleeper agents.......etc..there r real Muslims never confirms because Ä±slam never confirms anything of these..normal lives r being lived...obey the rules..no "takÄ±yye"..its forbidden..its seem however u r..pls quit showing Muslim women ugly..as a good example look at Turkey..u can see really good looking but covered women...please read "Mevlana", "Said Nursi"..u will find great stories to take or adopt...please keep on taking films on this way so u can contribute the tolerate..understanding..
The ever-watchable Don Cheadle, who has turned in so many fine performances, here does it again, though he slightly overdoes the conscience-stricken angst (an emotion he has not yet learned to portray convincingly enough, perhaps because in real life he has not done anything bad enough to regret it sufficiently).
Some of the Arabs in the film do excellent jobs of acting, though it is a bit difficult to keep them straight, especially in retrospect.
This was a GREAT MOVIE for adults to see though.
Overall though the movie was alright with very good acting.
One of the crucial plot points is the true allegiance of his character, and it is the subtlety of his performance that will keep you guessing what side he is fighting for, though when the answer is finally revealed, you'll think you knew all along.
Guy Pearce delivers a winner of a show as well as the straight edge FBI agent chasing after Cheadle, though his character has been done to death, to be honest.
Neal McDonough is somewhat annoying in a supporting role as Pearce's partner (though I think Neal is annoying anyway...), while Jeff Daniels is a nice addition to the team.
Even though the majority of the characters appear to have nothing in common and no real relationship with each other, their true connections lie in their actions.
Pretty good work from the Coens as the theme and concept was neat and funny even though it may not be a critical success the star power of Pitt, Clooney, McDormand, Malkovich, and Swinton will make it a commercial success.
Even though Burn After Reading touts an "all star" cast consisting of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich, the two stand-out scenes that completely elevate the movie are scenes with J.K. Simmons and his CIA underling.
As for the rest of the cast it seems that the males got the funnier parts, Malkovich is great, Clooney is good (somewhat reminiscent of the character he played in O, Brother), while Frances McDormand could've been funnier (hear name is spot on though).
It had characters that seemed real, a ridiculous but interwoven plot that somehow was hilariously credible and side splitting humor all the way though.
All in all though he and the rest of the cast made me laugh.
Good one here indeed hence the 10 stars I'd give it even though it ain't win no Oscars or nothing of 'em nice awards.
In fact when you think about it even though you may fall out of your seat laughing in any scene (they normally require buildups which are rare in modern comedies) you are either laughing or smiling in this film.
total 7/10 (factoring in lowered expectations if you split his movie in clips it would make 3 great episodes of a comedy program clearly showing its stand-up heritage the whole package has a lesser impact though).
but you gotta laugh though.
but it's great though.
I won't go any deeper into the characters and their actors, I will say that they all did a good job though.
One thing that bothered me though was why Shandra got with B-Rad, it makes hardly any sense...it was bad romance on the writer's part.
This isn't a drama though, it's a comedy, so humor is where it matters.
One note though, they should've made Snoop Dogg's dialogue more like the way he really talks/raps...it seemed a bit "censored" to me...perhaps they did it to make the PG-13 cut.
Well, in Finland this movie is oddly called Executor, though that isn't a Finnish word.
Great premise, though a bit underbudgeted (what could one expect when it came to sci-fi on network tv back in 1986?
An excellent soundtrack also help this movie along even though its not needed.
I caught this on cable one night and decided to watch it and I enjoyed it...as a lightweight fantasy, though.
The animation for this film is decent, though sometimes Cinderella looks like a man and her head is too big.
The original is a timeless and inspiring Disney classic, with beautiful animation and songs, though I will admit it is not my favourite Disney movie.
I wish the mice had more screen time though, they were so cute in this one.
On the whole though, it is an above average and perfectly watchable movie, almost as good as the original, and a vast improvement over the second.
I mean, usually I have to slow down and pause the movie to see all the hysterically funny individual frames of the characters, but in this one, I saw amazingly exaggerated, hideous, hilarious things go right by on the screen, though we were obviously not supposed to notice.
I love the way she progresses and shows that though someone may come from a family of cold black hearts, that one person can still be warm and caring on the inside if given the chance.
Cinderella III also gives the character of the Prince a chance to develop (even though they still don't give him a name!)
Only small problem was the ending seemed a little bit hastily put together though, a little bit detracting.
I was expecting some cheesy romantic line here, but instead he goes, "Well, I still want to f*ck you...I sure as h*ll don't wanna f*ck Thelma anymore though!"
As a whole though, the film is not badly made.
But the point remains that in 1973 ciggie packets carried government health warnings and everyone knew of the dangers even though they didn't want to admit it .
They go in and work, even though they have to wear special masks, they're pretty safe.
(Films with a labour relations theme, such as 'Matewan' or 'The Molly Maguires', often have a historical setting, as though clashes between workers and employers were something from the Bad Old Days which have largely been overcome in modern society).
There is one thing about this game though that I find kinda odd though.
On the whole though it was just bad camera work, bad directing, poor script, feeble attempts to shock the audience and very little genuine authenticity.
There were a number of warrior women in 1st century Britain, though Boudica was the only one mentioned in history.
Alright, we don't know the names of Boudica's daughters, though they wouldn't have come out of Arthurian legends or even Wagner.
They had harps, though not those we know today, a variety of pipes, flutes and drums.
We don't know their tunes, though some might have been similar to early medieval or middle eastern type music rather than new age pseudo Native American dirges used in the film.
They had harps, though not those we know today, a variety of pipes and flutes and drums.
i don't think the Britons grew cabbages either, maybe mushrooms though I don't know.
It was an okay movie, Jeff Goldblum was not a good Ichabod though, but Butkus rocked.
Released two years after Aldrich's Kiss Me Deadly, MGiQ is the poorer man's version, though it has its own charms, mostly in the way of the LA settings and Bray's portrayal, tired and unshaven, but with the determination of a pit bull.
But it keeps its distance and doesn't glamorize him, either (though it does grant him his primitive 'code').
And the supersonic Maiden One plane looks absolutely stunning, even though it is 70's B-TV-movie material.
There are incredibly realistic settings and foreign languages that made me feel as though I were there.
When many first see this film, they will be surprised when they notice that it is a silent film even though made in 1931.
Oh, as for my guest, the honest-to-God prodigy: she said the music was magnificent (it was) even though a real musician could tell the actors weren't playing, it was well done.
I too saw this movie in the 80s, even though I was a child I could see that this was a special movie.
I doubt very much that it would every be released again, but I live in hope that the BBC or one of the Movie Channels will show it again (though usually of course, this happens at some obscure hour of the morning!)
It looks like it's going to play at a lot of festivals though, so I urge you to find it.
He's more than a little pusillanimous, really, though the parent-child bond is incredibly strong in Confucian China.
The film is wonderful as a source for pre-revolutionary China, though the pastoral scenes are mostly pretty much idealized.
For his audience, though, it's never a mystery.
The best parts, though, are all about the revelation of Blake's depth and what motivates him day to day.
If you watch the early scenes with Doomed FiancÃ© and Love Interest, you'll see that even though they're engaged and try to believe they're happy together, they're not.
Woodstock had a lot of rocking acts though, and if they were lucky, they even got to play within six hours of the announced time.
I do hope the one young lady who lost her sister in the crowd was successful in finding her, though.
Too bad that they didn't show Janis Joplin's performance, though.
It was well worth seeing, though.
The version to get of The Peach Girl is sold off the San Francisco Silent Film Festival website with the Donald Sosin soundtrack, a lovely one, though for some reason toward the end it sounds a bit warped in spots; I don't know why.
This print is gated correctly, though still a bit rough going in terms of visuals; the print has a lot of wear.
It is though we were watching a documentary.
If they can't even keep a straight face or tone of voice while making this, then why should I when I watch it, even though it's not meant to be comedy.
Even if you manage to look past all that and try to enjoy it for the fights, it still disappoints: no original moves, lousy stunt work and 'enemies suddenly distracting each other so the main character can get away, even though all exits are locked' are some of the things that come into mind.
I have to say though, I was disappointed with the movie on the whole and found it very tedious and at times wanted to leave the cinema.
But Razzle Dazzle is refreshing enough that you'll never think of it as a Guest ripoff, even though it fits right in.
The story is tighter, and the American lead actors were better than their Filipino counterparts...though I can't say the same for the supporting characters.
Bobby starts to see things, though, and these things aren't making any sense and they're a bit ghastly to boot.
Oh well, though.
Can't go with Kirby, though - think he's a real turnoff especially after he's filed sexual harassment charges.
Even though the advertisement's probably would not work in real life and would probably cause consumer outrage in this politically correct society we live in today,(e.g., Visit New York it's not as filthy as you think), it makes for some good laughs.
Even though, sometimes he is very strong and wanna control the life of Victory.
I do recommend it though, especially for a nice quiet evening with hot chocolate and other cozy features.
Both might be considered Italian Neo-realist films, though LA GRAND STRADA AZZURA does feature a big-name actor in the lead (Yves Montand) and a big budget--somethings that a Neo-realist film cannot have to be technically this type of film.
There are some quite glaring problems, though.
William Friedkin's Audio Commentary is a good listen, despite his tendency to describe the on-screen action (though almost always accentuated by his own interpretation of events); this was his favorite among the Lewton horrors - and, in fact, it's very much underrated among fans but, personally, I loved it immediately!
In the DVD Val Lewton Collection , Citizen Kane is mentioned frequently, both for its artistry and for its financial disappointment; (though I have read that in fact it turned a small profit.)
Recommended viewing for fans of this style of film, or for those who want to see a more subdued creature feature, though those who like more action-packed films seek caution.
Squarcio, though, like a "Sturm und Drang" character, relentlessly pursues a path his logic - and wife and children - tell him he should abandon.
The third movement focuses on Clo-Clo, and the castanets, though present, are used sparingly.
It seems like it would have been more interesting if that man (O'Keefe, playing it straight) had turned out to be the killer himself, but I guess that's maybe what the writers though the audience would expect.
Even though "Leopard Man" touched upon a lot of psychological aspects of the human, as well as animal, mind it pre-dates the movie "Spellbound" which many consider the first major Hollywood film about the subject by two years.
Edge has always been tremendous in the ring, and even though he faces off with the talentless Marc Mero, he still manages to put on a decent match.
Though Grace certainly appears to have fallen victim to those in the porn industry who only want to exploit her, and though she seems to have been effectively "castrated" by mainstream public perception of her, I don't think any of this makes her social/political observations less worthy of consideration.
This film will give you some very interesting things to see, and I don't mean naked women, even though there is plenty of that.
What you do get though is a look into the human condition; a condition that craves acceptance amongst peers, a condition that believes it is in control of its own destiny.
The film is pretty close to "School on Fire" even though it is not as fierce and pessimistic as that film which was made one year later.
It takes a long time for this movie to really get going, though part of this may stem from the fact I have been spoiled by other horror movies like "The Mist" and "Feast" that only take a short time before all hell breaks loose.
I did have a few ideas for a sequel, though: the disease is spread by kittens and victims transform into big, cuddly kittens that like to play and frolic instead of eating human flesh.
No, this is not another Pearl Harbor epic, though it comes as almost as big a surprise.
Though we never learn exactly what happened to Casey and how that affected her relationship with her father, it is apparent that the relationship is strained even though there is still love between the two.
I think the best horror stories are the ones where the audience feels as though they are secretly peeping into other peoples' worlds.
Even though the script reveals very few details regarding the lethal rat-virus, the chaotic situation in downtown Manhattan is eerily plausible and the overall atmosphere of "Mulberry Street" is tremendously menacing.
But it went off though so i could go.
Seems as though his "look" changes with each character he plays.
It is a pity, as the film is highly enjoyable - though unusual in many respects: it combines extremely funny scenes with very serious ones; there are practically two settings only: the street at night and the jail; and the cast is limited to seven players: two cameos (wizened Richard Hamilton, and intriguing Norman Reedus as the drowned man), two supporting ones (lovely Karen Sillas and seldom-seen Bruce Norris as the pair looking unsuccessfully for privacy); and three main roles : reliable William Sadler, excellent as the police sergeant; bland-faced promising Alessandro Nivola as the hero, and strikingly beautiful (and good actress) Brooke Langton, climaxing the film.
On the whole though, I think I mainly had a problem with what's not here.
Even though people tend to criticise the first, short part, it is quite interesting.
At first viewing I though this was the weakest of director Todd Solondz films, however like all of his works, it's impossible to forget once seen.
I felt I had gained little after it was over, though I will say that the concept and themes explored are quite interesting.
From what I understand, though, it's less provocative than the other films of Todd Solondz.
Anyway this is nitpicking, mostly the storyline is engrossing, even though the inclusion of the mole is really questionable.
To all people who like The Shawshank Redemption and people thinking that Tim Robbins actually saved his career with Shawshank Redemption (even though I've never seen the film): Tim Robbins ####ed up his career with this movie  The Only Reason I Gave It A 2 Is Because Unlike Most Book Movies It Didn't Spawn 8 Sequels (I'm Talking To You Harry Potter)
The directing is at times questionable though, there is little sense of pacing and there are some parts that feel tacked on (the crazy flumride anybody)just because its supposed to be a summerfranchie.
Its strenghs of this film mostly resides within the source material(witch i haven't read though).
The Builders, though, possess some forethought and, assuming that someday the surface will again be inhabitable, they enclosed specific instructions for the citizens of Ember to eventually escape to the sunlight.
It's very hard to care about the characters, likeable though they are, when every line of dialogue is punctuated by unnecessary pregnant pauses (a sure sign of incompetent direction).
Even though the two are matched as should be in good art craft.
To this films' credit, I did manage to sit through the whole thing - and there are a couple of interesting "ideas" (discussed more lucidly on the back cover of the video than onscreen) The main problem though is that the acting, suspense, and production values are no better than those of a "Brady Bunch" episode - or any other TV show of that vintage.
Don't expect it to ge a 'great movie' though, you will have to endure formulaic elements and shallow psychological insights.
In my opinion, he had a big depression, he was forced to go to the psychiatrist who happened to be his father's friend, he abused him and he wasn't able to talk about it with his father even though it seemed that he was a good father and was open to hear everything his son wanted to say The boy felt too bad and desperate that he prefer to die than to speak... On the other hand, there's people who told me that they think the boy was depressed and forced to go with his father's friend and when he started abusing him, he started to feel dirty but at the same time he liked it, so he got confussed by the feeling of being gay, that he commited suicide.
I really liked this movie maybe because I have always been interested about psycology (and not working in that field though I have always wanted..).
Here's the thing though.
When the movie was presented to us, the organizer said that even though the main character is dying, it's not a depressing movie.
In the screening I went to though, people seemed more shocked at the only violent scene in the film (that isn't mentioned in the films' rating) than the initially "controversial" sex scenes.
The sex though was done tastefully, it was over the top, and it was heartfelt.
Thanks to the MPAA though, a portion of the art-house audience won't be allowed to see this film.
As I said before, though, Lust, Caution is not about the love affair been characters played by the great Tony Leung and startling newcomer Wei Tang.
Either way, though, they have embedded themselves into the guerilla war and eventually find that they had no chance to turn back.
Instant results and instant gratification do not come easy, and even the finale I found to be less than satisfying, though it provided subtle avenues to keep your imagination running as to how the turn of events have greatly affected the usually cautious Mr Yee (Tony Leung).
Tony being Tony, I can't help but think that with his hair slicked back, and his stoic demeanor in well pressed suits, look the more vengeful version of his Mr Chow from In the Mood for Love, though this time round he really gets it on with another married woman Mrs Mak, Chia Chi's alter-ego.
LeeHom is rather wooden though as the de-factor youth leader, and his romantic moments with Tang Wei just falls flat given that it's not fully developed here, if not for the focus of love between Mr Yee and Mrs Mak.
Good luck finding this film, though, I think it is pretty rare.
The final one is the best though.
Most of the girls in the village have a crush on the handsome hunter Gaston (voice of Richard White), but he desires Belle.... even though she thinks he is nothing more than a brainless, muscle-headed fool.
Even though the young leading actors still have a lot to learn the movie has extraordinary supporting actors and also very good film editing and sound editing.
It shows a new format in Colombian films, the story is fresh even though it does deal with drugs, and the conflicts of the characters are perfectly plotted and put together into a delightful, artistic movie.
Would like to see it again for nostalgia's sake, though.
there are happy moments but it just shows the internal conflict every super group to follow must go though.
Even though it was obvious that the relations between The Beatles themselves were then too strained, they still blasted the gray Liverpool sky with that album.
This makes the sessions seem a little more loose though.
The Beatles are still a very popular act (even though they haven't really performed together since 1970) and this movie helps to debunk the moptop myth and shows two and a half very creative musicians creating songs still that people still enjoy listening to.
They don't explain anything, if I hadn't watched the Anthology Doc I wouldn't even have a clue why the hell they're in this big film studio, plus, I don't think John Lennon says more then three words in the whole film (Paul never seem to shut up though).
This, I thought, was good news even though I wasn't really aware that they had permanently split.
For someone though who's early life played to an ongoing soundtrack of Beatle songs, 'Let It Be' is a wistful, sad, occasionally funny, open yet closed look at our heroes as they make preparations for their own funeral.
At times this animosity boils over (though only occasionally in the released version; there are many more examples in the unreleased footage) such as the infamous exchange between Paul and George during a dispute over how George should play a guitar part.
I took two points off though, one for each of the two problems I have with it:   First, they didn't provide enough motivation or explanation for killing the models.
Overall though it's still a solid and enjoyable flick.
Overall: to a fan, a beautiful and sad account of a unique group of individuals struggling and failing against disintegration; this should also be essential viewing to fans of intelligent pop/rock music who might have sometimes wondered where U2, Bon Jovi, Kings Of Leon et al came from Â so far though, this was the artistic pinnacle.
All though the plot is a bit miss-guiding, this movie was great.
(though I enjoyed seeing John Savage from 'Hair' ...ect)  The second half I guess there were a couple giggles.
What there does seem to be alot of though, are ignorant movie-watchers who cannot bear that their little PC shibboleths would be the object of scorn and satire.
The movie can't really be called a comedy (though it is very funny) and it can't really be called a drama (but there is plenty of that).
Essentially, it's like saying that "Empire Records" was an accurate representation of mid-90's sub-culture - though in its defense it had decent acting and a fairly believable script.
This movie has depth that some people might not be able to see...and even though sometimes it might get slow maybe they did it on purpose for you to reflect or so you can say yeah I'm not just watching another mindless movie.
It is a funny movie though, as long as you are keeping in mind that this is only the director's second film and everyone has to start somewhere.
His lack of balance is actually a bit scary insofar as others, such as Hannity and Colmes, O'Reilly, Wolf Blitzer, and even Chris Matthews (though not lately), have proponents of the other side to at least discuss a particular matter with.
Judging by his ratings, it seems as though even the left is bored with this nonsense.
Olbermann makes his show into fun satire and moments of levity following the first half just the typical lot (though an interesting lot usually) of talking heads, with his "Best Person" and "Worst Person" listing, Oddball moments (videos of crazy Santa's or deer jumping over a car as it's driving, among many, many, many other classic bits that most often would be left in the dregs of you-tube).
Go to Rush, or Bill O'Reilly's show and you will find nothing but baseless claims, aimed at destroying freedom of speech, freedom of though and the American Way.
In most cases the actors stand up well to their counterparts though Rosemary de Camp in the Mary Astor mother role would perhaps not have been as effective as Astor at playing 'bad' as Astor did in The Maltese Falcon.
The big weak spot, though, is in the intertitles.
Great music, lovely period costumes, wonderful locations and nifty castles--it sure looked wonderful (though the castles used were all built much too late for the time period in the film--gosh, that history teacher in me is rearing up its ugly head again).
The actors, though often accomplished, are not at their best here.
Lets say that though Megalodon has a cool idea (prehistoric shark comes out of a fissure that gets opened up leading to a deeper underwater prehistoric ocean), the movie blows big time.
But I can honestly say I had never laughed so hard at people being chewed up by this incredibly big shark which looked as though it was used from a completely different film.
I should, though, pay my respect to the actors, that didn't suck, even though the directing, the images and the script were totally under any level of tolerance.
All the characters are developed in such a way that we empathize with them even though some are a bit absurd, such as the dancer who wants to be a comedian but just isn't funny (played here by Paul Draper and on Broadway by Gene Kelly) and a black man (Reginald Beane) who's astonished at the mere idea of being paid to play piano.
Personal taste will have to determine the picture's ultimate value, though Cagney's low-keyed self-assurance (some may say smugness) is rather enjoyable--and his presence is certainly odd in these corny circumstances.
Oddly enough, although the bar is a nice neighborhood one, Howard Freeman and Natalie Schaefer go to the bar (they are wealthy people) as though they are slumming.
Obviously, though, the movie was made by David Cronenberg, master of venereal or bio- horror.
The Fly is a fantastic piece of film-making that should appeal to those in the mood for a taut horror flick or an intelligent, though coded, exploration of an interesting idea.
This film is beautiful and even though the basic genre is horror this film plays out one of the greatest love stories played out in film history.
It's probably also the reason why this movie is regarded by many as an of the best horror movies of all time, even though the entire movie itself isn't really an horror movie at all in my opinion.
Not many films can give you an ending where you may be as moved/saddened as you might be repulsed by the gore (you've gotta admit, though, that gore is extremely well done).
We also get to see undoubtedly Jeff Goldblum's best performance playing Seth Brundle in not a too dissimilar way that Tom Baker played The Doctor in DOCTOR WHO though it's fairly obvious that when Brundle does gymnastics it's a body double since the camera never focuses on Brundle's face .
He tests this invention with animals and objects until one night he gets very mad because he believes his girlfriend (Geena Davis) is seeing someone else (John Getz), even though his belief is wrong.
Even though, yes, it can be a bit much to watch with all that, eew, vomiting.
I have to admit one thing though.
So it's obvious with better direction (sorry, Curtiz just doesn't have it here, though he was usually a wonderful director--particularly in romances and adventure films) and writing this SHOULD have been a lot better considering the money Warner Brothers spent to bring all these stars together.
Be prepared though for a Karloff you haven't seen before, all the while I just couldn't get used to seeing him in a military uniform with curly hair.
Even though Lewton was a mere producer he co-wrote this one along with the two other Karloff film.
Every now and then though I find a rating that just absolutely mystifies me.
By today's standards, there's not much to be scared of here, and though it works up a nice head of steam near the end, it succeeds more as a mood piece than a horror tale.
This is definitely one of my favorite things of all time to watch--what does it for me, though, is the style and synchronization of the various 50's pop songs that are deliciously sprinkled throughout the movie---simply fantastic-----they blend well with the story and its characters and you are always pleasantly surprised when a new song just pops out of someone's mouth at the (sometimes) most inopportune time.
Samuel L. Jackson (character Jack Friar) is believable, though not one of his better movies.
The themes include a robbery plan that goes awry though here it is more of a con rather than robbery and it is executed without resorting to violence.
As a kept girl with ten percent rebate on pedicure expense, though she is cunning in some scenes , but she is also deadly frightened.
I though thats was so COOL!
This movie heralded the "introduction" of bona fide Australian adonis Antony Hamilton, though he had done television and a low budget cult film, "Nocturna" previously.
Hamilton in various stages of undress is the only reason to watch this film -- which is a good enough one -- though in the version I saw some of the body parts were vaselined out.
This is a formulaic film that is very reminiscent of many of Clark Gable's films of the era (particularly SAN FRANCISCO) as well as the crime dramas that made Warner Brothers so popular in the 1930s--though this film IS from MGM.
Gable becomes increasingly ruthless, though the two remain devoted friends.
Christian Bale was adorable, though.
The two actors were great though, their performances were definitely okay.
Due to boredom one night and the encouragement of having watched a string of quite interesting though often unusual Korean films i found myself a fan of Korean entertainment.
The movie is funny, though maybe not as laugh-out-loud-hillarious as a pure comedy would be, and allthough the plot is pretty crap (with some really far fetched sollutions), all in all it's a movie well worth seeing (unless you have a thing against pretty female faces...).
It isn't as though this couldn't have been penned by him -- the Sadean delicacy is all over the place, demanding to be seen, savored, and digested.
Its bad part, though, is that close to the end you keep expecting the movie to end and it doesn't.
One thing that is very annoying though is that when i rented it today the cover said "1:a pÃ¥ biotoppen" (number one at the boxoffice (which almost maid me NOT rent it)) which is funny as the movie has only 86 votes here.
Others were quite good though.
Overall pretty good, could have been better though.
It involves the story of Charlie Brown,who invites to Thanksgiving dinner the rest of the gang which includes Peppermint Patty,her best friend Marcy,Franklin (the only African-American character on the show),Linus and his sister Lucy,and others to Charlie's house for Thanksgiving dinner even though the Brown family has other plans.
Needless to say the rest of the Peanuts gang are far from impressed with the menu, though that doesn't stop Peppermint Patty putting the moves on Chuck.
Even if thats not your style of humor I recommend you check out this movie just as a refreshing change from the typical Hollywood style  Most important though, just have fun with this film; I have read reviews that try to analyze and put meaning to the different events of this film.
A real masterpiece, though some might only like it, but not love it, as i do ... well, too bad!
Even though he fails every time, he just repeats the same thing over and over again without thinking.
(Even though Linda seems lovely - her character is portrayed as once having been a gold-digger who only married Andy when he was rich and famous and left him for a more prosperous gentleman when he was down on his luck).
It's as though life has really ceased to have meaning for the Champ ever since he lost his championship status.
Wallace Beery's not bad (though a bit stilted) in the leading role; he's better than Irene Rich, playing his ex-wife, who throws herself around the screen, swooning from sofa to sofa in a totally over-acted performance.
Beery's work is quite good here, but Jackie Cooper's remarkable, potent chops steal the show - and your heart; though 'The Champ' has a good many fine, classical attributes there's none better in it than Cooper's unforgettable performance.
Andy is released from jail (thanks to Tony & Linda)and gets a bout with the Mexican heavyweight champ, where Dink runs back to his father to watch him hopefully win the fight, even though he is out of shape and not at the level of his opponent.
I felt as though I were sitting next to Monet, watching as he effortlessly splashed brilliant watercolors across his canvas.
If you love art & music, sunshine & poetry than you are qualified for seeing this movie, be warned though...this movie can change your life (and maybe..it will ;-)!
Oh, and Sid Caesar did a couple of things which may be construed as humor, though that is certainly a subjective construct.
Eventually I did get around to see it, though a small TV never does a film the same justice a theater does, and being a bit sceptic about the small hype this movie caused made me prejudice about it, but I must say I have never been so wrong before.
Everyone manages to make the most out of their role and even though we only get to know some of them briefly they come alive just as much as Amelie herself does.
I had the great joy of watching David Lean's MADELEINE(1950)for the first time ever on TCM early this morning, and can say without any reservations that though it is one of the great director's lesser-known works, but it is by no means lesser in either acting or direction.
Ann Todd is a good actress, though an internalized one who comes off as rather cold.
I will say this about it though they did use a creative way to get the bomb in a tv studio.That was about the only memorable event in the whole movie.
I loved the trailer for this movie because it looked interesting and funny.I really liked the 2 leads Nick Nolte and Trevor Morgan.They work really well together and I could easily see them working together in other movies.I liked the relationship they built.Ray was estranged from his own son for reasons we don't know and David looked to Ray as a father figure since his own dad couldn't be there for him because of a disability.It isn't uncommon for males to bond this way whether it be platonic or not.Throughout history older men have often had younger male companions.Unfortunately society nowadays has to put their ugly spin on it and make assumptions.Even in the movie David's younger friends ridiculed him about spending time with the older ump even though there was nothing happening except they were developing a friendship and Dave was like a son to Ray, and I think Dave looked up to Ray and respected him and later obviously really cared about him.The only problem with this movie I had was their relationship was over as quick as it began, and it seemed there was way too much more that had to be done and said.I agree with what another person said about why even mention Dave's mother since she wasn't even in the movie period.None of her absence made sense and wasn't explained well or explored at all.Also the 2 kids turned out remarkably well for having a disabled dad and being abandoned by their mother.I didn't find that believable.And then there was this whole back story about Ray's past that got thrown in and also not explored.If these missing characters were in the movie it would be easier to understand the characters better and understand how they ended up being so broken.I mean for Chris'sakes!
In the end, ignoring all of the poor technical aspects of the film, it's still watchable and may be enjoyable to fans of the normal 'teen/college' (though many were way, WAY above teen and only pretending to be young) slasher flicks.
Vigdis Anholt, who I discovered is from Norway (I though I detected an accent) as well as David Morwick (a former model for Talbot's) and Brandon Johnson (who got his start on a soap opera) are all great.
Seriously though, this is a great film... great music, actors, scenery yadda yadda...
There's one good thing about it though, without the start and end-credits the movie is only about 70 minutes long.
I must admit though I also watched it with commentary on and its even, their super funny and you can tell they really enjoyed each other.
Like with most of the fans of this movie,I fairly enjoyed it,as a guy -I enjoyed the eye-candy..Especially Sofi'a,even though she emulated that "cuchi-cuchi" Charo style,with her comical antics and Sofi'a over doing her hot and sexy colombian accent!!
Because this movie was directed by a woman,this was a light screwball comedy..the story was simple,the comedy tame,lot of silly clichÃ©'s(especially for Sofi'a)and the acting was OK,though I was surprised at Sofi'a's comedy timing,since she never had any training at acting!
Overall though, I thought the three women together were mediocre.
Ultimately, though, despite the three hours running time, I walked away unsatisfied, defeated by the film's ambition.
As Jez, Townsend does a fine job, too, and though he's overshadowed a bit by Dylan-- intentionally the flashier of the two-- Jez is the one who secures the sympathy of the audience.
For Cotter to be attracted to her didn't require much of a stretch though, he was as much a womanizer as a maniac.
Even though a modern day remake of the film would find a way to eliminate those pesky plot points, I'm not sure you'll ever find a better gangster to take a powder on screen than Cagney's death scene here, in an ode to the movie's title; it was brilliant.
I wonder though, if an earlier line uttered by an off screen elevator operator was meant to reference Cotter's ultimate fate when he asked - "Going down?"
It could well be an Hispano Suiza though.
What I can say though is that it can decelerate from 110mph to 20mph in half a second (ha!
I agree that it is a great film though.
The sex is gritty just like the atmosphere though it well filmed and largely very erotic also.
I must say though that I still enjoy watching older Franco movies better than the newer ones, that he is still making this present day and age.
I've yet to see an erotic moment in any of his films (though the moments in this one are probably the least annoying of his I've seen) and most of the naked women he's used aren't all that attractive either (although again, to be fair the women in this movie are about the best I've seen in a Franco film), so no real reprieve there.
I only remember some scenes with cloaked individuals walking slowly as though in some kind of procession.
The film was shot at Ibsley (now no longer in existence either as a base or a beacon, though you can see the remnants) which was in Hampshire, and in 1942 an active fighter station.
If the bell went to scramble, filming would temporarily be halted while those airmen would run to their spitfires, go off and fight the war, before returning and carry on filming as though nothing had happened.
I personally found the reconciliation scene of Lara's Father and his sister very touching (though a bit too quick).
Of course Al-Quada exists, and of course they planned 9/11 and executed it - even though you conspiracy theorists wants it to be Americans.
Funny thing though: the people that hate this movie all have much text to explain why this movie is flawed and full of lies.
This so-called "documentary", tries to "document" that George Bush and CIA planned 9/11, and that no Muslim would or could ever blow himself up in a suicide-attack (though they do everyday in Iraq).
Many conspiracy theorists believed that USA or others planned 9/11, even though they had not examined the subject - it was their prejudge, that USA or Jews are behind every bad thing happening in human history, from the biblical-flood, to the plague in the middle-ages to finally 9/11.
Even though Dylan, Jason and Korey claim that they have spent 3 years researching 9/11, they still got a lot of facts wrong:  1.
Worst of all though, despite pleas to the contrary Loose Change is an insult to the memories of those who died, those who mourn them, and those who struggled to save lives.
Some of the acting left a lot to be desired though.
This film is essentially a blend of American Pie and Alien, though there were some great camera-work for the attack scenes and there were some good performances, but this movie seemed as thought it was just another teen horror flick.
Even though Decoys might have a somewhat glossy look there's very little substance here below it.
The acting is alright but nothing special from no-one I have ever heard of, some of the college girls are pretty hot though.
It's clear to see who the lead players are and even though you know who's gonna go, you still root for them like they have a chance, something you don't see too often.
But for most of the action sequences the creatures are CGI but even though it's easy to tell, it still looks good since they move so fast.
If you get a chance give this one a watch, even though you may have seen this type of story before, it's more fun then you may think.
It's fun to watch, even though you know how it's probably going to turn out in the end.
The writing is quite good and even though there requires a certain suspension of disbelief in the plot, the characters remain true to form.
So, even though this movie takes us through some familiar territory, I still thought it was a lovely ride.
Jessica Lange full marks to you though a great role in a good film of the 90's where it may show what some mothers inlaws are actually like, no offence
Not good enough to actually throw the shots he was supposed to throw in the movie, though.
Saw it before, and watched it again last night, even though I normally don't watch films twice.
The humour in it is great, even though I knew what was coming.
Even though Lighthouse doesn't exactly deliver a story that anyone would consider as original (some people are stalked by a merciless serial killer on a deserted lighthouse), it is a surprisingly watchable movie.
Even though people are killed by having there throats cuts there's never any blood stains on the floor - just on light bulbs or toilet bowls  Why is everyone so stupid ...
I'll run away for ten seconds then not be able to find my way back, even though I have a torch and a radio.
This had all the gore you need, maybe it could of had more, but still has a bloody edge, and the effects wern't all the terrible, even though towards the end when the woman is being grabbed by her hair when she's hanging off the Lighhouse does look a little bit stupid.
It is good that IMDb lets us fans research this, though.
By the way, the China edition in the green box has bonus materials of interview with some of the cast members as well as the last 7 days of filming -- even though there is no English subtitle on the bonus materials, it was still quite enjoyable to see how the cast looked in "modern" attire and their reaction to the questions!
Even though Carrie's part was small, she continued to be impressive with her subtle portrayal of a character difficult to portray, in that it was a character that could easily be "overdone."
No animal cruelty though - the car wreck that introduces Lucky excepted.
I didn't like the ending though, only because Sam Neill's character didn't end up with Rebecca (Olivia Hussey), which was really sad.
Between Rebecca and Rowena, I think Rebecca stole the movie because of her courage and will to help Ivanhoe even though they have different backgrounds.
The jousting is wicked cool though.
There were a few somewhat notable actors in this film though which causes me to wonder what they were thinking since there is no way this job landed them a big, fat paycheck.
I felt for the guy even though it was only a film.
Surprisingly enough though, unlike many other movies ridiculed by Mike and the bots, this one is far from bad.
Another would be the way that the future was unaltered even though automatic weapons and the wreckage of a plane/time machine were left in Revolutionary War-era America.
Honestly though, I believe that these shortcomings were inevitable given the budgetary constraints of the film.
He is good at getting beaten down though, which happens in this movie a lot.
This one was fun to watch, even though it is strictly fodder for the folks at Best Brains.
Time Chasers is probably one of the better movies on MST3K, though the competition isn't too tough.
I suppose that's how you get a great crap cast though...After the sex, Brinke goes to her job at the radio station and is provoked into telling how all of mankind will be dead in so many hours.
Big-chinned hero and reporter girlfriend try to change the future and in a series of events too painful (and not horribly important, though including one version of girlfriend Lisa getting killed and a duplicate Nick coming into the picture) to recount, they along with JK, flunky Pink Boy and garage mechanic end up in 1777 Vermont.
All in all, Tangents falls in the same general category of MST3Ked films as Overdrawn at the Memory Bank; a small budget film that is ridiculous enough on its own merits to make it a decent watch for lovers of pure cheese (though, as always, I recommend watching the MST3K version instead).
