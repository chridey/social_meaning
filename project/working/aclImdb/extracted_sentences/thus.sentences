They're nice, atmospheric corridors, though, thus rarely repetitive, and Prey also avoids Doom 3's problematic love of dark spaces, something it references in one of several humorous moments.
One of the better gay-themed dramas from recent years, GET REAL follows a well-established formula (identified in some of the other posts here), and thus is a bit short on originality, but does feature some fine performances, and - in subtle ways - does manage to touch upon other issues which help to cut through the rose-colored romance that frames much of the story.
These qualities give the characters depth and, thus, add to the realism and tension.

The movie was slow to find it's footing and much time was wasted as Grant and Dunn, in the slower portions, are not on camera together and thus unable to `duel.'
Surprisingly fresh for a relatively unknown director , perhaps , the best ultra-real action film of the year , 1000% better then self-proclaimed pure action like Wanted !A story of an abduction of the US president , played by great W. Hurt, is somehow reminiscent of the following genre of macabre war thrillers : The Domino Principle , The Parallax View , Enemy of the State , except that it is told from different perspectives, thus the title !
I found the move to be extremely believable Â and thus gripping and fascinating to the last frame.
The film is told from multiple viewpoints and the events that transpire within a 23-minute time frame, thus a Groundhog Day-like experience.
In Mike and the 'bots' hands, of course, the film transcends its crappy premise (and thus the ten-star rating).

I've been especially interested in the early history of motion pictures and have spent much time with the LumiÃ¨re brothers' films; thus, this project becomes more rewarding for me.
Where the troubled history between Verdegast and Poelzig comes to light and thus spells immense danger for the newly married Allison's.
Even with the rules thus outlined, Ladd still has a chance to present his standard beguiling bad guy early in the film, merely holding back a victorious smile as he pretends confusion over the elder Lavery's excited reaction to his birthmarkÂ   Besides its other values, "Branded" is a visual delightÂ In fact, the movie's one drawback as a Western entertainment is a lack of big action highlightsÂ
As usual for Italian genre movies, the music score is an asset and here it is provided by Stelvio Cipriani whose motif, while simple and repetitive, is extremely effective given that it involves children singing gibberish (and thus commenting on the main theme of the movie itself even through its performers).

'Memories in the mist'by Dasgupta artistically and metaphorically inter-wovens the memories and fantasies of a man of his beloved and lost father.Set in the backdrop of North Kolkata,the story paces to and fro between past and present,between reality and imagination,between innocence and lucre!Amongst the numerous metaphors used in the movie,the one which cant be helped mentioning is the reference of the piper which beckons the man to his past,his childhood and his unfulfilled dreams.With this movie,Dasgupta has also endeavored to find the base of our relationships.At the end of the film,the man reveals himself to his father and thus to the audience,and thus forces us to remind of Apu who would,despite hostility as conferred by fate,love and wonder!That is probably the reason some critic has mentioned it as'the closest modern equivalent'to a Ray movie.But whatever international applaud it gets,it may not get along too well with the Bengali audience because of its sheer lack of bangaliyana(Bengali traditions and customs)as compared to a new wave cinema by Ray or Ghatak.

But unfortunately, Godzilla's DNA overtook the alien's shape and causes a painful Hulk-like transformation, thus Orga (named from "Organizer G1" - Get it?)

Ghost World's witty appraisal of 'America' successfully avoids being childishly caustic or self-important and thus emerges as one of the best films of 2001.

The picture is a costume drama with action,suspense,romance,adventures,tension and formidable interpretation.It's a romantic story with exciting images narrated with amazing agility and swiftly,thus murders,storms,shipwrecks,escapes,pursuits..The film along with Â¨Walzes from ViennaÂ¨(1934)and Â¨Under CapricornÂ¨(1949) is one from trio Hitchcock's epoch tale.And is the first of Daphne of Maurier adaptations along with Â¨RebecaÂ¨and Â¨The birdsÂ¨.
Frame images thus become a series of diagonal straight lines and curves.
But de Leon, along with Romero (the Blood Island trilogy, The Walls Of Hell), was a classically trained filmmaker and is enshrined as a Philippines National Artist, and thus everything he does is with purpose, from the masterful framing, composition, lightingÂ As a result, Curse Of The Vampires is not just a throwaway B-programmer with bloodsuckers but a serious horror film with deep cultural resonances.
The quaintly timeless English ambiance, and the consistent theme of it maintaining its spry morale, is a clever and natural juxtaposition to the taut aggression of the conflict, which is thus more well-defined.

However, while certainly lighthearted in comparison with Corbucci's DJANGO (1966; which I should revisit again in a couple of days) and especially THE GREAT SILENCE (1968), it's a more balanced proposition than COMPANEROS (particularly with respect to Palance's performance - quietly menacing here as opposed to the campiness of the later film) and, thus, superior to it in practically every way.
It was kinda cult and thus shown quite often and the audience could have been always the same.

California at that time was totally isolated, and would get the news from the government many months later, thus many people would be for secession, because they did not believe they could be governed like that.
To start with, there's something inherently self-defeating and pointless in constructing a narrative from two widely conflicting viewpoints - a la "Rashomon" - when one of the supposed eyewitnesses is already dead and, thus, unable to personally relate his side of the story.
The film is decidedly anti-war, rendering it a soulless and empty experience if a young man's coming of age adventures are explored on the travels he makes inbetween exploits of a combative ilk, and thus gradually informing us that any prior 'dread' we may have had in what to expect from this period Soviet piece, was unnecessary.
Without much to go on, he heads to Los Angeles to track down Cravat and thus himself.
Easily the most disappointing Lenzi-film I've seen thus far.

Again some of the scenes could have been shorter, thus (theoretically) making The Enforcer a much tighter package.

Most people would probably just recognize the former and thus miss out on some unique creations.
Harvey Weinstein famously used to buy up foreign films and then would refuse to distribute them to American theaters, thus reducing competition in the arthouses for the films he actually decided to release.
Although clearly the most historically accurate and interesting film on this subject made thus far, there were some liberties taken.
Just as Linda learns that she can derail herself entirely if she is not honest or tries to manipulate (trying to control others or their feelings with her bag of tricks whilst living in disguise from and thus not owning herself), so others learn how easy it is to kid themselves into thinking they've found the elusive 'peace' or 'simplicity' which they perceive in an ostensibly uncomplicated lover who then proves suicidal, or other escapist plan which goes awry.
And the voices of this realization come in some curious packages (further fleshing out the wisdom-where-you-least-expect-it notion whose fascinating messenger in Nobody Loves Me was the voice of a marginalized, lovelorn but lovingly unselfish transvestite): here an overweight chef who is blissfully married to his young-love sweetheart with a passion for her soul that knows no parameters or criteria but is unabashedly unconditional, a Spaniard who refuses to indulge his German girlfriend's need to hear spurious pledges of eternal love, the errant husband/father who seizes the moment to respectfully respond to Linda until her deception forces him to draw his line in the sand and thus startles her back to self-acceptance, another errant husband/father whose Caribbean indulgences have actualized his spirit of "to dance is to live" and who finally lures down the encrusted wall behind which his wife has been taking sullen refuge.

Overly picky critics may think themselves clever in pointing out the time-travel flaws in Frequency, but these are slips that the writers obviously knew about; it's assumed that the viewer will take a leap of faith fairly early on, and thus the movie is able to build an interesting plot from the premise of a "magic" radio.
It's certainly one of the best films of the year thus far.
From the reviews I've read thus far it seems I was one of the few who felt this way.
As far as film and television media is concerned I am limited in terms of critical commentary by the fact that I don't watch television (I've never owned a television set) and thus see most movies either on the big screen or on my computer screen.

The long winding title ' Yun Hota Toh Kya Hota'( which can be translated as "What if it had happened thus?')
What's so different about this romantic/fantasy dark comedy is it that uses the British (and European at that - it was set in Euro 1996) enthusiastic obsession with soccer as a backdrop, and thus provides an emotionally dramatic fantasy setting of 'what ifs' and anticipation for the main drama of quirky romance.
Cena won and thus making Edge the "Transitional Champion" he did not want to be known as.
This film should be thus regarded as fantasy.
By helping each other out they discover the true meaning of friendship and start evaluation the way their lives are progressing thus far and where things went wrong for them and they let the 'good old times' revive as well.
He gets something bigger than what he bargained for, thus putting in peril his own relationship with Liv.
Easily one of the worst of the second crop of "8 films to die for" that I've seen thus far (I've seen 4 of them including this)   Eye Candy: Malea Richardson provides the T&A   My Grade: D-
Since Don Coscarelli shot so much unused footage for the original Phantasm film he incorporates some of it into the story, thus heightening the already warped space-time continuum the Phantasm universe exists in.
There's a disconnect emotionally that is left open, thus, going into the second half of the film, where finally we see what some of us would be waiting for: the serial killer plot.
Wanting to get Louie out of retirement and thus, with him back in charge, save what's still left of the organization two of his former colleagues the Midget and his partner in crime Gimpy try to kidnap little Jackie.
The editor, Lisa Donette May, is another culprit for the catastrophe that is HRH through neglecting to control the finished state of this movie: there are so many pointless scenes where nothing happens and thus slow down a no-go film.
The original film gives us a Jack Carter who will attack or kill anyone he suspects was part of the murder of his brother thus turning it into a hate filled, vengeance fest.
the Matthau, but I laughed even as this absurd chapter came to a close...it's a product of an era when not only sex, but laughter and freedom, were celebrated and must be seen in that mindset...this is a movie that people who write certain modern movie guidebooks will never, ever, ever understand...for the simple reason that, in this era, as prurience increases, thus does narrowmindedness, so that we come to forget completely the now remote atmosphere in which such a film could be made.
He names the little creature Crusoe, who seems to grow larger everyday until he becomes so large he has to be put in the lake; thus becoming the legendary Lock Ness Monster.
There is one evident display of viciousness here on an isolated member of Schildkraut's treacherous army as a clutch of Muslim riders (appearing on the scene to rescue the cornered Wilcoxon at the instigation of Saladin himself, in the hope of thus winning Young's love) fall on him en masse with their spears.
Unknown to him and his bride is the fact that some other family members are determined to scare away Harold and his bride--and thus get the inheritance themselves.
Judy Landers, an 'It Girl' from the 80's (who's only claim to fame is being famous, much like Jenny McCarthy or Carmen Electra today)) makes a token appearance as a dumb blonde who Remo tries to have sex with, thus framing jokes about "lesson 36", the Sinanju method by which to drive women wild with sexual desire...  From the pilot, it appears that the series would have been the continuation of Remo's training by Chuin, with dangerous missions undertaken for Harold W. Smith as needed.
The characters are immediate and thus so real that you cannot but fail to be swept into the story.
The cast is splendid; the performances are exactly right, natural, and thus so realistic; there is no forced over-the-top stuff here.
The story follows a familiar pattern of fighting off various enemies for pieces of the jewel, and is thus quite predictable, lacking in complexity, and easy to lose interest in.
Teenage girl gets dragged into feudal japan and thus begins her adventure with a half demon/half human, a demon slayer, a monk and a demon child in gathering a sacred jewel shard scattered across the land.
In a sense, that is very true because it is told by the doctor who treated the inmates and thus forged friendships with the criminals.
To begin with, the plot is rather flimsy: boyfriend, American, and girlfriend, golden-haired Frenchwoman, are together for two years, start to get bored of their relationship, and thus decide to travel to Italy and visit the girl's parents in Paris.
Though Jethro's intent was apparently serious, this film is high camp and can be enjoyed thus: Treat it as a frat boy drinking game.
It's not hard to accept these people as small town residents, and thus the film is far better for it.
At the same time the characters don't seem like caricatures and thus they seem like real people who have been overcome by greed.
The people who have reviewed THE GRANNY here are obviously NOT horror movie fans, and thus should stick to reviewing films like FREE WILLY, PART 10.
When a shot Jason (in the form of a police officer) "unexpectedly" comes to life and grabs a woman's leg, we see his eyes open several moments before the "shock" grab, thus negating any suspense.
Also I thought that the actor Richard Ruccolo was clearly overacting, thus making his role less realistic.
The supporting cast includes Nestor Paiva (like Agar and producer William Alland, a BLACK LAGOON alumnus) as the hero's elderly companion, who's panic-stricken in the presence of this alternate universe, and soon ends up a victim of the 'Mole People' Â thus exposing the intruders' essential mortality!
This remains the best of the three versions to come thus far.
This film seems to support the idea that the average Mexican feels inferior to the average American, thus the need to make a film to emphasize the idea, by creating a pretend-world where the American begs for the Mexican to return.
Average guy Anthony Edwards takes a call in a public phone booth and discovers that the end of the world is terrifyingly near; thus begins a race against time as he must locate his girlfriend and get out of LA.
From the moment Harry tosses his lit cigarette and thus sets his part in the unfolding drama into motion, it's a heartpounding, heartbreaking ride to the inevitable conclusion.
When you are not free, then you have nothing else to lose thus you have to run after your freedom, however do not believe in freedom until you get what you used to have before losing it.
He attatches himself to the older son because he tries to emulate his father, and thus reads what books he's told are good, and passes those he's told are not; watches what movies his father likes while avoiding those his father doesn't; thinks and speaks how his father would, when it's obvious he knows almost nothing about what he's talking about.
The tennis coach's constant deployment of the suffix 'my brother' at the end of each of his sentences indicates his lack of linguistic sophistication and thus, we can infer, sophistication of thought.
Bernard's wife is thus understood as the principal antagonist, whilst the aforementioned frivolous characters, the tennis coach and the son's girlfriend, represent the uncaring and self-deluded universe in which Bernard is fated to exist.
And while the emphasis here--as in Anderson's "Royal Tenenbaums"--is a dysfunctional family, Baumbach wisely keeps us intimately invested in the small cast, thus tightening both the dramatic and comedic effect.
There is plenty of scenes depicting sharks being killed by people or each other and also the "sharks attacking human being" scenes are pretty dull and thus funny.
Tintorera is actually a sex/beach-flick, and thus perfectly captures the feel of the seventies take on sexual revolution; an era of hedonistic disco parties, sexual experimentation and short, loveless sexual encounters.
Two FBI agents, one a by-the-book fellow, the other a people smart man who was raised in Mississippi begin an investigation on it yet no one wants 'outsiders' around, thus trouble starts brewing.
never underestimate the ability of hackman and dafoe... that is the only thing that i can say.... we have seen a lot of movie involving hackman, and this is one of the greatest performance from him...don't ever judge the acting by comparing to his age..he will always be one of the greatest actor for all time...Willem dafoe is just like the underdog...sometimes he has given a very powerful acting in a movie,and it was proved by two movies...this one @ Mississippi burning..and American psycho..  thus to these performances...hackman was nominated for Oscar...he really deserves it !!
But there's a hitch, and that is that John's young, fast and loose daughter named Julie (Sagnier) frequents it rather often thus causing friction, disagreement and general strife.
There is a point, early on, in which Julie swims naked but the film does not offer a reaction shot on Sarah's behalf thus defusing any gaze.
He thus accomplishes the rather difficult task of creating a film that people will laugh at AND laugh with.
thus creating the competitive situation that fuels the film.
had been ridiculously togged up thus instead of Dorsey?
However, Mel Gibson isn't witty but painfully earnest, and thus his violent formula is disturbing rather than entertaining.
The Stranger successfully portrays the difficulty a logical, self aware man has living in an absurd conformist society thus encapsulating Camus' Existentialist philosophy.
One couple dares to violate this law and is sent to prison, and thus conflict ensues.
The central characters are John and Karen Brennick - a couple sent to the Fortress after she becomes pregnant with a second child, thus breaking a futuristic population control law.
These officers persevered in their dedication to birthing a powerful air force and they did it without losing their careers and thus their effectiveness (in that regard they mirrored young field grade officers such as George Patton and Dwight Eisenhower in their crusade to take the Army from the horse to the tank).
I won't go too thoroughly into the plot, but a man is basically tormented in different ways by a woman with shifting personalities (thus the two actresses).
The boss enemies are fun, for one immediately obvious reason, but the explanation behind them(and thus, how compelling a presence they are) just doesn't measure up to that of the first... even if there are far, far more of them.
On the whole, the movie had a dark sort of feel toward it and thus not as upbeat as Jet's previous Hollywood outing, " Romeo must die ".
And YES, I also agree that likely the main culprit here was the director (thus like CA said, not surprisingly the guy did only 2 other films) First thing on looking this up here on IMDb was 'Who the hell is that...???'
However, the movie itself is supported strongly by the fantastic work of the acting, especially Lane because he is able to not only convince the audience about his character, but have his character try and act as well, thus creating multiple levels of personality hard to come to terms with inside of just one person.
The tale is told through the eyes of Claudius, step-grandson to Augustus, who suffered from the crippling effects of a childhood illness and was thus despised and ignored by much of his own family.
This is one of the great late appearances of Fuller and thus must be considered valuable for film history.
Thus while not entirely streamlined or satisfying, RTLS is a film with several points of interest and IMO one that deserves a better appreciation than it has thus far received.
It appears he has the advantage of knowing the patterns people make and can thus draw conclusions as to what they're going to do, but at the same time not to give the appearance of knowing this.
Five Senses is an award winning film in Canada, but to others it may be just an example of government effort to encourage creative film making [and thus indirectly censor and control content].
All these elements of '30s American culture receive positive comment in the film, and thus make it more directly American than anything comparable by Disney.
Acting tour-de-forces are manifest everywhere, and although virtually the entire supporting cast brings a Broadway-style truth and urgency that make thus excellent.
Happy Gilmore thus follows Sandler on the golf-court, where 90% of the film takes place.
My favorite bit of unreality involves the caretaker - when they arrive at the place, the caretaker gives Nami the keys, but the scene is played out as a video game sequence, with the caretaker icon's lines being printed on the screen, rather than spoken - thus making it impossible to determine anything, even gender, about this "person".
Flatland is one of my favorite books, thus I was looking forward to this film.
Freakazoid also pokes fun at the other superheroes; thus he is the antithesis of the traditional superhero- if you have watched the show you can tell that he sure doesn't act like one.
Originally a teenage computer nerd, he becomes Freakazoid overnight after he is zapped by the computer screen, whilst on his PC and thus he becomes a totally different character, wearing a black mask and what looks like either red leather spandex or tight skinned pyjamas.
The Open Source movement is a work in progress threatened by the real risk of those benefiting from openness legally protecting their own "added value" and thus, in a sense, betraying their benefactors.
Se7en is uniquely on its own for suspense dramas as it both fuels the need of the audience to be drawn in and entertained by the events unfolding, and remain uncompromising and shocking, thus satisfying the initial vision of the director, David Fincher.
Se7en even dramatically turns the tide at one point, just as the audience is finally getting comfortable and asserted into the gloomy atmosphere, thus creating as much as fear and uncertainty in the audience as it is with the characters involved.
Kurosawa uses the actors that he uses in so many classic movies - Toshiro Mifune (a breakout role for Mifune, who had been typecast as a yakuza in his movie roles thus far), Takashi Shumura (Detective Sato) and the first movie appearance for Minoru Chiaki.
Kurosawa gets each character has its own life, the delight in their weaknesses and their abundance, their strengths and weaknesses, as Terque and his wisdom ... thus creating a human picture that might produce this flash to be erased suddenly, but may never get that and more we are the same.
It runs thus: Hardcase walks along blithely, gun in hand; single bad guy jumps out from behind a building and shoots twice; misses; Hardcase shoots once; kills bad guy; repeat about 15 times as Hardcase draws closer to whatever the hell it is he's looking for.
He is worried about the safety of Aryoung and thus gives her the choice to stay in another country until things settle down in Hong Kong.
Animation can simplify matters in the mise-en-scene to amplify the essential and thus creating more emotion out of this film.
(Spoiler warning)  One of my favorite scenes is the sequence when Seito gets caught for stealing and is taken to the police, thus forced to abandon his little sister.
Nearly every episode I've seen thus far has had some little lesson I could apply in my own life to make myself a better person.
Every elimination thus far has not been one of popularity, appearance or even of ability.
By concentrating on the fascination that all the characters in the movie had with these paintings, the movie thus, for me, extended itself beyond the requirements of who stole the goods and how they did it (the theme, after all, of many tedious heist movies) and became an extended meditation on what it means to possess and be possessed by an image.
SVEN NYKVIST's cinematography is superlative in every sense of the term and it succeeds in making alive even the most inanimate of objects, thus showing us that there may be life in all things.
Davandeh (The runner) is a cinematic ode to the spirit of Amiro, a young orphan boy who seeks to excel in what ever he does, to know more and look beyond his present boundaries, and to seek this knowledge through formal education that has eluded him thus far in life.
The movie is paced brilliantly, and thus creates moments of genuine tension.
It makes absolutely no sense, but that is what is so striking about this scene as well as many in that, the girl, who is right in front of their eyes speaking with them, can't be found, thus sending these parents to act on their toes to try and find her.
BuÃ±uel's camera work makes us feel that we are ghosts gliding through each moment of a very realistic dream thus achieving the surrealist's main goal of presenting a symbolic and rational dreamlike universe, making this movie a must see and one of BuÃ±uel's finest works.
Bunuel's movie was released in 1974, thus just at the time when Pier Paolo Pasolini started to film his last work "Salo", in which (amongst many other marvelous events) there is the famous or infamous scene where people are forced to eat faeces.
Rex Beach's novel has been adapted five times thus far, and it's not hard to see why because the story is as solid as it gets.
Their love is thus immortalized.
I bought the soundtrack as I litsened to it on the radio it I thought the soundtrack was good and thus went out to see the movie, but i deeply regret that move.
There are a lot of laughs together with a subtext about colour not mattering, while at the same time trading on those differences, thus enabling the film to have its cake and eat it.
Ultimately, what makes this story thematically xenophobic is that the Bolivian protagonist is murdered with no accountability, thus the filmmaker's message is... that's it's okay to be a racist.
I simply did not give a hoot about anyone in this movie and, thus, could not have cared less about anything that was happening.
The Piano Teacher shines as her best work thus far.
Victoria as portrayed, is an engaging and thoroughly likable person, very much a child coming into adulthood, and thus a fascinating comparison to the standard historical perspective that we have grown up with.
The timing of When this What later Happened thus presented comparatively little incentive for my interest..
On second thought, let's just make the professionals as stupid as possible, so that we can insure more episodes and, thus, greater ad revenue.
Maybe he didn't because he was a perfectionist, even though the character portrayed is not a native French speaker   There are just two further points I should like to make that nobody else has touched on thus far:  First, the story for the script is from the pen of Danish raconteuse Karen Blixen, magnificently portrayed by Meryl Streep in "Out of Africa", who, Sheherezade-like, beguiled her lover and his friend with her fluent and fascinating tales.
The rarefied atmosphere of the film is thus entirely appropriate.
Spoiler ahead: The film's conclusion is really the fitting endpoint of the tragedy that has been going on since the film's beginning: Bob becomes his own victim... Like a goldfish that refuses to be fed from outside the bowl, he has barricaded himself into his own world, and thus cannot survive.
This troubled woman is a neglected, possibly abused, wife who could possibly be a stranger in a foreign land thus furthering her alienation.
Lynch likes to make the point again and again that our sense of narrative is socially constructed, and he thus takes great delight in subverting our expectations by breaking the narrative line repeatedly.
Hopefully to be considered thus in due time.
This movie is a commendable attempt at telling the story of a simple, yet brave man and thus well-deservedly (50 years later!)
There are many sequences lacking proper editing (shots that are way too long and thus very tiresome), there are other sequences which do not seem to make too much sense at all (e.g.
It reminds me thus of the greatest of character portrayals, Raging Bull--though I'm sure the parallel isn't obvious.
I remember watching this at the drive in movie, it was second on the bill and it was the first really "adult" movie I had ever seen, thus it stayed with me.
However, it is still a nasty bit of femme fatale noir and thus enjoyable on it's own.
The Jews and the Palestinians thus form an alliance, defeat Walbridge and his bigot army, and unite to build a mall of their own.
The Mechanik's plot is thus: Nick Cherenko (Lundgren) is an ex-spetznaz, parachutist, who served in Afghanistan.
This had to be the best of any Inuyasha movie released in English thus far.
And despite the invasion might have made a go of it had the extremists in the Bush Administration not tried to play Mad Scientist and experiment on them with their Social Ideologies, that failed utterly, creating the expected reaction of an outraged populace, thus opening a place for the Islamists to come in.
Although it sometimes relies on the fact that the viewer hasn't read the novels and thus doesn't understand the real characters, I loved this story.
What can I say, I just watched it once as it first aired decades ago, but still had positive memories and thus watched it again a few days ago.
The pacing though was student film like, the information presented ambiguous and thus a great topic executed so inadequately that it became unbearable.
The general rule should thus be: with some very rare exceptions, women over 45 should NOT appear nude on film.
To appreciate it you have to remember two things - firstly, it was made in 1942, and thus there are quite a few patriotic themes in the movie, since that was the kind of film being made at the beginning of World War II, when the U.S. didn't yet know if it would be successful fighting a two front war in which everything was at stake.
Jack Benny insisted that Kilbride made the play and was thus essential for the movie.
While the plot is thoroughly predictable (and, yet, therein lies part of its appeal), it's made with the customary professionalism one associates with the golden age of Hollywood; thus, we're treated to a handsomely-shot large-scale entertainment Â complemented by a fine Franz Waxman score which goes from lush to emphatic or rousing, depending on the mood of any given scene.
The scene in the snow is thus not only the victory of joy and will to live over war (because we aren't allowed to forget these guys are in a war area), but also the liberation one feels when one is finally allowed to express feelings forbidden by society.
The movie is filmed in this army outpost in the mountains bordering Lebanon, in the middle of Winter (thus the snow, that one seldom relates to the Middle East).
thus I venture to guess that Anna Biller may have very well created the first "post-feminist 70's era B flick exploitation homage film" - anyone know of anything else out there like this?
She was not at all her adorable old self, but quiet, reserved, and having a slightly darker, more dullish-brown coat, thus erasing all of her original appeal.
There has thus far been some kind of rule in Disney sequels that characters constantly have to be rolling their eyes, lifting one eyebrow drastically, or saying "Eeeeyew !"
I had read reviews, love Thailand - even to the extent of learning Thai - and was thus very very disappointed.
The written dialogue translated from the Thai and thus quirky had some effect... the tiger would eat the man's flesh and blood and 'memories'... nice notion.
And thus the portrayal of the soldier's desire is conflicting.
One of the worst movies ever made...thus making it one of the best movies ever made.
Legendary Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa is on hand as a Chinese detective working for Scotland Yard, thus providing a positive Asian role model to balance the villainy of the others, but even in his case it's made clear in an early scene that he's a "special worker" who will never be made an official member of the force.
It did not have the feel of the other films (aside for the chronic overacting)and thus left me feeling as though I was watching any old "camp in woods, people dying flick".
The movie was slow-moving for the most part, had poor audio and equally poor visuals: dark and grainy; the casting was pretty bad, and thus, the story -which is purported to be 'true'- seems unbelievable.
I, having not read the books, did not see the movie with such a bias, and thus was not influenced by their contents.
The son is supposedly to inherit his legacy, and thus living the Arabian way of life for the rest of his days.
The villain receives a pardon for all crimes committed in the county, the problem is the murders he was convicted of took place outside the sheriff's jurisdiction and thus outside the county.
The edits thus become extremely long, the emotions excessive and repetitive, and the plot simply becomes either irritating or unbelievable.
Some people forgot- and thus "Gigli" was born.
It required brain work at all the time, thus major involvement.
Only Blair Witch Project (1999) thus far, pulled off a feat to beat under similar circumstances.
The terrorist caller has a number of minor Tagalog grammar lapses, not to mention his accent not distinctly native, thus a bit unpersuasive to those who really speak the language.
Though already seen in various horror films, its edgy camera-work with no known focus is fitting, thus notable, enhancing the distress suggested by the situation.
Above all, the message is channeled tactfully, thus swaying, going far beyond the bounds of being preachy.
If you notice in most of the positive reviews here, the author will often say something like, "Of all of Prince's movies..." Look, if you have seen more than 2 of Prince's movies, you are a Prince groupie and thus can not be counted on to give an unbiased review.
The problem with some French productions in 2002 is that they want to copy US blockbusters but unfortunately the worst ones...  To summarise don't waste your money on thus turkey.
And thus I must announce to the world that this film breaks the most important law in Italian horror cinema: You can make it corny and cheap and incoherent - but it has to be fun!
Then we have the dude they're both after, who does nothing except getting captured, thus being in need of rescuing by the two girls.
Neither Joyce Chopra nor her screen writing team have made any attempt to emotionally involve their audience, and any attention to the details of this tragic case is completely non-existent, thus leaving the viewers frustrated and starved of information.
This one is played straight and thus only has interest for cinema or Western historians.
There's one sequence near the beginning that I found particularly smart, showing how the assignment for murder is passed on to several involved parties and thus creating a complex structure that sadly never gets properly clarified.
Full Metal Yakuza is far from his greatest achievements and ambitions and thus is not at all among his most noteworthy films, but that is understandable considered the film's speedy low budget exploitation money maker status.
no doubt from people all connected to this movie and thus meaningless to me.
The game has a very simple structure; go around and receive "tasks/quests" from various persons (controlled by other players) and solve these tasks/quests by killing animals and monsters, thus getting rewarded by "items".
The zombies, not truly being undead but just drugged out homicidal maniacs, are the result of being sprayed by a secret government herbicide, and thus die all too easily (as any normal person would).
It would have been better to leave 'Blackbeard's Ghost' in limbo, thus sparing the rest of us from this shipwreck of a movie.
As for the other actors, Natasha McElhone is better than she was in FearDot.Com, and this is NOT like saying Pauley Shore was better in SON-IN-LAW than he was in BIO-DOME; she's not only beautiful, but gives a decent performance; however, what she lacks is star power, the charisma that a star like Julia Roberts can bring to a picture, thus making Kelvin's yearning and his ultimate decision more real.
I guess this is Soderbergh's way of reclaiming his "art house" roots, but frankly, it's ridiculous, as is some of the dialogue, which is just plain bad, not even bad enough to border on camp (and thus give the audience some pleasure).
The script by Ellis Walker is a total mess from start to finish, there are flashbacks, flash-forwards, dreams, dreams within dreams, hallucinations, a confusing plot that doesn't work, a terrible ending that makes no sense & the whole film is just a narrative nightmare as you are thrust from one scenario to another in the blink of an eye & thus not really giving you the chance to take the already confused plot in since it chops & changes so much.
I have a DVD binder called "Inside The Earth," which contains about a dozen films with the same basic plot: scientists must use "futuristic" drilling machine thingy to drive into the center of the Earth to save the planet by either a) realigning tectonic plates b) setting off nuclear bombs c) allowing volcanoes to explode, thus relieving pressure, etc.
A really weak plot about a carnivorous alien plant made all the worse by putting it into musical form, thus treating us to Rick Moranis' singing "ability".
She is thus spoiled by her poor husband, trying to be nice and give her what she wants while knowing that things he gives into will be bad in the end.
The premise is that the people who don't co-operate with the communal needs of the state, are "scum of the earth" or "crop fertilizer" and they are portrayed as being selfish and undesirable murderers in the film and thus have to be 'weeded out'.
Profits from these sales went to the Contras in Nicaragua, thus the Iran-Contra scandal begins.
He doesn't keep up with the times, thus he loses his edge.
First, when the stupid lady falls in the lake (thus allowing the audience a cheap thrill when she flashes her boobs), the bad cousin pushes the stupid girl's clothes into the fire (where the had been drying).
Was his Scrooge trying to suppress himself from being emotional, thus folding his arms?
There's a big CGI computer effects explosion at the end but if it really was a nuclear bomb there would have been an electro magnetic pulse which would have shut down all electrical equipment including the helicopter Seagal was flying & thus send him crashing into the Ocean but Black Dawn isn't that concerned with factual accuracy.
Unfortunately, the producers ram this point home with inane, superfluous shots of life designed to illustrate a phrase that a reader read in new age monotone, thus failing to even attempt to capture much of the mystery that the man is shrouded within and focus more on vague, abstract clips.
I hope that folks realize that there is a judgment day, and that the spreading of false information about God and the Son may not go well with those who are thus judged.
Made more "relevant" for the mid-90s -- by introducing the idea that the aliens were trying to get us to degrade our planet and thus make it habitable for them -- the ecological subtext seems a little knee-jerk ten years later.
They had been here for untold years before David Vincent's fateful encounter with them one dark night on a lonely road at a deserted diner, thus they had infiltrated positions in society from a prostitute in a bar to positions of power within the Department of Defense.
), and yet another relative (brother to Jupiter from the first film and, thus, Pluto's uncle), dubbed "The Reaper", and who appears out of nowhere.
When the two become romantically involved, a complicated situation forms since Lillian is being wooed by Meno Argenti (Omar Sharif), a powerful plutocrat who controls the emerald trade for the rotten Mexican government, thus leading to shared distaste between the two men.
Bettany put in a career worse as the bad guy and his decisions to scare Harrison Ford by eliminating a few of his own gang members, thus putting Ford's character in a stronger position, almost had me laughing.
The storyline is amazing, thus the characters are chosen so well, and the actors are the best Yugoslavian actors there are today in the acting business.The whole storyline is carefully planned, although it might seems a bit confusing at first, you get used to it, and after that it's just a Joy ride from than on.
Poor Harrison Ford, looking like he hasn't slept in days (and this is BEFORE his family is kidnapped), seems to sense that he is indeed at the nadir of his career and thus turns in a performance that is so lacking in energy and interest that he seems more bored with the material than we are.
What could've been a fascinating film is thus turned into unintentionally humorous dreck.
While I don't watch movies or shows that are appalling to me (thus explaining why I watched "Locusts" rather than "Desperate Housewives"), I am entertained by pictures that I find ridiculous.
I had trouble understanding the play that was happening throughout the film, thus causing me to care less about the characters.
The only question I have about the movie thus far is if I can even stand to watch it til it's inevitably horrid conclusion.
Might as well go ahead and subtract another 2 points for the terrible acting displayed thus far.
he was an "American" psycho...a fraud...a tacky, tacky fraud, as most people were in the 80's...as being the purpose of this book...to comment on the American condition during that time(and in my opinion it is still mostly apt) thus negating the premise of this entire movie...unless your an idiot and completely missed the point of either the book or the movie...then the movie will still suck!!!!!!!!!!!!
From that point forward, she decides to do whatever it takes to kill/capture all the serial killers of the world Â thus becoming one in the process.
Her goal for the film, become William Shatner's teaching assistant so that she can get into Quantico and thus fulfilling her dreams to capture serial killers.
I was rather surprised at the 6.8 rating this movie has received thus far, and I hope that more positive reviews will come in order for the score to be bumped up to at least the mid 7's.
And thus the jokes and the story(spoof) are given a chance at humor.
This is cemented when the campfire Jason story is interrupted thus a newcomer still wouldn't know anything about the origins of Jason.
He himself gets unceremoniously vacuumed up, and thus there goes the villain, sigh, whoopee.
Their interest is, however, scientific, except for the legionnaire buddy who is more interested in gold statuettes accidentally getting lost in his greatcoat pockets (Having mentioned the legionnaire, I must say that I admire the courage of the scriptwriter, who reveals to us -for the very first time- that Egypt was at the time a French protectorate, and not, as we've been led to believe by the official history, associated to the British empire)  The bad guys stick to the old, slow, boring system of studying the terrain and excavating carefully according to old Ieroglyphs, while our hero and his friends discover the tomb the legendary grave by happily throwing dynamite sticks at random: a new path is opened thus for archeology.
Two undercover "T-men" (United States Treasury Agents) attempt to uncover a counterfeiting ring as a narrator describes the technical details of the laborious process they use to do it... at great detail, in other words, repetitively, like thus: "He trailed him, shadowing, hiding, keeping hidden, shadowing, trailing..." and so on.
- Blue collar workers are portrayed as lazy under-skilled workers who spend all their money on lottery and luxury items, and thus cannot even afford their children's medical fees.
Their purpose is to excite interest in the upcoming film, thus "possessing" you to spend $10 to go see it.
Who cares what happened to any of the characters; perhaps it would have been better if they all expired within the first 5 minutes and thus spared the viewer for lame dialog and a tremendously boring story.
Both films were targeted at family friendly audiences, thus inhibiting themselves from actually trying to scare anyone.
I've loved all the Hellraiser movies, thus far, except III, which I've yet to see, but even this one wrenches my gut.
People's minds tend to get clouded by the fact that Dragonball Z was so influential or might have been one of the first anime they ever watched(and thus introduced them to anime in general) that they remember only the good points and overlook the numerous jarring flaws of the series.
A genuinely first rate supporting cast has been assembled around her from the always charming Clark Gregg as her long suffering ex husband, Richard Campbell, to Hamish Linklater as her refreshingly laid-back brother/nanny Matthew and even the fresh faced Trevor Gagnon as her (thus far dramatically unchallenged) son Ritchie Campbell (destined for a lifetime of therapy with this horror of a "mother").
One such character, Leatherface, stands out for the fact that he was born without a face, thus using human skin to gain an identity.
The biggest waste of six minutes I've ever spent in my life thus far.
The plan works, because the idiotic secretary decides to conveniently buy out all the mangos, thus preventing them from ever proving the tape to be the fraud that it is.
Dr. Magrew show's Robert various living puppets made by puppeteer Andre Toulon that he brought in an auction some years previous & ask's Robert to carve the perfect puppet which Magrew hopes to inject with life & recreate Toulon's success...  Curse of the Puppet Master was the fifth sequel to the rather splendid killer puppet flick Puppetmaster (1989) & apparently had the working title Puppet Master 6: The Curse but by this stage it was probably a wise decision to stop numbering them & thus try to fool a few unsuspecting buyers.
There's no continuity to the earlier films at all, there's no mention of the green life giving serum & Curse of the Puppet Master changes the whole central concept to animating the puppets with a human beings soul which is transferred into the puppet thus giving it life instead of the serum from the previous films.
Sure, he got something out of their affair too - but it was primarily the knowledge that he helped *her*, thus giving him the confidence to become a priest and help other people.
This is offensive, not because of the politics, but because of the dishonesty; it's easy to paint everyone opposed to you as a brutal, vicious Fascist, and thus (in theory, anyway) renders any possible argument against the film moot.
Also, it must be noted that it is a B-movie, and thus will never be good.
The audience never becomes accustomed to any of the characters--thus we could not care less about what happens to them.
Of the 122 films I have rated thus far, Nine Months is the first film I have awarded a 1 to.
I couldn't bring myself to care about Affleck's character, and thus didn't get emotionally involved with this movie.
(6) Finally - I mean, there are more, but I'll stop with this one - the folks of rural Wisconsin aren't portrayed in a very positive light - thus the closing "dedicated to the great state of Wisconsin" seems a bit ironic.
His ancestor-worship calls attention to this, and thus the movie can be taken as religious criticism.
I have a feeling that strict horror fans are the ones writing positive reviews of the Masters of Horror episodes, as they have been mostly abysmal thus far.
Conveniently, about this time, Mark's car breaks down and thus the humor ensues.
One might assume that the vast amount of money it actually costs to produce television and movies here - thus, the obvious reason for the frequency of purchased, far cheaper, foreign programs - could result in television with at least a minimum degree of equality to those purchased from abroad.
To my opinion, the whole production of the movie is bad as the storyline loses thread and a viewer is thus left confused and rather disturb.
Dr. Magrew show's Robert various living puppets made by puppeteer Andre Toulon that he brought in an auction some years previous & ask's Robert to carve the perfect puppet which Magrew hopes to inject with life & recreate Toulon's success...  Curse of the Puppet Master was the fifth sequel to the rather splendid killer puppet flick Puppetmaster (1989) & apparently had the working title Puppet Master 6: The Curse but by this stage it was probably a wise decision to stop numbering them & thus try to fool a few unsuspecting buyers.
There's no continuity to the earlier films at all, there's no mention of the green life giving serum & Curse of the Puppet Master changes the whole central concept to animating the puppets with a human beings soul which is transferred into the puppet thus giving it life instead of the serum from the previous films.
While I don't watch movies or shows that are appalling to me (thus explaining why I watched "Locusts" rather than "Desperate Housewives"), I am entertained by pictures that I find ridiculous.
It was supposedly a "true" story; thus a real tragedy.
This globally acclaimed and masterful film was definitely one of the most risky and dared projects in cinema history and thus it also easily could have been one of the biggest failures ever.
None of the sequels really offered anything that the original didn't and thus they became rather boring movies.
With Englund's first time behind the camera, you would expect something truly unique or at least something close to being even remotely frightening like "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984), but when things get interesting "976-EVIL" devolves into typical slasher/possession stuff and thus joins the ranks of so many other "B" horror movies from the 1980s.
To fully appreciate how awful an idea this is you need only imagine a Star Wars sequel in which the action is suddenly set in present day Earth for reasons of plot convenience or a second instalment of Titanic in which it's revealed that Jack and Rose are actually time-travellers and are thus able to prevent the disaster and save all their friends.
It contradicts the entire HIGHLANDER mythos, and thus was ignored in every other sequel and television series that followed.
Pollock's character, Eli, is a rote "Ladies' Man" while Julie Brown plays 'Zoe' thus accentuating her quirkiness.
You just need to find one whose opinions and tastes are similar to your own and thus s/he will provide you with valuable guidance.
Problem with this film is my review thus far is just as frightening as the entire movie.
Sad things as I kind of expected more of it but to me it looks like it got hammered by someone not getting the initial concept and just wanting a nice action romp ignoring the complex(and thus nonsensical if not explained properly) subtext going on all around.
Hall, about cat food manufacturers over acting outrageously and using human cadavers as the secret ingredient in the most popular cat food in town, and thus creating a horde of (or at least one or two) bloodthirsty kitties.
"Snapshot" is one of them; a peculiar psycho-thriller/melodrama hybrid that coincidentally came out shortly after the huge box office success of "Halloween" and thus had to be re-titled "The Day After Halloween" in order to make extra money and cash in on the success of John Carpenter's classic.
The plot is weak, isn't explained very well and is thus confusing, but never mind because here comes another set piece that has absolutely nothing to do with advancing the plot.
In a telling scene in Goldeneye, Judy Dench (M) accuses Brosnan (Bond) thus: "You're a sexist, misogynist dinosaur - a relic of the cold war."
In a word, if you are watching this film, you most likely are into low budget camp films, and thus can appreciate this film for what it is.
Overall I felt hurt I had wasted my time watching this film, the very least they could have done was edit it so it all stories were linked and thus gave somewhat correlated chronology of events, instead of mind wobbling mess of themes.
To do a re-make (and do it thus badly) is simply inexcusable.
It was also the 25 million dollars wired into the mole's secret numbered Swiss Bank Account that had a big hand in him, or her, keeping the lid on the nuclear device and thus keep it from from blowing up a city of over two million people!
In an opening scene the camera tracks a female dancer running through a theatre backstage, pleading for a band aid she will never get--thus slyly presaging the untreatable tragedies that will eventually unfold.
They take the best clips from the series that most people have already seen and place them one after another out of context, thus stripping them of any of the original comedic value or suspense.
Tumors in the frontal lobe can cause changes in personality, thus the question whether her decision to kill child-molesters and other criminals is a matter of choice or of psychiatric nature hangs unanswered.
There are many missed opportunities where something exciting could have happened, or something could have been revealed to add depth to the main characters (and thus increase the chances of the viewer developing some hint of empathy with them.)
(now i remember the lifestream in the game, but it did not have resurrecting properties, if it did, they could have brought aeris back to life, thus making a completely different story) so cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into the pool and we have a ultra cheezy hallmark/ lifetime type moment.
Plus the film's in black and white, thus there's no chance of seeing anything green.
The story itself seems to get lost in the probably overstretched biographical original tale of woe, and thus meanders about as if in a misty labyrinth in the Great Rift Valley.
Many images remain disconnected and thus remain hollow.
I'm trying real hard to enjoy these Paul Naschy films, but thus far I'm not impressed.
), sees a former scientist friend jump to his suicide, and has on a disc all of the juicy details, thus leading to whistle blowing, and being fired from his job.
(Which thus also endangered the mission) Since when do we let computers make judgment calls?
this is thus far a squandered opportunity.
It shows you you're not alone, thus making YOUR SHAME GO AWAY.
The writer hinted at some of these, but she never delved into it thus making it a predictable story that could have ended thirty minutes into the film.
It is thus important that this review exists to inform readers of the futility inherent in watching wuxia films released during that period of time.
I'm trying real hard to enjoy these Paul Naschy films, but thus far I'm not impressed.
Yet here's the most unbelievable bit - read this and weep: given the opportunity to cast Richard E. Grant as potentially the most electrifying Sherlock Holmes in decades, our bumbling Watson of a casting director elects to cast him in the role of the villain, thus relegating the characterisation of Holmes to the usual mediocrity we have sadly come to expect.
To add insult to injury, the choice in cinematography gives the show a camcorder look at times, thus cheapening the overall experience.
Unfortunately, they're given little to work with in dialog, dramatic situations and direction, and thus appear to trudge through their work laboriously.
It is thus not surprising that Jericho shares the same flaws.
The final sequences of both films jar with what precedes - thus undermining the audiences suspension of disbelief, and in the case of the first film, ruining a perfectly decent set-up.
For those who wanted an action movie, I'm told De Palma dumbed down the other MI movies, thus moving it further yet from the spirit of the original series.
Somehow I thought the letter kid had forgotten to add the T after BUS thus making it a rude duo.
The story talks the investigation by Symbologist Langdom when happen the killing of Museum Louvre's curator named Jacques Sauniere(Jean Pierre Melville).The corpse is around with codes,cipher and symbols.Nearly from him they have found a baffling pentagram and a Fibonacci numbers.Solving the enigmatic questions,Robert along with the cryptologist Sophie are stunned to discover clues leading a trail of enigmas hidden,thus with the Leonardo's paintings : Gioconda and Madonna on the rocks find a riddling key with a flower the Lis .It leads them to a Bank where its director named Andre Vernet(Jurgen Prochnow) deliver the security safe containing a keystone.But a French police inspector named Fache(Jean Reno)chases Langdom and Sophie.Meanwhile a murderer psychopath and masochist monk wearing a cilice for inflicting pain so he can suffer as Christ suffered, is pursuing them.Besides an Opus Dei bishop named Aringarosa(Alfred Molina) is scheming odds plans.
The moniker was given to the painting by the Art biographer Vasari in the 1800's; thus, Leonardo never could have come up with the outlandish anagrams.
During the intro we have John Carradine (him again Â the more bad B-movies I discover, the more I encounter his fatigue face) murmuring something about being the devil and thus He who decides whether a person goes to hell or not.
Even at a mere 46 minutes, the film is mostly a drag Â since the comedy is generally forced, thus unfunny, and the quality of the animation extremely poor when compared to the dazzling imagination displayed by the form in its heyday.
Thus far, thus John Wyndham (there are strong parallels here with the novel "The Day of the Triffids").
- Olga Kurylenko is from the Ukraine, and this was her first film, thus making it difficult to obtain financing.
It was shot in a very matter-of-fact way and thus the movie's gayness started to subside.
The whole concept just didn't work as far as I'm concerned & the film spent a good 30 minutes explaining it's own set of Vampire 'rules' as Grant would ask a question like how to kill a Vampire & Gray would tell him thus making sure we, the viewer that is, know as well.
However, one of the FBI agents friends leaks the info to the mafia family, thus the family is killed but they missed the boy.
Kasdan was coming off a bumper crop of hits as screenwriter and director, and thus had the ability to do whatever he wanted and work with whoever he wanted in 1985.
Songs are continually cut off midway, and even as early as now it seems Zimmy had begun altering the arrangement of some of them, thus making them too unlike their album counterparts to really get into.
Spoiler follows: The ideas of planet ruin via garbage and humans becoming fat, technologically catered to, isolated in space, and thus unmotivated beings after 700 years is interesting but each of these is not original and I, at this time, cannot clearly describe why the film failed to engage me.
She allows her girls to have free reign and control, and thus the story becomes disastrous.
It is thus very hard to sympathise with her, or any other of the rather uninspiring characters.
His work thus directly brought World War II to an early end and saving hundreds of thousands of lives in the process.
Its the only one that ever scared me during and especially after,for...OK weeks.The eye effects have been used in things since but at the time they did freak me out.The child abuse stuff is damaging.The satanic ritual stuff,even though its been the reason it seems that oh so Christian Americans like to believe that true evil in their country exists for the last few centuries and is thus THE stereotypical scapegoat,and even though it's as unbelievable as any other religion,well it is scary anyway.After all it's TV so a level of disbelief must be maintained.I think a major reason it scared me was the concepts,if they were true just feel more fear inducing than an individual who kills with electricity (DPO) or inbreds(Home) or any of the many reincarnation ones.
Admittedly, the print I saw was in bad shape and thus difficult to follow, especially towards the end, but I suspect that even if a pristine camera negative of LAUGHING GAS turned up in a vault somewhere it wouldn't make much difference, quality-wise.
This is a Harry Potter film, and thus should Harry Potter be more present on the scene.
Ferrell, McBride, and Matt Lauer are the only things that keep it from being horribly unwatchable but not from being one of the very worst of the summer and the year thus far.
Zamm also tries to create a Dr. Claw that is closer to the original Â but the trouble occurs with the fact that the two share very little screen time and thus there is no real chemistry between the two.
I Liked "Death Note I/II" too much, both at conceptual level as well as executional level thus as soon as I saw the poster, I grabbed the movie.
However, this movie was a disappointment to me as it laked all the good things of Death Notes movies such as tight paced plot, adequate and intriguing twists n turns, the mental battle between Kira and L and the Reaper....   For the starters, movie plot involves the last 23 days of legendary L as he tries to battle out a group of environmentalists whose plan is to make world a better place for living by spreading a deadly Virus (mixture of Ebola and Influenza virus) and thus reducing the size of ecological footprint of mankind by reducing the number of living people rather than researching new energy efficient technologies etc.
The stories, and thus also the suspense, are too often abruptly cut off to return to the present day main characters and their continuous uninteresting bickering.
"99 Women", at least the original non-hardcore version, got released during the earliest stage of "W.I.P" madness and thus Franco was still clearly 'exploring' how far he could go with inserting lesbian sleaze and brutal whippings.
The TV guide described the plot of SEVERED TIES as thus : " An experiment on a severed arm goes awry " so right away I thought this was going to be about an arm that`s got a mind of its own as seen in THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS or THE HAND or someone getting an arm transplant as in BODY PARTS .
In one scene, Samara forces a psychiatrist to inject herself with air and thus kill herself; by that point, I was jealous of the psychiatrist.
You realise the intention - thus you are displeased.
My similar great disappointment of this first movie is thus inevitably coloring my comment posted here.
having the point of view switch when the cops see the video was not only jolting but bad movie making, because there was no reason beyond confusing the audience with facts that can't possibly fit the film thus far.
Of the three Brett Kelly films I've seen thus far(the Bonesetter Returns, Final Curtain & The Feral Man), I feel it's safe to say that I enjoyed this one the most by far.
However, it all feels very random and the plot running through all these ideas fails to be interesting at every turn, thus making the film very boring indeed.
Despite the fact that this film was banned in the UK back in the eighties, it's not very gory; thus making it one of the disappointing entries on the list that didn't really deserve to be banned.
Farhan Akhtar has created the characters of the three main protagonists with a lot attention to detail and thus, has created characters that the youth in India can relate to.
The ending is totally ridiculous, and thus very fitting to the rest of the film.
She has already been set up as extremely unsympathetic from the first few scenes, leading up to the one with her own daughter and son, thus the scene with a replacement "daughter" just doesn't wash at all.
The plot - what there is of it - has Uncle Cedric who is pulled in by a golddigger,Joan Blondell and is taken away from the focus of his business, by the golddigger who uses sex -it's implied - to make her a daughter and thus an inheritor.
But it still retains the same passion and romanticism that has become a Bollywood staple ever since the beginning, thus making DCH a thousand times better than other "Hollywood-wannabees".
Akash is not able to understand the depth of Sid's love and hurts his sentiments for which Sid slaps Akash, thus creating a rfit between the two friends.
The second half is filled with emotion though the Aamir-Preity affair has been stretched a lot thus making the film a bit lengthy.
The timing should be quite different however the canned laughter track is timed for a sitcom not for a comedy show and thus makes all of the comedy fall totally flat.
Who knows why, but Lucas must have decided that people who go to movies only go to movies because they wish to escape a world full of text images, and thus most of the different alien races in Episode 1 speak english, limiting the use of subtitles.
Near the end of the film, the cook accidentally sets her apartment on fire and then falls in love with the firemen who saves her, the gay man accidentally mixes up letters to his lover and mother, thus he has to fly back to the Philippines to retrieve the letter containing sexy pics of him and his lover and before his mother finds out - WHEW!!!
What the screen writer forgot was that Gooding had been a good defense attorney and thus would have known that his hands had no gun powder residue on them but that the killer had gun powder residue from the automatic on his hands.
thus tempting us to watch to see if someone actually might.
It's the rental video equivalent of the "Ancient Evils" Lovecraft wrote about: it's horrible beyond your imagination, and thus beyond your ability to conceptualize.
Years of hearing people describe "Seven Mummies" or "House of the Dead" as THE WORST eventually changed my mind... these are notably bad movies, but are enjoyable enough despite/because of this, and thus cannot possibly be THE WORST.
It must have worked because the disaster thus far has been averted.
Lise, thus far not experienced in the ways of the flesh, has a crush on Gwen that is not returned, and then punishes Gwen for spurning her interest by sabotaging Gwen's "romances".
He was obviously engaged to Andromeda at the beginning, thus setting up 2 different love triangles.
This film is about as entertaining as a root canal without anesthesia, and thus is tantamount to torture.
This second part has been obliterated in the film, and so has the novel's dialogue, its portraiture of characters and most of the plot, thus entirely robbing the story of its meaning.
So we don't know a thing about these two and thus could care less about them, what they are doing or what happens to them (in this case, getting killed off by the dead woman's monstrous son).
I know it was just his/her opinion, but hell - BAD IS BAD - Anyone giving a thumbs up to some of those bombs is obviously just trying to get free screener copies and thus is a worthless, biased 'critic'...
The brains behind these illegal atrocities naturally are well protected and thus every action taken by our heroic cops turns out pointless.
One incident in particular is the scene in which "boomer" valiantly smashes through an assembly of stained glass windows on her motorcycle and carefully times her departure from the vehicle in the form of a triple back-flip, projecting the motorcycle at high speeds towards the apparently "bullet-fast" creature within the building's confines, only for the motorcycle to attain a vertical position along the creatures' abdomen, turning perfectly, exposing the "ever-so-small" gas tank, allowing "boomer" an effortless, but nonetheless accurate shot at the flammable contents of the tank, and thus "efficiently" dispatching this foul creature from existence... With her flawless perfection of shot, and ample bosom, how could anyone despise this movie...for laughs.
In the end: (1) scientists figure out how to use the vent-bacteria to kill the virus, thus saving the world for the moment; (2) the military conspirators kill each other because some of them have a change of heart; (3) the President decides to go ahead with the vent-mining anyway (4) a cigarette-smoking man saves a sample of the virus in the International Space Station so it will be available for the future.
Don Coscarelli's vision, while implemented in a low-budget and thus low-key fashion, has proven to be a major influence on horror films of the '80s and '90s.
Alas, the very next scene after you see Gedrick's plane explode, they cut to a military guy saying "No, the kid's dead and buried..." thus removing all doubt that the entire rest of the picture will be without him.
As it will further educate the male population how worthless their lives are and how hated they are and thus speed up the arrival and strengthen the backlash against the very message of this anime - feminism.
Maybe the film could have been a bit shorter and thus brisker.
The film thus mostly ignores the most relevant people, and chooses instead to tell the story of background people who talk endlessly around a sociology topic that has been talked to death.
The soldiers are thus shown as ultimately superior intellects in warfare, and while they may have been, Te Wheke was taken so easily, almost casually so, after months of successful evasion.
Then I will return this DVD and hopefully this review and all the others will prevent those who haven't seen it from seeing it thus making movie stores get rid of it and this movie may not exist anymore!
When rating a horror film, I always take into consideration any inclusion of unnecessary scenes of quality female nudity (there's always room for some nekkid flesh); thus The Legend of the Mummy saves itself from the shame of receiving the lowest possible score by the (wrinkled) skin of its (decayed) teeth!
Juan Piquer Simon used to be a postman (thus linking him to Fabrizio de Angelis, ex-postman and director of "Killer Crocodile"), but quit his job to step into the movie business.
The sheriff supplied Dr. Myra with drunks and criminals from his jail house and felt that innocent teenagers being used in Dr. Myra's insane ventures are a little too much and refuses to work with her and her hoods thus getting a bullet in his chest from Wrof killing him.
Having it out on the boat the teenagers overpower Dr. Myra and Worf and take them prisoner to the police and US military authorities on shore thus saving the USA from a covert takeover by a hostile power; as for Ivan he completely disappeared right off the radar screen.
First off, they used a 16mm camera that had to have been at least thirty years old, thus making the quality of the picture suck.
A chipmunk attacks, a dolphin attacks, a mockingbird bites the guy's nose like in a Goofy cartoon oh - and a lizard attacks - and after he does - they show him snickering - thus making the snickering lizard more three-dimensional than any of the supporting characters.
She is so amazed at what an ass this guy is, she decides to give him enough rope to hang himself, and winds up, much to her surprise, enjoying his company, and thus, the romance begins.
Amelia Shankley was absolutely wonderful as the dark haired,contemplative Sara Crewe:not only did she look like Sara,but interpreted the part with such conviction, as if she were truly living the character, enduring her adversities with the complexity of a myriad of emotions that swelled in her young heart and pictured clearly on her sore-plagued face.But her eyes lit up immediately when she was approached by Lottie or Ermengarde,or any one she thought a kind soul, partly out of the comfort it gave her, partly because her proud little spirit would refuse to have it otherwise, but mostly because of her consideration towards others' feelings:she knew, because of her own craving for it, what the warmth of a kindly smile could do to kindle and cheer a lonely heart, and thus she afforded them with a conscious good will.
I know this is a movie and thus not a real depiction of any reverend, but still...it was very discerning to watch. )
When worse comes to worse, most scenes are shot in the dark, or near dark ( presumably to fake the just ridiculous & apparent shortage of special effects: the "smog monster" is simply pathetic ), thus making it difficult to follow.
She, most of all, knows that at the time of the killing only her and the valet have been in the house and are thus suspects for the crime.
After 3 or 4 alarms go off, she finally just starts throwing them out the window,thus making a clever point: time flies?
Wizards of the Demon Sword was made during a period rife with extremely bad sword and sorcerer movies, yet it has the dubious distinction of being about the worst I've thus far run across.
There was mythological mystery of the new world, a conspiracy hailing back from Earth 1, quite likable characters, a goal for the characters to reach (and thus a chance for the show (and the characters) to grow).
Too many episodes around some dumb tw*t doing something stupid after being asked not to, thus costing time, food, supplies etc, then rescuing them."
From what I gathered it seems to play a few years after Don Quixote's fight against the windmills and all of his adventures and the movie is to about 50% about Sancho's Donkey (thus called Donkey Xote).
Also, the fact that you know what sort of movie it is and when it was made ensures that it's always obvious what's going to happen, thus meaning that you're sitting there waiting for it.
I can't believe that of the 260 people who have thus far voted on this movie, that 60 have given it a 10.
What was really funny was once she got into the job, and she took her job seriously since this is what an honest person would do, regardless of the job, not to mention she was really good at it, and thus she began to make her workplace more homey.
She then she breaks one of the glass panes with her mobile phone that lands on the floor covered in toxic dust thus breaking the protective seal of the house.
Instead, it is another "for dumb teens only" horror picture that lacks any real scares, is laden with awful clichÃ©s and ultimately fails because it bares the name and thus, seemingly tries to live up to the standards set by the infinitely better "original".
There are movies that are really bad, but are so bad they are actually good, thus watchable.
Naomi Foner's screenplay (from Seth Margolis' novel) has unfortunately underdeveloped its pivotal players, and thus we are unable to associate with them and get under their skin.
The plot is thus fairly straight forward and serves as an excuse for the characters to fall on their butts and fight in an overly theatrical manner, judged by today's standards anyway.
Such is the brilliance of the comedy in Gergory's Girl, that one of the best sequences of comedy is, in fact, one in which a joke is established to exist but never revealed thus acting as a moment of comedy all by itself.
One final important note: Film is not MANGA made, thus it is bad enough (Ninja Scroll was MANGA's)
I assumed when I saw the disc available that it was the sequel to "Ninja Scroll", and thus not happy when I found out it wasn't.
Having thus seduced them into bliss, she exits with her man, while the shrewish liberal harpy who'd exploited her worst of all now finds her own happy ending onstage, crowing out a song which succinctly condemns every facet of humanity without discretion, or any sense at all.
While Leon Ichaso deserves a panning for his take with the film, in truth, the only vaguely interesting things about the real MP was his bad art & why it caught on (briefly & limitedly) & then disappeared- as a man he was a cipher, thus the film's worship of 'art' over humanity, not to mention its ridiculous conflation of import on MP by counterpointing the protagonist against documentary footage of celebrities like Muhammad Ali, Richard Nixon, Ayatollah Khomeini, & John Lennon).
Once again we have a terminally boring and dumb oddity that no one has seen, and those that have feel privileged for some odd reason and thus, obligated to hype it up into something its not even close to being.
This show has no appeal to those of us with a refined sense of humor and I thus spit on it and all who enjoy it, for the simple reason that it only conveys dark humor and insanity of the most vulgar variety.
Once upon a time,back during the second Middle East conflict,the Israelis had a plane in the air 24/7 carrying a nuclear bomb.If they looked like losing(how's that for bad sportsmanship)they would bomb the crap out of Egypt.Sort of like picking up their toys and stomping off home.This plane - or one of a number of planes so equipped - I'm a bit confused on this point - is shot down and lies hidden in the desert for 29 years until it is discovered by Arabs,and a South African(taken over from the Brits in the International Villain stakes) buys it for $400 dollars,selling it on to a unregenerate nazi for $50 million.Said unregenerate nazi (Mr Alan Bates - a chain smoker just to add to his general bastardness) uses it to blow up a football stadium in Baltimore thus plunging the world into the nuclear abyss.Go figure.
Luckily young master Ryan is able to get a few days off school to persuade the Russian Premier and the President of the United States that he knows better than either of them and after some jolly tense moments the President grits "Stand down to Defcon 3",thus earning young Jack a Gold Star.
The President's advisors didn't think terrorists could build a multi-stage weapon, thus the suspicion was immediately upon the Russians.
And that's a big problem because we feel detached from it and, thus, don't feel it is as sharp, timely and intense as Clancy meant it to be.
But when Danny is assigned to a job of investigating a rash of murdered politicians where no triggering device is evident in the debris, Danny soon fears for his wife's safety, and thus his extra incentive to bring the bad guys to justice.
Use it to give us a real insight into the relationship of the characters, thus creating a more interesting level to any involvement later on.
The plot details here differ with most other versions I've seen thus far and particularly Sweeney Todd's motivations to kill the customers that set foot in his barbershop aren't as convincing as usual.
The noose becomes magically suspended from an invisible pole Â which we never see Â thus providing the leverage the accomplice needs to hang the dude.
Then there are some excitingly unnecessary characters like Brinkmann's mother and Arsenjew's wife, who were cut from the first part of the film for US release, but for some inexplicable reason can be seen at the ending, thus making the whole mess even more perplexing.
Even though it looks like a tiny toy tank, it manages to run over the stomach of a 7 foot Russian astronaut, thus giving the petite female surgeon excuse to undress the heroic male and operate on him to save his vitals (sorry, not shown!).
Throughout the movie, it seems as though everyone's being taped (thus, the title) - but to no end, since the tapes really end up playing no role whatsoever.
Killing characters before time, changing names, cutting important scenes, and creating some that don't even come in the book, thus looking artificially inserted.
But since the film is mainly a horror film, the other stuff is just mentioned in passing and thus the imagery seems pretentious.
- the idea of sending an ambassador vs sending their message on all TV channels and thus reaching all people without even landing and causing this panic ... what do you thing is better?
While actors don't bump into the furniture, they don't bump into other characters and thus, the film fails to hit a cohesive tempo.
A film unfortunately is restricted to roughly two hours, and thus at best can only be a short story.
Evident political overtones and manipulation are in process, such that the millions of telephone calls - on "special" numbers which are the most expensive, thus generating wealth for TV companies and the organizers - are just one gigantic fraud.
I guess about the worst one I have seen thus far was when the fathers and Lok used a giant turtle shell to maneuver underwater and (ready for this?)
They have nowhere to go or expand, and thus the ending keeps getting further and further away.
They know you will return for a sequel of a hugely popular movie and thus take the time to overload it with PC (see Porky's 2 and about a million others).
However, this idea is squandered immediately because of the fact that his voice sounds ridiculous, thus giving the whole piece a jokey sort of feel, and it's squandered further because most of what he's saying is delivered in a very patronising manner.
The final twist really puts the tin hat on the piece, as it's thrown in at the last minute without any build up, thus making it impossible to care or be shocked by it.
Never done in film till that point, the plot is as original as it was and still is today, a sheer whimsical reverie to say the least, and is thus very entertaining, much the way you'd assume Allen Konigsborg wanted his films to function- as an imaginative escape from the hum drum banality of this world.
Nonetheless, there are some clear references, with the main pastiche being that all the RKO producers, agents and executives actually went along with the preposterous story of their actor jumping off screen and thus they had to get him back!
(This does make it convenient for Cusack, who thus has to wear only one facial expression for most of the movie.)
Then, he completely misses the Lady's reference to her hormone shots, and thus gets to be bemused by her revelation, with which his line, "She's a he?
As desperately tired as I am of all these awful and cheaply made CGI movies about animals, insects, or both, at least most of them have some basic charm and a few jokes you may actually laugh at, thus in some measure vaguely redeeming themselves.
Early in the story we are treated to a colorful but talky exposition which sets the plot in motion: On the day the Civil War starts, Jim Fisk (Edward Arnold), itinerant peddler, and his partners in crime (Cary Grant and Jack Oakie) devise a scheme to buy cotton cheaply in the South, smuggle it North and sell it at a high price to New England mills, thus launching the career of one of the fabled financial speculators of the 19th century.
Directed by Brent Maddock this was the second sequel to the excellent & likable 90's monster flick Tremors (1990) which is generally considered a bit of a classic, the sequels however thus far are a long way from classic status & while Tremors II: Aftershocks (1996) was decent enough Tremors 3: Back to Perfection continues the downward spiral of diminishing returns.
I realize that those on the fringe, seeking change are not very popular and thus won't have millions to make a glossy movie.
I just don't have a lot to say about this vapid entertainment other than apart from transforming the hapless Joe from a boxer to an American footballer (and thus losing some of the universality of his character), it seems almost a line for line, scene for scene, inferior copy of the much superior original.
It is a weak film full of odd underdeveloped (and thus unexplained) side characters and it contains one of the most unsatisfying (and the biggest 'cop-out') endings ever put on film.
They steal a body from the local morgue, blow its head off with a shotgun, and leave it in the lobby of their hotel, thus the seemingly murderous event will lower the popularity of the hotel and keep the rent in check.
Standard stalk and slash picture, yet well acted and directed, thus making it oddly interesting and watchable, though the violence isn't for the squeamish (especially the director's cut which was originally given an "NC-17" rating).
- The bad guy is seconds from having his goal of blowing up Washington but for some unknown reason he uncuffs himself from the code suitcase and falls to his death.... thus allowing Dolph time to run to the lab and stop the bomb from exploding... gave me a headache trying to make sense of that - Dolph and one of the bad guys are fighting under one of the missiles when it launches and sprays them with superheated fiery compressed flaming exhaust ..... but Dolph picks himself up and fights on - the bad guy demands the poor President (that guy from Jaws)shoot himself on national TV in the graveyard.... but the gun on the headstone is full of blanks... so why not have a secret service guy bump off the President if it would save the country???
She exacts her revenge by stabbing victims with wood slivers, thus marking them, and then sucking them into the ground.
Thus, we end up listening to a prepubescent kid squalling the lines of a damned good song, one that was belted out by three fine singers (Aykroyd, Goodman, and Morton), thus ruining the whole effect.
The ending feels rather weak, as we don't see the transition from Paul to Malcolm McDowell and thus the final scenes haven't been properly set up.
I feel sorry because this movie is NOT one's typical B production...they shot scenes in lavish locations in England, Wales and France, and were thus beyond typical B stuff...
Furthermore, as depicted within the closing scene, there is simply no such thing as rejoining one's formation in the event of finalizing an aerial skirmish, as aircraft frequently fought pitched battles at length, scattering miles away from each other, thus relaying each pilot with the burden of utilizing landmarks and navigations skills as the sole means for finding their way home on an individual basis.
It is this man who tells the story, and it quickly becomes clear that he is a raving lunatic, and thus as reliable as Humbert or M. This has two effects - every scene becomes infected by his madness, is heightened, in terms of colour and composition, by the way he sees the world, which is hightly unstable and schizophrenic, alternately jokey and horribly violent, with certain markers recurring in a kind of dream loop.
But "nobody's ever died from taking 'shrooms before," she's reassured, thus guaranteeing they'll be squealing like stuck piglets before the 90 minutes is up.
This film set in Chicago in 1952 starts ponderously with a voice-over of 'the voice of the city', strangely that of actor Chill Wills (whose voice is more that of a cowpoke or a ranch hand, thus highly unsuitable for this purpose), who then appears in the crime story as a ghostly police sergeant representing the spirit of the city.
The humans of Earth learn, to a somewhat limited degree, the power of the Macross, and are able to escape with a few hundred survivors to the outer reaches of space, thus setting in motion the constant game of cat and mouse between the Zentradi and the humans.
Some Japanese directors have claimed that Japanese animation is actually more of a mix between the detailed still drawings of manga and the fluidity of traditional Western animation, thus it is an art form in and of itself being neither comic book nor cartoon.
It basically consists of the team stopping the Kilrathi from snatching a "Nav-Com" unit that will enable them to target destinations when jumping through wormholes, and thus enable them to hitch a ride to Earth.
The idea of the discrimination against the Pilgrims, and thus the hostility Chris Blair faces, adds an emotional side of film, along with the idea of not acknowledging one's existence after they've died.
While in "Der Blaue Engel", the protagonist is a person who cannot adapt to the world around him, and when he tries, shamefully stumbles and at the end pays his attempts with his life, the main figure in "Der Untertan" is so-to-say the complimentary character: Although born in an aristocratic, high-class family, surrounded by the world-literature and regular house-concerts and thus widely detached from bourgeoisie, he finds out that he may make carrier by breaking out of this status-group isolation in trying to meddle with politics.
It gives nothing to back this claim up with, and thus winds up little more than a limp noodle.
They all seem to have an attitude that their intellect is far superior to almost every one else, and thus they're entitled to whatever they desire, as well as justified in whatever it takes to get it--that's a classic disposition of many criminals, and not a few business leaders, politicians, Internet geeks and so on.
As I mentioned if you're patient you'll appreciate this film, it builds and if you hang on and agree with my review thus far you'll most likely really appreciate this film.
Lorre plays a fallen gentleman who fallen into a bottle and thus into some dicey company, while Greenstreet plays a solicitor who's been a tad too speculative with his trust accounts.
The game is thus: 5 cups are presented, each filled with same coloured liquid.
It's supposed to be a very dramatic moment, but it went a bit too fast and thus didn't have all the punch it -could- have had.
Originally, she actually is *egotistic*, but maybe only thus she can find her way and make things right.
(2) Immediately after the assassination, a promise by Brutus to Antony's servant of safe conduct for Antony, who thus knows when he comes to the Capitol and weeps over Caesar's body, challenging the conspirators to kill him also, that there is no danger of their doing so.
He gets them all on the phone at the same time, thus allowing them to tell their horror stories one by one before sticking it to him.
The romance thus abstracts many of the themes that take place in the film.
In this case, janitor Frank Whaley and popular girl Jennifer Connelly accidentally get locked in a department store overnight, and thus have to reassess their lives (especially when some thugs break in).
Fort Massacre is little known and certainly under seen, thus its reputation has been founded by the casual Western viewer entering into it unaware of what type of character driven film it is.
Maybe Frankenstein just outsmarted Dracula and let the Count kill him, to keep him out till the sun comes out, thus frying him.
I had enjoyed most, if not all of his works that I have seen thus far, with his collaboration with Clint Eastwood nabbing Million Dollar Baby a best picture Oscar in 2005, and his own Crash, which was my movie of the year 2005, winning the same award in 2006.
The badly blotched murder thus eliminates a local Mexican drug gang, who would have done a much better job in covering up the crime, that was the #1 suspect in Michael's murder at the time.
In what is easily the best film of the year thus far, multi-talented up-and-coming Oscar-winning writer/director Paul Haggis (Crash, Flags of Our Fathers, Million Dollar Baby), brings us this intense, intelligent and subtle drama wrapped around a murder mystery.
The slow parts are as empty of event as they are full of reflective atmosphere, and violence is as sudden, intense, and shockingly brief as reality, and thus has a real weight.
As a consequence a plot is hatched to get him and his members on a meaningless trip to Okinawa to sort out a peace-deal between waring factions and thus leaving his "patch" vulnerable to a take-over.
The Los Angeles (later California and now Anaheim) Angels and Washington Senators (now Texas Rangers) began play, thus spreading the pitching talent more thinly.
These types of films tend to spend too little time on the characters, and thus have to rely on superficial plot twists and clichÃ©d conflicts.
Perhaps the reason this film works so well is that instead of dealing with the usual tropes, De Villa restricts his story to three individuals who are suffering isolation in the noise and autonomy of New York City and are thus 'adrift' in a life that seems flat and without a beacon of hope.
The audience cannot possibly expect how this movie turns out, thus achieving the rare quality of total suspense.
Tim Robbins is a veteran trying to find the money to send his kid to college and thus stop him enlisting.
At the prospect of looting and raping militia men, the flabby mayor of the well-to-do provincial nest called Boom volunteers, as he puts it, "to sacrifice" himself: his plan to pretend he has just passed away, thus hoping to convince Olivares to bypass the mourning town, is eagerly adopted by his timorous menfolk.
The film follows Mara, who stops off to go to a pharmacy, but ends up overhearing a killer and thus ends up trying to puzzle out whodunit along with her boyfriend, afraid that she might be in the killers sights.
However, Wander says that he doesn't care, thus begins your journey to do nothing other than seek out and destroy the Colossi.
There are some great scenes such as when the freight train disturbs Vinny's sleep in the early hours of the morning; when Vinny is wearing a white tracksuit and a pair of white sneakers and he slips on mud whilst pushing the car, and thus, his outfit and his suit for the court case is ruined, as a result.
Undoubtedly it leaves them both with plenty of money, but materialism cannot satisfy the itch for a more meaningful life, and thus his contemplation of quitting, to Stephen's despair.
The last shot is of Dushku strapped down in a mental hospital, completely ga ga, and then the epilogue -- the notorious alphabet killer has never been caught and remains at large -- thus clearing the way for a SEQUEL to this meretricious rubbish.
This one seems like a sequel to Submerged, in that Seagal is working as part of a team again (thus meaning that other actors get the bulk of the meaty action sequences) and this movie (sadly) is all over the place (plot-wise) as Submerged.
Technically, it's sound, the performances are OK, the action scenes are fine....i just wish these Direct-to-video releases would tone down the 'filler' plot, thus making the movie easier to understand?
So far as I can tell, it has been the best reviewed film of 2006 as of the first quarter of the year, and nothing else for which I've seen trailers thus far looks likely to unseat it any time soon.
And after we spend the whole movie watching Wayne earnestly trying to solve the mystery, he duplicates the first movie's fatal conceit by announcing himself as a cult conspirator at the very end, thus transforming "Blood Cult"'s dubiety into outright fraudulence; it doesn't just make no sense, it is a frontal assault on the viewer's intelligence.
First, the original happens at high noon, thus the title.
It spreads as wildly and rapidly as the zombie virus in Romero's zombie films, and thus Italian zombie films, too!
The carnage on screen is pretty strong and thus this film cannot be recommended to anyone else than a hardcore fan of the genre.
The "Jupiter Solarization Project" is being undertaken to create a new sun and thus, colonize the moons of Jupiter.
He finally snaps and decides that in order to keep from being taken again, he needs to get someone else to take his place and thus, kidnaps his doctor and takes a travel agency hostage.
Or beating for desire to spend time with the woman the driver loves, whom he meets at the end (the surprise ending, thus explaining the name of Cetait Un Rendezvous).
So I can accept the weak ending, and I'll even accept the analysis of one of the user reviewers here, Richard Burke (or was it Robert) whose analysis struck me as completely reasonable and well though out, and thus accept that the movie more-or-less makes sense.
The movie thus begins in timeline B.
Played almost as a television news special, "Lake Mungo" is the most believable entry thus far.
He faints as a result, thus reminding us that it is a comedy show.
He keeps having the nightmares (thus explaining the name of the movie) and one by one his "Friends" at the house get murdered.
There are no scars on his head thus no brain surgery.
It never transcends its influences, and is thus, in the end, generic and forgettable.
The Hunt for Red October -- the best film adaptation of the Jack Ryan series thus far -- still stands as my favorite film of all time.
There are few other employment opportunities in their small town, and they fear that, if forced to implement stricter safety rules, the company will simply close the plant, thus putting them out of work.
The segments follow a violin for 3 centuries obviously shooting for a wide range of settings, thus a wide range of stories and characters.
And thus brings far more shocks and jolts to his audience back in 1943 then what the best state-of-the-art special effects can do in a movie today.
She pokes fun at every aspect of herself, her life and past experience, but the genius is that at the same times she's broken out of the typecast...  She has proved, thus far, that she can be a strong part of the creative process that yields great television.
Scooby decides that he wants to see the footage that Toby has shot thus far, so he travels into New York City to see him.
Tommy learns all about Shelly's deceased brother Kyle and uses that knowledge to manipulate Michael into , or having his personal psychologist Dr. Wagner, give him a clean bill of health and thus release from the hated, by Tommy, institution.
You may think the theme of a man living his life extravagantly with only weeks to live thus showing us how little time we really have is a tired and overplayed one.
What he uncovers is a pretty clever plot to replace the models with computer generated replicas, thus allowing them to work forever without aging or getting paid.
Belle persuades the Beast to take her instead of her father, and thus the story begins.
But 'The Year My Voice Broke' deals with much more adult situations than simply being a matter of 'puppy love,' and thus some of the results are tragic.
The second item to remember is that the director was not taping a concert, thus explaining why the video jumps around quite a bit and there are very few songs shown being performed from beginning to end.
or "fair and balanced" but Olbermann isn't looking for quotes that can be easily imitated for the masses he is looking for the news and thus the truth.
When madness finally takes control of Seth, and his transformation into 'Brundlefly' is almost complete, the scientist abducts Veronica as she attempts to abort her pregnancy, takes her home to his lab, and pushes her into one of his teleportation pods, his intention being to merge himself with Veronica and their unborn child, thus creating the ultimate family.
Karloff suffered a back problem that required surgery and thus delayed the film for a while and a central female character called Catharine was jettisoned from the original script.
Besides, the deliberate pace does allow for well-rounded characterizations (in all the major parts): especially interesting is the relationship between the Greeks (Karloff and the sinister Helene Thimig allowing superstition to get the better of them, thus distrusting and ultimately threatening innocent Ellen Drew), and also that between paganism (as represented by Jason Robards Sr., who lights a pyre to appease the old gods so that they ward off the plague) vs. science (as represented by Ernst Deutsch, who eventually succumbs to the disease himself).
And if one considers how the story would have played out had the character of Leona been black, she not only would have never been teaching in a white public school, but had she and Mike Frame sought to be married, there likely would have been a response from the community that involved a lynching and thus our moral superiority over the Germans is exposed as being more imagined than real.
