With these typical stars and directors, as well as most everyone else associated with the AMPAS being those who decide who be will be nominated, as well as ultimately winning, Ms. Day's choice of living a less typical Hollywood life style may have had some bearing on her not being nominated for Love Me or Leave Me.

To me, a romantically inclined gay man, this was a fascinating but ultimately unfulfilling tale of a `normal' French couple, Nicole and Jean-Marie Kunstler, who have grown unsatisfied with their settled, routine lives.
(WARNING - CONTAINS MILD SPOILER) The somewhat unresolved nature of the very last scene is ultimately dissatisfying, leaving a feeling that the film may have been inherently overly familiar - a chronicle of a straight- laced, unsatisfied couple who taste forbidden fruit and are almost ruined by it.
It's impossible - for me at least - to know whether or not Ann Fontaine was familiar with Joe Orton's sixties play Entertaining Mister Sloane (subsequently filmed)before writing and directing Nettoyage a sec some thirty years later but it is reasonable to assume that the central premise - bi-sexual catalyst male enters and ultimately disrupts household via sexual encounters with both male and female - is very similar with, in the case of the latter, a Gallic twist.
Their mutual obsession naturally leads to the demise of their relationships, businesses and ultimately their lives.
The whole cast is excellent, and the sensual , open tone of the movie, mixing the fairly straight-laced couple, their young child, middle class friends and family, and the worldly young man and depicting them, ultimately, as not really all that different, is almost comforting...until that ending, which came rather fast and furious after a more slow moving development, shattering the mood.
This powerful exposition ultimately demonstrates how moralist prejudice drives administration of the law in at least parts of the American heartland.
Indeed, we are given some real insights into Stalin's actions that shock and surprise, and ultimately lead to the conclusion that in terms of cruelty and sheer madness, there is little to choose between Hitler or Stalin.

I was also touched by the positive and encouraging words offered by the minister which ultimately had an effect on the main character.
If there is a distinct shrill ringing throughout us as the film plays out, it's because while conforming to gangster genre conventions, we see most of the world and most of the film unfold through the eyes and ultimately with two females: a very young girl and a middle aged woman, two people we feel are under threat and will have harm come to them if they're caught.
Which, ultimately, to me, makes it a pointless affair.
It is just ultimately ridiculous.
A few scenes hinted at some promise to the movie, such as the "blink and you'll miss it" battle against the Ice Dragon, but ultimately these random skirmishes, plus the anti-climactic climax do little to save this movie from the DVD bargain bin.
As a dramatic device, it's too theatrical to entirely work, especially in the clumsy opening reel, but it impinges little on the main drama once the film gets going and ultimately pays dividends, both in the stark poetry and terrible beauty of a scene where Connery's Roald Amundsen recounts his own death and in the final moments which come to some kind of peace with the issues of responsibility, human fallibility and forgiveness.
As Samoilovich, Captain of the Russian Icebreaker Krassin points out, a leader is judged by their actions, and their actions by their results, Nobile's early rescue is the reason the other surviving crewmen are ultimately rescued.
He calls back various participants to the event, to re-live what happened, and ultimately to pass judgment on him.
His motives for rescuing the Nobile over the General's objections that he take the other members of his expedition first, some of whom are badly injured, may have been less than admirable, but it is this act that will ultimately save the others.
I may just be a philistine, but this examination of the lives of European monks ultimately struck me as pointless.
However, this is ultimately not worth watching a nearly three hour film.
In particular, Simon MacCorkindale (more familiar to American audiences from MANIMAL, FALCON CREST, and COUNTERSTRIKE) is a criminally underused actor, and he does a spectacular job here in this, his first movie role, playing the hopeless and hapless Simon Doyle, caught between two captivating women (Lois Chiles and Mia Farrow--wow, what a choice to have) and ultimately driven by greed as he chooses between them.
Yes, this film is quite awful which, I am afraid, is ultimately the director's fault.
When a film with such a reasonable premise is butchered and ultimately ends up dying an ignoble death, my first question was where was the strong hand of the director?
But it is appropriate for her character, a set-to-mature-at-any-moment young woman deficient in some necessary growth hormones needed to push her over the edge (that when triggered by a first kiss could ultimately be her ... undoing) and seems trapped in young adolescence.
But The Out-of-Towners ultimately fails miserably.
But, ultimately, a Steve Martin/Goldie Hawn combination...with a touch of John Cleese...add to a fun movie that will make you laugh out loud!
It's ultimately a sad story with some hope for 2 of the characters.
It was a rebellion that would ultimately lead her reject her parents, their way of life, and their values as absurdly superficial.

Trying to control the political impact of altering history, the captain makes a painful decision that ultimately leads to a happy ending.
From its performances by professional (Oates and Stanton's walk-on) and non (everybody else), to the sturdy visual obsession with the physical prowess of 60s/70s cars, it's ultimately a great movie to just watch by yourself, in your home late at night, and sit and really think about what you saw.
For all her hippiness, she has an acute sense of her own survival, effortlessly transferring her affections to the most promising man of the moment, ultimately leaving with a biker on the basis of a mere glance in a diner.
This is either the best film I've ever seen, or just an interesting exercise in film-making that is ultimately of little value.
Since Gillian does contain a good cast with a notable performance from Danes, I gave it four out of ten stars but the talents of these people are ultimately lost in this poorly written melodrama that might elicit some tears and sighs from the audience, but is mostly a film about a rivalry between in-laws that is devoid of the compassion usually felt after the death of a loved one.
), that when cigars are handed out they'll ultimately explode (check!
There are those who believe it's needless paranoia with no solid scientific data to back it up, while others believe there's either enough evidence on hand to be concerned and ultimately we're better off being safe than sorry.

It is the story of a person who is cruel and merciless, who ultimately comes to realize her own humanity and her own personal power.
I'm a die hard Madonna fan...I mean literally obsessed so i've seen, heard, and read just about everything shes ever done unfortunately i wasn't able to view this film when it originally premiered because of work but thankfully i caught a late night showing of it last night on VH1 hopefully they plan on showing it again cause i'm definitely looking forward to repeat viewings...now i have to say cause its only natural that people will be comparing this movie to "Truth Or Dare" after all they do share some similarities...like they're both documentaries for a Madonna tour..oops sorry but thats where the similarities end...the person Madonna has become is nothing like the person from TOD not that she was a bad person the but her life has changed so much...she's finally experienced some success with her acting (Evita)..she's finally won Grammys(something that should have happened long ago)...shes discovered a newfound spirituality...which i think has a lot to do with the changes i observed...but most of all and most importantly the biggest difference now is that shes a mother...and wife...2 roles that i know lot of people thought she'd never play...but she is and with great success..after almost 5 years of marriage her and Guy act more like close friends than husband and wife and it is truly beautiful to see her interact with her children...even though we don't get to see too much...but i think what was most touching was seeing how more open she is about her emotions and how much kinder she is and ultimately how much happier she is...i thought this movie was beautifully done hell i think the cinematography is award worthy...and there were a couple scenes when she was talking about peace that made me get a little choked up...particularly at the end when she went to Isreal to give a speech about that very subject...well i have to say the biggest difference between the 2 films is that TOD is for fans only...IGTTYAS is one anyone can enjoy or at least learn something from whether fan or not so check your local listings and when it comes out on DVD don't just buy a copy for yourself but for everyone you know
Each scene that involves the "Jerk Magnet" Jamie, (Marguerite Moreau) and her two men, (Naveen Andrews, the hot Persian from "Lost" on ABC, and aka "Kip" in "The English Patient", Juliette Binoche's hot Indian stud); and Bryan F.O'Bryne as the lovable talk show host are all equally heartbreaking, warm, and humorous, ultimately human.
It's just a very realistic look at a 20-something woman struggling with growing up and being used by men...until she learns she can control her own choices, her body and ultimately her destiny.
There are moments of excitement but it is ultimately a riveting one man show which only an actor of Heston's calibre can pull off.

Not everyone would ultimately go to his extremes, perhaps, but nonetheless....
The direction gets a little quirky at times, perhaps thanks to its comic book heritage, with a handful of manic or ridiculous fantasy/daydream sequences, but ultimately, this is a straightforward work and it doesn't really falter where it counts.
Instead, it's ultimately forgettable.
Although it contained several points of interest I was not greatly impressed with the audio commentary; on the other hand, I was greatly impressed with two bonus interviews and particularly so by subject Kitty Fisher, a Jewish woman who recounts how a homosexual prisoner came to her aid--and whose advice ultimately saved her life.
Some, among them is a half-Jewish gay resistance fighter who posed as a Hitler Youth member to rescue his lover from a Gestapo transfer camp in an ultimately futile effort; Annette Eick, the Jewish lesbian who escaped to England with the help of a woman she loved; the German Christian photographer who was arrested and imprisoned for homosexuality, then joined the army on his release because he "wanted to be with men" and Pierre Seel, the French Alsatian teenager, who watched as his lover was eaten alive by dogs in the camps.
While this film about gay men who were persecuted and imprisoned under the Nazi regime, is in many respects absorbing, the film ultimately suffers from an overly narrow and constricted focus.

But under the comedy and sweetness I have always thought there was a disturbing undertone of extreme pessimism--just what kind of ugly and cruel society do we live in, in which the mermaid Madison's only prospect is that she will be tortured, from which Hanks' character ultimately has to flee, never to see his beloved brother again?
CAUTION -- MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILERS --  I put this film roughly in the same category as "Pleasantville" and "The Truman Show", in that they require you to suspend disbelief to show how, ultimately, it is better to really live and love then die, rather than live a "perfect" and protected life.
It deals with some of the most elemental, and difficult, issues we ultimately most face in our lives.
That said, what ultimately makes Nikita work as well as it does is lead Anne Parillaud as Nikita.
Too many flaws get in the way of what could have been a great movie: the overdone moments of unfunny comic relief, the uninspired performances, and the confused political message make for an ultimately superficial caricature of the epic Western.
The film also features in a supporting role the actor who, for all intents and purposes, replaced Gabin in French filmgoers' minds as the brooding action hero, Lino Ventura, but it's Annie Girardot (as a neglected but ultimately self-sacrificing wife) and Jean Desailly (as her impotent, mother-fixated artist husband) who leave the best impression in the crowded supporting cast.
I found myself delighted, beguiled, enchanted, crushed and ultimately reduced to a drained and empty shell by the film's end; it took several days thereafter to fully recover.
Aaron Eckhart and Matt Molloy are pitch perfect as the chauvinist, attractive, and ultimately evil Chad and the nerdy, pathetic, and ultimately emotionally doomed Howard.
In their pursuit of this innocent woman, they wine and dine her, and ultimately humiliate her in such a way that can only be describes as inhuman.
At the helm of the movie, Chow Yun Fat demonstrates magnificent acting skills as he is able to act in all types of characters, from being a man trapped in a child-like state, to ultimately being the "God of Gamblers".

), and Hadley ultimately is very good as the forgery expert who is the Baron's downfall.

He manages to make Cosmo have both of those sides and ultimately sympathetic as well.
The above, does strongly compromise the whole movie, but what ultimately destroys it, is the gunshot wound.
In the final sequence, our hero attains an almost Buddhist-like sense of the inevitability of his fate, the sweetness of the immediate moments of satisfaction that are his last few , his realization that there is, ultimately, nothing to regret except the finite.
I think the film is longer than it need be and is ultimately unable to deal with the deeper issues it alludes to.
A long puzzle (3 hrs in the version I saw), but ultimately not feeling too long.
Michael Redgrave is wordy and unctuous as the British journalist, Fowler, who is having an affair with a beautiful but ultimately vacuous Vietnamese girl, Phuong (Giorgia Moll).
The American, on the other hand, is painfully honest in a charismatic but ultimately empty way.
Fowler at least understands himself and his depravity, whereas the American just seems to understand empty concepts like self-determination and national longings without any hint of introspection or where those fine words ultimately must lead.
With its gritty and raw feel, but ultimately feminist point of view, it has a fair bit going for it.
Lochary is funny, sincere, scared and ultimately empathetic as the helpless, brainwashed victim of the implacable force which is the Lady Divine.

Jake is not as happy as he would have liked to be either, and before too long, the feelings he harbors for Rebecka ultimately drive his wife away.
This Hitchcock film, made soon after he burst into prominence in America with films like "Rebecca" and "Suspicion," is a lot of fun, but it's ultimately more of a technical experiment than it is a satisfying narrative film, much like "Rope" would be 4 years later.
It is ultimately hubris, the kind of overconfidence normally associated with '80s excess, that delivers Shand helplessly into the maw of a truly monstrous enemy that had existed for decades.
result in a light and ultimately charming little movie.
While "Zelig" has its moments, it is ultimately tedious, running about twice as long as it's one-note gag treatment can sustain.
Obviously the pilot had a lot of loot dumped into it, and I imagine that subsequent episodes would have to be scaled back a bit, but ultimately I really enjoyed it.
"Teresa de JesÃºs" is a jewel of Spanish cinema, with Concha Velasca playing the role of Teresa of Avila (for this is how most of us know her), mystic and, ultimately, Doctor of the Church.
I found the historical content and some of the dialogue pleasing, but it became ultimately pointless.
This is a very poor imitation of spaghetti westerns such as 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly', and Wallach tries hard - but ultimately fails - to successfully re-create a Tuco-style character here.
inside a warehouse with a machete(..he's considered a suspect, but anyone in their right mind knows that the film will ultimately end at the drive-in).
A group of my friends & I enjoy nothing more than film nights which include a wide variety of good and bad films; all ultimately just fodder for us to critique, but features like this one really help break up the monotony of current Hollywood sensibilities and political correctness.
"Adrian" was truly the star of the film for his ultimately extravagant gowns (1250 of them) and the black-and-white photography lost none of the sumptuousness - even the men were beautifully costumed.
But ultimately it's a Michael Winner movie, so, eh.
The uncomfortable outside scenes (constant drizzle) and the always claustrophobic interiors amplify the story perfectly, as Paul loses money, keys, is mistaken for a burglar and is ultimately chased through SoHo by a vigilante mob Â AFTER HOURS is often hilarious, and relentless, with precious few moments of relaxation provided.
This kitschy blaxploitation film was originally intended as a serious movie, which (ultimately) earns it some points in the camp department.
So ultimately it's a film that has no specific target audience, this in spite of some lazy observationists trying to lump it in with the formulaic stalker genre.
So ultimately this movie looks like somebody decided that it might be a cool idea to point a camera at two girls and an older guy and see what happens.
Perhaps she has sold out to the conservative ideals that seemed so repulsive to them at the beginning of the movie, but just as Enid ultimately fulfils her desires, so does Becky live out her 'seventh grade fantasy'.
Set in a grim and menacing depiction of Los Angeles, Crime Wave is a dark, brutal, stylish, and ultimately unique film within the genre.
Directed by Irving Pichel, Colbert and Welles are great fun to watch; with their fine performances, you can read some ambiguity into the film's ultimately flawed storyline (which has to do with recognition).
This is very grim stuff but also an extremely moving and thought-provoking look at what human beings in the most miserable of circumstances will do to stay alive, and how through it all they sustain their desire to ultimately fight back.
The story, however, was ultimately a downer.
This throws Grace into a rage that affects her family, her family's typical Southern response to appearances, and ultimately awakens not only Grace but also every member of her family to secrets that allow them to take charge of their prettified hollow lives!
In any event, the film is ultimately about the love and  strength of family relationships and the power of forgiveness, as  well as finding one's own path in life.
Meanwhile, Allen has his sort of guardian angel/devil in one at his ear, Humphrey Bogart, pecking away at him to be more than what he is, as he's ultimately the most impressive man in Allen's life, particularly after seeing Casablanca.
Caper movies are among my favorites (maybe, it's because I work in a bank) but this is a very mild addition to that exciting thriller subgenre Â chiefly because of an unconvincing plot also involving child kidnapping, a counter robbery from a church to mislead the Israeli police, the gang donning a series of silly disguises and, ultimately, a burglary which remains unfulfilled (again, a fashionable twist in the cynical 1970s but rather ludicrous in this context!
As a result, we're able to witness the step-by-step process by which that infamous shot of the naked men stacked in a pyramid formation ultimately came about.

Good action, decent cast and a fun atmosphere go a long way with Travolta ultimately holding it all together.
This movie  has a similar feel--It's unsettling at first, but ultimately presents  itself as a curiously wonderful juxtaposition of warmth and  coldness; interrelation and alienation.
The first part takes up most of the film, in gripping intensity (and yes, no porn at all) it builds an incredible tension - and then we get a maybe oversimplified, but ultimately satisfying solution.

This time, his actions and sacrifice ultimately protect his ex-wife.

In Bramley End, a pretty good (and ultimately successful) fight was put up once the locals got over their shock, and the fight involved men, women and children; soldiers and civilians alike.

If one really finds nothing to like in La cittÃ  delle donne, it's ultimately still an important document on the gender battles that recent humanity has crossed.
So in terms of historical accuracy Che falters and ultimately that leads to the dearth and want of something a little more cerebral and provocative rather than an exercise in cinematic and narrative technique, however laudable that is.
With Che Part One Soderbergh ultimately does Guevera a disservice by sanitizing him and in doing so sucks the vitality and complexity out of a man who by his accomplishments had a lot more about him than is said in this ponderous quagmire of a film.
A romantic, yet tragic story about the relationship between 3 sisters which would ultimately shape the future of China.
The film begins with a sweet young lady being kidnapped but ultimately escaping from these thugs.

A college prank where one got caught and sent to prison and the other didn't forms the basis for Sneakers, a stylish, but ultimately unsatisfying thriller.

While I found it ultimately disappointing, it was a nice attempt at being different.
In Downfall he played the role of Hitler, In Wings of desire he was an angel wandering in streets of Berlin and listening to different people's thoughts, In Phantom of night he played the role of a young man who is somehow unemotional and cold and ultimately causes Cont Dracula come to town.
These two current movies both have boy protagonists (Joshua is eleven and a half and Vitus is ultimately twelve) who happen to be both intellectually brilliant and piano prodigies.

Despite splinters of wooden dialogue and the obvious, yet ultimately satisfying, use of the music of Van Morrison early in the proceedings, the movie moves past both and bowls audiences over with poignant performances and stunning visuals in a first-class production.
But will she ultimately triumph?

Franco Basaglia, the revolutionary psychiatrist whose humane and futuristic ideas ultimately shut down Italian asylums in 1979, is mentioned later on as Nicola's role-model but the movie is never preachy or self-righteous about this.
I am a hard core liberal, but I could not stand Shake Hands With The Devil, a well-meaning but ultimately stupid documentary about the Rwandan genocide of 1994.
One can believe in these characters and their difficulties, and it ultimately comes to matter little that this is the 1660s.
With BOX, he ultimately disappoints with the ending.
The combination of the basic plot and Di Leo at the helm, knowing that his films are rarely pretty, ensures that the film is a gritty, sometimes necessarily unpleasant, but ultimately very satisfying exploitation film viewing experience.
Although there are memorable performances in this film, it is Peter Cushing's work as Dr. Knox that ultimately stands out.

They spent a little money making this flick, but ultimately it doesn't quite pass the test, even for a standard thriller.

This time out, perhaps just for being another decade out post-existentialism, her labyrinth of expatriate German adventurers in exotic Spain ultimately feels oddly somewhat less fresh or less fully emotionally engaging but nevertheless is a solid and intellectually engaging new set of contexts and characters through which to examine more turns of the die.
Eleanor Parker, his female foil and romantic interest is very blase and dutifully unthespian like as the temptress who ultimately falls for the hero.
This movie is about their arrogance and ultimately about how they deal with the discovery that perfection is a little more elusive than they thought.
The action sequences are very lively, riveting and exciting; two highlights are a stirring chase between a wheat thresher and a Trans Am in a corn field and a wild lengthy set piece towards the end which starts out as a foot chase and ultimately culminates into a car chase (the whole sequence on a speeding subway train totally smokes).
Very hard to follow and ultimately more distracting than anything.
This film tackled a theme that was very much taboo in Indian Cinema, and succeeds in presenting a mature, yet never over-the-top, nor didactic story that ultimately every Indian household can identify with.
The viewers are compelled to admit the follies and bitter treatment meted out to an innocent woman who ultimately resorts to find refuge in the filthy side of the world.
The second half is more curious, and ultimately more disturbing.
Almost every secondary storyline is poorly developed and ultimately unneeded.
He's doing what he feels is right, but ultimately, the ends don't justify his means.

I was very disappointed and ultimately, bored by this slight joke movie lampooning what should be a sure fire winner comedy.
It is not even hard to say where he has gone wrong: the characters he created before were quirky, offbeat, but ultimately lovable.
Guest uses his usual company of actors (Catherine O'Hara, Parker Posey, etc) and they seem to have a good time making fun of themselves ultimately.
Yes, there are funny moments, but the further the movie plods the less funny the moments become and ultimately the result of the 'rumor of greatness' shows us the shallow lives of the sad sack troupe of actors and producers and writers that started out with a pretty awful idea.
The performances are good, especially on behalf of the charming O'Hara, but are ultimately forgettable.
It is a brave, and ultimately, a rewarding choice for a director who has built his impeccable reputation on the strength of his mockumentaries.
Rue des Plaisirs takes its sweet time setting its story up, but it all moves very quickly, pace-wise, and the simplicity and beauty of the images is wonderful, and the little fable is ultimately very touching.

It's blandly amusing watching Van Dien plug away ineptly at both his heroics and English accent, though this is ultimately an empty diversion for completest only.

Locke's words and Jack's wild goose chase ultimately lead him to accept his role as leader with complete confidence.
You see, Liv has enjoyed some success as a lawyer while Emma is an underpaid schoolteacher, and ultimately Liv's sense of entitlement combined with Emma's decision that she's just not gonna take it anymore set up the escalating conflict that takes up the rest of the movie, but from here there's nowhere else to go except down the well-trodden path of half-assed romantic comedies.
Both scenes were well-conceived but ultimately came up short in terms of just how fun they wound up being, especially after considering the comedic talents of both Hudson and Hathaway.
With this in mind, Bride Wars becomes an intriguing example of Hollywood's prevailing treatment of the 'wedding film' subgenre - while its premise initially suggests a critique and send up of the lavish excesses of popular weddings, the film can ultimately not avoid caving to syrupy clichÃ© and delivering an adoring treatment to the social institution it initially promised to challenge.
Everything else is just like Liv and Emma: obsessed with getting everything right, but ultimately too self-centered to get any sympathy from others.
It's not entirely silly sabotage and witless laughs as a few scenes and characters do stand out of the clichÃ© wedding comedy crowd, but ultimately the tragic outcomes and easy clean-up of a far too messy situation will leave viewers wishing for a more comfortably predictable plot line.
Writer-director Dan Clark (who plays the head criminal) wants us to think he's crafting a deliberately self-conscious homage to B-cinema, but ultimately doesn't have the dumb 'luck' of an Ed Wood to convey it at all proper.
DOC HOLLYWOOD is full of charming vignettes, from Stone vicariously reading the mail for an illiterate farm couple, to being paid for services rendered with a rather large pig, who ultimately becomes his 'pet'.
I would just like to put thinks clear, because truly, sometimes a movie tries to hard to accomplish its objective but it ultimately fails.
Are we able to really choose for ourselves, or are we just imagining that we can but are ultimately controlled by "fate".
She runs into a building under construction, and goes up the stairs, where she will ultimately run out of stairs and room to run.
Money, machine (car, cell phone), and the unhappy institutions of employment and marriage have let him down; he may return to his marriage ultimately, but it will be under completely different understandings.
Although this is a classically executed Film-Noir, it is a slow-moving and ultimately disappointing film.
Though at times hard to watch, the film is ultimately a provocative exploration of the human condition under great duress.
The Story of Us, is a complex, yet ultimately simple, explanation of long term relationships...all those 'little' things about the other person that drive you insane about them, but that if you're both willing to work on, make the relationship all that much richer for it.
I could pick a couple of points in the script which could have done with more development and resolution, but ultimately this is exactly the kind of film Scotland should be producing, and I'm shocked that it hasn't received more media attention here.
But the movie provides a window onto contemporary life in China, with its focus upon villagers in the city, the consuming quality of subsistence--daily struggle, family and local cruelties--and the appeal of movies as escape, fantasy, and, ultimately, as source of community.
Initially,the idea of Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson appearing together in a film called Anger Management looks good on paper.Unfortunately,what makes this a bad film is that the idea wasn't carried out very well.The story goes along smoothly enough,but what ultimately kills it is a it's totally ridiculous and disappointing ending.The whole idea that all of Dave's situations were staged as part of his therapy brought a very promising idea crashing to the ground with a thud.Perhaps Adam and Jack will make another film together one day,the story idea will be a good one,and this time the idea will be carried out a little better.Sandler has hits and he has misses.For me,this one goes down as a miss.
There's a lot of historical, literary, and biblical allusions which add to the complexity of the movie, and ultimately I think it adds depth and helps us to understand the transformations of the characters.
It's much more sombre and serious and ultimately quite sad.
Even when Jafar completely forgives him, and appears to have won him back, Iago, without cause or reason, SETS FREE the genie and is ultimately the one who kills Jafar.

Sadly, she was never again to be so sublimely bitchy and was ultimately fated to throwing rubber lizards at a monkey-man in "Trog" only fifteen years after "Queen Bee", in a drunken last performance.
There was a time, after the excellent opening, that I was leaning more towards putting this film in the interesting, but deeply flawed category Rottweiler and Faust are in, but ultimately for me the good far outweighed the bad.
I personally liked the setup a lot more then the execution of the rest of the movie.the beginning started out pretty well with some interesting team ghost seeing but ultimately failed due to disjointed story telling, and decent CG effects.
(After all, the Israelites wander in the wilderness for forty years after that, and Moses ultimately is not allowed to enter the Promised Land--perhaps not the uplifting ending the filmmakers had in mind.)
While a decent enough sequel, Ring 2 is a bit of a disappointment in that it tries to weave too many threads and characters, tries to have too much going on and too many characters and ultimately gets a bit muddled and incoherent towards the end.
'Ring 2' is not only much deeper than it's predecessor, it's also a scarier and ultimately better film.
Esther grasps the picture, but does not have the social power to act sufficiently on it, so finds herself ultimately trapped.
And, yet, ultimately the film draws to a wonderful and fitting conclusion.
Taking the role in her mouth and shaking it into submission, she is playing, ultimately, another facet of Joan herself.
If this is true, then, as viewed through the looking glass of time, that snake's brave and noble sacrifice was ultimately in vain.
This was a very ingeniously performed routine that took a shot at all the ills of pop-culture, the morbid curiosity of your average person, and ultimately the extreme human behavior(exclusive to us so-called "civilized" beings) that shows how primitive we really are...  And for those of you that don't think there's punchlines how 'bout when he talks 'bout "scarfing" and throws in the pun, "think of how many kids are trying to pull this one off" Also he touches on several current topics like obesity, stupidity, and consumerism that are just becoming too much of an issue to ignore, I mean the whole "pretty soon all you'll need to get into college is a pencil" is so true, I mean I know that i'm not as "enlightened" or "educated" as I should be and I know that if I had the same study habits/dedication towards school just 20yrs ago there's no way I'd be able to get a college degree but now i'm just a couple months away from graduating college, just going to show that they're definitely lowering the standards, I mean I'm no dummy either, but still, getting into and graduating college is becoming less of a big deal 'cause the best way to help "educate" the ppl is to lower the standards....
However, the film does not choose to present its views in a sentimental or even subjective manner, which makes its points about history and ultimately ourselves all the more poignant.
It turns out to cost one of them his life ultimately.
The story is touching, sometimes side-splittingly funny, sometimes tragically upsetting, but ultimately uplifting.
I think this documentary also shows, unintentionally, why they ultimately failed.
On the surface, it is ugly and repulsive; but just like it's title character; the movie has a hidden depth that is ultimately touching and heartbreaking.
Pomerance's tale is a tragic one showing us how Merrick becomes caught in the machinery of the repressive and hypocritical society that cultivates him, tempting him with the illusion of normality with the artificial world they erect around him, but ultimately imprisoning him within it.
There is some(even subtly sexual)awkwardness between Merrick and Kendall at the beginning of their meeting together but it ultimately winds up with a scene that feels patronizing towards Merrick and mawkish.
And yet at that moment in the restaurant when Lenny breaks the news to Lila over that half-slice of pecan pie, our hearts just break for her, and Lenny's feeble, yet honest (although ultimately self-serving) attempt to comfort her also touches us, as does Kelly's joie de vivre and passion for Lenny, and her parent's obvious conflicting feelings of protection, love and knowing they have to let go.
It is too long and tedious at times but ultimately fascinating.
Though admittedly unsavoury, I also find such elements to be archetypically symbolic, and ultimately fascinating.
In consequence, SATYRICON is ultimately less about any philosophical statement Fellini may have had in mind than it is about sheer pictorial splendor and deliberate weirdness.
I've read some early reviews that the movie is ultimately cold --a common Fincher rap.
In this light The Curious Case of Benjamin Button is a fascinating yet ultimately very hollow film.
It's a meditation on life, death, time, fate, forgiveness, love and every emotional experience in between; most often it's beautiful, melancholy, romantic and saddening, but ultimately it suffers from the futility of a predestined course.
With "Button", Fincher cements his place as one of the best directors alive, as his film is nothing short of magical, mesmerizing, riveting, ground breaking, and ultimately, timeless.
The action sequences are incredibly well staged and delivered, but so exceedingly violent that it passes beyond reality at times (especially during the climax) into a somewhat surreal state of being, only to be ultimately drawn back in again by the grounded core of the story.
Your ability to ignore such distractions will ultimately determine if you give this a 5 or a 9.
It is a more solid film than the original, more layered and ultimately more rewarding.
I'm not sure if this is among the best of Keaton's films... but it's certainly one of those I've ultimately enjoyed the most so far.

Well, it's complicated, and ultimately for director NicolÃ¡s EchevarrÃ­a may have been unimportant.
This is one surefire case where the unavailability of a film (even if I did catch it, on local TV of all places, in the mid-1980s) turns it into a cult which is ultimately undeserving!
However, ultimately, it's a disappointing, sometimes mildly amusing, hypocritical, smug documentary that is nevertheless not totally devoid of value about an important subject.
The film really doesn't develop this idea enough, or, hardly at all actually, and devotes much too much time to trying to debate the truth or falsity of ID itself, which, in my view, is either (a) something that reasonable minds can and do differ upon or (b) completely incoherent babble, ultimately, on both sides of the debate.
There is some value to seeing this, but it is ultimately a pretty childish documentary that will insult the very people it claims to most want to influence--the pro-ID camp.
Completely laughable depiction of three private-school girls who, fed up with the domination boys have over them, decide on some violent revenge that ultimately backfires on them.
Besides, a lot of 10+01's humour is very tongue-in-cheek, which ultimately means it's very entertaining.

Sure, he had a tough life, but ultimately, he executed a cop and was a menace.
George Macready is excellent as well as the scarred, evil, but ultimately vindicated prosecutor.
What ultimately saves the film and actually makes it rather special is the romance between Romano and Emma (Allene Roberts).
In addition, the relationship itself introduces a nice irony as it is the pressure to make Emma proud of him and to tangibly demonstrate his love that ultimately leads Romano back to crime.
I felt the best Hulkout in the movie was what was ultimately revealed to be David Banner's nightmarish dream of being on trial, aggravated and provoked by the D.A.

Almost entirely shot in India, Outsourced is a truly tiny movie that ultimately says a lot about troubles crossing cultural divisions.
Olivia de Havilland, as Marian, is somewhat ill-served by her period costume - she is at her most beautiful in this scene, without her hair confined in her wimple - but together they duel their way through a classic tempestuous romance of the high-born lady and the outlaw, ultimately risking their lives to save each other.

Vlad the Impaler, that is the son of Vlad Dracul, inherited his father's membership into the order of the Dragon, but because he was the son of Dracul, he was named "Draculea", or "Dracula", which means "son of Dracul", son of the Dragon, and ultimately son of the devil.
This is proved right off the bat with 'Voice', where Magnani, for 75 percent of the film's running time, is in either medium-close up or close-up by Rossellini's elegant, probing (without seemingly to try) lens, as Magnani's character has a long, painful, and ultimately confessional conversation with her love who has left her.
The morbid attempt at retribution from Alonzo towards Malabar(who is planning a certain stunt regarding horses pulling his arms on treadmills)will ultimately spell his doom.
The characters are disfunctional, interesting and ultimately lovable.
But it's not exactly that bleak, either: the strength, the resolve of the son, as well as the damaged, semi-paranoid character played by Lindo -- both these men cannot be forgotten, and neither can ultimately be seen as tragic figures.
It is in the latter that we definitely feel the struggle, violence, growth and pride of Joao Francisco dos Santos as a strongly driven heterosexual man that ultimately yields to his comfort in cross-dressing while maintaining a jagged, devoted relationship with Laurita and her/his child.
Then, when it switches gears bit by bit and the paranoia increases, by the time the climax comes it becomes very, ultimately, tragic.

Like most films, the primary focus of DeMille's 1935 film The Crusades is to entertain the viewer, which it ultimately does and does not at the same time.
It's fairly disgusting as it studies some weird necrophiliac fantasies and the story is interesting, but it becomes a bit muddled as it goes through and is ultimately forgettable.

It will make you laugh, and you will ultimately feel for the characters.
This unprecedented American withdrawal was a huge temporary defeat for our forces and ultimately led to the surrender of US and Philippine troops to Japan.
Almost needless to say, but the production design and cinematography are sterling, with warm and inviting environments (including an absolutely gorgeous Seoul) a veritable extension of the optimism with which these characters ultimately face their uncertain future.

Although he showed talent in administration from an early age, he also was quite adept at angering his father, Charles VII, and ultimately had to take refuge at the Burgundian court until the time of his succession to the throne.
The other most interesting one is Vampire Lovers, which keeps far closer to the plot of the book and has a more sustained sense of mood and atmosphere, but ultimately is undone by an actress who is far too old to be believable as the Lolita with fangs that Le Fanu imagined long before anyone had ever heard of Vladimir Nabokov.
Though this film is ultimately forgettable, the saving grace is a savory morsel in the form of a cameo appearance by Jon Craig Liebling.
The support of the story, which is Davis's struggle to be independent of society's taming and manipulation is what is ultimately compelling and infuriating, very effectively putting us in her mad, aggressive shoes.
The framework involving the attraction between her and Neill is what is ultimately moving and hearty.

Morgan is outstanding as the sympathetic white traveler who ultimately is the town's salvation.
Its second theme Â and the one that ultimately trumps the first Â involves the rescue of a little black girl (and parallels, minus the cynicism, Billy Wilder's Ace in the Hole/The Big Carnival of the same year).
The clever marketeer is he is, Jess Franco naturally also cashed in on the huge temporarily success of psychedelic spy movies like Mario Bava's ultimately sensational "Danger: Diabolik!".
It's snappy, fast-paced, glamorous, sexy, sophisticated, funny, and ultimately tragic.
John Barrymore, suave, sophisticated & ultimately tragic.

We sense their fear and pessimism as they struggle to survive in this breathtakingly beautiful, yet ultimately deadly landscape.

Judy Garland's troubled but ultimately engrossing and hugely entertaining remake was already familiar to me.
This movie resonates so much with me because I know many little, ultimately insignificant, "hard men" like those shown here, the big fish in little ponds who would not last 5 minutes outside their comfort zone.
The reason Screwed is so funny and ultimately works well as an overall film can be credited, in a very large part, to the perfect casting.
THE NAILGUN MASSACRE is a dull snooze-fest that only has a few "gory" (but ultimately) cheezy scenes that are nothing to write home about, and a few lame nude scenes to it's credit.
Yes, a filmmaker with passion and patience deserves applause but ultimately the film needs to back that up.
This is an excellent and powerful film, which ultimately imparts a sense of tenderness and peace without ever becoming mawkish.

The gang upon whom Richard takes revenge are at times touching, farcical, disgusting, pitiable but ultimately human.
The film's stars, Anthony "ER" Edwards and Mare "Georgia" Winningham, embody a welcome change from the typical Hollywood "beautiful people" leads, and share a great chemistry portraying tentative new lovers who ultimately share a decidedly unusual courtship.
Indeed, its this mostly-unknown treasure trove of aunts, uncles, cousins, in-laws, and old acquaintances in multiple countries who ultimately provide as much material in collective form as the various museums and associations of magicians Miller also consults.
Life is more complicated, difficult and, ultimately interesting than anything Hollywood can conjure which is why documentaries can be so spellbinding.
'Caught in the Act' is embarressing and ultimately very forgettable.
The quartet is harmonious in literary pursuits and drastic life changes when the parents agree on separating sending the boys (and ultimately themselves) into an emotional tailspin.
He has a keen touch with his actors Â especially Daniels, the centerpiece character, who is brilliantly funny, touching and head-shaking misanthropic at the absurdity of his situation (at one point he says glibly with a touch of melancholy, "that's my home which I used to live inÂas you may know", to his son during one of their jaunts back and forth) that has echoes of his first fine role as Flap, the philandering English professor husband of the doomed Debra Winger in "Terms of Endearment", suggesting a bookend to what Flap may have become ultimately (and I'm damned if I'm not right at one point Walt is looking at his father's novel's backflap and the photo suggests a still from that film!).
Anyway, this film is extremely fast moving (almost too much so for its own good), covering a lot of ground in just 95 minutes, and ultimately gets a tad soapy in its final 1/3, when Anna gets involved with the surgeon who saves her son's life.
But they ultimately have the same goal in mind.
And the extraordinary Geraldine Page giving conviction and ultimately a scary poignancy to the role of the murderess.
Gordon had won her Oscar for "Rosemary's Baby" the year before, and Page would ultimately win one for "The Trip to Bountiful."
Initially, London is shot in the manner you might expect from a Frenchman, what with shots of Big Ben, the London Eye and the Houses of Parliment but I think the inclusion of these things is more about getting across the sense of the familiar; of the everyday and, ultimately, of the mundane.
This film was about her exclusively, from her POV, about what was going on in her mind...ultimately the creative process of writing.
It's about storytelling, fiction, and ultimately fear of failure.

The movie opens with Paw and his pals hunting a tapir (basically a wild boar) and this initial episode ultimately foreshadows the dramatic finale.
To the Christian zealots who say "This is a film about the horrors of the Mesoamerican world and how the arrival of Europeans and the Christian faith that motivated them ultimately put an end to that paganistic hell on earth.
But I really will never know because if he is in fact making a point such as the one I have guessed at in 3., he fails in his utter vagueness and leaves us with a film that is ultimately disappointing, if not entirely offensive!

His mother, played surprisingly well by Cher, is short tempered and morally questionable, but is ultimately determined to help Rocky live as good a life as normal.
Mask is something we don't see in cinemas anymore: An "inspirational" true story that doesn't force it and ultimately, succeeds in making you feel good and even tugs your heart strings a bit.
A little slow and studied, but very worthwhile and ultimately moving.
I still am marveling at the choice of Ian Holm as the crazy and ultimately destructive Pascal, but it definitely worked in the film.
The film follows the career of this heroic pilot and his comrades, including Crocker who ultimately becomes his observer.
Delia, Frank's wife and ultimately ex-wife, and Roger's wife and ultimately ex-wife, and a royal pain, was played by both Randall Edwards and Ilene Kirstin, more successfully by Kirstin, in my opinion.
The story actually survives to the end where an act of conscience ultimately determines the outcome.
Without giving anything away, the other element running through the film is an amazing tale of, ultimately, redemption involving Boomer and Cleveland.
Novak makes a stunning debut as the ultimately luckless moll and the rest of the cast backs them up with a splendid ensemble effort.
If I were to make a film about the power of dreams, I doubt I would start with a real-life story of a dreamer who ultimately failed because he had nothing BUT dreams.
Rather than monkey around too much with the relevant (and ultimately disheartening) facts of the Tucker Motor Company's short existence, Lucas and Coppola took all the incidentals of the filmÂthe characters, the subplots, the sets, the costumesÂand skewed, streamlined, generalized and idealized them to the point of subtly but clearly communicating the filmmakers' intent that this be viewed as a morality play, not an historical account.
In some ways the story is something like "Rocky I" building up hopes and even demonstrating worthiness & success, but ultimately overcome by the entrenched establishment.
In some ways the story is something like "Rocky I" building up hopes and even demonstrating worthiness & success, but ultimately overcome by the entrenched establishment.
And, ultimately, both men didn't quite live up to the dream.
STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs  Nowhere To Run carefully conveys some touching,poignant moments,absent from every other Van Damme film except Legionnaire,but clumsily portrays them.The charecter development is poorly worked out,with potentially great charecters to build on either being killed off too early,or too quick to shed their skin.More of the film Van Damme obviously concentrated on being more dramatic,but ultimately the action scenes are as usual,especially so at the end,what take over,but again,this is too rapidly conveyed to have any real lasting effect,other than to do what any other basic Van Damme film would do.For a truely dramatic break from the norm,Legionnaire remains the Van Damme film to talk about.
Sam is mistrusting, awkward but ultimately striving to be a decent person.
Betty as Cinderella was certainly fitting-after all, Cinderella did ultimately become a princess when she married the prince and Betty Boop is cartoon royalty.
However, it is ultimately unfair to compare the Fleischer Studio output with that of Disney.
This is truly gripping and ultimately tragic horror film.
Ponderous handling of the material by Rydell but with Midler's gut wrenching performance it becomes a film that is ultimately unforgettable.
Kirk Douglas plays the gentleman caller who ultimately rejects the daughter during their blind date and makes up a story about being engaged to blow her off as gently as possible.
I felt the filmmakers presented the facts, but ultimately lets the viewer judge Peter Berlin and draw our own conclusion; is he crazy, or merely the quaint and eccentric archetype you'd expect to find in San Francisco?
It addresses so many issues but ultimately it is about art and narcissism.
The story (two characters, each alientated in his/her own way, thrown together in a Parisian apartment building)is ultimately trite and uninteresting.
To be certain part of the problem is that speed was required, Behemoth had a limited budget so it had to be done fast as possible, but ultimately O'Brien wasn't that creative an animator (he may have been the father of the technique but his children made it into something).
That said "Behemoth" is ultimately more entertaining with it's challenging fx than many of our modern day films which completely lack any charm.
Eventually, Karnes begins to adopt a more diplomatic manner, ultimately suggesting rather than demanding that a torpedo be the ideal means of destroying the Behemoth.
Thus, begins a timely drama which means life or death for the hero, the president and ultimately the world.
I think possibly some might not get the accents, or indeed the feel of the film - ultimately, to really enjoy the film, you have to have lived in Swansea to get the most out of it, as if you have, a particular location or character will tie in with certain memories you have of the place, whereas otherwise, it might not.
Then ultimately you will be justly rewarded by film's end because this is one of the few, and I do mean few, American remakes (and a comedy no less) that is worth watching time after time!
Several times during the movie I was reminded of a young Stallone in the way that Rane comes across as a flawed everyman, forced into his actions but ultimately believing that he is doing the right thing.
It's ultimately more fatal and destructive for a married man to be addicted to sex while he is supporting a family.
Mainstream Hollywood tends to specialise in searing emotional dramas designed to make its audience shed tears - but the fact that everything here is presented completely raw means that the audience is left to make their own minds up; which has apparently left some viewers unaffected - but it was what ultimately made the film so powerful for me.
She is abused like this for 3 months until ultimately, she dies.
This angers the mothers' even more, ultimately leading to a war against Canada, and the execution of Terrance and Phillip.
The visuals are excellent and on a par with the latest computer generated movies, the story is heart warming and touches on philosophical themes often related to more adult titles like Blade Runner or even Ghost in the Shell, the action is well handled and true to the cartoon origins of the title and ultimately there is enough depth and charm in this movie to satisfy both kids and adults.
Somerset tries to educate him, tries to warn him, but ultimately fails.
The film ultimately is a nicely constructed lesson for those of us out of the loop.
As the work of a Crimally insane genius continues, Mills grows more and more erratic, and Somerset simply has to remain, to guide his young partner through the case, which ultimately leads to one of the finest climax's in movie history.
The movie is ultimately about how a person maintains a sense of morality in such conditions.
After many tedious, labored, pointless scenes of the three on board quarreling, facing several trumped-up, ultimately boring seafaring adversities, and doing various routine chores like hosing dog poop off the deck, there is a last-minute, psycho-type killing on board that comes out of nowhere and explains nothing.
Yes he is shocking, and yes sometimes some of the comedy is derived from obscenity in the way that some of the comedy of many an otherwise "highbrow" movie is derived from the obscene, but ultimately Lenny's value was that he laughed at his (and our) faults and made it seem okay to join him.
The clear dilemma of the movie is that Bruce is crass, rude, selfish, often annoying, highly unlikable... and ultimately right.
Lenny is the story of the controversial comedian Lenny Bruce whose wild antics and crude humor lead to rise and ultimately his fall.
You realize that you are on the wrong track and you want to go back, you do everything in your power to gain your former self, but you ultimately fail.

It would be so much more powerful if he is ultimately beaten to incapacitation by his father, rather than being hit by a car.
Not just an astonishingly great (and, at the risk of coming off as clichÃ©, perfect) work of art, this is a moving, thought-provoking, and ultimately heartbreaking tale about the loss of innocence and the tragedies of war.
What we have with "Grave of the Fireflies," is a story of innocence lost and two children who ultimately face a losing battle with trying to survive in a small Japanese village in the closing days of World War II.
You find yourself hoping that things will go right now for Setsuko and Seita, and then the knowledge that ultimately it won't undercuts you with real emotional power.
Their dialog is funny and ultimately believable  Secondly, there is the storyline.
This element is of course present in the scenes between Carole and Maizie, the latter being as unpleasant and manipulative as the audience needs her to be in order that we do not need to worry about her (or Fred's treatment of her) when she is ultimately dispatched (landing on her feet in any event).
The main Russian villain is fairly eccentric, but ultimately just boils down to your typical such baddie for this type of fare, spurting out an annoying number of sentences that begin with 'in my country, we have a saying...'   But none of the cast can do much about a frenetic, convulted plot that leaves too little time to really care about any of the characters and also raises some serious plausibility errors through-out.

Okay, if you can look past the fact that the "comedy team" (a term used very loosely here)is just a rip off of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, and the fact that Lugosi is only here because he was taking any and every role he was offered at this point, it's actually almost funny on it's own, even though most of the time I laughed at the parts that weren't supposed to be funny, and groaned at the parts that were trying to be funny, but were ultimately just embarrassing.

Set (and beautifully observed) deep into the tour of one of those third tier "acting" companies (heavy on the melodramatic programming and light on competent management) that lived on "the road" and which helped bring about first the rise of powerful central booking agencies and ultimately the formation of Actors' Equity, the film seems to say these are a memory of the past even in 1926 .

The failure to do this ultimately spoiled a perfectly good premise for a film.

The Sacrifice (directed by Koji Shiraishi) is the title of the third story, and although lacking in scares, it is made watchable by the presence of the gorgeous YÃ» Yamada who stars as a young woman cursed by a creepy workmate, but who is ultimately saved by her mother (who sacrifices herself to a giant disembodied head with strange eyes!).
It fails - whether it is noble failure or pathetic failure is ultimately up to you - but the failure to intertwine themes and idea throughout the movie results in this mismatching.

This film - perhaps even more than the source material that it clearly owes its entire existence to - relies far too much on slick, but ultimately hollow and meaningless, cinematography.
That is this movie's gimmick, and ultimately, its failing.
That is the type of damaging effect such films as this one can truly have on you, and if you find yourself doing the same thing as I just described after watching even one of these films I implore you: please avoid "Traces of Death" like you would the plague because ultimately all it will ever do is give you horrible nightmares and leave you thoroughly nauseated for days after viewing!

which ultimately signify nothing.

However, given that he ultimately is SMARTER than LeBlanc isn't quite as hard to believe (at least in light of his role on "Friends").

George Sluizer's genius direction comes from the idea of playing with the audience's nerves, letting anxiety build as we learn what ultimately happened to Saskia.

Smacking of other successful, but just as stupid, unfunny, uninteresting and ultimately pointless garbage, as "The Osbournes", this show was also set-up as an all-access and occasionally would-be tongue-in-cheek insight into the day-to-day life of one Victoria Gotti, the younger of late notorious Mafia Don John Gotti's two daughters, who is apparently a plastic-surgery obsessed socialite/gossip columnist/author/newly divorced single-mother of three loud, spoiled, lazy, and profane teenage sons.

I would assume that this was an ultimately lame attempt for a scary movie, but jeez, does it fall flat!

Borat played the part of the idiot, but it was American culture which ultimately looked foolish.
While well-produced and full of (uncomfortable) novelty, the simultaneously laughable, queasy, and historically and culturally naÃ¯ve experiment to imagine a modern "history" of the Confederate States of America is a palpably unsubtle insult - not only to Southerners, to Black Americans, and to modern conservatives but, ultimately, to all Americans.

"Schoolgirls in Chains", with its grotesquely provocative yet inaccurate title, may perhaps thrive on a series of ultimately controversial, shocking and politically incorrect themes, but the low-budget elaboration and lack of talent involved (fortunately?)

An ambitious but ultimately unsatisfying western that is bound to irritate fans beyond measure, "Track of the Cat" (1954) is an uneasy mix of hunting-the-cat action and sub-Eugene O'Neill playwriting, complete with jarring comic relief and loquacious but indecisive moralizing.
It all has a certain well-measured charm, even if the whimsical wordplay gets overbearing quite often, and ultimately it loses this charm when it is decided that the character Marie is maintaining her dignity when refusing to read aloud pornographic material by de Sade for a geriatric judge and his friends, while finding no moral objection in allowing herself to be seduced by another client.

'She Hate Me' is raw and gritty in its imagery, remarkable in its musicality and at times sensual in its deliveryÂbut ultimately not a good movie.
What's ultimately disappointing about "She Hate Me" is the often-inane writing.
Having been cut from a longer print (which it shows) and adapted for TV, this looks every bit of a TV-movie it ultimately is, with unremarkable cinematography and choppy editing.

Some of the split screen stuff worked well too, but ultimately the plot went nowhere.
A hijacked airliner in itself makes for an interesting story, but the makers of this tat appear to have assumed that everyone watching was fully aware of the context and the ultimately fatal crashes of this plane and three others.
Unlike the Wonga movie, this has a little personality, and though it's ultimately stupid in every way, it has some charm.
I can't even be entertained anymore, because I am acutely aware of how shallow, empty, and ultimately pretentious it all is.
The link with September 11th 2001 is an intriguing idea, but it gets bogged down and ultimately lost in the poorly developed narrative.
So it lingers in that limbo of movies that is ultimately forgettable.
I like to think that co-writers Bill Couturie and Robert Greenfield had more in mind for this two-part miniseries than what ultimately resulted, especially given Couturie's involvement in the superb HBO movie "Dear America: Letters Home From Vietnam" which utilized little original music and no original footage, letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves.
What isn't welcome is how "The '60s" drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect (and this may well be the only time an American TV presentation about post-60s America never mentions the British Invasion - no Beatles, no Rolling Stones... then again, there's only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album, right?).
Even though his character is the most vile, evil, manipulative, and ultimately unlikeable person in the entire film, he still manages to give an awesome performance and show what acting is all about.
That is my favourite quote in showbiz,and is ultimately the movie's longest lasting legacy.

And, David Warner was absolutely convincing as the true-love-starved immortal, ultimately betrayed by his over-possessive housekeeper.
It does have a few good moments here and there, such as a close-up of the unseen killer peering through a vent, or secretly breaking into the cobweb ridden crawlspace, but these moment are ultimately swallowed up by the relentlessly tedious pace.
Cain's "reimagining" was just a one-dimensional creation, a square warmonger who -as always happens with writers who dislike the military- is ultimately proved wrong in almost everything she does.
Those who remained could be ultimately divided into two groups: the fanatics, for whom anything with the brand "Galactica" (excluding the old show) was God turned into television, and regular viewers who were giving the show the benefit of the doubt, hoping that things could be salvaged at the end with a plausible explanation.
He had the means, and ultimately proved his detractors right exactly about what they were trying to say from the beginning: that Moore, and Galactica, were all show and no substance, with soap-operish drama, weak actors -with a few exceptions in Olmos, McDonnell and a couple more-.
Yet the violence begets violence moral of films like this is as sanctimonious and shallow as it is obvious and ultimately meaningless.
To be honest, I felt JesÃºs Franco's "Sexual Story of O" is ultimately about sexual awakening and the dangers of embracing a sexually free lifestyle with just anyone..often is the case, there are repercussions if you have passionate relations with just anyone.
This movie needs to be filed under comedy for the unintentional hilarity that ensues on this whacky adventure all the way from the random beginning, over the mountain of plot less and disconnected exposition and then ultimately to the regret of even wasting your time on this.
Numerous people involved brought talent, experience, heart, energy and hope to the project, most without benefit of paycheck, but ultimately if a pilot flies a plane straight into a cliff, everyone still dies.

When his drunken shooting causes a cattle stampede with death (including his own) and destruction ensuing, his sister (Olivia) despises Hatton (Flynn) for firing the shot that ultimately killed her brother.
Incoherent, meaningless, historically inaccurate and ultimately completely pointless.
But, as Scott Peterson's firsthand account Me Against My Brother shows, the mission was doomed by intelligence failures, partisan deployments and, ultimately, the belief that you can bomb a nation into peace and prosperity.
"Inspector Gadget 2" has not seen the best reviews, nor will it get a good one from me Â it tried, but ultimately it failed.
While I will admit that the plot held my interest for a while, it was largely due to the poorly handled time travel logistics (which are ultimately explained/explained away).
Some noble people try to expose this and ultimately stop them.
Griffith strikes out as a police woman who goes undercover in New York's Hissidic Jewish community to solve the disappearance of a young jewelry shop keeper whom she ultimately discovers murdered..From one of the opening scenes when Griffith asserts her character as a tough talking, trigger happy cowboy, or girl in this instance, we know the plot is headed for ridicule.
Visual effects and the strange time traveling are all it has to offer..   "the I inside" tries hard to be intelligent and mysterious but is ultimately uninteresting but of course you don't find that out until the end of the movie...where you are left scratching your head and disappointed.
The Freelings' powerful bond of love will ultimately determine their outcome against Kane, The Beast.
Overall, there's good stuff in this sequel but it's ultimately squandered on a rubbish ending.
The fact that the film methodically ignores the contributions of the far more influential and widely celebrated 19th century investigator of industrial depressions and poverty, Karl Marx, is but one indication of this film's intellectually shoddy and ultimately dishonest character.
The problem is, he doesn't remember a thing-- and suddenly the police are in his $9.00-per-night flop house room asking questions...  A story told in cryptic terms can be a challenge to an audience, and unraveling a mystery can be an engrossing and ultimately satisfying experience.
As far as performances go, Campbell Scott is solid as always, but his efforts here, while commendable, are ultimately an exercise in futility.
This film had some potential to begin with, but ultimately I wouldn't waste your time with this one.

He plays a prankster, who has knack of turning every thing into funny and the one who doesn't believe in the institution of love, but ultimately falls for it.
The lone gunmen I could have handled, as Mulder's absence from their funeral was crass and very unheroic - but after Krycek & X, this felt contrived - pandering to the audience, and ultimately not respecting their intelligence.
Tommy takes in Trumpy and teaches him the joys of jigsaw puzzles and eating peanuts (which Trumpy sucks through his snout, which should be charming but is ultimately a creepy image).
Characters were never introduced, had no depth and ultimately left you cold.
Various other elements are brought into play, such as a society scandal, some incriminating photographs, a good cop, a corrupt cop, and an extremely powerful and wealthy society lady (who turns out to be behind the plot, her intention being to frame and ultimately kill Tom so that his paintings, many of which she owns, will rise in value).
When he returns to the apartment, he finds Lisa dead (he actually trips over and lands face first in her pubic hair), so he ultimately decides he has to go on the run.
This movie could have informed the audience about these relationships, about the growth of both people involved, their character development, and there could have even been subplots of action or care or intrigue without involving a contrived, convoluted, and ultimately damaging subplot involving human trafficking, a horrific and reprehensible practice that has nothing to do with 99.9% of the BDSM community.
Yet amazingly this is done in a manner that is surprisingly un-sleazy, which is about the only thing I would fault the movie for: It's not sleazy enough, and ultimately too stupid to actually take seriously.
Opening: Sinister scene showing ultimate evil-doers planning their ultimately evil things.
Following the cringeworthy opening scene with young Hellboy (surely just an excuse to get John Hurt in the film) i was hoping the film would pick up with the introduction to our villain, yet the almost immediate revelation of his fatal weakness ensured that we already knew how he would ultimately be defeated.
Besides, it establishes situations - for instance, Lugosi's long-time grudge with George Zucco - that are ultimately left hanging in the air and which it never bothers to resolve or adequately explain, that one's attention is bound to wander throughout.
Law and order ultimately sets things straight but not before a guilt ridden member of the dealers haunted by flashbacks jumps through a ten story window to her death.
The main aspect of these types of films that ultimately make or breaks them is the partnership, here it's a quick talking wise cracking Philadelphia cop with a blatant disregard for police procedure who gets teamed up with a quiet respectful native American Indian & it just doesn't come off since there's virtually no humour or memorable interplay between the two.
The characters are very animated, but are, ultimately, very flat and uninteresting.
But ultimately, the film is unsatisfying for all of the reasons listed above.

Yet, the low-budget ultimately ruins the movie.
The Cons Thumbsucker takes too long to get its point across, which for me ultimately was not much of a point at all.
Moderately interesting but maddeningly slow and ultimately sleep-inducing thriller, set in the desolate highways of rural France.
It never finds a focus, (ultimately, I cared very little about any of the characters), it has the always fateful flaw of dialog that gets lost in whispered tones or buried beneath the score or SFX, and finally ... WHY, in heaven's name is Anthony Hopkins using his not-so-convincing American accent to play a character that could have been played better by half-a-dozen American actors?
Whether that's a good or bad thing will ultimately be up to the viewer, but there is a good chance for big disappointment.

The film reflects the anarchic dissonance and harsh violence of the newfangled "spaghetti" Westerns then pouring out of Europe, but ultimately its sensibility and construction belong to television.
Filthy tries desperately to shock and scare but ultimately just fails.
The whole sequence in which Christopher Reeve turns psycho and ultimately splits into two personas, having a big fight with himself, is the only reason the movie is worth seeing, and most people fail to acknowledge that Reeve actually did some truly good acting here, good enough so that the "bad Superman" is convincing and somewhat scary -- especially the scene where he is sitting in a bar, unkempt and unshaven, breaking holes in a mirror behind the bar while flicking peanuts at it (never mind that alcohol is not supposed to have any effect on Superman).
The concept of Superman fighting his evil twin is a nice idea, but ultimately falls flat on its a**.
Director Richard Lester tries his best to make the movie work, but ultimately, it doesn't, thanks in part to the absence of Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor and the near-absence of Margot Kidder as Lois Lane (Kidder has a total of about three minutes on-screen).
Emily Blunt's character is snooty but ultimately likable, and Stanley Tucci plays the kind of "gal pal" every girl wishes she had.
Some of them HAVE been great but others like "Wild Strawberries" and this are just meandering, depressing and ultimately pointless.
Overrated, depressing and ultimately pointless.
The sequel, 1983s 'Boogey Man II' is ultimately a waste of time, but at the very least it's an entertaining one if not taken the least bit seriously.
While this movie may somewhat accurately depict callous British imperialism towards native populations, and is sympathetic to the trod-upon Maori, "Utu" (Sumerian for sun, but for the Maori it means revenge) ultimately fails as a story and film because so few of the more prominent foundations that the film lays at the beginning are actually paid off at the end.
As we've seen in other films about the long arm of British imperialism, a soldier's military training ultimately wins out in the end.
The soldiers are thus shown as ultimately superior intellects in warfare, and while they may have been, Te Wheke was taken so easily, almost casually so, after months of successful evasion.
If so, it's too easy and ultimately unbelievable.
I could have used less talk and more music, since this is what the documentary is ultimately about; well beside their lives and the creative process.
So it's a curios at best, but with out-there and ultimately accurate ideas about media and pop culture, the kind of thing film buffs can appreciate.
The shot of the subject wandering aimlessly through the mountains in hopelessness defines this movie...and is ultimately passed off to the viewer after watching - hopeless to get time or money back.
Because thereon after, every agonisingly cheesy clichÃ© from teen slasher movies right through to low budget horror farce is played out here and it is ultimately the fault of the banal script and utterly horrendous direction.
and feel ultimately disappointed.
The biggest problem of "Amore" is the script, working moderately, occasionally even quite well for about an hour, after which the story is rapidly mutating from a pretty tight, at intervals hard-hitting crime flick into an extraordinarily boring wife-murder yawn ultimately dissolving into lukewarm air, the end being one of the most awful letdowns in Italian thriller history.
Then there's loads of dialogue, more action, but ultimately, it's Arnie's acting who makes me give this film a 2 out of 10.
There is no answer to that question, and that's what makes this film ultimately excruciating.
Unlike "Night of the Living Dead" or its sequels, the plague of zombies is attributed here to a flu-like virus, an obvious homage to the half-baked but ultimately superior Danny Boyle movie "28 Days Later."
Few of these works seems to have had the guts to break away from the "rules" laid out by the "...of the Dead" films, ultimately to the artistic detriment of each.
It's rather like being trapped watching the home movies of a group of very artsy, very neurotic, very self centered, and ultimately very boring people.
it had all the ingredients, but is ultimately ruined by two thousand times overused clichÃ©s which seem to have become fashionable again nowadays (see, for instance 'Brokeback Mountain' or the French 'Le clan'):the first one: the old homosexual teacher, OF COURSE, had to die at the end (the fact that is is a motorcycle accident and not a bashing doesn't matter, finally...); the fact that everyone mourns him at the end does not matter, the moral is safe, he finally 'paid for his sins'.
Darkly comic tale, brightly-produced yet full of cynicism, has brief moments that go out on a limb, but is ultimately a rather formulaic "Heathers" knock-off.
Because ultimately given the overall geostrategy of the region, with whats going on in Afghanistan, you are not helping India and the people of South Asia with such cheap movies.
It's real problem, though, is that ultimately it's a polite, clean and determinedly inoffensive film about a dirty, ugly war.

Character development is limited, and, even where attempted, ultimately uninvolving.
Like most young women who make the same mistake at this age, Panabaker looks to her mother (played by a loving but intense Mercedes Ruhl) for advice and in response she promptly pulls her out of school, picks up and moves as quickly as possible to another town where no one will know who they are, warns Panabaker to never contact the child's father and tell him about the situation and ultimately decides that instead of having to explain her grandchild's origins and the whole messy problem itself to a new set of people she just pretends the infant is hers...one of those late-in-life babies born to a middle-aged woman shortly before her divorce through what seems like some sort-of miracle and without the hassle of the whole in-vitro process.
However, even with those somewhat high marks added to it, "Mom At Sixteen" still fails in it's attempts at coming across as realistically as possible due greatly to the facts that the characters are not as well-written nor nearly as fully-developed as they should have been, and even the story itself takes too many twists right smack in the middle of it which ultimately causes the remainder of the film to fall apart towards the extremely unsatisfactory and sadly contrived ending.
That was easily the finest stream of horse garbage I have ever typed...  "This film is the ultimately worst film of all time.
I ultimately decided to give this film a chance despite its awful critical reviews based upon my experience that low-brow comedies are often brutally panned when in fact they achieve precisely what they set out to achieve by providing low-brow laughs.
Nothing seems to happen in this overly long film, which ultimately disappoints.
Perplexing and ultimately unsettling, "Crazy Like a Fox" argues that law, order and a free market are not valued in Virginia and that rich, snobby people are mean and should be kicked out of small towns.
The plot manages to be both epic (nations collide) and small (boy grows up) at the same time, but it is ultimately the smallness that you are left with : the story simply never takes off.
His wife is forced to move back with her parents and Spencer is ultimately asked to leave--much to the delight of her parents!
The film ultimately is about watching Bradley and company mowing down men dressed up because real ninja would have finished them off rather quickly.
Michael Dudikoff is a poor actor, but when compared to David Bradley he almost seems like the next Laurence Olivier, Steve James returns but ultimately this sequel is far too awful to dig up any entertainment value in this garbage.
There is plenty of charm in LONG LIFE, HAPPINESS AND PROSPERITY, enough that I found myself wanting to like it more than I ultimately did.
I stuck around for Nick Stahl's storyline, which was interesting but ultimately frustrating.
This is one of those films that looks kind of important but ultimately feels like lazy film-making.
Concluding with an ironic albeit extremely telegraphed ending, "Mantis in Lace" is ultimately a real mixed bag; a psychedelic psycho curiosity that should have been better.
Though I believe it could have been magical, and it did begin well, to my disappointment, the journey and end were ultimately rather ridiculous and pretentious.  
Though it is intimated by Lancaster and ultimately diluted by the film's message of RAMPANT CORN-GROWING, it is never made clear that the Apache peoples were always fighting for the two causes which Amerikans hold most dear as their god-given rights - their homeland and their freedom.
JUBILEE was the first film to come from the true British punk rock scene, and has a fascinating cast, but unfortunately this is one of the most boring, pretentious, and ultimately pointless movies I've ever seen.
Instead, it is another "for dumb teens only" horror picture that lacks any real scares, is laden with awful clichÃ©s and ultimately fails because it bares the name and thus, seemingly tries to live up to the standards set by the infinitely better "original".
This film, one of the more notorious titles on Great Britain's 'Video Nasties' list, is nihilistic, grisly, and darkly funny...but also shallow and ultimately unsatisfying.
The mix of exploitation and art-house on a low budget is certainly interesting but ultimately a bit aimless.
Even the script was fine, including comedy, romance and adventure....which ultimately must have been the reason for Noah to accept the part; Genius Indiana Jones seeks stolen Biblical Relic from evil predecessor to save world.
Likewise, that the nerdy nebbish (Woody Allen without the fixation on the adopted children of his mate) gay guy -- who, unfortunately for him, was ten years ahead of the gay geek hotness era we find ourselves in -- and in any event, hot gay geeks are not Broadway musical fans much less piano players, would be in love (in classic Hollywood romantic comedies from the 40s and 50s fashion) with the gay hunk best pal and, ultimately, the hunk would (for no reason at all, without any real basis, after turning him down because the neb was clearly not the hunk's type, and after lusting in love with a guy who's only real thing in common with the neb is that they both have a musical background?
With all of that said, ultimately it is a fun movie if you don't care about verisimilitude and as I said, most people would see it as fun for the whole family.
MCP types unable to control their libidos, and therefore chasing the skirts outside their marriage, and who ultimately are set right as per the norms of the happily married ones by one Mr. Lucky Bhaiyya.
", but ultimately I would not care enough about them.
But it was the film that was ultimately abused (and I'm using a nice word) by Band.
Apparently the house, as they soon find out, was built by some well-known architect in the mid-nineteenth century ultimately making it very valuable and highly sought-after by a number of collectors.

This screenplay is actually incompetent and there is ultimately nothing Arnold can do to salvage it.
Every character in this movie makes the most boneheaded decisions that ultimately leads to his or her own death.
Some of the killings are appropriately nasty but the film ultimately is an unbelievable bore.
And we sense, despite what the fade out seems to be trying to imply, that the metronome will continue to tick on at the same rate until everyone ultimately dies.
TOUR was trying too hard to be a hundred and one different things at once, and ultimately buckled under its own indecision.
The murder mystery is interesting enough, and there is a refreshingly un-melodramatic approach to the proceedings (fairly unusual for something shown on Lifetime), but ultimately the story doesn't wash.
Sure, there are some great effects, but ultimately, there is nothing too spectacular on display here.
It is not clear where the fault for this silly and ultimately unneeded film lies.
They are portrayed as cro-magnonesque, flying 2 Raptors in to fire on the GORT which ultimately fails, leaving someone whom we are assumed to be in command saying to an airplane hangar full of troops "Anybody else got any ideas?"
Arkin's good intentions are more than admirable, but ultimately leads to a tragic conclusion that will rip your heart out.
But once the Federal Reserve drops the interest rates down to unprecedentedly low levels, the risk changes and even those people who may not be ultimately able to pay beck their debt, can become profitable.
A better idea might be to prevent the Federal Reserve from tampering with interest rates so that we don't continue to encourage an ultimately unsustainable spend-now-pay-later economy in the mistaken belief that somehow the economy is driven by consumer spending.
It does highlight two college students that ultimately committed suicide because they applied for and received credit cards upon starting college, unknown to their parents.
They were irresponsible, ran up a debt they couldn't escape and ultimately turned to suicide.
Certainly innovative for that time, but ultimately disappointing, in my opinion.
My oh my, Oswaldo de Oliveira must have had the time of his life whilst filming this ultimately depraved and sleaze-laden Women In Prison classic.
'Golf' had a lot of potential, but it ultimately takes a mulligan.
And Lesley Ann Warren, as a somber waitress forever confined in small-town despair, hints at a potentially affecting performance if the script ultimately didn't eventually turn her character into a nondescript plot device.
The angels never get a good fight going, there never seems to be any actual battle for the soul which is supposed to be ultimately important.
This potted history of the infamous Australian outlaw benefits tremendously from Gerry Fisher's frequently ravishing photography but is ultimately doomed by its paint by numbers screenplay and the star turn by Mick Jagger (who reportedly dismissed the film as a "load of s**t").
There is no passion whatsoever, from the director or the actors, which ultimately leads to a dull film.
In the end I felt ultimately cheated and I think anyone who expects even the most basic elements of filmmaking skill will do to.
Or should he actually be a genuinely affected individual, who is slowly seeing the dramatic consequences of his every action, and is ultimately being destroyed by it?
Writer / director / songwriter / co-star Bruce Kimmel (who had previously worked with co-star Cindy Williams in 1976's "The First Nudie Musical") gives it just a little bit of curiosity value with a few musical numbers (his songs actually ARE kind of catchy), but the film is ultimately lacking in real wit and basically has no energy.
That's not to say there are no positive qualities to the film, but it is far more burdened with flaws, and it's more likely to ultimately annoy rather than entertain.
Ben Kingsley was also good as the planetary leader who ultimately becomes the villain.
Woody's stories are often derivative, but he's forgiven that, usually, because the results are good and ultimately do deserve his signature.
As directed by James Ivory and produced by Ismail Merchant--who would become long-time partners and filmmakers--"The Guru" isn't bad; the locations are great and there are intermittent bits of satire that are certainly fashionable (for 1969, especially), yet ultimately there is too much ambiance and not enough plot.

"Karaula" is a cinematic equivalent of those 1980s hammy pop-folk-rock-whatever-happens-to-be-selling-at-the-moment-that is-what-we-play Bijelo dugme clones (Merlin, Hari Mata Hari, Valentino, Plavi orkestar, Divlje jagode, Regina) - a populist, don't-you-dare-go-deeper-than-the-outer-layer, watchable but ultimately quickly forgettable experience.
The retro-chic world of the original TV series is nicely recreated and there's no shortage of nice cars, costumes and locations but what's good about the film is easily drowned out by what's bad; The Avengers is ultimately a shallow, rushed and messy affair, severely hampered by the performances of its two leads.
In the movie he never seems fascinated, but ultimately annoyed -- he seemed patronizing and dismissive from the very first.
Why does Tucci's character ultimately stop writing?
It is partially effective, but it ultimately becomes basically yet another one of them thar soap opries, replete with hokey dialogue.
It's purportedly about the non-adventures of this bratty little rich girl (Neve Campbell) and her no-account boyfriend (Fred Weller) and, ultimately, their scheme to seduce a rich Italian count (Dominic Chianese) out of some major money.
There, she meets her dream man, helps Dominique overcome an embarrassing secret and ultimately all ends well.
"Shiryo No Wana 2: Hideki" is a vile and repulsive movie which tries in vain to emulate the success of the first "Evil Dead Trap" but ultimately ends up as a vastly inferior sequel(in name only).
There are a few interesting ideas on time travel that are bandied about, but they ultimately go nowhere, and the military scenes at the beginning seem to serve no purpose for the rest of the movie.
However, as Leonard Maltin said it so beautifully, this film ultimately reminds one too much of the easy listening jazz that plays under nearly every scene.
Bottom line, the above depiction stems from a childish conception that by default associates World War One German aviation with countless formations of red-coated Triplanes, as if the Germans had somehow managed to perpetuate endless clones of Von Richtofen, to say nothing about the fact that the Fokker Dr. 1 was ultimately produced in insignificant numbers, culminating in an actual production run of only 160 examples.
Story - non-existent Characters - generic and stiff Dialogue - embarrassing SFX - way wayyyy too much (unconvincing) CGI  I wanted to just stop the flick early and end my pain, but ultimately I was drawn to know what on earth Crispin Glover saw in this project.
The lasting message that I got from the movie was that, ultimately, sex without love is an empty thing, but love without sex is a wonderful thing.
When all four lead unite in the Las Vegas hotel room, a sequence begins that exudes hilarity, sexuality, uncomfortability, and ultimately, a bittersweet melancolia topped by a Fellini-esque finale.
-- but ultimately the message of the film has nothing to do with the sometimes ridiculous ambitions of its struggling protagonists but more with the importance of pursuing a dream, come what may.
Watching Jeremy squirm and ultimately become frightened out of his wits was a ton of fun.The ending is a bit silly(..and rather logically unsound), pointing out another schemer out for a payday, but overall I think it's fun, if derivative somewhat.
A very clever and ultimately quite emotional film from a fascinating period in American Cop-dom: 1953...as LA CONFIDENTIAL proved for that city.
Their begin to psychological torment their father and ultimately drive him to desire leaving his family.
McMurray is a toy manufacturer and Sirk gets lots of mileage out of the metaphor; McMurray toys with the idea of leaving wife and family, as does the 'other woman', Norma Vale (Barbara Stanwyck), who turns up out of the blue and past respectively just when McMurray is at his most vulnerable yet ultimately Norma merely toys with his feelings.
Dismissed as another episode, Mulder and Scully ultimately return to D.C with nothing when Billy is taken by the Bounty Hunter, who had finally convinced him that he was who he said he was.

The acting was adequate, but ultimately couldn't overcome the problem for me with the characters in general.
But ultimately, it failed to deliver.
There are two power-players in this film that each bring something unique and original to the screen and ultimately make Ma femmeÂs'appelle Maurice worth watching..

Unfortunately, the 3D glasses added significant physical discomfort to an ultimately boring final hour of the movie.

The filtered lens only maximizes the almost enchanted beauty that pours through from the screen and onto the viewers' eyes; indeed, this is nostalgia for a time gone by, a trip down memory lane and a subtle incursion into a denouncement of the horrors of war which never rears its ugly head but whose presence ultimately swallows a family, whole.
Gould, I suppose, can be an engaging actor, but is way out of his league; this film is, ultimately, only for completists.

"); Arnie's dead rabbit and live frog; the constantly shifting implications of guilt in the death of "Harry" up there on the hill; the characters' struggles to regain innocence by "doing the right thing"; the closet door that swings open for no apparent reason (never explained); the characters' revelations of the truths about themselves; their wishes granted through Sam's "negotiations" with the millionaire art collector from the "city" -- ALL portrayed within the conservative but ultimately flexible confines of their New England repression and stoicism (yes, the film is also a satiric comment on '50s morality) -- these details and more finally yield a rich tapestry of our common humanity, observed at a particular time and place, through specific people caught in an absurd yet utterly plausible circumstance.

Your choice, and ultimately, your loss.

Not that it has not its interesting points, like a vulnerable Dracula becoming human again and trying to recover his vampiric condition, but everything is so underdeveloped that it's ultimately worthless.
Most of the movies coming out over the next few months are simply product, attractive, eye catching, and ultimately little more than 90 minute advertisements for the sequel.
With absolutely no spoken dialogue between our two main characters and a series of bizarre incidents (see the way the old man and his girl read fortunes), I was left out to sea to piece "The Bow's" puzzle together on my own, no one or nothing to help guide me wrap my head around this mysterious couple, experiencing ever-changing and intense feelings of anger, disgust, wonder, and, ultimately, sadness.

The late, great Eloy de la Iglesia's taut, austere, fiercely humorless and deliberate direction, ably assisted by Raul Artigot's grainy, gloriously unadorned no-frills cinematography, Fernando G. Morcillo's spare, spooky, nerve-jangling score, occasional outbursts of hideously graphic and genuinely shocking violence, gradual pacing, an unsparingly solemn tone, and properly subdued naturalistic acting from the uniformly solid cast, creates a frightfully squirmy and sweaty suffocating gloom-doom atmosphere which ultimately delivers one hell of a potent and lingering kick-you-in-the-gut wallop.
