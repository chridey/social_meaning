Cowboy movie actor, Cameron Mitchell, turns in an equally strong performance as piano player, Johnny Alderman, who leaves Etting, out of disgust for the way she is being dominated, only to encounter her years later, when the two of them are working on a movie.
There were times when she lost character and broke into her "girl next door" personality but those mistakes were few, however, and I'm sure when Miss Day sees the film today, she could kick herself.
!Saw this when I was @ 9yrs old, and never forgot...the sets the costumes, and Doris Day... what an underraed talent... with all her wonderful films, has only been Oscar nominated once, acted beautifully and sang her heart out!
MY RATING- 7.3  This one is a curious mov made when James Cagney had already left his crime movs.
I have to say when a name like Zombiegeddon and an atom bomb on the front cover I was expecting a flat out chop-socky fung-ku, but what I got instead was a comedy.
And when I say bad, I mean The Shield Vic Macky bad.
But unlike that show I was laughing when they shot people and smoked dope.
I mean, some of it didn't make sense with the rest of the flick, but who cares when you're laughing so hard!
It's nice when something surprises you but not totally sucking.
There's a great moment shortly after the characters arrive in LA and he's been throwing his weight around, when she punctures him mid-boast.
There's another wonderful scene, towards the end, when Robert Keith's Loomis checks Snyder's fury and tells him to, essentially, get over his own fragile ego.
James Cagney is always a delight to watch, even when he's playing a pompous and disgusting pig like Marty Snyder.
With her tremendous voice, and the acting skills she demonstrated in this role, one can only imagine what she would have done had she been one of the MGM stars, when their musicals were known as the best.
Acting as her mentor and personal manager, Snyder gets it almost right when he states "Why just have half of Chicago when she can have all of New York", as he lands Etting a gig with the Ziegfield Follies.
I think the film was right to depict him with almost no redeeming features up until, I suppose, the obligatory happy ending - you feel he doesn't deserve the good turn that Day / Etting pays him when his new club opens.
All of this is just filler, until the cuter woman goes in the shower, disappears when a hand grabs her, and some juice is tossed at the shower wall.
We learn this when a guy who hates late fees kills the clerk by cheaply ripping his heart out, and eating it when charged.
Born in 1896, Etting was a hardknocks chorus girl when she caught the eye of small-time Chicago hood Martin "Moe the Gimp" Snyder, who married her in 1922 and proceeded to promote her career--occasionally, according to rumor, at gun point.
By 1927 Etting was a popular singer and a major Broadway star, and when talkies arrived the couple moved to California, where Etting became a favorite for the musical shorts that were then in vogue.
But the marriage was volatile, and when Snyder found Etting was having an affair with pianist Myrl Alderman, Snyder shot him.
Her performance in LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME is often considered her high-water mark as a dramatic actress: she gives it everything she's got, and the sparks really fly when she and Cagney square off.
Doris Day's portrayed Ruth as a sexy and sassy performer and sung with a strong, jazzy, bluesy voice, when I saw the real Ruth perform in the movies and in 2 shorts, she wasn't sexy and sassy, she was reserved, the type of performer to stand still and sing with great emotion and feeling, she wasn't the wiggling hips type like Doris Day portrayed and Ruth's voice was so light, airy, powerful without being loud and aggressive, you don't hear the blues, jazz in Ruth's voice yet she was a torch singer.
Not being a great Cagney fan, I didn't have high hopes for this film when I first saw it.
But when she takes the spotlight, singing `Mean to Me' or `Ten Cents A Dance' (with her feet planted provocatively Â defiantly Â apart), Day, actress and character, takes it by natural right.
Finally, when there's about a half hour left everything begins to build up again and the momentum keeps building at you're awaiting a "Bang!"
ending, when, ironically, the ending turns out to be anti-climatic.
One of my favourites is when Bruce Willis and Goldie Hawn plan  to murder Meryl Streep (who plays Willis' wife).
One feels almost ashamed when watching her.
But as it progressed, I was laughing so hard on certain scenes like when Dr. Menville is reporting the murder of Madelyn and she suddenly gets up and starts walking toward him.
2) The police were a little funny when they were framing someone.
I was wired up when the movie started from winning a close softball game 15-14, but this movie put me to near sleep within 10 minutes.
What do you get when you put the 2 greatest actresses alive today (Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn) together with the incomparable Bruce Willis and thrown in a little Isabella Roselini for good measure...you get a hilariously funny comedy that had to have been just as much fun to make as it was to watch!
>From the scene when Madeline falls down and breaks her neck to the ending where they both fly apart, it just does not get any better.
This movie goes to prove that beauty is more than skin deep when it comes to the celebrities.
I saw this film when i was about 9, since then i have been hooked on it!
Helen's life falls apart when glamorous Madeline steals Helen's fiancÃ©, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville, and marries him.
- but when she sees that Helen is now a svelte redhead, she balks - and their reunion is one of dripping, beautiful venom, the highlight of the entire movie.
How do you feel when someone comes to you and say "You are old!".
That was one of the phrases when a young man complains to Meryl Streep.
I never saw "Death Becomes Her" when it first come out because of a review I had read somewhere.
I remember the bad review criticized the writers for setting the story in a rainy, stormy Los Angeles when California was going through a drought.
Zombiegeddon is a bad movie: very boring, no story, no, absolutely no action and a real waste of a few good B-movie-legends: Scream-Queen Brinke Stevens, she was about 50 when she made this one - real beauty never fades -, has a few good moments, Tom Savini, the legendary Sex-Machine in Tarantino/Rodriguez "From Dusk Till Dawn", is wasted here, too.
The movie hits the highest moments when, for instance, Meryl asks Isabella Rossellini how much the magic potion costs and Isabella replays: "Oh the sordid topic of coin" sublime, exquisite, funny but with enormous regard for its audience.
But when Bruce calls Goldie Hawn to explain the "incident" at home he goes through a TV style monologue that seems to belong to a sit-com and not to the elegant vulgarity of this three sad, magnificent wannabees.
See, when threatening to arrest him, Kravaal concocted a solution which could poison them if the liquid were to erupt into gaseous form, when breathed could cause harm.
The house, however, conceals many hiding places and they discover a dilapidated laboratory and Judith shrieks when they stumble upon a skeleton.
And, when he later kills, you really understand with and could possibly condone why he did this.
Medieval: Total War II is also very good and I will like to play Empire: Total War when it comes out.
Only the roman emperors could, because of their vast wealth and power, slightly influence economics, but even when they applied drastic policies these would general fail or backfire.
Another strange thing is that when you are roman, the senate will give you quests that half the time simply undo-able(conquer a city in the middle of enemy territory within 10 turns, even if the trip will take 10 turns).
Each nation is well represented with their own troop types which allows for much replay-ability and sheer enjoyment when watched on the battlefield.
Since I was nearly 30 years old when this toy line was introduced, I didn't expect to really understand the charactors, and the plotline.
I was almost 10 when this movie came out and frankly I didn't really see what all of the fuss was about.
Even Leader one was awful when he didn't want to save Cy- kill, the nut.
I liked it when I first saw it in '79 and I like it more now.
My video copy is coming apart - so when is this thing coming on on DVD already?
I enjoyed this movie very much when I was a little girl, it was so erotic I din'd want the vampire to be killed at all...
Marshall as an old cop playing Van Helsing, teaming up in search of a vampire uprooted when a construction crew unwittingly release him.
However, it turned out to be quite a mess: not so surprising when considering that the only other J.L.
Most thrillers will spend the first hour developing the characters, involving you in their story so when they are in danger you are frightened for them.
It feels rushed, and when we do meet the killer, we feel short changed.
when u'll think u finally getting it.. even at the end... you'll than see once again that you wrong and this movie is even brilliant than you thought it is.. that this movie is one of the best movies i've ever saw.. i liked snatch and lsn2sb a lot!
But viewer be warned, when you think you know it all, you'll be in for a real surprise.
This film is really just something to watch when you are bored.
Sadly, the end is a little bit disappointing but when you watch this endlessly twisting conspiracy story you'll soon come to realise that it is just too clever for its own good.
Rachel (Lorreta Young) lives in the shadow of Big Davy's (William Holden)first wife when she is 'bought' to keep house and educate the young son.
the Both central male figures are worth close analysis- Mitchum claims to love and appreciate Rachel more than Holden's character, yet he too only thinks of Rachel in monetary terms when he offers to 'buy' Rachel from Holden.
Pictures like this one were made in the Hollywood of the post-war when all the men were back and happier times seemed just on the horizon.
"Rachel and the Stranger" is a good way to spend an evening when there is nothing else to do.
But things quickly change when Jim stops by on his way to town.
Black Robe took second place when I first saw it, 2 nights ago.
this film also showed how both sides thought the other was stupid, the Native's believed the Jesuits God was the clock and didn't understand the whole concept or for instance when the Black robe was lost and the Native's were directing him- they didn't understand how or why these foreign people didn't know anything about working with the land.
Awe and danger linger over nearly every scene, as the priest (Lothaire Bluteau) and his young European assistant (Aden Young) are accompanied by an increasingly disillusioned band of Huron Indians led by Chomina (August Schellenberg) whose daughter (Sandrine Holt) takes an interest in Daniel (Young) and in the process arouses strong sexual feelings in the celibate Father Laforgue(Bluteau) when he discovers them one evening making love.
It is very much how one feels when one can understand two mutually exclusive belief systems.
A California gold rush mining town advances toward 'civilization' when a whore house and a church arrive at the same time.
I felt invigorated and depressed when I saw it on the screen and again on TV.
As a portrait of life in New France (now Eastern Canada) in the early to mid-1600s--when Samuel de Champlain was the leader of the tiny French outpost of Quebec--this film is virtually flawless.
I saw this movie when it first came out and I loved it.
The first time I saw this film was about 15 years ago when it was first released.
This can be understood when one looks at some attitudes to what people feel when they get out of a situation they cannot stand.
Its realism earns it a ten out of ten for the most part, but there are times when it either goes too far, or lets its ambition exceed its ability enough, to deduct two points.
While the violence depicted in the film is no doubt accurate, what the film does not reveal is that the Iroquois likely became decidedly more hostile when the French began to assist old enemies, such as the Algonquin, in traveling into hunting grounds that had previously been Iroquois territory.
The piece of the show that always sticks in my mind is the ending, despite all of their schemes and plots the day comes when they have to go "over the top" and the final scene sees them running slow motion to certain death, not what yo would expect from a lesser comedy.
As such there was some controversy when it was first broadcast by the BBC for its apparent lack of respect to those who fought and lost their lives for the sake of freedom & democracy.
There are a few times when you discover an actor who just gets the characters right.
(Duvall's shirt is held shut with a safety pin, a tiny detail that my grandmother noticed immediately as the way men used to do it when the button fell off - she saw it hundreds of times as a girl in the 20's.)
I must admit though I didn't get any chocks but I didn't get that either when I saw the Exorcist so don't be surprised if you get scared!
Laura used to live at this orphanage and when she grows up, she starts to prepare it for some disadvantaged children.
No one knows what happened to Simon but when the truth is revealed, it comes as somewhat of a tragedy.
I usually regard a horror film as successful when a certain feeling or scene stays with me for a day after seeing it, if it can indent the terror, maybe even play with your mind after viewing it, the film has done its job.
There is nothing more important to her than her son and she displays this so convincingly that when the end of the film hits, the affect of the conclusion resonates that much more because you feel the emotions that Laura feels.
And when Simon goes missing one afternoon, she's convinced that they have taken him hostage.
By the end, when the truth is revealed, it's satisfying but it has been done before in other films.
Besides, wasn't it Alfred Hitchcock who said that it isn't the bomb under the table that makes the scene scary, it's the fact that you don't know when it's going to blow up that creates the tension.
It is similar in theme in that it is pretty creepy and scary until the end when you have some resolution for the protagonist, but not a typically happy American ending--a bittersweet ending, much like "The Orphanage".
I'm not a hardcore horror movies fan, but I still enjoy watching one or two when there's something interesting to watch.
Even when the grotesque rears its head, it is to enhance the story, not to shock for shock alone.
In fact, I'm known as El Pollo (The Chicken) when it comes to movies.
There is some of that, but mostly it's used as exposition -- it's when you're not really expecting anything that the director pushes the bejabbers button, leaving the audience chuckling -- like, "whoo -- THAT was a GOOD one!"
The story is a creepy one, and there is always an added air of unease when children are the focal point of the piece in question, and sure enough this central concept of troubled children and troubled childhoods gets the maximum amount of emotion from the viewing public.
This film achieved what others did not- I could not release my girlfriend's hand all over the time, and when the story finished I discovered there was nothing unexplained.
Bayona belongs to this new wave of Spanish-language directors (most notably Del Torro and Amenabar) who excel when it comes to creating moody atmospheric tales of the supernatural with Catholic overtones.
One must have a cold heart not to find sympathy with her, and even the most hardened audience member will find it hard not to feel that stray tear form in the corner of their trembling eye when all is revealed.
There is a sense of restraint when it comes to the scares in The Orphanage that many veteran filmmakers have failed to approach.
Bayona lets the frights build subconsciously, making each one far more effective when unleashed.
In fact, few cinematic moments rival The Orphanage for sheer terror as when Laura turns to a group of ghost hunters to help solve their specter problem.
Although most of the actual frights are on the soft side, the film does have quite away with sudden shocks, especially one great sequence involving the death of a sinister secondary character...you'll know when you see it!
But mostly, things stay pretty calm, and there were times when I was wishing for something more visceral to actually happen, as many of the very well built tension sequences fade away without any cinematic pay-off, such as a very tense sÃ©ance sequence, and in most of the (many) scenes of Laura alone in the orphanage, she being almost too subtly menaced for things to get really scary, which I think is a shame.
However there are certain moments when you WILL jump!
Like ALUCARDA, the film doesn't dwell on period reconstruction (and, in fact, we only realize when the story actually takes place via a reference towards the end to the Inquisition); still, a few social/racial issues are raised nonetheless with the presence of the two black nuns/maids, who are mistreated even by their white 'colleagues'!
Why is the music so embarrassingly 80's when this film is made in the late 90's?
I was working in a gas station, late one night, when a pair of would-be robbers tried to get the drop on me.
I laughed my butt off when I saw ATTACK THE GAS STATION!
Attack the Gas Station is a semi-serious comical ride of what some slightly confused youth do when they're bored, and nothing more.
What funny about robbing a gas station................Well when you watch the movie your going to fall in love with charaters i mean these Guy dont care about nothing.
I really enjoyed when the hostages has to fight each other when bulldozer is feeling bored.
is not only the most entertaining film Korea has produced during it's recent industry boom, but one of the most fun, tongue in cheek, genre-aware action/comedies from anywhere since heck knows when.
Although the tagline of Attack The Gas Station (1999) is `Just when you wanted to laugh, here they come,' it might as well have been `Idle hands are the devil's playthings.'
Using guns would have made ATGS much more serious and disturbing, when it is mostly satirical and relatively light-hearted.
This contrast is highlighted when the director evokes difference and misunderstanding about several points commented by the two characters.
Certain sequences can be judged as conventional (like the one when Pierre explains to Marie why he wants to put an end to their love affair) and I think an extra touch of passion would have given the movie more strength.
The film is best described as a movie equivalent of the 'bodice ripper' paperback romances which appeal most strongly to the fair sex but men often also enjoy, and when televised they provide ideal entertainment for a couple.
Unduly short sequences handicapped by excessive or inadequate contrast are used today by too many directors when attempting to create atmosphere or mood; ignoring the fact that this mood can be irretrievably lost once the audience starts wondering what they missed in the lost parts of the screen image.
She is tempted in several scenes, and finally, when she falls into Satan's tramp, she starts a rampage of sex and murder.
For example, when Sister Maria takes care of the sick cow, or when she realizes she's been tempted by the Devil.
First, when Sister Maria seduces and later stabs Marcelo to death.
The other scene, is when Sister Maria is stabbed to death by the other nuns.
I remember this show from when I was a child.
But even when I saw it back then, I had an appreciation for the relationship dynamics between the female and male lead.
It's OK to have CGI (which wasn't available back when Night Gallery was done) but don't get so caught up in it that the story suffers (or is nonexistent).
Even when she feigns a fall on the staircase, all she can get from O'Neal is a sarcastic comment.
The tide is turned when O'Neal discovers a spider in his kitchen sink.
I was in the 8th grade in 1969 and had already discovered the joys of motorcycles, owning a 50cc Roma from Italy for about a year when the show debuted.
I was 16 when Then Came Bronson was broadcast, but I still vividly remember moments from 6 or 7 of the episodes.
But Scorpion's revenge ain't against the system, baby, even though she does manage to fuck it up a bit on her way out; it's with the people who killed her man and sent her away, and when she breaks out with another fish in tow, a blind girl looking for her own justice against the sleazeballs who offed her Latino guitar-picker boyfriend, and discovers in a staggering revelation that her husband faked his own death in order to kill a bunch of shyster lawyers who were suing his company (not a spoiler!
And when the climax finally reveals the plot, even the dense can see the implications and relevance to contemporary events in the 21st Century.
I've watched it when i was a child and now as a young adult again.
they only just recently opened a new one across from the Public toilets, the old bank   they only got Bendigo bank now , the Pub that they used has now Been Reopened was closed for a while, they only had one pub for awile down near Primary school end great people there nice lunches the emppty Bakery still there, the supermarkets still there, the chemists still there, most hasn't changed they still use the football Ground minyip-Murtoa alternate games between Minyip & Murtoa got a lot of friends both places   i remember going into the Milk Bar where i met Viki Blanch she was nice some talk to you for a while especially when their between shots
I liked the show less at the end when all the focus turned on 'what was happening in Coopers Crossing' in stead of the 'accident of the week'.
**SPOILER ALERT** Lora herself ends up on the receiving end of a straight right, that almost knocked her bottom teeth out, courtesy of Nick when she dared to try to call the police to get them to rescue little Desney & Nanny.
It was when Lora's good friend, who got her the job as a nurse in the first place, the kindly but looking the other way, in what Dr. Ranger was doing, Dr. Arthur Bell, Charles Winninger, finally grew a pair of you know what and not only came to Desney and Nanny's rescue, in defiance of the evil Dr. Ranger, that this horror or horrors the wanton starving of the little girls finally came to and end!
My favorite line is when Stanwyck, after wrestling with the drunken, neglectful mother, looks down at her passed out on the floor and says "You mother..." I won't give away the ending, as it is a bit bizarre, but this is an entertaining film.
Remember that a great part of America was rural when this film came out.
A hard-as-nails demeanor that only comes out when it needs to, otherwise she's just an innocent looking charmer.
Something is really wrong when you see malnourished kids in a purportedly wealthy home.
Earlier in the film Stanwyck kind of winks at the rules where Lyon is concerned and she makes a friend who comes in real handy when dealing with Gable and Harolde.
The pace is fast and the interns are hot on the make, but Lora falls for a bootlegger when he shows up for treatment with a bullet in his arm.
Lora stands up to Nick as only Barbara Stanwyck can when she's steaming mad.
No problem for Nick, though, he clocks her a couple of times, (the camera cuts discreetly when Lora takes it on the chin) and down she goes.
So catch up with this neglected period when you can, especially if the movie's from Warner Bros., like this little gem.
That's because Captain Picard and his crew were fresh when they first appeared after decades of Star Trek starvation.
The most ridiculous part when the crew states that getting home is not really the most important thing to them.
I saw them when they were originally shown on TV here in the UK but had forgotten most of it.
Naturally as I fan I would have liked to have seen more about what happened to the characters when they got home but that's left to our imagination.
Especially when they come out of the Borg subspace corridor and say their location is right where they thought they'd be after they'd said they'd have to go in a corridor that leads back to the delta quadrant.
Tuvok was good at times, especially when he lost his logic, gained emotion and was friends with Neelix.
Young hitch-hikers Gary (Michael Burns) and Chay (Meg Foster) make their way around California together, hitching rides when they can and spending evenings under the stars.
It's surprising for a director of his age to make a film so economic, so mature and hiding the director from the viewer when it's all depending on the director.
The magic of this film is found in the simple every day incidents that make up our lives...like going to the beach or wondering who is at the other end when the telephone rings.
When we grow to know someone all our lives, how do we function when our conditions have changed?
Marie and her husband are on holiday in the picturesque south-west of France when at a deserted beach, the husband goes for a swim but never returns.
It was a truthful and honest portrayal of how we cope with loss; when we are so used to living our lives, taking our loves for granted.
I don't see any purpose The only time, it made sense to me was when she was teaching and reading from an English novel, otherwise, it didn't make sense in other places.
When death is so sudden there can be the illusion of life continuing, particularly when a couple have grown together for so many years.
The general lightness of tone might indeed startle in light of the subject matter, plus there's even an astonishingly erotic moment when Marie imagines herself being groped by both husband and lover in an elegant masturbatory fantasy.
The use of lighting to accentuate Marie's moods is quite effective, like the use of harsh white light when she is in obvious agony.
This is what many lovers feel when they realize the physical intimacy was only skin deep and temporal.
However, Marie is armed with several defence mechanisms which she uses when directly confronted with her true situation.
In the first instance, when confronted by Amanda after the dinner party and after a lecture, Marie uses changes in language to switch the tone of the conversation.
It seems that she can feel more comfortable and isolated when speaking in English, and perhaps she was able to use the same technique before Jean's disappearance to exert her own individuality within her marriage.
Later in the film, as Marie's defences begin to get breached, she resorts to both anger and insults in order to keep her personal reality from being destroyed.. she transcends her calm veneer for the first time when confronted about Jean by Vincent, and when confronted by her mother-in-law she resorts to petty insults.
This series of reactions seems to come to a head when she returns to Lit-et-Mix to face the final reality of her husband's death.
Despite these deviations from established psychological writings, Marie's behaviour does in part correspond to some of Freud's theories as set out in "Mourning and Melancholia", in particular when he describes mourning as the process of "reality-testing"6.
The most explicit "reality-testing" scene occurs when Marie is lying on her bed and is caressed by six hands, those of Jean, Vincent and herself: It can be seen almost as the transition sequence between two of her realities.
The scene in which Marie passes out when seeing a cemetery could be seen as a reaction to Jean's death, but could equally be interpreted as her reaction to her own mortality.
"Sous le sable" tells the story of Marie Drillon, excellently performed by Charlotte Rampling, whose husband disappears when they are on holiday after he went for a swim in the sea.
Years ago, when he was at the beach, he saw a woman who's husband was went for a swim in the sea and didn't seem to return.
As a fond of Ozon I was really happy, when Russia became the first country where "Sous le sable" was presented.
What does she believe and when does she believe it?
Her behavior from then on becomes increasingly erratic, which is an indicative of what happens to a person who's become so attached to another and the horror that slowly arises to the surface when those ties are suddenly, irrationally severed.
A particularly disturbing moment arrives when Marie decides to embark on an affair with another man who comes into her life: Vincent (Jacques Nolot) which establishes that maybe reality for her has finally cracked.
However, when a person is so deep in denial, those things matter little, if at all.
Jean remains ubiquitous in Marie's life, he is always there and only disappears in a few scenes when reality comes in her life for a second.
Many film fans run screaming for the door when confronted with French film drama.
Also, when you put two different cultures together you learn a lot about each.
I'll never understand, what with the literal thousands of other types of beings/creatures of shadow/darkness, film producers and screenwriters always lean on the old crutch of Christianity when conjuring their creations into being.
Sorry guys, but if I wanted to be repeatedly hit over the head by dogmatic Christianity, I would let the fundys in when they knock on my door.
And then when Nikki walks out of the church with her baby, He just stands there and WALKS away?!
Anyway There is a part where the ass**** teacher is playing a blues type jam, and had said he hates it when a student is better then him, well it seams that is easy cause he sucks, he had no licks, no soul and no vibrato...then the film seams to play him up as the "mentor" when your ear can tell you he blows.... what grounds then does he have for yelling at the kids, when his own playing fails to impress..The one kid I hope keeps rocking is the 12 year old who at the end plays a amazing solo, kids got it....(teacher don't) thats all oh yeah, most adults who act like the butt monkey teacher end up profiled as weird........aside from the yelling I act the same way its fine, however I play a meaner blues and I am not as much of a honker as said butt monkey....Ps I know my grammar sucks, then again this is not about me........Peace movie fans M.Run
Bert Hughes is home alone in his Manhattan apartment,trying to work out a major change in his trust company when a noisy rat starts scratching around his periphery and he becomes obsessed with exterminating it.By the time Hughes is through,his whole apartment is nearly exterminated-and his friends are keeping their distance due to his rat-mania.Pretty suspenseful and effective rat invasion flick with terrific central performance of Peter Weller.Several memorable moments were the diner table discussion turned to rats and everyone felt uncomfortable;and the end battle with the rat.There are also some very effective jump scenes that were finding the cat on top of the refrigerator and the toilet scene.Overall,"Of Unknown Origin" is a fine animal attack film that deserves rediscovery.8 out of 10.
Lots of repellent closeups of the rodent performers helps to maintain the creepiness factor of the picture, and there are some great sequences as the rat runs amok throughout the place (the moment when the infernal thing pops up out of the toilet was a fantastically orchestrated shock!).
I was so happy when this movie was over, but ever happier I gave it a chance.
The plot sees a man who recently completed the rebuilding of a house being left alone when his wife and child go on holiday.
He stays behind to try and win a promotion, but he doesn't count on an onslaught of torture when it turns out that the house he put together has become infested by a rat.
Of Unknown Origin starts out slowly, but builds some momentum half way through when our hero begins his personal war against nature.
Smug, anal, successful and ambitious detail-oriented Wall Street yuppie businessman Bart Hughes (exceptionally well played by Peter Weller in his first lead role) has his cozy and comfortable life thrown out of whack when a large and crafty rat invades his fancy brownstone apartment.
So we are guided through a time when some students are preparing for a Frank Zappa festival in Germany.
I think I jumped a foot when the damn thing came out of the toilet.
Perhaps we are better off having not seen him, but the outside of that nightclub came alive when JStew shouted.
This barely passes muster as a TV movie, the "unrated" version is beyond laughable.Steer clear, this film blows harder the the real Mrs. Fleiss did when she was getting started.
Eye Candy: Most of the time when you see Jamie-Lynn DiScala naked it's a body double (I know BOOO!!
), but the first time when she dances for Robert Davi you can see a nip slip, not much I know but the best you gonna get; also Emmanuelle Vaugier shows her ass   My Grade: D-
Like cherries on a one armed bandit when they line up you should give a decent pay-out.
I could make all sorts of observations about how the writers, actors and director had no clue of how to make this story resemble... well, a story, however, suffice it to say that the care invested in the production of this film is evident in the total lack of any pretense to recreate the period of 1987 to 1993 when the film is supposed to take place.
Lets face it, this story is a sleazy one and when you tune in you know your not gonna see a story about little bo peep.
I think the makers were trying to do the "little girl lost" thing but all it did was make me really not like Heidi fleiss-especially when she stole her former boss's business.
Since when do we, as Americans, always have to "see the point of view" of those trying to do us harm?
The ultimate display of creativeness of vivid imagination from the effects crew is the Predator when revealed in full glory.
The casting of this movie is near perfection, except for Shane Black who was offered a bit part when he was not needed for screenwriting duties.
Although this sounds reminiscent of the 40's and 50's when Hollywood capitalized on people's fears of a threat from outer space, this movie far transcends those B grade movies.
Dutch uses all his capabilities to overcome the predator, but when facing his end the predator sizes him up as an opponent worthy enough to face unarmed.
'You know bro' whoever did this to you is gonna' comeback, and when he does I'm gonna' cut yo' name into him.
The most powerful scene in 'Predator' is when Bill Duke together with the rest of the group stands in the forest shooting wildly all around the trees without knowing what they really are doing there!
John McTiernan (director) created a stroke of genius when he let us see through the predator's eyes.
Having not being born when Predator came out, the first I heard about any sort of Predator was the Alien vs.
Not so simple when a high-tech, seemingly invisible, 7'2'', extra-terrestrial Rastafarian hunter is picking them off one by one and keeping their skulls as trophies.
Freeze frame the film when he zooms in and you will see a single frame shot of a man in a white vest with an explosion/lens flare behind.
I was a student at Rock School for year when I was 13 and was the subject of much derision and psychological abuse from both other students and Paul himself.
Even when the movie slips into excess (which it frequently does, with gratuitous flexing, absurdly over-the-top firefights, and unabashed macho banter), it does so with such a boisterous swagger that you can't help but hop on for the ride.
We ACTUALLY CARE when these guys (who would be called "side characters" in most other action movies) are picked off by the malicious demon that hunts and haunts them.
This is a very important movie to people (especially guys) of my generation--I remember re-watching it repeatedly when I was ten or eleven (probably too young!
Back in a time when the term "popcorn movies" actually meant something, Predator stands out especially today, mostly due to its high quality writting and top notch action.
This movie never gets boring, as we watch the characters interact with each other, it brings to mind the feeling I got when watching the Marines from Aliens; a great feeling of comradary and gruff friendship.
Its really alot of fun to watch the Predator hunt these hapless soldiers, when just a while ago they were kicking ass everywhere they went.
The scene when the team attacks the rebel camp is, without a doubt one of the best in cinema, since it shows each team member providing something in the attack, and it's not just one guy who acts like a one-man army and destroys everything in his path all by himself.
However, things go awry when it turns out that they aren't the only ones with weapons there.
At times he's cringe-worthy, but it's hard to deny his prowess when it comes to the action sequences, and that is all a film of this nature needs.
When I first saw just a brief part of Predator when I was about five, I was freaked out and scared to even watch the movie for many ages, but eventually, once getting older, came to like it.
The Predator, played by Kevin Peter Hall, is a very realistic and believable creature for the 1980s, when this movie was created.
I really like the music and especially the spooky twisted jungle sounds that we hear when we see through the eyes of the predator.
I still can't believe my eyes when I see the camouflage effects; it blows me away that even now in 2003 it could sit alongside the FX seen in TODAY'S films with no shame.
Then there's the fact that no one notices Cassie speaking to what would appear to be nobody at all, even when she's in a crowded room with people right next to her?
And when Ella shows up, no one notices that she wears the same outfit every single day?
It shouldn't be a welcome relief when a main character "bites it", as we say over here, however when Ella sticks it to Cassie we find ourselves really applauding a situation for the very first time in this show - SEVEN EPISODES IN!
Don't be discouraged by my enthusiastic answer either, I am very critical when it comes to film and television, I am a film maker myself.
We have really enjoyed the show thus far and are looking forward to seeing it next year, but will not be thrilled when the show comes to an end.
Paul Green is a really good teacher when you think about it.
Legions of fans that the networks do not care about or listen to when they are asked to bring them back!!!
i started watching this show when bbc America started airing it here in the states i watched the pilot because i thought it looked a lot similar to buffy the vampire slayer(my favorite show... rest in peace).
Especially Thelma, who is the best character of the show, makes a lot of bad choices for selfish reasons.. but she also makes good ones, and like when it came to Amy, who can blame her?
Some people seem put off by the "tough love" thing that is part of the instruction but it seemed to me that the only time he got impatient was when it was obvious that certain kids weren't trying their hardest.
I can't wait to see Michael Fassbender in "300" when it comes out.
Samuel Jackson has to crack you up when he says to Tommy's new-found drinking buddy: "Your wife likes the city because she is a city girl, and you are too!"
And Carol Kane is wonderful as the feisty bartender who keeps Tommy in line when he needs it.
Sure, there are those of you who think that musical rebellion knows no politics, but when you aren't at least a libertarian, when you're truly in the conservative jock headspace, your attitude and danger are as safe and salable as mayonnaise.
This is a good movie to sit and watch on a night when you have nothing else to do.
Only one question why is Sam L Jackson on the back of the box when he has all of two lines?
Obviously, Buscemi knew exactly what he wanted when he wrote this character, and he puts it across with a brilliant, memorable performance which also demonstrates his ability to star in and carry a movie on his own.
The coolest moment of Rock School, however, is when the very top students are flown to Germany to play at "Zappanele", the largest Frank Zappa Festival in the world, and they perform with an original member of Zappa's band.
It's done in a very ambitious way, incredibly sophisticated and elegant when we know the budget who was assigned to the movie.
Lars von Trier is a genius when he actually makes a film, as he did with Element of Crime and Europa, two visually stunning films that I absolutely love.
Or when he looks in a mirror, turns to us, the camera, then the mirror again.
My daughter was in absolute tears when the blanket got taken away .
Paul can be a dick sometimes, but he isn't as bad as the film portrays him to be, i think he kind of over reacted when the camera was around just for show.
Just when you think there are no more laughs to get out of an asthma joke -- there's another!
remember when voting for this, that it is meant for the under 5 crowd.
I really dreaded this when it came to my daughter via my mother, but it is well done, turns out, and quite amusing in that something-for-everyone Sesame Street way.
It does have lots of funny parts that only a kid will find funny and a parent will roll their eyes when the kid is not looking, but on the whole, it's amusing.
But, lets focus on the film here; it is funny, moving and shows what kids can do when expectations are high.
I did not think that this film would be that good when I rented it, but this is a film that stays in your mind forever and makes you think in a different way for the rest of your life.
I first saw this film when it was screened on the small screen by the BBC here in the UK a couple of years ago.
There have been few other films I've seen that made caused me to weep (big, macho guy that I am ;-)), particularly those that are often mis-labelled as "war movies" -- "The Killing Fields" being another of this ilk -- when, in fact, they're really (if we're labelling things) human interest films that come about because of a war or conflict.
but a film to be spend when u feel like watching a good one.
the song the mother sings towards the end of the film when the terrorists keep killing the travelers does not only make the child to put into sleep, but am sure your viewers throats would have become harder.
My wife is a Croatian citizen, and her family fled the country in the early 90's when the region first began to break apart, just hours away from being swept up into the war themselves.
I'm not going to comment on a review as such BUT the internet TV view listing I saw when I went to see if it was going to play again said that these kids had gotten good "dispite" the way the teacher had gone about doing it...  To me it's funny how a little rough language towards the kids says somehow the teaching method was a failure.
I was placated into thinking that was how life worked, then wham, the reality of musical life hit me when I went on the road in the real world.
But it's such a good movie that you should see it, when you're in the mood for a very sad story.
Where was everyone when Welcome To Sarajevo and The Thin Red Line were on?
Then when the child comes into the picture he suddenly softens up and everything is ok.
I wish there had been something like this when I was younger rather than my 70 year old music teacher who had no idea what was going on in the music I was listening to at the time other than the certainty that "that's not music that's just loud banging and screaming!"
Teaching kids to rock is a noble calling indeed :) Can't wait to see it again when it comes out proper.
Stony-faced Dennis Quaid is excellent as ever as the emotionally-shut-off mercenary tiring of the pointless and unresolvable fighting in Bosnia, slowly allowing himself to feel again some years after the horrific death of his family when a woman and child inveigle themselves into his life.
No one here is a good guy, in fact everyone is bad to a degree, especially when you understand who everyone is (a fact not readily understandable to the casual viewer).
Can any tell me when this incident happened ?
War is obscene and when you compare this movie to BEHIND ENEMY LINES you can`t help thinking that Hollywood is even more of an obscenity the way it portrays the Balkans conflict  Peace out  
I noticed this had been produced by Oliver Stone when I saw it for sale, thus my reasoning for snapping it up.
Most of the time actors are better when they have nothing to say but alot to express.
but there is no fun in this game this game is garbage and the controls suck and the camera is bad when you try to move it up or down and the story is the worst of the seris.
Changing into the Dark Prince happens when the story calls for it, not when the player wants it.
Life energy slowly diminishes when playing the Dark Prince, which gives a certain amount of pressure to move and waste enemies fast in order to replenish energy quickly, but we already saw something like this in WW, when playing as the Sand Wraith.
It is nice that you can use this techniques to quickly get rid of a few enemies when you are faced with many, but there isn't much variation in speed kill moves, and it takes away a lot of opportunity to go into an adrenalin-pumping free-fight frenzy.
Speed kills become much more varied and useful when fighting the mini-bosses, and the resulting battles are quite spectacular to see.
But just like the Dark Prince appearances, they come only incidentally and they're over just when they become fun.
It's a way to take out opponents, typically when they aren't yet aware of your proximity, and all you truly need is to get the timing right, albeit the first time you try the specific ones, before you know what's coming, you will have to react split-second, as well as not get trigger-happy.
I grew up on Atari and Nintendo when you had just a couple of buttons and very simple tasks.
Fighting the opponents was the same, and when the prince turned into the Dark Prince the fun was just beginning.
It lacks the slap stick humor your used to when watching a cartoon.
An interesting British entry to say the least dating from those dim dark days when William Hartnell was still 'Billy' but at least got a credit unlike Bernard Miles.
The camera starts on his hands, so you only see what he's doing-- pasting newspaper clippings about lurid murders into a scrapbook-- but when his face is finally revealed, the whole audience seemed to sit a bit straighter, and we stayed that way through the end, reacting with open delight to this character's every movement, his every phrase.
I'd call this film a crowd pleaser and everybody seemed pretty excited when they left the theatre which is always a good sign.
At the very last scene when it reverses you see him get shot outside of the bus and also the shake is thrown on his clothes at the bank from the girl.
Substitutions for the F-Word such as "flaming" just aren't funny when they come out of his mouth.
I don't mind the silly physics of time travel, but I do dislike lack of common sense when movies are made.
The glint in the actors' eyes when they deliver their lines.
And Astin's not far behind -- anyone notice the line on the plane when they're all about to go to hell in a handbasket?
I give an 8 only to movies that still make me think about them the next day; and when I feel that I have to recommend them to others in the confidence that they will like it too.
Afterwards you have the satisfaction that you have when you just saw another good bank robbery movie, or a hijack movie.
Interestingly enough he chooses his one and only love interest as the teller (imagine how happy she would be when she found out that he had been tricking her).
But in the end (do not read further if you don't want to know the end) Tanner is saved when Conway, who is shot, activating the machine.
But I was amazed when I watched it at how much fun I was having.
Actors are really playing bad, quotes are stupid (even when they try to have some scientific background), often in the movie we have these vomiting camera shot making circles around the characters (the bank scene is the worst scene I have ever seen in a movie, I laughed all along).
So if this unreal scene was not enough, we have that strange bus driver who runs when the FBI agent tries to cut off the bomb.
probably the best part is, when the time-travel-ipod-like-gadget gets hooked on via USB to a laptop, because it's screen broke.
The girl who played the FBI agent's acting was a laugh, when she walled up the hobbit after her partner was shot, that was hilarious.
However, this ended when with the spinning camera scene inside the bank.
Finally, I'd just like to say that when Astin's character managed to drop the time travel PDA thingumajig for like the eleventh time, I really started to hate him...  3/10
And, to all you aspiring directors, when faced with a script with no feeling and actors phoning it in, don't forget to use slow-motion.
when he sees Duwayne staring at himself.Why?Belial laughs wickedly after Duwayne explains about wanting to be normal.Again, I ask why?Sure, they had a nosy reporter trying to expose them,but not much else.Gore and violence seems like it was just thrown in, to keep the audience awake.But even the violent scenes are poorly executed.The one liners thrown in by Duwayne after a violent act,made me groan in pain.I wanted to throw rotten eggs at him.At least Freddy Kruger knows how to throw in funny oneliners.Then there is the scene that made me cringe(BRRR).If there's something I never want to see in a movie,its this.I never want to see ugly people naked or have sex,and I never want to see ugly monsters naked or have sex.It had belial and Eve having sex,ARRGHH!Eww, that was something I can live without.I'd rather have my toes cut off!And that painful excuse for violin music sounded like it was played by a dog.Woof!The musical score is Laurie Anderson bad.When Duwayne tries to get it on with Susan,we find out,(SURPRISE)she's a marsupial.And she has a disfigured sock puppet pop in and out of her pouch.The biggest pisser of all, is the fact this was a ripoff of "Nightbreed",a much a better movie that came out a few years earlier.The freaks in that movie were better made,plus the story and plotting were well written.Watch "Nightbreed" instead of this dreck.0 stars for this junk.
This is when things really begin to get strange.
Godzilla movies(not the Japanese ones), Ultraman and old kung-fu movies are enjoyable in much the same way as basket case 2: so bad that you sit there laughing hysterically because someone actually took themselves seriously when writing something completely asinine.
The story is of course silly but it also still is a notch up when compared to the first movie.
Sad when Cheyenne left -sad when the dam series ENDED.
This show came out when there were a lot of first run syndicated programs.
The only nice picture in the film is when they move to the house on the beach.
An aging film director returns quickly from Madrid to Buenos Aires when he learns of his nineteen-year old son's drug overdose.
Also, notice the triangulation effects in the photography when there are only two people in the dialogue.
They are really deep and make you think about many things in your life, especially when you are in the age of Hache, and you donÂ´t find ways to mature.
There are phrases in this film that i know by memory and i use with my friends when we are joking.
See it when you are sad.  
Maybe I've seen it over five times, and still I cry each time when Federico Luppi stands on the balcony talking about the desperation of life after the idea of loosing his son misunderstood.
Once or twice in a lifetime you watch a movie that strikes you exactly in the moment when you need it, and you feel completely identified with it.
That happened to me today when I saw MartÃ­n (Hache), commenting on movies is a very subjective thing to do, you can like a movie even if it's a flick just because you needed someone to tell you what the movie is saying in that exact moment.
I laughed out loud at the antics of Botts when trying to get away from the practicing of our hero.
The funniest scene takes place when Jane Wyman, Victor Moore and David Niven are striving to drive the one bad tenant, Potts, out of the Cleopatra Arms by having Niven come and do his 6-8 hour piano practicing in the room next to Potts who works nights and makes everyones life miserable by yelling at them to keep quiet so he can sleep days.
He elicits an embarrassing performance from Broderick Crawford as an ill-tempered tenant who sleeps during the day, and yells at everyone with such murderous violence you fear he's going to go on a killing spree, when it's obviously a subplot that's supposed to be played for yuks.
i had seen this film when first released in early 85. though the pacing is slow and deliberate i find myself hypnotically fastened to the visuals aided by a good john lurie score.
so i may be simply nostalgic in an odd sense when i watch the film.
I am wondering when it was last aired since its initial release.
"Payment on Demand" begins when David tells Joyce that he wants a divorce.
I had heard it had flopped when it was released.
It was critically blasted when it was originally released because of the "high" cost at the time.
He's also gives a great emotional baring when he realizes that he may have lost what he had.
Saw this in a near empty cinema when it came out and enjoyed it all the more.
It really is a lonely feeling when you know you love something as much as this and other people cannot see the beauty in it.
The problem is, as mentioned, when the characters have to read the lines, which have only so much development as a stunted fetus.
Despite all the efforts put in by the unconventional leading players Frederic Forrest and Teri Garr, plus Raul Julia, Natassia Kinski, and Harry Dean Stanton in some clever and juicy supporting roles, and even a couple of moments of real, genuine heart and heartbreak (the latter being of note when Forrest tries to sing "You are my sunshine"), t's just too thin a story to nearly justify all the effort put into it.
It totally stiffed at the box office (I think there were 2 other people in the theater when I saw it), but it is an exceptionally fine, unusual flick.
The marriage of a bickering couple in a fantasy-version of Las Vegas comes to a boil when the wife decides to leave (she wants a little excitement, but hubby is a homebody); both he and she link up with other partners, but will married-love win out?
The country music by Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle hopes to work as a narrative theme, when actually a stronger screenplay might have sufficed.
I first watched this movie when I was on my own and it made me think of my girlfriend .It is so fantasy in a modern day setting that it cannot fail to enchant .I don't know if it is charming or stark but it does have realism in an unreal state .The story is simple but nevertheless believable .You know how they feel !
Their lives change when they go to a bar with some business associates and encounter LoÃ¯c and Marylin, a cross dressing brother/sister act.
The author of "le Boucher" (1970) and "les Noces Rouges" (1973) excelled when it came to depict vignettes of provincial life, in the Kunstler's shop and apartment but also in the town itself.
Before this, one of the key sequences is the one when the four protagonists are together in the hotel room because in this moment, the persona of Jean Marie and especially Nicole is well construed and defined.
Jean-Marie's answer is meaningful: "however when we started, you wanted to be the first one to help me to settle here...".
As for Jean-Marie, he appears hesitant and undetermined but maybe would he like (unconsciously or not) change his life in spite of an eloquent sequence: when he takes LoÃ¯c downstairs to show him concrete memories of his first years spent in the shop.
The white of the dry-cleaner's sharply contrasts with the half-murky, dimly light rooms in the apartment, especially when LoÃ¯c is in these rooms.
A tension caused by several factors: disquieting moments or lines pronounced by LoÃ¯c, by the contrast between the appearance the couple gives to the customers and employees and what lies beneath this when they are in the apartment with LoÃ¯c, especially when the latter finds himself with Nicole.
There are, of course, other substantial differences, where Mr Sloane came, as it were, out of nowhere, Loic (Stanislas Merhar) is first encountered by Nicole (Miou-Miou) and Jean-Marie (Charles Berning) Kunstler in a club where he is performing a cross-dressing act with his sister Marilyn (Mathilde Seigner)and only goes to live with the Kunstlers some time later when Marilyn leaves both him and the act in favour of life with her boy friend.
This story of a French couple, middle class business people leading a life that they only find boring when they encounter a young, free spirited and unisexual man, takes some weird turns but does it with excellent performances and direction.
However, it is his best, when all of his sub-Neitschze philosophy, violence, and common hatred for authority came together.
The defense attorneys looked foolish and even incompetent when cross-examining the prosecution's witnesses.
I don't know what this director though he was getting into when he made this movie, but he did do a very good job in making a case to the completely uninformed.
I saw this movie when it was released and have been looking for a copy of it on DVD since then!
I live a few blocks from the Cedar St home, and was shocked when I heard what happened.
I dÃ­d hear prosecutor Freda Black talk about the "filth" she found on Peterson's computer, talking about the homosexual pornography she found ("no relationship, but pure sex") and the triumphant look in the other prosecutor Jim Hardin's eyes (though he did his best not to show it) when he found the pornography.
No murder weapon, not a decent motive and not one decent theory by the prosecutor about how Michael Peterson could have killed his wife (judge for yourself when you see the staircase of the title).
We get Lucille Brown as the "Prairie Flower," and Leroy Mason as the head villain, also from the better 'Texas Terror' (1935) in which Lucille gets more screen time than the villain, and when finding out that John Wayne is indeed a good guy at the end, rushes to his cabin to spend two hours alone with him!
There is still a lot of punching and kicking and throwing of dough, but the plot becomes a lot more serious when the disgruntled bakers sneak some dynamite into the ovens!
A decent film that is head and shoulders above other Chaplin films of the time, though awfully crude when compared to his films just a few years later.
While the script remains frustratingly superficial when exploring the film's central romantic triangle, and in spite of its lopsided focus on the tribulations of the one straight male character, Camp still offers many characters and scenes that delight.
Some are groan-inducing: for example, when the group starts doing a new piece by the cynical, self-pitying, alcoholic composer, it brings him around and he joins the band.
GREAT SONGS, and I even cried when the fat black gril sang a song to express to her angry dad that she is fat and that is who she is.
Despite the not so good end scene, this movie leaves you with a feeling of great joy when you leave the theater.
Its the only line i knew and i would catch myself randomly singing it in my head when i was doing boring work or just walking around.
Bottom line: not a bad movie to watch when you know you will be distracted as it requires very little of your attention and there are enough action scenes to move the pace along, but science fiction and Heinlein fans will be disappointed.
This movie is beyond words when it comes to being a unique feel-good movie.
The plot seemed a little disjointed too; Vlad's character continually reveals more complexity and conflict up until the very end, and I felt like I was just getting to know him when the movie finishes.
For anyone who's into musical theatre, or was when they were younger, can relate to this movie.
Only then can they realize how much they would have wanted to see a movie like this when they were teens.
Despite being one of the key dozen or so science fiction writers of the 20th Century, relatively little of Robert Heinlein's work has been filmed and, with the exception of Starship Troopers (turned on its idealogical head), nothing from the 60s onwards, when his work started to carry more serious subtext.
I don't mind it when it's there for a purpose: here it service no purpose whatsoever.
I saw it when it first came out, and it seemed hopelessly dated then.
of ill-repute who somehow once ended up in a Mexican jail for 2 years and is now on the path to recovery when a couple of bank robbers kidnap and use him for a heist.
His mug is prominently featured in the robbery photos and then the fun ensues when he goes to his ex-wife's (Hawn's) house to engender her help after being let go by the robbers and being fully on the run from the law.
Hawn is the wife of the L.A. district attorney (Charles Grodin), while Chase is the ex-husband who comes tumbling (literally) back into her life when he finds himself in a desperate situation.
Chase is forced to take part in a robbery and is on the lam and shows up at her house and several inopportune moments - like when she's entertaining the governor.
I love when Glenda and Ira are trying to have dinner with the Governor, and Nick poses as a waiter.
As the story begins, Nick is forced by two criminals to participate in a bank robbery and when they let him go (albeit while their vehicle is in motion), Nick figures Glenda - who he's never stopped loving - will be the only one willing to help him.
At one point, Gould remarks during the climactic trial how he loves it when time flies by.
It seems that Chevy was minding his own business, when he is kidnapped to rob a bank by two ex-cons, who make a habit of getting trusting faces to do their work for them.
I have loved this movie since I saw it in the early 80s when I was in Junior High.
There are plenty of amusing sections: Chase fighting back fear and hysteria when he is with the kidnapping bank robbers (when he compliments the wording of the bank robbing note, the robber who wrote it thanks him); Hawn's fighting for the underdog legal practice, which results in her having a growing number of clients she is helping to get honest employment for - even in her own household; Gould's judge trying to get to the point of the ridiculous arguments and fact patterns that first Hawn and later Grodin put into his court; Grizzard's governor looking forward to dinner with his future attorney general, and his favorite dish, only to find the state's number one criminal is serving it to him.
It does seem like old times when you watch this movie.
Note to all involved: A guy saying "turtle" in a weird sheepish voice isn't funny, and it certainly isn't funny when you've had him repeat it 20 times within five minutes as the only attempted joke in the entire scene.
Bottom line: not a bad movie to watch when you know you will be distracted as it requires very little of your attention and there are enough action scenes to move the pace along, but science fiction and Heinlein fans will be disappointed.
The jokes and situations were weak and when it finished we were saying " what the hell was that all about " Sorry to say we found this a big waste of time , but my workmate told me her boyfriend really likes this movie , so I guess you should watch it and judge for yourselves .
i first saw 'master of disguise' when it came out on DVD in early 2003. i remember it being funny, but now i see it as being kind of silly.
I can only imagine how he must have felt when this wrapped and he looked at the finished product.
He was great in both "Wayne's World" movies, he was one of the reasons "Saturday Night Live" became funny again, he's always been hilarious when he's guest hosted SNL in later years, and his stand-up comedy, most especially his 1995 HBO special that aired frequently on Comedy Central, is uproariously funny.
However, being that Heinlein was one of the few sci-fi authors I +didn't+ read (I'm more of an Asimov and Bradbury fan myself) as a kid growing up, and I haven't seen the original film, I didn't have any problems with this movie when it came out in theaters.
He worked great when his movies stayed within the 15-30 demographic.
Sometimes you can't even tell when the jokes had happened.
I especially enjoyed the references to other movies like when Grandfather Disguisey shows up Father Merrin style or when Pistachio shows up at Bowman's party disguised as Tony Montana.
Dana Carvey is an extremely talented comedian,which makes it a shame that his efforts since his Saturday Night Live days have fallen,at least for the most part,miserably flat.The latest effort,The Master of Disguise,is no exception.This film is horrid from top to bottom.It is a poor execution of what was a poor story idea to begin with.Executive Producer Adam Sandler's ideas about comedy may work when Sandler himself is in the film,but he has yet to produce a good effort when solely behind the camera.Carvey's efforts to make this a good film are indeed valiant,but he can't do it alone.Even the character names (Pistachio Disguisey?)
it happens near the end when it's discovered boomer has a twin...john ma runs past onlookers, then boomer follows him.
there are SEVEN occasions when people faint after seeing twins, which wasn't funny the first time.
Many of the themes expressed are basic human emotions and fears, but when forced to confront these demons of human experience is where the real horror lies.
And when the father of the thumb-kin accidentally hatches it by pouring milk over its cuticle, you truly know that there is no turning back.
As I said above, a fluent knowledge of Freud and Jung isn't compulsory to enjoy the imagery, but it really does help when trying to ascertain the underlying story that makes up the crux of Pandora's Paradox.
The acting seemed like it was way better than your typical student film but it was hard to tell when the parts we're reduced to annoying laughter and screaming.
He trusts his actors and knows when to let them steal the scene and not the camera, SFX etc.
What happened to the days when stupid horror flicks that are good only for laughs were at least witty and clever?
It didn't come, and hadn't come when I walked out almost an hour later.
Finally, it occurred to me that it probably showed up from time to time on the Fox Movie Channel; so, not having it on my cable system, I started buying the monthly satellite programming guides, and when it came up in the rotation on FMC, I had a friend tape it for me.
That night, when they finally make it to the cabin, all but Derek and Sam are ripped apart by a blood-thirsty, werewolf who can talk human and cracks wise!
And, the idea he'd really stand a chance against Mitch in werewolf form, when he gulps as the human step-dad approaches him is a bit of a stretch as well.
This seemingly innocent plot thread is exploited when she is forced to perform oral sex on Derek's evil step-dad.
It has a nice start to the film but when we get to the story you will have figured out the werewolf way before the middle act and your left with a lot of stupid decision making by some of the characters to pad the running time (ex.
I am always pleasantly surprised when a movie comes along that I have no expectations about and then it turns out to be a lot better than many other, well-known releases.
This movie is not a non-stop gore-fest but it does sprinkle enough claret around when the action gets hairy.
Brown then you'll love her in this movie when shes always cussing up a storm somewhere along the film.
Things go sour when a vicious werewolf shows up and kills everyone except for Derek and Sam.
Son Derek (Trevor Duke) doesn't get along with stepdad Mitch, and things only get worse when he steals the key to Mitch's secluded cabin and heads out with some frat buddies, their girlfriends, and his pal Samantha (Kim Brown of The Guiding Light).
Just when things are heating up at the cabin, a werewolf bursts in and kills everyone but Derek and Sam, who narrowly escape.
The films flaws come chiefly from the tone, which varies between gruesome and joyously politically incorrect and a cheesy almost Scooby Doo or Famous Five vibe when the two leads are investigating the werewolf.
So when gems like this come your way, go out of your way to find them.
The action is tight (when needed) and the gore supplies.
Even more amazing when you learn what a short time-span they had to put everything together and learn their roles.
Things soon take a turn for the worse tho when they find out there's a horrible redneck family who live in the area where they set up camp.
For example, in the beginning we are introduced to the two single elements which will play out implacably for the remainder of the film: confusion in regards to which of the twins is who, and how when one of the twins performs one action, the other is psychically affected and carries it out as well.
None of the men are portrayed as saints: even Bottoms' nice-guy intern doctor, David Rand, has a laugh at a barmaid's expense (when the boys stop at a bar to stock up on brews).
Mason also gets in a spot of bother when the hunters accidentally stumble upon the poachers at work, and gets in a vicious scrap with Snake, a slimy looking redneck played by Billy Drago.
Things soon take a turn for the worse tho when they find out that there's a horrible redneck family who live in the area where they set up camp.
Most of the time when you enter a portal, you will flip upside-down , or sideways in a way that it will leave you desorientated for a brief few seconds and thus very vulnerable to enemy attacks even with the most 'elite' shooterskills.
There is also times when you can actually change the entire formation of the level.
During the times, it can be discontenting, especially when you walk from one ground to the other.
However, the one big flaw is when you die.
The thing that surprised me the most was the long lasting storyline that kept going even when you thought i would end but a small downside is the Multiplayer.
It was when I heard that IGN gave Prey a good review along with various other sites, I decided to try it out.
Prey is enjoyable and somewhat stupid because when the enemy is about to throw a grenade they call out, "Grenade" and then you can easily avoid it.
These games, when released, were instant classics, and will remain classics until we actually start to be able to feel the sweet squish of virtual Goombas beneath our hyper-technologically clad feet.
Games like RE4 and HL2 set the bar pretty high when it comes to what's outstanding and what's average, therefore making it somewhat difficult for designers to take their audience's breaths away.
I usually don't consider graphics when playing a game because I'm one of those people who prefer game play over graphics, but Prey had me astounded.
Even when you die, you carry on playing.
Well basically when you die you get taken to a kind of Cherokee limbo, where you must use your spirit bow to kill the "dishonored dead", and by doing so replenishing your health and spirit.
And when I finally got the courage to, I felt sorry.
Prey simply has to be one of the best games EVER to grace this planet, and, when it eventually lands in the bargain bin in ASDA, it will stand proudly in Game Heaven alongside Final Fantasy VII and Super Mario 64.
Importantly, when the material shell dies, the spirit lives on, ultimately allowing for a return to almost the exact spot where Tommy died.
Instead, it's the design that matters, even though Prey boils down to another corridor crawl when all's said and done.
It was sort of a step-back in time for those of who remember when families were close and shared Sunday dinners along with great conversation around the dinner table.
I saw this series a long time ago when it was aired on TV.
Well, I initially saw this movie because I am a major Carrie fan and I wanted to see another movie with Amy Irving when she was still young.
Once again, I first saw this Movie on my Mum and Dad's old Phillips V2000, when it was first released onto the U.K's Home Cinema market (hired from a seedy old Video rental shop on the Woolworth road), and boy did it leave it's mark!
Which, when they come, seem to hit you with the force of a speeding freight-train!
Boy, doesn't time fly, when you're having fun!
However, if you haven't...  Trust me, when I say that this Film is a Classic, of the HIGHEST magnitude, and that it would be an absolute crime for you not to see it!
I really liked the opening in black and white when they showed the twins as kids, and I loved the reference to Stallone and The Rocky movies with Tammy's(Nina Li Chi) boyfriend Rocky, plus it has some pretty good fights in it too.
The color is so incredibly fake it's just bad, especially when you have a movie as gory as this one.
It made me feel good when I watched the scene and remembered the interior of the place exactly.
Occasionally there will be something that isn't directed quite well enough even when something interesting is going on.
There's not much gore except for a cool bit at the end that looks like it belongs in David Cronenberg's Scanners (1981) when someone explodes all over the place, it's replayed several times in slow motion & from various different camera angles as well.
It does have a couple of slow moments and maybe it was a tad too long, but it's well compensated by superbly tense situations and blistering action sequences, especially in the first opening hour involving Douglas's character when his son is kidnapped and when his hiding out from government agents.
For some reason when one brother is doing the other one start doing the same thing.
In these sad days when tripe like Three Pints of Lager and a Packet of Desperation gets 7/10 on here it's good to see original and very funny comedy, even if it doesn't last long.
My favourite example of the writing has to be in episode 3, 'Skipper the eye child', when Rick Dagless m.d.
This programme not only makes me think of and laugh about shoddy horror shows, or appalling writing, it also makes me think of the times that I thought that I was a talented writer when I was younger, and wrote lines similar to the one above, feeling very proud of myself.
I also laughed from start to finish, especially when Alan Arkin discovers the basketball phenom.
The show didn't exactly set the ratings afire when it was aired, but it is tailor made for DVD where all the intricacies can be appreciated.
His improv skills seem to have been allowed to run riot throughout and while the majority of his lines aren't necessarily funny, when they're delivered in Ayaode's distinctive voice, they become side splitting.
I was more then pleasantly suprised when the show proved not only to be hilarious but a much needed break from the vapid 'reality' shows that have come to expunge any palatability from our viewing pleasure.
And lots of slow motion (well, its hard to fill a half hour slot with story all the time)  I'm looking forward to saying 'I told you so' to lots of people when they 'discover' this show in 6 months!
He claims it is deep and inspirational, when in fact it is just shoddy and awful.
His inability to do two things at once when it comes to acting (for example deliver a line and hang up a phone) is hilarious to watch.
Hunger is a great leveller: the General and soldier are the same when they are hungry.
The Girl and the General has a special place in my heart - I saw this late one night when I was about 10 years old when cable TV was brand new and they were desperate for programming.
ThatÂ´s when the fun begins.
I was a senior in high school when Footloose was released.
I saw this movie when I was 9.
In the scene when Wrenn is teaching Willard to dance, great dancing song.
Even now when I watch it on TV, almost everyday I always get up and dance.
The only thing I have to say is that it is so SAD that Chris Penn Died who played Willerd in the movie when I found that out I almost cried because he was found some were in Hollywood and it was i heart attack and he did gained a lot of weight since the movie footloose it you got to his name on this site you will get all the info about his death.
I was nine when I saw this movie and fell in love with a then very young Kevin Bacon.
Furthermore, they are willing to accept defeat when it appears their best efforts didn't win the day.
Yeah when I watched the movie last night I saw the big snow capped mountains in two scenes and wondered what mid west town is this?
I enjoyed it in 1984 when it came out and I enjoyed it 24 years later, watching it on DVD.
It was only when test audiences gave the film thumbs down that he finally agreed to shoot the upbeat final dance number.
my 20 month old son loves footloose he first watched when he was 6 months old and now watches it 2-3 times a day its fantastic and dances every time its on and follows the steps that they perform he knows footloose is about to start as soon as the paramount picture comes up on the screen.
It portrays the timeless struggle between innocent pleasure and rigid morality, when city-boy Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) finds himself in an uptight Midwestern town where dancing has been banned.
My favorite scene in the movie is the very beginning when we see all the shoes dance.
The funniest part is where when Boomer conducts John Ma's concert and doesn't know what to do.
Back in 1984, when 'Footloose' came out, dance movies were very popular.
I used to LOVE this movie, and I remember I got the soundtrack for Easter when I was like, 11 or something.
-One of the funniest moments is when Chuck gets onto his tractor and puts "I need a hero" on on his ghetto-blaster.
That would be awesome to do at a basketball game when you sub in.
That girl can just capture the whole audience when she wants.
And don't get me started on how Bacon, Singer, Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker look WAY too old to be high school students--Singer was THIRTY when she did this!
(Even if I am torn between wanting to cringe and dance when I hear the theme!)
Then, alas, Heather Graham is only worth watching when directed by either PT Anderson or by early David Lynch.
I wasn't interested in the characters when I started this film, I just wanted to see how Burns would handle mediocre talent.
I used to watch it as a kid when I went to my grandparents house (i'm not that old, heh).
If you've seen any Jackie Chan movie, you'll know that he likes to be funny even when he's performing the stylized fight scenes.
This movie was filmed when practical CG was still a little sketchy.
I love these films even when they are imperfect.
I wish everybody would stop complaining about how they can't find a decent guy or girl out there, when they really need to examine themselves first to see if they are even "decent" and ready for a real relationship.
I'd like to comment on other parts of this movie, but Li Chi stood out so much in this movie, that I can't think of anything else when I think of this movie.
In one scene, when Ed is having dinner with his date in the movie with the background music of lush life - such a romantic Jazz tune!
Even his affair is knocked aside when it is inconvenient.
Even when a really melodramatic whopper is thrown in towards the end, it works.
In Sidewalks, he again probes relationships in the modern era, when sex can be around every corner and the more traditional marriage of an earlier age is absent.
I hope I am not being too `broad' and going out of my `way' when I say that their performances is the best ensemble acting I have seen in a film this year.
Her character makes a painful and necessary decision, although, perhaps, we are not prepared for it, when she breaks away from a situation that will only bring her unhappiness, in the long run.
Also, "Mr. Sheffield" barely acknowledged "Brighton" and I cringed when I could visibly see the hurt in his (Brighton's) eyes.
Neither bad dubbing nor shoddy split-screen special effects can sabotage the inspired antics in "Twin Dragons," a nimbly done action farce featuring martial arts sensation Jackie Chan as identical twin brothers separated at birth but reunited year later when evil Triad mobsters try to murder one of them.
By comparison, scraping by on bits and pieces, the other twinÂBoomerÂdevelops incredible skills as a street fighter when he isn't fixing cars.
John Ma leaves the Big Apple to make his Hong Kong debut when the Asian gangsters mistake him for Boomer.
Boomer and hi troublesome buddy Tyson (Teddy Robin Kwan) owe the mob a hefty $300-thousand in HK funds, and they are out to collect when Ma shows up.
The characters are so believable, and ironically (as Potter was dying when he wrote this) they are mostly likable despite their many flaws.
that is, we have little to no idea of what they do when they're not horsing about, making out, or talking about how much of a strain their relationship is to the both of them.
Some of the scores were too contrived, the scene when they were slow dancing and "You are so beautiful to me" song plays; Aretha Franklin singing the words freedom after the coming out scenario, etc.
There's a sequence at a dance when the two boys are staring longingly at each other while dancing with two women they couldn't care less about.
Also when the gay teen tells off the guy he's in love with and the closing scene (don't want to give it away) were also extremely powerful and honest.
when he was crying on Steven's shoulder in the bed room (if you do not know you should watch the movie).
The idea of making a Corsican Brothers-like film with two Jackie Chans sounded pretty dumb when I read about this movie.
Many years later, when the rich and privileged Jackie returns to Hong Kong, he accidentally is mixed up for the poor one--the one that the local mob wants to kill!
I was thrilled and amused when I saw this as a kid - so many unconventional scenes, so many people who don't behave ...  Alright this is not that entertaining for people of today who have lost any attention span.
That makes for good comedy because this is how life is when you constantly overreach: You make a fool of yourself.
It is an eye opener to see the future Hopalong Cassidy in a real cut-up comedy role, back when he looked like a very young cross between Marlon Brando and Jack Haley.
I was very impressed with the nitty-gritty reality in this film about POW's of World War I, in an era when glossed-over heroics and reality-denial dominated war films.
I watched the movie and it transported me back to when I was 17.
Especially, the tension between Steve and Johnny when they bump into each other in a public toilet is so real.
Looking back at this film and when it was released (1999 in the USA) it is startling that the sexual repression that is so prevalent in the film, can still exist in this day and age.
I loved this movie when I caught it late night on a cable channel and am not sorry I stayed up most of the night watching this saga of two boys in love (or, at least one of them played by Ben Silverstone).
Steven came out at the end in a most dramatic way at a school assembly when he accepted an award with John looking on, but John never came out at all.
I lived close to the film's location Basingstoke when this was made and am the same age (give or take a year) as the main character, Stephen.
Mostly it provides an understanding into the pain and confusion one faces when they are gay.
The situations that arise, when one finds themselves serving too many masters, are portrayed in a moving, heart warming manner.
I rented the movie "Double Jeopardy" one evening and was skipping through the previews when I saw the trailer for this movie.
Hilarious complications ensue when one is mistaken for the other...
Like when the two people are making out and melting at the same time.
It was sorta disappointing that people thought it normal when the "immortal" (actually reincarnations) died with a lot of lightning.
Also, when you consider what is out there in the theaters these days at $10 dollars a head (plus, all the other "necessary" expenses - food, soda, etc.)
She's petite, meek, and, even when angry, makes you wonder where the fire went.
Any tension is in the viewer, wondering when it will all end.
If someone truly wanted to make an awful movie, fine, but why use the title and lead characters from Ms. Howard's book when the story is completely different?
I was very excited when I saw Loving Evangeline was going to air on WE.
The always engaging Rob LaBelle makes a fine scientific sidekick (who actually does most of the work - not to mention acting), and Gardiner Millar as the chief villain is solid - even when the special effects have him reenacting the last scenes of the first Indiana Jones film.
I remember when Stephen Baldwin was part of a great film called "The Usual Suspects."
I always wonder when actors turn to films they must know are bad going in, and yet still are part of them!
Kati Patang a movie from Shakti Samanta's stable was released when Super Star Rajesh Khanna was at his peak and was churning hits after hits and it appeared that there is going to be no end to his giving hits.
Then again, it was pretty contrived when Woolrich wrote it.
She show her pride, when Max try to give her a vacuum cleaner like a gift.
The worst scene is almost at the end of the film, in a friend's house, when Max discovers the same model of vacuum cleaner without dust inside.
'), not quite as good as Secretary, but it will fulfill its purpose when I put it in my DVD player.
He's cute when he plays drunk, and even better when he's being molested by Susan Serandon... sp.
It has some inspired comic touches - "the sandwich" springs to mind - a solid chemistry between the two stars, and some touching pieces of observation such as when Max tenderly explores Nora's belongings reminiscently of Garbo in Queen Christina.
Both have had loss in their life, both find each other attractive, and when they are together the chemistry and passion is simply magnetic.
So when he finds her they come back together.
my favourite scene is when Nora (Susan) meets one of Max(James)'s Friends, Sherri.She asks Nora "you know our max is quite a catch.
I bet you do"and Nora answers: "And I bet you don't" You must see the look on Sherri's face  I think it's a great movie because normally hollywood is afraid of a love story about a young man and an older woman.There should be more of those movies because some people think it's strange when a older woman has a love relation with a much younger man.
( I've never thought it was strange and I'm only a fifteen year old girl) But most people find it absolutely normal when an old man has something with a much younger woman.
On the sad day when he passes, this film will serve as a tribute to his idealism and accomplishments during one of the blackest hours of American history.
Don't be surprised to feel awkward, frustrated, terrorized, and satisfied simultaneously when you catch this one.
Martin Luther King, Jr. You'll see images and hear words of that time when it was marvelous to have someone with the courage.
Order it online in DVD when it's out.
I do remember stories of people being buried alive, especially since I'm old enough to have seen the original Vincent Price movies when first released & am familiar with the Poe fears and stories.
the plot had a lot of twists and turns and just when you thought it was over it took another one.
(When they finally met in the interrogation room, there were a couple of occasions when I thought this just might occur.)
Although McGovern's platform was somewhat vindicated when Nixon's White House was outed by Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein as the most corrupt administration in American history (with Tricky Dick's resignation soon following), the tragedy of his loss, and his subsequent fade into the background of American history still resonates.
And just when you think things are about to finish, a really big wrench is thrown in to twist the story even more and have you thinking, "Wait just a darn minute...."  I found viewing the DVD a much more satisfying experience, as you get the widescreen version and better quality picture.
It used to scare the crap outta me when I was young, and even though its not that scary now I still love it.
There is a somewhat good amount of gore and violence, and the creatures look great for a low-budget flick, even though they do sound a little bit like elephants when they scream.
It's yet another "Alien" rip-off created in the early 1990s when rubber monster suits became more affordable.
Goofy dialogue, ridiculous plot devices, monsters who jig wildly when being shot... "Syngenor" truly is a giant among B-grade sci-fi schlock.
Oh, sometimes a door closes and a door opens sort of cut might happen, which is fine, but as far as editing goes- which Altman says is when he starts to get much more in control as opposed to the loose approach to letting actors improvise (and with this, aside from the back-room scenes and really specific ones, there's a lot of it even for a production like Altman's)- it's much stronger than for a regular television show.
Which is interesting since it sometimes has that long feeling of an Altman shot here and there, or one that is held for longer than one might expect in a TV show; one crucial shot being when Jack Tanner (Michael Murphy) is shot unawares by a camera looking through a glass coffee table as he gives a passionate monologue to his campaign team after a bad day.
Shots like these, or when two characters have a conversation for a stretch of time (i.e.
We know how this will all end, but the question of the how and when is what strikes up drama and madness in equal measure, as if even in the most predictable means it adds to the appeal (new campaign supervisors on how to speak more forcefully and with strict attention, then the scandal(s), awkward campaign stops, a not-quite assassination attempt as one of the funniest asides, dissension from reporters).
It's important that they too are right on the ball with Murphy at just saying the right things when diverting from Trudau's script.
Plus, I always cringe when they drag out Yoko Ono to talk about 'music'.
I understand that Ms. Ono is/was an "artist" (atrist, a buzz word I will define, in my opinion, as a pretentious faux-intellectual, pacific rim type entities purposely scoping for burnt out/drugged out has-been musicians/producers/songwriters types to feed into an overblown ego when others wont just to finance their visions so they can sit at home and not ever get a real job), and her musings on "music" to me are about as helpful as an ant walking on an elephant's back.
Many folks 60 years old and older may want watch this because many of these musicians interviewed are musicians/singers/songwriters that generation grew up with and may want to know how they're doing these days, be surprised they're still alive, may want to know how they felt about working in the industry in their day, and how their kids turned out when they weren't even home to see them grow up.
One day, when she sees a book for spells, her first cast will be bringing back her mother to life.
I watched it when I was a kid and it brings back great memories.
This also reminds me of the days when Lindsay Lohan COULD act.
Eve also brings a little wisdom with her when she shows the people around her that life is about happiness and sweetness and simplicity, and that when adults get caught up in petty disagreements and entangled in their "demanding" lives, they are only doing it to themselves.
(SPOILER ALERT:How come Eve cannot read a Menu OR a computer screen, yet apparently CAN read ingredients on packages when trying to make a cake..with hilarious results...and THEN again is not able to read "The Book" ???)
I didn't remember them babbling this much when I met them.
Just laying around your house and do absolutely nothing but watching TV...Unfortunately, I couldn't find the remote when this thing started.
I'm not being cynical, I'm sure you will cry when you're a young girl (aged 8 - 14) or a lonely housewife ( age 30-55) but if you don't fall into any other category, you'll just watch at it and don't move a muscle.
The doll's hair accidentally gets mixed up with that of Lohan's character's mum's in a hairbrush and comes to life by way of Tyra Banks when the spell is complete.
A pretty good film, I really loved the cast rather than the scrispt, so I think that it's worth watching, especially when Lindsay Lohan stars in it.
Their immense talent is wasted on awful, forgettable movies such as this when it should be used in good quality films that zip them off to the Oscars.
Written at a time in his life when he doubted if he could (read: should) be the 'voice' of the forgotten women, the broken woman, the fallen woman, ...the woman that is often invisible in most church congregations, after the release of his novel, the overwhelming answer was 'preach on, T.D., preach on'.
It's not really a surprise when one knows the history of the journey that this project would be his first feature film effort.
What happens when these 'mothers' fall into hopeless situations that seem outside the confines of the normal assistance that most churches are only equip to handle?
I smiled at the end when I realized that in the movie, as in life, we all end up exactly where we are meant to be, no matter how rough it can be getting there.
You just have to see it when it comes out!
If you don't like the way the characters act then take a look in the mirror and when do we ever like every character in a movie?
Too bad so much weight has been given to that one review when others, including seasoned and film-weary professional critics, obviously feel this is an independent film of note.
My favorite timeframe placing was when one character goes, "Man, it is 1988!"
He turns out to be a good man, and when he saves the life of a village woman, nobody wants to see him killed.
He becomes something of a hero when he saves the building of a cafÃ© on wheels being moved from crashing.
There was a line in the script, spoken by Le Capitaine at a point when his fate is pretty much sealed as he takes a moral and compassionate stand in a challenge to those that govern this French island.
Image is starting to be everything when it comes to the music!
Buit when the guillotine arrives by boat, justice must be done and the battle to save Neels life escalates.
The captain's wife saw how difficult it is to survive in a 'civilized' society when you fight for good causes and the wealth for all.
The sea is rough (which partly explains why the murderer rows back to face execution: when every oar stroke is an effort, AND it looks to him as though he's doing the cowardly thing, the effort becomes unbearable).
A burly brute of a man, Ariel's quick thinking saves an islander from certain death when a house being moved slides down a hill.
Moreover, they prove to be unscrupulous because when a new inhabitant settles on the island, they entrust him the role of the executioner without taking care of his opinion.
And when he asks her why she so nurtures him, she replies, `We change, whatever we do.
Things get weird when he attempts to question her, for she runs, and when he pursues her, she is remarkably athletic, and, she shoots at him with a ray gun.
But she learns to use them to advantage, and when she couples them with her feminine wiles, with a wink and a nod, she can be quite effective.
I thought the killer was jsut an ordinary psycho who loved to eviscerate joggers... but when it turns out to be an psychopathic alien fugitive that can disguise itself as anyone it wants, I was put into a mild state of shock.
Many people here have referred to it as a rip-off buddy-film but I wonder if they aren't just buying into the dime-a-dozen reviews; or perhaps they are buddy-film connoisseur's and have some authority on it all when actually this movie deserves to be seen for itself.
The reticence pays off near the end when screenwriter provides the characters with a provocative and literate debate about the nature of war.
I've finally got down to viewing Asoka in its entirety, given that my closest shave was when it screened on television some years back, but I got interrupted with an extremely long phone call, which left me with only 10 minutes into the start, and the last 10.
The film paints a very emotional Asoka that Shah Rukh Khan excelled in bringing out, especially when three women in his life played an important part in his life-changing decisions, such as his mom's involvement for him to see the outside world, Kaurwaki in being his first true, and unattainable love that he yearns and pines for, and his eventual wife Devi (Hrishitaa Bhatt), a Buddhist who would be instrumental in his embracing of the religion after coming to his senses in the aftermath of his most brutal war waged just because of his insatiable appetite for more territory, though of course done in the name of uniting India.
Shah Rukh Khan, India's biggest star, plays the Mauryan Emperor Asoka, who wages bloody wars across the country only to renounce violence when he witnesses the aftermath of the destruction he causes.
Asoka's journey later continues when he is asked to leave the Kingdom of Magadha by his mother Dharma (Subhasini Ali) and for him to go in his own path.
Only thought that comes to my mind when realizing this is, Why?
The only time I laughed in this movie is when EUGENE LEVY's character eats red meat and then gets in SAMUEL L. JACKSON's car.
A battle for the throne ensues when upon Asoka's return home the king passes away and he has to slay his opposing brother in order to ascend to the throne, which he does.
The film is a journey, a character study, of Asoka's progression to the time when he first embraced the Buddha.
I hope sincerely that, when First Look releases the DVD, the film is completely uncut and complete, with ALL the songs.
Shahrukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor have great chemistry together...Kareena is really a great actress when she isn't playing a dumb ditz (such as in K3G....).
You give too little credit when you have no right to judge so hard.
Especially, when you put it into perspective of some of the really BAD and embarrasing films of the 80's that you wouldn't have dared show your non-Indian friends.
My cousin hit it dead on when she said that she (I just looked it up on the internet, her name is Hrishitaa Bhatt) looked like an Indian Alyssa Milano (who I was totally in love with when I was 12 years old during the 80's TV show Who's the Boss?).
Finally, many things of ''Asoka'' remembers me another great epic movie called ''Atilla'', that is directed by Dick Lowry: the way Asoka stays angry and starts to be a monster ,killing everybody after the supposed death of Kaurwaki, is very similar of Atilla 's behavior when his wife N'Kara dies.
But when Asoka returns his kingdom to talk with his mother, he doesn't find Kaurwaki , thinking that she was killed by the Kallinga traitors, he falls into despair and becomes a brutal emperor.
The story basically is how Prince Asoka rose to power to become King Asoka, and can happen when one is overcome with blind vengeance, despair and hatred...  Shahrukh Khan (Asoka) has got to be by far, the best male Indian actor Ive seen, besides maybe Om Puri.
I wanted to know what happened to Davi, and I wanted to learn a few things from Asoka's latter days --when he embarked on his journey towards peace.
Three sisters decide to get some temporary boyfriends when they think they have discovered their widower dad has terminal cancer with only a month to live.
All three situations are insanely funny and combine for even more insanity when they all get together in the house to meet their dad.
Throw your taste out the window, and prepare to witness things you have never seen before when watching this truly outrageous action-comedy directed by Wong Jing.
I love this film when i first saw it, and once i watched it again it got even better.
I suppose a modest production budget made this film look like a typical gritty English crime thriller, with the hand held camera bringing the audience into the thick of the action, either slowly drawing some sympathies from the lead female characters because of the lack of options made available to them, including being on the run, or presenting a sense of clear and present danger up close, especially when pimps Derek (Johnny Harris) and Chum (Nathan Constance) become inevitably close in catching up with the duo for an event they committed, kept closely under wraps.
It began when Kelly, on orders from Derek, went scouting for an underage girl to match the needs of his wealthy client.
Georgia Groome (all of 14 when film was made) is new to the streets.Johnny Downs is the evil pimp, & Sam Spruell as the sadistic son of a client.
The introduction of Derek (Harris), Kelly's pimp, and the potential threat that he carries as a character is only brought into perspective when it is revealed he answers further still to an individual higher up than he is; the son of the leader of this organisation.
As an event which spawns the mess everyone finds themselves in, it is revealed that Joanne is a runaway wondering the streets of London, and is quickly picked up by both Derek and Kelly when it is made apparent a local crime boss, Stuart's father, wants a younger girl to feed some depraved sexual cravings.
Its willingness to have its women act in an independent and strong manner sees them break away from orders in a very male dominated world, that of crime, and renders them characters whom have limits; morals and know that when the line is to be drawn, it must be drawn, no matter what the consequence or whom one is dealing with.
It all starts when Kelly's pimp Derek asks her to locate a young girl for one of his clients; Kelly refuses at first but eventually gives in.
Stuart Allen cuts Derek's leg in a car with a straight razor when he sends him off to find the girls and Derek limps from then on, but we don't see the cutting.
Everyone is begging them and smoking them, and in the climax Stuart tells Joanne how his father stopped him from smoking as a boy by making him eat a pack of cigarettes, even the foil wrapping and the filters, when he caught him with a lit one.
To paraphrase the director, "she certainly won't be allowed to see the film when it released in the cinema".
I was amazed when I saw it at Edinburgh by just how tough and unflinching a portrayal of the criminal underworld it is.
I hope other people who love British cinema see it when it is theatrically released.
The first half of the film has a few pacing problems as nothing truly jumps out and grabs you Â but when the unspeakably effective background segments are interjected London to Brighton receives a well-deserved jumpstarting kick up the arse, continuing down a perfectly-paced path.
Baadshah is a wonderful mix of comedy and drama, and is good for lighthearted fun, although the plot becomes rather fast-paced nearing the end of the movie and some may find it hard to keep up (although I first saw this movie when I was about 10 and I had to read the subtitles, and I followed it fine, so.......) The songs are pretty good, one of my favorites being "Woh Ladki Jo Sab Se", the scene in which Raj- "Baadshah" (Shah Rukh Khan) first starts his job to con Seema (Twinkle Khanna).
Excellent movie SRK does a fabulous job of being serious when you are just busting out laughing!
Amrish Puri was not bad, but he looked to old when fighting with Shahrukh.
Sharukh Khan was fantastic in the film and so was Jhonny Lever.My favourite part in the film is when Sharukh Khan lies to Twinkle Khanna about being blind and Sharukh Khan and Jhonny Lever and they partners pretend that Sharukh Khans house is the hospital.I also enjoyed the fighting parts because it was well put together.
Another unintentionally amusing Irish moment is when our hero pours out some of his deeper thoughts to the priest and the priest's first reaction is to say "You're confused."
And yet another silly scene, involving our blessed Irishman of the cloth, is when he gives one of his grandiose speeches to our hero in a plane about belief in God, and the weather suddenly improves.
The fact he did a comedic part made it worse when he showed up as the evil Tokyo Joe.
But when this movie was made in 1945, the Japanese were the hated villains.
What is also said a lot is the the movie is (too) complex, indeed you have to think and pay attention to get everything, but since when is that not a good point.
I was studying at the University of Amsterdam last year when I would pass the movie theater in Haarlemstrat(sp) and see the announcement for the film.
Award-winning script-writer Maria Goos is at her best here, and so is director Willem van de Sande-Bakhuysen, who was terminally ill when the shooting started and who died shortly after 'Live!
Love will shine when it's against all odds.
Of course, when dealing with such clichÃ©s, acting really makes a difference and the two leads do an excellent job of convincing you of their characters and believably walking with the characters as they develop.
It's always difficult when you want to shake off the past, but yet get haunted by its ghost.
It's a great show and yes the dub may not be 100% accurate or great but you can relate to the characters emotions when in English.
I wish they would find some REAL actors, have a REAL adult story, and REALLY know their stuff when it comes to the D&D GAME ASPECTS.
And while the details were nice for a while, there were times when they were just useless and frustrating.
It'd be good to see a fighter having a go at skeletons and zombies and being terrified and frustrated when bow fire has little or no effect.
It does have some dumb spots, so I'll cover those quick and get them out of the way: 1) A Mage summoning a creature of fire in the library of priceless lore and nobody being concerned or telling her "do that outside", then they wonder when things catch fire.
I was a bit dismayed when I found that it was a sequel to that one due to its cheese factor.
The only flub I noted was when the half elf wizardess teleported them into damadar's lair.
I was amazed when I found out that they were making a sequel to the horror that was the first Dungeons & Dragons movie.
Imagine my surprise when a sequel was announced, and even greater shock when I watched the films premier and found it to be everything I felt it's predecessor lacked.
And frankly who needs an it-would-only-get-in-the-way hokey plot when you got busty'n'lusty Irish redhead hottie supreme Sharon Kelly, the impossibly voluptuous Uschi Digard and the deliciously lissome Sandra Carey peeling off their cloths and happily displaying their delectable unclad bodies with pleasing regularity?
Does he even read scripts any more?, you have to wonder when you see drek like this.
Eugene Levy, nice fella who tickled us pink as Jim's dad in Amercan Pie, simply isn't strong enough to carry a film, especially when his co-worker Samuel is bogged down by a meandering dull and unoriginal script {Piddock & Oberman you should be ashamed}.
I saw this film 17 years ago, and I must say that I found Johnny Yune's performance funny when I first viewed it...
There are two scenes I liked...early on in the bar when the "I'm an Oriental" line gets carried a bit too far and later when Bruce imagines himself as the real Bruce--Bruce Lee.
It's a non-stop, rollicking romp when Bruce is persuaded by a wild and crazy assortment of characters - Texas sheriffs, Vegas hookers, rival mobsters, Kung Fu Krishnas, street punks, Urban cowboys and a host of other wacky, weird people interested in "flour."
Best line- "I'm a sex object, when I ask women for sex, they object"  Trust me on this one.
For me the most important part was the ending of the movie, when the Hungarian national anthem plays (pictures showing to very different places) and I turned to my friend (who is a born Canadian) watching the movie with me: "You can understand now, why we have tears in our eyes when our national-anthem plays... And he understood.
Or: 'am I a traitor to my team when I stay in Budapest to fight the Russians?'.
Nobody likes to be cheated against in sports, especially so when participating in national level events, and worse, having a supposedly neutral referee awarding dubious decisions that work against your favour, even if it's clear cut they're either receiving some kickbacks, or are genuinely blind.
For Viki, it's change that she, and her fellow student leaders, want to initiate, no matter how small their actions are, but soon enough, it became a hydra that went out of control, giving them a little victory, before the big sledgehammer of a retaliation when any typical authoritarian regime respond with their military might.
After all, I was touched, and touched is such a clichÃ© when talking about this movie and the story behind it.
You remember the days when producers couldn't give two s**ts about earning the PG-13 rating?
Nobile was still alive when this film came out, he would die in 1978 still a figure of controversy.
He wisely turns back to Kings Bay when the weather gets bad, he is genuinely devastated at the loss of some of his men, and his actions after the crash are all reasonable.
"The Red Tent", as it was called when released in most of the world, is a fascinating historical epic of Arctic exploration.
Not much to say about THE MAN (well, not much positive), but there's a really odd, homo-erotic moment when the bad guy offers Levy to check him for a body mic.
moments too, like when Levy checks out Jackson's back tattoo, and is there some sort of subtext with all the talk about being shot in the butt?)
It's not funny to see him repeatedly beat on the informant with garbage can lids and phone books and hit him with his car again and again, or the way he treats the local cops when they pull him over.
"Copacabana" is a delightfully naive and entertaining movie from a time when the society was extremely innocent and could buy such ingenuous story.
It is only when he is safely back at King's Bay, that he realizes his actions have been badly misconstrued as an act of desertion.
Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer, and that is when he meets up with his former lover, Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan for getting them to Paris where the Tsarists have congregated after the revolution.
A good example of what you get when a successful actor directs his own movie with himself as the star.
When it starts to get personal, as the killer goes after the Detective, there's even an effective moment when Eastwood finally cracks through emotionally, and one realizes what's under all of that intense, cynical gruff.
In Tightrope the accent is on suspense more than action, though when the action comes it explodes.
Enter Eugene Levy, an Innocent out-of-town salesman who is in town for a convention, when he is spotted reading the newspaper that Jackson's character is supposed to be reading during the meet and is mistaken to be "THE MAN".
Now why did the criminal not kill Eastwood's older daughter (or both) when he had the chance?
The three largely different sides of Wes Block come dangerously close to one another when he starts to investigate a serial killer who frequents the red light district.
This is when the killer starts to play around with Wes and he starts to believe he is his own chief suspect in these murders.
On one hand, he's a wonderfully loving father of two sweet girls (one played by his actual daughter, and played well), and yet he is a weak man when it comes to prostitutes.
I know that the title has the word "silence" in it, and that these men take a vow as such when they enter the monastery, but I think a bit of interaction, explanation, or some sort of definitive purpose would've made the film much more enjoyable.
I wasn't quite ready for the film to start when it did, as I was agitated with other concerns, but as soon as it began my whole inner world was exposed and eventually the quiet drew me in, literally transformed me.
We will eagerly look forward to the DVD (US version) when it comes out later this year.
Thankfully, filmmaker Phillip Gronig, has ignored every "rule" when it comes to making a documentary.
A final note: this movie lasts for about 3 hours, and it is a very encouraging way to assess your levels of patience and consideration, and several people walked out when I watched it.
There's even a moment of laughter and high spirits when a group of younger monks slide down a hillside in the snow (in their boots, without skis or snowboards).
Although they don't take a vow of silence, the Monks speak only when absolutely necessary and once weekly on walks outside their monastery.
The Monks told Groning it was premature and that they would contact him when the time was right.
But when it was done.
The plot has hapless nice guy schmuck dental equipment salesman Andy Fidler (Levy in his trademark character form) is in Detroit for a convention but winds up gumming up the works inadvertently for a sting operation by undercover ATF Special Agent Derrick Vann (perpetually glowering Jackson) when Fidler unwittingly walks into a diner and sits where Vann is supposed to be for a very important meet with an arms dealer who assumes Fidler is 'the man'.
When Vann abducts the shocked Fidler and ingratiating him into the operation at hand well insert the laughter here folks because this is when and why it is supposed to be funny: a fish-out-of-water white tight-ass with an angry black street-smart cop team up to get the bad guy.
But when you do have the right frame of mind, an open and patient mind, you're in for something extraordinary.
And I was happy when I left the cinema these afternoon.
We are presented with snapshots of odd moments: monks frolicking in the snow; preparing a vegetable garden for spring seeding; a summer Sunday outing when monks are free to socialize and, on this day, they discuss the appropriateness of washing one's hands before meals (a contrarian monk has a simple solution: don't get your hands dirty).
Only once a week are the monks aloud to talk when they go for a walk in the woods or glide in the snow during winter.
The degree of nudity seemed a bit intense when I began watching it, but I quickly adapted to this stylistic choice.
I was lucky enough to see this with my dad (cool guy) when I was a kid at the Cinerama Dome in Hollywood.
The b-17 segment still is as exciting and creepy as it was when I first saw it.
That simply blows you away with it's beauty (Listen to the Den sequence when the queen flies on the dragonflies, how the trumpets and the lower brass are sequestered by two themes, one rising, on descending.)
This movie came out when I was 17 and I remember going to the Midnight Movie on Ridge Road in Griffith, IN.
Since when does the future have to be overrun almost exclusively by trashy people?
But when Andy arrives in Detroit, his simple decision to get a bite to eat lands him right in the middle of the sting operation Vann has set up in an attempt to get the guns back, nab his partner's real killer, and clear his own name.
The movie also gets it wrong when it represents the agents as the good guys (BATFE has a terrible reputation among other federal agencies, and a worse one with gun owners Â deserved on both counts).
Also the part when she fell asleep in the cab, you could see that blue thong and the sex scene, INTENSE!!!
I only know the name because when I change the channel to the channel it's on, it'll show the name) I'm gonna call them and ask them to put it back on direct TV.
This movie is pretty sad, the animation is terrible, especially when compared with a lot of stuff that was coming out of Japan at the same time(Vampire Hunter D).
Every story, every piece of music ... God, every shot for that matter -- they all bring me back to being 10 years old and wrestling with my older cousin as she tried to block my eyes when the chick Harry Canyon picks up off the street strips and slides into bed with him to the tune of Journey's "Open Arms."
I have to admit, I loved this movie from when I first saw it.
I remember around 1984 when a release was planned, and a dispute with the multiple musicians caused it to be pulled.
I bought a pirate copy when i was in Japan in 1988 (On Beta no less), and almost played it to death.
And having been a fan of the comic when I could find it, I think it told the stories very well.
I was in my twenties when this show was on and I loved it, too.
I wasn't even five years old when it premiered on ABC, yet I can vividly recall the theme song.
They actually showed reruns of it back when I was in grammar school, and I never forgot it.
Man, I loved Tenspeed and Brownshoe so much when it came out.
Instead we get someone almost as angry and a whole lot more impotent: he threw tantrums when it's obvious that his bad-ass character would beat Levy.
I was SHOCKED when it did not continue to run in 1981.
There was less wonder and excitement when they were involved in other worlds and more condescension.
I cried when Arturo died ,It was so sad, that and the fact that I knew It would never be the same.
Then when the characters started dropping off like flies we should have know the end was near.
I only started watching again when Collin showed up because he brought humor once again.
I remember watching the pilot and anxious for the following week when the following episode was on.
I have been hooked right from the start, and it really ticked me when they canceled it after the first year, and then moved it out of Vancouver.
I saw the cartoon 'Page Miss Glory' on TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES for the first time in about 10 or 15 years and it brought back for me good memories of when I was a kid and a rushed home because I knew that the 'good' cartoons were going to be on Channel 5 here in New York.
This is back in the days when we only had seven channels, kids.
But on the other side, when do you get to see an Indian actress play this kind of role at that point in her life?
It is hard to imagine how Gulzar came out with a movie like Aandhi when Indira Gandhi had imposed an emergency in India during that time.
This movie was a hit when there  were 2 giant movies in competition.. "Deewar" and "Sholay".
Many years later they meet again when she is already a big political leader.
Sen displays both coolness and a pinch of arrogance while playing the strong politician, yet convincingly switches it with warmth and cordiality when she becomes a suffering woman or a wife.
Frankly, I'm an A&C fan of their horror genre, preferring to mix laughter with thrills when I watch those Universal films they made, like HOLD THAT GHOST and A&C MEET FRANKENSTEIN.
Bud & Lou mistakenly join the army when trying to avoid arrest on the street, this sets us up for them to flip the army upside down with a series of sequences that are refreshing in what was obviously troubling times out in the big bold world.
Some may love their songs, such as the famous "Boogie, Woogie Bugle Boy", but as for me, I thought the music was a huge distraction and I sped through these numbers--I'd already heard them when I'd seen the movie when I was a kid--and I'd already suffered enough!
Oh, and seeing Lou in the boxing scenes took me back to when he watched Stan Laurel also fight in the ring as a spectator in The Battle of the Century.
Well, when they started work on their first Fox feature, the movie they made, Great Guns, came on the heels of the success of Buck Privates and if one looked at the original script of the Fox/L & H picture, you'd know that indeed the studio wanted to capitalize on the Universal/A & C blockbuster as evidenced by this unfilmed exchange between Stan & Ollie: O: Wait-, S: What's the matter?, O: Don't throw the water out there!, S: Why not?, O: The sergeant is just liable to come walking in!, S: What's the matter with that?, O: Don't you remember?
The Andrews Sisters are lovely as always, especially in their first appearance in the film, when they sing "You're a Lucky Fellow Mr.
Abbott and Costello's first major success, this film was a tremendous hit in its day and wound up beating 'great' films like CITIZEN KANE and HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY when 1941's box office receipts were counted up for the end of the year.
One thing that does irk me is whenever another character we're not all that concerned with gets too much screen time when it's mainly A&C we're hoping to see.
I was startled when I noticed it.
The closest they came to a falling out, rumored to be instigated by those jealous of their success, was when, several years into their film years, Lou asked to have their 60/40 split of the take (60 Abbott/40 Costello) even'd out to 50/50.
I first saw this movie when I was five years old, and I LOVED it!
Repeat viewings of "Buck Privates" deliver a warm nostalgia for a time gone by when things were simpler and patriotism was a cherished ideal.
If it is ever on TV tape it (chances are it will only be shown when sane or sober people are already asleep).
I haven't seen his movie since the early eighties when I rented it.
My favorite scene is when these two surfer buddies are too enthralled with their surfing stories to notice both of their girlfriends have unclothed, they finally notice and comment in a Spicolli manner, "You guys are nude," then they go right back to their surf discussion.
There's a great scene when one of the kids drinks it, and goes nuts slam dancing around his bedroom to thrash music, nobody can get him under control.
Transitions are so smooth that it seems almost real, like it was something anyone would do when reflecting.
Though he is quiet most of the time, the viewer will feel almost every emotion he does, even when his face is plain as a blank piece of paper.
i first saw this flick on hbo, when i was eight, didn't see it again till i was 15 and found it in a video store, i rented it over a hundred times and eventually wore their copy out.
I was 14 when this movie came out.
A 10 for the shear audacity the filmmakers had when concocting this masterpiece and a 10 for the fact that you will never, never, never see this kind of film being made for movie theaters ever again.
As he often does Poirot just happens to be on the seen when a very filthy rich American heiress, the Paris Hilton of the Thirties is shot and killed while on a honeymoon on a Nile cruise.
I remember being terribly excited when Death on the Nile was released in 1978.
It may be something as simple as the look Davis gives when some Egyptian children "moon" her from the shore or it may be something as elaborate as Lansbury's over-the-top portrayal of the over-sexed writer, each character is played to perfection.
The story (originally penned by Agatha Christie) is set in the 1930s - the golden age of detective fiction - when murder investigations were much less clinical affairs than they are today.
I was a Bette Davis fan before the film and when I saw it upon release I was introduced to so many other performers that I have this film to thank for that.
I watched this film when it was broadcast on channel four last Christmas and I was so blown away by it that I had to buy the movie on DVD.
The scorned Jackie pursues the couple wherever they go, and when she follows them onto a Nile cruise, it seems that Jackie is not the only one who has a motive for murder.
The chemistry between the main characters is marvellous and at the end, when the final solution to the affair is presented, the audience is shocked when they learn who did it, appreciating fully the extent of Christie's genius.
Lyddie is one of my favorite books for quite a while now, so when I found the film on video I decided to get it.
The shots, underpowered, and it's a bit underwhelming when I'm used to even pistols coming across as these loud, near deafening, definitive things.
I saw it in 1957 when it came out and the whole audience in London yawned their way through it.
One perfect example of that is when Jack and Jon go visit the home of where Jack's ex-wife and daughter live.
But Walsh nevertheless finds The Duke and is about bring him back but when Mardukas claims that he has difficulty with flying the airline throws them out of the plane, so they have to go back on the road.
When Walsh's boss, learns that he didn't arrive when he was suppose to, he sends another bounty hunter, Marvin, who is Jack's greatest adversary, to get Mardukas.
And when Marvin cancels Walsh's card, they don't have enough funds to make it all the way, so they have to scrape everything they have.
I was lucky enough to see this one in the theatre when it came out.
First of all, it pleases me to see De Niro when he is at his prime, or at least a lot younger.
when his daughter runs out, to give all her babysitting money.
There's no blood spraying all over the walls, but realistic aftermath when someone decides to hurt some other.
This was made back when producer / director Martin Brest made GOOD movies - not notorious box office duds like "Gigli".
We are usually willing to suspend our disbelief when watching comedies.
No such need when it comes to this movie - the plot, the relations between characters, their motives, everything works like a flawless machinery.
I have seen it twice - first when it appeared more than 15 years ago, and then again yesterday.
But really, when I'm so desperate for downsides that I'm nitpicking the EDITING, you know it's a great movie!
He delivers some of the best punchlines, when he replies: 'Well if you don't cooperate, you're gonna suffer from fistophobia.'
Someone please explain why this didn't clean up when it was released because I can't see anything else that came out in '88 that comes close to Midnight Run.
Tony Leung's bad cop performance is a class on its own, particularly when he finds out that he's been set up and is now in an untenable situation.
One thing to remember is that "Perfect" was made during a time when "going for the burn", and "no pain, no gain" were the buzz words throughout the fitness industry.
Jamie has said herself "Jee, I was HOT", when she was watching the movie with her daughter Annie and one of her friends.
Question: what do you get when you take Tony Manero and ad body oil and a script that single handedly reminds us of ALL the reasons the 80s sucked?
I rather liked it when Curtis meets Travolta at the end and they drive off.
There, is when it should have ended.
Later, there is a short scene of some of the settlers playing cards, which seems superfluous at the time, but it pays off towards the end when one of the men is killed, the cards spilling from his hand as he falls.
Griffith spent most of his career using his serious pieces to dramatize society's problems, even when he had no solution to offer, from WHAT WILL WE DO WITH OUR OLD to his last credited directorial job, THE STRUGGLE.
Then, when that is over, we see a wagon train moving west.
But I always have so much fun when I see him delivering his lines with that almost incomprehensible accent of his.
I grew up with this series through my teenage years as it was shown at Swedish TV4 daily during the afternoons when I got home from school, and I became totally addicted to it.
I have so many old friends who i keep in touch with and miss, yet when we're together it's obvious how different we all are now.
One friend said - I feel just like I did when i was 21 and I had to say back - why would you want to do that, you're 32!
For the most part, I thought the balance of humor and pathos worked really well - there was one scene that I thought stuck out but I can't remember what it was...it may have been the transition into the speech in the school yard or when the guy is dancing on the roof.
i particularly like the the whole maid scenario, those are some of the best scenes of the movie, like when she is making the bed and this old geezer grabs her.
I met Randy Quaid many years ago, when I was bartending at a bar in Toronto.
Maybe it's just that I lost my wife in Dec 2007 to a one car accident that makes me a little introspective when it comes to movies where impending death is the main theme and your choices or ability to choose what you do with your time left are integral to the story.
The scene when he works out was really funny as well.
Shale excavation actually does turn a profit, especially when oil prices are high (as they would be if/when reserves begin to run out).
In this film, however, power from solar, Hydrogen, and wind sources are all dismissed out of hand as impracticable alternatives and cannot, or will not, be developed before we all suddenly starve, freeze, run amok, or whatever they suggest is going to happen in twenty years when oil reserves are suddenly depleted.
You just know that when a supposed 'documentary' begins with the comment "Oil is the excrement of the devil", that it will be an educated, well informed, unemotional and unbiased presentation....yeah right.
Addictions of any kind can result in catastrophe when the supply falls short or the costs rise beyond reach before curing the addiction.
Loved the scene when "Scar" got his scar - beautifully shot, great use of combining black and white with color.
My criticism of the film would be in its editing - some places seemed choppy, I'm certain a few of the interviewees were cut-off in the middle of their last word (in the edit, not by the interviewer) but this nitpicking is insignificant when you think about what these people are telling you.
When you have seen it there is a recognition, as when you get news/information/diagnosis that makes you go AH !
I saw clips of the movie on the internet and I was amazed on how they were funny, especially the scene when Candy unintentionally almost destroys the entire police station while trying to find a pencil or when he hilariously fails his shooting test in the gun range.
I saw this film many years ago, when I was first discovering Cary Grant and going through some of his big films, and somehow it never made a big impression on me, and I largely forgot it.
Some scenes just didn't do that much for me, especially when Cary is playing the piano and the dog is "singing".
Now about the plot: It really seems very odd to me that we never DO find out what Cary was up to when he was supposed to be in Florida.
And I don't think anybody has made a strong enough point of this yet: when Irene is lying there in the bed there, man, she is HOT!
People are quick to mention "Bringing Up Baby" or "It Happened One Night", but both of these films run a distant second and third when compared to "The Awful Truth".
They are Lucy and Jerry Wariner, a married couple who decide to divorce when they feel they can no longer trust each other.
This film really hits it's stride when Jerry and Lucy go to court to battle over the custody of their scene-stealing little dog Mr Smith.
But just when he starts to get comfortable Scar threatens to tear his world apart again and Caleb sees just how different things have become without him.
He is great as a man who is giving his ex-wife to be a hard time, when she gets engaged to a rich southern oil man.
Grant and Irene Dunne have been married for awhile (we later learn in court that they met when both fell in love with a puppy in a pet shop), but both jump to the conclusion that the other has been having extra-marital affairs (Grant, in particular, is funny growing disgusted and angrier at Dunne's fairly blameless voice teacher Alex D'Arcy).
Tho sure enough love never quite runs as expected, and can indeed be a truly complex thing, especially when the other parties involved are human, a cheeky cat, and a rather smart and astute canine!.
What's odd, then, is that Jerry spends the first half of the film trying to win Lucy back--when *he* was the one who hadn't trusted her in the first place.
Lucy spends the second half trying to win Jerry back, after he falls for the same misunderstanding again when he happens upon Duvalle hiding in the other room in her apartment.
Irene Dunne is beautiful and very funny in her role as well (mild spoilers ahead), especially when she assumes the role of Lola Warriner to mess up Jerry's situation with Barbara.
Best scenes may be the night club sequence when Dunne gets stuck dancing with Bellamy, and the party where Dunne pretends to be Grant's sister and yells out, "Hey wait a minute!
I thought it so hilarious, I taped the dialogue on a tape recorder when it was shown on local channels.
Nominated for six Academy Awards (including Best Picture and Best Screenplay) and a huge box office hit when originally released, THE AWFUL TRUTH is a screamingly hysterical marital comedy that hasn't lost one iota of its punch in the seven decades since it's release.
Grant was an absolute master when it came to delivering one liners, and the prowess that he displays in the film's many moments of physical comedy is nothing short of phenomenal.
My favorite bit is when Irene crashes the Churchill household with Cary there and pretends to be his drunken floozy of a sister.
The contrast of her well-bred demeanor and inner wickedness is a delight -- like when she does a "hoochy" dance for a parlor of society snobs.
He's at his best when he takes nobody and nothing seriously, and he's especially funny at tormenting the slow-witted Bellamy.
In steps George Peppard, playing a former deputy, who comes to town and eventually gets caught up in things when his better sense tells him that he shouldn't stay.
As for Peppard, he becomes the reluctant hero after Flood pushes all the right buttons, and especially when he makes the move on Molly Lang's (Simmons) stagecoach business.
Strong points are when Kopps is breaking its own screwball form with the action fantasies of Benny (Torkel Petersson) as an American super-cop.
But the cops' life stops smiling, when they hear that the police forces are possibly going out of order, due to the low amount of crime.
Several people walked out of the theater when I saw this movie.
For example, when the "kopps" accidentally blow up the previously mentioned snack bar, Benny's first reaction is "Oh sh*t!
This movie got Beethoven in the mood when he becomes a father to 4 puppies.
Dad is nonetheless infuriated when he discovers them, but is once again pressured by the family into keeping them.
See it when you can.
The janitor of Ragina's place informs Ragina of this and she is disgusted when she finds this out and plans to drown the puppies but the janitor tells her that she should sell them, and make a bundle.
Proper manners: Ragina: Floyd, people in California usually wear a shirt when they answer the door, and they don't talk with their mouth full.
It starts when Beethoven goes to the park and he finds a another Saint Bernard and her name is Missy.
She was cruel to Missy and her kids, she was using Missy just because she didn't want her divorce settlement to be worth peanuts without the dog, and based on the fact that she threatened to kill her babies, Missy should have bit Regina's rear, especially when Regina carried her away from her babies.
On top of that, when Regina wore all red, it made look more creepier than ever.
But, her red outfit did look good when she fell in the mud along with Floyd.
I wish I could find this on DVD, I saw it in 1995 when it was shown on public T.V.
I laughed really hard when George (Charles Grodin) first discovered the puppies in the basement of his house and said, "Oh, no!"
I was so glad when the puppies got them all dirty.
In my opinion it was practically a miracle that the song got honored by the three biggest award firms because the movie is nothing special and a lot of times brilliance goes unnoticed when it is contained in a sub-par film.
My kids love it when I do that.
I did it because when the wife is out, I watch stupid movies; it helps me to realize that I don't like stupid movies.
If you must watch it, have a book on hand for when you feel you might be sick from how stupid a particular scene is.
Barry Bostwick manages to take down and put the cocky werewolf guy in deep freeze until 20 years later when technology has advanced enough to resume the project.
The great memories of childhood included playing sports and watching television (it was ALWAYS on when I was in the house!!).
Frank is a detective who only takes a case when he feels like it or his pressed for cash to maintain his expensive epicurean lifestyle (i.e.
Despite this he proved he was intelligent, quick witted and he had a number of smarts to outwit his opponents, but he was also capable of looking after himself physically when the situation arose (he was an expert in karate, being overweight does not mean you can't handle the rough stuff when you need to, my judo instructor was 19st, the same weight as Cannon, but boy could he move fast when performing various judo throws and moves).
I am 19st myself, but I know that I can look after myself when need be, with my experience of judo.
He proved that a fat man could look after himself and that he was more than capable when it was needed to deal with violent crooks.
Chiara Mastroianni, looking more like her father every day is also on hand to remind us what we lost when her father died and if she bears only a passing resemblance to her mother that's not so important because mum Catherine Deneuve is still very much with us.
And when evaluating their various past relationships, the script never plunges into the kind of overwrought pathos that would be obligatory in Hollywood.
This technique is especially useful when dealing with the visual problem foreign movies have grappled with but American movies have avoided since "Klute" (especially "Pretty Woman"): how to show when sex changes with feelings.
I was thoroughly disappointed when the end credits began to roll.
The most exciting sequence happens when Agent Barnes ends up in a thrilling car chase after one of his own, Agent Kent Taylor(Matthew Fox).
then no one bothers to explain why gud guys were blackmailed to assist the plot when the same thing would have been easier with dedicated bad guys, the role of the rouge camera man, role of the rouge secret service guy, he risked his life just to retrieve the gun (I don't think the bad guys were that pressed on funds that they needed to retrieve the assassination weapon), massive car chases on 2 lane streets, at times even going the wrong way, colossal explosions sparing the lives of just the important members of the cast.
if you notice when he's talking to Quaid in the car and Quaids just talking about being around and thanks him and his partner makes a face and says "Dont thank me yet" ..very subtle clue that goes thru one ear and out the other of most but once i heard it i knew he was either involved or was gonna be killed pretty soon, i was sure he was involved and just as i suspected he was.
a movie is never as good to me when i pretty much figure it out early.
he risks his life for a little girl who he previously had bumped into and keeps her out of harms way to find her mother after an explosion, these events magnify the events going on in his own life(battle with his wife) and make them actually seem much smaller when he thinks about it...good addition to the movie the whole subplot with the one guys brother being kidnapped has nothing to do with the movie.
The movie was put together and shot great, when you just think you're about to find out something from the plot the rewind happens the camera angles are lined up great to keep you guessing.
We watch the first POV from that of the news crew -- however, it is real not a point of view of any specific person, we just follow the action of certain people -- when the story reaches a certain point we quickly rewind to the next POV (kinda) from the same time (which time-code on the screen becomes part of the films laughable points) the first began.
Other than an attempt at a film exercise of some sort, when the film was over I could only ask, "What's the point of Vantage Point?"
The tricks involved are great, in theory, but it seems that the filmmakers needed a lot of padding for the short script and decided hiding information and/or cutting away when the truth is apparent in order to show it later would be a more fun way to tell the tale.
Matthew Fox is a lot of fun especially later on when he lets loose a bit and has some fun.
Sigourney Weaver brings some pathos, only to be cast aside when her story plot is terminated.
Matthew Fox has no reason speaking bad Spanish when his co-pilot is speaking perfect English, Forest Whitaker does his best mumbly, stumbly, heavy faced bit, but his part in the story is simply meaningless, I'm happy he gets to reconcile with his wife and son, but please people, The President has been shot, blown up, kidnapped, drugged and tossed around an ambulance in a multi-car pile up....so is it ESSENTIAL to waste a final shot on Forest talking on a cell phone to his unseen son?
I loved when the guy from "Lost" turns around after he's carrying the President off the stage and looks at Quaid and says "find that shooter!"
Look who lives and look who dies when some of the people who don't look like they're going to live end up living.
Especially, when you're watching Dennis Quaid turn into Superman as he brushes off bullets, or when he jumps out of a car that was T-Boned into a building with him getting crushed in between the car and an 18 wheeler that weighs about 10 tons.
Its when the President snaps awake at just the right moment, after just being drugged, and kloncks the bad guy over the heads with a piece of metal all because the villains conveniently failed to strap him down properly!
The direction and script are also excellent, especially when you consider both are first-timers in the world of feature films.
And probably as those same people say Hollywood is "out of ideas" they get angry when it tries something "different" and would rather go spend their money on Spider-man 8.
I kind of felt like I was putting a puzzle together, piece by piece, and as you see a new point of view it adds more to the story and just when you think you have it figured out it changes again.
Throughout the movie Marcel is stuck with an angry, confused look of "why the hell did I decide to make this movie again when I could have stayed in Paris drinking Absinthe?"
This is one of those movies in which I would have LOVED to have sat with a paying audience as they watched this thing unfold before them when it first came out.
I think William Castle was at his best when he simply made film to entertain, and thrill the audience.
I had never seen (or heard of) this flick before last night, when it aired on TCM.
Inspired in his choice of projects and endlessly innovative in promotion, he is hopelessly at sea when it comes to the most basic rudiments of competent film-making.
You know you're in for something different when this starts off with a title card saying "William Castles presents A Grim Fairy Tale"!
It completely derails at the end when a motorcycle gang pops up out of nowhere to wreck havoc!
The whole end of the film from when the bikers enter seems to go on for an eternity.
Even when they eventually manage to find a beautiful orphan baby girl already rejected by another couple, the endless paperwork and bribes needed to complete even the simplest of tasks leads to arguments and despair.
When Malcom gets a job with a local mad scientist, he finds the doctor is experimenting with reanimating the dead (so far, only frogs) and when the doctor dies, Malcolm tries his hand at reanimating the good doctor, with interesting results.
Malcolm's one true friend is a teenage girl who he then proceeds to have a party for at the deceased doctor's home, and unfortunately things go awry when a crazed motorcycle gang crashes the party.
After the scientist dies and is buried, the puppeteer takes possession of the re-animating devices himself and, inevitably, they come in handy when his relatives die (one he kills himself in self-defense at the scientist's mansion with the help of a re-animated rooster and the other Â when beside herself at Marceau's lateness Â is mowed down by a speeding car outside their house in the middle of the night!
); he takes them shopping and has them wait on him and perform tricks when he invites the girl to the doctor's mansion!
Their idyllic tryst is short-lived, however, when a gang of bikers burst in on them to treat a wounded member of their partyÂ   Watching SHANKS (which is the puppeteer's surname, by the way) right after Robert Hartford-Davis' CORRUPTION (1968), I couldn't help but be reminded of that film's analogous last segment (right down to the 'dreamy' coda); here, however, Castle has a trump card up his sleeve when a biker steals one of the doctor's electronic devices and fools around with the zombified 'servants' Â the puppeteer, on the other hand, re-animates the scientist who, together with the servants now back in his control, beat up the gang.
However things take an unexpected turn when he turns up for work one day only to find the professor dead in his armchair, seemingly from natural causes.
Shanks himself never speaks at all, but the support character all talk naturally when required - except for when they are dead of course!
The acting in this film is amazing, I suspect that Marceau is not the only performer to have a background in mime or theatre, as when he has to animate other dead characters, the movements are always effectively creepy.
But it is appropriate for her character, a set-to-mature-at-any-moment young woman deficient in some necessary growth hormones needed to push her over the edge (that when triggered by a first kiss could ultimately be her ... undoing) and seems trapped in young adolescence.
It has a LOT of bad acting, stupid plotlines and really doesn't do the job of convincing young men (note I say young men: seems that back when this was made, it wasn't all right for young women to do this.)
A bespectacled young man (who looks likes my dad when he was in high school) discusses with his Mickey Mouse-eared friend on why he loves shop class.
Minor spoiler:  My favorite part: when the ship course is changed, and the people on the bridge get thrown all over by the abrupt directional/speed variation while the characters all over the rest of the ship are completely unaware anything had happened.
There was a time when I used to watch this film everyday in the theater and the only reason was Shahrukh Khan.
In order for the excessive animation to sit right, the actors give delicate, careful gestures when the creatures will be unconvincingly superimposed around them.
That's when everything starts to break down.
He takes a nice stroll over when he's "caught" by the decompression.
I remember seeing the preview when I was younger.
She makes all other witches look like amateurs, especially when she used her sorcery.
Her only flaw is when her re-transformation from a bird didn't complete itself.
It's when her right foot is still a bird's.
The growth formula was something when one of the bees drank it.
Zenobia had actually had a confrontation scene by Sinbad's ship when she arrived in a feathered and veiled litter and argued with the silly vizier who was trying to look his best in a day-wear saffron and gold ensemble that was striking for the pheasant feathered adornment of his turban that looked like the whole bird was alive, and in heat.
Her flight is not as lucky, once arrived, she transforms into a miniature version of herself and is unfortunately discovered by the baboon, who wrecks her plan, only after much difficulty she manages to change back to the seagull and escape, but there is not enough potion left when she turns into herself: She is left with a huge foot of a seagull attached to her leg instead of her human foot, and will stomp her way through the rest of the film.
The baboon Kassim looks totally real playing chess and most of all in his dramatic scene when he sees himself in a mirror, and despairs over his change.
Kassim and Dione manage to befriend Trog, and when Kassim is finally liberated of Zenobia's spell, we feel genuine regret as Trog is killed by Zenobia, again transformed, this time as Smilodon the tiger of the snows.
The happy ending in the coronation of Kassim as caliph allows us to admire in detail the Jewelled splendor of his court, the plasticized Formica of the rings, the unique, early zircons and other stones are all mystifying, specially when thrown together with pearls and feathers.
Overall, highly recommended for young (but not very young) children and for adults who were kids when it first came out and want to recapture some nostalgic vibes.
By remembering how old I was when I saw it and WHOM I was with when I saw it.
It was one of those movies local channels threw on Sunday afternoon before or after a televised ball game..or when a ball game was rained out.
Have a heart when watching this.
Watch this as a "fun" romp....as remembering when families watched shows together (..or in my case my dad mumbling under his breath about how the game was due on and he had to sit through this 'crap' first!
Open your mind and when you have a moment...enjoy.
When I saw this in the theater as a 7 or 8 year old kid, I cried when it finished.
The unbelievable stop-motion effects of Harryhausen still look great, even when compared to CGI.
The gold minotaur rowing the boat and the fight between the troglodyte and the saber-toothed tiger at the end stand out in my mind so strongly when I think of this movie.Get a copy of this movie, Jason and the Argonauts, and then Clash of the Titans and you have a fantastic Saturday afternoon of movie watching.
Mun-su's mum was astonished when she returned to the empty table.
Please, everyone know name of song, when Yeong-ju is crying in metro and Moon-su hind her....I like this song..If you know...very please send me email: 46tom46@gmail.com
I had no idea what this movie was, or what it was about when I first picked it up, but I found myself sucked into it quite quickly.
As an attractive actress and a popular commercial model, it's so far-out seeing her dressed-down and wearing plain makeup to portray this hopelessly out-of-luck, clumsy girl, who has to learn English so that she could communicate with western customers who arrive at her office with their problems when it comes to their monthly bills.
Elvis also has problems of his own, because his interest in learning English is to better communicate with his long-lost sister, who was given up for adoption in America due to his poor family finances many years before...  You can totally tell that this film is the first, and probably the only one of its kind in South Korea, highlighting the recent English craze, where adults want to learn English to better improve their business English when it comes to international business, and students learning English through expensive English academies so that they could either study abroad/or live domestically and enter top-notch universities.
It's the unmistakable "country hill-billy" voice that we all can help but smile when hearing.
He also has some fun dialog like "when I gets me enough money I'm gonna git me a set a dem Roebucker-teeth [false teeth from Sears & Roebuck], and if-en I save enough maybe I'll git me a couple-a gold ones" or some banter with his nephew Skeeter that includes words like "mighten" and advice to "don't crowd God".
I remember seeing Goodbye My Lady back when I was a lad as the second part of a double feature.
Any kid like the one I was when I saw this would want to possess an animal like this.
That must have sent up a few howls back when I was a kid in theaters here.
It's terrific when a funny movie doesn't make smile you.
You feel better when it's finished.
We all know what's like when we have a bad day at the office, right?
Well, this Neil Simon comedy looks at what it's like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office.
And, sometimes, it's just not worth doing something when it's already been done before, in 1970, with Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis... and much better also.
That's if you're a New Yorker...  Look, the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere, and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment.
So, when made in 1970, that was the city you saw: grim, dark, moody, unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the Big Smoke (as it was then, polluted and all).
If you want a true comparison the the original was bland, this piece is something else I watched it when it first came out on video and I was with my family and friends , we all laughed and enjoyed it.
The poor people from Ohio do not have one gram or one 176th part of an ounce of luck when they come to New York for a job interview.
Only shining moments belong to John Cleese as the hotel manager who likes to dress up - you almost fall out of your chair with helpless laughter when he dances to Donna Summer's "Bad Girls" while wearing high heels, a mink coat and a dainty hat.
And when I hear Donna Summer's song, it reminds me of John Cleese.
Another scene I liked was when they were in the limo, and a drugged Steve Martin describes his wife as being "Frisky!.
The direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e.
Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis did such a wonderful job in the original, what were the producers thinking about when they cast this one?
It seems at first Makdong is going to let this slide, but when the three men get off the train, the young former soldier follows and cracks one of the three on back of the head with an award he received from the army.
Lee Chang-Dong recently got a lot of attention when his latest movie OASIS one multiple Korean awards.
Unfortunately, when he gets home he is treated to a little dose of reality.
A chance encounter with a young woman leads him to meet a gang boss who seems to be a little more respectable than most, and when he's told he won't have to break the law he accepts a job.
http://www.horror-movies.ca/horror_reviews_2728.htm  Species 4: The Awakening Movie Review  by: Meh   We all know that SciFi films are not exactly the top of the bar when it comes to movies, or horror movies for that matter.
There is definitely not enough gore, almost all the sex scenes were unnecessary, and some stuff just didn't add up or made any sense whatsoever (the reason for Fisk's lies, the taxi-driver and the reason for Azura's actions when they arrive in Mexico - just to name a few).
So why are they suddenly just killing people when Ben Cross and the Blonde chick come into town?
Later on there is a lengthy space battle that clearly came from a different movie awkwardly stuck into the movie in between sex scenes and more of the same footage from the introduction used when the aliens are giving a lecture of the downfall of humanity (Which is awfully preachy for a movie like this).
Things get good during the second half when John Liu, a great kicker also, and Hwang Jang Lee begin to fight.
The Secret Rivals is a bit slow starting as a lot of plot and backstory are introduced but the action heats up big time when the Silver Fox (Lee) drops in.
Characters and fly through the atmosphere, surrounded in an aura of flame and not even have a scratch when they reach the ground.
However, when watching Kung Fu Hussle, the only thing I can use to describe it is "original."
I just laughed my head off when I laid eyes on it.
I was surprised when the Landlady had the power of the Lion's Roar.
Even the Beast could stand up to that, except when the bell was used as a speaker.
Sing wises up after the beating he endured and I think he should have been more wary of con men, when he was younger.
Kung Fu Hustle combines humor, creativity, imagination (WAY out the box when compared to most US movies) epic fight scenes and wonderful cinematography.
There's the disgruntled tenant with perpetual Plumber's butt, the bucktooth and trampy local girl, the chain-smoking landlady and silent and ineffective sidekick who can only grr timidly when asked for backup.
But this movie reminded me of the good old days, when I used to read "Dragonball" the Manga - before the same manga became overly stupid and boring and went too far with the whole "there's always a stronger enemy" thing.
My best friend said, when I told him I'd seen this film, "Wasn't it written by Italo Calvino?"
While not all Americans are familiar with the conventions of the HK Kung Fu flicks of the Seventies (which admittedly does help when viewing Kung Fu Hustle) EVERYONE in the US knows soccer.
What was it called and when was it released?
If the story about Sing really happens, bum shall be some 20 years older than he first showed up when Sing was a small kid.
Being a complete sourpuss when it comes to most comedic film offerings from the last three decades (though I attribute a lot of that to inanity rather than taking full credit for being a wet blanket), I find that when there is a film that makes me laugh so hard that I am concerned about the possibility of a stroke, I have no choice but to rave about it.
Despite a couple of gags here and there, until the end when the Landlady got involved, the scene was playing off like something I would say "cooool" in an awed tone about in a Tarantino film or something.
I was less than enthusiastic when I tossed it into the drive of my Athlon, but a promise is a promise, after all.
I am a Chow fan, beginning from the times when he relied on a deadpan expression, toilet humour, spoofs of other movies and books, and good-ending, heart-warming, small-town/village boy-makes-good story lines.
But of course, when it comes to KFH, one must talk about the sfx.
One day when A-xing goes into a slum, Pig Cage Town, to do his usual extortion, he witnesses a real clash between two gangs: the Axe Gang is clearing out a local gang that has not shown allegiance to the Axe.
For example, when Chow shows his characters practising kung-fu while faced by a middle-aged woman in the slum, he is quickly kicked in the groin.
I was entertained throughout and even though I was dead tired when I saw it in the theater, it held my interest all the way to the end.
Then Game came out, yea when he came out with G-Unit i was psyched.
I don't think I've ever seen one rap artist do that, and, to be honest, when Mr. Watkins said he was doing all this for the fans, I believed him.
when i was watching the movie i kept thinking Mmmm...Jennifer.
This I didn't get until almost the end, when to my surprise, they were uncovered!
It's also quite perturbing to see Jerry O'Connell's brother in this movie as there are flashes when one thinks it's him, but then the realisation seeps in that it's just someone who looks like him!
I could go on and on about how much "Devil's Prey" sucked but then I would be wasting my time as I did when I watched this poor excuse for a horror movie.
Five L.A. teens make the mistake of accepting an anonymous invitation to attend a backwoods rave called 'Straight to Hell' and, wouldn't you know it, that's just what the local sect of Satanists had in mind when they lured them there!
You know you're in trouble when you can spot continuity errors in the opening sequence of a film (check out the disappearing bra) without even looking for them.
There must have been a clearance sale on candles when the Special Effects department went shopping.
This movie is boring except when the really cute young ladies are prancing about, especially if you are viewing the film without the censorship-fuzzies.
The plot is that a bunch of marginal youths who are into drugs and drug dealing get stuck in a satanic cult's land when their vehicle breaks down.
I would say for making a movie during the writer's strike, on a very limited budget, this film managed to satisfy the crowd that I sat in when I first viewed it.
I was in this movie as well, I won't say who I played, but the best thing is to try to make it a drinking game, that's what I did with my friends when they insisted on seeing it.
Their father left them when they were kids, which led to their mother abandoning them emotionally.
They come together at the funeral, but the abandoned clan set off a feud when they dissed the old man.
An example of this is when Son throws away his gambling addiction in order to salvage his broken relationship with his girlfriend.
After solving this problem, another charges against him when he realizes his brother was murdered by the opposite side of his step-family.
The characters in this story are highly dysfunctional victims of destitution due to a lack of strong parental care when they were younger.
A memorable yet haunting monologue given by Son is when he blames his cold-hearted mother for the violent rivalry within the family: "You taught us to hate those kidsÂand now look what's happened."
This line demonstrates the seriousness of causality and its potentially detrimental effects when children are raised to hate others because of an unforgiving heart.
The film's moral purpose, then, was to show the precarious consequences of what happens when the family is destroyed.
The father of this unfortunate trio abandoned them when they were at a young age and they grew up in the home of a bitter, vindictive mother.
The tragedy begins to unfold when the three brothers learn of the death of their father.
Ever want to know how those supposed family feuds happen, when two groups end up killing each other on site?
There are deaths in the film, and when it happens midway through, a sense of loss, of sadness, and of rage is felt by the audience for the remainder.
The older sons were abandoned when young and when they turn up at the funeral held by the younger sons, old hostilities surface.
Missing from this performance were both of Fairfax's solos, as well as "when a wooer goes a-wooing", "strange adventure" and the duet "Rapture, rapture."
Unlike the usual TV hacks, he uses close-ups sparingly to conserve their dramatic impact and smoothly allows the camera not only to focus on the wider scene but even to employ extended long shots (a double no-no on TV) when these are emotionally warranted.
That's a failing if you really want authenticity about a New York detective, particularly when you compare it to "Naked City" which was filmed on the streets of the city.
I was'nt even that lucky...a spoof is always more entertaining....Ramu's factory is stagnating...he should try to become creative for a change...all the characters were so stereotype...the lead Randeep Hooda tried to force himself into the shoes of the silent cold angry young man from the slums with an underworld acumen that was played so brilliantly by chkraverthy in Satya ...although this character can be traced back to Amitabh in films like Mukaddar ka Sikandar, Trishul etc but chakraverthy was its RGV version and so a relevant example to quote here....needless to say, Hooda failed miserably.....he would have done well if he had just played himself......Chunkey Pandey was expecting to redo "tezaab" but those days are long over....his character was damn clichÃ©d just like all others in the movie...this is an era of "Hazaro Khwahishein Aisi" when every thing has to be brilliantly and refreshingly "original"...  ..Ramu should have stopped dabbling with underworld themes immediately after "company" which was his last watchable movie and was good off course...its time he realises that movie-making is an art and you have to "think" and "create" the design every time you make a product, instead of doing it once and then letting the assembly line take care for the rest.....probably his engineering background has to do with it..
Thank God that Varma directs it himself especially when he has The Big B and soon to be the Bigger B in his movie.
You could learn a lot on how not to make a movie when you don't have anything to show.
I agree in most part with the first review especially when comparing it to other movies from the RGV production house.
In the end of the film it summarizes character as: when, where and what he will do - nobody knows.
Though it was used too much in some places when it there was no requirement for it.
Back in the 50's, when TV censorship was at its strictest, he went as far as you could go.
Last time when we saw Randeep Hooda he was in a small appearance in Monsoon Wedding.But this movie shows his potential.He resembles to Chandu of Company but definitely does it better than Vivek Oberoi.
performance wise the movie is a full of good performances CHunky Pandey gives a great performance and fits to the role.Then there are artists like Goga Kapoor Sushant Singh who can never go wrong.Isha Kopikar had very little scope but her costumes and body language was perfect for the small time when she was on screen.
In the era when Shahrukh khan's over-acting is considered 'thrilling' and rated as top-notch by the Karan Johar circus... this movie proves that this new actor has the acting skill and confidence to make these over-hyped Khans run for their money.
Venturing out into the desert alone, Porky is surprised when his camel is suddenly struck by sun-induced desert-madness.
Then, this settles into a short story of "desert madness" when the brutal sun (and I mean "brutal) knocks Porky's camel for a loop.
I do not know that I have ever seen a TV character so quick to use his fists or a gun when trouble arises.
And, when Mike Hammer beats you, he does not just knock you down or knock you out.
Women, except when evil sluts, are weaklings dominated by men.
The line between good and evil is starkly drawn, and the most complex a character (other than Mike) usually gets is when someone thought to be good turns out to be evil.
I saw this movie just by accident on TCM when I was surfing through the channels.
The word "sucks" comes to mind, but to be honest I think someone must've plugged the colonic irrigation machine into a high voltage power line when they were putting this movie together.
Brass Target is based on Frederick Nolan's book The Algonquin Project which appeared in the 1970s a period when fundamental assumptions could be called into question.
Born in 1939 to media mogul Richard Berlin and his socialite wife Honey, Brigid seemed to be on the fast track to a world of wealth and social registers--but she had a weight problem, and when mother Honey focused upon this Brigid rebelled.
The sand storm was really sick and believable and a close call for Viggo when he was running from it.
I hate it when I saw the guy who lost the race killed his horse just because his horse couldn't take it anymore!
I even get more sad when I thought Viggo is about to kill Hidalgo.
I felt you can learn something from the film.There is a very good shot of the statue of liberty when he leaves his country for the race.Laurel
I will see it again, in the movie theater, and I will buy it when available.
Hayden made a number of cheap Westerns at a time (late '50's) when Drive-in's were a booming business and in need of fare.
You know that a westernÂor any movie for that matterÂis in trouble when its title has nothing whatsoever to do with its storyline.
He rides into Del Ray and wins ownership of a saloon when its proprietor, Abbot (Fred Sherman of "The Left-Handed Gun"),cannot pay off his gambling losses.
Max is initially suspicious when Jay appears and takes sides with the downtrodden citizens, especially a crusading journalist that Kirby had earlier beaten up.
The honest citizens of Del Ray hire him as their deputy sheriff but are shocked when he refuses to let them lynch Max.
Reno knew him so short a time, he cannot be sure if he is Jay Turner when he enters the saloon.
Reno is furious when he hears the real plan later --Turner is taking him back to Monterey to die--for the murder of his partner!
She tells him when he explains his action, that what he has done is wrong, that they cannot build a life together on such a lie.
Presumably the entrance to the cave is hidden when the tide is up.
We first see Reno when he is playing cards in a saloon and winning big.
He makes a dramatic entrance in Reno's saloon and confidently pretends to be "John York" from El Paso when Reno confronts him.
This changes when a beautiful woman is transferred to work in the same NY accounting firm as Robert.
Also, when they have the "big" difficulty you can't help but feel touched.
This is a good attempt to show some of the symptoms and family issues which occur when a member develops the illness.
I believe the progression of the illness, when it occurred and the effect is had on her family was fairly accurate.
I remember being entirely taken with this film, seeing it several times when it was originally in theaters, way back in '82.
Alan Ladd, even when he wasn't acting, appeared as the sexy strong stoical silent type, and here he again fills that bill.
I also love this film because it's one of the many that carved out for Harry Andrews his reputation for playing tough-tender sergeants and sergeant majors; in 'The Red Beret' his last-words line, "Pity the man who hears the pipes and was na born in Scotland," has stuck pleasantly with me into my sixth decade; he also gives a lovely little take when the red berets are issued to him and his men and his character must part with his beloved regimental headgear.
I wish 'The Red Beret' would release on disc so that once, and many times over, in the wee hours I could snuggle down on the sofa and enjoy it as I did when I was a teenager.
I would love to relive those times when I was young and show my nephews and nieces what we use to watch as children.
Uncle Bobby was an awesome show and I watched it daily when I was young!
I do remember Bimbo the clown and those cone puppets, but the thing that always comes to mind when I think of Uncle Bobby is that magician that would come on and perform some trick - Uncle Bobby would help him out, and more often than not the trick would sort of come together and they would both kind of singsong the phrase "iiiit's maaagic"!
fail to stand out when written down; yet when combined with the delivery in the film they are poor enough to induce laughter.
There is some sword-play and many elaborate costumes are on display in the court episodes, and the early scenes showing Cagliosto's gypsy boyhood when he falls foul of the aristocrat who hangs his father and mother and sentences the boy to be whipped and blinded are strong stuff for the time.
I was 6 when this movie was made, and I just saw it today.
I was all sorts of happy when I realized it was based in NYC, although in reality, it wasn't :-( I was wondering what messed up signals I was sending to my child.
In fact the only scene that Meryl Streep was nude had nothing to do with her affair with Dr. Rice but when he came to her apartment and was startled to find her getting a rub-down from her masseur Mr. Chang, Hyon Cho; WHAT A LUCKY GUY HE IS.
I remember a couple of years ago when IFC or Sundance was running this film on an endless loop.At first I avoided it like the plague because I'd heard so many negative things like "it's boring" Or "all they do is talk"--but then I watched it anyway and saw that the great Wallace Shawn was one of the actors.How can I not watch a movie with him in it?And the other guy-I forget his name-was the evil bishop in Ladyhawke!
It's when both Andre and Wally begin to exchange opinions later in the movie, Andre did most of the talking during the first half, that the two make contact with each other and draw the audience into their conversation.
Only when Wally enters the conversation do we realize the depth and significance of this film.
I wager that if you were to record even your most passionate and eloquent conversation you would be grossly disappointed when playing it back.
Look at the various posts and see how many people remember where and when they saw it.
Its possible the director introduced these jerks to give the camera-work greater variety, but when you already have a script that is as tough and deep as this, pioneering cinematography should not be a major concern.
Even when we don't quite understand what he is saying, his obsessive eagerness to tell us something translates through his body and we are happy to listen and try to make sense of everything.
It was easier to relate to Wallace as he enters the restaurant somewhat downtrodden, listens patiently to Andre's adventures, and then seems to find his spark when he responds to Andre's tale by saying that it seemed to him that all of Andre's exploits were an effort to strip away the purpose from his life in an attempt to experience life as "pure being".
What is there when people, intellectual theater types, wouldn't go near certain plays years ago that now they go to and say "oh, that was pretty good?"
After all, these men are sophisticated individuals who have been exposed to a lot and would not bat an eye when something that might seem preposterous comes out in the conversation.
We watched about a half hour of it, and when they got to the part where Andre is talking about the blue monster with flowers growing out of its toes, I asked him if he'd seen enough.
His destiny twist suddenly when he loose his senses the evening after his own brother wedding, and waking up the morning after in a bad hospital he discovers to be paralyzed from the belly down.
A big clap to Brian Forbes light and strong where and when necessary.
It looks like things are going to get rough for Mike, especially when he has to share his room with Dunlap.
They should have shared more intimate secrets with each other, and the emotional and psychological links between the two should have been accentuated, even when they were not together in the same room.
Setting up camera equipment and recording Whirry's trysts with powerful men such as lawyer, doctors, and other prominent clientÃ¨le offers an opportunity for Kaulfield to make some easy cash, and attempts to blackmail, through Carradine, Vincent when they have him on tape screwing around with an unknown woman in a mask.
Fortunately, when the script gives her a chance, Mary Beth Hughes comes to the rescue with her animated portrait of the girl who wants to escape her small town "prison".
I wished I was 20 again when I saw this film.
I was really ashamed of being German when I saw this movie (which got so many awards).
Just when any character starts slipping into rhetoric in their thoughtful, pointed debates, their conversations suddenly turn on double meanings for their personal lives.
Non-German speakers are otherwise at a real disadvantage both for having to tear your eyes away from the charismatic actors and because few of the lyrics are translated in the subtitles, though I presume one is translated because the nostalgic lyrics for a pastoral past gain ironic resonance when the threesome ends up in a soothing sylvan Tyrollean landscape.
So we can also be surprised when "Jan" admits to having gone to the same concert she did.
Just when a baby boomer is feeling nostalgic watching these kids, the film makes the connection with the '60's explicit as it very amusingly crosses "The Big Chill" with "Ruthless People."
Somehow I had previously missed the generation gap truism: "If you're not liberal when you're under 30, you have no heart.
The conclusion goes in very surprising twists on bourgeois ethics that leave some questions about who chose to do what to whom when and who is now "a good liar."
It is refreshing to see a German political film where the context is Europe within capitalist globalism, though there are a couple of frissons of recall to the unavoidable past, as when the rich capitalist they debate comes very close to saying he's just following orders in how he's just followed the system.
Things get messy when the other young man, Jan (Daniel BrÃ¼hl) is prodded into an impulsive break-in with his friend's girl, Jule (Julie Jentsch).
The cover of night and out of the way location provide the perfect opportunity, but Dunlap misses the chance when the kid turns around and looks at him.
Everything takes place when 'Frank Nolan' (Jack Coleman) and 'Fay Perovnic' (Lindsay Frost) find themselves in a strange cafÃ© after dying on the same night and in the same river as each other.
Frank and Fay often take advantage of this ability by wishing themselves from place to place, when this occurs, or when the cafÃ© otherwise deems it important, those remaining in the dining room can watch the exploits of their companions on the (sometimes interactive) television set mounted in the far wall.
The best of which is the finale- a low key, but adorable montage involving Lucy- it comes up on us when we least suspect and is the perfect way to end a movie like this.
I was so close to cry when I saw it.
I got so touched when I watched this movie...A beautiful and a lovely movie.
You will notice when she puts her leg out the window it quickly shows no pants.
I don't care what the critics say or this bs about it being so easy to play a retarded man with "limited emotions"  Since when do mentally handicapped people have limited EMOTIONS?
when they gave the Oscar to Denzel?
I am on the verge of being a parent and the movie allows insight to the struggle we take for granted when it comes to parenthood.
These directors have never let me down: I was addicted to their work when they did Thirtysomething some 15 years ago and since then have always been amazed by their subtle touch.
In other words, he becomes incredibly capable when the plotline requires it, then appears to be quite low functioning at other times.
"You don't know what it's like when you try and you try and you try, and you never get there!")?
Notice how the scenes are technicolor when Sam is with his daughter, but have a cold, blue, almost monochrome color during the court scenes.
Penn's Oscar nomination is an example that Academy voters don't know bait when they see it.
Sean Penn plays a sweet autistic/retarded man who has somehow fathered a child (when and how and with whom?
never really explained) and Michelle Pfeiffer plays the cliched overworked, no-time-for-her-family, badly-needs-to-learn-what's-important-in-life-from-a-retarded-person career woman lawyer who is shamed into defending Penn's character in court when he is threatened with having his daughter taken away from him.
Penn and Pfeiffer surely must have thought they were earning their places in Heaven when they signed on to overact in this condescending, absurd, overwrought trash.
Sam Dawson is a mentally retarded man, who has the same capacity of a 7 year-old child..He works at a Starbucks, loves the Beatles( his favorite band) and one day has a normal daughter with a homeless woman, who abandons him and her daughter when she has the chance.
( a piano teacher who is his neighbour) But time is passing, and when Lucy reaches 7 years old she understands her father is not *normal* and intentionally tries not to be smarter than him,what makes her have problems in school.
However, when Lucy intentionally begins to hold back in school to prevent becoming smarter from her father, child protective services takes her away and Sam must fight to obtain custody.
Likewise when Sam is confused, pensive, and so on.
Sam and his friends are all a bit obsessed with the Beatles (and apparently, so were many L.A. Goal members when Nelson visited).
I'll ask her lots of personal questions: why did she get an abortion when she was 15?
I've never been to Thailand (I'm planning on studying there in the near future as an exchange student, and was searching for information on the web when this film came to my attention), but I honestly feel like I know more about the country than the filmmaker does.
He even complains when he has to pay a small "fine" to the local police who could just as easily, put him in the local jail, confiscated his equipment permanently and eventually deported him for working without the correct permits.
Had he talked to people who know Thailand he may have discovered that the hard luck stories are par for the course, and as was shown, when the subject finds they aren't going to be making any money off it, they tend to stop answering the door.
It all comes together when a man (Charles Russell) fleeing from the law for a murder hides out in a boarding house.
I do not know about the stereotypes, who believed what and when, if anyone were really the way depicted, etc.
Was most impressed with the Moses story especially the trick scene with the walking stick turning into a snake and what happened afterward when the Pharaoh initially refused Moses' request to let his people go.
While, yes, there's some stereotypes about the Negroes being such simple people (with heaven presented as a fish fry and the angels getting ten-cent cigars), there's also a message about tolerance and how, despite all that's wrong with the world, there's also plenty that's right that is made clear at the end when there's word of someone being nailed at the cross...
i first saw this movie in the mid 80's as referred by a co worker, and i scoured the TV listings for about a year until i found it, was not available locally on /through video, i thought this movie was fantastic, remember the time frame when it was made.
It seems almost incredible that this film was made in 1936, when the almost invariable tendency in Hollywood was to portray negroes as (perhaps) lovable, but mostly inept, submissive, rather primitive creatures, good for a laugh and musical entertainment but for not much else.
It really makes you wonder what caused them all to be enemies when they grew up, and it had to be more than just animal instinct.
I've since bought the tape and watch it every now-and-then when I want to smile and feel good.
I remember asking my mom about the movie when I first saw it and always remembered her response..."how do you think the little black children in the movie pictured God and others in the Bible?"
It is interesting that Sjostrom himself plays the lead and his real life wife, the love interest (although having two characters refer to her as exceptionally beautiful when she's as homely as a pig with one ear - is a bit hard to swallow).
Most silent films, damaged by the course of the time, exist in different versions with different running times, but when a DVD is released, is supposed to be in the most complete version existing (for instance, the Flicker Alley DVD of "La roue").
Its running time is only 70 minutes, when nowadays exists a 105 min.
And then, when they're cornered, Halla's sudden sacrifice of their child was inexplicable to me.
Some comments also state that Granny should be younger when the Looney Tunes were toddlers.
Columbo shows up in London without his suitcase as even when this was filmed, they lost them.
He says it is his wife's case but why he came to London without his wife when I am sure Scotland Yard would have paid for both of them?
The murder and denouement is just lame and it is surprising this episode came so early since it bears all the hallmarks of the type of episode you get when the series is going down the drain and a desperate attempt is made to liven the pattern up with a new location.
No sooner did I watch them, did I wonder what the heck I was thinking when I was a kid?
Too bad Mark is such a little girl when it comes to misbehaving.
The zenith; however, of ridiculous scenes is when Patton and family, after having just covered up what appear to be two lovebirds, see the cage rock back and forth and the birds spontaneously combust.
Also, as someone else stated, if this took place when the Looney Toons were babies, it would've been around the 1920's or 1930's at least.
This "granny" character was originally a mean old witch who protected Tweety Bird and beat Sylvester when necessary.
And when we were all teenagers we all had those teenage-sexual confused period/phases in our lives and maybe these references in the movie were only done to better capture whats going on in the mind of the life of a male teenager in Springwood, Ohio in 1985.
I thought Freddy only has power in the dream world, but since when he's able to possess human body in the real world?
The characters are poorly developed, making it hard to feel sorry for them when they are attacked by Freddy.
Of course Robert Englund is superb (when he gets chance) as Freddy Kruger and really shows an evil side towards the end.
Speaking of which Jack Sholder should be appalled by his work here, there is no real direction and when there is it really is all over the place and very bad and shows in no way the brilliance of what Wes Craven brought to the original.
The effects in this movie must have opened a few peoples eyes back when it came out because they are truly disturbing.
It was a Friday night and I had nothing to do when i saw that A Nightmare On Elm Street 2 :Freddy's Revenge was going to be on.
Very little nudity and when there is some backside scenes it is in a very traumatic situation : the gay sports teacher who is tortured and whipped in the nude of course, tied up to the showers, while the boy in the nude too is shown slightly in some darkness and flittingly.
But this can also be nothing but a tactic from Freddy to push Jesse into killing, to titillate him where it tickles and where Jesse does not really want to be tickled, though when Freddy forces Jesse away from his girlfriend at the very moment when he was getting excited enough to let himself slip into some sex can be seen as the revulsion of Freddy for that type of sex or as the fear of Jesse in front of that type of sex, which would lead to believing that Freddy managed to get back into existence through the homosexual desire of Jesse and at the same time his resistance to this sexual appeal.
We must keep in mind that this is a common situation for many boys when they turn sixteen or seventeen.
Somehow, when viewed in the wee hours of the morning, though, it almost becomes watchable.
You can't deny the fun watching Jesse Walsh shrieking like a scared little schoolgirl when he finds Freddy's glove on his hand.
The school bus at the start is also a classic and another that springs to mind is when Jesse awakes in his room to find it's become so hot that things around it like a vinyl record have begun to melt.
It all depends on whether in the end, when we see the three murders again, this is what actually happened (which would be awfully contrived and pretty bad) or whether it's another one of Ishaan's stories, made up to save himself and the other two prisoners (which would be a very interesting twist).
It does seem to happen when Chandrika helps Ishaan to escape from jail.
I also remember watching it in the hotel lobby when we had to move somewhere when i was nine or ten years old.
That's me-- i will watch any movie that comes to mind that I loved watching when I was a little kid...
Also when he tried to talk English, we could easily see that he can speak better and he was only pretending to be good.
I think when Chandrika said '3 lives in exchange for 2', it is meant to be subtle hint that a deal was cut.
May be I did miss Ishaan's reactions when I watched the movie for the first time.
The first scene when Chandrika (Juhi) meets the 3 convicts was unbelievable .
Check her out in two scenes: The first when she gently threatens the hell out of her abusive husband and the other when she tells Ishaan (Naseer's character) that she may be in love with him.
The flying scenes and visual effects in the movie were a lot of fun, especially when Nimitz crewmembers encounter Pearl Harbor-era Japanese Zero scout planes.
The decision to engage the invading force came about only when attack was imminent.
But when?
I hadn't seen this film for a long time so when it was on television recently I decided to watch it again.
I saw this movie a few times in the theater in 1980, when I was 12, and at the time it was pretty much utterly awesome.
However, as we are forced to face again and again, what is awesome when one is 12 is not the same as what is awesome when one is over 30.
It's kind of cool for a while, as you watch planes swoosh and dive, and it reminds you of the days when the prospect of going into the military meant you were going to fly cool planes and do cool things instead of simply being sent to a desert to be killed.
This one, I think, is about redressing the perceived imbalance that occurred when the US was caught unawares.
I think the first time I saw this movie was when it first made the cable circuit, I think I was seven or eight at the time.
So imagine my reaction when my father was goading me into watching another Navy movie.
Imagine if the day after President Jack Kennedy was supposed to have been assassinated, on November 23, 1963 when Captain Morrison took command of the Bonhomme Richard aircraft carrier it was really a still alive President Jack Kennedy.
Lets forget the "how" the ship got to where (or when) it was.
For instance, early on, one of the jets returning to the carrier reports trouble with its landing hook, which is supposed to grab a tether when it lands on deck.
I think that many of us have a tendency to over-analyze these types of movies, when, in fact, we should just sit back and enjoy the experience.
Time travel, moral sensibilities and harmful consequences are explored when the crew is confronted with a chance to change history.
Bilko worked (officially but not actually) for me when I was an Army officer.
But when you need lots of planes and ships, you gotta have official help.
Without a word, this talented actor's face does a comical double-take when introduced to the ship's executive officer who just happens to be black (in 1941 a black navy man could only serve as a steward in the officers mess.
Watch the first couple of minutes when Sheen is greeted by his employer's lackey and the last minutes when he debarks from the Nimitz.
I saw the film when it came out in wide-screen format and saw it several times before it left town.
It's one of those movies where when it ends, you actually feel better than when it began.
The children are great as well, when needed.
Over the years when nothing else is on I watch Bustin' Loose from time to time, it is such a good feel good movie.
However, the actor playing Nick was convincing me that this guy was a really bad actor, while when he was not in auditions was what I consider a GREAT performance.
The best scene in the movie is when Angie finds out he's been lying to her.
What had captured my attention was when I heard the name Adam Rifkin...who I had heard of, but wasn't quite familiar with.
Angie has really matured as an actress...I also like how the "angie" character was sincere and genuine, it really made me like the personality of her and want to know more about her....overall, very entertaining..surprisingly good performances when you find out afterwards it's fake (but based on someone else's story)
"Happiness is when Mifune comes up from the basement..."  I did not expect much from Mifune.
The highest rating I ever saw it receive when it was in the theaters was 3 stars, average.
They seemed to have been friends when they were younger, but Kresten had moved, and was determined to erase all traces of his family (in fact, the reason he must go home when his father dies is to make sure his brother is not harmed).
It's just that, when she gets to Kresten's and Rud's home, she does not expect to develop feelings for them (hey, they're both great guys!
They feel real when they happen, and they brought me along with their emotions.
I was really confused when I left the cinema.
And when Kresten is laying down his head in the center of the open circle in the fields, he encounters the light which his disabled brother has used as a symbol that "light" is coming from heaven.And this light of live had disabled hitherto everybody until that moment.
I guess I was just expecting something a little bit more challenging when I approached this as a Dogme film.
This made me slightly disappointed when the credits rolled.
Dogma pretends to be as close to reality as possible, but i cannot believe that in Denmark, when there is a small disagreement, everybody starts to scream at each other in such an overdone way.
Meanwhile, Claire arrives in the night without previous notice, and when she sees Liva drinking wine with Kresten, she returns to Copenhagen.
The Cleverest funny line was when the janitor is spying through the bushes in front of the window and the 2 inside say "what was that?"
making out), when weird things start to happen.
Just when you think you are in a for a predictable story with predictable characters, the film makers start to turn the world and the characters upside down and inside out.
Things start getting very weird and nightmarish when they encounter a strange scruffy man living nearby and certain actions and surroundings seem quite familiar.
Its bad when an Australian film comes out and people haven't even heard of it.
When the first clues were given I thought: "well, I've seen this beforeÂ it's another "scary movie" with a predictable endÂ" And in a certain way it is, because the main topic of the plot it's very predictable and the viewer who pays a little attention to some details soon will understand that something strange happened in the past with these guysÂ But when the plot is being reveled, it doesn't give you all the complete answersÂ There are some little details that remain unclear even after the movie ends, and I appreciate this I must say!
The pacing of the movie was perfect, even when introduced to that sudden twist and chase scene.
Some of the edge was lost when it was no longer about addiction.
The irony is that when the show dealt with genuine difficult things and touching themes, it was never sappy.
And when Tim Curry came aboard, fuggedaboudit it!
It is a resistance film, appropriate for the year 1944 when it was made.
It is a resistance film, appropriate for the year 1944 when it was made.
These so called social superiors thought themselves better than Elizabeth, however, when they forgot to bring any food supplies on their journey, she furnished them with chicken she had prepared for herself and things changed.
Nice one when your date bails on you.
The only time he seems to be telling the truth is when he is with the driver and in the '55 and that is the one time someone tells him to shut up.
And when they do talk (except for a rare, poignant moment near the end of the film when The Driver shows a hint of humanity), their conversations revolve around carburetors and such.
Or just those interactions the Driver, Mechanic, GTO and Girl have when they stop to get a bite to eat or get gas or a new part.
There is no real 'story', and whenever things look like they're about to pick up in terms of "things happening", like the scene where the GTO is pulled over by the cop and Driver to stops to give an unnecessary lie or when Girl makes the decision to ride with GTO, other things take its place to suddenly move it into just being about something else entirely.
I can't recall when I've seen a movie more badly in need of a plot.
The Driver (Taylor) and The Mechanic (Wilson) barely speak, and when they do you can be sure it's about car engines.
You know you're in the land of Deep Meaning when the characters are defined instead of named in the credit crawl.
The film is full of style and wit, basically a comment on the culture of the time when men judged each other very much the way they judged their cars.
She comes into the film unexpected and tries every way to get away and just when you think she's gone from the picture, she reappears.
One might say that the two men don't say much, but when they do it is to the point, and in fact it is what they don't say that matters.
It was released in 1971 at a time when the hopes and dreams of the '60s counter culture had given way to the disillusion of Kent State and Altamonte, the bombing of Cambodia, and the media's cynical preemption of the Hippie movement.
My main problem with "Manhattan Midnight" is that it tries too much (especially with that overbearing music score) to play like some sort of poetic tragedy, when its main character is a smug, unredeemable professional killer who doesn't mind killing innocent people (the "second" Maggie twin being an exception), and whom by the end you'll probably want to see dead as well.
I was looking through a couple of huge tables of VCDs at a store in Chinatown when I came across this film for about 2 bucks.
when its mentioned.
Going off the beaten track ...let me also take the forum to write about two things regarding Quick Draw McGraw: One, this cartoon did not promote violence and again, I was totally ticked off at the 80's parental group that ruined it for the next generation of children behind me to be able to see this....and two - in the 90's when the Arsenio Hall Show was on, I remember he came out and performed a monologue about "El-Kabbong".
It changed so many things that would have made the story link together more and I was confused at the beginning when Hannah's Auny Eva told her she looked like Chaya.
Also they could have added what I thought was a key point from the book, when her Grandpa Will is mad when he is watching the news before the dinner.
The whole part when she first went back in time was completely different...the only part that was right was that Fayge(Leah) and Shmule were getting married.
The Nazi's were at the place where they were having the wedding and the Nazi's took them when they all arrived.
I thought the movies was acted well but they could have cut out that part when they go get the picture taken and things like that.
I love it when she gets mad.
We never find out and after a night during which Rachel goes to bed drunk and has a nightmare featuring Gillian, the conflict is resolved when Rachel decides to go live with Esther and Paul and "let her mother be dead,".
Further (and most predictable) resolution occurs during the final 10 minutes when David decides to get over Gillian, move in the Paul and Esther, and start putting Rachel first.
Life ended for them when the Big Bopper died.
They hate having to pay taxes when the country's going down the pan."
The language is appalling, the attitudes indefensible, the subject matter spectacularly inappropriate, and the pair of them seem to be having a whale of a time, even when they're at each other's throats (which happens a lot).
There are times when this film just soars with emotion and ideas.
Usually when watching films, you can easily reassure yourself that everything's going to be OK, and that it's all fake anyway; or that it never happened.
I also like the soundtrack of the movie called : I Belong" by Cherie.... when Gracie was outside racing with the other girls and met his black friend.
but they should watch when old/mature enough to.
The little boys in this movie will break your heart as you can see the struggles in their eyes when they are torn between being loyal to the mother that gave birth to them, and the mother they have always known.
It is only when they move back to their mother's hometown and the introduction of their Christian grand mother that their unorthodox family situation begins to deteriorate.
Having now wasted a glorious Saturday afternoon (during Calgary Stampede week no less, when I could have been doing something REALLY enjoyable), I feel immensely cheated.
It does make you wonder what happens when you leave for the day, though.
These are characters that we're supposed to care about but I knew so little about them that when they were in danger, was so uninvolved I pondered the mechanics of the set, of the plot, of the actors' careers, etc.
What do you get when you have a movie that isn't funny enough to be called a comedy, and too boring to be called an action movie?
Then, a few years later, when technology's improved and many other movies can do the same thing but make it look more realistic, that first movie will be forgotten if there isn't a great movie behind all the effects.
Although, when the dog was taken in the beginning, shouldn't it have been dog-napped?
Makes you wonder what are dogs barking at each other when they meet in the park or is that to much spotted dogs?
Cats like the position they're in - pampered and very little required of them- why go to the trouble of taking over and running the world when it already serves you?
I may get this as a DVD when it's released!
I have gone on to use it in my own Media Studies high school class, for it is perhaps even a more relevant critique of a celebrity and "reality" obsessed screen culture today than it was when it was released in 1980.
I found as a teenager that this movie has influenced me so much I mean you can read books and everything but when you see such a terrific made movie your just speechless.
I think this is the best movie ever cause when i first saw halloweentown i totally loved it and then when i saw halloweentown 2:Kalabar's Revenge i totally loved it too.
i thought it was weird how when marnie met Luke and didn't know he was really evil so he stole aggie's spell book and used it against them.
One funny thing about this film is when that girl became Dracula and said "I'm also really thirsty".
At the end of the movie when all wrongs have been righted the Queen asks Don Juan where he will go next.He replies that he will go where most legends go,namely oblivion.I laughed at this line realising as we all should that oblivion will never provide a home for Errol Flynn.
It is sumptuous on every level, and when a first-time viewer sees that staircase, a "WOW!"
He does with a period role what Elvis did with a song he makes it his own.There may have been better swordsmen technically but no one had Flynns charisma or showmanship when it came to sword fighting.
Today's actors when you dress them in seventeenth century attire look like twenty-first century blow dried wimps dressed in costume.
And watch the fleeting expressions that cross her features when Flynn confesses his love for her -- the briefest of half-hopeful smiles followed by a scowl of indignation.
Like his swashbuckling predecessor Douglas Fairbanks, Errol Flynn tackled the part of Don Juan in his late years, he was 39 when he made this film for Warner Brothers.
Challenging the mighty Duke De Lorca, he makes his point as the loyal and devoted friend to the crown, when he declared: "Some men prefer the conquest of beauty to the conquest of a throne."
As Duke De Lorca, he was a very ambitious minister with a hand of steel... "I'm Spain!, he expressed once... His declaration remembered me Vincent Price in "The Three Musketeers," when he states, in his role of Cardinal Richelieu, "I'm France!"
Perhaps when you're an established "star", you don't have to.
Our lovable schlemiel (dolt) can always laugh at himself when things go wrong and that is why we love him.
Charley Chase made this one-reel comedy back when his screen character was still known as "Jimmie Jump," and it's not as polished as some of his later work.
One of the best gags is the very first one, when the office boy puts tacks in all the chairs and everyone sits simultaneously --and then jumps up simultaneously.
We know that when Charley is fooled with a rubber hammer that a real one will be mistaken for the fake one and that something will get broken (check!
), that when cigars are handed out they'll ultimately explode (check!
), and that when Charley receives a phone-call reporting a genuine fire the news will be regarded as a prank and thus ignored (check!).
The above got me sold on it, however when watching it a couple of other problems were quickly visible.
The viewer is intentionally kept in the dark about what the heck is going on, presumably to help ratchet up the tension, but the approach only works when the plot - what's actually happening - is fun and interesting to watch.
During a rescue scene, when time is of the essence, he takes time to change clothes.
And they're dumb enough to be playing football in the minefield just when "Our Hero" needs motivation.
It's laugh-out-loud funny, even when the kid gets shredded by a mine.
They can supposedly detect when someone approaches them, but they don't actually detonate at that point.
(I also want to know how a missions doctor can find time to do anything else at all when he's in the field managing a hospital.)
It was an ongoing mystery but the only mystery was when would the movie get good?
Utterly pointless thriller about a group of oil explorers working in the Arctic (Alaska), looking for new drill sites, when an unknown force is released and starts affecting the minds of each.
Hoffman's greatest fears is soon realized when the permafrost, that's been frozen solid for tens of thousands of years, starts to suddenly and unexpectedly thaw out.
Their might be a hint of that but when it comes down to it its about our imaginations, our superstitions and beliefs that trigger our responses to situations.
And when will film-makers finally learn; if you don't have an ending, you don't have a film... this ending is a travesty.
The next time a ghost disappears over an edit, or when a light is turned on, I'm just going to pitch the DVD out the window.
I've never really understood why the concept of environmentalism rubs so many out there the wrong way, especially when it concerns the search for oil.
We really don't know for sure what the extent of our damage will be when all is said and done.
Firstly it was about an hour into the movie before anything happened and when it did it wasn't scary.
So tell me if I have the story right........ Basically really old snow that contains the soul's of moose ghosts is melting due to global warming and when an oil company drills a hole it releases these evil moose ghosts to go around killing people and sending them crazy?
Especially when it's some sort of reject from Rocky & Bullwinkle.
Regardless of its stumbles, the film has loads of ambition to do something substantial and enduring, so even when it can't quite deliver on its promise it still beats the slew of cheap-scare horror remakes which every year become more numerous.
Starts off slow... so you think it's just taking its time, introducing you to the characters so you care when they (presumably) start to die horribly later on.
But when I sit down to watch The Lost Princess, I'm absolutely entranced, no matter how many times I have viewed it in the past.
A particularly impressive part, to me, was when Kirsten Dunst's character points to the number branded on her arm, and cries, "I wanted one of these!"
The director has an uncanny ability to capture those seemingly small and insignificant moments in a child's life which have a lasting and profound effect; those moments when everything changes, innocence is lost and nothing will ever be the same again.
The director keeps information from the audience, so that when we discover what the little girl discovers it's just as new and poignant for the viewer without being predictable.
When the Da and two kids walk on the tracks, the camera is set to a partially closed iris which intensifies the available light and colour in an otherworldly sheen--one that is gone when they return on the same tracks at night, in disappointment.
It was also frustrating because, when Dimple's character sang, I am almost certain that knowing the lyrics would have only added to the enjoyment of the film.
for example in the film she wanted a tattoo when she got one in the camp it had a completely different negative meaning.
Major disappointing swashbuckling romantic film with the great Ronald Colman playing 2 parts- a cousin who goes to Zenda to attend his cousin's coronation only to be involved when the monarch is kidnapped.
This lively, 101-minute, black and white, United Artists swashbuckler was the fourth cinematic adaptation of Anthony Hope's popular Victorian novel about dual identities and high court skullduggery when the king's scheming illegitimate half-brother tries to usurp him and claim the crown for himself.
Imagine the surprise and consternation of His Highness Duke Michael (Raymond Massey of "Desperate Journey") when the coronation proceeds as planned.
Colman and the future king get really drunk and when colman passes out, the future king drinks some drugged wine and is knocked out for several hours so he can't be named king.
David Niven and Mary Astor also star and you can find out about the plot when you watch it.
The black-and-white cinematography, by the great James Wong Howe, is atmospheric and menacing when it needs to beÂwhereas the 1952 remake looks a bit effeminate due to its quaint use of lavish Technicolor.
Anthony Hopes's classic tale turned into a classic adventure film with Ronald Coleman as the King and his commoner cousin who must masquerade as the king when he's first drugged into unconsciousness so he can't be crowned and later when the king is kidnapped.
I can't keep my eyes off of her when she is on screen.
He is considered a legendary master today and there are two completely different shots I want you to look for: the first is halfway through the story when Colman and Carroll arrive at the ball and the camera starts with them being announced and coming through a doorway.
Well, the pacing is brisk, the story engaging, acting superb and the supporting cast is dynamite--how can you fail when you are supported by the likes of the David Niven, Dougals Fairbanks, Jr. and C. Aubrey Smith?!
Sadly when he passed away in the year 2000 very few knew who he was.
The action sequence when the castle is stormed following the lowering of the draw bridge is intense.
But when he falls in love with the new queen and the real king is kidnapped by an evil half-brother, the Englishman is swept into a world of intrigue & danger he scarcely knew existed.
He had won admiration in Europe for his stunning victories over the armies of the Kingdom of Serbia in a war of 1885 (the war that was the background to Shaw's ARMS AND THE MAN), and was poised to get his crown, when the Russian Empire balked.
With such an outstanding, marquee cast that lives up to its advanced billing and then some, it is not difficult to understand why this film was such a rousing success when it premiered in 1937; so successful, in fact, that it was copied verbatim by MGM 15 years later after it purchased the rights from Selznick.
I think I kept waiting for that magic moment when all the tension, in the form at times of boredom, would break into a mad stirring of passion...or something other than boredom.
The one that really bothered me is when Salma Hyak is moving out after the wedding fiasco.
Steve starts dreaming and when he finally wakes up he is at the altar but he is unable to utter the words "I do" and passes out.
when i rented this film , i expected very little from the movie , the title seemed intriguing enough for me to rent it ...what i got was a well made film about a couple in love or maybe more about their breaking up ...it reminded me of when harry met sally at times , but must say this seems so much more close to real life .
'...one of the best scenes ** SPOILERS*** is when steve (russel crowe) gets set to leave in the middle of the night ...its funny yet at the same time it reveals an important aspect of any relationship ...the insecurity ...the insecurity of what if this wont work and the whole sequence is beautifully treated .
Color is a very bad thing when used in paint, wall paper counters and flooring.
I found the show when I had just moved into my own house and their decorating ideas have been very valuable to me.
I've always wanted to renovate my mother's bulldozed home in Kansas, the old stone house that was bulldozed when fire raged through the area and consumed the beams.
I was once in a video store, when a person I knew slightly asked me if I could recommend a film that would appeal both to him and his children.
We then see the kid on the shore and when he sees his sister he tries to flee, perhaps horrified at his sister's acting ability.
His fellow pupils are shown in the subtitles as saying "Eject, Eject" when of course they are actually shouting "Eeejit", the word Idiot in an Irish accent!.
So, naturally, I was surprised when it began to show trappings of a fantasy.
so called character actors when there is almost no character to play.
this movie is beyond belief epecially when towards the end a prostitute falls in love with wallace shawn.
There's some consolation at the end of the film when the women take arms against their captors.
Oh, and just when you thought the sociopathic film couldn't be worse, there's Nancy Kulp(Miss Jane Hathaway from the Bev Hillbillies) with a hand grenade, and Neville Brand in oriental blackface.
My very first reaction when I found out that Angelica Panganiban was to star and given the plot I thought that she was miscast due to her age.
I believe Clavell was a great historical novelist, and when he tried out the silver screen, with all its limitations, he maintained his integrity.
I'm a die hard Madonna fan...I mean literally obsessed so i've seen, heard, and read just about everything shes ever done unfortunately i wasn't able to view this film when it originally premiered because of work but thankfully i caught a late night showing of it last night on VH1 hopefully they plan on showing it again cause i'm definitely looking forward to repeat viewings...now i have to say cause its only natural that people will be comparing this movie to "Truth Or Dare" after all they do share some similarities...like they're both documentaries for a Madonna tour..oops sorry but thats where the similarities end...the person Madonna has become is nothing like the person from TOD not that she was a bad person the but her life has changed so much...she's finally experienced some success with her acting (Evita)..she's finally won Grammys(something that should have happened long ago)...shes discovered a newfound spirituality...which i think has a lot to do with the changes i observed...but most of all and most importantly the biggest difference now is that shes a mother...and wife...2 roles that i know lot of people thought she'd never play...but she is and with great success..after almost 5 years of marriage her and Guy act more like close friends than husband and wife and it is truly beautiful to see her interact with her children...even though we don't get to see too much...but i think what was most touching was seeing how more open she is about her emotions and how much kinder she is and ultimately how much happier she is...i thought this movie was beautifully done hell i think the cinematography is award worthy...and there were a couple scenes when she was talking about peace that made me get a little choked up...particularly at the end when she went to Isreal to give a speech about that very subject...well i have to say the biggest difference between the 2 films is that TOD is for fans only...IGTTYAS is one anyone can enjoy or at least learn something from whether fan or not so check your local listings and when it comes out on DVD don't just buy a copy for yourself but for everyone you know
For example-there is something fundamentally wrong with the narrative pattern which has overlapped many themes such as religion, greed and the need to be over ambitious.The good thing about this film is that it can make viewers aware of the tremendous pressure an average Filipino has to face when he or she is confronted with issues like religion and money.Juding all these facts, one can arrive at the conclusion that Santa Santita is an average film about globalization and how it has touched lives of certain individuals.
i FINALLY saw 'i'm going to tell you a secret' tonight from a copy someone had and was absolutely stunned for words when i saw it.
Her bliss faded when her father introduced her to her stepmother.
Oh man,"Hausu" is an extremely weird and grotesque horror parody.It is also supremely stylish and visually mindblowing.The plot of "House" is quite easy to describe:seven schoolgirls travel to visit grandmother at her spooky old house.It's not clear whose grandmother she is,as every character in the movie is referred to by a nickname and they all call the old woman Ojii.The house turns out to be a demon that wants to eat them and grandmother is apparently a cat.Words can't describe how positively bizarre this movie is.It plays like the cross between "Suspiria" and "Beetlejuice".There are plenty scenes of kitschy humour plus some scares for example when one of the girls tries to sneak the watermelon out,she finds a human head down the well instead.One girl is even eaten by a piano in a very gory fashion and the dead victim's fingers are still playing the piano after being bitten off.9 out of 10.
One of those once in a life-time moments, when you will laugh so hard you p*#s yourself, and then c*&p your pants from being stunned by sheer cinematic prowess.
But when they get such a lousy script to work with, what can they do?
Summer vacation is coming up, but the holiday plans of the cute teen Oshare abruptly become canceled when his father introduces his new and much younger girlfriend.
Especially for being a late 70's movie Â when the horror movies were at their most explicitly rancid and exploitative Â "Hausu" is an artistic and elegant accomplishment and it honestly deserves to be wider known, globally acclaimed and more discussed.
So now she lives in this big house all by herself (with a strange long-haired cat the girls call Snowball) and when the girls arrive, things at first seem idyllic, but then change as the girls start to meet with odd fates, one by one.
I remember exactly when I saw this movie.
I really hate bathroom humor but the proctologist in the ambulance really cracked me up when he put his finger out when being told he would have to examine a patient.
I saw this when i was 10 and i liked the movie.now as a adult i get the more adult humour.the cast list is as big as any all star cast.and most were at the height of there careers.the Stunts are first rate.if this was made now it would be fake cgi,instead of death defying stunt work.
Roger Moore spoofs his own 007 image to outrageous levels; Jamie Farr is downright hilarious as The Sheik; Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. play the perfect pair of disguised, perverted priests; and of course, this was back in the day when Farrah Fawcett was substantial eye candy.
If anything, women should find this film delightfully amusing, considering that it repeatedly mocks the whole "male machismo" angle: men obsessed with beer, women and speed that spend all of ninety minutes trying to see who is faster, who gets the girl and who has the bigger (put your own thoughts here) when all is said and done.
I was only a kid when this movie came out and it made a real impression on me.
I think when movies are rated, their intended purpose should be taken into consideration.
That's when JJ discovers Pamela Glover a very young and beautiful girl who happens to like trees.
So as there going down the road they come upon and accident where Pamela Glover is standing when JJ and Victor pull up.
In the opening sequence, about 3 1/2 minutes into the movie when the Director of Photography credit is on..
McClure is a has-been race car driver who now teams up with Victor Prinzim and his alter ego, Captain Chaos.They drive around The United States with an ambulance.They're also accompanied by the creepy doctor Nikolas Van Helsing and a blonde they call Beauty.There are many other wackos in that race, including two entertainers dressed as priests.Burt Reynolds is terrific as J.J.The great comedian Dom DeLuise, who passed away this year, is brilliant both as Victor and Captain Chaos.Farrah Fawcett, who sadly lost her struggle with cancer last summer, is a real angel as Pamela Glover, aka Beauty.Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. make a great team as the former race car driver Jamie Blake and the scam artist Morris Fenderbaum.You gotta like Roger Moore as Seymour Goldfarb, who thinks he is Roger Moore.The American football quarterback Terry Bradshaw plays Terry and country singer Mel Tillis is Mel.Bert Convy is the welthy executive who drives on a motorcycle as the other half of the newlyweds.Milton Berle's nephew Warren Berlinger sits in the back wearing a wig.There's a lot of fun stuff in this movie.You laugh every time when you see the appearance of Jack Elam.Roger Moore's James Bond routine is hilarious.You know, the guy from "The Fly Who Bugged Me".The fighting scene is a riot.It's always hilarious when Captain Chaos appears, and this time he shows them hooligans.In the end we see some bloopers.We see Dom DeLuise laughing hysterically.They sure had fun making this movie.
I remember watching Cannonball run when i was just a child, the opening sequence with the black Lamborghini simply blew me away, and i have loved that car every since.
Made back when Reynolds was hitting box office gold, "The Cannonball Run" auto race begins in Connecticut and features the goofy all-star cast passing each other up until they get to their final destination, California.
This movie is what happens when a bunch of movie stars who just happen to be close friends in real life decide to make a movie just for fun.
I respect and enjoy Miyazaki's works and I'm a bit partial to those of Tezuka Osamu, the latter because Astro Boy made quite the impression on me when I viewed its American broadcast premiere.
It tells us a whole lot about the golden age of television, of the country's torpor in the 50's, of the days when people who cared more for those dependent upon them than they did for themselves got run over by the corporate machine, and of the contrived and deliberate dumbing down of our national intellect.
The series is lighter in tone than the film but still exciting when it needs to be.
Don't switch off when the end credits start as after the credits for each episode there is a short "Tachikomatic Days" story, a little comedy sketch featuring the Tachikoma.
), and a "lacking" morality.... when further delved upon , seem to stand out to those involved [like the brightest of highway billboards] , yet seemingly and blindly passed over by most of those involved , like non-stick teflon brain tissue !
Jamie misses her mother, who committed suicide when she was a child, and her father blames himself for the death of his wife.
No clichÃ©d devices such as explosions of discordant noise to startle you when you least expect it.
I didn't exactly 'have to leave the light on' when I went to bed afterwards.
It's not that well known when great french films are discussed but this is a wonderful film, cunningly written and directed so that our expectations are constantly being changed.
The animation is brisk and flawed only when it should be for hilarity's sake, the actors are all obviously in love with their characters (that's what I get from their vocal performances) and it is even funnier for me, having been someone brought up on Spider-man and Rocket Robin Hood.
I was also young when it aired.
I have noticed in these productions that he tends to step out of character and address the audience with comments such as: "Colour and movement, that's what you need when the plot is sagging a bit".
The Swinglettes as a take off of the Andrews Sisters was superb but unfortunately it also meant that Edith was hardly distinguishable from the rest of the daughters when she has a decent part in the original score.
It is my all-time favourite feel good movie, just perfect for cheering you up when you are feeling down.
I like to have a bit of fun and colour in my life, I appreciate good singing (being trained myself) and I see no reason why I should drag my kids into Victorian times when it can travel towards us!
This is when he starts dating Archer, realizing she is someone he can settle down with and NOT just for 'fun'.
Just when you think she is only going to be a sidekick, she turns into THE kick.
Were all the Movie moguls sleeping when this Girl tried desperately to become a Star?
It was a sad departure when She took Her own life.
As Ann is to inherit everything, it's no surprise when a chandelier nearly beams her.
She does what every person in Topper's world does when they die - she contacts him to help her find out whodunnit.
And so it is that, for the next 90 minutes or so, we are in the company of a ditzy blonde (Joan Blondell who's killed off early and becomes the ghost in this case), a put-upon heiress (ill-fated Carole Landis), a mysterious masked assailant (whose identity when revealed proves quite clever), an ailing father (H.B.
Lots of support in this one for Young and Burke as the old, spooky haunted house genre serves as primary backdrop when Topper goes to the scene of the crime and then we get mixed identities, hidden panels, scores of red herrings pointing out everyone's guilt except for the killer but generously dosed with lots of amusing quips from Young, wise-cracking one-liners from Blondell in ghostly form, by-play between Burke and her maid, the underrated Patsy Kelly, and chauffeur/fraidy cat Eddie "Rochester" Anderson basically playing himself and hamming it up as only he can.
Though all three Hollywood versions of one of his best character creations leave out much of the satire they are each highly entertaining romantic comedies with many sexual innuendos considered bawdy when released in the late 30's and early 40's.
There's one scene in "Topper Returns" involving Rochester that's a gem when the raven flies to his shoulder and he gives a double take.
She was also a topnotch comedienne as she shows in this outing when she somewhat assumes the role played by Constance Bennett in the first two outings.
I believe that when it premiered in New York, in its initial 1951 American screening, Jean Simmons had already become a major International star.
Apart from the film's American title change, the print was edited drastically (and in some cases incoherently) resulting in an uneven and less enjoyable film than the one that those lucky audiences in Britain were able to see when the film had its UK premiere in 1947.
The french governess Madame de la Roughierre (played by Katrina Paxinau)was very creepy and sinister,especially when she takes Caroline on a journey of extreme deception.
The pair that later directed her in "So Long at the Fair" must have known of "Uncle Silas" when they opened their film with a similar wondrous closeup to our first encounter with her here.
I was not disappointed when the sequence that had so fascinated me as an impressionable adolescent, where the evil governess embarks with her young charge on a journey of deception, emerged as powerfully as ever after a gap of so many years.
They only carry the American released version from the early 1950's when Jean Simmons really caught on over there.
It perfectly shows "What one should avoid" when writing a script and directing a movie.
It was strange that the palace did not have electricity, but Saif came in a latest helicopter wearing Swatch watch, and traveling by Scorpio and the funny part was when Sanjay Dutt in the last scene mentions about DVD player.
Wasn't the impression given to us that the movie was based soon after independence Â when India became a Democracy?
I first saw "The Shepherd of the Hills" outdoor drama when we visited Branson for the first time, in the late 1970's.
The "Baldknobbers" were vigilantes who had done worthy things for the citizenry in the post-Civil War period, with carpetbaggers and others attempting to plunder the areas - but like a lot of such groups, when there was no further need for their good works, they turned their prodigious physical strengths to illegal, self-serving ends.
The ladies are treated as fillers when an over-intense drama has to be temporarily paused.
Specially, the scene where a thousand camels run along the train kicking up a virtual sandstorm or when Eklavya plunges the cinema hall into darkness with only his ears alert at work.
The movie goes on when even the king gets to know the guard is the father of his children.
set in a captivating palace of Rajasthan, it traces the emotional roller coaster ride of the royal palace guard Eklavya ( amitabh bachchan in a memorable performance ) who is put to the cruelest of altars in the end when he is faced with a choice between his loyalty and his son...  Saif ali khan as the son, Vidya balan and Sanjay Dutt all give beautiful performances, although the focus never really manages to shift out of the magnetic persona of Amitabh, who plays the role with such rigorous conviction that every crease in his face or every hint of a tear in his eyes more than makes up for the lack of dialogs in the movie..Eklavya is a movie of personal choices and the overly challenging task of choosing the lesser of the two wrongs, or for that matter, the better of the two rights...  barring the tortoise pace, which is not quite so bothersome as the screens blank under a couple of hours, the movie is quite worth watching for the sheer gravity of performances.
I am quite mixed in my reaction to this movie - mainly because of the baggage that the director's name carries when it comes up on screen before the feature starts.
He comes back to the fort when Rani dies.
Her comment when she reveals this person's identity, and realizes the tragedy she may have unwittingly caused, is devastating in it's simplicity and ironic truth.
THE SHEPHERD OF THE HILLS is a movie about redemption and forgiveness, and it's cast shows the difficulties faced by common people when presented with these seemingly simple acts of behavior.
Like one of the characters Eklavya from the epic Mahabharata, who cut his thumb off as a gesture of respect when his Archery teacher asks him to as fees for the teaching, this royal guard is also determined to protect his king so as to consider this job as his only Religion.
What happens when one tries to blow off the lid off these secrets?
There where times when I was actually holding my breath in awe of the sheer visual poetry that flashes across the screen.
The Big B does not really have much dialogue but his protective and watchful presence can be felt throughout the movie even when he is not in the scene.
It had an excellent blend of emotional drama & thriller; the most emotional scene was when Eklavya met Saif Ali Khan for the first time.
The best scene of the whole film was when Eklavya was blindfolded and threw his knife at a flying dove with a bell tied to its foot and managed to cut off the bell without hurting the dove, later he caught the bell before it fell into the water.
It's still a wonder why VV Chopra took so long to go behind the camera again, when he can produce such a masterstroke so effortlessly, so effectively.
Vidhu Vinod Chopra has always been the master stylist...repertoire is full of cinematic brilliance...whether it was Parinda where he showcased a underworld gangster with haunting memories...or 1947 a love story..a power house packed romantic film in the backdrop of Quit India movement...or it was Mission Kashmir where estranged son and father fought and valley burnt in their anguish...his narration has always been packed with a grip, sheer brilliance of dialog delivery, daunting back score music and use of lights and camera angles which reminds you of Guru Dutt's work...no doubt Vidhu has his traits in all his protÃ©gÃ©, be it Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Hirani or Pardeep Sarkar... so when one hears it took him five years to pen the screenplay of Eklavya, the expectations had to be high.
His desire to do something out of the ordinary is evident all through the film, but he is particularly audacious when he chooses to blank out the screen completely for a full 90 second.
Why the director should succumb to pleasing the audiences in the last 5 minutes of the film, when he has defiantly stood against it in first 100 - I just don't understand.
In this film he is effectively restrained, even in the scene when the real twist in the tale comes in.
But when they get there, they will see the things are not like they wish!
Some of the scenes are exceptional; when Daniel Howitt is cashing a never seen before cheque, when Granny Becky has her eyes uncovered after an operation, when Young Matt talks about how love is so complicated, when Daniel Howitt takes possession of the old house in Moaning Meadow, when Aunt Mollie cremates her dead son and herself, when Pete the mute brother is discovered in a stream of light pouring through a window trying to catch dust motes.
What do you expect when you watch a movie with a name like this.
Well it was pretty lame when it tried to be funny, but it actually had an excellent story if you can believe it.
I'm not saying there shouldn't have been any, I understood there was going to be quite a lot, it being a bachelor party and all, but you know it's gone too far when you begin to feel uncomfortable watching it by yourself.
But when watching this movie look out for the character Eli, played by the talented actor Aaron Himelstein, he's the one that makes you laugh and the majority of the funny jokes come from him and his awesome nervous character.
This is a movie that I would have probably enjoyed a lot more if I hadn't of read all of the terrible reviews, simple because no movie can be enjoyed when you know the bad bits that people have found.
So ignore the bad reviews, and try and forget about them when you watch this movie, because it really isn't that bad, it makes you laugh and smile and has a good story and good actors, which is all I wanted from it.
Just when you think the movie can not get any worse it surprises and it does.
Scott Bakula ... ah ... he just gets better and more seasoned with every new role he takes on: compassionate and kind, but stern and demanding when needed.
I honestly didn't think I'd like Matthew Settle as Bo, but he convinced me with his scene in the backyard when he *finally* got to meet his dream girl.
I saw this movie when I was about 9 and couldn't really sit through to the end because it scared me so.
Tony Todd is excellent as The Candyman, and his deep voice is great when he is talking, it is menacing and he just sounds evil.
The idea of a killer coming when you call him is very interesting because it is different from what we have seen before.
However, one of the duo starts to put a bit too much effort into the work, and ends up coming a cropper when Candyman decides to have his wicked way with her.
For example, when 'Mr.
In fact, I have to do an essay on a foreign film and chose to do this one ... problem is - I can't find too much info about it ... but, I feel that this film is great for first-time foreign movie-goers as they seem a bit hesitant at first when faced with watching a foreign movie - especially students ... because of "The Assassin" I feel that the comparison between the 2 movies will help other countries gain a greater understanding for foreign movies... it's a must see!
Grad students Helen and Bernie are gathering information for their masters thesis concerning urban legends when Helen runs across the tale of Candyman, a demon who can be conjured by saying his name five times in front of a mirror.
Virginia Madsen as Helen is beautiful and tragic and also damn scary when she wants to be.
or, "Why does the hook make Helen come back when it is not what made Candyman come back?"
The educated Candyman was an artist, but when the daughter of a powerful man got pregnant of him, her father hired some hooligans that saw off his right hand with a rusty blade, took him to an apiary with dozens of hives with hungry bees, smashed the hives and smeared honeycomb in his naked body.
I was only about six or seven when I first heard the terrifying "Bloody Mary" legend, which was similar to the Candyman legend.
I used to believe in these legends - when I was kid - but as I grew older, I realized that they're just legends and therefore aren't meant to be taken literally.
But when she is falsely accused of several brutal murders, could the Candyman be out for revenge, because she doubted him?
Candyman is excellent because it is a film that I genuinely found very twisted and disturbing when I saw it at the tender age of 15.
So when Helen decides that the Candyman is actually a local drug dealer hiding behind the Candyman identity.
It is genuinely scary, and it makes one have second thoughts when standing in front of a mirror.
Philip Glass' quasi-religious score consistently provides an eerie companion when the camera takes us into seemingly normal locations, like a public restroom for instance.
But, when you have a winning combination of elegance and disgust in a verbose, cultured villain, why alter it too much?
The only real major gripe I had was the pacing could get rather sluggish, but director Boris Segal's accessible direction delivered the goods when it came to the action set-pieces, filming the exteriors with its available scope and generating some surprises.
But when it turns dark outside... there's a group of cultists who called themselves "The Family" (Led by Anthony Zerbe), who got affected by the plague.
So naturally, when he meets a group of survivors they are children.
Years later when we learned more about Chuck's far-right politics, did the scene give off a different vibe.
Or more importantly, when will the ticket buying audience...
As a child I always liked the music, particularly the "surprise party" theme that plays when the villains make their first appearance.
That had been tried, to a point, in "House of Dracula," when the scientist isolated a microorganism that had "infected" Dracula.
Well, probably not, but certainly the most influential on my life back in the mid 70s when I first caught it on British television.
I cried and cried when Neville died.
Even now when I watch the film, the bleak feeling which runs as an undercurrent throughout, never ceases to move me with the tragedy of the ending.
I really believe that the films you see when you are between 12 and 16 remain with you forever, because its the most impressionable time of your life.
A good movie, with a sad, yet hope-filled happy ending, this film is yet another feather-in-the-cap for Charlton Heston when he was in his sci-fi movie making period (Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green) in his great career, and this particular "social statement" movie of the 70's remains relevant to this day.
In my opinion, it is one of the best Apocalyptic Sci-Fi movies of the 70's (together with 'Soylent Green'), when the world had the cold war to threaten and the population had a great fear of a biological weapons.
After spending a long time searching for this movie, I finally found a store that had it on VHS for less than $1, and I immediately popped it in my VCR when I got home.
After reading about the plot I was hooked right away: In the future, kick-boxing has been overtaken by cryogenically enhanced fighters, only one man is still 100% human, but when he refuses to fight in the ultimate lethal tournament, the arrangers kidnap his girlfriend/manager and force him to compete!
It is a film that myself and my friends talk about to this day despite the fact that most of my friends only saw it once or twice (when forced by me).
The filmmakers obviously were trying for that supremely nasty moment in JEEPERS CREEPERS when the Creeper is found gnawing on the limb of an inmate.
OK fine.. then he starts summoning, OK... not bad, then it drags out into a non-demon, shapeshifter that gets stronger when it eats flesh, yet still part of some occult plot according to our on-screen expert, some jailhouse nutbag that suddenly offers all of the 'dirt' to shovel into all the plot-holes.
My wife asked me why I wanted to rent it and I said you never know when you'll find something pretty good ... which is almost never.
Essentially, we are to believe that six convicts when left alone with a young hottie guard aren't going to gang rape her or try to escape, but are going to listen to her stupid directions that proceed to get nearly all of them killed.
But what's different is that you're never really sure when the beast is going to be monster and when it's going to be human.
The horns, the four fingered hands, the nasty teeth - it's particularly effective when he gets good and bloodied up.
I have no idea what the cast and crew were smoking when they made this hideous picture.
On the other hand, the plethora of characters and occasional narrative incoherence can make it difficult at times to understand what exactly is going on, particularly when the story takes a decidedly metaphysical turn (with imagery taken straight out of "Contact") in the final half hour.
Quaid seems to make an attempt but MacDowell never does give her husband any softness except during the final scene when she asks him to talk to her.
Excellent portrayal of two couples as best friends - you can notice the comfortable interaction between the couples in the present vs their interaction and awkwardness when they were getting to know each other.
Kudos for the fact that the sympathetic characters in the movie (played by Quaid and McDowell) were actually suggesting that marriage problems need to be fought through and marriage held on to rather than thrown away, but still, frankly, I thought this thing would never end, and the ending, when it finally did arrive, was entirely forgettable.
I was pleased when I found this Kinnear/Quaid movie on the Sundance channel, but that didn't last long.
Later, when Kinnear tells Quaid about great sex, Quaid's character asks whether they ever talk.
There are unexpected comedy elements as well, for example, when a post-meltdown Beth blows her nose in the expensive placemat Karen bought for her in Italy.
I expect others feel the same when watching it.
There were times when I just wanted to get up and lose myself in the WWW of my computer, but I had to see this movie out.
At the end of it all, you know the film succeeded when it creates discussions and heated debates with your partner.
Particularly the realization that when a marriage evolves into one dealing with day-to-day responsibilities of bringing up children and the daily business of our lives, the marriage seems to suffer.... but, the difference between the two couples is that one decides to stay together and cope with the realities of life, while the other couple looks elsewhere to recapture the adventurous feelings of new love with a new partner.
It is an interesting look as the bond of marriage, and its complexities when its all said and done.
Dinner With Friends is perhaps one of the best written plays about marriage & the reaction of one couple when there best friends split up.
I happen to be someone who does like to watch the credits roll in when a movie ends.
I know it's one of those silliest things a person can do after watching a movie but then when I saw the final credit, it's a made-for-TV movie from HBO.
The way Tom questioned his wife over whatever happened at Gabe and Karen's house when she was there with the kids was a little, kind of scary.
Sometimes, the lines are not always being drawn clearly when it come to the marriage of someone you know or maybe your own's when something starts to happen.
Having seen Donald Margulies' play when it opened in New York, I was interested in what Norman Jewison, the director, had done with it for the screen version.
How do we react when our closest friends question the unspoken foundations of our lives?
It was a nice try, I bet they all cared deeply about this serious subject, but when the lead can't lead, or even follow, he should stay out of the way.
I found myself walking away from the theater feeling better than I ever felt when exiting the film .
The weird part was years later when I'd try to explain the plot to someone.
A huge still from this film on a book of my father's on Epic movies had long intrigued me but when I had tried to watch it one afternoon several years ago (almost to the day) on Italian TV, I was put off by its utter daftness.
but more in the end when black lets white been taken by the cops its really starts showing the symbolic meaning of them representing yin and yang, the first example i can give is white talking about that both lost most of there screws but he keeping them all.
my second example is near the end when black meets the minotaur and learning that it is the darkness in himself, with a inner journey he learns that the minotaur wants to let black use all his "dark" powers in the meantime white is freaking out because slowly the darkness (yang) is winning.
I seen the mini series when aired on British TV and i enjoyed it very much.
I was searching in the inter net when suddenly I saw it and then your website came up, so I decided to log in and sign in as a member.
the past few years i have tried to get a copy of it with out much luck till recently, it cost me a lot but it will always take pride of place in my movie collection.I think the combination of Sam Neil and Peter Strauss was in part the making of this mini series, they are both fine actors and played their parts to perfection, my partner would not have even considered watching something like this normally but sat through it because i had raved about it for so long and when it had finished he had tears in his eyes and said DAM BRILLIANT,he enjoyed it, and was glad that he had taken the time to watch it.
The murder mystery FOOTSTEPS IN THE DARK, the all star romp THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS, and the interesting French war drama UNCERTAIN GLORY were exceptions   I suspect this treatment began to bug Flynn after the rape case in 1944, when Warner's was determined (for damage control) to try to retain Flynn's hero image at all costs, and to make his sexuality a type of joke.
Instead of just being a stuffed - shirt solicitor and art collector, Porter showed the demons that drive Soames to the mad act that blights his home life (Soames sexually attacks an unwilling Irene - his wife - when she refused to fulfill her wifely duties).
He was only 50 when he died from a debauched lifestyle.
Timothy Hutton gets the right tone when Archie is dealing with his exacting boss, and it doesn't seem at all odd that this smart aleck would be loyal to a man who routinely tells him where to sit.
The fort siege sequences and the storming of the breech are awful when compared to Sharpe's Company, and that was supposedly on a much smaller budget!
There is a great deal of violence within the film (which while in my eyes completely justifies the progression of the film is incredibly misleading when you look at the UK Film Certificate Branding of a mere 12) as the battles waged become more intense, more bloody and more important to the survival of our two heroes.
And the mistakes he constantly makes- why in hell does he actually give his real name when acting as a spy?
How Sharpe after one beating after another managed to shrug it off when my back puts me out is another stretch of believability.
I liked the flashback to Sharpe's Triumph when Sharpe was almost killed by Dodd, but the idea that Dodd would have been allowed to live for 14 years is just ridiculous.
Sharpe responds as any experienced ex-soldier would when called back to the colors...he declines.
The Rajah, the regent and Dodd all approve of the old ways when dealing with traitors, captured soldiers, thieves and other malefactors.
I still miss the late Sergeant Obadiah Hakeswell, leering and repellent, who liked to talk into his hat when not trying to shoot Sharpe in the back.
Bickerstaff is a mouth breather, a leering bully, a resentful opportunist, a man who probably last saw a bar of soap when he last brushed his rotting teeth.
He's not so much unhinged as he is utterly logical when it comes to protecting his self-interest and justifying his resentments.
i wish they'd make another series out of it.it was very good if you watch it you will not be wasting your time.full of adventure action and fun.it will have to be bought when it comes out on DVD.the bad guy was ever so slightly insane.on to pickersmith wasn't he awful?
the french having honour i would never have thought it after the first lot.man singing at the end was so cool it brought so many memoires from the last episode when they were at waterloo.long live sharpe the french couldn't kill neither will any one else.
India, as well as its inhabitants, shimmers; however, the director Tom Clegg would have done well to ignore the peremptory entreaties of Indian/American actress (using the term advisedly, of course) Padma Lakshmi, when she demanded to be cast as the scheming courtesan, Madhuvanthi.
The trouble comes when there's too many Yakuza characters given too much back story, too much over inflated psychodrama with Black attempting to rid himself of his solitary monster like Minetaur persona (this time a Greek myth of the bull monster locked in the labyrinth), and not enough explanation of who the mysterious villain was, who were his henchmen refereed to as both "killing machines" and "aliens" more than once, and what if any connection did he have to re-developing the town, killing the kids, his mission from God, and the mysterious organization who lent him the monsters?
Enjoyable and unique anime, but like so many it reaches for seriousness, when whimsy would be a better fit.
Having infiltrated the enemy, and unrecognised by Dodd, Sharpe has to prove his new found loyalty to the young maharajah when he is ordered by the Colonel to shoot his best friend...
Notice how many things weren't in the room when Joe would use the Key, as compared to what appeared in the room through the photograph.
did he really die or did he return to his place of origin when he died?
It is the city itself that rules the film, and these passionate animators do not disappoint when it comes to delivering scene after scene showcasing an unfathomable detail rendered in these massive, severely inspired cityscapes.
I was surprised when I checked the credits of this miniseries to see that it had not been based on a book.
I remember when the soporific Taken was put on how it was all but impossible to know when the show was on, or even the boring Triangle.
I expected higher profile roles for him after SFU died, and when I saw he signed on for Lost Room, I was disappointed.
This year, both Tekkonkinkreet and the highly acclaimed 5 Centimeters Per Second were sold out in days when tickets when on sale, and it's a pity I may not be able to catch the latter due to conflict in schedules.
I was never quite sure if I should trust her completely or not since the objects seem to prove that power corrupts even when you have what you think are the best interests at heart.
A must own on DVD when it finally comes out.
You have to only guess what is coming next, and when it comes, something else is brought into the fold which skews or distorts what you first believed.
I saw this movie as I had seen a good review from IMDb itself....moreover I was compelled to see this film as Dakota Fanning was in this movie........even though Kurt Russell was in this movie..........I expected it to be her movie and it was..........She is an amazing talent whom we had seen in I am sam,Hide and seek,war of the worlds,push,winged creatures............without much effort she delivers the beautiful performances and it makes me wonder..............The story has inspired me and has made me realise that to achieve anything we must believe.............even when odds are against us..............this film brings out true value of relationship and will to uphold the most thing in which you believe.................
This is the level of film quality that we expect when we pay full price for a movie ticket.
Made me remember what it was like to be a kid, when everything was possible.
I fell in-love with this movie from beginning to end,the first time i watched it i closed my eyes in the beginning when i saw the horse "Sonador" fall,i cried through this whole movie and at the same time,had a wonderful smile on my face..Dakota fanning is just wonderful, all of my favorite actors in this movie, i wish it could have been longer and shown more of "Sonador's" recovery etc,,but the last 10minutes,the last part of the race i could feel the uplifting experience of "Sonador"across the finishing line,a baby could watch this it is just that compatible for families.this movie deserves an academy..so needless to say whenever it comes on,and i have also taped it, i have to watch it again and again.just to see the bad guys in it,if there are such things in this,loose...I fell in-love with the sheik when he spoke to Dakota about her horse winning,i would have loved to have seen them all sitting together tho at the races.the sheik the cranes and the wonderful Spanish horsey handler..it did my heart so good to see the Prince,stand up and acknowledge "Cale" and "sonador" in the winners circle...thanks for letting me express these feelings..god bless to all.
We will buy the DVD when it comes out.
Elizabeth Shue is seen as a mother who has to work to help meet ends when her husband loses his job.
Dakota Fanning is a fantastic actor, and she plays the part of Cale Crane beautifully, only once (when Dreamer is reclaimed by her father as a surprise) striking a false note of over-enthusiastic cheesiness.
Despite the very economical story-telling (the movie almost felt too short and rushed from one scene to another), the story captured many of the fabulous quirks of horse-racing in Kentucky (not least the reference to the Saudi prince who flies his private 737 to Lexington to see his horse run against his brother's horse--the *real* sheik of Dubai has flown his 737 into Lexington for years, where he parks it on the tarmac at the airport across Versailles road from Keeneland...everyone *knows* when the sheik is in town to see or buy his horses).
Everyone in the theater clapped and cheered when Cale's horse Sonador, crossed the finish line in first place at the Breeder's Cup.
If you have any ability to follow how these types of movies go, then you will know the outcome long before it happens... it doesn't matter because you'll be wanting that outcome and you'll embrace it when it happens!!!
There is some spectacular scenery in here, much of it in Kentucky and where better to be when filming a horse racing story?
I would not call this a gripping suspense movie since there are some places that make you laugh when maybe you should not.
I was thinking it might have some connection to the Cannonball Run movies when I first saw it come on, but it doesn't.
It's particularly hilarious when the German driver gets blown up, and five minutes later someone is reading a newspaper with his death as the headline.
However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred.
It was funny when Jamie(Lindsay Wagner) threw Steve(Lee Majors) out the window.
But the excitement factor was better when Steve landed on the car giving Jamie a chance to escape, while Steve flipped the car, and the car took off after being flipped.
Actually, when deciding which short is the worst, you have to choose between HALF-SHOT SHOOTERS and THREE PESTS IN A MESS.
Just a trivia ÂThere were 9 Turkish ladies who had come to see this movie and I think this was also the first movie of my life when I was the only male in the audience.
This Franco-Italian "Eastern Western" has intrigued me since I read about it on a magazine, in view of its then-upcoming showing on Italian TV, when I was about 7 years old Â but it literally seemed to vanish from the face of the earth in the interim!
Given that fact and Leonard Maltin's unpromising ** rating, I had suspected that it was going to be a big disappointment when I eventually catch up with it Â but, happily, it turned out not to be the case.
Spanish actress MÃ³nica Randall also gave us a skintastic display when in bed with Mifune.
It is very odd to hear him speak english...especially when he never really learned it in the first place!
There's many great little bits in the movie like when Link is trying to escape from Kuroda...he just can't get away from him.
What you get is a very bad movie that isn't funny or scary which is exactly what one would expect when combining characters from other movies that are also not funny or scary.
I don't mean to demean Vengo when I say it's use of music is more like that in Forrest Gump or Almost Famous where music sets the mood or anchors us in a time and place as the story flows.
If you didn't when you started watching, you will by the end.
Like when a hobo riding a tricycle hits a box and falls off.
When TV was in it's infancy, material like this was readily available on the Ed Sullivan show, the Jackie Gleason show, and many other classic programs, and for those of us who grew up watching TV in an era when they would only broadcast for about 12 hours per day because there was not enough material available to fill an entire 24-hour schedule, then you will be very happy to see this type of stuff once again.
I saw this movie when it came out in 1987, but it was released under the original title, "Love is a Dog From Hell."
The screenplay makes Voss a sympathetic and human character, even when he engages in necrophilia at the end.
Until the end when he finally finds somebody who accepts him.
The first period is situated in the 1950's, when Harry Vos is still a young kid.
An older friend learns him everything there is to know about how to approach a girl and what to do when his method doesn't work.
And when you know that he has committed necrophilia, those feelings of disgust only increase.
The first act is set in 1955 and follows Harry when he's twelve years old.
He is struck by his first notions of true love when he sees a dream-like film in cinema, only to be helped out of his dream by a more mature friend who claims the only reason people get married is to get laid.
In the third act we get a more literal adaptation of Bukowsky's THE COPULATING MERMAID OF VENICE, CA., when Harry is a down-on-his-luck alcoholic, devoid of any aspirations, spending most of his time in shady bars.
Most Italian directors put no effort in making their products available to foreigners, and even when they do, you still see a different movie if you're from here.
I just saw it again tonight, though I remember seeing it a couple times when I was a kid--and even back then I was amazed at Steve McGarrett's awesomeness.
I used to hang with Kevin Rapp, when he was making this film.
This is one of those rare times when almost all of the great martial arts actors from the 70s are in the same flick.
Very rarely do I encounter a Kung Fu film where I find myself confused when the ending comes, and this is exactly where I found myself at the end of Ten Tigers of Kwangtung.
I quickly grew bored at the beginning of the film when it seemed as if it was going to be nothing more than one blood bath after the other, although I did think some of Izo's enemies were quite creative.
His presence is ignored in the movie until the end when he gives Izo an order to "punish them" as he points to the ultimate hierarchy which Izo has been hunting.
From an instant when people heard that some people sing in it they left it behind and didn't wanted too see it although it was directed by Lars Von Trier.
In the scene where he kills his own mother is also an symbolic example, his mother says "killing me is like killing yourself Izo", when a population corrupts and destroy there country they destroy there own system...they destroy themselves.
Well everybody knows what we are expecting when we see a Miike film.
Nikita Taylor is not a good girl.She's a heroin addict who participates in robbing the pharmacy.It ends up badly and she's the only survivor.She's sentenced for life for shooting a policeman.But one day she finds out Nikita no longer exists and she has to work as an assassin.Things get more complicated when she falls in love with a cashier.Nikita is an action thriller directed by Luc Besson.In 1993 John Badham made an English version called Point of No Return with Bridget Fobda in the lead.In the French version Anne Parillaud does a great job as Nikita.Jean-Hugues Anglade is terrific as her boyfriend Marco.TchÃ©ky Karyo is brilliant as Bob.Jeanne Moreau is wonderful as Amande.Jean Reno is fantastic as Victor the cleaner.We all remember his outstanding performance also as a cleaner in Leon (1994), a Luc Besson masterpiece.The restaurant sequence looks quite awesome.She has to make her first assassination on her birthday.And the job she does with Victor, and he wastes all those bullets on those men and gets shot.I wish Luc Besson could come up with stuff like this some day again.Nikita is a great representative of the action genre.
The story itself is pretty amazing, intelligent, but not necessarily original or as weird as people are saying when you understand it.
I'm sick of movies (such as Donnie Darko and Oldboy) that think they're so utterly intelligent when in reality they just rehash old clichÃ©s that have been done in movies exactly just like them time and time again.
We begin when the Shogunate is on its last legs, but still capable of punishing its enemies.
Therefore, when people sit down to watch one of his films, surely it is a given that it is not going to be an easy ride?
I for one, found this much less tedious than LOTR - is two hours really that long when compared with Peter Jackson's slow-mo fantasy epic??
Takeshi is pretty much flawless in his film choices, so you should already know this will be good when you see his name (not to mention it's a Takeshi Miike film, which is great).
And he is the barbarism of which the human animal is capable when running unchecked and uncontrolled; unrestrained.
He represents these aspects of the human spirit up through history, and must finally end his existence when man has attained the purity to cast off oppression for good and eradicate his own barbaric tendencies through moral discipline and self-control.
My friends and I have different views on what to trust in a guy and when we think it is time to run.
The characters are very believable in each situation, and my favorite scene is when the black woman starts yelling in the parking lot - she is absolutely hysterical!!
I hid my eyes when their faces appeared on screen.
And I am thrilled when I see people with outstanding, almost unearthly psychomotor skills exercise them, whether on the football field or the dance floor.
The set takes on color when Candela dances the Fire Dance, and again at the end when Lucia sacrifices herself to be the eternal lover of the bewitching ghost of Jose, thus setting Candela free from his cursed memory.
u will hope the best moments will never end, when your hands were grasped by your lover and when you sleep so safely in your lover's arms.
I don't think Palace rewrites the book at all when it comes to its medium, genre or format, but I think it's a fun ride.
But it all changed when the current Crown Prince of the royal family 19-year-old Lee Shin is attending the school, leaving the school all in a buzz of excitement.
However her finest moment is in the rice field , in the rain, when she is raped(seduced) by the leacherous Walter (Gassmann) her reaction to that moment is incredible!!
The verrismo genre was new at the time; in 2000 it doesn't have the same impact that it did when Open City, Bicycle Thief, La Strada, et al were all showing at about the same time, and showing us that there was a true, artistic alternative to Hollywood pap.
With absolutely no training, this former beauty queen and film extra had the luck to resemble Ingrid Bergman when Bergman was Hollywood's #1 star.
It's an amazing performance, especially when you consider she was 18 at the time!!
In 1995 when I first encountered this movie I also desperately wanted to believe every last bit of nonsense hurled at the viewer like a face full of compressed cheeze.
One thing you have to keep in mind when thinking about paranormal phenomenon is that eye witnesses are statistically unreliable: You can't reproduce what they claim to have seen, and their stories tend to change over time.
One could argue that he was simply remembering more detail as time went on, but the fact remains that when you look at the reports and evidence collected in 1947 it sounds a lot less sexy than what was being remembered thirty, forty, and fifty years later.
At the reunion is retired Maj. Jesse Marcel,Kyle MacLachian, who was the intelligence officer of that bomber wing back in 1947 when the Roswell crash happened.
Not much artistic license taken, which when dealing with something based in fact, is much appreciated.
But when it comes to what is important: The Roswell Incident, this movie is accurate with what eye witnesses have been saying for years.
Unfortunately, as an actor, Claire Brennan was as talented as she was attractive, and when she expresses her disgust she does so with a smile that she holds back with painful difficulty.
They are very attractive women, and just when you think they might drop their top and save this film fiasco, they don't.
The film does not contain much dialogue but it's pretty bad when it occurs with male characters saying things like "you got yourself a great little broad there" after Jade has just served the drinks!
She Freak also makes the fatal mistake of being utterly boring throughout, I mean this is the kind of film that depicts a romance between two people by having them sitting on a park bench together, nothing happens of any note until the last five minutes when the 'twist' ending is revealed which you can probably guess anyway from the opening scene.
I was so relieved when he made it back home safely and married her.
It is an acurate depiction of their lifestyle in the 1950's (did you realize that when you wrote this?).
They didn't always want that contact anyway, as observed when the Austrailian yacht came looking to trade booze for women and the people were desperately begged their own children to not go with them.
It pulled him through when he didn't know how to heal a seemingly dead child or make it to land after losing his ship in the middle of the ocean.
It was hilarious when Alicia tied herself up then locking herself in the trunk.
One notable exception in the movie was when he was sinking in the water after they jumped form the boat in the storm, and it seemed that a hand came and pulled him up, but no one was there.
(you'll see what I mean afterwords, when you will see what you payed for) If you're a patient man/woman and you think that you can get past the "propagandistic" content, it's a well made film, I think, and if you really have nothing else to do, you might want to pirate it a-harrrr.Just kidding...never do something illegal...even in this case...watch it, and you'll see why (it's bad to do something illegal).Anyway, I hope I didn't bore you with this long review...If you will consider watching it, you will find that you do have your limits as patience is concerned...just don't pay too much for it.
You get a light-hearted view of one young man's experience in a remote and unusual part of the world, at a time when the world was just about to start shrinking.
The Other Side of Heaven was a refreshing change and is proof that Hollywood can do it when they want to.
This short is pretty darn funny all on its own when viewed today, although the MST3k treatment definitely bumps it to a 10.
It is not to be missed and everyone should be checking HBO to see when it plays next.
We remember that man either because he took away from this world a chunk of our moral fiber, the scars forever etched in our minds, or probably because he gave this world freedom from the ideologies of mankind's vilest prodigy when he hanged himself.
And just when we thought that we knew too much to burden our consciences, comes a movie about this small group of men who disappeared off the face of the earth because of something that disturbs, intrigues and thwarts us till this day: Love, and all the stigma it carries.
Not at a time when your first-duty towards the people you love was replaced by the pride of the country.
How can one understand the true horror when it is glossed over.
It's touching, but it's no less strong when I dwelled on the contrasts.
The golden days of decadent Berlin came to a bloody halt when Hitler's regime took over Germany in the early 1930s and gay men were brought down by simple innuendo and gossip (lesbianism was considered curable, but male homosexuality was "catching").
The big thing about this movie is to get to know about what happened in that time, because no one spoke about this when we were talking about the second world war in history class.
Rugged Robert (hunky Barry Prima), snippy Rita (homely eyesore Enny Haryono), and nerdy Tommy (bespectacled beanpole dweeb Johann Mardjono) are a trio of eager young college students who along with their macho guide Bisma (chunky bearded wonder Rukman Herman) find themselves in deep trouble when they encounter a lethal tribe of primitive cannibals deep in the jungle.
Later, Allen realizes that Madison was the little girl mermaid that rescued him when he was a young boy in the film's opening flashback sequence.
Much of the movie's humor derives from Allen's brother Freddie's (John Candy) goof-ball antics - namely when he drops coins and later speaks Swedish - and nerdy scientist Walter Kornbluth's (Eugene Levy) chronic bad luck.
Another great scene is when the mermaid identifies her sea name before choosing Madison.
But when he gets into trouble, he is rescued by the same one.
It stars a young Tom Hanks, before his success as an actor, at a time when he was doing mostly comedy.
When she is out of water, she is human (with legs) and when she is wet, she becomes a mermaid.
It may be a funny line, but we should also be able to identify with Allen's pain when he tries to come to terms with the fact that his love match is a... fish.
It moves me and it takes me back to a time when things where simple and a good story could be told without the bells and whistles and still move you years after.
If you were a kid like I was when this film first came out.
Only at the last moment, on the dockside, when she has won him over and he has cravenly agreed to join her in her oceanic world, does she spring on him the deadly caveat that there will be no going back; when he joins her, it is for ever.
Could it be the same mermaid that saved him when he was a boy?
-- The mermaid has normal legs when kept dry, but once splashed with water, the legs turn into fish fins.
I used to watch this movie as a kid and occasionally when I was in my teens but I watched it again now (im 24) and I must say its an excellent movie, which also has a very good story line, and one you can relate to if you have been in a relationship where your asking yourself many questions about the person your with and things that do which don't make sense!
Like so many players when the motion picture studios started cutting down production and leaving people out of work, Davis turned to television.
So when Joan Davis debuted I Married Joan in 1952 she was accused of copying Lucy.
Worse, this scenario is far too neat and tidy--and when the actors aren't being overly 'cute', they're screaming senselessly at each other.
Her mom left her when she was a child & because of this she has a romanticized notion of her mother & a deep fear of abandonment.
Before Tony Hawk - There was Gator..... Or should I say , when Tony Hawk was a newbie - Gator was pro.
Right about the time they're talking about Gator punching the cop and showing pictures of him skating when he was a teen, a really awesome punk song is playing in the background and I have no idea who it is.
With Gator as the focus, viewers get a back-story of when Extreme Sports was in its in infancy.
This time around its the girl who cried wolf when Vincent, (the very funny Benicio), ends up stealing a car with her in it.
All hell breaks loose when good old Uncle Raymond, (Walken in his usual style of acting), comes on the scene in search of the two.
'Porky's Romance' is a great and handsome piece of work in which Porky goes through an emotional roller coaster which even includes a suicide attempt when his proposal to Petunia is turned down.
That title was snatched from her just two cartoons after 'Porky's Romance' when Tex Avery's 'Porky's Duck Hunt' introduced a certain little black duck with a penchant for scene-stealing.
At first I was sad and really felt the depression when sweet little Porky's heart is broken.
Perhaps the sweetest moment in cartoon/film history is when Porky goes to see his dream girl and she laughs at him.
The only funny part of this entire cartoon, frankly, was the very end when Porky gives his two cents to the dog, too.
I ended up sitting through a snore fest, and I can't even tell you what it was about because my attention span stops after 5 minutes when there isn't a violent murder.
In this movie, Paris is basically a typical Third World nation in microcosm: You have a charismatic dictator (the Mayor) surrounded by yes-men and flunkies, an economy that has no real industry as such and forced to take "foreign aid" any way it can, a populace who is so dependent on the dictator's policies that it will support them whatever the moral cost--and not challenge him when times go bad, and the army (the kids with the hot rod cars) who do the dirty work but don't share the benefits and have no future.
The protagonist comes to Paris as a refugee, accepts the situation, and witnesses the chaos when the moral cost of the Mayor's racket hits a tipping point and people start voting with their gas pedals.
The monsters in this movie are the ones we breed in our own societies when those in power do what they want (even if they believe it is for the greater good) and enact unethical policies.
Strangely there some offbeat things going on in Paris and when the traumatised Arthur tries to leave he realises that he's trapped in this hell of a town.
But what becomes a shock to Arthur is when he discovers the main source of income is that of salvaging parts of passing motorist's car after causing them to have a car accident.
There's not much in a way of suspense and it lumbers about in patches, but when the mayhem escalates it's plain devastating in its terrorising short bursts.
For example; when explaining to total strangers that you accidentally killed a old man by accidentally running your car over him, do you expect them to reply with: "Yeah, those old pedestrians are a real problem, aren't they?"
Peter Weir's first film and, looking back to when I originally saw this on general release, this could be described as my first exploitation movie.
Not overlong, it still seems a little slow now at times but it's probably because unlike in the mid 70s when this was considered unique , so much else has been seen.
The most funny thing is when they shouting memorials at the Grey yard.. i did not get the idea?
The movie rane, shows how the young generation was growing up when Milosevic was in power.
What's more, i think that these a******s from RTS ( Serbian TV and radio broadcast ( controled by Milosevic )) didn't even knew that they were digging the grave for themselves when they have invested the money in the movie!
In this film you'll see the sort of things you see when you quick-empty a bottle of vodka and then go and start a civil war.
The last lines of Pinki, when there is no more picture, only darkness left, and he dies when he said: "A sve mi se nesto cini, da sam prosao bolje od vas" or in translation: "I still have a weird feeling, that I came through better then you."
It is funny though to see him as a father and a grandfather when one is so used to seeing him as a bachelor, like in "La Dolce Vita".
I was able to feel the love he had for his children and also the hurt when the truth was brought out in front of him.
Even when he spits out wise words of advice to his offspring there isn't that unrealistic expectation from the viewer to gasp with shock, bewilderment and awe, something very common in so many other European movies, especially from the 60s and 70s.
This staple of Italian life and joy, the family table, now becomes Mateo's nightmare when he learns of Alvaro's death.
This foreshadowing of Mateo's life comes to fruition when at the film's end, Mateo is in a hospital room recovering from an episode of what can only be interpreted as the most profound disappointment of all--the loss of one's family.
I knew I was in trouble when the movie started with the hooker receiving a 2 dollar bill as change for her cab ride.
You've all read the plot summary - Rich brat kidnaps herself but gets more than she bargained for when her car is stolen from the garage and romance ensues.
And at the end, when he was living with the other freaks in the like run down abandoned circus?
My heart sank when ignorant folks would stare or respond to the twins as though they didn't already know they were different than the rest of the world.
Or when folks wanted to use them to get rich.
Seeing the love between the two brothers was so touching I had to get out a box of tissues when it came time for the surgeons to separate them.
How they delivered such poignant sensitivity about a pair of attached Siamese twins, when they themselves were not, is amazing.
The highlight of the film, for me, was the irrepressible Orville coming back from one death after another, and not seeming to hold all the abuses against anyone, when it's over.
To me, I know what to expect when I see a video box that has a woman on the front cover wearing a bra and holding a machine gun, along with a 4-Star Rating from Joe Bob Briggs.
Then I see sexy del Toro steal the car and freak out when he opened the trunk and saw her in there.
There are some interesting little tidbits about Looney Tunes--how they were originally made just for adults and how there was a big outcry when people realized Tweety Bird was naked (!!!).
Yes, and I wished it could have been done that way; unfortunately the money just isn't there in the multi-part series films so they're seldom done, except when the "owner" (such as Stephen King) has enough clout to insist.
Andrew had been in love with Little Miss when she married 50 or so years earlier, but as just an android could do nothing about it.
He wants to learn, wants to talk, wants to create, and through some mistake when he was being created he can.
This film shows Andrew's aim to become human, and follows his life from when he first became the 'machine' of the Martin family, to when he finally fell in love with their youngest daughters grand child, and becomes human to die beside her on their death beds.
I was in an extended stay in the hospital when this movie was released.
Indeed I did not know it had been made until several years later when I saw the video of Celine Dion's "Then You Look at Me", and recognized the scenes as being from the short story by Isaac Asimov.
There wasn't much fanfare about this movie when it played in theaters, probably because of its languid pace and its romantic atmosphere.
When I first saw it a few years later when there was nothing else on I was completely blown away by it.
Most of them appear when the picture becomes a bit emotionally heavy, in order to relieve such tension in the audience.
I grew up watching "Charlie's Angels" on ABC when it was a primetime series!
I think the series went downhill when Kate Jackson left.
I was 7 when Charlie's Angels first aired, little did I think that 30 years later, I would still be talking about the Angels.
Kris Muntoe (Cheryl Ladd) is the rookie angel, given many different strange covers and whose emotions heightens when the person hurt involves friends and sibling.
I was glad when it came to the later seasons that they played down this aspect of his character.
In my opinion the best seasons are two and three, maybe its partly because when i started watching it it was these seasons that i saw, but i do prefer Kris Munroe to Jill Munroe .
I was disappointed when she did not return to the series but ecstatic when she did the guest spots.
She was married to a fellow officer when she was still a cop but the marriage ended in divorce.
I think my favorite part of the show was when that "de de de deeee" music would play, that would signal that you have been had by an angel.
And when Jill returned, she was no longer charming and bubbly, she became snotty and aloof.
In the (incredible) end, when everything about this wonderful, crazy song you hear all the time makes sense, you are so captivated that you would never forgive Yolaf for making any other choice than the one that you also would have made given the chance.
People usually always mention Django and The Great Silence when talking about Corbucci's westerns but Companeros is perhaps his best work.
And then, when they are caught together by the press, Barbara agrees to pretend to be the governess and the baby is brought home to Menjou's wife as their new adopted kid!
The plan is for the "governess" to stick around and continue the affair, but when the wife doesn't like Barbara, Ms. Stanwyck just wanders off and leaves the baby in Menjou's care!!!
But, only a short time later, she shoots Bellamy when he learns the truth about the baby and Menjou (who is now the governor).
Forbidden was made at a time when Frank Capra was involved with both Lucille Reyburn who eventually he married and his star Barbara Stanwyck.
Meeting this middle-aged man Bob Grover, Adolphe Menjou, when he got his cabin room mixed up with hers Lulu ends up spending her vacation time in Havana with Bob who together paint the town red.
Back in the states the two fall madly in love with each other but when it comes to tie the knot Bob has a confession to make to Lulu.
The bottom falls out of both Bob and Lulu's secret relationship when the sleaze-ball editor of that yellow rag "The Record" Al Holland, Ralph Bellamy, spots little Roberta with Lulu.
Now, there's some things in this film that seem a little nonsensical or odd to me - Lulu is first seen as a sort of librarian/spinster type - but quickly changes into a smartly dressed, attractive lady when she leaves on her trip, and never changes back (the original plot element abandoned).
Out of her sheer devotion to him she decides not to cause a scandal when she falls pregnant.
This Edison short is hilarious, although you have to be very tired when watching it.
Perhaps not the most kind thing to do but you also have to remember that this was 1894 when these sort of animal vaudeville acts were very common and part of everyday's life.
It's a childish impulse at heart, but great when you're deconstructing philosophies.
She is faking a kidnapping an hides in the trunk of a car waiting to be found; he is a car thief and steals that car, takes it to his garage and discovers that someone is making noiseÂThis scene is fantastic because the thief acts like he doesn't understand, and when he discovers it is only a girl, he gets scared.
From then on Bruford gets flashbacks on all the times he sold out and recalls a crucial moment when he screwed over his own brother Flip(Afemo Omilami)by refusing to come help him out when he tried to get a job at his workplace.
Rocky has a more diplomatic approach that seems to have been more effective back in earlier times around when the group was founded.
Not to mention when African Americans try to reconnect with their past they are constantly bombarded by some of the same Whites who at times, seem a little bit too concerned with keeping this connection at bay, as if it were a threat of some sort.
We didn't have a problem when we where in the forefront, so why would it matter now if we're in the background?
As an old lady, Jones is stiff and awkward and you hope that in the flashbacks she might be given the chance to blossom but this is a one-dimensional performance and she's as bad as an only half-decent actress can be when cast against type.
I only discovered this movie about 18 months ago when I saw it on TV.
Under a stern and crusty exterior Miss Dove reflects on the course of her life as a teacher, when she is rushed to the hospital.
To avoid a scandal when the father dies suddenly, Dove becomes a teacher to pay off the debt.
The cop who adores her, her nurse who idolizes her, a Broadway playwright, who she guided when he was fresh out of Poland,and a former student, Freddie Makepiece, a jailbird, brings comic relief as well.
Robert Stack is wonderful as the doctor, her former student, who operates on her; as well as Peggy Knudsen, a fine practical nurse who adores her and at the same time harbors a secret; Chuck Connors, as the police officer, who Dove helped mold despite his poor background, only to reject Knudsen when he discovers her secret.
The film begins slowly ,but when it hits its stride,after about thirty minutes ,it grabs you till the very end ,with more and more verbal violence.
Nevertheless, I try not to miss any of his films when they crop up on Italian or French Cable TV channels and, for what it's worth, I've always been on the look-out for at least two of his late 50s films - Claude Autant-Lara's LOVE IS MY PROFESSION (1958; with Brigitte Bardot) and the film under review here.
Anyway, Gabin is perfectly cast as the world-weary Police Inspector who is pondering retirement when the re-emergence of an old nemesis - a serial-killer who stabs lonely brunettes coming home late at night - taunts him back into action with a supremely clever plan to trap the killer, hence the film's title.
So, when the rain finally starts falling in the final seconds of the movie, it does as much good to bulky, weary Gabin as it does to the tense viewer.
Already from the beginning, when Dennis (Marcell Schlutt) arrives in prison, the border between drama and porn is crossed - he has to undress in front of two uniformed macho men.
that I actually found myself laughing out loud many times, particularly when both leads were locked up under "arrest" in adjoining cells and touched hands through their respective windows -- now that is cinema!!
The love development between two real prisonners are only evident when Dennis saw Mike just saw each other two times - that's all.
If you watch the added features interviews with the characters, it is hard to imagine it is even the same movie they are discussing when you watch it.
Generally when somebody screws up, they go through three sets of filters in the course of attempts at correction.
For some reason, when this film was first shown, there were segments which portrayed the poisoning of Marie's mother- and that she initially lived in a trailer.
There are some amusing scenes also, such as when Hilley teaches her daughter how to parallel park, by driving through (and over) the graves at the local cemetery.
This is so obviously a television movie, since the editing looks like it was done with a meat cleaver, but there are some priceless moments in this film, chiefly among them when Marie, juggling three different identities, "dies" as Robbi and comes back as her platinum-haired twin sister Teri.
Kevin Kline was also incredible with his portrayal of someone with a schizophrenic disorder before the time when that sort of thing was recognized.
Then we return to deep subjectivity of the alternate one, and when we come back, no matter how unchanged the initial setting remains, we are never the same.
When we are his age, we never believe people, no matter how much we respect them or love them, when they tell us that there is so much we don't understand.
As the film begins, we are introduced to the two people he happens to meet when he moves to Brooklyn.
We have no reason to believe that when they behave, speak and react, they are inventing or denying anything.
Streep makes her tremulous and lovely, nervous and chatty while also politely flustered, and there are moments when she's radiant.
I especially love the part in the beginning when Sophie and Nathan are arguing on the stairwell and he finds Stingo eavesdropping.
I STILL cry when I watch it!
Streep and Kline are portrayed as intellectual fun-loving free spirits, when they're really just a couple of neurotic con artists.
Until that day came when I finally watched her blew me away in what I dubbed as a magnificently explosive performance.
The flesh tones are perfect, the image is solid and the colours, when in full bloom, are exquisitely formed.
Speaking three languages (including a very realistic portrayal of how foreigners can hesitate and hunt for words when speaking English), going from a haggard Auschwitz inmate to a pretty "blooming rose," consumed by guilt even during the madcap or romantic moments she shares with Nathan, she gives a brilliant performance of a very complex character.
You really find yourself rooting for him--especially when he meets and saves the life of a lady.
I suppose the tension bubbling under the surface does provide a comedic highlight; as Marco lies dreamily on the bed and coos to his supposedly 'docile' mate that he didn't know what he'd come across when he first met her - cut to our heroine assembling a gun in the bathroom...
This especially shows when she is speaking German flawlessly, or English with a very convincing Polish accent.
He therefore might be overlooked, when viewing at the movie as a whole.
Yet, New York Times Critic Bosley Crowthers dismissed it as just a "colorful film" when it opened in 1944.
The story of Buffalo Bill (Joel McCrea) is showed basically in two parts, beginning in 1877: in the West, when he meets his future wife Louisa Frederici Cody (Maureen O'Hara), his friendship with the Indians, specially with Yellow Hand (Anthony Quinn), and his work, as an explorer of the wild West, ending when his wife returns to the East with his baby son and with a battle against the Cheyenne.
The second part begins when he moves to the East, loses his son, separates from his wife, defends the Indians in the civilized society until his retirement.
The second part is when Buffalo Bill goes east, and that is when the film is at its best.
This duality of screen and real life became so much the part of our lives that we are shocked when we are shown the life as it is.
During the viewing I wished that the director had bothered to show us what exactly the main character spoke to his eel when they two communicate, because the eel seems the only connect he had and mean a lot to him.
It's about the way women really do set themselves up for disappointment when they always fall for the "bad boy."
The performances are straight out of reality and when coupled with the direction it made me feel that I was a fly on the wall.
Stacy Edwards as the deaf Christine is also very strong; in fact, when I saw her in another movie speaking normally I almost fell out of my chair.
However, things get complicated when Howard falls in love for Cristina.
This is a totally unexpected find, a movie that you know nothing about when you sit down to watch it, yet totally engrosses you and blows you away.
We don't see the plan initially, but when it comes into light at the end, it hits us deep within our gut, giving us more pain than the Christine incident.
Then, when he thought that we were not paying attention, he gave us the ending of a lifetime.
THE EEL borders on dark humour when a man, who after eight years in prison for the murder of his wife, is released from jail.
Is it any wonder that Chad and Howard decide to make a game of their seduction of Katherine when it's clear they've had to plan their whole careers as if they were competing in a game of some kind?
Where a lot of movie villains "indicate" to let you know they're just acting (which does work when it's done right), Eckhart gives away nothing, so you never know what he's thinking, even if he tells you what he's thinking.
The two men start to date Christine, but problems start to arise when Howard bumps into them both in a restaurant.
I couldn't help but think of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross, another film about corporate greed in today's world when I was watching this one.
"Strange Fruit.A poem written by a Jewish high school teacher Abel Meeropol.A song made famous by Billie Holiday.Abel wrote it after he saw a photo depicting the lynching of a black man in the south.Something so beautiful came out of such a tragic event.Shivers go down your spine when you hear Billie Holiday perform it.Your eyes get wet.You ask yourself why and yet you get no answer.How could something like that happen such a short time ago?
And here's the big surprise of the documentary: when we finally see Holiday, it is not on film, but on live television.
As a bonus, when you purchase this DVD, you get a bonus CD with about half of the show on it.
SPOILER: Some of the violence in this movie was actually laughable, in a sick kinda way, when the blonde cowboy kid runs towards the fence, gets electrocuted and ends up flying right off it, looked almost comical.
The cast chosen are all attractive, with athletic, toned bodies, their attitudes and mores appropriate for each stock character, represented by the actors / actresses without a hint of depth..they are designed specifically one-dimensional, representing the hunky bad boy, hick cowboy, Latina chick with an attitude, gay and slightly chubby goofball, shy Asian girl with martial arts skills, black intellectual(..his dialogue, particularly when he speaks "scholarly" is as artificial as it gets), hot beach bunny who comes from money and is easy to seduce, etc.
Susan Ward is your eye candy for the movie, the sex pot who gets a little "off the top" when she attempts to escape from the grounds.
Brian Geraghty is terrific as the hot Southern boy Colin, who surprisingly shows the most humanity in the film, especially when placed in a "kill or be killed" situation.
It seemed more surreal when it came to the 'cruel' scenes of murder, as far as acting.
Especially, when it came to the meet and greet sessions pool side.
Cruel World has taken years to release, with about a dozen supposed release dates and practically zero updates on when the movie was going to release.
I mean, when was the last time you saw an Asian female being chased by a maniac...only to pee on him and do martial arts kicks?
They take him in and take care of him, but when he wakes up he has no memory of who he is except that he has a fondness for chocolate and starts behaving like a little child!
There are many funny and touching scenes, as when Keiko tries stubbornly to provide Yamashita with a lunch bag against his will, and the many nightly fishing trips, where our hero releases the fish as soon as they are caught, are also unforgettable.
The action wasn't much emphasized as in rather friendship, but when the action does kick in, it brings you to the same level as John Woo's bullet exchange, and heck, even Dragon (the bodyguard) knows some kick ass moves when he fights.
Further trauma to poor Chocolate follows which leads to a showdown that highlights the God of Gamblers uncanny ability to win, even when opponents cheat and "friends" betray.
Indeed, when it's all over, their is nothing left of Burt's car but four wheels, a steering column, the engine and a seat!
However, this all changes when he is told he has just a short time to live.
I saw this when it was released and never forgot it, most of my friends also remember it clearly!
It is a wonderful glimpse into the lives of lesbians in the 50s, in many ways different from now - the hidden=ness and secrecy, the butch femme culture - and in many ways so the same - who was going out with who, when, how they fell in love, broke up, wove their lives and made family of their friendships.
What is amazing about what The Eel does is how it really enlightens the audience when it comes to the judgment and expectations of characters.
I love the scene when Nicky cooks for his girlfriend.. really funny.. it reminds me of myself..
At the same time, their cousin Bobby (Jason Andrews) finds himself dangerously in debt and when collection time nears, Ralphie agrees to help him raise the needed cash through an ingenious and illicit scheme.
This would account for the bad acting and careless execution of a story that had been seen so many times before even when the film was began in 1967.
This involves, with a Commie-apocalypse twist worked in, what happens when a crew of astronauts discover their mission to Venus was actually an attempt to advance the human race beyond an impending nuclear apocalypse (which is unbelievable even with the most infinite amount of suspension of disbelief).
These men and women learn they will be playing "Adam" and "Eve" -- except for Henry Wilcoxon (as Dr. Perry), who is portrayed as too old for sex, at age 61 (when this was filmed).
The communist Chinese develop the gumball technology of doom, who's detonation force will "rupture the faults of the earth's surface and setup a chain reaction of explosions when the earth's tension is broken."
You are probably asking yourself how will you know when that is?
It is when the second movie starts, all with different faceless-actors in a dark room doing stuff.
The movie recovers some of its sanity for fifteen minutes or so when the crew's more admirable members show their willingness to sacrifice themselves to save the others, by leaving the craft in a spacewalk to fix a jammed device, seconds before the segment the two heroes were on was jettisoned.
Wouldn't you think a red light would have gone on somewhere when they started talking about Elizabeth Taylor (whom I love) as Desiree?
As the film opens, Yamashita, a worker at a large flour company, is startled to read an anonymous letter on the train coming home from work informing him that his wife cheats on him when he goes away on overnight fishing trips.
Reminded of his former wife, Yamashita avoids intimacy but she is drawn to him nonetheless and offers him box lunches when he goes fishing.
The story, which until now has had a rich dramatic arc, soon descends into forced comedy when Keiko's mentally-challenged mother shows up doing flamenco dances and Keiko's former boyfriend returns demanding her mother's money.
I was so excited to see a film adaptation of A Little Night Music, but grew suspicious when I saw that Elizabeth Taylor is in it.
I remember when I first saw this in a movie theater.
I could understand their elimination, but when it came to the remainder of the score, gone was Carl-Magnus' solo "In Praise of Women", Madame Armfeldt's biting and nostalgic "Liaisons", and Petra's poignant "The Miller's Son".
Yes, it is flawed in context to the Broadway original, but considering it was made when film musicals were all but dead in Hollywood, it is amazing that it even exists.
Yet when all of the forces collide in the climax of the film, Takuro realizes how much of his past is mixed with fantasy/nightmare and, equally, how much his present is dependent on his interaction with Keiko (now pregnant with Dojima's baby), the priest, his sci-fi friend and the forces who would destroy Keiko and his quiet existence.
It's bad enough to be stuck in one of these places when you're on a road trip and you need gas, and it's too late to find a decent place to sleep, it's disturbing to see this on film.
I saw this film back in 1980/81 when it was first released and liked it a lot then.
The situation changes when, on instigation of the priest, a girl starts assisting him in his shop.
The man says that he is Howard Hughes, and, years later, when Hughes dies, Melvin finds a will that has been left on his filling station desk that names him as one of the heirs to the Hughes fortune.
This work, directed horrendously by Leo McCarey, was a sorry thing when it was first released during the McCarthy-Witch Hunt period.
The most embarrassing moments occur when Hayes forces her son to spill his dreaded secrets... ARRRRGGGHHH.
Behaviour is checked, emotions kept inward; yet when people look inward they find a seething that terrifies.
This crucial moment in the film, when Yamashita fights Dojima and his thugs, against her past and his, is filmed as slapstick; the humour in unnerving.
I saw this film when it appeared on Canadian TV some years ago.
But I do make note of political slant when it is the obvious point of a film.
So much time is spent in showing the family going to church and doing this and that to establish its All-American bona fides (the father even sings patriotic songs when drunk, and two younger sons are pointedly shown to be football players, which was not the case with that Black Sheep John) that there is very little action.
You know right away something's amiss when he shows up late, not really having the heart to wish his brothers well in fighting against the Reds in Korea.
But for the life of me I can't figure out why McHugh adopted a brogue for this film when he had none in Going My Way.
I saw this film only once when it was broadcast on network television (ABC, I think) during the late 1960's or early 1970's.
Patriarch Dean Jagger is a schoolteacher, Legionnaire, pipe-smoker and beer-drinker (though when vexed switches to Bourbon).
But I remember when I first viewed this really peculiar glop, at the tender age of about 10, only a year or two after it had premiered, I was unimpressed even then.
Mr. Wilson was truly one of America's finest business leaders: not only did he start on the assembly line for GM but, even when he was CEO, he kept his Union card framed and on the wall of his office.
And one AMAZING surprise awaits you when you see the Dogpatch girls singing "Put 'Em Back the Way They Was" and notice that a very young VALERIE HARPER is one of the Dogpatch girls!
I first saw this movie when it came out and thought it marvelous.
LOL Trouble with Hanna-Barbera, though, is once they had a good thing going, they didn't know when to stop.
He guest starred he was orange and then when he got his own cartoon he was pink with cuffs and collar tie which made him look like a brother to the Pink Panther almost.
I liked some of the Yakky Doodle cartoons when they have Fibber Fox in them.
What was Joan Crawford thinking when she accepted this incredibly bad 1937 vehicle?
Crawford and Powell try getting some money out of Morgan, and when they do, they promptly relinquish it.
Davis was obviously very ill when she did this.
Also when Carrara takes over it actually gets worse.
Bette Davis was coming off the mild success of THE WHALES OF AUGUST when she decided to do this movie about a witch who moves into a family's home and causes havoc there.
also Colleen Camp is awesome and did a lot of cool movies in the 80's...'Valley Girl' & 'Clue' anyways...I'd buy it if came out on DVD...of course I'm a Bette Davis fan and to all the the negative people making comment's "She'll take a tumble on you, role you like you were dice until you come up Blue...She's Got Bette Davis Eyes" ....well the movie is worth seeing for her alone and I to wish she was in it more but at least they kept her scenes and it's funny with some of the cracks like the Joan Crawford picture & when she's on the phone and there's a huge picture of Bette from the 1940's on the side of the wall.
This movie literally made me want to throw things, and by the end, I was crying in desperation at how sad Zachary sounded, and shaking my head when the verdict was said.
We bleed when we are cut.
Weep when we are hurt, and have feelings to our loved ones and to our children just as strong and just as powerful as any other humans.
I am sure that when her son is grown and is able to understand the manipulations of his grandmother and the injustices done to his mother he will choose to be with her again.
What exactly is the point of making a sequel when you don't actually retain anything that was good about the original?
At the same time, the film pauses where you want it to, gives you a silent moment to watch Bambi's ears fall slowly when he is disappointed, or freeze with him when he's terrified.
The methods here in conveying emotion are excellent; you really feel it when Bambi is sad or trying to earn his father's pride, and there are moments when you feel him growing up.
It was as sequels usually are...  Bambi was a such a huge movie when I was a kid.
Anyways, when compared to the other sequels Disnaye has been releasing, this flaws are really minor, as "Bambi II" makes a nice addition that at times surpasses the current theatrical released Disney films.
It's an intoxicating feeling when a movie excites and enlivens us like this -- and there's a particular giddiness to be had in thinking about what movies can (but don't often) do for one's soul after imbibing such a fine vintage!
Anyways, when I heared that Bambi 2 was coming out I rolled my eyes and thought that here goes another classic.
But I looked at Bambi 2 in a whole new light when I heard that Andreas Deja (one of Disney's best animators) was on board for the project.
It's a great in between story about from when Bambi's mother dies and he is reunited with his father the Great Prince.
I had no expectations whatsoever of this movie when my family and I sat down to watch it.
We also get to know Ronno when he was little.
The time when this takes place makes one wonder and to make this question even more difficult, there are things that do not make sense when we look at the way how things happen in the original.
I loved the return of Thumper, it's always a pleasure to see him on screen, I loved when he was trying to show Bambi's father that Bambi could be brave, but Bambi needed more time, so Thumper does his best to distract Bambi's dad, it was so cute and funny.
See, Disney has lost its charm by this point (it's lost it for years--at least since the 70's, when the films became more savvy than charming) and they were trying to necromance a charming movie.
Instead of the atmospheric silence of the original film, we have hideous pop songs slapped in when the characters aren't yapping.
I watched the original Bambi movie frequently when I was young, so seeing such a great sequel of one of my favorite childhood movies really heartens me.
Especially when compared to many other substandard Disney sequels, Bambi 2 is definitely a superb continuation of the classic masterpiece.
This made no sense, but what was worse was the reaction her new society friends had when her plan came to light.
I'm an 18 year old guy, and I watched Bambi for the first time when I was 3 years old and I still remember how sad I felt when his mom died.
I was really worried when I heard there was going to be a sequel.
However, when they lives longer and longer, the father and son relationship grew.
The main character is supposed to be an idiot I guess since it defies all logic that a woman in this situation would not call the Pigs when things start to get hairy.
I have to say that when I worked as a plumber I was quite competent and I did not wreck people's houses.
I can recall one time when I was called out to an apartment that had water dripping into it from the unit above.
Think about it - not only is he in there with a guitar and singing when he is supposed to be fixing the plumbing, but he has a neck mounted harmonica too!
View On The Film:  Peter "The Master And Commander:The Far Side Of The World" Weir, keeps the film going at a really good pace and makes sure to keep it moving fast.Unlike a film thats very "similar" to this,The Cable Guy,this film does not go as dark as that film,which helps to give it a more realistic feel.Though Weir gives it some good comedy,(like,when the Plumber does a spoof of Dylans,It Ain't Me Babe,by doing a song called-Its Me Babe!
Only when the film moves to land sequences does it have any credibility and there are still plenty of cardboard backdrops to help the film become even more foolish.
But its the second half, when "The Graf Spee" hides in a neutral port where it kicks into high gear.
I love the scene when her "servants" reveal themselves.
What was his reaction when he sighted the three British cruisers?
I saw this film as a little boy when it came out in the 50's and thought it was great.
They share only four scenes, but it is remarkable about how smooth the scenes are - like a perfect set of volleyball games with no shots and counter shots missed by either party (and when Crawford joins them she is equally smooth in responding to both her leading men).
The word was "Plata"--meaning Silver River when correctly translated into English.
They will also find the use of models for some of the battle scenes less than convincing when compared to the larger-than-life realism of computer-generated imagery.
The cameras of the world's press focused on Montevideo as the German ship struggled to regain its fighting ability while the Royal Navy converged to attack when it was, inevitably, forced to leave.
Also the fact that all of these people just happen to converge on this same cottage on the same day is just too much coincidence as is not having phone service when they were apparently only about three miles from a road.
Either way, Vinnie Jones doesn't deserve to be in this film, and with the exception of a few moments when the cinematography is pretty well done, this film doesn't lend itself to a single viewing.
Having the characters come together gradually was also clever, I like it when films do this, because it shows that all the characters had a life before the event, and not just the main character.
Well, when the Bog Body comes back to life by being put in water (are they like "Sea Monkeys"?)
but it goes downhill pretty fast when we meet the rest of the cast.
He may just be one of the most distinctly British actors in the history of cinema...when the dude's on screen you can't help but think "holy crap, that guy is British".
That's how boring it is...in a HORROR MOVIE, during the CLIMAX, when everything's supposed to go all to hell and be the most entertaining, I briefly nodded off.
The fact that the poster for this one has a big picture of Vinnie Jones on it - when in fact he's not the lead - if forgivable.
Anyway, Bog Men can, apparently, be reconstituted when dipped into water.
I originally saw this show when I was a little kid and I think it came on Tuesday nights on NBC.
From what others have said, ole Elroy P. Lobo was a corrupt Sheriff but on his own series, he was a Protagonist who was corrupt, but not evil like he was when he debuted as BJ McKay's major adversary.
I liked Birdie and he was who I wanted to be like when I watched the show.
The first season was truly the best, but I will admit when the show changed its title to Lobo and the characters moved to Atlanta Georgia to be country cops in the big city, that sucked, but I still watched them.
I was 11 years old when this show came on the air.
"I'll show you college boy" was always his favorite line when speaking to deputy "Birdie" Birdwell Hawkins (Brian Kerwin)the Mayors son, who was college educated.
i was probably around 6 when this show came out but my family watched it every week and i have very fond memories of it.
when he got his own show, suddenly hes a good guy.
"Lobo" was the show critics loved to hate when it was on the air.
Furthermore, these characters are always self-sincere--they actually buy their own hype--and consequently, when they get caught in the act or if become aware of their own bluster and ruse, it becomes very awkward and it's really surprising how naturally the awkwardness keeps showing up.
The film doesn't explain why she decided to go to a motel with him, even when he seemed violent and over-assertive.
It means progression or change in time, but when removing yourself to observe the composition of a story, what if interims and languid moments between characters, or one character, equipped it with its expression?
But that's your call when you see it.
This is all taken very seriously until near the end when some lame one-liners and attempts at litening up the mood don't work at all.
IÂ´m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie, but I did it 15 minutes after the Trance started.
Anyway, When I got more disappointed was when I saw in the video cover, that the film was presented by "Stephen King", I think he could never present this crap, no?
Well - when the cameo appearance of Jason Miller (looking even more eroded than he did in Exorcist IV) is the high point of a picture, what've you got?
In the face of all of this, the awful truth alluded to in the first over-voice is - omigod - an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old.
Saw a trailer for this on another video, and decided to rent when it came out.
Alice's smoking, drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting.
Lamest of all is the film's dubious morality: no one blinks an eye when an otherwise likable Lugosi knifes a cat; and the ending sees Manners and Bishop enjoying one of those it's-all-over-now, ho-ho epilogues after they've accidentally shot Lugosi in the back and made a run for it while everyone else explodes.
Frankly the words "Lisa Kudrow" and movie just make shudder, but a friend who's taste in movies is just a bit different then my own suggested it so when I saw it playing on TMN I thought I'd watch it.
A good cast and they do their best with what they're given, but the story makes no sense, the characters' actions are inexplicable, and there are too many moments of unintentional humor, as when a man is killed by being pierced with pieces of a phonograph record or when they get the witch drunk to a hip hop beat and then hit her over the head with a bottle and she grabs her hostage and pouts off.
The scene when the two witch and her victim (played by the same actress) are in the house together sets up like a 3 Stooges routine, and the plot begs the question: if the witch wants to possess this other woman's soul, why doesn't she just do it instead of leading these people on this elaborate chase?
Other things I love about this movie: The opening song, with the line "And no one is afraid/Of themselves" (a key to the characters' struggle)--- The cry of anguish when a mother finds her son dead (we see it but we can only imagine the sound of it)--- Death by shards of a broken rock-and-roll album (and the cutaway to the murderess on the beach, sad but resigned to the fact of her own survival).
The medium has advanced severalfold in the 100 years between today and when the LumiÃ¨re brothers contributed to the invention of cinÃ©ma.
It clarifies and elaborates upon a few of the other short films that had people staring into the camera (which harks back to 100 years ago when people weren't familiar with movie cameras).
Doris Doerrie is one of those directors who leave no traces on my consciousness: when I see one of her films, I start forgetting it right away.
The reason he gives at first is that he doesn't want married couple put in danger but even when they are he just plays along.
And again back to the acting: look at how Bela reacts to the cat or how is servant looks when he first falls.
My favorite part also is when the Medal of Honor is shown to the two Marines who snap to attention and salute.
My favorite is when Tony reveals the Medal of Honor to the two Marines who snap to attention and salute.
For the most part, they get the language right (bulkhead, etc) and the customs (not saluting when your cover is off, etc) Michael Weatherly is a good actor who can go from acting goofy to serious parts (like the time, he had the plague) And of course there is Leroy Jethro Gibbs.
This positive view of sexual sharing is rewarded as it takes him out of the house when the mob catch up with them, giving him the opportunity to sneak back into the house, overpower the mobsters and make his escape with his buddies.
The Black Cat (1934)   Edgar Ulmer was one of Universal Studio's hopes in 1934, when this movie was their biggest hit of the season (this is three years after the explosion of Dracula and Frankenstein).
As the episode unfolds we learn what happened to Seymour after Fry was frozen...and what Fry decides to do when his fossilized remains are recovered in the future.
Imagine Raven a little earlier than when he met up with Veronica Lake and got into the home of a couple like Bickford and Royle and you have a pretty good idea of what Ladd's character Choya is like in Branded.
I saw Branded when it was released in the fifties ,with crowded matinÃ©es.
I enjoyed it and still enjoyed it when I saw it recently.
It also, in many ways, hearkens back to the early westerns of William S. Hart which date from 1914 to 1925, when movies were still in their infancy.
That's why when I see something different I am excited--and this film, fortunately, has a lot to offer that is different and worth seeing.
THe kid was kidnapped and then assumed murdered when he was quite young.
You could tell that MatÃ© really had "the eye" when he made this film.
Some comments seem to find it a plot hole when Lugosi kills a  house pet and no one is alarmed -indeed, not something  common in the world as we know it.
This is a classic gangster film which is surprisingly hard hitting for its age, it amazing to think that this film is nearly eighty years old and that prohibition was still in force when it was made.
Along with childhood friend he takes a job for local gangster "Putty Nose" things go wrong on their first job however when the police turn up and kill another of the gang.
Initially things go well for them, they have plenty of money, beautiful girl friends and smart clothes but when the mob's hard man Nails Nathan is killed in a freak riding accident a rival gang see it as an opportunity to take over.
The violence is never graphic although it can still be fairly hard hitting such as when Tommy goes into the stable of the horse which had killed Nails and two shots ring out and the films most famous scene where he pushes half a grapefruit into his girl friend's face.
Further, it belongs to the beginning of the sound age, and William Wellman uses this resource magnificently, like for example, when the truck is discharging coal to disguise the shooting.
Of course this has the grapefruit scene, but there are many great scenes, like when Cagney tells a bartender "eh, you're yella" and gives him a slap.
He fails to convince only when his character is forced into mock-congeniality.
His most effective moments are not when he casts his sinister glare at Bela Lugosi or Jacqueline Wells, but when he plays the organ or stands outside amidst the windswept trees, enraptured by his thoughts of the Black Mass to come.
Splendid setpieces hilite this chronicle of a gangster's rise and fall; perhaps best known is the ol' Grapefruit to the Face trick Jim pulls on Mae Clarke, but my favorite is when they deliver the body to Mama, on a slab.
The Public Enemy includes one of the most famous scenes in cinema history when Cagney shoves a grape-fruit into his lover's face.
The problems are common for most of the period of the early talkies when actors didn't really know that the exaggerated expression of the silent era was no longer needed.
Although Mr. Woods is directed to wipe his hand with his sleeve when he first appears, it looks like the boys' roles are mixed up with the adult men -- Mr. Coghlan Jr. (a fine performance, by the way) resembles Woods more than Cagney; and, Mr. Darro more closely resembles Cagney.
After the local "Fagin", known as "Putty Nose" double crosses them, leaving them out in the street following a burglary gone bad (Putty had set them up with the burglary job, and then when a Beat Cop got killed in the process by the young hoods, old Putty locked his door on them).
Newlyweds Peter and Joan Allison (David Manners, Jaqueline Wells) are traveling by train to a honeymoon resort when they are joined by a mysterious stranger, Dr. Vitus Werdegast (Bela Lugosi).
Eventually they even the score with "Putty Nose", who pleads for his life when they catch with him.
In this vein, I found a great poignancy within the usual discomfort I have when viewing gangster films.
Tom and Matt grow up into young men who are hoodlums in the employ of Puttynose, who teaches them the tricks of the trade, an Irish Fagin, but he breaks his promise and skips out on them when they need his help.
Also along the way you see can see the building blocks for basically every subsequent gangster film: the misogyny (most famously illustrated when Cagney, sitting at the breakfast table with his moll, suddenly reaches over and smacks her in the face with a grapefruit; the disapproving family members; the protagonist's more moral sidekick ( a type seen as recently as in the Brazilian crime epic City of God).
Tom Powers rises to the top of the crime scene when Prohibition went into effect.
Further evidence of his cheap personality is shown when he instantly falls for the vulgar, tasteless girl Gwen (Jean Harlow).
My first surprise came when the audience was addressed by a festival employee who told us that although the movie was German, the dialogue was English.
This film is irresponsible-the ideas that the viewer is exposed to are not easy to forget when given this sort of treatment.
When the bus they are riding meets an accident, the couple and Dr. Vitus are forced to spend the night in the mansion of Poelzig (Boris Karloff), Vitus' old acquaintance who has more than hospitality in mind when taking them in.
Here, he makes most of each and every bit of decent dialogue (note the plenty of close ups on Lugosi or Karloff when they spew a line that somehow is miraculously inspired), and utilizes music, production design, and cinematography, to raise the plot to a higher level.
It's sad when rabid horror-movie fans give up on a movie and hope for sex on screen to save it.
All i have to say is that this "movie" gave me those rare moments in life when you literally stay with your mouth open.
The wheelchair camera in the hospital is something new for that time alongside the short lens action when the killer advances at the hospital stairs.
So when the police led by Inspector Silvestri(Claudio Cassinelli) with the assistance of the asst district attorney Vittoria Stori (Giovanna Ralli) realise that they are investigating a teen prostitute ring with some highly influential people involved, they know they are going to have a tough time convicting anyone and sure enough their investigation is dogged with interference and dead ends.
From the director of the excellent what have you done to Solange, Massimo Dallamano, here is a strange Italian giallo, more a police procedural (an a really lurid tale, a ring of teens used as prostitutes by people in very high places - that was the time, in Italy, when several directors and scripwriters tried their hands on very hot subjects, like this one) than an Argentian thriller (but it is scary enough in a few places and also very gory).
She also pleaded illness when she was afraid to attend the Academy Awards--afraid she might lose--but put her make-up on for the cameras when the radio announcement came that she won.
I didn't know whether to laugh or cry when I watched Torch Song.
He told about the scene when Nikita gets the guns in the red box as a present and is told to kill a man behind her in the restaurant, run out of the room, look for the men's toilet, check the last cabinet and climb out on the small window there with place only for a women of her size to get through; the car is waiting for her for 5 minutes outside.
Everyone kowtows to Jenny and cowers when she has her frequent outbursts, everyone except Tye Graham, a blind pianist hired to be her accompanist.
Of course, they will inevitably fall in love, but this absurdity occurs almost in a vacuum since director Charles Walters seems more interested in showing Jenny as a raging harpy when she isn't acting pitiable in the privacy of her bedroom.
One day Jenny meets up with a piano player named Tye Graham, (Michael Wilding) who is a blind veteran and is a sort of substitute piano player when the original piano player quit and walked off the Broadway Production.
This is a great romantic story because when Tye was able to see, he viewed Jenny Stewart in a show where Jenny sung the song, "Tenderly" and he never forgot her great performance.
It's later when Jenny learns through her beer drinking mom Mrs. Stewart, Marjorie Rambeau, the truth about Tye from and old scrapbook that she had about her daughters road to success that the truth finally came out to what was behind Tye's conduct towards her!
However, one day she comes across Tye Graham (played by Michael Wilding, who pronounces "Graham" as "Grimm"--rather appropriate) when he is hired to replace her burned-out rehearsal pianist.
I can only hope it wasn't her decision, or that she was in some alcohol-induced stupor when she had it done.
The first of the two scenes comes when Jenny attempts some everyday tasks as a blind person--she tries to set the clock, as I mentioned earlier, and she also tries to make a phone call.
The second scene is when she goes to see her mother, the only friend she's got.
The wretched excess is highlighted by the legendary star's dubbed "Two-Faced Woman" production number; keep watching for the moment, shortly after the song, when "black-faced" Crawford pulls off her "wig", in ghastly fashion.
And when Joan tears off the black wig at the end to show that blazing red hair it hits new heights of camp!
Perhaps blackface was chosen for the "shocking" moment when she angrily rips off her wig and glares into the auditorium with her enormous eyes and red slash of a mouth -- topped with disheveled hair dyed a remarkable Technicolor "red" that even Lucille Ball wouldn't have dared attempt.
Probably the most exciting scene is when Jenny decides to throw a party on a Sunday night after a week of grueling rehearsals because she has her eye on Tye and wants to get to "know" him better.
Then, when Jenny learns that Tye isn't going to come to the party, she tells her agent (in the privacy of her bedroom--which looks like it was lifted off the set of "Twilight Zone") to get everyone "out" of her apartment "now."
Then the ending, when, after "discovering" the review that Tye wrote about her, Jenny "realizes" that all this time he had been trying to tell her that he loved her, she rushes to his absolutely fabulous gorgeous perfectly appointed apartment and (apparently) tells his blonde sycophant wannabe-girlfriend to get lost (all very subtly actually).
I really don't know what anyone was trying to "say" with this film, but trust me, whatever it is, it can't possibly compare to when Joan orders "Lobster Newburg and coffee" -- now THAT is saying something (even if it's pathetic)!
My fave part of this movie is the part when Griff & his son take pictures of the girls trying to smile like the Mona Lisa.
when he discovers them hiding in a lifeboat.
Seeing it again recently by pure chance, I was more or less ready to be deluded, as often when you're rediscovering movies you liked as a child.
Unfortunately; the Commies have had the same idea, and when activated; both computers meet in the electronic ethers, and it's love at first byte.
set things in motion that influenced my life and what I did when I grew up.
Dated, even when it was made, this movie is still good fun.
Considering the age of this movie AND the fact that I saw it when it first aired (okay, so I'm dating myself), it remains one of the most compelling computer-related films I've ever seen.
Needless to say, when this was announced for DVD release, I was ready to leap at the chance of finally being able to own and watch the film Â but, as many of you must already know, my joy (and that of many another fan, I'm sure) was short-lived when it emerged that Universal had issued a Pan-and-Scan version (which I can only imagine now how this ruined its detailed widescreen compositions)!
In the "Goofs" section of this listing, there is a paragraph entitled "Revealing Mistakes" which reports an error when Dr. Forbin blows out two candles with one breath.
If you look at the scene prior to this when Dr. Forbin and Dr. Markham are eating dinner, there are FOUR lit candles on the table.
Typically, my fear response only kicks in when I see a potent image thrust at me quickly or when a movie uses unusual, eerie sounds to induce anxiety.
I have not seen this movie in 30 years, but I remember every scene as if it were yesterday, and the deep feelings that I had when I first saw it lingers on as well.
Why are people afraid to fly when their chances of being killed in an auto crash are so many times greater?
Even when they kill a few million, it is done without malice.
And when the two machines begin sharing information at a speed nobody can believe, an attempt is made to disable them.
This is one of the very rare occasions when the movie is better, much much better, than the book.
Dr Verdegast suggests they seek refuge in Hjalmar Poelzig's (Borris Karloff) house, who is an old acquaintance of his and he's secretly seeking revenge against him for the death of his wife and betraying his country by slaughtering his entire army when it was sacrificed to Satan during WW1.
This is when Satanists and sacrificial ceremonies fill the story.
The reasons behind this apparent lack of interest were probably related to how costly and laborious was the process of hand-coloring frame by frame, as while his first hand-colored movie was done in 1897 ("L'Hallucination De l'Alchimiste"), he wouldn't attempt to make another one until 1903, when the hand-colored movies done by Edison's Studios became to be as popular as his films.
What happened to the glory days of CN, back when they had a few cartoons shows.
There are two things that go through my mind when I watch My Gym Partner's a Monkey: 1) It is a cartoon 2) Comedy.
One of my favorite episodes is, when the animals from Charles Darwin School, stayed at Adam's house for the night.
I really think it's funny when someone writes "I serious it Retarded of a cartoon."
and Lugosi not just shooting Karloff when he has the chance, the creepiest thing in the whole movie is that after marrying Lugosi's wife, Karloff now sleeps with his step-daughter.
Other highlights are the skin-flaying scene (really nasty) and the oddball black mass (where did all those people come from and how did they get to the mansion when the innocent young couple found it impossible to leave?)
I watched it for the first time when i was 10 and the whole way through me and my friend laughed so hard we were crying!
For example: Cooper hates Ben, because he is a natural leader and he had good ideas to survive, therefore they were fighting every time and they shoot each other when the daughter of Cooper one became into a zombie.
Other example: when the "militiamen" appear,they have fun shooting, torturing and burn the zombies (when there are 3 zombies hunded in a tree and the humans are laughing while they shoot to them).
The movie isn't very original, and it doesn't have anything that makes it so good, but when you watch it, you'll agree with me...
I was stoked when this movie came out and when I left the cinema I was satisfied with the end results.
Notably absent is the crummy acting and gags that have marred many zombie movies...I was 17 when this one was made and I don't recall it playing in theaters at the time.
In most modern horror movies, the men and woman start as equal, probably the men being the dominant, but when tragedy strikes, the women take charge and survive while the men die.
The original will always get credit, with all right, for being original but it it really lacks when it comes to acting, score, makeup etc.
I was wrong about this film when it was released in-1990, thinking it was just a lame-hijacking of George Romero's story by some moron.
Most people hated this remake, when it first came out (even i hated it).
However, I actually enjoyed this a lot more than I would have expected to, given that remakes usually don't cut the mustard - especially when the original was just fine to begin with.
The only epilogue in the ORIGINAL is that when the "posse" comes the next morning, they see Ben in the window.
With this film, there is No surprise, no drama, no fright and we're off to the start of what is a VERY unfulfilling film when all is said and done.
Yes... AFTER everything falls apart, and AFTER everything has gone from bad to worse, when the horror of it all is getting bad when they are ALL out there, THEN she just runs out there and gets away.
Problems arise, however, when more survivors emerge from the cellar and personalities begin to clash.
One time, when the rather ingenuous romantic lead, David Manners (UH!
Strangers must battle armies of zombies when they become isolated in a rural farmhouse.
After all, I was a poor college student who had to take prudent measures in order to ensure that I had beer money when its all said and done.
It was based on a best-selling mystery novel that did Tom Clancy-style business, at a time when post-war Euro mystery writers (like Maj Sjowall and Per Wahloo - remember them?)
That's when Hartmann was to face a firing squad for a murder that he didn't commit but was framed for it by the person who did!
Morand it's still a big surprise when he's finally exposed at the end of the movie.
Not in who the killer is but what he does when he sees that his act as a fine and upright German patriot and General, the youngest in the German Army at the time he committed his horrific crimes, is about to be exposed!
The same cannot be said of O'Toole who is in utter control for most of his time on the screen but turns psychotic when confronting a painting by Van Gogh that exemplifies the latter's madness and lets loose the madness of General Tanz.
This isn't a great film, but it manages barely to sustain the suspense of the murder investigation and when the suspense is in remission, General Tanz successfully soaks up the viewer's attention.
His cold icy demeanor serves him well as he kills prostitutes on the side to pass the time when he is not butchering thousands on the battlefield, which is wherever he happens to be.
O'Toole is at his very best when he is seen to be going mad while viewing a self-portrait of Vincent Van Gogh when the artist was in an insane asylum.
The lunacy of war on a grand scale, (since when is war not on a grand scale), is amply exposed in this one!
The year of release, the international cast and production, all misguided me when I sat to watch "the Night of the Generals", at night, on a French TV-channel (and it was a French-dubbed copy).
One of the scenes that has always stood out in my mind since first watching this film is the one near the end when Lugosi ties up Karloff.
I saw this film when it was first released and with its all-star cast, the lines were a block long at the 41st Street Sheridan Theater on Miami Beach.
Shariff is fine, but couldn't he even draw his gun when going into arrest the killer in Paris?
What is the point of being a general when corporals wish to remain corporals?"
It has a very clever (devilishly clever) theme - when is a murder considered heinous?
Grau does get some help from a French inspector Morand (Philippe Noiret) when the generals turn up in Paris.
Grau hears this and laughs it off calling the plotters traitors (which again makes us wonder when is a crime no longer a crime and a murder what it is supposed to be).
His "crazy music" sounds like an accompaniment to a marionette show that, when one thinks about it, isn't entirely inappropriate.
One night when you have time on your hand for an interesting 'Who-done-it' set during a war, this is your film.
That's when it gets additionally dramatic, the eye-witness said the murderer wore a German Officer's uniform, .
Even a day when the whole world is falling down around them.
The movie does a great job of making almost perfect copies of German material and when it gets to France even has a shot of tanks made up to look very much like Panthers, in addition to the many kubelwagons and schwimwaggons.
The reconstitution of the period is also fantastic, specially the scene of the madness of General Tanz in a block of Warsaw, when he burns and destroys many buildings.
But there is something about this movie in particular which makes you feel absolute JOY when watching it.
Even when Nini experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song, the lighting is bright and flat, no shadows intruding.
There is an obvious comparison to be made with Lloyd Bacon's "42nd Street," which had been made about 20 years before, featuring Ruby Keeler as a dancing sensation, a fresh-faced kid from the sticks who had come to New York to get into show business, who saves the show when the star fails--"You're going out there a kid from the chorus, but you've got to come back a STAR!!"
Jean Gabin's "Danglard" keeps running afoul of genital politics, but when he talks about the show he is more like Knute Rockne than like Julian Marsh.
I mean the producers spent so much resources to make all those costumes and setups, but when you see something like this, it just ruins the whole point.
The Russian Army outsmarted the Turkish Army when it crossed the Danube at night catching the enemy with their guard down and seizing Russia's 1st victory of the war.
They don't mute the environment when it is needed, and the explosion sounds still have the usual echo-shrieking effect.
When i first heard that this film is similar to "Nocnoj dozor" i was disappointed (when i finished watching "Nocnoj dozor" i was really very mad, because i didn't like it), but when i watched "Tureckii gambit" i understood that only thing similar in these two films is special effects (sure special effect were nice in "Nocnoj dozor" but surely not the plot").
The entertaining bit is when you realise that the costume that Varvara is wearing is all wrong for this moment in the film!
Harry-Potter-like effects when Fandorin goes into his memories, looks plain over-done to me.
This movie is for someone who enjoys a movie with beautiful scenery and gripping effects (when they are appropriate).
This is by far the best directed movie I have seen by Mani Rathnam (even better than Iruvar), mostly because the story flowed so smoothly and the subtle details that were present, especially when Rishi Kumar (Arvind Swamy) was kidnapped.
Finally in the end, when the exchange was supposed to take place between Wasim Khan and Rishi Kumar, the terrorist just give them clothes of Rishi Kumar, and Wasim Khan was immediately taken back, since the terrorist didn't keep up with their end of the deal.
Also when Roja, confronts Wasim Khan in jail, and asks him why he is trying to kill someone who is innocent, for his personal gain.
The best moment in the movie I believe is the moment, when one of the terrorist guard informs (Pankaj Kapoor) that they have refused to release Wasim Khan, and for the bad news he takes out the flag, and tries to burn it.
They feel uncomfortable around the pleasant yet strange man, and are eager to continue their tour of Hungary, when tragedy befalls Joan and Peter in an automobile accident and Verdegast and Peter are both forced to take her to the residence of Hjalmar Poelzig (Karloff), the very man Verdegast is expecting to drop in on.
It was one of Lugosi's few heroic roles, and as Verdegast we are never sure if he is a good guy or bad guy until the very end, when the two arch enemies have a climatic showdown, which is as poetic as justice can be.
I love the guy's passion when he is trying to save the flag from fire!!!
Acting is solid, especially from Pankaj Kapoor as the terrorist leader, but also from Arvind Swamy as Rishi (except perhaps when he goes into patriotic overdrive).
The story is pretty good when Reavis returns to the Arizona Territory with false documents in hand and starts to implement his plan to become the Baron of the whole territory after marrying Ellen Drew, the so-called Baroness de Peralta.
It seems that when the US got this land from Mexico, it promised to honor all existing land grants.
I saw the film when it was first released, and although I was rather young at the time, the story stayed with me for decades.
What is interesting about this fact is that when T.V.
James Addison Reavis (1843-1914) was an obscure veteran of the American Civil War (on the losing side) who drifted into the Southwest at the time when whites were settling that region, displacing Amerindians and Mestizos.
Some of the acting is so poor that I found myself laughing when there is no humor in the film.
Also i don't know Ayesha takia was hardly given any comic sequences when will Indian filmmakers realise that women (besides the seductress) can be funny tooo.
not only has he have to be insinuating himself through those arduous 93 minutes - he is also required to suffer from gall bladder removal, be fluent in hypnosis and in the art of being invisible to others in those daring final minutes when all is revealed.
This is one of those movies that keep you watching despite a sloppy screenplay - why, for God's sake, does Korvo (Jose Ferrer) first attempt to gain control of Ann Sutton's (Gener Tierney) mind in the middle of a cocktail party albeit in an empty room into which anyone could have wandered and why, when Tierney discovers the body of Ferrer's ex lover, do two guys turn up from nowhere and call the police.
But I didn't buy it for a minute when Korvo orders Ann around in a trance and then hypnotizes himself hours after major surgery.
Ferrer is excellent as the oily hypnotist, keeping his voice even when he was saying the most outrageous things.
Gene Tierney stars as Ann Sutton, the affluent and respectable wife of an eminent psychoanalyst, who finds herself in a fix when she's caught shoplifting.
Ann's relief is initially tempered by the suspicion that Korvo intends to blackmail her but when he disabuses her of that idea and gains her trust, she becomes a patient of his and he successfully treats her insomnia by using hypnotism before promising to give her treatment for her kleptomania.
However, when one of his ex-victims (who is coincidentally now one of Dr Sutton's patients) tells her what sort of man he is, she dismisses what's been said and totally ignores the warning.
It is an unusual film noir from Otto Preminger and his favorite leading lady, Gene Tierney, who had starred in his classic "Laura" and whom had just completed her maternity leave when production began on "Whirlpool".
An odd choice but Jose F. does a great job too...his hospital scene still makes me wince when he gets up from his bed!
(To the observant person, it also displays the flaws of her presentational acting style; as when she breaks down in a torrent of bitter tears, and looks up afterwards Â dry eyed and serene.
Although, by today's standards it perhaps doesn't carry the kind of psychological weight and dramatic punch that it did back when the film was made.
Perhaps influenced by the wave of films during the period that utilized the growing field of hypnotherapy the picture might have seemed a bit fresher when it was first released.
This BRASS EYE special PAEDO-GEDDON was swamped by complaints ( More on that later ) when it was broadcast in 2001 following a national debate around a possible " Sarah`s law " following the abduction and murder of school girl Sarah Payne .
I loved seeing when Josephine has to take out the woman in Venice, her shot in sight, and is moved to tears through the words that Marco speaks to her, truthfully, not in any terms that deem him as the boring "safe" character, but as her kind of salvation from a life that she's been forced into as a final alternative.
(Seems a little crucial as something of her personality that's skipped over, when made to seem like a big stepping stone by Jeanne Moreau's enigmatic character.)
when we see the ptaradactl fly over the herd of dinos in the opening sequence).
Regardless, all of that works pretty well until the film stumbles when the element of a woman is arbitrarily interjected, and Cooper finds himself falling in love with a hostage (blond Erna SchÃ¼rer, a classic beauty in every sense of the term) who has volunteered to lead the wayward tank crew back to German lines.
Another interesting moment comes when Cooper is allowed access to the body of his new lust-thang and the thought of his men, his mission, and the danger they are in causes a certain amount of post traumatic stress disorder coitus interruptus, much to the annoyance of his would be squeeze.
I found myself actually caring for these hideous creatures and cringed when one of them was injured.
I also like the fact that there is no sound when the meteor hits, but you hear the surge afterwards.
As for the film's visuals, I will say nothing about them because they speak for themselves when you see them.
Unfortunately, trouble is ahead for most of them, when a Carnotaur attacks, leaving most of the eggs more like raw omelettesÂ
I used to wonder if Disney were going to make a movie about dinosaurs and when they did, it wasn't a bad choice to combine GGI characters with real backgrounds.
I was impressed by the trailer and when I finally saw "Dinosaur" first time, I liked some parts, but overall I found the movie a little mediocre.
When we started to watch it, I thought that it was interesting, but after awhile, I really became focused into it, and so when it was over, I really was thrilled with it!
All this peace and prosperity ends spectacularly when a meteor shower devastates Lemur Island, and our animal heroes must flee.
It's cute, but with a very ordinary story; besides, there are some important errors here, specially in the beginning in the part of the meteor, when everything is destroyed in the Plio's island: That Impact would kill not only the lemurs,but also many of the dinos.
this film is hard to resist, I watch it like 24/7 it's an amazing even though the plot is thin, the animation and the cast were the best part of the film, this film is like greatest film ever because of how realistic it looks real including the meteor crash, even though if a remake was being made they had to thicken the plot a bit but still keep the magic this film holds and also add a bit more cast members because their were like only 10 real characters that actually spoke words when the rest were just roars and grunts, so adding more characters would be great, also when i watch this i forget the fact it's a Disney film because of the little amount violence and the fact there is no songs because that would make it quite a silly film so i'am glad that they put any songs on.
It also detracts from the illusion the film so effortlessly produces on the screen at the start; it all just becomes so standard an routine when it seemed to be so much more.
This was yet another example, when it came out in 2000, of the latest strides being made in animation, computer-or-otherwise.
I was also very touched by Aladar's attempts to save the old dinos, and although I'm a grown-up, I jumped in my seat when the carnotaurs emerged.
Bogie is fabulous as always (although he does hold his arms a bit like a primate when he walks), Leslie Howard is playing the watery romantic that Leslie Howard does best, Bette Davis's face actually doesn't frighten me for once (no offense Bette Davis fans, she's a great actress, but I first saw her in "The Nanny" and that is how I will always remember her).
The film takes place mostly in a gas station in the middle of the desert, and what starts out as a rather impromptu tale of romance turns into something more sinister when a gangster on the loose decides to hide out in the station, taking all of its occupant's hostage.
But it's not long before he runs into the aforementioned gangster, and the tensions are revved up when they all end up back at the gas station.
The film works chiefly because its characters are so well defined, and this pays dividends later in the film when their insecurities and motives begin to surface.
When Davis's mother moved back to France when she was a young child, she felt like everything in her heart moved there with her, leaving her an empty shell of herself living with her stern, purist father.
But there's a snag when a notorious gangster, Duke Mantee (Bogart), has to hold up at the bar with his fellow gangsters and holds everybody hostage while they wait.
This doesn't stop the drama from unfolding, however, nor the talk about wealth and power, first with old man at the bar and then when an upper-class couple who got stranded in a sandstorm come in and also get in on the conversation.
I enjoyed how these three strutting 'vigilantes' are completely at a loss when actually confronted by Mantee.
The best part of the film, to me, was Bette Davis, who I have found very alluring when she was young.
As usual, "Bogie,"" was riveting when on screen.
She explains that she was in Europe and offered a stage role by the great Max Reinhardt, but acquiesced to her parents when they demanded she return to the states.
Squier is a "tourist afoot", hiking his way across the desert to the Pacific Ocean, when he finds himself in an out of the way diner populated by it's owner Jason Maple (Porter Hall), daughter Gabby, Gramp Maple (Charley Grapewin) and an itinerant gas jockey named Boze (Dick Foran).
Squier's presence deflates the ego of Gabby's would be boyfriend Boze, who effectively delivers the film's defining comment when viewed in retrospect - "Everybody's entitled to their own way o' thinking".
On the other hand, Chisholm's chauffeur Joseph is typecast as the subservient employee, who has to ask permission to have a drink when offered by Slim.
Davis was top billed each time over Bogey; oddly Bogart usually wound up in supporting roles in most of his Warner Brothers films when teamed with fellow contract players Davis, James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson.
He would play mostly gangster roles in Cagney and Robinson films with the odd lead in a "B" picture such as "Black Legion" (1937) until 1941 when he became a major star after appearing in "High Sierra" and "The Maltese Falcon".
Actually I watched it when I was very young with my Mom and it scared me!
The remainder of the film is when Duke Mantee and his gang take refuge at the filling station and hold captive anyone who's there or wanders in.
I had just finished reading a long, thorough history of World War I when I saw this one and even though this is some twenty years after that awful catastrophe (all wars usually are, but this one especially), one can still feel it's aftershocks rolling through that desolate landscape.
All of their fun comes to a screeching halt when Dina discovers that she is pregnant.
The action begins when the couples meet for the first time.
Further, Dina speaks so casually when she narrates and no one screams when they are victimized (except for when Maria and Paul argue over cutting Dina's belly open).
It seems as if the musical cues that lead up to these big moments (like when Paul first attacks Ron) lead up to nothing because the tension is lost when important events happen.
Foreshadowing should cause tension in a thriller, but foreshadowing is lost when Dina says what is going to happen next.
There is good parallel action placing Dina and Ronnie versus Maria and Paul and there is a good arch for each of the characters in which they change when their sight is narrowed in on their desires.
The most exciting scene is when Paul taunts Maria to cut open Dina's belly.
Jeffrey Donovan was very convincing as the young yuppie: self-assured and condescending, protective of his wife and wealth and ruthless when things got out of hand.
And when, at the start of their meeting with the other couple, she tries to win them over with a performance of a sweet mother-to-be, she's equally convincing; and likewise when she later on in the movie is under heavy attack and has to fear for her life, so to me it proves that she's a great actress too.
Then in the end Peter just says it's "time to go" when all along they've been going no where and in no hurry.
I just rediscovered this show that I used to watch when I was in elementary school and have to say that it's held up really well.
It is hard to believe now but there was a time when, if you were a 'Dr.Who' fan, you kept quiet about it.
Rose and Mickey are out Christmas shopping when a brass band wearing Santa Claus suits suddenly goes berserk, attacking the crowd with weaponry disguised as musical instruments.
If only he had been here in the '80's when we needed him!
At the end, when he selects his new clothes and sits down to turkey dinner with the Tylers, its as if he had always been there.
The first sign that Lover's Prayer was going to be a loser was when I realized that the people who were supposed to be Russian were speaking with British accents.
In movie showed that he was beside her when she was in throes of dead.
In the long term perspective we often make stupid choices when we act like that.
'The Scarlet Pumpernickel' was an exciting all-star experience when I was a kid and it remains a remarkable piece of work when I witness it as an adult.
Yet another good thing about this episode, is the clever, brilliant mux-ip of the modern and the old Daffy Duck (this episode was made in 1950, when the new greedy, sly, mean Daffy Duck that most of us know was just starting to appear) and the choosing of so many Looney Tunes characters - including a new one!
It is passionate when needed and suspense when called for.
John Cassavetes had one of the harshest styles of any independent director in film history; his close-ups can be out of focus, wavering, mostly hand-held, and his DP probably had only enough lights depending on when Cassavetes could get the dough for them.
Even when a moment could be dull or uninvolving, Gazarra makes us involved, without calling attention to his emotions in obvious ways.
Who are you, Louis XIV, who announced menacingly, "I nearly waited" when his lackey came running up exactly at the prescribed time?!?!
If you donÂ´t cry when you watch this movie, you must have a heart of stone.
To be honest, I disliked the film when I first saw it.
I understand that audiences stormed out of the cinema during and after the film during a couple of initial screenings when the film was finished.
In "Reservoir Dogs", a character is shot in the stomach, he bleed so profusely that his entire shirt and the back seat of a car is completely drenched in blood, and a character states that the stomach is one of the most painful areas to be shot, whereas in THIS film, we don't see a single speck of blood on Cosmo aside from a very tiny spot of blood on his green shirt, when returns home and lies on a bed, except for the very last scene of the film, where it looks like red paint was spilled on his jacket, which begs the question, why didn't any character notice beforehand, including the viewers??
Its only when he's on screen that the film is alive and gains some sense of purpose... even with an underdeveloped character and questionable directing Carey manages to create a lasting impression.
***SPOILER ALERT*** It's when nightclub owner Cosmo Vitelli, Ben Gazzara, finally paid off his debt to the local loan shark Marty, Al Ruban, is when his troubles really began.
Actor and good friend Ben Gazzara at first turned down Cassavettes in taking the part of the doomed Cosmo Vitelli but when he was told by Cassavettes that it in fact was really about himself he did it as a favor to him.
However, when I see a film that deals with the human condition... with everyday people, I much prefer a realistic perspective into their world.
People talk over one another, they mumble, they cease to speak when you expect to hear them...
As weird as it sounds, you have to respect someone like that, even when he finds himself increasingly trapped by circumstances and succumbing to self-doubt.
Cassel and Gazarra are two of those actors whose names you won't recognize, but when you see their faces, you'll recognize them.
I like movies like Silence of the lambs (even if it isn't as thrilling and suspense now as it was when it came out) or Kiss the girls.
Remember, it make your eyes pop up, and head ache, but when it ends you wanna watch it again.
This film should be enjoyed by those who can take a slight headache when figuring out who did it.
THE BS scene:- The woman's old house was burned when she's a kid, may be not burned down but definitely burned bad.
Then, when attacked in a dark alley by the murderer in a car, while the murderer is threateningly -- but patiently -- gunning the engine in neutral apparently waiting for the cop to decide where to run, the cop runs straight for a fence, and the inevitable man-climbs-fence-while-chased-by-car scene, instead of calmly stepping back through the OPEN DOOR into the brick building he just came out of.
The whole film lumbers and creaks and when finally it gets to its first surprise ending, believe me it is not a surprise, it's pretence and over use of slow motion is irritating rather than dramatic.
After this the audience is left bored and uninterested when the killer/victim leaves and lines up her next victim, imagine Basic Instinct on Valium.
However, it's pleasant - it still makes for a worthwhile watch on TV, and predictably - of course the best moment is when they finally are together after all.
And then there's a further nod to another thriller, Kiss the girls (1997), where the idea of a deadly duo is raised and then quashed when a prime suspect is himself reduced to a jumble of parts in a bag.
Exhibit A: cop finds out his pretty but sulky witness has attempted suicide several times, turns around and leaves her alone in his flat with his one and only gun, then goes after a serial killer without any weapon, gets mauled in the process, survives the ordeal, chases the killer a second time, this time still without any weapon... And just when you think it can't get any dumber than this, well, that's exhibit A, and as Picard puts it, "Plenty of letters left in in the alphabet"  A thinking person's movie?
I suspect a lot of people who spend their working hours thinking actually like to switch off their brains when they come home after a hard thinking day's work.
Doubtless other viewers will predict the plot points with superhuman speed...still, I enjoy the spectacle even when I'm mystified.
It gives new life to any old, tired story or scenario Â better still when it's harsh and good-looking and violent and surprising, like this.
Nor do we know why that eerie painting did not raise the attention of the police when the knew good and well a head would turn up next.
Therefore, when Amanda runs into a Hollywood tour bus guide, Harold (Jeremy Piven) at a bar-for-the-stars, she is excited to learn that he is also a screenwriter!
It seems that Su-Yeon has actually killed her lovers based on her sexual trauma with her obsessive father, but if this premise is correct, why Seungmin had the aggressive attitude when the detectives arrive in the hospital?
2 hours later the mother is brutally dead & of coarse the young man is convicted & sent to prison for trial   all along he keeps sayin he had an alibi by a scientist doctor who gave him a lift by his car that particular night   but that witness was no where to be found & after a while the son was hanged the flash backs are over  back to reality where miss marple & the family of 5 children , their father & his fiancÃ©e ( miss marple's friend ) are happily spending the evening doing sharades & hanging around so Merrily  when a scientist doctor spots an old newspaper & reads that a young man was hanged due to killing his mom 2 years ago he comes in a rainy night to this family's night to reveal a dark secret   appearing like a ghost out of the windows where they all gathered & telling them that their long dead brother was with him around 8,30 which is the same time of the murder of their dead mother taking place , so there is no way he was the murderer & they all discover that if their dead brother isn't the one , so it's one of them  & the mystery goes on & on & gets more thrilling & full of surprises i love reading , i would support novels brought to movies , novels are harder than a 90 minutes screen adapted novel to some people ,though novels are more deep full of details & depth that no way a movie can deliver  but on the other hand a movie is easier to understand for young people, easier to watch especially for a whole new generation of Agatha Cristie's young fans  back to the movie ... i think it's done very well , miss Geraldine's acting is always awesome i love the way she does it .. the acting , her custom's ,the way she always repeat the word '' dear'' in many lines in the script makes u feel like she 's ur own granny lol  the casting of the family was wonderful & very suitable , the 2 sisters Kirsten & Hester are wonderful actors especially the younger one kirsten , she is a very sensible actress , the brothers jacko ( the thought to be murderer of his mother is wonderful ), the other brothers were so right in their own places , the lake where a suicide takes place was original ,the house & the stormy weather helped much in the belief of the realism   i don't think the movie is crap on the contrary i think if u r free for the weekend & it's on TV try catchin it or rent it if available , u'll enjoy
Isn't it FRAUD to name it "Agatha Christie's Miss Marple," when it has nothing to do with her books?
It's so darn unbelievable when it unfolds.
However, this takes a terrible turn when a man comes to their house and gives them evidence that Leo Argyle couldn't commit his mother's murder.
Father Leo is a fumbly, mumbly, mamby-pamby idiot with no spine who can't even bring himself to stand by his fiancÃ© and show faith when doubt is cast on her.
Both Swayze and De La Pena were wonderful dancers in their prime but to be only 7 years away from professional dancing as stated in this film is frankly, a bit ridiculous when it is obviously many more years than that - more like 20.
It was awesome to watch the dancing and for me to think that both Lisa and Patrick were in their early 50's when this was shot, is amazing to me.
I get emotional when I watch the dance because it is so beautiful.
20 years ago, when we were coming up through the ranks, it was a lot different than it is now.
I'm talking about a time when a person was so dedicated, so disciplined that they would do anything, overcome anything to make their dreams happen and sometimes almost destroying themselves in the process.
I am not even exaggerating when I say that it really is possible that this is the worst show that has ever been put on TV.
His countenance and his boyish body language when he would be around her was so wonderful to watch.
His films are beautiful, even when the story is a bit obtuse.
OK -- i had to hide from my parents to watch this when I was 12 -- and I think it's why I have what my friend calls "RSS" Rock Star Syndrome!!
I was 13 in 1979 when I first saw this movie and it really made an impression on me.
I loved this movie when I first saw it on TV in 1979 (at age 11) and it remains a favorite.
I truly enjoyed this film when I saw it back in 1978, the scene of Jesse eating a whole chocolate cake is so true to how someone her age might react when she had her heart broken, it was soo funny.
Saw it when I was a teenager and fell in love with Rex.
I remember watching this television movie when it first came out back in '79 starring sexy Rexy (Rex Smith)and Denise Miller (later of "Archie Bunker's Place").
I don't know what it was, maybe cause I was 18 when I saw the film and a Letta us guys had girlfriends (or were in love with girls) that were a fies years younger and it just didn't fit in back then (mostly with the fathers) and the movie kinda made it feel better for us, made us all feel like we were OK and that the feelings were real and OK, I was overwhelmed at the time, being in a relationship with a girl that was 16, it helped me sort it all out.
I saw this movie when it first came out, and was obsessed with it.
I bought it and watch it every now and then when I want to escape to a simpler, less complicated time, with slumber parties, "Teen Beat" posters on the walls, vinyl records scattered about, slurping on NON-diet sodas and talking with my friends about boys and music and boys!
I hadn't seen the movie in about 20 years when I found it on Amazon, and the first time I replayed it...I STILL knew all the songs.
I LOVED this movie when it was on TV.
I can't imagine the 13-year old girls of today not watching this movie, and not feeling like I did when I saw it for the first time.
I know that when you watch it several things are definitely 70's, but still..he's Rex and he's eternally hot!
I first seen this film in the early 80's and i loved it, its a real tearjerker and any chick flick fans out there will surely enjoy this film, i never get bored watching this film, but get the box of tissue's at the ready :)  Rex plays the part of a 17 year old guitar instructor named Michael and a 13 year old girl named Jessie falls for him, she manages to get his attention and they fall in love, he thinks she's 16 years old as thats what she told him, but you'll have to watch the movie for yourself to see what happens when Michael finds out Jessie's real age, a highly recommended film.
I must say I saw the movie when I was 15 and it was on late at night.
It's because of what it was about and when we saw it, I'm guessing!
I saw this film when I was just a teenager and I loved it.
Jessie, although only 13, isn't treated like a baby, even when she messes up.
I loved this movie when it came out.
I remember watching this movie when I was 13, and now that I am older, for some reason I just HAD to have this movie on DVD.
I am sure there are guys who can relate but the trilogy of books and the movie just go hand and hand with us girls when we were teens!
Saw this movie on re-run just once, when I was about 13, in 1980.
Being 39 and realizing how much has changed since those simpler '70s times when girls of 13 actually did take buses and go to malls together and had a lot more freedom away from the confines of modern suburbia makes me sad for my daughter Â who is nearly 13 herself.
Re-watching Sooner or Later has me absolutely sick with nostalgia for those simpler times, and has triggered a ridiculous and sudden obsession with catching up with Rex Smith Â whom while I enjoyed his albums Sooner or Later and Forever when I was young, I never plastered his posters on my walls as I did some of my other faves.
During those moments when the world is spinning around, I have to laugh because they look like those old "newspapers spinning towards the camera" shots showing a series of headlines, e.g.
I also like the dialogue between Kirk and Spock in the briefing room when they finally put all of the pieces of the puzzle together.
I'm giving "The Alternative Factor" a D grade and will find an alternative episode to watch when I can.
But I did catch the movie when it appeared on network TV a few years later.
So when I decided to take another look at it, I thought maybe I misjudged it.
The one part I really enjoyed was when Snoopy is captured by the crazy Clara.
I was 16 when it was released.
I wouldn't have admitted it when I was younger but the scenes between Lila & Snoopy plus Charlie & The kids saying good-bye at Snoopy's farewell party did make me sad.
One of the funniest parts for me is when Lucy and Snoopy box with each other (Snoopy putting the boxing glove on his nose LOL).
Even now I still get choked up at the farewell party and Chuck's sad song when Snoopy leaves home.
I actually had to stop my tape once when that scene came up because I was crying so much.
I still dance a bit to the scene when Snoopy and Woodstock have a little concert while they set up camp and make dinner and YES!
Some of these songs are quite good, like Fundamentalfriendependability, the song sung by a girl who captures Snoopy when he is en route.
This is the last sad part in the movie thank God, because when I'm watching it I cant manage to watch the whole movie with dry eyes.
One of my favorite parts is when Peppermint Patty and Charlie Brown are at the amusement park and are talking about love and Charlie touches Patty's hand.
No wonder I always get upset when see somebody kick someone in the leg like Snoopy did to Linus,etc.
I liked the part when Charlie Brown said "It took that rock 5,000 years to come to shore, now your putting it back".
I remember watching it many dozen a time when I was between the age of 4-6.
The few things I don't like about this movie are when Linus and Snoopy hurt each other, the boxing match sequence with Lucy and Snoopy and, of course, the sequences with "the terrorist" (a real trauma for Snoopy and Woddstock) and most parts with Lucy.
The following day, when Snoopy tries to go to the beach to see Peppermint Patty again as promised, suddenly a sign has been put up saying that dogs are not allowed on the beach.
This starts a chain reaction that begins a string of frustration within Snoopy...  More snubbing comes from other members of the Peanuts gang when what started off as being a bit of fun with Linus and his security blanket soon turns sadistic and nasty, once again with Snoopy on the losing end.
Eventually, however, Snoopy and Woodstock reach the hospital where Lila is staying, and her spirit does indeed rise when the dog suddenly appears by her bedside and enriches her enthusiasm.
I first saw this film as a boy in my early tens, and even when I watch it now it has lost none of its ability to endear and -- in particular -- choke.
I remember this Peanuts movie-special, along with A Boy Named Charlie Brown, fondly as a kid, when they replayed these specials on Nickelodeon (or it might have been Disney's channel, can't remember which).
"Peanuts" managed to speak to me when I was a child and it continues to do so now that I'm an adult.
I was a 21 year old working as a projectionist in a neighborhood theater when this film was released and I had the opportunity to help get it up on the screen.
Another minor problem I feel, is that many of the philosophical concepts were overtly and therefore unnecessarily stated, when the story itself should have been allowed to put forward these concepts.
I also could not help but imagine how a film depicting the events in Iraq and the Mideast during the period of the 1990's into the present circumstances, will appear to viewers when it is seen and commented upon, at a site such as this, say, around 2050 or 2060.
Generally, I thought that Peter Redgrave as Fowler (a middle aged, jaded British journalist) and Audie Murphy as "The American" put on pretty decent performances, I appreciated the look (somewhat limited but still present) at Vietnamese culture, and I also appreciated the portrayal of the very early years of the Vietnam War, when it was still the French dealing with a Communist insurgency in what was then an integral part of their Empire.
When it was over I was reminded of Hemingway's comment when he was asked his opinion of the film version of "The Snows of Kilimanjaro": "it was okay except for one difference; in my story the protagonist dies, and in the film he lives."
It was filmed on location in Saigon, very unusual for the time when most films like this were filmed in the studio.
A British journalist named Fowler (Michael Redgrave) befriends him, but soon their friendship is damaged when the young American has an affair with Fowler's Vietnamese mistress.
Not quite what Greene had in mind but relevant to events in the USA during the McCarthy era when this film was made (1958).
I have to laugh when Dean tries to explain why he looks nothing like the real police officer, whose identity he's stolen.
I really enjoy Dean when he's all over protective of Sammy.
Great great episode, i wondered when are they gonna make a tribute to movies like 'Wrong Turn' and 'Hills Have Eyes', and they really delivered it with 'The Benders'.
I liked the open scene when Kathleen kills the father of the Benders; it is not explicit, and each viewer is allowed to have his or her own interpretation.
I am in love with this film...when i was younger (18 or so) I saw this movie for the first time late night on a "premium" cable channel and loved it...it was adventurous and foreign.
That doesn't downgrade the late Mr. Milligan at all-- no doubt when he was putting together plays in the 1950s, much of the aesthetic seen in VAPORS and FLESHPOT ON 42nd STREET was already intact.
If VAPORS was reminiscent of early Warhol, when Andy himself was at the camera, FLESHPOT is reminiscent of the Paul Morrissey era.
We can accept one or two extremely implausible events if the story requires it, but when near-impossible events happen again and again, with a new one each few minutes, credibility crumbles.
This may be the best softcore erotic movie ever made, and its a shame that more people didn't see it in America when initially released in 1975 at the height of the Sexual Revolution, before AIDS came along and took all the fun out of swinging.
Specifically, when a person has multiple impale wounds that go right through her torso?
Especially when you consider that this is a straight-to-video flick.
Having seen ARRIVAL II and SPECIES II, I was prepared for the absolute worst, and I could not believe my eyes when this sequel turned out to be... well... decent.
I had seen Mimic when it originally came out and didn't remember it all that fondly.
The science here is weak (and accounts for the one glaring continuity error when Remy explains what DNA went into the Judas breed) but the plot doesn't hinge on science.
Segonzac still achieves an alienating gloom beneath all of the camp, and the film is routinely suspenseful--it's difficult to not be suspenseful when you're dealing with bugs.
It reflects the brilliance of the supernatural team when even during the most tense and saddening finale, they can still manage to inject some humour to keep things from becoming emo sad.
The relationship between the brothers has become so deep that it is a real shock to the system when anything this horrible happens to one, or really both of them.
Without any lead, he meets Bobby and calls Ash; later, Ash calls Dean and when they arrive in the Roadhouse, they find the place burned to the ground, Ash and other hunters dead and Ellen missing.
They also find new special children, Lily- who stops peoples hearts when she touches people and Jake- who seems to have super strength.
When love always wins, the love b/w Rehan and Zooni wins only when a mortal sacrifice is made.
The expressions on Kajol face when she meets Rihan after having here eyes in her house not knowing him are also very good, the illusion she has is nicely filmed.
The story is good but the way it was handled....I cringed when an intelligent actress like Kajol is made to do those heavy-duty unrealistic emotional scenes so associated with Bollywood that we thought its passe now.
Then the next 10, the story took a turn and i was like maybe I will live through the movie and not go to rehab or bang my head against the wall..but that's when it goes downhill again.
Eye of the needle is so good that you support the bad guy, and when he's about to die you feel bad for him.. here i felt bad for myself all the people who had actually paid to watch this crap...they need to pay us back and pay for our visits to the therapist...
The only good number is within the first hour and not when I needed it the most.
They were superb individually and when they were together it was even better.
Some of Aamir's best moments were when he was with Kajol, and vice versa.
I'm not a movie expert but I know when there's something to watch, and something to just pass by, and this movie here, after reading the comments peaked my interest, but once I got the movie playing it was a totally different thought.
This was 40 minutes I will never get back, so take it from me, when facing the chance to watch something else vs. this movie, then take something else.
the script of Fanaa has some mistakes for sure,but when you watch Aamir and Kajol together you just forget and forgive!
But, when you get to the point where you're nearly stalking a neighbor who clearly doesn't want to be your friend- how can most of us relate to that?
Later on, when the schoolteacher sees Tina on her cigarette break at work, she doesn't let on that they're neighbors.
Melanie is every bit as calculating as her colleague Thorsten in this respect; she knows that the right time to insinuate yourself in somebody's life is when the person is at their most vulnerable.
Ridiculously, she brings home-warming presents to people in her apartment building when she moves in.
Melanie tries to win the friendship of the owner of a fashion boutique by buying expensive clothing that she probably can't afford, helps her with cleaning up her apartment, only to get coldly rejected when due to a misunderstanding she dis-invites the boutique owner's boyfriend.
at least shoot 24p..." But soon enough, the story sucked me into Melanie's plight settling into a new environment, struggling with loneliness, desperation, and upholding her facade of "everything is fine," when everyone knows that she is physically and emotionally deteriorating.
I have to begin by saying that I am an avid B-movie fan, especially when it comes to sharks.
It's good to know that now a days, when the movie running time is too short, its OK to show clips from previous parts of the movie.
The only time is was OK for anyone to put a growling noise against a shark was at the end of Jaws when they played an old dinosaur roar for the sinking great white after it had been blown-up.
I respect his work, but I think he was rolling over in his grave when they wrapped on this pickle.
And in the scene, when the navy aircraft lands on water, the sea is flat, the sun shines and you can see land.
Who would design a research platform that when exposed to some trauma where the life support was cutoff would require the occupants to swim outside to engage the back up life support?
My favorite exchange occurs when the hull of the sub/underwater station is compromised.
Many are shot in close up and appear to be acting in completely different scenes, even when they're having interactions.
But it chocked me mysteriously that when the female star decided to go "to help" the poor people that were actually being eaten by the sharks outside, the producer magically omitted the at least half and hour or more that takes to change into a diving suit.
Jump forward five years & an underwater scientific research laboratory called the Oceania is conducting experiments in the area when they notice an increase in Shark numbers & activity.
The script is awful, it starts off like some cheap alien film set in outer space but then when it switches to Earth things just go from bad to worse, if the US government knew that a spaceship crash landed in the Ocean why couldn't they find it?
Why wasn't that submarine equipped for an underwater rescue when everyone knew that's exactly what needed to happen?
Star Wars: film opens with alien space ship passing before camera   The Abyss: incidental appearance of nuclear attack submarine unfriendly commando(s) underwater research station aliens at the bottom of the ocean Operatic music when aliens appear husband and wife together in underwater base   Deep Blue Sea: smart sharks that are team players   Jaws: the beach scene, including water-level camera angle   Jaws2: aircraft gets attacked by shark   Alien: blue collar crewmen, sassing the female boss   Aliens Pvt Hudson & the unwilling tech guy ("Game over man", vs. "I'm not going out there")   The Black Hole cowardly dude gets what's coming after stealing the escape pod  Leviathan: sunken cargo ship with dangerous cargo symbolical breaking to helpless support ship  and lots, lots more.
Fearless leader, who suspects the health inspector is from the CIA, which is obviously your first choice when thinking about groups of really mean guys Sub Captain, who lets any old health inspector aboard his nuclear attack vessel, without making that phone call to check up on them, first.
The module contains a material which, when mixed with something (Deuterium?)
I barely could stop laughing when the female diver tries to find her missing friends and somehow calls their names and communicates with the base.
Her treatment of the dying Johnny when she couldn't even bring herself to visit him in hospital seemed especially harsh but Fanny suffered from her own demons which seemed to torment her constantly.
But the music should fit the movie, not just be eerie all the time, even when the "eerie" moment is long gone.
A young cat (a clear prototype for Jones's cloying early character Sniffles) takes over the post of night watchman when his father is too ill to carry out the job.
Of course, the cat finally turns the tables when his conscience buoys him up for a big final showdown.
Eternally entrancing firebrand actress Yvette Mimieux scores her best, strongest, most commanding and effective role to date as a smart, classy, fiercely self-sufficient no bulls**t Los Angeles businesswoman who runs afoul of psycho hicks and rapist redneck cops when she goes down South during her cross country trek from California to New York.
Loren Newkirk's melancholy, harmonica-heavy, nicely down-home country score, the often razor-sharp dialogue (when Yvette tells Jones to be careful when he faces off with the pigs at the film's thrilling conclusion, Jones responds with this choice fatalistic retort: "I was born dead anyway"), the unsparingly bleak and harsh downbeat nightmarish tone, and especially Bruce Logan's agile, polished cinematography (the use of hand-held camera for Jones' climactic face-off with the law really does the stirring trick) are all also highly impressive.
"September Affair" was a film that stayed in our mind when we first watched it a long time ago.
I saw this movie when I was up late.
Like a lot of youth back then, when I was young, when this picture was made and today; these kids are bored.
He tries to make them shuck their boyish illusions about outlawry, but when push comes to shove the kids can't do it.
The Spikes Gang was made back in the days when Ron Howard was your prototypical golly gee whiz teenager, just a number of months after American Graffiti, and in the same year which Howard's TV sitcom Happy Days premiered.
The coming of the talkies is often looked on as a sad time, when silent stars were washed up, stalwart filmmakers tried and failed to fight the change, and movies in general became a little awkward.
For example, when Cooper and co. first meet Mary Brian, the train she is on keeps chugging along, keeping some constant movement in the shot.
But Fleming is wise enough to know when to calm things down, and indeed the more sedate scenes have a greater impact after the usual flurry of action.
Owen Wister (1860-1938) was a classmate and close friend of Theodore Roosevelt and when the book came out in 1902 it was dedicated to the new president who was in his second term of office.
I've been a Joan fan for a while now, so when I saw the laser disc for this movie I got it right away.
Gary Cooper delivers, with a formidable supporting cast, an excellent performance which struck a cord with audiences who had seen it way back when.
Yes........Remembering when there was a time that television at least was making an attempt at being adventurous and exciting.
Konkona is nice, but when compared to her previous work, it's definitely not in that league.
)when her parents forcefully try to marry her to Mohan (Ranvir).
This guy speaks from his eyes and when he says "Chai bhi aapki main bhi aapka he moves the screen; Vinay pathak looks cute and definitely acts well.
I wonder what grumpy pill he took when he watched this or maybe he just isn't a romantic guy.
The director showed that even when a man is "jilted at the alter", he can forgive his love even after 11 years apart.
There were times when they dragged the scenes a bit long.
The movie is fantastic.An excellent comeback from Madhuri after 5 years.The story is brilliant.It opens when Dia a dance teacher works in USA with her family.One day she gets a call that her dance instructor is dead.And wants her to come back to Ajanta.She comes back.The old Ajanta is being converted to a shopping mall.Its now dia turn to save this.At the end she does a few dances which attracts peoples.She wins their hearts.An enjoyable family movie.Madhuri was superb.Divvya was superb.Konkana was superb.Kunal looked hot and was awesome.Irfan was superb.Akshaye was wonderful.Ranvir Vinay add humour and were funny.Direction is wonderful.Cinematography is excellent.Chereography is wonderful.The music is faboulous and superb.The lyrics are wonderful and so is the picturisations.A must see Rating-10/10
She returns to India after several years when she hears the news of her dying guru.
Political play comes in when a new mall is proposed to be built replacing the history old art centre.
The first thing my dad did when the credits were done rolling (do stay through the end of the credits because they don't tie up a storyline until then), was to pat me on the back and say thank you for pushing him to come see Aaja Nachle because he hadn't seen such a good film in a long time.
And, of course, when they told the story of Laila and Majnu as kids, with her feeling every pain he had and the world tearing them apart, my heart went awwwwwwwwwwwww (not mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm this time).
That last one when the play concluded was just gorgeous.
However, when one considers the parade of human failure and misery that willingly allows itself to be showcased in a weekly strip's worth of Jerry Springer episodes, Waters' Dreamlanders, not only in "Maniacs," but in "Flamingos," "Female Trouble," and "Desperate Living" too, come off as a misfit bunch of lovable zanies.
But just when you think that this film is different from all other of John's films, a giant lobster appears out of nowhere (and for no reason), named "Lobstora", and it rapes Divine.
Yeah life sucks when you are young and if you focus on that life will always suck.
The story is interesting, showing how a group of close friend perceive the world in very different ways when on acid and not.
I watched this with my family when I was 12, because we lived in a town with one theater that showed one movie, and only on the weekends.
Ever since I saw this movie when it first came out, I have loved it.
It is so sweet, and realistic when it comes to the terrible reality of the modern-day slaves: prostitutes.
People tend to be hard on films like these when writing a review because they think every film must be deep and intellectual.
When I first watched "Milk Money", I initailly squirmed when V and Tom were talking.
Another point people might squirm is when a mother thinks Tom and V are brother and sister, and mentions to her children them as a good example.
It's an overreaction, but there is truth when the father blames (wrongly) Tom for turning his son into a pig.
I own it and have seen it many times and always feel really good when it ends.
To be honest, this is one of the movies I thoroughly enjoyed when I first watched it.
Helping the son of the bloke she has taken a shine to pass his school-biology presentation her past life catches-up when a former client recognises Melannie & demands her services.
It's a classic boy meets girl movie with that dash of "damsel in distress but is now hardened and tough due to life being so rough and who now finally meets a man who breaks through it all and understands and loves her for who she is" - as far as romantic comedies go- it was better then I thought it would be and even gets the heart strings welling when Ed Harris tells her "this could hurt"...The story itself can be at times almost childish, but in the end that's part of it's charm.
I saw "Milk Money" when I was eleven; much of what happens in the movie is the sort of stuff that would make any eleven-year-old boy think "Whoa...cool!"
I cried a lot when i watched this movie in the theater I was crying the whole time but enjoyed it a lot!
Particularly when Shah Rukh leaves the hospital to go convince Saif and Priety, I was very uneasy.
Just until the end, when you can't hold back the tears any longer.
Anyone can relate to this story, even the stone hearted will cry to the highest level when they see this.
The film is interesting and flows well, and then suddenly from nowhere comes Aman (Shahrukh), a happy-go-lucky guy who seems to have no problems in life, but he does want to solve the problems in Naina's family when he meets the rather complicated girl, whom he falls in love with the first moment he sees her.
Aman tries to get close to her and then, when she finally understands she is in love with him, he rejects her!
Note the scene when Naina tells Rohit about loving Aman and his expressions.
There may be times when you are in the mood for a story about someone without the modern "I,Me,Mine" attitude, about someone who knows that the real meaning of love often carries with it the need for making sacrifices and may mean caring more about the other person's needs than your own.
W0w, This movie is great, I watched just bit of it when it released, It was real sad, that I couldn't finish it, but now after about 1 year I determined to watch it no matter what, and I really loved it.
I fear when the next poorly delivered line would come.
And Farah Khan plays her usual magic with the choreography, especially for the song Kuch to Hua Hai, which will keep you giggling in your seat...  Now the loopholes: Why do all Caucasian looking people in America speak Hindi (with an awful accent as well), especially when some of the Indians sometimes afford to speak English!!??!!
Why, when Saif and Preity find out about Shah Rukh, they both seem more worried about their love lives than their friend's....well...LIFE!!!
It was like watching Mary Poppins when I was 6 yeras old, during 3 hours I lost the total terms of reality!!!!
I was very disappointed with the music when it was first released.
I know KHNH is a good movie when I first read the premise, but I don't realize that this is a very good movie.
Having said that, this was possibly the most interesting Bollywood movie I've seen to date - especially in its attempt to incorporate elements of Western pop culture, including several blatant references to American movies, from Grease and a spoofed James Bond to Brad Silberling's City of Angels, which evidently contributed a lot to the way Shahruk Khan's character is handled (including him starting to see things in black and white when he is near dying - that one goes back all the way to Wim Wenders!).
We learn small things about Claire, such as when she was a child, she was forgotten at the beach by her family, or that when she was an adolescent, she used to cut herself to remind herself that she was living.
that we see him treat, potentially ferocious but sweet when asleep.
The big groups attack the small groups with stuff like this when they should be working together, isn't that what their little scripture book tells them to?
Super-glossy image, decent acting (though I find Sobieski pretty boring as a lead) and a good, minimalist music score can't do much when the clumsy screenplay has so many conveniences (the heroine seems to have a mysterious knack for being in the right place at the right time to see/hear/find everything she needs to piece the truth together).
See what I mean when I say confusion can set in easily unless things are sorted out???
At least that's what we assume when we first meet her.
Yet instead of happiness when they get back together, Rebecka and Jake face strange on-set violence, and off set murders begin happening.
This may be one that goes to television viewing when one has nothing to do in the evening.
Most of the movie consists of the serial killer movie -- not as it's being filmed, but as it plays in finished form, which is odd because it keeps switching back and forth between the serial killer movie and "reality," when the movie isn't finished yet.
Even when the movie is over her involvement in them is still up in the air and unexplained to the audience by the director and writer of the movie "Method".
However, all becomes tragic when people begin to turn up dead and Jake is arrested as a suspect.
I really hope that a 3rd series comes along soon and I also hope that the Americans when making their version do not miss the vital comic dark moments!
There are times when we find the characters unsympathetic, with the exception of perhaps Cathy and Terry but I personally think that was intended.
The main character Jill is a savagely cruel person, when her husband is diagnosed with cancer she drops him off at the hospital and goes to a dating agency to find a new man.
I thought he was going to scream and run away when guns started firing.
Trust me when i say that this show is a Godsend compared to the crap that comes on T.V.
After you've watched the first season, you'll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates Television, and no T.V show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos.
Even Carmella, his wife, when given a chance for a way out, finds that she really prefers life with Tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own.
Realism is present when it is needed, but Chase's decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for "dream episodes" and the like only adds more layers to the series.
A lot of characters have only appeared once, when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes - Tracee the dancer, Meadow's friend Ally, Uncle Junior's ladyfriend (supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1).
Prior to this she also squanders a million opportunities to escape or blab to the authorities, but instead chooses to make things difficult for herself by only trying to do eiterh of those things when nasty Stellan Skarsgard is around.
I've laughed at their wisecracks, been torn when they've made err in judgement, and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal.
She is the side of Tony that makes him listen to reason, that makes him decent, that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long, if ever.
Even when you hate a character, you hold back because they are so beautifully developed, you can almost understand why they react to frustration, fear, greed or temptation the way they do.
I will when the series ends, and I have collected all the DVD's, and put the collection in my will.
It should be a subject in school :) I saw Sopranos when I was a kid, but I was too young to stay waked until the episode ends, so now I bought the all Episodes in DVD format and I am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and I am getting addicted, like I did with Prison Break.
For me, I don't like when people refer to the show, a show about the Mafia.
Complex characters from stunning acting, magnificent story lines from brilliant writing, and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together?
All the things that come to my mind, when I think to David Lean, are reunited in this movie:  Bigger than life locations (here: Africa, Cambodia, Tchetchenia) Bigger than life love story (here, Lara's song has been changed into a piano theme) Bigger than life actors (Angelina shows another time all her talent) Bigger than life scenes (here, it's not a bridge which explodes)  So, if you like Doctor Jivago, Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge upon Kwai River, you will like this movie....   ...
But when her life is disrupted by a look at the "real" world through the eyes of a passionate and handsome man.
An aspect in homo sapiens somehow "needs" to "plan" not only the submission, but -- when necessary -- "beyond" the complete elimination of the others around.
I strongly recommend everybody see this movie - when my children are old enough, they will definitely be forced to watch it too.
Its nice when actors just disappear into a role :)  I cannot recommend this movie any higher...
About in the middle of the movie is when you can start to expect the glass's want the money.
I literally gasped out loud in the movie theatre when Jolie's character went up to the African child to rescue him from the vulture.
I think she is an excellent actress and I'm never bored when I see her on the big screen.
I'm wondering what those who voted less than 7 for this picture expected to see when they viewed this movie or even if they did see it.
I gave it a 10 and look forward to seeing it again when it comes out on video.
Are we meant to applaud Sarah (Jolie) for not wearing perfume after Nick's ridicule, even when we can see faint traces of mascara on her drooping eyelids as she broods in Chechnya?
Why not admire her for responding to Nick's impassioned plea for more funding at a dinner in London when her peers are cruel and apathetic?
Even when Nick later expresses his guilt over the little boy's death, I wonder if we are meant to feel sorry for him or the boy.
It is very sad that in every part of our life politic and high interest play the role, even when some human lives can be lost.
I did not know what to expect when I rented this DVD I was intrigued by the write up on the cover.
Reading an interview with Angelina Jolie inspired me when I was 17 years old to go into a life of service.
I will be joining the Peace Corps when I graduate college in 2006.
There were so many times when this movie could have fallen apart, devolved into nonsense, but it always holds together.
The Glass House was recommended to me by a friend when I first saw it.
I've read reviews of "Dark City" in many places (and many of them here) hailing it as a modern science fiction masterpiece, so boy was I disappointed when I watched it and came to the sober conclusion that it's just not very good.
At least this had an interesting story, but as befalls so many films in this mind-bending sci-fi genre (and "The Matrix" suffers from this as well, though it's a far better movie), the writers have set up such a cerebral concept that the movie grinds to a halt when it has to trudge through all the exposition just so that the audience can keep track of what's going on.
Alex Proyas may not direct many films but when he does he gets it right.
Bumstead and Emma seem distant at first because they are only just introduced to those lives when we first see them.
And when it starts, its a lot of fun.
Its a work of great imagination and packed a wallop when I watched it in an empty theater 6 years ago.
The special effects in Dark City are stunning and realistic, especially when certain characters use "tuning".
There is no need to have an evil little kid alien, or for the aliens to all chatter their teeth when they do something ominous.
How come his glasses don't fall off when he's hanging upside down?
Why does he speak haltingly, stutteringly, EXCEPT when he's stressed out?
However, I felt that the movie dropped some in its intensity when the mechanics behind the scenes get revealed.
Even more weird is when at the stroke of midnight, the city changes shape while everyone sleeps.
Maybe it's because when I've seen this movie, it's always way past midnight, but I guess it's part of the ultimate experience from it.
I love when a picture put that enormous hill of emotions in your heart, and just as many questions in your head.
We realize this question when we realize the purpose of the Strangers' inhabitance of the city.
Murdoch also discovers that the reason the Strangers are coming after him is because he has developed an immunity to the experiment, not falling asleep when everyone else does.
I think that people are right when they say that this movie isn't all that it could be.
This film is visually excellent, especially during the scenes when the strangers are changing the city.
The topic is about a man who loses his past and first finds himself in a bath tub, doesn^t know about himself and his life, but he has one ability that no one has, he can be alive when the evil forces stops the time and reshapes the world according to their own demand.
Any resemblance between President Bill Clinton and the Harrison Ford Chief Executive in Wolfgang Petersen's far-fetched, entertaining, but woefully predictable skyjacking saga "Air Force One" ends when Ford's fantastic First Guy starts knocking off the villains.
Like several other summer blockbusters, Marlowe's script does not know when to throw in the towel.
Ford's best scenes occur before take-off when he asks about his favorite football game.
Ford is one of the few male box office stars who can shed tears (when Ivan threatens to pull the trigger on his daughter) and not make it look schmaltzy.
This movie shows with total realism the heroism of a band of American people when their plane is high-jacked by terrorists.
That alone ought to be worth the watching, just so when she wins her Oscar you can say you saw her first great role.
The tension in the White House, when faced with the fact that it is the country's leader who is taken hostage, combined with the political intrigues that arise in such a situation, should have been exploited further.
A lot of them are clearly computer generated, and it is a let-down when it becomes this visible.
I think when they rank the worst 100, it should be done relative to the film's budget.
Like I said, I don't mind an action movie, sometimes I love the most clichÃ©'d one's, but not when it comes to serious stuff like terrorism, but I think I'm speaking from a post 9/11 view, so maybe if I saw this movie a before then, I wouldn't have mind it that much, but even then, there were moments that were terribly over acted and for me, it just didn't work for having a president like James Marshall, please, I wish.
"Air Force One" is an action picture so full of excitement that it had me on the edge of my seat when I first saw it on the big screen back in 1997.
And when we first see the plane from the inside, it looks as if were on a tour of the actual Air Force One itself and it's fascinating.
I expected a lot when I watched the movie.
When they managed to take control of the plane during landing, perform several off-road maneuvers with the plane that would make a Jeep proud, then get a Boeing 747 airborne again without benefit of a runway, that's when I went Popeye and decided I'd had all I could stand and I could stand no more.
Sigh with relief when the fax machine stalls, stalls a little longer, and thenÂ just when we'd given up hopeÂ stalls a little longer, and then works!
Clap like a whacked-out space cadet on class-a drugs when the fax lady parachutes to safety.
Scratch your head a little when you realise that the big plot device of the bad guys having a guy on the inside is of no interest or use whatsoever.
Marshall is the kind of President referred to a change in the U.S. foreign policyÂ He took a great risk when he stated that America will no longer tolerate any terrorist governmentÂ His policy is soon put in practice when he boards his plane on his way homeÂ   Once is in the sky, 'Air Force One' is hijacked and currently controlled by Russian radicals who ask for the release of their leader or they'll execute a prisoner every half hourÂ   Harrison Ford is the action hero making his way through the plane taking out few terrorists, managing to free several hostages, trying to get to his wife and daughter who are prisoners on boardÂ   Gary Oldman almost steals the show as the head terrorist Ivan Korshunov who takes over the president's planeÂ  Beautifully directed by Wolfgang Petersen who controls the action with his usual extreme intelligence, building the challenge with captivating, tense sequences from every compartment of the huge aircraft to the White House contingent in WashingtonÂ
To right the wrong that the first president Bush did when he kept Saddam Hussein in power after the Gulf War?
It's all jumbled in my mind and I can't remember exactly when and how the official reason change, I just know that it did somehow.
There is no "liberal bias" like you get from the news sometimes, it was simply factual presentation of what our leaders told us and when.
I wasn't too sure when I picked up this movie.
The obvious uses are the digitally filmed closeup shots in low-light of skin in Roman church art masterpieces leading up to the parallel shots of skin when the actors touch ... but note in particular the clenched hand on the sheet at the end of that scene, to be followed later by a montage of clenched hands on ancient statuary (interspersed with an angel) and the almost penultimate shot of a hand at the denouement ....
The scene in the bar with the barmaid when Bruce explains love -- and the final scene alone are worth the price of admission for eloquently filmed and acted moments of understated emotion.
A little time alone with her seems to change his mind, though, and he risks his life to give her back to the Navy when it seems they might be trying to fly away without her.
(The director apparently lost interest in Carter at the end, though; when the helo runs out of gas and crashes beside the ship, only very careful viewing lets you see him make it into the lifeboat, and he's not seen for the remainder of the movie.)
You know what I want to be when I grow up?
I think when you're an actor and sign onto scripts so clichÃ© and void of creativity, it reflects poorly upon you as a performer and what you can bring to a performance in future productions.
Another thing that surprised me was the unexpected seriousness, I actually found myself thinking about some of the character's observations on careers and goals, how sometimes we can totally lose our identity when all we try to do is to please others and maintain a decent salary.
Shumonto tells his father: "I may not have become someone, but when I see two people in love, I smile.
And when I see someone eating alone, I cry."
I had read also in the trivia section for Shawshank that Alfonso Freeman had several cameo's in Shawshank, and when I saw his name appear on screen in Sharktank, I thought I would enjoy him.
My favorite parts are when Fred is pointing the sub at Randy and when Fred reads the letter and says "Sharktank."
Adam & Evil most resembles a Friday the 13th (1980) or The Burning (1981) rip-off with teens being killed in & around a camp, the identity of the killer is kept a mystery until the end when there's a twist & the killer is revealed although one has to say the title sort of gives away who it is.
The kills are alright & at least there's a bit of variety between them, in a moment that looks like it could have come straight from The Burning a guy has his throat slit with a pair of garden shears, a couple are impaled by the neck when they have an arrow shot through them, someone is stabbed in the stomach with an axe, there's another slit throat, another arrow death & some more blood splatter along the way.
Well, what can I say - when the cable channel program guide classifies this as a "Substandard slasher film" then you KNOW there must be something wrong...
So, when the slasher disposes of one of the victims - a roman candle is left next to them.
Some of the murders seem improbable - like one where two kids are shot through the neck with the same arrow, when they were both facing the slasher?
And they were so fake and bad, like when there in the woods, yet there on sand?
I would have liked a big gaping wound when a throat gets slashed instead of stupid red magic marker drawn on the victim's neck - which is exactly what this movie does.
A group of teens head out on a camping trip to celebrate their high school graduation, but their party mood is short lived when they discover that a masked killer is hunting them down one by one.
Real deflated acting from a young cast of stock characters who are either constantly horny, lazing about and when the trouble kicks in, its all about the clueless YELLING(!)
It feels like it takes too long before the real fun begins and when it does, it gets a tad better (well, maybe more like tweeny weeny bit).
You can probably guess the killer just before the revelation with all the hints that crop up, but it's quite unsatisfying and doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it.
There are moments when it suddenly goes nuts when the film would break into a montage with a supporting rock song.
The camera-work is pretty standard and quite relentless when it has to be, but when it focuses on the killer we mostly see the lower half of the body.
The acting is horrible, the end reveal that you know is coming STILL doesn't make a lick of sense when it finally happens.
The wealthy occupants, Terry and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgard and Diane Lane), become legal guardians of sixteen-year old Rudy (Leelee Sobieski) and eleven-year old Rhett (Trevor Morgan), when the kids' parents die in an automobile accident.
The most dramatic scene was when Herbie "attempts" suicide.
I hated when Thorndyke beats Herbie and gets the car drunk.
I've seen this many times; when I was a little boy, I've always thought of these movies as not interesting.
Usually when a really old Disney VHS gets put in, after the logos and such, something boring was to follow!
It wasn't until around 1996 or so when I got acquainted with really old Disney live action movies much better.
1999 was when I was sick, and we rented a lot of videos; this being one of them.
At that time, that's when the movie became stuck in my head and became an instant favorite.
i first saw this film in 1989 when i was 8. i enjoyed it immensely and having taped it off TV i would watch it on a regular basis.
Thorndyke kicks the little car viciously, and when Douglas stands up for the VW, the little car decides that it wants Douglas for its owner.
I had seen it before, except I just didn't remember much about it, and my friend loved it a lot, so I knew it was going to be good when I was in for a re-watch.It turned out to be very cute and humorous at times, and Herbie was so sweet and cool as well.They also did a good job at building their characters, for all of them were really likable and nice.
It's sad when non-living things get typecast.
There was a lot of humor in the race when the bear took the saboteur's place when trying to keep Herbie from winning.
And who needed a chauffeur when you have Herbie doing the driving.
You know right from the start that there is something dreadfully suspicious and exceedingly bizarre about the Glass couple, but you can never be too sure exactly what at first (that's the purpose of a thriller, to throw you a few hints and let your quick assumptions guide you into all the wrong paths so that you're--hopefully--pleasantly surprised when the real perpetrator and his motives are revealed).
Unfortunately, this movie does terribly follow the book when it comes to the main character being disbelieved by other well-meaning characters (social workers, lawyers, teachers, etc.)
It also follows the book when it comes to the deranged finale and the he's-not-really dead ending.
This movie has something for everyone, comedy romance back in a time when Disney knew how to make a family film.
I watched them when they came out and was mildly amused at that time, but these Herbie flicks did not age well.
Yet that's what happens when one day racing driver Dean Jones comes into the auto show room of David Tomlinson who usually deals in the most pricey of cars.
And when it wants to the beetle has speed like nothing else.
And when you see one, you will no longer just see a car - you will see Herbie!
Jim is about to return it when he's caught in a drag race because someone makes fun of the VW.
Thorndyke decides to sabotage the little car and when he succeeds, Jim turns his back on Herbie.
We know very little about Jim Douglas except when Tennessee describes him as down on his luck, angry, and one who was prone to getting into trouble.
Michelle Lee is grand but we don't see much of her and Hackett plays the sincere bit amazingly well especially when he tells Jim that he was nothing without Herbie.
Carol thinking Jim has ulterior motives when Herbie brings them to a make-out point, i.e.
when Herbie tries to kill itself, and when Jim finally admits to Carol that he's just a bum), but the film has heart, like Herbie.
A jealous husband takes offence in his wife showing an interest in a hunky young worker he's just employed.And you know when Dixon finds out there's gonna be hell to pay!The young worker Ted(Billy Wirth)receives an almighty beating from Dixon leaving him blind.Now how is a blind lumberjack supposed to work?
The co stars do a pretty good job too supporting Ted when Dixon when he has his initial suspicions about his wife desiring another man.Dixon's behaviour making the bond stronger closer between the colleagues.One even stated he became a changed man when he got married.Though Ted should have done the wise thing and left when he could!
And she does act when she wants to.
Deep in the middle of the Amazon, territorial disputes over land rights take an ugly turn when prominent environmentalist Rafael Santos (Eduardo Cesti) is assassinated.
And it's all very well tacking on messages about the destruction of the rain forest but when it bears no relevance to the plot, what's the point?
It follows photo-journalist R.J.O'Brien (Craig Sheffer), who is jailed by corrupt South American police while investigating the murder of an environmental activist, being released when rain forest activist Alyssa (Sandra Bullock) kindly tells the police he is harmless.
When the Indian that R.J. was jailed with supposedly confesses to the murder R.J. believes he was framed, and when the Indian is found hanged in his cell R.J. and Alyssa decide to dig deeper, though Alyssa is less than impressed with R.J.'s behaviour to this point.
Alyssa arrives at his door, against instructions from her boss, just in time to untie him and they escape once again, but when they run to Alyssa's boss for help they find that she too is on the take and it seems that the happy duo are now left to bring the story to its conclusion by themselves.
You'll know it when you see it.
It is hard to imagine what the editors must have been thinking when splicing together all of the scenes in this movie.
This 1993, direct to video film harkens back to the beginning of Sandra Bullock's film career when she was probably thrilled to get a B movie script.
Yet, when I found myself in Montreal for one night with nothing to do, I asked around for a Canadian Film that I could check out.
My anger was raised when the Canadian general Dallaire who saw all this could do nothing because of the political stance of the countries mentioned and how he wanted to do something but his hands were tied.
Finding a lifeboat to share, the survivors are thrown into conflict when one of the survivors turns out to be the captain of the U-boat that sunk their ship.
The film opened to immediate critical acclaim during it's first week of release, however when a negative reviewer opted to focus on the treatment of Willy's character, it called into question whether the story was sympathizing with the Nazi cause.
What does it mean when the lone black Joe (Canada Lee) doesn't participate in the gang up on Willy?
If all that weren't enough, it was an unusual coincidence of timing that had me see this film when I did.
A better, richer film than when I first viewed it close to 20 years ago.
I saw this when it came out in the theaters and it didn't work for me at all.... Over the years I would catch a bit on T.V.
The way that Hitchcock uses his camera aboard the lifeboat is amazing, as by keeping the action on the claustrophobic craft, the great director ensures that his audience is always plugged into the plight of his characters; which helps the film no end when it comes to the story, as we know their situation at all times.
Given the time when this was made (towards the end of World War 2), it's hardly surprising that it's filled with propaganda.
When David O. Selznick got some loan out money from Darryl Zanuck for Alfred Hitchcock's services for two films (the second was never made), I'm sure Zanuck must have just loved Hitchcock when he told him that he wanted to make a film with just one set.
There's a reason for his actions and his fitness and when it's discovered, grave consequences erupt.
My favorite scene in Lifeboat is when Hodiak who represents the left on the boat is trying to rouse the rest to just toss Walter Slezak to the sharks when he first arrives, asks Lee for his opinion as he's a member of the party.
Its really fascinating to watch, and when its all said and done, you get the impression that it wasn't just an experiment, but that it had something to say, and it did.
I believe Anger was 17 when Fireworks was made.
I wonder how most people react to the ending especially back when the movie first came out... and what the sorta mood was as people got up out of their seats and left the theater.
When people ask me what is your favourite movie I have no hesitation when naming The Long Good Friday.
Im thinking about it now and I still feel my stomach drop when I imagine myself in Shand's shoes.
Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) tells nostalgic and emotional stories about his National Service (which had been abolished for almost two decades when this film was made) and how he began his career as a street urchin An hour earlier, he had been proclaiming his glorious vision of 1980s Britain while Â in a rather unsubtle piece of direction Â framed by Tower Bridge.
Keeping this question unanswered for so long rather than giving hints occasionally requires a predictably huge scene of exposition, which is totally subverted when it turns out that Shand hasn't actually done anything at all.
This is one of the great British movies and when I say British I mean it's made by a British film company - Handmade films - and not an American studio .
I have no idea when Reiner and Martin dreamt this up.
would be one of 3 cases to put forward, the other 2 being,Get Carter & Layer Cake: I cant see why other IMDb-ers have commented on futility's such as, water running backwards in the swimming pool, when what you have here is the making of two screen idols, coupled with the teaming of probably the greatest film making talent in our history.
Living high on success while fancying himself a political entrepreneur, he's about to close a lucrative partnership deal with the Yanks when the Irish Republican Army, bent on revenge, begins eliminating operatives from his "organization", undermining his reputation.
His character, caught unawares when the violence starts, can't figure out who would do this to him (it isn't so much the 'why?'
Gangland boss Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins) is on the verge of something big in his native London's docklands;replacing the declining port-side areas with vast new modern developments and buildings,even with a view to holding a future Olympic Games there.There is however a considerable fly in the ointment;would-be mafia backers are concerned as Harold's manor and underlings are subjected to a campaign of murder and bombings,later revealed to be the work of the IRA,who think Shand was responsible for the deaths of several of their members (when in fact he wasn't).An enraged Harold plans his revenge,but should he go ahead and do so?
The basic plot of "The Long Good Friday" is perhaps the film's only real weak point.In it's favour,it is certainly unusual but often somewhat over-complicated (several viewings may be needed to properly connect all it's threads) and a little far-fetched;the fact it is set around Easter (Ireland has had some very important events occurring around this holiday period throughout it's long history) may be intended irony.But in the midst of the considerable quality around it,these are modest complaints.John McKenzie's direction (what a shame his subsequent work has been much lower profile) is very well-judged,being either fast,exciting,subtle or reflective when the situation demands it,serving the thoughtful,literate,clever,often droll script by Barrie Keeffe.The characters are not the familiar stereotypes you'd expect in such gangster dramas,and performers like Bryan Marshall,Alan King and Eddie Constantine (in a rare English-speaking part) are given slightly more depth to roles that could have been mere ciphers.Helen Mirren is first class as Harold's mistress,one of the most interesting gangster's molls ever put on screen,but the entire film is dominated by the career defining performance of Bob Hoskins.His searing,commanding presence as Shand is outstanding,carrying conviction in every moment.Hoskins' portrayal is arguably the most anti of anti-heroes in cinematic history.Harold Shand thinks himself as a businessman and no longer a criminal with the 1980's about to loom,with apparent peace with rival gangs for a decade further emphasising this point.But with the uncontrollable mayhem taking place around him threatening his legitimate credentials,Harold is more than prepared to dish out some extremely brutal (if not sado-masochistic) treatment to find those responsible so the lucrative deal can go forward,making cynical,hypocritical remarks about the decline of various neighbourhoods along the way.
Hoskins in fact often makes this most unpleasant of characters sympathetic (with some witty one-liners part of his repertoire) in the midst of similarly unsavoury individuals.His grotesque arrogance and megalomania however get the better of him when he somehow thinks he can take on the even more ferocious and brutal elements within the IRA.He is warned of the risks by one of his closest associates,fresh-faced Jeff (who is killed by Harold in a savage outburst) but to no avail.The irony of course,is that Harold himself did not instigate this chaos;it the aforementioned Jeff and one of his most trusted friends and associates,Colin,a homosexual,who fell prey to the dual temptations of sex and money while in Belfast (doing an errand without Shand's knowledge or approval),placing Harold's business plans in dire jeopardy.
As one of Shand's associates says when Shand attempts to confront a group of IRA in London, "They are political.
In order to do that Rigby enlists the help from the greatest detective of all time, Philip Marlowe, and nods his hat to every great star of the era in this brilliant and largely forgotten Steve Martin film from a time when he was heading back to the top and working damn hard to do so.
The script is extremely clever and the scene when he is being warned off using a former girlfriend for an assignment is hilarious with Kirk Douglas as a particular nasty henchman.
Great British film...completely ignored here when it was released in 1980.
We hear nothing of these events until much later in the film, keeping it at the back of our minds and creating a certain shock element when we eventually realise everything that's come together.
As the film reaches its final third and Harold gets closer to the truth, the film reminded me of the original 'Get Carter' when Jack realises who's behind it all.
Its mix of live conserts, interviews and the scene when Chuck is teaching Keith Richard the riff for "Oh Carol" is probably the best i have seen.
If you were young when rock-and-roll was young, then you will probably enjoy this; if you were not young at that time, then this would give you a bit of history.
I was thirteen when I first heard Chuck Berry on a car radio in 1955 jamming out "Maybelline," the first true rock song I had ever heard.
"Sweet Little Sixteen" was written and performed by Chuck Berry when he was thirty two years old; yet the rocker captures the innocence and lust of being young and carefree.
Little Richard interjects humor into the proceedings when he talks about white-shoes Pat Boone crooning "Tutti Frutti," making the salacious lyrics, "Awopbopaloobopalopbamboom," sound like light opera.
Luckily, when Berry himself performs, all that hardly matters.
There really is no ax-grinding going on in this movie and there is no whitewashing - everything is what it is whether it's Berry in a touching scene with his mother and father or it's Berry in a petulant rehearsal stare-down with Keith Richards when Berry isn't getting his way.
I don't think many people saw Hail Hail Rock and Roll when it came out in 1987.
The rehearsals really show the difference between Chuck Berry when he's off stage (picky, self-centered, neurotic) and Chuck when he's performing (a unique entertainer).
", when everyone knows that Chuck wrote about what his fans were interested in, because Chuck himself was mostly interested in making money.
When they applauded, he did more of what caused that, and when they didn't, he didn't do that again.
Robertson also mis-reads Chuck (I thought it was pretty funny), when he calls Chuck's second prison term, "running into a brick wall".
Chuck says, not at all, that's where he took all those business courses that made him into the businessman he is, and as a result, he's rich when many of his contemporaries are not.
As a result of that (plus a publicity photo that made him look white), Chuck got booked in venues where he could not play when he showed up.
I have a fairly high tolerance for low-quality and low-budget movies, especially when they strive to be different from the usual Hollywood pap.
Then it does a really bad job at setting the stage for the mystery: it never takes the time to clearly help the audience understand the lay-out of the house or where people are supposed to be so that when the murder happens, we really understands that there is clearly something unsolvable about the mystery which would help grad audience attention.
And then, there are the moments when you are supposed to laugh probably to ease the tension that was never there in the first place.
I can never understand how this kind of stuff can get made or where these writers or directors heads are when they think this stuff up.
Steve Martin is funny, even when moments he's not trying to hard to be funny, he's even funnier.
So is Rachel Ward, she's enjoyable to watch, even when she plays off Martin So We'll.
The film is chock full of character with names like "Marc's Trick," "Hot Shirtless Guy" and "Hot Clothed Guy" - I'd rather receive a hot glue enema than sit through this a second time, but this film does raise so many questions: Why do people see movies like this when there are so many quality films out right now?
Kyle fell in love or should I say lust with Troy when he modeled nude for Kyle's art class.
This movie is full of hilarious one liners like when Tiffani says that she wishes a guy would say "I love you" instead of "Take it you tight little ..", that and many more.
How do films like this get financed when there are so many good screenplays languishing on shelves?
He then goes on to insult the director and the writer and that's when I stopped reading.
The only thing that saved this film from getting a perfect score from me was the running time was much too short, perhaps when they release the DVD they could give us a director's cut of more Tiffani and more gratuitous nudity by the terrific looking Marco Dapper and Brett Chuckerman!
The judgments they have made on the film are based on it being a realistic comedy when in fact it is a farce.
There is a gratuitous titillating surprise for you, although you might have trouble standing up when the lights pop up.
Truth be told, I wasn't keen on viewing Eating Out 2 when it played at the Portland Gay and Lesbian Film Festival, mostly because - not to put too fine a point on it - I absolutely abhorred the original and thought it was an coarse, overrated, and excruciatingly dull hunk of vitriolic idiocy.
I enjoy sarcasm when it's the icing on the cake, or the dressing on the salad.
surprise;I found myself seeing an incredible good film.It has wonderful performances by(of course)Al Pacino ,Russel Crow,Christopher Plummer and Diane Venora.It's one of that strange cases when the theme of the film isn't very interesting , but the film is so well made that you enjoy it like if it would have the most interesting theme possible.Michael Mann shows that is one of the best directors;making an absolutely absorbing film ,starting with a non much interesting theme ;it has nearly hypnotic moments (the most of them when Al Pacino and Russel Crow are having a phone conversation).It's so absorbing that the 2 hours and a half of it seems like lees than 1 hour.I can't say what's the best thing the film has,why?
Harassment, death-threats, a possible prison sentence and a collapsed marriage are a few of the ordeals that Wigand is put through -all, it would appear, to no avail when squabbling at CBS' 60 Minutes news programme leads them to ditch the programme, much to Bergman's horror.
There were complaints that Bergman got credit for things he didn't do, and that he didn't quit when they said he did, etc.
I'm reminded of the avalanche of criticism that Oliver Stone received when he chose Jim Garrison as his vehicle to probe the JFK assassination.
I'm surprised we didn't hear about how Michael Mann stole some lawn darts when he was in high school, or that Roth missed a Alfa-Romeo payment when he was in college.
Reporters once again had a little fun when it was reported that Crowe didn't invite the real Wigand to the premiere.
Pacino, as Bergman, creates a stubborn character, who's not ashamed of his liberal nature, even when he's in a sea of conservatives.
Al Pacino plays great journalist looking for the big story, but gets personal when Russell Crowe loses his job as a researcher for a big tobacco firm, and starts to come loose at the edges because of some damaging information he is aware of.
He just didn't have a lot of patience when it came to certain factors.
That's a bizarre comment, and not a complaint, exactly, but there is a sense when all is done that it was already known from the start.
How can there be tension when the director tries to make you believe something which simply is not true?
The story held my interest even when the tension left, thanks to the acting, the great cinematography, involving music score....well, just about everything.
I wasn't surprised when Ken Starr got a cheap shot, for example.
He gets his opportunity when Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), an ambitious and experienced reporter from the CBS news program "60 Minutes," receives a package regarding product safety studies at another tobacco company.
I get extremely emotional when *******s put bullets in my mailbox!).
Al Pacino is cautious not to steal scenes from co-star Russell Crowe, but when his time comes he lets out a stark and involving performance.
Here, he pays close attention to details; when a character pushes numbers on a pay phone, the camera captures the feeling-also hitting golf ball against a backdrop, dropping glasses on a table, and notably in an intense scene where two people fax each other important statements and questions.
It is only when their chance encounter creates a subtext that could consume them both does the real chemical reaction in the story take place.
when i've watched "Barda" i was expecting' a quality tension movie but i was disappointed when i saw it.instead of tension i just felt boredom.the story of the movie goes like this  a group of armed bank robbers entered to a bar after the robbery.few minutes later they took few customers in the bar as hostages and after that they begun torturing them until the night's over and cops bust in and arrest all of them  That wasn't the film which makers promised in it's trailers.Film completely filled with torture,beating,rape and murder.i still wonder how could they charge people to see a humans in the movie getting tortured,humiliated and so on.
Some of the patches are funny; Martin is constantly correcting people when they get his name wrong (because they're talking to other characters in other films) The two best comic moments involve a unique way to make coffee, and Martin's hopeless, post-rejection assessment of women.
when i saw it in a dark saloon.
You have to be stabilized and strong when you are watching this movie because it contains rapes,cutoffs,beating apparently.
They shot the film in a bar at Taksim, when I pass from there I feel horrified.
I mean if your social status is low, you are not respected, you are accepted as a "non-human" You see what one can do when he has nothing to lose.
Watch, when he dances with Shirley, how she matches him step for step - a marvelous terpsichorean treat.
It would've most definitely been a dominate television show if not been canceled, but the only bad part would be that long depressing state between seasons when all i can think about is more Freaks & Geeks.
And does so to perfection when he's called on to.
But, this is one of my favorite shows of all time, and I cried when they showed the last episode.
And then a money-hungry network will cancel it, just when it starts getting the fan support it needs to get ratings.
That's just what NBC did last year when it canceled "Freaks and Geeks".
The late Brandon Tardicoff (I think that's how you spell it) President of NBC, saved Seinfeld when it was in the same situation as F&G: he kept it on the air, even though it was getting low ratings.
Too bad he wasn't around when Freaks and Geeks got picked up.
Where was Tardicoff when we needed him...?
This gem of a movie slipped under the radar screen of the movie goer's consciousness when it was first released, but it will live on forever in the DVD collections of those who truly cherish good film-making.
Not only that, because I am smack in the middle of Generation X, I am very very rarely the target demographic, making times when I am the target demographic extremely special.
Before Judd Apatow was famous for directing great films such as "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and "Knocked Up" and before producing "superbad" and other comedy films, he made the TV series "Freaks and Geeks".I used to watch this show back when it was on during 1999 and 2000 but I was young so I didn't understand all the references and jokes.Watching it now I understand all the jokes and find the show to be an interesting and accurate portrayal of high school life.The show has all the high school cliques such as Geeks,Jocks etc.There is also a good mix of comedy and drama.The show also jump started the careers for many of the cast members such as James Franco(spiderman) and Seth Rogen(knocked up).If you can find this show anywhere like in syndication or something, watch it!.
This series caught my attention when it aired way back when, but upon recent reappraisal, lives up to the highest standard of scrutiny.
I love the attention to detail when it comes to the time period, how each main character and even a few side characters are treated with depth and complexity, and how real all the characters and their relationships seemed.
Except for when one girl is instructed by her parents to compliment her brother's body, and she takes it a step too far ("I'm With the Band").
The acting is competent; they manage to sound real even when the script has them freaking out, to an incredible degree ("Kim Kelly Is My Friend").
It goes to prove that the head honchos don't know quality when they see it and instead allow a number of abyssal reality shows or sitcoms to run for multiple seasons.
There isn't a single false note or a moment when you don't sympathize with the protagonists.
His scenes dressed as a woman are hilarious especially when he kisses Ward and confronts James Cagney(..from his role in "White Heat" portraying his mother).
They - especially Sam - actually look like the kids they're supposed to be, and I thought some of the most touching moments were when they were trying to straddle that line between childhood and adulthood.
Like when Sam throws away his toy trucks but still decides to go trick-or-treating on Halloween.
The moment in the pilot when Sam leads Cindy on the dance floor and then the music changes from slow to fast is initially funny, but the pained look on Sam's face like he's about to cry before he awkwardly starts to dance and cheers up brought tears to my eyes.
The episode when they watch a porn movie and are freaked out until the gym teacher sets Sam straight is priceless.
I loved how when Sam finally got the pretty cheerleader he'd been chasing it turned out she was boring and they had nothing in common.
I didn't understand the Freaks or why Lindsay wanted to hang out with them, especially at the beginning when they just wanted her for parties or cheating on tests.
The implication was that she'd decided there were no rewards for being a good person after witnessing her grandmother dying, but clearly she was not comfortable being a Freak, at least not until later episodes when the Freaks seemed to develop some genuine affection for her.
The suggestion is that they were high all the time, but apart from one episode (when Lindsay smokes marijuana) they never seemed to be smoking.
Of the Freaks I liked Nick the best - sweet but clueless, the episode when Lindsay's father takes him under his wing is great - him singing "Lady" to Lindsay and writing "Lady L" were hilarious.
I wasn't even born in 1980 (when the show is set), but the portrayal of the American high school experience is universal.
With so many one-dimensional shows about Abercrombie models being over-dramatic when not waxing and/or getting breast implants in their collective chests--depending on gender...or maybe not--there are few series that are willing to show a fair side to the rest of the hall populace.
Then came the scene when Todd thanked the team and the high school and then he thanked God, and I knew I was in for something special.
"Remember that time in science class when I tried to sneak out a fart and it came out aÂpoop?
I just don't want to see the expression on their face when they see that the bottle lands on me," says Bill, gently.
In fact, there are times when he comes off as manipulative and creepy and yet there is a sadness in his character that I haven't quite seen before.
Sadly, however, the network, too, is to blame, as it shifted the show into unrecognizable time slots, airing a show that was ideal for young audiences at a time when they would least likely be watching television--Friday and Sunday evenings.
I would also like to say while I adored nearly every character on the show (except for Nick who's obsession with Lindsay transformed him into not only a bizarre, but a boring character), I thought Martin Starr was the best as the witty Bill Haverchuck (I love his Bionic Woman bit when he is getting his costume ready in the Halloween episode).
It slows at times with the present day cast but when the stars are out the film becomes capable of inducing parody and awe at the same time.
Yes, there are similarities, and anyone who remembers watching Heroes when it first aired will notice them.
), and when you combine that with a VERY VERY low I.Q., this is what you get.
To be honest, I was somewhat relieved when seven days had passed and I was still alive!
The story is of Susan, a woman in her late thirties/early forties suffering from cancer who moves with her daughter from Chicago to California because she wants to be close to home and her parents when she dies.
The character of Caddie is a little in the shadows behind Henry and Nicky, but when called upon Caddie, i.e.
Not being a Steve Martin fan, one has to recognize that when this actor is inspired, he can do excellent work.
Not when the story is a complete mess and can only be regarded as an embarrassing failure.
It's laughable when it's supposed to be sad and it's unbelievable when it's supposed to be serious.
I believed him; **(here's the spoiler)** particularly when he's burning his magazines and he tells Miguelito that they're the type of people who don't forget, that they're the type who get their precious belongings and burn them.
Rock was 28 when he made this film for Universal and for the first time he was given first billing in a film.
It's thrills and chills as blood spills when Jimmy's ghost sets about its frightful revenge, his killers unaware of the gruesome fate that awaits them.
or so when tries unsuccessfully to switch over to comedy.
I should have known it would stink when Snoop Dogg is the lead.
this movie has a lot of old ideas all mixed into one, yet it doesn't look messy, several teen agers try and open a night club, on "holy ground" without noticing, one of the teenagers finds a girl but her mother is the local "crazy person" they ignore her about this but it was a bad move, when the club is up and running the fun begins, from maggots to wall of dead, its a fun thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat.
It's a huge shame that stuff like this gets made when there are screenwriters and directors with good ideas and just need some money.
I mean seriously, who goes by the name of 'Snoop Dogg' when they don't have to?
I will never forgive the people responsible for this movie for wasting all that time and money on it, when it could have been put to better use.
Dickerson tries to show us Bones as the protector of his 'hood, but come on - he's exploiting his people just as much with his numbers game, or did it never occur to anyone to ask how Bones got the money for his supah-dupah fly crib when everyone else around him lives in complete poverty?
All through the movie the blood was any color but the color of blood, I have to wonder if that was supposed to have paid homage to the days when the censorship laws prohibited film makers using blood colored blood, it does in its own way add a kind of sick humor to Bones and there was plenty of dark humor to go around in the first place, really there are parts that are quite funny.
By the way, when Snoop was floating across the room with those eyes, I was rolling on the floor.
I was doubtful about this movie when I went to the cinema to watch it last weekend, but after having watched it I reinforce my good opinion about the products made by New Line Cinema.
I first saw this in the theater with my dad, at the age of 13, when it was first released - he was a huge fan of classic movies and usually suffered through the stuff he took me to.
As we saw with the Da Vinci Code, when the main actor is flat or bad, no matter what you do the rest of the movie will fail.
The acting is a bit tireless, yet when taken into context of the genre of the satire, then it places well.
Maybe I'm just old enough to remember when gay men didn't spend all their time in a gym, staring at the mirror to confirm their own beauty.
I seem to recall that when I first came out in the early 70's, gym bunnies were few and far between in the gay male community.
I was hoping that this film might raise some serious objections to such values, but when the final credits were rolling I felt I hadn't really seen or heard very much to either provoke meaningful discussion or challenge these attitudes, which is what I expect a good satire to do.
Some may find it quite enjoyable, and feel it delivers on its promises, but I was less than satisfied when it was over.
"O Beautiful" a complicated high drama poignantly and accurately portrays gay male teenage angst, which is very traumatic and difficult to deal with especially when occurring right after the barbarous heinous act of a gay bashing.
The original EVIL SPAWN was completed and released in the halcyon days of video, when just about anything that was made could find its way onto product hungry rental shelves and turn a profit for all involved.
It is designed to make Lynn look younger, but has a nasty side-effect, when angered, she transforms into a hideous insect monster!
Pete is a suit in a downtown office building, Adrian is a multiply-pierced bicycle messenger who have a chance encounter when Pete takes a smoke break outside his office building.
well i live in the the area that parts of this show was filmed and i have seen how the drug world works....For some reason people think that this is bad.... wel the styriotypeing is not ,wel to me, styriotyping.... if seen people deal drugs and i have seen how thing go when something goes wrong..... and if some people that are hispanic and take offence with it then don't watch it.
Like Michael Corleone, the main character Miguel Cadena is patient, violent when he needs to be and donates money to the Catholic church.
It is hard to say whether these two men build a friendship, or more of an understanding when they spend the entire trying 20 minutes of the story talking about being gay, dealing with it and where to go from there.
Their friendship builds when they go out to a nightclub and again, 'bump heads' while looking around the club at the people dancing.
Why is it that when there is a great series on TV, possibly a big movie screen version, someone decides to end it.
I am 100% positive that a lot of viewers are going to be disappointed when this series ends on Tuesday.
All I have to say is, that this is the best movie I have seen, a movie that actually reflects on what happens when politics are involved.
The first episode alone was hilarious --a wacko cousin of the Kingpin doesn't like it when Kingpin's wife shoots her mouth off, so he plans to tear off her blouse and whip her!
And this is when he isn't feeding the body parts of his victims to his pet tiger!
It is also true that today the blood bath seems to be many times worse than when the movie was filmed.
It just tells the story of a little Cajun boy who enjoys living in the swampy Louisiana area, when suddenly an oil company shows up and starts building an oil derrick.
All the actors appear to be locals - this adds authenticity, but also presents a problem in that they are not greatly skilled when it comes to delivering their lines.
I attended Avon Old Farms (Where the movie was filmed)  I played Hockey there (The lead actor Plays Hockey)  The 2nd weekend there I got caught with a girl off campus and was about to get kicked out when...(Don't want to spoil the ending)  The Boardroom scene was verbatim.
On a side note, I must say that when I saw the giant squid in the finale, I laughed out loud.
It took forever to come out first of all, it was filmed when my friends brother, who just graduated, was a freshman there, and it just came out in 2006, and the quality is pretty bad.
when i was watching it, i was in my common room where one of the scened was filmed in, it was cool to see the common room being used by other people besides the school kids.
this movie was a lot like "the girl next door" when i say this i mean that it had the plot involving 2 kids, a rebel teenage girl and a not-so-rebel teenage boy.
It is a good approach to such a movie too, because you start to think it's a nuclear disaster at the beginning, and then you find out it's actually something a bit worse than that, when the crust of the earth moves, the Earth's balance shifts.
That's true, but especially when the magnetic field gets messed up, our apocalypse will come, or rather will rain down on us without holding back the tears of destruction.
Encountering other survivors quickly changes from a blessing to a curse when it is revealed that a violent volcanic eruption has altered not only the landscape but the fragile electromagnetic field, that surrounds the earth, altering human brain chemistry causing some to slip into insanity to a staggering degree.
He remembers traveling with his class somewhere when something happened, something terrible of which he is one of the few survivors.
Maybe I was in a bad mood when I saw this or something.
Jennifer Jason Leigh gives an excellent performance as a young woman traumatized by some mysterious events in her childhood, even though no one will be surprised by what that trauma is when it's revealed.
This was a timely and bold film, also, because it dealt squarely with the oncoming invasion of the heterosexual world by AIDS at a time when most straight folk still believed themselves immune.
This movie is not formulaic overall, when you consider that it's almost impossible to make a scary movie of any kind that hasn't been done before.
A nautical tale set in the Florida Keys in 1840, of salvage ships, their stalwart captains, and greedy profiteers (embodied by Raymond Massey and Robert Preston), the film works best when sticking to the 'physical' action, despite a sparkling performance by Paulette Goddard as the head of one of two rival salvage companies.
Wayne is a hard-headed, impatient skipper who Goddard rescues and falls for, but when lawyer Ray Milland arrives on the scene to investigate Wayne's lost ship, the inevitable 'triangle' develops, with Duke misreading things, and aligning with rival Massey.
I had the privilege of running into Jonathan Flora when he was touring in Ohio.
The movie begins with our hero Fang Gang awkwardly practicing his left handed farming technique, when a pair of visitors ask him to attend a sword fighting competition.
I was eight years old when I first saw this movie on the big screen in 1942.
I don't usually make a point to watch films this bad (predictable plot, laughable dialog, horrible music soundtrack, etc), but when I saw that my all-time favorite actor Jeremy Brett had a brief but memorable role in "Shameless" (originally titled "Mad Dogs and Englishmen"), I couldn't resist.
Lynch, as was his stated intention when he began making films, creates a small world of moving paintings mixed with real action.
My daughters loved it when they were young.
Over the course of her journey, Natty meets up with a knowledgeable young man by name of Harry (John Cusak), a group of rag-tag misfits with a rather mafia-esque 'you take care of us, we take care of you' motto, and a loyal 'Wolf' (which may or may not be a Husky, since everyone but Natty refers to it as a dog, and it is played by the dog of 'White Fang' fame) that seems to have a sixth-sense when it comes to danger.
spoilers -- only parts i disliked even though they were realistically portrayed were the orphanage even though im sure thats the way it was back then for orphans.treated meanly but they at least could have listened to her when she said she wasnt an orphan.and also for the father to just leave his kid behind with the landlady who obviously is a rather loose woman .he didnt have time to watch the kid when he was around as she was always playing hooky or sneaking into movie theatres ,,although during the depression , you did what you did to survive but still he should have considered her welfare more than just to leave her like that, he didnt even say goodbye to her at the beginning of the movie when he left.
I watched this movie when I was young (around 6) and rented it numerous times when going to the video store.
I got this movie out for the family, and yes there are unsettling bits in it, vis - the dog fight, the abuse, the orphanage, the tree scene, when you think about it probably the whole film.
Although I first saw this film when I was probably six years old, it has stuck with me as an inspiration, and set a standard that very few movies live up to.
Then there's the mis-adventures when she failed to getaway from the law, put in reform school.
I barely feel qualified to write a comment on this forgotten Disney live-action film from the mid-1980s, since I've only seen it once, and that was back when it first came out.
His was a name that brought in the public and their money when Capra was still a 'gag man' for Mack Sennett.
'The Journey of Natty Gann' was a film that I watched several times when I was a child.
So when he is forced to leave her at a moment's notice to travel to Washington (the only place he can find work) Natty is left in the care of a bitter Landlord.
I'm sure parents who took their children to see Natty Gann when it was released were surprised and shocked to discover that it was not a film for younger children.
This is not only the story of a young girl traveling across country to find her father, it is the story of people searching for hope and trying to survive in an age when just having food on the table was a constant struggle.
It's bad enough when a film that shouts "wide screen" is only released in a very horrid poorly done pan and scan, but the full screen transfer is one of the worst if not the worst I have ever seen.
Tom is playing a round of pool, and cheating if I might add, not knowing that Jerry is sleeping in one of the pockets, when Tom sinks a ball into said pocket crushing Jerry, a game of hilarious cat and mouse antics begin once again.
Anyway, it isn't surprising when it comes to Tom and Jerry, because they were always like that, right?
It doesn't disappoint me and it doesn't fail when it comes to the main ingredients of these animated shorts.
However, when it comes to the action, some things leave a bit to be desired.
But then again this is the yuppy 80s we're talking about when this film was made, so I suppose it wasn't cool to be wearing anything less than a Label.
So when all of them join with David Mamet and Brian DePalma,the result can be nothing short of explosive.
Ness begins the crackdown when he enlists the aid of three men: Jim Malone (Sean Connery), a Irish cop, a very raw and curious police recruit named George Stone (Andy Garcia), and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant who Ness meets in his office.
but this is the movie when all of brian de palma's tricks became treats.
I remember seeing this when i was a young kid and even though i didn't totaly understand it at the time, i thought it was so cool.
I never could quite reconcile Kevin Costner's somewhat-high and weak voice with some of macho characters he played when he was younger, but I can get past that after a film has settled into the story.
This is not a bad thing if you're making a Disney movie, but when you're making a crime drama, (especially one based on real life) realism is probably the way you want to go.
Malone is given, by far, the best dialogue in David Mamet's script as when he instructs Kevin Costner on how to get to Capone: "He puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue."
I actually perked up when I saw Ennio Morricone's name at the beginning because I loved his work in "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly".
They didn't build any dramatic scenes with it, and when they did, he used all the wrong music.
Treasury agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is working in Prohibition-era Chicago when he realises that a fair bit of crime, particularly bootlegging, is going unnoticed.
Connery is a given performance wise {accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here ?}
Surely historical facts does not matter when film's are as sharp as this one is,?
Quite a few words spring to my mind when I think of The Untouchables.
All the other films had completely different aims and even though I love a deep and brilliant story my main objective when I see a film is to be entertained and basically no film does that better than The Untouchables.
Then came an exception to this trend, when DeMille turned to the Mounties v. Louis Riel in Manitoba in NORTHWEST MOUNTED POLICE.
Yet a decade later, when it was re-released, they got top billing over the actual stars Milland and Goddard.
One day when I'm on my deathbed I'm going to look back and regret that I wasted an hour of my life with this stinker.
I guess that isn't needed when a menacing Ving Raymes can say choice bits like "A storm is coming" or whatever the heck he said.
Where were these kinds of girls when I was in college?
Does Clark flap his arms like a bird when he flies?
-- The one cool thing was when they killed the girl.
I can understand being easy on a pilot, but not when it is this bad.
When you can swim fast enough to keep up with a fighter jet racing overhead and become stronger when exposed to water, you're going to respond with shock when told that you might hail from some place other than South Florida?!
Sure, let's just believe that the sea baddies can tell when Orin is flying above, but can't find him when he's floating outside the door of a wrecked plane.
Let's make it so that he'll be out and about in the sea and completely defenseless, but instead they go pick on a jet plane and then be so kind as to leave him alone when he goes to save the mandatory hot female pilot.
Arthur 'AC' Curry (Aquaman) has his mother taken from him at an early age when their light plane crashed over the Bermuda Triangle.
The show will be much better in the later episodes when the characters history and importance is gone more in depth.
If this show is picked up, or should I say when this show is picked up, it will be an instant success because audiences love superheros and this show brings Aquaman to the level of any other great superhero rather than just being the loser one that talks to fish.
Unfortunately all of this goes sour when the premise kicks in and we witness Stockwell and Dudikoff adjust to the overblown horizons.
Everything is over the top, things are somewhat pretentious (especially when Stockwell narrates) and worst of all everything is boring.
)Gough and Millar were ripped off when this show wasn't picked up I mean this is a high quality show it pains me to think it might not get picked.
Who really needed "7th Heaven" for an 11th season when they could of had "Aquaman".
We are living in a day when the world is in love with super hero's.
You've got potential complicated relationships -- a young cutie guy who hits on all the bikini babes he can, finds out he's a lost prince, becomes an unselfish do-gooder when he'd rather party while still wanting to solve the disappearance of his mother.
Besides, I tend to find star Tomas Milian more interesting when playing an anti-hero (as here or in his better Spaghetti Westerns) than an out-and-out villain.
The story ends back in New York, when Joan and her colleague decide to get married with each other, in a very romantic end.
John Saxon just gives his name to the credits and works less than five minutes, when his character is killed.
The story ends back in New York, when Joan and her colleague decide to get married with each other, in a very romantic end.
John Saxon just gives his name to the credits and works less than five minutes, when his character is killed.
And when the killer was revealed, it had no effect on me at all.
The story ends back in New York, when Joan and her colleague decide to get married with each other, in a very romantic end.

Her woes increase when her husband calls from Italy and ends up getting his neck snapped mid-phone call!
the show makes you laugh hysterically and when will Vanessa learn to stop being so rebellious and when will Jordan become popular and shed his nerdy image.
the best part of the show is when Bernie be talking to the camera, saying America, and sometimes the most outrageous stuff comes from Bernie.
I'm not exactly sure when acts/threats of child abuse somehow become synonymous with "great comedy" on FOX (perhaps with the equally exploitive "Titus", or maybe when Homer started choking Bart in a vile running gag that dates back to the eighties?
I wonder when other sitcoms will finally get around to switching over to this more "cinematic" look?
I like the show when the air condition broke and ya had fun with the water hose out side, I like the way Jordon say stud pion.
By any chance do you happen to know when was Jorden born and where he was born at,and baby girl too, and Verneser.
tell Jorden when you see him that he a good Actor and keep up the good work.
I only recommend this show to his loyal fans and anyone looking for something to watch when nothing else is on.
In the end, when Vanessa finely saw (through the explanation provided by Wanda, that allowed her to see it was not pressure that moved Bernie, but utter confidence that she would succeed and merely playing his role the best (and perhaps the only) way he knew how.
Only, when they get outside, their idealism is quickly floundered when their chivalrous assistance of a young girl chased by nuclear mutants inadvertently leads to dangerous and disastrous flirtations with the 'darkside.'
This of course played into the TV "cool factor" as his weapon made a much louder, more devastating sound when fired and of course had much more "stopping power" upon impact with the intended victim.
Of course that's only when new-wave punk 80's band members aren't blowing each other across the screen.
This didn't happen there but he gets hit by the partner when love conquers all and he decides to quit the scheme when he falls back in love with Loy.
The problem is, he discovers he has a wife (Loy) and can't bring himself to leave--even when he finds out she hates him.
George learns that Kay is eager to divorce Larry because of his miserable, suffocatingly materialistic ways; and when meets Kay, whom he has forgotten, he falls for her and sets out to reclaim her love....The film's defining moment surprises us with its tenderness.
Standing in contrast to the film's madcap goings-on, it takes place when George escorts Kay, who thinks he's Larry, to the spot where years before he proposed to her as Larry.
One of his best scenes is when his wife refuses to dance with him, so he dances by himself.
Another occurs when, as a boy scout troop leader, he is asked to continue with the deer-tracking techniques he was teaching before leaving town.
The boys get in trouble when they mistake a satchel of securities for their supply of lipsticks and are hunted down by a pair of detectives, while Ms. Frisby's manager is planning to ruin the boys by turning over the securities as well as Ms. Frisby by sabotaging her entry in the transcontinental race.
*pees* Also when Powell dances alone!
Powell is something of a stuffed shirt when we meet him on the ship.
*pees* Also when Powell dances alone!
His apple cart is upset when he discovers he is falling for the wife he picked up during the nine year blackout.
This same philosophy stands me in good stead when watching what at first appraisal is a religious film, be it for the cinema or for TV.
From 1492, when Columbus sailed the wide ocean and found what he thought was India, up to the death of Teresa de JesÃºs 90 years later, Spain went through rather traumatic experiences.
Precisely in the Monastery of the `EncarnaciÃ³n' a chamber organ was found more or less when this film was being made: lost for over 400 years the `organillo de la Teresita' was discovered in an underground vault; it has now been restored and is the oldest working organ in the world.
  This series, based on the life of Santa Teresa de JesÃºs (sometimes called Santa Teresa de Ãvila) offers a historically validated account of the times when this mystic nun was setting up monasteries in the deepest depths of the interior of Spain.
"Teresa de JesÃºs" is an 8 hour mini-series, and Concha Velasca's "aging" (she was about the same age as Teresa when she began her reform at the time this was filmed) with the character seems both effortless and natural -- what talent.
Once you are done viewing it you realize how important is time and even when we allocate time for purposes of pure entertainment, and just that one has to chose wisely.
The only excitement, other than the very very end, is when John Malkovich finally shows up.
Considering all the great films produced (especailly when compared to some of the stinkers from Hollywood) how can this film get such a high rating from people?
Thankfully , the terrorist attacks ended the boring , multi-lingual dialog , when I could not stand it any more.
At the end, when I finally did see where the plot ended up, I was sorry I stuck with it as long as I did.
that the dramatic high point of the film occurs when we wonder if a small dog attached to a boat by its lead will get dragged into the water as the boat sways to and fro.
But I enjoy a lot when a movie obviously tries to teach me a lesson in such things.
Most importantly I find the cinematography in this movie very beautiful, specially when they talk on the boat and do stuff on the boat.
* The deliberate decision by the mother to go by ship from Europe to India, discovering the world at a deliberate laid back pace, taking several weeks when she could just fly there in 10 hrs.
Made in 1985 when the whole world lived under the shadow of the bomb and the Cold War looked like it would never end.
The film was not an "upper", but I can't help smiling when I think about it.
I specially liked when the little girl asked her mother for the meaning of some words that, even though we use a lot in every day conversation, almost no one knows its precise meaning.
Aside from Malkovich, who mixes French and English when speaking to Deneuve, they, if I didn't miss, don't even inject common Anglicisms.
It's like spending time with a good friend (or wife, if you have the one your supposed to have), when you don't really have to do or say anything.
We also see in some of the ports of call a famous woman boarding the ship, but they don't appear until the last segment of the picture, when the captain, John Walesa, invites Rosa Maria and her daughter to join him at his table where Delphine, Francesca, and Helena, are sitting.
The whole film has such a soothing quality and a peaceful beauty that when the unexpected happens we are caught completely unaware of it.
Coming above ground on April 1st, 2010, the bumbling pair, unaware that they possess the two keys for the last functional MX missile in existence, are totally unprepared for the harrowing experiences they have when they finally venture into the brutish, bombed-out post-apocalyptic world.
), decadent punks, and gigantic carnivorous sewer rats when they arrive in Edge City, a grimy, amoral metropolis populated by all kinds of freakish subhuman filth.
The scenes with the inept policemen are deplorable and watch the slipup when the Lt. flubs a line at the station.
Filmed at Universal, the story goes that the company balked when Hatton's disfiguring disease killed him before the film could be released and they sold it to PRC.
The Creeper is such a tragic character that it's difficult to fear him when you have such compassion for him and his predicament.
Rondo Hatton was a former reporter who began acting in films in 1930 when he was covering a film being made in Florida.
In this, one of his last films, not only does Hatton get the starring role, he has a great deal of dialogue and proves that he could be a good actor when given the chance.
Just like the character he plays, Rondo Hatton was an athlete when younger, and excelled at football.
The photography is well-done-especially considering the budget (or lack thereof) and there are some nice angles and lighting, especially when Hatton is prowling around the city.
It may be because it has never been released on DVD, it could be the terrible music number that grinds the movie to a halt just when the excitement should be building but perhaps it is just too odd.
Right when the movie starts, this guy is talking about all the weed he wants.
But much of the dialogue had me laughing out loud, and they even managed to create a staple character of sorts (youll know em when you see em).
I was also thinking it must have been difficult for him on a certain level to be hitting Curly when his kid brother was obviously not well.
It's when the boys are seated around the dinner table and being coached on proper dining etiquette but only pretending to use utensils and eat food.
When this movie started showing on cable when I was 11 I was drawn in forever.
not to mention that he brought a whole new light to things that most people don't even think about (even if it was for entertainments sake)  Awesome movie when you just don't know what else to watch!
(when it's important) I think the acting was actually pretty remarkable (even when it was meant to be goofy)
The best part of the movie is when he tells the prison guard, Phil,says "Rudy, you still owe me $100!"
Purely by accident, our two heroes end up in possession of the two keys that can launch the last nuclear missile in existence, and when this fact is discovered after they reach the last outpost of civilization - Edge City - they find themselves on the run from every mutant gang in town.
Marin is tooling around some factory one day when INS busts in and rounds up the lot of them.
I watched this show all the time as a child, and my unbelievable memory is even today still capable of pulling up a memory of seeing the Polkaroo on stage when I was only 1 or 2 years old.
Loved this show when I was a kid, I know lots of other people did too.
I wish I could find some toys and memorabilia to buy, all of the shows that were on when I was little were so much better than the majority of stuff now.
Personally, I don't think children's shows have been improved upon appreciably since the 70s, when at least diversity and imagination were openly encouraged, and the moral lessons were delivered a little more clearly without the obsequious and nauseating touchy feelie performances modern children's shows tend to use in lieu of actually explaining things to children.
It is when the little boy starts to talking how the young girl who is about to get married does not talk about her future husband all the time at all.
I especially when the girl walked in the forest with Stephen, it seems to be a place that has never been touched by human steps.
The 1930's costumes are impeccable and make you wish you could have lived then, when men still knew how to wear suits, and women could look feminine and sexy without looking trashy.
The protagonist/narrator Cassandra played excellently by Ramola Garai turns in a tour-de-force performance as a sometime gawky & awkward teen who despite her naivetÃ© is so wise behind her years when dealing with people and affairs of the heart.
when they meet the curvaceous owner of Maiden America Beauty Products and her lovely female employees.
If one is ever homesick for england as Dodie Smith was when she wrote the novel, this is the movie to turn to for refuge.
they took important bits out and added useless bits in in their places, we lost the motherly characters for rose and Cassandra when Mrs blossom was just a dummy we saw in the corner of the screen and ms Marcy was just a school teacher with little say in their lives when both characters had a great deal of say in the book for as i said they add a kind of motherly atmosphere for the girls for they have no mother and it shows just how much they miss their mother but in the film without them they also loose the atmosphere for rose and Cassandra and their lose and suffering without their biological mother.
I was thrilled when I saw that the book had been made into a movie, for the first time since it was written, over 50 years before.
I know a book has to change when it becomes a movie, but I missed characters like the romantically-minded school teacher and the dressmaker's dummy that Cassandra "brings to life".
Interesting that when this show was made, it was two years before the Supreme Court Ruling June, 1963 Madyln Murray vs. whichever school district that eliminated prayer in public schools.
I was thrilled when I learned this book was being turned into a movie, but was dismayed at the casting of the American brothers.
It was especially annoying when the screenwriter claimed scenes were true to the book when they weren't.
The worst was when she made a big deal about not changing the ending, saying that Dodie Smith (the author) had been offered half a million dollars by book-of-the-month club to change it and she (the screenwriter) felt that if Smith resisted that much money it was important the ending stay the same.
So naturally when one night two rich and eligible American bachelors (and brothers) set foot in the castle, she takes her chance.
Younger sister Cassandra (Ronola Garai) is engagingly wise, funny and bewildered at the changes that overtake her family when two young Americans succeed to the ownership of a manor that encompasses the castle (for which rent is long overdue).
Nick Broomfield is totally out of his mind when he tries to fight for Aileen.
There were times when Aileen came across as likable.
But then you look at her eyes change when she talks about her life and you can the whites and it is frightening.
A 13 year old girl raped and impregnated by her grandfather, who slept in the freezing Michigan forest when her family kicked her out of their house.
Not to mention that when I saw the movie Monster, that won Charlize Theron her Oscar, I was more interested in learning about Aileen Wuornos, one of the country's first female serial killers.
Why did everyone look the other way when Wuornos was kicked out of home?
She was forced to live in the woods and had to sleep in the snow when winter came!
The evidence of this is readily apparent when her friend Dawn shows Broomfield around the small Florida settlement of where she grew up.
The most disturbing part of the film is when Aileen is going after the death penalty as a GOAL.
The defining moment of this film is when after a fit of ranting, Aileen gives the camera the finger.
Don't worry I have no idea who she was either and it's only when I'm told that Charlize Theron played her in MONSTER that I discovered who she was .
Were there any gays when you were at school ? "
One of the neat touches that occur through "Ace High" is little bits and pieces like the dusty boot prints that Cat and Hutch leave when they saunter across Harold's blood red carpet in this upstairs office.
Or, when he breaks the bank in the casino.
The movie is definitely worth seeing, and it does not disappoint even when watched more times.
The theme of publicly executing undesirables, by the way, bears amazing resemblance to the brutal regime of Mao Tse-tung, which was at it's heyday when this episode first aired.
Conclusion: Very bad movie, but a lot of fun to watch, but Charles Band did better in the past, I will definitely watch it again when it runs after midnight and there is no alternative.
Then there's the fact that Moira is a dominatrix, the film comes alive when she goes into mistress mode & abuses her husband & her scenes are the only reason I'm giving Blood Dolls 3 stars instead of 1.
There's hardly any blood or gore, someone gets bashed over the head with a lifting weight, someone gets a scalpel in the eye, a guy is killed when wires dig into his flesh & a drill burrows into someones chest with lots of blood splatter.
Our hero in this story is Virgil who, when you look past his racist dolls, desire to take over the world and utter hatred for all other beings, is just a guy like the rest of us.
The funniest part is when they're setting the stake - out and the librarian faints.
It helps that the effects, designed by Randall Willaim Cook, are pretty ace when they do appear.
Virginia has no luck but when she returns home she finds a copy waiting for her outside her apartment door, she starts to read as the book once again features Dr. Kessler who is madly in love with an actress named Anna Templar (Jenny Wright again) who doesn't return the sentiment saying that he is ugly.
The next day Virginia sees a report in a local newspaper which tells of the murder of an actress & one of Virginia's friends named Colette Berkowitz (Michelle Jordan), after this event & a face to face meeting with Kessler before he kills & slices the ears off a pianist (Bruce Wagner) who lives near her, Virginia is convinced that the character of Dr. Kessler is responsible & comes to life when she reads I, Madman.
I first saw this episode when it was originally aired in 1961 and have since collected it on LaserDisc.
This film is only worthwhile to make you appreciate when you see a quality movie of the genre.
Two scenes I particularly remember:  One is when the Japanese, on the pretext of surrendering on a beach, have a machine gun hidden on the back of one of their soldiers.
And of course the key scene is when the conscientious objector, played by Alan Ladd, finally fires his gun in defense of his fellow soldiers.
That was when movie tickets were .35 cents and the loges were 50 cents.
One thing in particular that has always stuck with me after viewing this was when SPOILER: Alan Ladd's character finally starts to shoot the Japanese soldiers.
Having long forsaken his Quaker upbringing he is thus completely blindsided when after reporting for duty on a destroyer he finds himself seriously conflicted regarding the taking of life.
What the medium at the time was NOT showing, was that things hadn't changed since the First World War: when the troops come home, they are not the same people they were when they went away.
There is NO attempt to be 'real' or even occasionally-accurate when it comes to weapons per se and why people steal/use them.
Karslake says that when he first came out to his parents he said that his dad used to call his answering machine and leave Bible verses on the machine.
Urging parents to rush underage children to the fray is the closing message, a necessary strategic goal in the late stages of WWII when this recruitment vehicle was released in 1946.
Thank fate for the 1970s when Hollywood finally got a social conscience that has yet to be fully interred for the sake of the interests of the National Security State myth.
Not that I'm either, but I hate it when people try to get their point across in such a black & white matter.
Also it should be perceived as when it was written--hundreds of years ago.
My favorite moment in the film was when one of the scholars challenges these religious leaders to obey Jesus's commandment to sell all you have and give it to the poor and then you can follow him.
Specifically, FP's yapping makes Claude jump, and just when he looks safe, there's more in store.
A total mess, though I do give it credit for trying to dip into different genres, but when you title your film "Drive-In Massacre," that is what you need to deliver!
Two fat cops Mike and John (James Barnes and Micheal Alden) are put on the case, but unfortunately when it comes to solving the crime and capturing the killer these guys are about as useful as a chocolate fireguard.
The cops helpfully observe "well, she's in pretty bad shape, she was murdered with a sword" and when they want to talk with Atkins again one says "lets go get that bald headed garbage can!"
Anyway, they are baffled, the only lead they have is a man named Orville (Norman Sherlock) who hangs around the drive-in and spy's on people in their cars having sex, but when questioned by the two cops he claims he had nothing to do with the killings and he says "I just wanted to beat my meat!
It's what happens when the budget doesn't allow much editing or proper music for tension.
But just when you think it can't get any worse it does, with an utterly ridiculous and infuriating ending.
Then, when the two least likely looking detectives get involved, you laugh even louder.
She does what she wants when she wants.
I was only 4 and 5 in 1976 and recall only one time being sneaked into a drive-in; my understanding of drive-ins, however, is that when things on the screen got boring, people honked their horns.
eagerness to help with the investigation and wounded reaction when finally being pushed too far helping to ground the film.
For the type of movie this is, given when it was made, and a total lack of big name stars ( or small name stars for that matter ) this film is very watchable.
HORROR BUSINESS is a series of interviews with, and an advertisement for, some guys who call themselves "independent film-makers" when they're feeling mellow, otherwise they use terms like "guerilla", or "subversive".
They imagine themselves as subversives preaching the gospel of grindhouse horror, when there's nothing subversive about that.
The limits some place on themselves when deciding just what it is about horror that they like and dislike are interesting.
Horror Business follows Mark as he gets started writing and filming the movie and it's a great glimpse into the world of independent film, as Mark tells his mother that because she's given him money, she's a defacto executive producer on his film, and the behind the scenes footage of the filming is informative too, when the person who was supposed to run the camera doesn't show up, Mark calls on an extra who's run a camera before to do the filming for the night, explaining that the more experience you have in the film industry the more likely it is that you'll get to work if you find yourself on a movie set, which seems to be true!
And so, until next time when I'll tell you about my documentary, I'm going behind the scenes of a bakery, not because I think it'll be a good movie, just because I like the donuts, remember that the best movies are bad movies.
You get scared, but when it's all over you have a good laugh and want to go on again.
Garetano also interviewed such horror veterans as Herschell Gordon Lewis, whose advice to filmmakers is to make a movie FOR the audience, NOT for yourself and "The Devil's Rejects" Sid Haig who gives his opinion on when a horror movie goes too far.
Cult movie critic Joe Bob Briggs offers his three rules of film-making which are hilarious, Troma king Lloyd Kaufman stops by and "Fangoria" editor Tony Timpone gives his insight on the state of horror today versus when he first started at "Fangoria".
He interviews some very young film fans and asks them what they want to be when they grow up and, naturally, they all want to make movies.
One thing they all seem to have in common though, is a love for such classic horror films as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Last House on the Left", both films being mentioned by all of the filmmakers as having a huge impact on them when they were young.
Lewis ('The Godfather of Gore') discusses entertainment vs. indulgence, Sid Haig(The Devil's Rejects, Spider Baby) talks commitment and "how much is too much," Tony Timpone(head of Fangoria magazine) shares his views on the genre's viability, and Joe Bob Briggs nails it when he discusses what usually sucks about low or no-budget films(stop casting your non-actor friends!).
Standout sequence for me is when Hedges (and we) think 5c have gone to bed for the night and he heads off to the pub with Price... only to bump into his pupils there.
I brought series 1 and 2 of Please Sir yesterday, so when I have finished watching them, I will review the TV series
18 year old fatherless Tina (Jessica Pare) is a Canadian female hockey player who rises to stardom as a model when a small time sports photographer snaps her pic.
How you react when plunged into the spotlight, or whether you even get a choice is something all together different.
Tina Menzhal goes from being just another small town girl playing hockey to international superstar when her picture finds its way into the right hands.
Although she had originally sent in a tape for a minor role, when she walked in for her audition Arcand knew immediately that he had found his Tina.
Frank Langella is amusing as the aging diplomat caught in a late life crisis, who tries vainly to control Tina so that he may bask in her beauty, and is burned when he gets too close to the flame.
That is a given.It's not like today when everybody loves one another and we all live in harmony in a Rainbow Nation and all creeds and races co - exist in an atmosphere of mutual respect.Well,don't they?
So here we are in 2006 tsk tsking about a film that shows a society whose views we don't approve of.They were times of social unrest,when there appeared to be a real threat to the status quo.Criminals took advantage of the turmoil and it was difficult to tell the man with a grievance from the man with a gun.
Flatulence on film was funny when Mel Brooks did it in the classic "Blazing Saddles" but that was a long, long time ago.
The relationship between Lee and Mack is what gives the film its gravity Â one especially relishes the scene when the star proudly shows him his collection of treasured Kung Fu memorabilia, including 'the actual socks worn by Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon' (sadly unwashed) - and the obvious affection shown the genre by the principals shines through constantly.
One particular description by Crumb over a comic of a woman with a headless body being seductive for a main character is very fascinating, as it brings out several different reactions when reading it- laughter at the random-ness of the characters, romantic drama with the man's lusting for this headless woman, and pure odd-ness at what goes on here.
And when it comes to his family they too are just as candid; it's a little depressing, to be sure, to see the state of his brothers (Charles, in particular, who is actually an identifiable character for many outsiders in the world, only to an extreme), and the tales of his father.
For the reason, Charles might have been a better artist than Robert when he decided to stop drawing.
Davis's reaction to this and her ultimate sacrifice as redemption, when she later tends to fever - infected Fonda at the movie's climax encompass the main plot to this grand old piece of Hollywood costume drama.
or remember when george carlin said the dreaded "n-word," apparently in protest of the rule that blacks and whites are supposed to use separate vocabularies?
Or maybe its just that Crumb's fixation with wrestling and piggyback riding lingers in your mind when he hugs his daughter.
He also maintains an honesty and a level of integrity that is just not seen these days, the exception being Dave Chapelle when he walked away from $50 million.
However, as this film makes abundantly clear, Robert Crumb is practically the ideal model of a stable, well-adjusted person when compared to his mother or his brothers Charles and Maxon.
I admire R. Crumb's courage to speak unpopular truths, to draw what gets him off, and to ferret out the art he loves at considerable expense and trouble (he's a blues maven; one of my favorite scenes, where's he's sitting on his floor absorbed by aching music, is echoed in Ghost World, when Enid takes home Seymour's record and gets lost in her favorite song).
After reading the couple of negative reviews of "Crumb" on IMDB I re - viewed the movie one more time just to make sure that the many times when I had seen this movie before, on the silver screen and on video, I have not been in a state of delusion.
Shearer's silent film techniques are also put to good use near the end of the film when the totally distraught and prematurely aged queen is awaiting execution in her cell.
George Brent as Buck represents a final flowering of the Old South's aristocracy and even chivalry (and again demonstrates that Brent could act - note the heavy restraint when he confronts Richard Cromwell's Ted toward the end of the film).
for this film, I think she does a perfectly credible job going from a teenager to a young adult at the time of execution (the queen was supposed to about 36 when she was guillotined).
The animosity between the two was tastefully acted, when it was a much nastier confrontation.
Whether she's getting married or when she falls in love with handsome Tyrone Power or when the peasants storm the ChÃ¢teau, Shearer's expression hardly changes.
So how does Norma react when the stage coach is stopped?
But even actors of limited range can get away with this problem when they have star power or screen presence.
Both we in their mid-teens when married.
Both films start when Marie is 15 and she leaves her beloved Vienna to marry the future Luis XVI, the Dauphine of France, one year her senior.
We witness an unsuccessful attempt of Royal family to leave the country that brought both, the King and the Queen to the trial for treason; execution of her husband on the guillotine, separation from her son who was taken from her on the very day of Louis XVI's death, brought to court to testify against her, and died in captivity when he was 12 years old.
Norma Shearer is magnificent in her portrayal of Marie from age 14, when she was betrothed to the future Louis XVI, through their awkward marriage, and the years of their monarchy, culminating with their tragic destiny.
Fairly accurate Historical Drama of the life of Marie Antoinette from when she left Austria (age 15 in 1770) to marry the Dauphin of France through her demise via guillotine (1793) in the chaos of the French Revolution.
Her delightful performance makes this a film to be cherished as we see her as a giddy youth while she enjoys being the dauphine, flirtatious nature with Count Fersen, loving queen to Louis XVI, anxious escapee during Flight to Varennes, horrified spouse when she learns of her husbands fate, terrified parent when her child is taken from her & dignified condemned prisoner as she rides in the cart & up the stairs to die are all moments is this wonderful movie than begin when the movie begins & wont ever end in your mind.
Although the story of Marie Antoinette starts when Marie was a teenager, unlike in her Romeo and Juliet, Norma Shearer ages in this part.
The lost art of story-telling  This film was planned with intelligence and skill and was built around the principle stated by Selznick when filming GWTW: 'The secret of adapting a book to the screen is to give the impression that you are adapting a book to the screen.'
Her virtuosity as the fated widowed Queen is all the more poignant when one realizes that at the time she was Thalberg's widow in her last husband-approved venture and that the Hollywood suits were rapidly closing in on her.
Norma Shearer did such a great job near the end, when she was about to be beheaded.
Forget Shearer's uneven acting, which as in all her films veers from the truly affecting to the annoyingly melodramatic (e.g., her stagey, even hokey body language in the night meeting with Tyrone Power in the garden just after she becomes queen, when he makes her understand they must not see each other again).
In the 1930s when Zweig's book was new and influential, MGM could base a movie on it but couldn't openly portray the sexual issues at the heart of Zweig's account.
It's unlikely that Marie's sex life was as active as some writers want us to believe, but she could spend up a storm when she put her mind to it.
Power was the inspiration for Barbara Cartland to say, when asked how she could write so convincingly about sex while she was a still a virgin, "We didn't need sex.
In a film that excels in manipulating even the most docile audience into wanting blood, Bronson plays a kindly architect who turns into a vigilante when his family is brutally attacked.
Bronson isn't perhaps the most obvious choice to play a pacifistic architect, but he is, of course, right at home when it comes to the vengeful aspects of the character.
Which is why when he finds out that his wife has been murdered and his daughter has been raped, you really feel for him because of his superb acting.
And you're completely on his side when he turns to a life of vigilantism, killing sociopathic muggers, because he is just so believable.
Sure, the director Michael Winner may not be one of the greatest directors in the world and sure the other four "Death Wish" films really sucked (especially "The Face of Death"), but at the end of the day when, in "Death Wish", Charles Bronson smiles at a group of rowdy kids and mimes firing a gun at them, you have to shut up and let the king of badasses do his work.
But there was a time when the redoubtable friend of the stars was capable of better things, and DEATH WISH is proof that Winner once had some degree of talent.
Right away the film telegraphs its POV about violence, when one of Kersey's coworkers calls him a knee-jerk liberal and, knowing it's a Bronson film, we can see that an awakening is about to happen.
This got lambasted by liberal film critics when it came out, of course, just as Dirty Harry had three years previously, but what's interesting about it today is how low-key the attacks on liberal values are, and in fact the film really doesn't go after anything except on-the-street violence.
Probably the most extreme part is at the very end, when the rather sympathetic police detective (Vincent Gardenia) who's been in charge of hunting down "the vigilante" lets Kersey go - but given the vision of the city this film gives us, this isn't really unexpected.
Death Wish is one of those movies about New York in the 70's,when the city was a toilet.
Still when the world seems an awful place, when it seems like justice isn't being done in the real world..at least in the movies it seems the heroes can win...and that's where this movie's charm lies..in there somewhere.
This movie is even better than when it first came out in 1974.
She plays a very spoiled and uncompromising southern belle named Julie in 1850's New Orleans, who intends to marry young beau Henry Fonda but mercilessly tries his patience; she is selfishly late for her own party, and despite all self-respecting folks' protests, rebelliously dons a glowing red gown at a Grand Ball at a time when it's forbidden for any unmarried woman to wear anything other than white.
One year later, when a violent outbreak of Yellow Fever plagues the south for the first time in 22 years, Fonda returns home again; but it will be an unpleasant shock for the headstrong and vengeful Davis.
The greatest scene in the movie has got to be the humiliating Olympus Ball sequence, with Davis beginning to have second thoughts when she is ostracized by hundreds of aghast eyes, leering at her and Fonda as they waltz around an abandoned dance floor while she wears that controversial dress.
We know that this movie will be great from the beginning when Bronson cashes in a 20 dollar bill for two rolls of quarters so that he can stuff them in a sock and smash it across some dude's face.
This is indeed so terrifying and real it tops a scene like the one in Clockwork Orange with the assault on the writer; it's somehow even more shocking when its in an apartment in the now, with hoodlums as random and sadistic as the ones here.
The first signs of him knowing what's around him on the streets at night (and one of the funnier bits of the film's bleakness) is when he takes a sock full of quarters to use on the hoodlums.
Cleverly directed, well acted and graphic when it has to be, this is a great film and serves its purpose well.
New York businessman Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is devastated when his wife (Hope Lange) and daughter (Kathleen Tolan) are sexually assaulted in their own home.
"Death Wish" was a highly controversial film when initially released.
Perhaps when it was released in 1938 there would be a feeling that Davis' character has turned a corner and has become more selfless, but to me her motives seemed awfully suspicious.
The movie "Death Wish" hit a raw nerve with the public as well as the local politicians and police because it showed how, in the movie at least, one man with a gun and knowing how to use it can make a difference when it comes to stopping crime.
There's been many times when average people took to protecting themselves, with firearms, and did a much better job then the police; which is just what Paul Kersey did in the movie.
Charles Bronson is a Manhattan middle-aged architect who was at work's one day, when three brutal punks invade his Riverside Drive apartment and attack his loving wife and happily wed daughter...
He takes a job working for a land developer in New Mexico to get his mind off his troubles, and while there his long dormant fascination with guns is renewed when his client Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin) shows off his personal collection and lets him crack some shots off.
The movie does play it safe when it comes to Kersey's "victims" however.
And the self-defense aspect of his actions becomes equally cloudy when he kills muggers that are already fleeing.
Gardenia is a nice foil for Bronson, making Ochoa an intelligent officer not unsympathetic to Kersey's crusade, especially when he sees how the crime rate plummets following the killings.
This movie rediscovers the beauty of LOVE, long after the success of DDLJ, when creativity started dwindling with more and more movies trying to replicate it rather than coming up with something altogether different or FRESH.
She soon loses him for what appears to be the second time when she wears a red dress to a ball where all the women are in white.
There are some striking scenes: the dance sequence, when Press and Julia are the only ones on the dance floor due to her being in red; and the end is very striking.
The action really starts when hero falls in love with heroine who is a abroad born girls where she never likes to stay in India... hero tries to keep her in India as to convey his true I've to her The most brilliant aspect of the movie is the urban landscape setting, the lighting, and the cinematography.
The best performance is by hero who uses the dialog in a convincing manner to make the audience laugh and to generate empathy when he is crying.
In this case a teenage girl who is somewhat troubled is sent off to the country when her parents separate.
Close lives also Mrs Koide with whom she used to play when she was a kid.
He uses a quiet, subtle feeling the movie has when it's... "too quiet" and the pumped-up feeling during the more intense dramatic scenes.
It is there that he meets an interesting woman (Roseanna Arquette) when he observes that she is reading the novel called Tropic of Cancer.
I cannot name the magic phenomena which appears to surround it.I first saw it on British TV about four years ago when it first made its impression upon me since which time I have been drawn to it like a magnet for some unexplainable reason.
Another film might setup Paul as a meek, hard-working, likable guy who gets stuck in bad situations Â when in fact Paul is a confident jerk who probably deserves what is coming to him.
He puts the moves on Arquette, then ditches her when she resists.
It does have a few moments where it goes a little over the top, like when we meet the character Horst, played by perennial weirdo Will Patton, but those scenes are such a small part of the whole that it can be overlooked.
The girl (Rosanna Arquette) invites him on a date, but when he gets there he finds that she lives in a really seedy district of town, sharing an apartment with a flirtatious female sculptor (Linda Fiorentino).
Scorsese made After Hours when he was forced to stop working on "The Last Temptation of Christ" and was depressed, frustrated, and uncertain if he would ever return to it.
Griffin Dunne plays a young and mild-mannered New York City professional who is brought into a hellish nightmare in Soho when he loses his cab fare and his thrown out of the cab.
I saw this when this first came out about 19 (!)
I was happy when I finally popped After Hours into the DVD player, it is a darkly funny, well written downtown New York Adventure.
Bette Davis character is a controlling, independent and spoiled young woman and when she finds out that her former fiancÃ© is married, she tells her aunt that she would fight for him despite being married and her aunt compares Julie with Jezebel.
UghÂ   I have to mention the last of Paul's meetings, when there is absolutely nowhere else to turn: June, at the club (Verna Bloom), seems to be the only person who truly understands his predicament and who helps to finally "rescue" him, but her means are highly suspicious.
Perhaps one of the Scorsese minor masterpieces that sometimes get lost when considering "Goodfellas" or even "Mean Streets," films that get the bulk of the chatter.
His journey to downtown New York goes hideously wrong when he loses his taxi fare and spends the rest of the evening trying to get home.
This wasn't a big hit when it came out, but it should have been.
It's one of his best, even though many critics did not like it when it came out.
It's just so BORING the gag of the title wears off quick when you see what it actually looks like on screen.
She appeals for help with her man, but things go awry when manservant Malcomb tries to thwart the romance because he is in desperate love with Winnie.
Clanging and suspenseful chords can be heard when nothing happens.
Many are aware of the Blacula series that probably gave ideas to Eddie Murphy and Wes Craven when they made Vampire In Brooklyn during one of Eddie's many low periods.
else and when they keep injecting the DNA in him, he mutates into the title character: BLACKENSTEIN!
Of course, Blacky goes around killing his victims; although he seems to have an agenda when it comes to his slayings.
The scenes showing Eddie tearing apart people are simply hilarious; the definite sidesplitting highlight occurs when our hideously malformed maniac disembowels a shrieking topless woman in an alley way.
So, a short time later when Fonda is stricken with Yellow Fever, she tries to redeem herself by volunteering to follow him into quarantine to nurse him back to health--at which time the movie ends.
Dr. Stein's servant, Malcomb, takes revenge on Winifred when she spurns his love.
Usually, when watching an HK actioner you should suspend your disbelief to an unbearable degree.
The intro to the movie was like an american noir film with the way the lighting and camera shots were used when Donnie Yen is talking to the radio show host.
Having no patience to go looking for cats at his age Ira changes his mind when he finds out that Harry was on the case, in finding Winston, at the time of his murder and feels that Harry trying to find Margo's cat may have had something to do with his untimely death.
Lily Tomlin is perfect as the over-age hippie Margo Sperling who also begins to take life seriously when she realizes that she and Ira's lives are in danger in an elaborate scheme to distance the Whiting murders away from those responsible for them and make them look like a robbery gone wrong.
I would go a little further and suggest that the premise of the movie is what would the case be like if Philip Marlowe were roped into a mystery when he was pushing 80?
I saw this film when it first came out nearly 30 years ago, and then watched it again recently.
At a time when so many films rely on computer generated images, and plots that seem dreamed up by marketing departments, it was refreshing to rediscover a film that relies on strong direction, and outstanding acting.
The saddest thing about Robert Benton's "The Late Show" is that it has gotten lost in the shuffle when discussing the great movies of the nineteen seventies.
A must see for any horny boy that wants to see a movie with one scene of a naked lady or a boy that has rapist thoughts when they look at a girl.
It really says something when a serious movie has more clichÃ©s than a parody on the same subject.
This becomes extremely frustrating when the first time is revealed to have been a dream sequence, and the scene is repeated.
Her performance is superb--when she's on screen you can't take your eyes off her.
I should have immediately known this was a bad movie when the biggest names in it were washed-up sitcom co-stars.
I am kicking myself for not getting to a theater to see this when it was out last Spring.
She wears a red dress to a cotillion when polite society dictates that all the unmarried young ladies wear white.
I laughed at most of this movie when I should be biting my nails.
I remember back in the days of saturday childrens matinees, when they would show all of the old Godzilla movies, I mean I've seen them all!
A tell tale line of commentary was that when they said about the original subtle missile hits to Godzilla were more real and the suped up ones sound more fake.
Bette Davis and Henry Fonda were at their prime when they appeared in Jezebel.
This was a stage play, which by the way, was not very successful when Miriam Hopkins and Tallulah Bankhead appeared in it.
I snickered when I saw the horribly dubbed Japanese and the debut of Godzilla, the spaz in a rubber suit.
Well, I've seen the Japanese version on tape, and when comparing it with the US version, the Japanese version actually makes more sense.
The weird thing is that when Godzilla appears, he does absolutely nothing!
The back-story behind Warner Bros.' JEZEBEL -- itself widely regarded among critics and connoisseurs of the films of Bette Davis (and the late Thirties in general) as that of a consolation film given to Davis when the "hunt" for Scarlett O'Hara was in full swing -- is as long and convoluted as the tangled passions within the story shown on screen.
Davis, among a long list of actresses, were hungry to play this plum role even when it was already, contractually, and secretly secured to Vivien Leigh.
He sounds a bit to deep voiced and at one point when he laughs he goes "Ha, Ha, Ha", but other than him the dubbing is good.
and a truly kinetic, enthusiastic script by Hiroshi Kashiwabara and Wataru Mimura--the most telling line of dialogue in the movie, which could be used to describe the love and respect the writers have, occurs when a television reporter comments that the entire proceeding is "like something out of a 1950s science fiction film."
The Toho logo that appears during the opening credits reassured me that "Godzilla 2000" was taking me back to the good old days when Godzilla wasn't afraid to knock down a building or stomp down the military when they threatened him.
Leslie-Anne Down is properly coquettish and sluttish when her goals require it.
He was better covered when the prison sentences were handed out (because he planned the crime, and the others performed it).
Unfortunately, Preston isn't at the party because he is hammering out business at his family's bank; when they are married, he and Julie will be moving north, an almost sacrilegious action during this time.
One day, when Preston doesn't drop everything to attend a dress fitting for Julie that he had originally promised to attend, she defiantly insists that she purchase a red dress, breaking the white dress only tradition for the ball they were attending.
Despite the protestations of everyone she knows, including Preston, she wears the dress to the ball, causing her to be ostracized and the official break up of her engagement to Preston when he realizes that he cannot deal with her headstrong attitude.
I think that even when the film was made, (1938) the lines were still blurred as to how many freedoms and how much free-thinking should be afforded to women.
It is easy for me to say that Julie's red dress was much ado about nothing, but then again, this is the millennium, when nothing is overtly shocking anymore.
A different but equally sad truth is stated when Elizabeth accuses Erik of being, perhaps, the one who killed John and he concurs because he did kill John rather than returning a lesser, perhaps unmanned, husband.
Some historians believe that war is man's natural state of being and that would give this old movie currency beyond the coincidence of whether a big war is happening when the movie is viewed.
There is a delicious scene when Connery has a brief talk with the quite young wife of a much older banker.
The acting is very good with Sean Connery making a very likable villain but one who also has a dark side when needed, British ballet dancer Wayne Sleep did all his own stunts including scaling that prison wall while there are numerous other notable faces involved.
It only picked up a little bit when the heist goes down.
Crighton has said that when they were shooting the scene in which Connery is crawling along the top of the train, the coat he was holding accidentally was blown out of his hands but the actor stayed in character, turned around and retrieved it.
The elements of a great caper film are there: split-second decisions, tension and improvisations when plans go awry.
Julie shocks New Orleans society when she insolently comes to a ball wearing a red dress when it is the custom for all proper southern girls to wear white.
The Victorian setting is great; you start to wonder where Jeremy Brett (as Sherlock Holmes) is, and when he's going to catch these crooks.
the part which i liked best was when Julia was trying to undress a very weak and drowsy Brian!
He does have some star quality but he's very stiff when it comes to acting.
But when he's deep into the cave, he's suddenly wearing a loincloth.
The main character, Mike, freaks out when he sees a smashed overturned car.
It starts when the main character meets Bingo with delightful screams of "HOLY SH__!"
as well as the Parents bickering like 10 year-olds and giving each other the finger when they turn their backs.
the movie is a great movie for a cold day when you want to light the fire and watch a movie with the family or if there are many kids around for a party or something and you want to quiet them down.
Lt. Sims, De Toth's insistence paid off and he brought the completed film home two days ahead of schedule, despite this the film was shelved for 2 years and when eventually released failed at the box office, up until about ten years ago it was pretty much a forgotten film, with only one print known to exist.
But when Bingo himself winds up into trouble not only does it complicate things for him because of the crooks, it also complicates things for Chucky.
Pretty cheesy 80s film, few but strong horriable words, but yet the crooks do come up with a pretty (although sick) clever scheme when they get Chucky and Bingo.
Unfortunately too many people see only a kids film and judge it on that basis when in reality it is a movie aimed at adults poking fun at the films those self same adults enjoyed as children.
I know a lot of people on here gave this movie a bad review, but when I read those the only words going through my head are "What the f**k???"
"Candyman:Day of the Dead" is an incredible pile of garbage.The script is not only awful,but extremely predictable with a totally pathetic ending(I won't go into it,but you might kick in your TV set after viewing it).The acting is really pitiful,with dialogue to match.OK,there are some nice splatter scenes(I like especially the sequence in the car when one guy is slowly gutted),but the rest of the film absolutely sucks.To sum up,"Candyman:Day of the Dead" is one of the worst horror movies ever made-bland,boring and mind numbingly stupid and gets 3 only because of some pretty good gore.I really like bad horror movies,but this is an insult.Avoid it at all costs.Not recommended.
You know, it's the kind of scene where something or someone jumps into the scene (to say "boo" to the audience) when the director says "action", punctuated by excruciatingly loud cue music.
Instead, what we do get is the director making some glaring mistakes when he was aiming for some gory scene, no real sense of horror, a nonsensical plotline, the same type of cheap film used for most late night Cinemax flicks, several pointless lines, bad twists, and a lead actress with gigantic breasts who wears a tight shirt and no bra at all times.
There's also one scene during the festival when a cop is running after Donna, it seems reminiscent of another movie....oh yeah Double Jeapordy!!
It's a really bad sign when a sequel doesn't even get its own background story correct.
I remember when I was younger getting a peek at the movie on HBO, but I think I remember falling asleep, so it was at least something I could put to rest of what the rest of the movie was about.
It all just worked so much better when Jed was a well-off liberal, rather than a man who seems tantamount to being a vagrant, when Claire was a poetry enthusiast, when the audience was actually left in doubt, like Claire, about the state of Joe's mental health.
No, there isn't apparently an inquest, nor any police involvement, but it's not a documentary, it's a study of how people react the fallout of a violent event; it brings to mind Peter Weir's Fearless (1993), which examined the extent to which people withdraw when coping with severe stress.
The score and cinematography is as integral to the success of the film as the script, which I found perfectly satisfactory, although Tresdodge is right when he says the opening sequence of the ballooning accident is the best moment of the film.
The spectacular opening to the novel is faithfully captured here, when the main players quite literally drop into our lives.
I read the novel when it came out, and remember thinking after reading the last page, 'So what?'
Joe and Claire are about to share a romantic picnic when a stricken hot air balloon drifts into the field.
For film's of this type don't come around that often, and when they do it feels like a breath of fresh air.
Is it Jed whose love for Joe is unrequited, or is it perhaps Claire, who sees her life shattered after an innocent day when her life with Joe was at one of its best moments?
Do not miss this when it comes around again, I know I won't.
Why is the camera spying them when they are on their own?
Did I miss when the stalker falls in love with the guy?
What about when the guy goes, drunk, to see his friends and they let him hold the baby?, I think it's a very unpleasant film to watch.
A couple are about to open their Champagne and have a picnic in the beautiful Oxfordshire countryside when an out of control hot air balloon descends into their field, and, in so doing it perhaps disrupts or radically alters their lives forever.
STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs   One day,novelist and science lecturer Joe (Daniel Craig) takes his girlfriend Claire (Samantha Morton) out for a picnic in the beautiful English countryside.He has an ulterior motive-he means to propose to her.But then,suddenly and completely without warning,their lives are changed irrevocably forever when a red hot air balloon falls from the sky and a desperate struggle ensues to save the people on board.A man is killed and Joe is plagued with feelings of guilt and failure for sometime after.After a while,he does his best to put the incident behind him and move on with his life.But there's one person for whom doing that obviously hasn't been so easy for-fellow rescuer Jed (Rhys Ifans) who begins obsessively following Joe everywhere,leading him down a nightmare path of fear and madness.
Although he was apparently about the propose to his partner, Clare, before the accident in the opening scene, there is some unspecified strain in their relationship which prevents her being at all supportive when his problems begin, but what this is remains completely obscure.
And the fact that Joe never goes to the police (or even seems to consider involving them) even when Jed's stalking of him is well-established and increasingly disruptive, is a major plot weakness that's masked in the nuances of the novel but on screen looms fatally large.
Joe and Claire are about to enjoy a picnic when a hot air balloon comes almost "crashing" down in the field near them.
Just when they think they have the balloon under control, it takes off again, as if by a large gust of wind.
They can't hold it down and everyone lets go except for a doctor who was driving by when he witnessed the beginnings of the incident.
Sams is able to provide emotional momentum when the film otherwise cannot (see below), but it still perfectly fits the austere atmosphere.
Ida Lupino as 'Gemma' is cast adrift after a short union in marriage which produced a son, but she must fend for herself when tragedy ends the union.
An ex-con (Gene Nelson) with a beautiful wife and a good job sees his future prospects threatened when his old-time criminal partners call on him for help after a botched hold up.
This is a good instance of Flynn's natural ease on screen,and his sex appeal even when playing a cad in rags!
The byproduct is not funny, cannot be taken seriously (even when it wants to) and is not entertaining even to the most rabid Starwars fan (like myself).
He did not limit himself to the "box" when writing the film and had the attitude from "Field of Dreams"..."If you build it, they will come".
His son makes a last request for his father to continue to go see the movies without him and remember him when he does.
when your movie is lagging a bit towards the middle, put in a random fast paced event.
I remember the when, where and with whom of many, many movies.
Even a bad movie can be great when shared with the right friends.
And even when its bad, its still pizza."
A "Woodworks" film, "SSW" was written and directed by Gary L. Wood (who also wound up performing in the movie when a key actor failed to show up on "shooting day").
He started to curb joint efforts with Stanton and Anthony on woman's rights, claiming that it just was not the time (although his previous argument had been to strike when the fire was hot!).
The same situation happened in the English suffrage movement too, when Mrs. Pankhurst's daughters split on allying with the British Labor Party, and the anti-war movement.
Here's a movie I wish I'd seen when I was 16: edgy, almost lovable main characters that are weird enough to identify with and an interesting plotline that makes most other "teen" movies bow their heads in shame.
So when the movie turned out good, I was very pleasantly surprised.
I haven't figure out all, yet, but the scene of Seymour, his therapist & his mother tells you more about how similar Seymour and Enid are... she moves to live with Rebbeca and when his life crashes she will go to live with her father...there are many questions yet...and that scene is realy GREAT, it helps you to understand a little bit more about the story...
There are times when the clichÃ©s and caricatures can become a bit too heavy, but overall it works.
There's a theme of fakeness running through the film and several brief comedy scenes serve to illustrate that - like when Enid and her friend are sitting in a fifties "authentic" diner and 80's music comes through the juke box.
Its the first time in a young person's life when they can get out into the real world and see what lies in wait for them.
Anything that falls below their radar, you can bet Enid will have some witty rejoinder or dry comment dripping in sarcasm on hand, while Rebecca stands off to the side mulling it over and chipping in if and when necessary.
And when she does try to follow Rebecca's example, doing a regular job, its like watching a dog walk on its hind legs.
But when she actually gets Seymour a date, he starts spending less and less time with Enid.
Ghost World is the type of teen film you pray for, and when it finally comes, you almost feel like slapping yourself in astonishment.
Enid and her friend find the world out of school has little more to offer- The hypocrisy of graduation; when the class president speaks: "I liked her so much better when she was a crack head" Johannson sneers.
Johansson offers comic relief when Enid visits her at the local coffee house where she works: ..."mostly I just want to kill everyone"...
And this is a comedy that somehow works, even when burdened by such philosophical weight.
The way that the film start, when we can see how Enid and Rebecca spend their time, is really strange in consequence of the strange attitude of the characters .
I mean when they follow the "satanic" couple is really bizarre but later they just forget about them in less than a minute and they stop in a restaurant, and it's even more bizarre.
The lines of all the characters are really great and the critic to the ignorant society too, specially the scene when a man is looking for the film "8 1/2" by Fellini and the video clerk give him the film "Nine 1/2 Weeks" with Mickey Rourke.
In fact there are many teenagers out there who are rather intelligent, mature and wise beyond their years yet still like their basic humour associated with other peoples demise, which in this film, is done amazingly well and it is quite relatable when we see Enid and Rebecca laughing at the "satanists" in the diner.
They must dig and dig under all this modern pop culture to find the real hip stuff, the real cool stuff that our mothers and fathers listened to and watched when they were kids, and Ghost World is satisfying because its so up to date with the minority and yet references so many musicians, artists and films and its striking out to those MTV kids and others, the MTV kids who don't know who Pink Floyd is, or the ones who've never heard of the film Midnight Express or 8Â½ which is even mentioned in this film.
Enid and her best friend, Rebecca (a 15 year-old Scarlett Johansson) discuss how much they longed for their graduation day, and when it finally came, it wasn't as cheerful as they were expecting.
One week ago, when I was re-watching this movie with some friends who had never seen it, we commented on how miserable Josh is - and how sad it was to hear about Renfro's premature death a few days later.
And, when they find him, he tries to tell them to get out.
This movie doesn't believe high school is the root of youth complications; it knows that school isn't where the confusion lies-it's after graduation when the complexities begin.
However, when they meet this man, Enid becomes infatuated with him.
There's a brief emotional turning point for Enid when a cruel practical joke backfires and she becomes involved with the target, the nerdy and very sardonic Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who may just be the kindred spirit Enid was looking for.
I used to love watching this series when I was in about Grade 3.
And I haven't even mentioned the look on Jack's face when he finds out why Locke was "sorry", or the look on Alex's face when Sayid tells her that she looks like her mother.
I was disappointed also with Everett's performance which lacked the spark or energy shown by Jeremy Brett when he played Holmes in the TV series.
Holmes is so befuddled, he fails to see what we clearly see when it is discovered early on that the primary suspect's fingerprints do not match those taken from the crime scene.
I have read Conan Doyle's books, and i always thought that many of the actors, including the classic ones, came short when it comes to his arrogance and eccentricity.
A very good scene indeed is the moment when Holmes throws some dice to estimate depth... look out for it.
If holmes is believed to be born in 1854, then in 1903 he is 49, Rupert Everett was about 45 when he did the film so he was certainly in the correct age range.
I'll admit, I wasn't expecting too much when this appeared on CBC earlier tonight, but I was pleasantly surprised.
He also is intense and honorable when he's on a case, even a little vulnerable.
His camera has a distinct tone to it even when sets or usual shots in moving cars have to be done, and it cuts through the BS and keeps one riveted even as one knows what's going to happen (the last couple of minutes with Sims and the Lacey's are one of them).
This wasn't the Holmes I read when I was seven, just like Nigel Bruce was in no way the Watson I had adored also.
But anyone who has read Sherlock Holmes would know that Holmes used cocaine only when he had no case, when he was bored and listless and needed something to fill that seemingly interminable gap between cases.
No gasp of astonishment when Holmes revealed himself from a costume that by the way, seemed rather anachronistic of the late Victorian and early Edwardian era, just a look of slight betrayal and lack of amusement.
I'm hardly a historical expert on this, so I let them go mostly when I noticed them, assuming I was just ill-informed, and yet, they are somewhat advanced for the time period Holmes is and was intended to be set.
He is very calm and has very cool attitude when he's trying to solve a murder.
My understanding of the "real" Holmes is that he was bored in between cases, and that's when he enjoyed his 7% solution.
And yet, it does manage to convey just how those prison camps used other prisoners to operate the gas chambers, to carry out the deed with false promises--"Just be sure to remember where you hook the clothes so you can pick up your belongings when you leave"--and the backbreaking jobs of loading trucks with dead bodies and depositing them on chutes that go directly into a blazing furnace.
The film may have made little splash when it opened in 1954, but it's a near classic that fully deserves its growing reputation, and as the hardboiled cop who's all-knowing judge and jury, Hayden so effectively strides through the film like a colossus in a towering performance (literally: for much of the film he's shot from low angles) that it's impossible to imagine Bogart as being anything but a comparative disappointment in the role.
The plot is simple enough: a trio of escaped cons (Ted de Corsia, Charles Bronson when he was still Charles Buchinsky and Ned Young) kill a cop when robbing Dub Taylor's gas station for eating money and involve innocent parolee Gene Nelson, leaned on by cops and crooks alike, in their escape plans.
But the execution is what raises the bar here, particularly in the first third when the police bring in all the usual suspects.
Do not expect a pleasant movie-going experience when walking into the theater to see Grey Zone.
There are choices we all make to ensure our self-preservation, but there also comes a time when even amongst the worst of what humanity can wrought upon itself, there is hope.
Ultimately, it's about survival, and how we get our morals lost so easily when the instinct to stay alive kicks in.
The moment when he is confronted by a newcomer prisoner about to be guided to the gas chamber is the stuff of cinematic history in terms of acting: as Arquette tells his lies ("you'll be guided to the bath and soon will be reunited with your family", and so on), this scared newcomer, realizing his fate, confronts him and says "It's a lie, I can't believe it's Jews doing this job!I'm going to die, but I'm going to live longer than you ever will, you're dead already!!
When I saw the first few minutes of this film, and those horrible buildings and the piles of ash that were still there when I visited, it brought everything back, but told a story I didn't know much about.
This might not sound like a recommendation, but when you consider the film's subject matter, "painful" is actually a good word to describe THE GREY ZONE's brilliance.
That is why I remember Holocaust Memorial Day -- so that I will never forget -- and I can help work towards a time when such a hell will not occur in Europe, in Africa, in the Middle East, in the US, ... anywhere.
It's more about psychological deterioration, like the feeling you get when you haven't slept for many days and you start seeing things, imagining horrors, or getting paranoid.
A tailor is somewhat mediocre at his craft, and when his sister shows up on the scene and starts showing him up, well, he becomes a little nutso.
I've always found it neat when classic cartoons play famous songs to move the action along, and Friz Freleng's "Rhapsody in Rivets" adds to that.
In particular of note was when the two lesbian lovers first discovered themselves.
I think it is wrong when people attribute a certain quality to a community and expect that to be the their only quality.
By insisting, as the BBC does in their review of her film, that any treatment of Asian queerness needs to be portrayed as brutish and gritty, and that any story of an Asian family coping with a queer member must be shown through the lens of a "multicultural family and their troubled psyches", the press is putting the same straight-jacket on Asian filmmakers, as they do on black filmmakers, when they insist that the only stories that can come of out the black community are stories of gun violence and rat-infested squats.
This said, Cap and Skull are well-developed, and they hold the film together when it threatens to go over-the-top in its comic-book silliness.
He is preserved there until the 1990's, when he get resurrected and he realizes Red Skull is still alive and healthy, because the serum has allowed him to last this long.
Then we cut to a poor child actor telling his mum that he's going to be president of the USA when he grows up (FORESHADOWING!).
This film stuck pretty close to the character and I think people should give it more of a chance, I really hope that when the new Cap film is released in the next couple of years people go back and re evaluate their opinions.
On a positive note, the action scenes aren't awful when the viewer finally gets to them.
It was only later when in college film school that I recogized his true genius.
My favorite part is when Keaton has rescued the train and his girlfriend and they are escaping the federal troops in full pursuit.
Or when he throws the chunk of wood at the cannon.
And he absolutely floored me when he said after he watched the whole thing he thought it was great "but I prefer Chaplin".
Seems he has been digging into my DVD collection when I wasn't watching.
And he absolutely floored me when he said after he watched the whole thing he thought it was great "but I prefer Chaplin".
Seems he has been digging into my DVD collection when I wasn't watching.
Another of my favorite scenes is when Keaton knocks an obstructing beam off the track with another beam.
Even though the GENERAL was sitting in a rail yard available in 1925 when this was being filmed, the railroad would not let Keaton use it.
They really do wreck the engine while filming one sequence, & it sat on the lot where it was wrecked until WW 2 when it was salvaged for scrap iron.
It's difficult enough to write comments for films around fifty years old but when were talking 'silent' there's another dimension of difficulty inasmuch as one is moving into a world of title cards and 26 frames per second.
Not only are his facial expressions when he realises that something has gone wrong on the train hilarious but one must also give him credit for doing most of his own stunt work!
I remember when I first saw this movie.
I really love the scene where the Union spies drop the wood down at him and when he looked up.
And if you noticed the looks on the faces of the Union officers when the camera cut to them, those were for real, because they were not told what was going to happen to that train!
To me, they are both nearly perfect and represent the best full-length material Keaton performed--at least when it comes to stunts and laughs.
This film is probably the best of his films when it comes to concept and consistency of the humor and plot.
It exists in a time when people were still getting quite used to movies and so there is a lot of space that doesn't get edited out to help people get a better sense of the context.
The plot and story are simple, but exist more than to just help the comedy move along--except at the end when the first story was accomplished.
The first one comes right at the beginning, when we see Johnny being followed by two kids and a woman, in a line much like a train.
The story is about a Confederate train driver (Buster Keaton) who gets his train and his girl back when they are stolen by Union soldiers.
Along the way are many comic classic moments, such as Keaton carefully standing on the cowcatcher and carefully using physics to knock off broken wooden ties that might derail the train, or when (at a moment of dejection) Keaton sits on the connecting rod that links the trains wheels and finds himself pulled into the locomotive barn while in a sitting positions.
The situation of fighting the Yankees during the second chase, and finding Marion Mack there "helping" him, are wonderful - especially when she judges which lumps of coal are pretty enough to be used to keep the engine fired (she throws away the ugly little ones).
A forlorn Buster sits on the crossbar of his train's wheels, so lost in thought he doesn't notice when the train starts to move, carrying him up and down in gentle arcs: stillness in motion.
Annabelle's father sees them from another room and is about to break things up when her brother enters and announces that Fort Sumter has been fired upon: the War Between the States has begun.
He's so miserable that he doesn't notice when he starts moving up and down, until just before the train enters a tunnel.
I love it when the Unionists break off the rail car to hinder The Texas.
Well, when the only thing you can say negatively about a film is the soundtrack, you can trust that the film itself is great if not the greatest silent comedy of all time.
Months pass, and Johnny, sad and alone, is piloting his train Â the General Â when it is stolen from him by the North.
Just when I thought the action couldn't possibly get any better, they somehow turn the choreography up a few notches in the final fight.
This was just weird Maybe something got wrong when they transformed it from play to manuscript for this didn't work at all.
It was the greatest musical event of the 80s but, when I bought the DVD, I asked an attendant where it was located.
I thought it was really well done... when's the next one?
Remember this is in an era before the internet, mobile phones, when even sending and receiving an international fax was hit and miss.
Less movement, and when there finally is movement, it seems off.
It's probably the only time in our history when people joined hands globally to help people in need.
The funniest part is when the big battle is going on at night in the streets and Louis Calhern is casually driving his chariot home from the saloon totally oblivious to whats going on around him.
There's not much for the mind or the spirit here, but there's plenty to entertain, from Joseph Wiseman hamming away like nobody's business, even doing an imitation of a teapot in one bizarre shot, to the most imaginative Breen Office-approved sadism this side of Sodom and Gomorrah Â not only do we get willing sacrificial victims swan diving into fiery pits and a fight with a stuffed vulture but when people get the knife, they get it literally in the neck, which is a pretty neat trick.
Even when they weren't very good, those widescreen Biblical epics of the 1950's were usually "fun" in a campy sort of way.
Micah is about to get married to a beautiful but ordinary girl but when he sees Turner, he drops the girl and tries to woo Turner.
As a black person from the U.S., it was interesting to hear Danish Muslims referred to as "niggers" when they looked like white folks to me.
I guess all non-whites are "niggers" when you feel threatened by immigrants.
I assume many people will watch it just to see Lynda Carter topless, but in today's world where porn sites pop up on computers all the time even when they are not wanted, there is no novelty in seeing a topless woman in a love scene - except that it's a celebrity and people are into that.
There's only one word that you can describe when talking about Lynda carter and her role in Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw.
That's when Lyle Wheeler enters the picture.
Lynda Carter and Belinda Balaski are the standouts in the cast, primarily when they cast off their duds!
N. Refn's 2nd feature is cutting it pretty close when it comes to assessing life's terrible lessons.
However, I was only a few minutes in to the feature when I suddenly realized that I was in for a real treat!
There are many gay-themed films which harken back "to that time when I was 12..." Most are very poor at recapturing the feel or look of "the era," and terribly written and acted at that.
Usually when I hear the term "indie film", I roll my eyes and think, "Oh great.
Just when you think, "Oh, I know what's going to happen next!
One of the directors, Kerry Douglas Dye was present at the screening and he told us that his intentions when writing the script was to always go for the less obvious and try to avoid all Hollywood clichÃ©s.
I was immediately interested in this film when I saw the movie trailer.
Things gets complicated between the last two when the guy starts beatin' his pregnant girl and the brother's threatin' to retaliate.
The three boys (especially Phoenix) make the most of their situation when they discover a way to create their own spaceship and decide to take it for a spin.
I first saw Explorers when I was 6, not long after the movie came out and still remains a film that can be watched again.
The only bad comment i have on the film is the 2nd half when they actually encounter the aliens.
Well worth a purchase on DVD when it comes out.
We really lost a great new movie star when we lost River Phoenix.
The sight of the ThunderRoad flying over the American continent is exhilarating, especially when they crash into a drive-in, and are intercepted by a police helicopter, ironically being mistaken for a UFO.
But when the ThunderRoad goes into orbit, the story takes an odd turn.
That in itself is not so unexpected, but when we have aliens performing stand-up routines and quoting Bugs Bunny, it's hard not to think the film's gone off course.
), but when it finally got a limited release here in the UK it got very good reviews indeed.
The actors are brilliant all around, especially Mads Mikkelsen who does a fantastic performance as a filmgeek, with major problems when it comes to talking and being around girls.
Loved it when I first saw it.
I don't care what anybody says this movie sparks the imaginations in kids and let's them believe that anything is possible when it comes to dreams!
This movie is magical for me, because it reminds me of a time in my life when I used to believe in dreams, imagination and friendship.
The movie has a certain feeling about it,it is hard to explain, but the only way I can explain it is that when you watch it,you want to be apart of the movie and be,well,an explorer.
But when they finally reach their destination and meet the aliens, they are in for a complete shock and find something entirely different than what they were prepared for.
Unfortunately when the kids do reach space the whole thing completely falls flat.
The first half of this movie is fantastic, especially when they decide to build a ship to put into the force field they've managed to create.
I was 14 when I went to the theater back in '85 to see this movie.
I found myself wanting more story when it was over.
The kids narrowly escape the ship when the aliens' Dad (!)
This movie has so much going for it--terrific performances, great special effects, wonderful music by Jerry Goldsmith--that it really is a shame when it falls apart.
The humor comes from strange places, and truly lands in bizarro world during the last act, but it captured my imagination seamlessly when I first saw it at the age of eleven.
I had the pleasure of seeing this movie with my parents when I was ten and I really enjoyed it.
It features some of the early performances by Ethan Hawke and River Phoenix, back when they were young and enthusiastic performers.
i saw it when i was pretty young and absolutely loved it, as i do much of Dante's flicks from this time - The Burbs, Gremlins, InnerSpace - and i still love it to this very day.
A theme which only arrives half way through the film, when their craft is almost finished in its building.
After you've lived in a system in which you may have paid 40 dollars for rent, 5 for telephone or 10 for electricity, it becomes completely absurd when your bills take most of your salary, as in the Capitalist society most of us live in, to pay for the wealth of the Earth that belongs to every single soul on this planet.
On top of that, foreign official in Georgia Pier Lewis, who constantly makes fun of the company's methods (as cutting power for a few minutes in an airport for not paying its bills, when a plane was about to land) and the Georgian people's reactions, is a rather pathetic character, making one wonder if he's ever heard the word humanism.
What problems do you expect as an American "global power company" when you purchase the former national power distribution company of the Georgian capitol Tbilisi?
Some of the most touching moments come when Devlin decides to show us some of the beautiful Georgian countryside, or zoom in on a child's face.
Angela Bettis (tv's "Carrie") give a solid performance as a new resident who suspects something more sinister than her neighbour's scene-readings are taking place when she beings hearing noises, hammering and screaming emanating from within the walls of the building itself.
Everyone stated it was excessively gory and violent, however when I watched it I didn't think it was too bad.
Again when the police arrive the body is gone..... What would have been better is if he would have won, and killed the victim in the way he tried to (sawing her in half) - but that's just my sick opinion.
Then he was King of the World when he directed POLTERGEIST.
If you think it hurts seeing a cool guy like Peter Jackson do big budget crap like KING KONG, it's even worse when a cool guy like Hooper does no budget crap like CROCODILE.
It is a remake of one of the most infamous exploitation movies of the 1970s, but you know that you have problems when you cannot improve upon such dubious material.
But trying to make a movie based upon a play in 1912 when cinema was silent is quite difficult; so if you haven't read the play, is possible that sometimes you find yourself puzzled about what is going on, although restored titles summarize the plot well.
I recommend this movie to all Shakespeare loversÂ, a long time go I watched the movie made by Lawrence OlivierÂ, like tooÂ Keep in mind that this movie was done when cinema tricks, like editing or crosscutting, was yet not in use; so the way of filming is quite simple: they put the camera and shoot all the scenes in a medium shotÂ, there is only a brief shot closer to RichardÂ, reminds me all the movie the Frankenstein made by Edison in 1910.
On one sight,we have masterpieces like Poltergeist,Salem's lot and The Texas chainsaw massacre(1974).On the other sight we have craps like Lifeforce,Funhouse and the remake of Invaders from Mars.With this thing,I wanna say that when there's an opportunity to see a Tobe Hooper's film,it's very possible that we can see a masterpiece or a crap.Toolbox murders(2004)is not a masterpiece and it's not a bad film...it's a good horror film which kept me very fun.A very little quantity of people will remember the original film,The Toolbox murders,made in 1978,which,by my point of view,is a very mediocre and clichÃ©d film.This remake is a lot better than the original movie(surprise!
I therefore wasn't expecting much when I picked up his remake of The Toolbox Murders.
Right from the beginning when the camera is filming through a sheet of plastic in the rain, it manages to give off a downright unsettling atmosphere.
She becomes quite wary of the place almost immediately, and becomes especially concerned when Julia (Juliet Landau, daughter of Martin), a friendly new acquaintance, disappears.
Practically only old houses possess these creaky beams, that stale odor that comes out of the walls, the characteristic noise when the wind presses against the windows, the howling of an old elevator, etc.
There is a constant-sound of hammering, even when the workmen are gone.
Immediately, she despises the building with it's strange tenants, shady repairman, broken fixtures, and when she notices that the residents start disappearing, she investigates - discovering it may have something to do with markings engraved on the walls (forgive me for that long ass sentence).
It's been subdued for decades - but when renovations start, a series of murders take place.
The specific treat here lies in the man who introduces the film--both on screen without costume and, when the film played, traveled the country to both introduce it and speak to the audience between reels)--the 19th-Century stage actor Frederick Warde.
A youthful 61 when he made the film, he hunchbackingly runs and plots and creates on-screen emotion via hand and facial expressions.
Similarly, the photography creates fine atmosphere when needed, with the picture often looking like a cross between the colorful sets of "May" combined with the slight grittiness of Zack Snyder's "Dawn of the Dead" remake.
I first seen Tarzan Finds a Son when I was quite young and have seen it several times since.
But Tarzan and Jane have become rather attached to their little tyke, and aren't about to give him up, especially when they discover that two of the visitors only want Boy for his vast inheritance.
The baby, who they name Boy, was orphaned when the plane he was flying with his parents crashed in the jungle.
So the writers have thought up a the solution to the problem:   A young British couple (Morton Lowery and Laraine Day), aboard a private airplane with their infant baby, learn that they are in danger when the plain acquires engine trouble.
What is it about the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films that seem to be as entertaining today as they were when first released.
"Cheetah find" is his answer when Jane questions where the baby came from.
The story is about Tarzan and Jane acquired "boy" (Johnny Sheffield) when the latter was five years old.
She was taking dictation from Gregory La Cava, who was preparing to cast "The Age of Consent", when, giving her a second look, he organised a screen test.
The ending is pretty dramatic - Nigel and Dora are waiting for a preacher, when word comes of a dreadful car accident - Duke is dying and Nigel rushes to Betty's side.
There is also a subplot involving Professor Mathews and Barbara (Aileen Pringle), a teacher and confidante of Betty's , who had faced the same dilemma when they were young, decided not to marry and lived to regret it.
But when Betty says they should wait until they graduate before they marry (two whole years!
Oh, I pine for the days when that mighty Viking, the Swedish Chef, still roamed Scandinavia, stamping out all such crap with one swing of his frying pan.
The Bergen (Norway) Cinema director in 1995 had the sense - at the time when this ghastly film was first (and never again!)
He stated when interviewed that to show this to an audience of adults would be adding insults to the injuries already inflicted on other unsuspecting cinema goers.
later, when they think (not talk) about the American car which has been driving on dusty American desert roads since the fifties, and it is a mid-sixty car!
You'll love the comic in France when Aune enter a coffee shop, randomly running into a former girlfriend, while wearing Rollerblades.
Speaking of Florence Rice, she literally lights up the screen when she is on.
The movie sounded interesting when it first came out but somehow I missed seeing it when it came out and, years later when it came to television was really looking forward to seeing it.
The problem is when a movie's THIS slow going on action it runs the risk of losing it's audience when something DOES happen.
One thing about this movie that made me feel good was when Grace (Julia Roberts) confronted Eddie (Dennis Quaid) for being unfaithful to her.
She was raised in a town very concerned with two things - doing the right thing, and talking about it when someone else is caught doing the wrong thing.
What was Robert Duvall thinking when he agreed just to go through the motions for this dud?
How could you trust that man for one second and be surprised when he cheats?
I agree that often, when women cheat in films, it's somehow justified and the man who cheats is vilified.
I had to think when I watched "Camille Claudel."
Daddy is finally made to pay the consequences for his own extra-marital dalliances when Rowlands finally locks him out of their house.
This is one of those movies that is one of a kind, but not one you'd want to watch very often for it hits deep within our souls(especially those who have gone thru similar experiences) and therefore I think it failed when released because the exec's didn't know how to sell it to make money but none-the-less it is a classic in my book on relationships.
We feel bad for HIM when he makes it sound like she drove him into another woman's arms because she didn't give him enough affection.
I also want to bring attention to the fact that Julia Roberts was about 27 when she made this.
She has a GREAT scene when she confronts her club about her husband's infidelity.
Until then, we can only hope filmmakers will have more integrity when exploring such territory.
But when his guardian grandmother passes away, Carlitos begins to plot his way to get himself to the LA within the week, to look for Rosario lest she calls home and worries that he's missing.
She left him when he was five to work as an illegal housekeeper in Los Angeles.
However, when his grandmother dies, Carlitos decides to cross the US/Mexican border with the help of two young Chicanos (America Ferrara and Jesse GarcÃ­a), since doÃ±a Carmen, la coyote (Carmen Salinas), refuses to help him, due to a promise made to Rosario, Carlito's mother, even though she handles an illegal crossing business.
The drama centers on a little Mexican boy, Carlitos (Adrian Alonso), who lives with his ailing guelita (grandmother) in Mexico; when she suddenly dies in her sleep, he sets off to Los Angeles to be reunited with his mother, who's been working as a maid for rich folks.
There was only one other person in the theater when I recently saw this movie at a local multiplex late at night: An Hispanic gentleman.
Unfortunately, the tears flow much too easily, even when the situation doesn't quite earn them.
While writing this, it makes me flashback to the film "The Straight Story" when an old man on a tractor drives 300 miles across Iowa to see his long-lost brother.
Very young guy confined to wheelchair by hysterical paralysis mixed with partial traumatic amnesia produced by the parent-killing car wreck occurring years ago when he was a child meets but of course doesn't recognize young chick who drove the car that caused the accident and is now obsessed with the idea of becoming a paraplegic like him aka like the kid in the car she crashed into.
This simplistic view of two "mental illnesses" gets dressed up with 1) obsessed chick arranging to meet (and sleep with, equally of course) wheelchair bound guy via the plot device of anonymously informing him of a human interest story (he is an NPR-radio-station-type reporter) 2) utterly stupid 'human interest story' (an urban legend style boffo about a bunch of people who "wannabe" paralyzed for no particular reason whatsoever) 3) "magic fred astaire shoes" (of course, again, the shoes are nothing more than a mental "crutch" the guy is subconsciously using to give himself a reason to walk... that enable wheelchair guy to walk...after falling down a lot, only very slowly, with crutches or a cane...sort of like you'd expect someone who has been working out to retard muscular atrophy but who hasn't stood or walked for years to behave when finally standing and walking... 3) a few couldabeengreat lines that came off as too silly to be taken half-seriously because of the trying-to-be-an-allegory but frankly rather silly plot.
Before the half of the movie I presumed the big twist about the Nick's character but it was hidden and portrayed in a fine way that when the answer is shown to the audience, you don't feel so much surprise but also you don't feel cheated in any way.
Consequently, the ending which was very beautiful cinematographically with a touch of reality that makes it absolutely delicious that leads to pause when Nick's character ends the film with the line: Isacc Knott, Public Radio, New York.
In other words, when intellectual Hollywood lightweights leach onto such phrases or words, without really having the cortical ability to get beyond your average video game, the outcome is never very good.
I couldn't help reminiscing about 'Spider ' and other Cronenbergs when viewing, QPQ's style's not totally unlike the fore-mentioned but if some reading at the moment fear 'boredom' (I would never dare to call Cronenberg 'boring' but I can understand why some might would be inclined to), I can assure you QPQ makes for a very accessible film.
Interestingly, Isaac is a paraplegic, confined to a wheelchair since age 8 when he was the survivor of a car crash that killed both his parents.
Isaac surprises himself (and shares his surprise with Fiona) when he buys a pair of 'Fred Astaire shoes', and upon trying them on, he is able to walk!
The romance between Scott and Dunne just isn't very interesting and you would be best off by skipping the parts when Dunne sings.
Court cases are always interesting when human stories are involved and this is a human story-not something to do with organised crime or fraud.
I admit it -- I am a sucker for a certain type of Steve Martin movie ("The Jerk," "L.A. Story," and of course "My Blue Heaven") -- the days when he was choosing to make stuff that was wonderful mix of funny and sweet.
Musical about Randolph Scott and Irene Dunne falling in love when he inherits a dress shop (named Roberta's) in Paris.
True to being full of exaggeration, watch how Vinnie (Martin) talks his way out of grand theft auto when talking to Hanna Stubbs (Cusak) a prudish assistant DA.
This movie is from the period when Rick Moranis and Steve Martin were still at the very top of the comedy-genre.
Helen is the aunt from whom Scott inherits Madame Roberta's Dress Design when she dies.
Meanwhile, Vinnie soon tires of his new life and resorts to crime - first little things, such as marking down prices on meat in the local grocery store - which results in the best single line in the entire film, when a perky employee greets Vinnie.
Which is why I don't understand its small impact when it first arrived in theaters.
I get angry when younger people talk about the funniest movies of all-time and mention Adam Sandler and Will Ferrell movies because they have never seen an Allen picture.
My favorite scene is when he is in his apartment with Diane Keaton waiting for a blind date to arrive.
He starts putting out books and Jr. High track medals to impress her and then when she arrives he can only grunt at her greeting.
Because his apartment is a shrine to all things Humphrey Bogart (the movie begins with Allan at an art-house movie theatre at the end of CASABLANCA), it's no surprise when Bogart makes his own appearance and gives Allan pointers about how to react to women while telling him what went wrong.
It's just time when pressure from Bogart and Allan's own growing gumption will make him take the next step.
Bogart suddenly materializing in the background, in shadows, is priceless (and Jerry Lacy virtually channels Bogart's mannerisms and voice down to a science), but so is a sequence when Allan and Linda are sitting on the sofa.
It's part of Allen's way of paying homage to the classic films that were made when he was growing up, and he would return to this again in THE PURPLE ROSE OF CAIRO with equally clever results.
Always on the short end of the stick when it came to having relationships with women the divorce to his wife Nancy, Susan Aspach, just about destroyed whatever confidence he had with the fairer sex.
It's both funny as well as sad when we see Dick and his best friend Allen talk over Dick's fears of losing his wife Linda and blaming himself for her leaving him by not paying any attention to her but being too involved in his job.
Things become complicated when Linda and Allen become more than just platonic, and one night things go to the next level.
Loaded with more than a few brilliant visual touches (like Roberts's Dick walking into the ocean solemnly in a 'what if' moment, or when Linda pulls the gun on Allen in another 'what if' moment at the airport), and a climax that keeps any fan of Casablanca, or at least anyone who knows how the scene goes- which should be almost anyone considering it's classic cinematic folklore at this point- with a smile cheek to cheek.
But when even the nymphomaniac complains about his getting fresh, he realizes it won't be so easy.
Eventually, the inevitable happens when Linda and Allan fall in love.
He even the spirit of Humphrey Bogart act as his adviser when he faces romantic complications since Bogie always knew how to treat his women.
I detest slapstick and even as a child I could never understand why an audience laughed when people got poked in the eye (the unspeakable Three Stooges), fell down (the mawkish, tiresome Charlie Chaplin), or ran into and destroyed things (the ineffable Ritz Brothers).
Woody is absolutely lovable, I almost choked when watching this movie while I was eating because of uncontrolled laughters, especially the scenes of his first date after the divorce.
Diane is very pretty in this movie, although I think now she looks rather cruel when she is serious, but man i liked her dresses so much I hardly noticed her acting (sorry, can't help it as a girl).
Back in the day when Woody was just as slapstick as he was verbal, "Play It Again, Sam" tells the story of Allen as a divorced film critic crushed by the failure of his marriage.
Woody Allen films are always best when Woody himself stars in them; his neurotic persona is a great base for laughs, and he certainly delivers in this film!
Sam and Dean are nevertheless investigating the case, because the state of the victims' bodies indicate that the little critters weren't behaving normally when they attacked.
Construction is delayed when beetles kill a construction worker.
He also explains that John does care about Sam and checked on Sam all the time when he was at college.
Dean's smirk when he calls Sam "honey" makes me smile.
When the agent dies with spider bites in her bathroom, Dean and Sam discloses that the area is a land cursed by Indians many years ago, when they were annihilated by the American soldiers.
STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs   A serial killer by the name of The Black Angel is on the loose in a college campus,slaying girls or boys without discrimination.College party animal Jimmy Scott (Kevin Costner) falls under the heavy eye of Detective King (William J Kulzer) a short-fused,foul-mouthed detective driven by his own personal needs to track down the killer on account of his own daughter's savage killer not being found years before.But when Judy (Elizabeth Trosper) one of the sexiest girls on the campus starts getting heavy breathing phone calls,it looks like she may become the next target if King can't find the killer in time.
Do not expect anything spectacular when you rent this movie.
It's really the kind of movie you get when you put a bunch of people together who think they have what it takes to make a decent film, but don't.
I knew this had to be quality when I put in the DVD and the Vestron Video logo popped up?
Coffee, the plot concentrates initially on newly married John and Elizabeth McDonald, who are suddenly separated when he enlists for combat duty during WWI.
However, John knows her, and they become intertwined again when their son Drew decides to enlist in the RAF years before the U.S. enters WWII.
Colbert is her naturally effervescent self, though she is well into her forties here and a mite too mature for the early scenes when she is playing a blushing newlywed to the twelve-years younger Welles.
A very human and poetic love story during the Pinochet's dictatorship is shown in La Frontera, when oppositors were sent to little villages far away from everything and a series of strange relations start.
The scene in the bar when the men are dancing between them is just memorable.
I watched it until I was 15 when it was canceled, and still thoroughly enjoyed it.
I had my doubts about this film, I've seen many Chinese films and I know when there bad, there bad but when there good, man are they good.
The plot twists and turns and just when you think you can predict it...
I bought it on DVD and I was laughhing so hard when he talks bout his baby mama and not stressin ur kids off.
Why would Satain the Bunny (I refuse to call him Rancid Rabbit) change his voice when he yells at a person (Cat)that he hates most?
I know I can relate to others when I state that I thought this show was absolutely terrible when it first came out.
The show is about Fry a 21 year old pizza delivery boy who always wanted to be an astronaut and when he accidentally gets himself chrogenically frozen and wakes up in the year 3000.
However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred.
He gets dumped by his girlfriend while delivering a pizza and when he parks his bike to make the delivery someone steals it.
The only problem with Futurama is that it was released by the same people who created The Simpsons and at the time when The Simpsons had just finished their best years.
This led to immediate comparisons between the two shows and people were expecting the Simpsons in space when they saw months of advertising about a show by the same creators of the Simpsons set 1000 years in the future.
They took everything they learned when working on The Simpsons and applied it, though overall I do prefer that to this.
Some of the endings include the ending to Jurassic Bark, when a flashback shows that Fry's dog in the past had waited next to the pizza parlour for Fry to return for the rest of his life.
For some reason, Futurama is nowhere as good when Comedy Central makes it.
It started near the beginning, when I pressed the fast-forward button because Andy was going to the video store on his bike and they just showed gratuitous shots of his determined face and peddling feet for SO LONG that I began to doubt that there was an end to it.
And then when he left the video store, they showed more minutes-on-end of Andy just peddling home.
All I remember about the movie was that he went to the video store and met some creepy guy and rented a silver videotape and went home to his sister and when his sister watched the video, she was sucked into the t.v.
This movie shocked me with its lameness when I was 10, which really says something about how it sucks.
Then when we cut to close-ups of Andy's face, we are in a big, extremely fake looking set with a whole different video quality, with Andy sitting behind one metallic prop, with an orange light in the background to make it seem "starshipp-y".
The character of Whitey also has a heart and this is shown perfectly when she tells Linda to go back to Van or she (Whitey) won't turn him away when he turns to her.
I don't think that attraction to Whitey would ever have won out over his devotion to Linda, but it was obvious he would turn to Whitey when Linda filed for divorce.
The title suggests a comedy, but it's more like a fluffy drama about a woman who starts to become jealous when her husband lavishes too much attention on his secretary.
In a fascinating scene that takes place between Gable and Harlow in a Haitian hotel, the film suggests that the key to making relationships work lies not in avoiding temptation (which it also suggests is impossible anyway), but in knowing how to say "no" to it when it arrives.
The conflict starts when Linda Stanhope's (a gorgeous Myrna Loy) mother in law makes a careless comment about how nice her son's (a dashing Clark Gable) Â Linda's Husband - secretary (played by Jean Harlow) is.
Myrna Loy vs. Jean Harlow, and when the man in question is Clark Gable in his prime, I'd fight over him too.
There are times when you don't know who to cheer for - the Wife or the Secretary - and that's the movie.
So, when one interviewee mentions the three cameras used to take the pictures at Abu G, we get a special effects image of each camera model floating in space as if this were some revelatory moment.
The explanation is phrased in different ways but when the broth is reduced it comes down to, "I was just following orders."
According to one of the guards, when the pictures were made public there was a thirty-day amnesty period, during which a frenzy of shredding and other forms of cover-up went on.
That's when you know what the boss wants done without his or her having to tell you explicitly.
The plot threads start to feel unwieldy after a while, but journeyman director William A. Seiter is smart enough to know when to include the musical interludes.
One doesn't leave "Standard Operating Procedure" necessarily more enlightened that when one went in - just more well-informed.
Usually you just get things like, "It was cold the day when we shot this," or "We had to get up at 4 AM that day."
They do admit their process included sleep deprivation, hypothermia, loud noises, and also, when they lost patience or just felt like it, random physical abuse.
It's all prefaced by a description of what a disgusting place Abu Ghraib was when the MPs and other American staff came to live there--with constant bombardment, because, in violation of international law (but we are not told that) Abu Ghraib was not behind the lines.
John is disgusted when he sees it on her and they break up for the last time.
"When you dance you're charming and so gentle/Especially when you're doing "The Continental"!!!
Everyone simply goes through their paces, carries out the mission and in 90 minutes, we've learned nothing about them and can't care less when some of them get killed.
He sweeps Ginger off her feet in the last scene, but when she proposes to him he's inarticulate - but he says yes, of course.
Colbert quickly remarries a wealthy gentleman who is most sympathetic when this apparent tragedy strikes.
Even when the war begins it is original enough that put it from the point of view of the three enclosed in the station.
But later, when they come to the devastated Earth, everything changes.
His character is the only one in the film who emerges as an actual person, and when the story shifts it's emphasis away from his fate it looses that central core of interest.
I think this movie, for what it is and when it was made, is a very good effort.
I saw this film when it first came out and the disappointment of my memory holds up today.
A space station witnesses the third world war and a trio of survivors wait for the radiation levels to drop so they can return to Earth , and when they return they find that the survivors are well armed barbarians where it's survival of the fittest   This movie doesn't concern itself with the intellect of post apocalypse authors like John Wyndham or John Christopher , it's trying to be similar in genre to the likes of MAD MAX etc .
A nuclear warhead equipped space station is circling above the stratosphere when the unthinkable happens.
I first saw this film when I was nine years old and it scared me to death.
It was all recorded directly when the film was shot on a sound stage most of the time and the microphones were still very primitive.
I got interested in daddy Laughton when I was 17Âby way of Pacino, in whose life Laughton had the place of a mentor, it is said.
MacGoohan's followers insist on chanting a sardonic mantra, "THE KING'S LAW, THE KING'S LAW", when discussing the revenue laws.
I have been lucky enough to have this fashion parade comedy musical film in my life since the mid 70s when New Zealand TV stations sent all their old 16mm prints to Australia for junking.
Jamaica Inn is so over-the-top it's a delight to watch, especially when Laughton is chewing the scenery.
I know what to do with money when I have it which is why I must have it.
You've got the screen debut of Maureen O'Hara, who's playing a young woman who gets involved with a group of pirates when she travels from Ireland to England to stay with her aunt Patience (Marie Ney) and her abusive husband Joss (Leslie Banks).
I suppose on a certain level the film is a warning about the deception of appearances -- Joss starts to seem like a more sympathetic character than Sir Humphrey, especially when he essentially sacrifices himself for Mary (O'Hara) towards the end.
For example when James (Newton) has gathered the troops and is trying to arrest Sir Humphrey, he stops by Sir Humphrey's estate just long enough for one of his foppish hangers-on to comment "hey, you're wearing my uniform!"
There's no two ways about his wickedness, he's a perfect cad - just catch the way he sizes up Maureen O'Hara's character when she first makes her appearance at his home.
The DVD released in Brazil by Continental Distributor has 89:41 minutes running time and it is visible the edition of the movie when Mary and Trehearne are lodged by Sir Humphrey.
As in most Hitchcock films there is a lot of sexual innuendo without any sex on screen, especially when Pengallen (Charles Laughton) makes the young girl (Maureen O'Hara) his prisoner.
Randolph Scott has a big, clean, very handsome, American quality that is also wonderfully suited to this part - one in which his character is candid, straightforward, easily swayed by others who are sophisticated -but at a certain point will act decisively when he comes to realize his judgment has been mistaken.
Ruthless and vindictive at anyone who as much as meekly disagreed with him Brady nurtured a slew of enemies who, when the time came, descended upon him like vultures on a dying corpse in the wild.
Brady went so far as getting involved with the mob who's head man Johnny Mazia, Robin Morse, he helped out, from going to jail, when he was a teenager.
This happened when Brady got wiped out in the stock market and was deeply in debt to Mazia's gang in him losing over $200,000.00 in his gambling with Mazia's illegal bookies.
The final shoe to drop is when Brady gave the go ahead for Mazia to whack former gang member Morris Lazetti, John Mansfield, who was to turn states evidence against both him and Mazia in their criminal activities.
I originally saw the film when it came out and only saw it again recently.
Scenes from the film have stayed with me and I wasn't disappointed when it ran on TV.
It's about the corruption of a municipal machine that focuses on demobbed doughboy John Payne who, when his older brother dies, inherits his political clout.
Based on the story of Boss Tom Pendergast of Kansas City who ruled the roost there succeeding brother Jim from World War I until the outbreak of World War II, John Payne delivers a riveting portrayal of a political boss back in the day when these guys were at their heights running our nation's cities.
The gunfight sequence at the train station is directly drawn from the famous 'Kansas City Massacre' of 1933 when 'Pretty Boy' Floyd, Adam Richetti and Verne Miller mowed down several F.B.I.
They all involved a gigantic Pokemon set on destroying the world, when in fact they have "good" intentions.
Check it out and see if you can hate Orson when he flashes you that smile.
Imagine my excitement when I was staying with my French exchange partner and he suggested we go to a cinema in Angers to see "Le Troisieme Homme".
Carol Reed was at the height of his powers when he made "The Third Man", but he still had something almost as great to give before his slow decline.
I envy anyone seeing this for the first time; I was young when I first saw it and was quite entertained, but couldn't get the most out of it.
And of course there is the desperation of the ruthless and clever Harry Lime (Orson Wells) when he is chased in the sewer.
He changes his mind, however, when he is invited to speak to the members of a local book club.
It's the One Moment in the film when it seems that time (in a country that makes clocks, something that Lime makes a joking reference to later on) stops dead in its tracks.
Martins is a writer of western stories and it's bad when a writer starts believing he's one of his own heroes.
Having seen the restored copy that was shown at the Film Forum, recently, I could not resist watching this masterpiece once more when it was shown by TCM, the other night.
The music by Anton Karas is still haunting, with the exception of a few times at the beginning of a couple of scenes, when it startles the viewer and actually doesn't add anything to what we are about to see.
It explains the why and when of each song from The Black Album.
In Metallica's case, when this doco was made, I guess it was right on the back of the Load/Reload and S&M backlash.
What makes a mystery really good is when the audience is asking - literally minutes before the end - how are they going to do it?
When I first viewed this movie I thought it was ok, but when we bought the video it began to grow on me.
And even if it doen't, there's been no sign that it's going to ring an annoyingly long time when Emily starts moving to answer it.
Of course David was recording the murder plot, when Steven laid it out at his own apartment.
Michael Douglas, the loving yet control freak husband Steven, whose empire is falling apart and the only option he has is to kill his wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow, who works for the UN, speaks a few languages but is dumb as a doorbell when it comes to the men in her life.
A French film set in France in 1789 when the encyclopedia was banned.
Next, was when Diderot got a boner when seeing Madame Therbouche (Fanny Ardant) while she was painting a portrait of him naked. "
It is quite important to remember when watching comedies that humor is a very personal thing.
The right dating seems to be 1750's, when Diderot should have been about his 40, as it comes also from his daughter age and from Boucher's painting, which the company views during the sideshow in the end of the movie.
Now, when you come to see the movie, try to forget all you know (if you do) about the real Diderot and just enjoy the jokes, the funny situations and delightful absurdities of the movie.
It leaves you with a kind smile on your lips when the last frame makes its place to titles and a strong wish to watch it again immediately.
Vincent Perez as Diderot plays the character superbly wearing a delightful smile though not much else when he poses for his portrait by the beautiful Madame Therbouche, a so-called painter from Berlin though actually a spy arranged by the Cardinal.
There is one scene that combines the music with the scene (you'll know it when you see it) so well I would have purchased a ticket to see it alone.
It was the real punch-line for me, but when you hear it in context, it has much more force (therefore: not really a spoiler, more of an appetizer!)
Burt Lancaster plays a major during the Vietnam war when he was actually 65 years old and his age is impressed upon you in the first scene as he scrambles through the wire.
You can feel its setting itself up for a big one, and when it happens the 'you know what' really hit's the fan.
This film is set in 1964 when America's participation was limited to advisers by this time raised to about 20,000 of them by President Kennedy.
Platoon is set in the time a few years later when the USA was fully militarily committed in Vietnam.
This was when Americans in general had never heard of Vietnam.
***There are Spoilers*** Based on the 1967 Daniel Ford novel "Incident at Muc Wa" the movie "Go Tell the Spartans" shows how the US got slowly drawn into the disastrous Vietnam War in thinking it was both winnable and a noble cause when it fact, as history has shown us, it was anything but.
The film starts in that fateful summer of 1964 when the US Military had only an advisory involvement in helping the South Vietnamese Government in its war against the insurgent Communist Vietcong, known as Charlie to the GI's, who were overrunning the country.
Burt Lancaster loved the script so much that he contributed $150,000.00 out of his own pocket to finance "Go Tell the Spartans" when it's budget ran out with a couple days left to be filmed.
Director Ted Post is incredibly talented when it comes to telling the audience a captivating story.
This film never received the attention it deserved when originally released.
It's really worth your while and I hope when people see it in a video store they'll consider giving it a chance.
This exceptional, totally deromanticized and unjustly forgotten knockout got undeservedly lost in the shuffle in the late 70's when it had the grave misfortune to come out around the same time as such more widely recognized 'Nam features "The Deer Hunter," "Coming Home," and "Apocalpyse Now."
The film depicts the early stage of the war circa 1964, when American troops where initially sent over strictly as "military advisers."
I know Lon Chaney's characterization and performance must have been fascinating and when we see that outstanding make-up in a narrative fashion we want to see it move with life.
The narrative is pretty much intact even when they have trouble finding images for scenes.
I first read about this in Fred Olen Ray's fantastic "The New Poverty Row", so when I saw it for $5 at Grimsby Giant Tiger, I scarfed it up.
Eduardo willingly allows himself to be turned into a vampire by his mother's loving embrace, and when his father dies in tragic circumstances, he assumes the paternal role of feudal lord.
John Wayne looks marvelous in leather and delivers his lines like a true straight-man when partnered with Oliver Hardy.
There is action when the French are attacked by the evil river-men who want their land, and are in turn repelled by the Fighting Kentuckians,(the whole kit and kaboodle),lead by a trumpet-blowing Hardy.
Didn't Hollywood get this putrid mess out of their systems back in the 70's when filming all those abysmal James Bond dogs?

The only scene which really made me cringe was when Hale falls off the back of the truck & he then picks himself up, runs after it, catches it up & jumps on the back!
BROKEN ARROW may be required to take a deep long breath, because when it starts, it's a ripping action-packed joy ride complete with guns, explosions, action heroes, great baddies, helicopters, jeeps, chases and all under the great helm of Hong Kong action god John Woo, here having a filed day with special effects, stunts and style.
And when the theater does get dark, and the film starts, the action just keeps pouring in.
But I remember seeing the previews on TV, but not being able to see it in theaters because I was too young, so when it came out on video, I would ride my bike down to the video store to rent it countless times a month.
Now you know when a film has you and is entertaining.
Usually for me the indications are....1) I'm not bored 2) I'm not yawning 3) i don't have to make an excuse to goto to the toilet even when I don't need to.
If Travolta attempted this movie now instead of when he did - it wouldn't work.
The brothers' ability to deal with these problems and their other problems are examined in the light of the daily mundane tasks they take upon themselves when they arrive at the monastery.
This is the perfect movie to cheer you up when you're feeling blue.
The other brother, Uwe, ends up going along after drowning his sorrows when his wife leaves him.
He even copes better than his brother when they get lost and separated in Tokyo.
For example, the Japanese speak English when no one is around to overhear.
I first saw "C'est arrivÃ© prÃ¨s de chez-vous"(Man bites dog) about ten years ago and I was amazed by the whole thing.The darkest humor ever,sick violent scenes,and of course,the Man himself.Poelvoorde plays a violent maniac but he's funny and charismatic at the same time.Fast forward to 2005:I realised there was a new movie with that guy that I've never seen in another film.I didn't know that much about Claude Francois,but I had to see Poelvoorde in another role.Here he plays Bernard FrÃ©dÃ©ric,an ex-imitator of Cloclo.He stopped his "career" in show-business when his wife,VÃ©ro, gave an ultimatum.So now he has a boring job,9 to 5, a son, a "normal" life.
But when he learns that there is an imitator contest on prime time TV,his passion takes over.So many funny scenes in this movie!
This scenario has its moments and they are numerous like when it comes to showcase and construe FrÃ©dÃ©ric's apparently simple but complex persona.
He's a lackluster man when Claude FranÃ§ois isn't on his mind but when his passion for Claude FranÃ§ois has the upper hand and his determination to reform his female dance band make his demeanor with his surrounding hateful, obnoxious, on the brink of the unacceptable as the sequences when he selects his female dancers and then asks her questions (he has all the answers) about his god bear witness.
And they should details when they fed on people too.
Though I wasn't even born yet to watch the original series when it was on, I did watch it in reruns on sci-fi a few years ago before they took it off the air.
My mom was a big fan of the original, so she taped the new series when it aired and I loved every minute of it.They need to put it on DVD now so everyone can see it that hasn't watched it or wants it in their movie collection like I do.
This one at least has custom score and actors who talk when their mouths move.
In fact, I have a suspicion this was originally written to be something in the style of a made for TV LMN film, but when it was decided to produce the film independently it was decided to capitalize on all potential for nude scenes, in order to appeal to a broader audience (id est, one that does not consist exclusively of alcoholic housewives.)
Diana, however, when she's not running naked through the wilderness (which is, actually quite often), is fairly adept at fighting back against Mr. Sadistic Big Game Hunter, who seems to be related to Jason, Freddy, & Michael Myers, since he takes a rock in the face, falls off a cliff, and gets run over by a car, only to keep on ticking...well, for a bit, anyway.
Arron Shiver is Dwight Terry, a newly hired deputy, fleeing from a past that haunts him, who suspects Colin when he discovers that Diana is the latest girl missing, and evidence builds against him.
The locked room HAS NO visible lights -- the old man uses a candle when he enters with his niece.
I mean, when you dash in out of a rain storm, well, you ought to be wet.
The fun comes in when you realize that certain characters obviously find it, they think, as clear cut as you do.
If the girl's coat had been wet when she came in out of the rain?
Things however become more complicated when another woman comes to the mansion claiming to be Doris Waverly (arriving with her vaudeville partner, the Great Lavelle- a magician).
Whyte and Dean send for the police in order to find out who the first woman was and who had her killed, and Doris (the second and real one) must be able to survive until midnight when she gets her inheritance.
Interestingly, I felt the same way when I saw Billy Wilder's version with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matheau.
Hildy is most alive when she's chasing the story and Russell looks a touch uncomfortable playing the 'little woman' moments.
Howard Hawks was completely on top of his game when he shot this film.
But when a prison break captures the imagination of a troupe of cutthroat reporters, all rabid for the scoop, Hildie sets aside marital bliss for one last hurrah behind the desk as a cub reporter.
Perfectly pairing Grant and Russell with an excellent script by Charles Lederer, based on Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's 1931 play, *The Front Page*, it is the kind of studio magic that could occur when the powers-that-be assigned the best work to the best candidates.
Have you ever heard anyone put so many words into a sentence without drawing a breath as when she finally for the umpteenth time tells Walter Burns (Grant) that she's out of the news business while tearing up her last interview?
Some of those witty lines (at least as legend has it) were improvised, such as when Grant describes Bruce Baldwin, saying that he "looks like that film actor, Ralph Bellamy."
Of course it helps when one of your two main characters has an ambiguous first name like Hildy.
Short for Hildreth when Pat O'Brien plays it, Rosalind Russell is all female in this one.
She proves it when she goes to work on that one last assignment to cover an execution at the state penitentiary.
Of course when Qualen escapes all kinds of complication arise and Russell's on the job to report them.
This all happens while Hildy interviews Earl Williams, a man due to be hung the next day... and then hides him in a roll-top desk in the courthouse press room when he escapes during a psychiatric evaluation.
The best moment of the film is the moment when Cary Grant speaking so fast, that some what he says goes over the viewer's heads, refers as to Ralph Bellamy by name as not having a chance and cites in the same breadth his real name Archibald Leach.
Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell were a brilliant screen pair (indeed, it seems that no one was bad casting when paired with Cary Grant) as rival reporters in a furiously paced news office.
The funniest moment in the film comes when she's chasing a man down the street (I won't go into details) and dive tackles him to the ground.
Charles McArthur and Ben Hecht met when both were reporters in Chicago during the 1920s.
But when the film was remade in 1940, Howard Hawks decided to redraw Hildy Johnson into a female reporter (and previous wife) of Burns.
This Walter Burns still wants to get his scoops, but there are moments of fragility when he realizes he may forever lose Hildy to her fiancÃ© Bruce (the ever helpless Ralph Bellamy).
The entire cast shines (look at the scene where Helen Mack confronts the reporters who have made her look like a tramp, and have told lies about John Qualen (Williams) - she is in a state when Russell takes her out of the press room, and the reporters are thoroughly ashamed of herself - and Russell comes back looking at Regis Toomey, Porter Hall, and the others, and says "Gentlemen of the Press!"
The other is when Burns says something about someone he once knew named "Archie Leach" which just happens to be Cary Grant's real name.
I'll stop there and mention that Robeson is in fine form musically especially when he sings "Deep River" that sends chills down the spine.
I've been waiting for the moment when I'd finally see the third installment of the Crow saga.
It's better done than the first one, because the first one had to be sown together a la Frankenstein when the lead actor really did die.
You can disagree with me and say the whole budget went to an illogically cool explosion and a trip to vegas for everyone, or ignore the crow's original bad acting--he's got a smirk on his face when he walks back in his cell, and take a trip downtown with the crow, way downtown.
One of my favorite scenes is when Mike enters the office that Dora Belair (portrayed by Angelique Pettyjohn, sadly her last film appearance) works from, and there's a poster on the wall behind them of her Star Trek character "Shana" dressed in that aluminum foil bikini from the episode "The Gamesters Of Treskelian".
The story and the actors are so boring and useless that I had to laugh when I saw this crap.
And when you have a good actress like Kirsten Dunst reduced to a whiny female lead, it only makes it worse.
I love "The Crow" when I watched "The Crow: Salvation" I fell in love with it.
((Girl screams when Alex's head hits widow.))
I hate it when people try to look like Alex or Ashe or Eric or Jimmy(any of the Crow's) They stink at looking like them.
when I saw this film, I really thought this film was made by the Sci-Fi channel.
he is then brought back from the dead by a crow when the legend says 'Love is stronger than death'.
I saw this first years ago, when I was kid, around the time it came out.
From about 10 seconds in, I remembered this movie competely, and was filled with merriment in the way people get when you see something again that you loved as a kid, and is still as good.
This guy simply owns the screen when the camera's pointed at him.
The way he talks is delicious, ****SPOILER**** and he has tons of heart and rage when he addresses his friends (Dunst when she claimed she wanted to die) and adversaries (every villain he toyed with before killing them) and strangers (the drug-using stripper at the club whose age he asked before freeing her).
Her best scene was when she had informed Mabius that it was her information that had led the bad cops to his figurative door before his arrest/execution.
And while I've seen Dale Midkiff and Bruce McCarthy in other films and I know them to be decent actors, they just don't have anything to do here besides being typical 1-dimentional villains (ie, needlessly violent, remorseless, having no positive aspects at all to them and good only when dead).
Plus, this film doesn't make out the perversion as beautiful, but with a disdain towards those young ones exploited{example being when Alex confronts the young girl tied to a pole in the strip club owned by the dirty cops}.
Alex gets more than he bargained for, however, when his actions causes Erin to be in fatal danger.
Plus, it's always good to see police officers get theirs when death is knocking on the door.
Yes, life fights against you, but it will win when you give up!
The actual nice things in the movie are small details like the secret eating of the walnut by the elder sister,like the scene of epilepsy attack of Deli Omer...- In the beginning of the movie,there was a scene o a cat moving around a man crying which is shot totally incidentally,is making you feel good ,happy but not...and immediately after the dead man comes alive and you feel peculiar... During all the time,during all that childish love stories you actually expect the explanation of that coming back to life scene and it is explained actually in the end when Recep promises Deli Omer to bring alive his dead wife.
The excitement of watching and listening to those legends is still with me and I especially remember the amazement that registered on Chubby Checker's face when he saw the enthusiastic response he was getting from the crowd so many years after his hit version of Hank Ballard's Twist.
I wasn't born until 1962, but when I was a young tyke, I had to see this movie from the moment I saw the TV spot advertising it on television.
I also saw this movie when I was young on TV in Los Angeles.
I saw it over and over again when I was around 9-11 (over 40 yrs ago), and would be interested to see how it has aged.
In a world full of imported 2 year old spoon fed animation, it's kind of nice to go back and see what cartoons where like when people were kind of just experimenting.
In the technical sense this is "limited" animation - the handful of animators (just four are credited) charged with bringing the story to life restrict themselves, when they can, to less than the full 24 frames per second, and often use all manner of cunning tricks to avoid having to animate at all.
If your experience of "limited" animation is "South Park", you can be forgiven for thinking that "limited" is just a polite synonym for "bad", since "South Park" looks crude and awkward and just plain awful even when compressed to fit the tiniest of TV screens.
The Applegate mansion is a spooky looking house and when the boys finally meet the owner he confirms that there really is a treasure, given to his grandfather by LaFitte the pirate as repayment for when he burned the Applegate plantation.
The series had immense potential to create a suspenseful masterpiece, but instead it's like watching a filler arc when something finally happens after 6 episodes.
Oh but don't get me wrong, eventually something does happen, but when it FINALLY does it provides maybe a few minutes of fright but that's it.
(see: http://tinyurl.com/2w5tll) and when it finally does get to the horrifying climax it can give you a few chills, before it abruptly cuts off.
Apparently when cicadas cry, this horror dies.
It all starts when a young boy Keichii moves to the little village from the city in the month of June 1983.
A sudden turn of events pop off when Flea's (cam) niece gets popped (shot).
Also,It's embarrassing when Cam'ron tries to show off his dramatic skills and even more embarrassing when he talks.
It is fun to watch your favorite rappers in film, even when its not a good film.
There is one handicam scene however, which stood out for being shaky for no necessary reason (when Anna walks through the park to meet Sean).
Breaking again into a young woman's apartment in order to satisfy his now out of control and inflamed libido Tony ends up getting caught when she escapes from his clutches.
Unfortunately Tony didn't seek help and it was after he crossed that point of no return when he went from watching to murdering the women that turned him on that there was no help that society, other then long stretch behind bars or a cops bullet in his chest, could offer him.
But when you throw in violence and necrophilia it gets pretty sick.
But, how can you forgive and move on, when no-one will admit wrong-doing?
Terry (Charles Martin Smith) is taking care of Steve's car when Steve goes away to college, and he picks up a good lookin' chick, which results in many comedic situations.
John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is a drag racer trying to pick up chicks, but he gets more than he bargained for when he ends up with the 13 year old sister (played by a young Mackenzie Phillips) of a female acquaintance of his.
If he really was sean and really did love her, he would stop trying to impose himself into her life when he knew it could never work.
I understand that it is PROBABLE that when he asked Clara in the bathroom not to tell Anna he was referring to the letters he dug up.
George Lucas's second feature film is definitely an A-plus when it comes to life in the early 1960s.
It's nice to check this movie out again when you have the chance.
American Graffiti is aBurroughsesque cut up segment movie about what George 'Me's a so sorry' Lucas got up to when he was a teen in the 1920s.
The adults are mere secondary characters; exactly how it seems when were growing up.
Sort of like when your 6 month old child calls your cat a dog, kind of funny if you're there, but if you saw it in a movie you wouldn't exactly be slapping your knee.
I'm a little younger than Mr. Lucas but I find myself taken back to high school when I see this.
Or is it that I was so much closer to the ages of the characters when I saw it the first time.
I have to say that when Lucas was young, he had balls.
Ultimately, the story is about going away and remembering the good times that everyone has when they're young.
My favourite moment of the film is when Dreyfuss's character sees an attractive, young blond early on - he later tries frantically to contact her - she eventually does, but just says her dues and leaves him - the boy, instead of being heartbroken or dissatisfied is happy and upbeat - at least he gave it a chance, at least he lived, as my father put it 'the teenage dream'.
It is also a trip back to the last days of childhood, when everything was cool and easy, but we reluctantly started to realise that it would not stay like that forever.
In fact, when you look back, I think we owe a debt of gratitude to George Lucas and the gang for giving us "American Graffiti".
The eventful night when freshly graduated high school friends contemplated their futures while immersed in small town America's car-hops, drive-in movies & doo-wop music (the soundtrack is one of the best featured in ANY film!
Wolfman Jack plays himself (and cupid) when he plays a very special request going out from Richard Dreyfuss to his dream girl Suzanne Sommers.
I remember watching this movie on May 31, 2002, the night before my high school graduation and when I watch this film, it reminded me of the things that happened with me throughout my senior year: from a guy I knew, who cheated on his girlfriend with a cheerleader, to the terrorist attack that tore America apart; causing Americans to go against one another, from the crushes, the heartbreaks, prom night, to Spider-Man being the movie of the year, graduation rehearsal, and technology becoming the new aspect in my life and when I watched American Graffiti, it reminded me of when the good times meant something with those around me.
He wants to break up so they can see other people; but later when they are named King and Queen at the homecoming dance, they are together again where he tries to have sex with her.
American Graffiti in my opinion is a retrospect of the good times that people had when everything was innocent, in an era where crusin' was important, especially rock n' roll.
The events that befall the characters in the movie will no doubt touch a nerve with anyone that has gone through childhood - things such as splitting up with your girlfriend, to being forced into doing things that could get you into trouble...all the way to asking an adult to go into a store to buy alcohol for you are shown with great care, and show that Lucas obviously knew what he was doing when he took on this movie.
Unlike the typical example from the short-lived but oddly prolific Nazisploitation subgenre, THE RED NIGHTS OF THE GESTAPO does not deal with the dehumanizing activities in Nazi concentration camps but rather with all the salacious perversions that a group of renegade anti-Nazi Germans get down to when they are holed up in a castle one night under the supposed pretext of plotting Hitler's downfall.
I like some of its ideas about how Nicole Kidman's character was shown through her actions, as well as some of the times when (she was watching a movie with her fiancÃ©)her mood changes slowly as she is trying to get over a shock by pretending to be watching the movie.
The way they wasted so much time was ridiculous (this includes the very beginning part of the movie when a man wearing black is running).
From the get go, when Rainer (Moritz Bleibtreu) drives through the streets, drinking Vodka, toting a gun and a baseball bat, listening to "aggressive" music (Downset's "Anger"... Jesus Christ, you seriously live in the past, Weingartner), you can't help but wonder: Is this meant seriously?
Incredibly stupid game shows, which try to force people to call and to give money for nothing, like for example: "Yes now you can win even more, tell me when do you have birthday!...
There is something when it comes to film and German, during their film history they have give us several of the best films ever made, but the latest decay film in German has only been about Tom Tykwer.
When oh when will this miniseries become available on video or DVD?
Having been a late comer to 'The Wire' series on the FX channel in Britain then when that finished they advertised 'The Corner'.
Usually, when people think of the drug problem in America they first think of the big cities.
This is a real curiosity from the vaults, a late 60s Swedish sex education film which became an enormous box office hit across Europe and even, when it was finally released uncut with an X certificate, in the UK in 1973 (it was initially refused a certificate); this is historically interesting, as The Language of Love (as it was titled in English speaking markets) features some sections of actual hardcore footage, with close ups of fingers masturbating vaginas and a penis penetrating one.
The most striking moment comes when the most focused-upon couple, who've previously experienced sexual problems, talk to each other after a bout of now satisfying sex and tell each other that they are now "real" - two less "real" people you'll have trouble finding in the history of the cinema.
So I'm relaxing (sobering up) on a fine Sunday morning when what do I see on UPN (latterly CW)?
My new open mind concerning Shyamalan was soon re-shut when I read about his dissatisfaction with the movie and his lack of total freedom with the project.
I eventually went to see it again when it was finally released to the general public.
I saw "Sixth Sense" and "Lady in the Water" close to when they came out.
I'm sure there's more I missed, and will view again when I am more Wide Awake.
Second, Dennis Leary isn't funny when he keeps his comedy clean.
I had only heard of Mr. Shyamalan's "Praying With Anger," when I saw this movie, nor did I realize that he was also the director of "The Sixth Sense," which was in theaters when I saw this on pay-TV.
And when I sprang this movie on my family for Christmas, with no introduction, and no other information other than, "You're going to like this movie," words which no doubt only made the prospect of watching this film only slightly more desirable than being boiled in plum pudding, they balked, objected, and complained for about two minutes.
Why didn't Sean remember who the old lady was and why didn't he remember his "lover" when he met her.
Anne Hesh's character wasn't present when the recordings of the kid and what he said were played.
Kidman was right on the money when her character explained to her fiancÃ© that it wasn't her fault when referring to how everything happened.
The movie for me shows the anguish and torture love can cause and how it never disappears even when you "belong" to someone else.
The feeling you get when you watch the movie is warmth, heartening which will last for some time.
It is more than a movie to me.I could really relate to Joshua as i also used to think a lot about God at that age partly because i was born in a very religious family.The feelings Joshua goes through in his search for god and how it changes him to a certain extent for eg, when Freddie Waltman-a boy who has bullied Joshua since 3rd grade has to leave school...instead of feeling happy he feels really sad for him... have been narrated on screen beyond words...only a genius could have achieved this.
after viewing just the trailer, my sister and i looked at each other and said, "we have to see that..." so, when i found it at blockbuster a few months later, i jumped to rent it.
I came upon this movie purely by accident when it was being shown on cable, and found myself riveted to my seat, not wanting to miss a minute of it.
There aren't many misses when it comes to the jokes(not as much as I can say for Van Wilder, American Pie 2 or Scary Movie 2).
One of the funniest parts in the movie for me is when Ryan Reynolds announces at a wedding that he is a raging homosexual, and also when he thinks he has slept with a man, plus it's good natured as well.
I couldn't make it past the homophobic terror scene when the guy thinks he got drunk and slept with a guy -folowing by a pedophilia joke.
THe movie flows very well especially when Ryan thinks he is gay!lol and the flashbacks at the airport.
The movie characters all play significant roles that tie into the theme- "Why would you want to Buy the Cow when you can get the milk for free?"
I had to cringe (in a good way) when he almost gets shot as a would-be pedophile.
OK everyone else has given a good synopsis of this movie and you should realise you're not getting Citizen Kane here but a solid piece of propaganda produced on the cheap and quickly when such things mattered in Britain, ie a horde of Nazi stormtroopers were waiting to invade thirty miles across the Channel and the British people better be ready to deal with it when the time comes.
The acting is at times stiff and the dialogue can be a bit facile at times but when the acting and dialogue are good they are excellent.
There are some very significant and subtle moments; the first active resister is the Christian minister, the British serviceman rallies the village defence is a sailor, the dreadful night ends and daylight breaks through just at the point when the villagers learn the outside world is on the way to help, the villagers are prepared to wreck their own beautiful and historic mansion house without a moment's hesitation in the fight to beat the Germans.
when the shooting starts, "Not again" when the sailor shouts the same and surely I can't be the only one to pick up on the servant Bridget?
These are relatively minor problems though when compared with the rest of the film.
While at times an obvious piece of World War II propaganda as a thriller it stands up quite well nearly seven decades on from when it was made.
The acting was fine Â and the only think that I didn't like was the scene at the theater, when for like 30 seconds or more I was watching the face of Nicole Kidman Â I got what the director was trying to emphasize in that scene , but 10 seconds or so would have been just enough.
This is definitely an item to motivate the ladies, and must have had a powerful effect when it was shown at the height of WW2.
There are some nice lighting effects too; I particularly liked the 'morning mist' events, when the citizens of Bramley End begin to turn the tables.
We are not spared the horrors of war, I think particularly of the scene when the telephone operator having summoned the courage to kill her German captor is killed trying to contact someone for help, you don't see anything but because of that it is all the more powerful.
However, things get complicated when the real daughter reappears.
It was hilarious when they shoved her against the door.
I tried to watch this and actually lost interest, except of course when "Leatherface" was sawing off the face of a hapless victim, in the fashion of Ed Gein.
And that, is the sick pleasure one gets when watching the movie.
To watch this uncut, uncensored in R21 glory, and anticipating those moments when Leatherface discovers the joy and pleasure of using the chainsaw, makes this movie the largest guilt trip I have undertaken this week.
The main theme, a horn melody intoned over a rhythmic underworking of fast-moving violins, really drives the film's excitement when it's not creating haunting tonalities during the suspenseful moments.
Jablonsky's reprisal of Leatherface's theme is especially moving when he puts on the face of one of his victims, wearing the human mask (the "leather face") for the first time Â the score crescendos in a slow ascent of triumph, yet tinged with the horror relevant in that triumph.
Yes, this was a horror movie that did what a horror movie is supposed to do when it comes to the slasher genre.
It seemed at times when I was watching this movie that all the characters could say was "PLEASE", "NO!!!!
In July, 1969, when the facility is closed, the inhabitants move to other places, but the deformed insane Thomas kills the foreman.
All is "well" until the day when the place is shut down by the Texas Board of Health for obvious & serious health code violations.
In fact, I dare say when I was leaving the theater, the only crime I felt had taken place was fraud!
For instance, Leatherface is one bad mutha...he's huge, he's powerful (lifts one guy up off the ground, impaled on a chainsaw), and he causes the ground to shake when he walks.
I'm far from a prude when it comes to cinematic violence, and it takes a lot to offend my otherwise salivating horror sensibilityÂ But "The Beginning" is absolutely wretchedÂa rock-bottom low in horrorÂand film in general.
It's a nihilistic, grueling, and utterly unredeemable excuse for inflicting pain under the banner of "horror," when it is really anything but.
It is a throw-back, just as the remake was to a time when the horror movie market was not dominated with slews of PG-13 watered down,"psychological horror" ripped off from real Japanese horror movies and only made worse by US film makers.
I've been a Texas chainsaw fanatic since i saw the original (when i was about 8) and all the sequels obviously tried hard (except the one with Bridget Jones in which was an utter waste of time) but ultimately failed to be worthy of following up such a classic.
but when i had finished watching this one (a prequel to a remake?)
Anna, the woman who suffered the great loss in her life fights the boy when he appears, then, as everything points into the right direction, or what she wants to believe, and she gets answers that have been inside her head all the time, she accepts as natural a situation that by all accounts if far from normal.
There are moments when we, as the viewer, feel the pain Anna is feeling.
Her sequence at the concert when we watch her face, as all the emotions are seen in her face, is one of her best moments in a film.
Also the last sequence when we watch her at the beach, after she has married Joseph and is seen wandering in the water crying is another clue we get from her.
Brewster, Handley, Baird and Bomer are all good-looking and likable--when the violence starts you really are horrified at seeing such great characters being tortured.
His character is so twisted, violent and sick that when he got a taste of his own medicine my quiet audience broke out in applause.
Everything that comes to mind when you hear the words "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is in this movie.
The characters, especially the adorable Merbabies, were completely likable and there are some truly entertaining bits, like the part when the seahorse tries to get through the hoop.
I will admit, Merbabies is thin in terms of story, and I was saddened when the Merbabies turned to sea foam at the end.
Finally, just when the atmosphere couldn't be any cheerier, everyone scatters at the approach of a hard breathing whale (as in PINOCCHIO).
Pacino played his role very well; his performance harkened back to his prime in the 1970s when he could be absolutely riveting on screen.
His sort of light easy attitude (even when he was very serious) played very well against Pacino's dark and brooding persona.  
She's the one carrying the movie, and takes part in so many outstanding scenes - the lingering shot at the concert hall, trying to explain the situation to Clifford (the best man at her marriage to Sean) during which her declining mental state starts to reveal itself, the scene in the bathroom when she reveals her insane plan to run away with the boy only to find that he's a liar, the boardroom scene in which she tries to tell Joseph that none of it was her fault (probably my favourite scene), the heartrending scene at the beach.
The movie does a nice job of contrasting Pacino as an insightful, sensitive, and articulate dude when sober, against someone who inevitably says and does really stupid things when he's blotto.
They both feature Ellen Barkin at a time in her career when sizzling sex scenes seemed to be written into her contract.
They decide to work together when they find that prints match from both of their cases and both males had put poems in the singles-ads.
But, Frank begins questioning their relationship when he begins noticing little signs that may point to Helen possibly being the very killer he's investigating.
I went to this movie when it came out simply because it had Al Pacino in it, and half-expected some sort of cheesy love story.
He is so shocked when he discovers she is connected with the victims that he stops thinking and he wants her to commit one more crime and he frightens her to death and she leaves.
That's rare, my gosh, that's rare but so good when you meet one from time to time.
Keller finds a clue when he notices that both of the murder victims had placed ads in a local paper's personal section looking for romance and action with the opposite sex.
Things start to get complicated when Keller meets beautiful shoe-store worker Helen (Ellen Barkin).
Detective Sherman, from a district outside Manhattan, joins Frank when a second victim is killed in the same MO.
It's one thing to be gorgeous at 22, when most women are at their most alluring, but for a beautiful woman to age so gracefully is rare.
Within a kind of light and shadow there's almost a trademark photography for a film noir movie, and "Sea of Love" is a film that takes place in the shadowsÂ   Al Pacino plays Frank Teller, a self-conscious detectiveÂin search of a serial killerÂdrawn into a torrid sexual relationship with an attractive young woman he met in a super market when all the good citizens of the city are asleep and the people who are walking around are the ones who are leading the most solitary livesÂ   Helen Barkin is just so right for the partÂ You can believe her when you see her dressed in her red leather jacket and tight jeansÂ She's a lady of the night, sexy as hell, and a woman who can take care of herselfÂ Between her and Pacino, there were enough attraction that's deep but also there were feelings of vulnerability and suspicionÂ
Sea of Love is just one of those movies that kept me in great suspense and excitement I really felt surprised in the end when the killer was revealed.
Then the search takes a good but yet a bad turn when Pacino (Detective Frank Keller) finds an interesting friend a very sexy and erotic type looking female played marvelously by the attractive Ellen Barkin.
We find out in the first few minutes that its the name of the song the killer was playing when the first murder of the film occured.
I can point out several moments when the film took unnecessary turns or took unnecessary liberties with character development,but the honesty that comes from the written word along with the honesty in which the actors portrayed their characters made me absolutely love this movie.
Well, this recipe gets even more out of hand when a bum who was already incarcerated and inhabiting the cell claims to be GodÂÂÂ.
John Ford Noonan, the most degenerate looking guy on the planet, totally steals the show when he breaks the news to everyone that he is God.
Noonan hasn't had a big career as an actor which is a shame; because when you see him in this you will be thoroughly impressed.
Of course fancy to meet you here!when things begin to heat up God tries to lend some advice and kind heartfelt solutions to their problems, which are obviously laughed off right away.
Actor John Ford Noonan who played a sort of "God" mouthpiece,should of been singled out by Indie crowd as one of the best performances in years,but to my surprise,many people still have not heard of this film,and when I called the IFC channel to complain (I read one of the viewer's rants on the IFC's refusel to play it) They gave me no reasonable excuse,just a simple "We passed on that title".
Not to mention that Renata is kind of a slut because she has a boyfriend when she starts going out with Ulises.
The duality was shown towards the end specifically when they were both shown taking portraits.
this movie showed true feeling when she started to look at him she did not take him seriously he thought that she was a young beautiful girl he would draw pictures of her and spray paint he name on walls to show her how much he loved her near the end it got very intament she showed her love to him a lot and was very comfortable
Cameron Bright is a real talent and is even more impressive when you realize how little dialogue he actually has.
I did feel that Colbert was convinced at the end by Welles that he was not her husband John, my only doubt being the denouement when her possession of his daughter, Natalie Wood, and her exit, is so perfunctory.
The most memorable scene from the movie is when Shambhu pushes himself to his limits pulling a hand pulled rikshaw.
But God knows how you're going to do that when you can't find the movie ANYWHERE!!
  I saw this movie on late night local tv when i was about 12.
If you have seen it, please note this clarifying explanation: Strange that critics, especially critics of the end of "Birth" forget that one important line: when little Sean says to Clara in the bathroom "don't tell Anna."
(Most Maroccan girls in the Netherlands are living a double life: timid and traditional at home, sexy and modern when they are outside their parents radar-range)  * End spoilers *  In many respects this movie is a first.
At times you hear parts of the audience laugh or cheer when other parts don't get it.
It gave a lot of noise when this film was released in Holland.
It was only time when what we do use on a daily basis -- phones, faxes, printers, television, and of course the World Wide Web -- would be the harbinger that could thin the layers separating us from those who are in another dimension and create an escalating panic.
When she arrives at his apartment, he seems fine to her, but when she goes searching for a particular disk she needs, he hangs himself.
One in particular is gruesome even when seen from a distance as Michi is on the phone: a woman throwing herself off a high tower, her body hitting the floor in a flat thud.
The most effective scene in the film was the moment when Anna's sister-in-law Clara (Anne Heche) confronts the child with her own secrets pertaining to Anna and Sean.
What happens when that space fills?
Good luck figuring out the connections, or when a character is a ghost yet or just acting strangely.
It's far too long and ends just when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is nonsensical.
Weakest moment: when "the boss" sits down to give some incoherent advice.
Granted, the plot is slightly unpalatable, and yes, there are instances when the film appears to veer into senslessness, but, unless you want a clear-cut resolution, this cannot quite be written off as shoddy work on the part of anyone involved.
What the screenplay does, quite beautifully, is convey silent emotions; it understands, better than most films, that communication is often non-verbal, and in this situation, when the very thing at stake is reason, it is logical that the characters would be at a loss for words.
Kairo, or Pulse as it's known amongst English speaking audiences, is set in Tokyo & starts as Sunny Plant Sales employee Michi Kudo (Kumiko Aso) decides to visit her friend Taguchi (Kenji Mizuhashi) to enquire about a computer disk he's been working on, when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her.
Meanwhile a student named Ryosuke Kawashima (Haruhiko Kato) has recently hooked up to the internet & keeps getting spooky messages & images on his monitor so he ask's computer whizz Harue Karasawa (Koyuki) whats happening, she doesn't really know but it seems that the place where people's spirits go when they die is full & they need somewhere else to go & Earth is as good a place as any, right?
The film looks so dull & boring it's untrue, the camera just sits there for very long shots & when it does move it moves very slowly, this has all the style of a Mexican soap opera.
Since Kairo is sub titled it's difficult to judge the original performances so I won't bother, it's hard to care for someone when they don't even speak the same language & you don't know what they are saying.
Seems that wherever spirits go when they're dead is full, and the spirits remain on earth, lingering in the shadows and around corners, always just out of sight.
I'm a jaded horror-movie fan, hence approximately once in a blue moon do I get to watch a film from this genre that has me glued to the screen rather than bored or sneering/almost laughing at the gore when I'm not supposed to.
I have to admit that when I first saw this film I did not expect it to be what it is.
The basic premise involves a haunted website, so when I sat down to view it I was expecting something at the same level of terrible as fear.com; instead, I was shocked to find a truly provocative story full of surrealism and drama that examines the concept of isolation and the deep fear that all people have of loneliness.
I see horror films from all over the world so I am pretty jaded when it comes to something "scaring" me but this film has many sequences that truly are frightening and disturbing.
There are moments when people are confronted by visions/images of ghosts that move and terrorize just like real dreams - slow movements, awkward movements as the ghost approaches you.
Operating well with a sense that I can only describe as dream logic this concerns the really weird events surrounding several people who notice something is wrong when a friend goes missing.
So when I say that this is the creepiest horror movie ever made, it is not hyperbole.
The humor is added when Dean is impressed and says don't drop the soap.
All in all a FANTASTIC piece of work, and one of my favourite episodes... and while I'm here can i just add how much i loved that blood splatter on the camera when SAM blew up :D Xsarahx
Dean says that they should lay low, especially when they learn that someone at the Roadhouse tipped off Gordon.
But, Dean leaves the house when Sam asks him to, because he trust his brother's judgment.
"I just remembered that when I was a kid, I ate like 6 things of Pop-Rocks and then drank a whole can of soda!
One such man, Gideon Marunga (Richard Roundtree), is nearly killed when a routine ambush goes wrong and results in several deaths and casualties on both sides.
The public obsession first began proper when the Cannon Film Group released the Sho Kosugi outing, Enter the Ninja in 1984.
I remembered that show from when I was a small kid.
I remembered key scenes like when The Master plays dead on the hotel room floor and I remembered Max's van.
I thought the camera work was good and the different techniques often added to the intensity of the situation when required.
He gets bullied and that's when he starts to go nuts.
You feel no sense of danger when the battles are ranging, you don't feel camradare for the soldiers fighting cause the actors are lame, you don't feel sadness when the soldiers die.
The guys loved it, and one scene when they give chocolate bars to the soldiers, stuck to one's mind and one's appetite.
I quite loved this film when I first saw it as a 22 year old at the Fox theater in Fullerton, Calif.
The commanding officer of the outfit is somewhat surprised when Murphy puts in a request to transfer to the paratroopers.
His superior officers wanted to ship Murphy off to West Point, but those ambitious plans were sidetracked when Murphy suffered a war wound that disqualified him for the academy.
What you'll realize about Murphy's performance is how real it is, because it's a rare moment in movies when someone plays themselves in an actual moment that changed their lives.
Working two jobs at this age, he still wrote cursively w/ excellent spelling and diction when he had to quit his education.
In a current world of 50 cents, we can look back to a time when a man was truly a man, and that man was the United States Medal of Honor Winner: AUDIE MURPHY.
He never really seemed to care about the medals or glory, just the men of his unit and friends who fall down in the European Theater of Operations...   Murphy died tragically on May 28, 1971, when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into a mountain near Roanoke, Virginia...
But when Final Fantasy VII hit the PlayStation, I was addicted.
But a few years later, when Final Fantasy VIII came to American shores and I piked it up, I was blown away.
Tomorrow Is Forever finds Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert as a pair of young marrieds during World War I when Orson announces he's enlisted in the American Expeditionary Force.
The way to play is here: you choose the weapons, the equipments and the men, you can made a plan, and you got to accomplish mission, such as defuse bombs, rescue and escort hostages... you CAN KILL TERRORISTS, OF COURSE, BUT THEY ALSO CAN KILL YOU, OR YOUR TEAM MEMBERS, OR THE HOSTAGES, so you must TOOK CARE... when the character that you're using dies, you get the control of another team member since they're all gone (you loose) or the mission is accomplished (you win), but you also loose if hostages are killed, or the bomb explodes, it depends from the mission.
i remember when i first played this game years ago.
so when shots are fired you never know whats going to happen.
The look into Che is also a contrast to American assumptions (especially today when everyone is clamoring about how we're becoming a communist state)
Only when I got to the last few pages did I find people who agree with me that this film is drivel.
Both early and final release versions still have no opening credits so the audience has no idea whom/what to expect--making it such a triumph when we recognize the never (EVER) credited Matt Damon as a young priest shot mid-distance; and Soderbergh's nom-de-plume photographer credit of "Peter Andrews".
There's some obvious contextual information that we can divulge on when discussing the film Che.
In this first part of his "Che", he combines all the forms and styles he has tried when shooting and the result is undoubtedly his most ambitious project, but is it his best?
Even when his moves and postures express the work of someone who has intensely studied a historical figure and traveled for his purpose and God knows what else, his collaboration with Soderbergh is also crucial.
The answers he gives throughout the film and define the structure of it, for example, are clearly recorded in post-production; and even when they help the viewer understand, they loose naturalness.
Edition must have helped his work a lot; a work that wins in those moments when his Che is quiet, peaceful.
There we understand him better and believe him, but then there are moments when he irradiates pure rage and is so natural and convincing that we wonder where he had kept those emotions the whole time.
The events in Cuba are shown alongside the later events when Che travelled to New York to address the UN, and through this we see Che beginning to emerge both as a tough jungle/street fighter and political orator with intelligence and feeling, finally transforming himself from a doctor with political leanings to a fully fledged revolutionary.
Personally I can not wait for mid March when I will have the chance to see part two!
Filmed in Puerto Rico and other amazing locations, Benicio's Che is a man with a mission from beginning to end when he is shot in Bolivia.
The editing could be improved if indeed this will be shown in two parts when as a whole, it is amazing.
I don't really know when will be released in my city Che Part Two (Guerrilla), I hope it will in theaters next Friday and if so I will, certainly, be there.
A fine example is when two brothers of only 16 and 14 wanted to join the revolutionaries, they were with some other people that certainly also wanted to fight and the brothers were the only ones who knew how to read and write, they will stay and we will see how when all of the revolutionaries had the last chance to stop fighting they will not leave Che and they will have the option to leave the fight but certainly with their honor intact.
"There is no amount of accumulated barbarity that would have satisfied the people who hate him," says the director when confronted with this.
When we analyse the real person (which most people don't), we could perhaps ask if noble ideals are as noble when they don't always have noble results.
What on earth was director Steven Soderbergh thinking when he decided to tackle the story of Ernesto 'Che' Guevara, the Argentinian born doctor and revolutionary who joined Fidel Castro's campaign to take Cuba back from the American backed dictator, Fulgencio Batista?
He inhabits the role of Guevara so well, that there are times when I wasn't sure if the historical footage Â recreated in black and white Â didn't have the real Che Guevara in them.
An example is when Che all of a sudden needs a cast for his arm.
We don't know what happened, another character actually asks him, but when the answer is about to be said, we cut to another scene.
Sometimes you almost feel like you're watching a documentary that's trying to teach rather than entertain and this can start to wear, especially when you're reading subtitles.
Of course, when I use the word documentary, I don't mean it literally, but rather, as a means to say that the approach its director takes it similar to those used by directors of documentaries.
In retrospect, the similarity between "The Mercenary" and "Duck, You Sucker" shouldn't seem too surprisingly when you consider that the same scenarist, Luciano VincenzoniÂwho penned "Death Rides A Horse," "For A Few Dollars More," and "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"Âwrote both "The Mercenary" and "Duck, You Sucker."
Nevertheless, he was his equal when it came to staging gunfights and helming snappy action stories.
However, Corbucci shows uncharacteristic flair when he stages a killing and a torture scene and declines to show the violence in each scene.
However the story is well constructed, and the dialogue isn't too bad when compared to Corbucci's previous efforts and the majority of spaghettis made at this time.
Even so just when you think its finished and the climax feels like it came too early, there's even more to come afterwards.
I was totally knocked out of my socks when I saw that this masterpiece was on TV.
Write down all those alternative titles so you don't miss it when it's on TV.
Aside from nice bits of humor, it sports some religious allusions, such as, Paco begins with only twelve men + Nero (their Jesus), they masquerade at one point during a religious parade and attack while dressed as angels and virgin Mary's, as well as Nero being strapped to a t-shaped cross when captured.
There is also a nod to Macbeth when Paco's woman uses his power drunk naivetÃ© to convince him to turn against Nero.
But sadly I was once again disappointed, as I have been many times before when that line has been used to describe a horror/gore/splatter film.
Apparently she begins researching that type of stuff too, and when she gets too close, certain people aren't happy with her prying and decide to take action against her...
As far as I know, they hold the rights here in the U.S. but have no ETA as to when it will be released.
The joy of the family when Joey walks again is so real and convincing.
The look she gives oone couple who bump into them when they dance is funny.
The ending is the one of the best parts of the game and quite long and you feel sorry for Squall when you see him cry and Rinoa cries when she sees him.
Hyped as The First French Sex-Horror Film "The Blood Rose" certainly delivers the goods.Lemaire plays an aging painter whose wedded bliss to gorgeous Anne turns to tragedy,when she nearly gets in a catfight with his former lover and falls into a fire in a pretty hilarious scene.She is of course horribly scarred.The great Howard Vernon plays a surgeon who may be able to return her to her former beauty,but he'll need a live victim to do it.So women are brought to the artist's chÃ¢teau in order to get a face.The dwarfs,who were the painter's longtime servants,are charged with capturing the girls.Clearly inspired by Franju "Eyes Without the Face" "The Blood Rose" features lovely Gothic setting of French medieval castle, great-looking women and a healthy dose of sleaze.Rollin-esquire atmosphere is well-captured and the climax is fantastic.7 out of 10.
It is only when one can feel the awe at how the fate of the Soong sister was intertwined with the fate of modern China, that one can really appreciate the movie.
Keep the truth in mind (for example, Chiang did not capitulate at Xian when he was kidnapped) and enjoy this wonderful film.
The look she gives one couple who bump into them when they dance is funny.
The ending is the one of the best parts of the game and quite long and you feel sorry for Squall when you see him cry and Rinoa cries when she sees him.
The role of the second sister was well played by Maggie Cheung as she showed her love for her country, her wit (when she said that both she and the plane were made in China, so why could they not trust made in China goods) and her loyalty to the memory of Sun (when she stepped down from the party, feeling that its true principles had been betrayed.
The move sizzles with electricity when these three beauties appear on screen together, as they do in several scenes.
I first saw it when it was released in 1976 and, at the time, I played little league (well, the Canadian equivalent).
Their fortunes change somewhat when Matthau convinces the daughter of an old girlfriend (Tatum O'Neal, just coming off a shocking Oscar win for "Paper Moon") to pitch for the team.
The Bears go from losers to winners when the local juvenile delinquent, Kelly Leak, joins the team.
After seeing this film, you'll immediately think of the Bears when you hear the "March of the Torreodors".
I liked this movie when I was growing up and you know what?
What made this movie so groundbreaking when I first saw it in the summer of 1976 was that kids were portrayed as they really were instead of as the innocent, sometimes mischievous cherubs that most movies presented.
Also, I half expected her to walk away from him when he threw his beer at her during a game or practice.
What's amazing was that after the game's release was a sudden fad when people went crazy over the Rinoa angel wings, Squall's Lion symbols, and the beautiful song: Eyes on Me.
As a comedy, a good chunk of that nastiness earns a good deal of laughs, especially when it involves the innocence of kids rather than the awfulness of the adults.
But things start to pick up when Morris enlists his talented daughter Manda {Tatum O'Neal) to pitch for them.
Well, the coach and kids soon learn that sports is not that fun when you are the laughingstock of a very competitive league.
I think the reason it works is that it doesn't pull any punches when it come to showing children in different lights.
My whole point was to illustrate how movies of today have lost there edge when it comes to dealing with delegate subjects, exspecally when kids are involved.
For many of us growing up 30 years ago when "The Bad News Bears" first came out, this is the film that peeled back the suburban sheen of middle-class American life and used that anchor of conformity, Little League Baseball, to lay it all bare: the false values, the fear of mediocrity, coming to grips with the hard truths of life.
There's a shrimp named Tanner Boyle with plenty of fight but no coordination, a fat kid named Engelberg who smears chocolate on the ball when throwing it back to the pitcher, a pair of Mexicans no one understands, a bookworm who keeps track of foul balls but can't hit for beans, and Timmy Lupus, a painfully shy small fry who Boyle calls a "booger-eating spaz."
I don't know how many times later in life when meeting someone and they heard my last name, they would ask "Did your dad coach little league?
It was hard seeing him playing a villain character when I always thought of him as the heroic Sgt.
I left the game feeling pretty disgusted, and for a brief moment I asked myself where was Roy Turner when you need him.
I played Little League way back when, and this movie is pretty true to my experience.
Subsequently the Councilman even drops supporting the team when it loses it's first game by a score of 26 to 0.
And initially the opportunist in Butterworth makes his work as manager become second-rate (he rarely trains them when sober, and he even has them assist him in his job as a swimming pool cleaner).
Let us just say Turner is not facing a happy future when the film ends.
I enjoyed watching The Bad News Bears.At first though I didn't want anything to do with it.Seeing as how I'm not really into sports movies, I didn't feel like watching this at all, but I was forced by my friend, who has good taste, and he loved it, so I decided to give it at least 1 viewing.Well, I have to say when the movie started up, I was already dreading it.It just seemed to me to be very boring and plain, and I just kept getting more and more aggravated as the movie continued on.Suddenly, it's like the whole thing changed around.I started getting a bit more entertained, and it sort of changed up from how other sports movies are.I still didn't get what I wanted from The Bad News Bears, but in all fairness this was a really good and original movie, that wasn't as bad as I was thinking it to be.I especially liked the outcome of this movie, for it was very cool, and if you give it a chance like I did, I'm sure you will too.
Anyway, this film was magical when I saw it as an 8 year old in 1976.
I love the final scene when the Bears lose and tell the Yankees to shove the 2nd place trophy you know where!
It always slipped my mind though when I wanted to rent it, but finally I remembered and I am so glad that I got the chance to see it, because this is one of the best comedies to come out of the 70's.
But he's definitely taken back when he finds out that the team he is coaching are kids who are, well, I guess you could say "lacking" in the department of knowing how to play baseball.
But he just wants to get paid and get the job over with, but when their first game comes along, the kids get creamed 26-0, Buttermaker is pressured to drop the team out of the league, but instead teaches the kids how to play and recruits a couple of new kids, a girl who's mother he used to date, and a rebel without a cause.
The kids get better in each game, but it's a matter of Buttermaker getting his priorities straight when he lets the game get the worst of him... and he's an alcoholic!
I remember first seeing it at a drive-in when I was ten, shortly after my own little league season had finished.
Lona Andre often played dizzy blondes but when she retired from films she became a successful real estate business woman.
Dona and her fiancÃ©, Phil, (Donald Reed) are on the spot when "Good Looking Freddie" is rubbed out.
He isn't but he does bet on horses and when placing a bet is given stolen money and then goes to jail for extortion.
Being eighteen at the time when I started to replay FFVIII I was more intelligent and had a better understanding of how all the junctioning worked (when you're ten years old and just looking for fun this can prove to be the most confusing thing ever).
You will not be disappointed when you take a hundred hours and play this game straight down to the bone core and suck all the marrow out of it.
It can also be used very effectively as an educational tool when trying to educate straight audiences about this issue and why it has become so important to the gay and lesbian community on all these levels.
Now, I've been playing RPGs for quite some time, and I know a tasteless game when I see one.
I learned a great deal from the film and I hope to see the day when the other 49 states will stop denying gay people the right to marry.
It's easy when taking on a subject like this to show the opposition as cartoon characters and the film tries to show the other side and does a fairly decent job of balancing the argument by not making Gay Marriage opponents too over-the-top or making too much fun of them.
"Saving Marriage"  A Must See  Amos Lassen and Cinema Pride  I had heard great things about Michael Roth's documentary "Saving Marriage" so when I sat down to watch it last night I was ready for something amazing.
I'm a guy, but somewhat of a romantic at heart, so i was overjoyed when i learned that this was going to be a love story.
Now that I'm in LA, and when this happens here, I'll be sure to take part.
From high points when we see both lovely long-term and youthful couples exchanging vows and the election of a gay man to the Massachusetts Parliament, to low points where an elected official of that same government forthrightly denies historical injustices against LGBT people and contemporary realities of abuse, harassment, discrimination and worse, and finishing on the sad reality that bigotry still prevails in much of the American public, a bigotry which could strip same-sex couples of this right, I recommend that everyone with an opinion on same-sex marriage view this.
It showed a lot of promise when the leader of the mercenaries was doing his recruiting of different characters.
The speech that she gave when her husband was leaving her was exactly right.
I caught part of this movie by accident when it first came out.
Many critics have dogged this work since its release saying it spent to much time with the writers, when in fact, many millions of fans were clamoring for more back story and conceptual histories of these wonderfully Machiavellian Aliens.
Granted, all of the participants in the Aliens interviews have nothing but glowing praise for the film, but when you get down to the later entries, people have some surprisingly interesting things to say, including H.R.
Herein lies one of a few major flaws in the plot (why would any of the hoods believe Mr. Big and just accept that he's getting his share later, when none of them even knows who Mr. Big is or what he looks like?)
For the most part this is a sunnier and funnier than usual noir, particularly light in tone when the action goes south of the border, and some of this is probably due to the simpler charms of Payne Â no Bogart or Mitchum though effective enough Â but also the screenplay which keeps the hoods and pretend-hood switching guns and one-upping each other often enough that it becomes more than a little comic.
Of course the robbers are unaware of this when they set up their master plan and it proves to be a major thorn in their side.
old when i bought and finished this game, and its my first FF game ever played.
My Dad took me to see this movie when I was about 8 years old.
Moreover, some commentators have described it as a film noir entry when it really isn't film noir.
Payne wore 3" lifts to get him up to John Wayne/Bob Mitchum height so he would look the hero part better and he puffed up to his full lift's height more than once when confronting the 3 Bad Men.
Gray had only a small supporting role but really sparkled when she was flirting with "her man" of the future.
John Payne is driving his nice Chevy van filled with flowers and minding his own business when some peeping Tom decides to use him for less than legal purposes.
You will see why when you watch it.
The plot gets much more intricate than that, though, when it turns out that the boss of the operation, an ex-cop gone bad, is planning to double cross the other members of the team and collect the reward money for himself.
And it gets more intricate when Payne falls for the boss's daughter, who has come down to visit him at his tropical getaway.
My favorite piece of dialog is when one cop says to Payne's character, Rolfe, "... left school to enlist with the engineers.
Keep in mind, this was during a Cold War time when the TV mega-hit "Dragnet" was professionalizing law enforcement's image nation-wide.
He is accused of participating of the heist, arrested and tortured by the police, loses his job, and when the police recognizes the mistake, he is released.
KANSAS CITY CONFIDENTIAL is a taught and exciting film noir at the tail end of the period when such films were being made.
But he arranges for them to wear masks when they all meet (he is wearing one too) so that none of them know each other or him.
They are given half a playing card as a key of mutual recognition when they are to reunite for the splitting of the money (some six months after the robbery, in a resort in Mexico).
But his plot miscarries when he gets involved with Payne, seeking to clear himself.
Off-screen, he was even smarter, seeing the potential revenue in color films (like Hell's Island and Slightly Scarlet) when selling to television was at most a pipe dream.
Hearing about the darker times of the genre you start to really think how much Slayer, Metallica, Dio, Children of Bodom, MÃ¶ntley Crue and which ever was the band you liked meant for you when you where a kid.
And just days after viewing the disappointingly cursory "American Hardcore", "Metal: A Headbanger's Journey" throws down a challenge in its first scenes when a frazzled youth with a microphone makes sure to add that "punkÂdoes not belong in this world".
His life takes a drastic change when he meets the warm-hearted and gentle Rinoa Heartilly.
However, this developing friendship is attacked when an evil sorceress named Edea gets involved into the lives of The World, with her own plans that could shift the balance of power everywhere.
The cool thing about these documentaries is that having grown up when most of these sounds were just kicking in, you get to relive the excitement and fill in a great deal of blanks about what happened behind the scenes.
The teens get their release at the end of a school day and us older ones get our release when we come home from work.
Just watch out for Gaahl, a wine-filled glass of Cognac and the mention of Satan... you'll understand what I mean when you see it!
The first few seconds into the film, when the all familiar intro of Number of the Beast began, with the clips of metal-heads on screen, I shivered, the hairs on the back of my neck standing up.
It does well with heavy and thrash metal but when it comes to the extremes, it barely touches the surface of styles like the norwegian black metal, and omits important styles such as doom metal, or black metal with folk roots, or "alternative" projects that combine five types of male & female vocals with black metal guitars, heavy metal riffing, flutes, violins, techno/trance rhytms and ambient landscapes all in one song... Metal undeground is very complex and the variety is immense - so it is understandable that fitting all this into 90 minutes borders with the impossible.
Don't know when this will come out officially, but hopefully a distributor out there will take notice, even if its headed for the midnight movie circuit.
There were moments in the film when the hairs on my neck stood up as memories were evoked by what I was watching.
Seeing Rage Against the Machine performing killing in the name of and all the fans singing along reminded me of when I saw them fourteen years ago in room with no more than a hundred people.
Dunn, of course, has his head totally together, which is how he can go head-to-head with metal legends &/or notorious sorts like Tony Iommi, Bruce Dickinson, Lemmy, Alice Cooper, Dee Snider, Dio and Rob Zombie (Geddy Lee is also among the big known interviewees, though it's strange to see him here when he's not really 'metal', at least in league with these guys).
The film captured the buzz in the '80s when heavy metal became the biggest thing going.
I knew it was going to be great when I got my first glimpse of the big chart of metal bands that correctly put KISS far away from the actual musicians.
It featured a number of Australian actors (that happens when you film the movie in Australia) but there were a few recognizable actors, such as Antonio "Hubba Hubba" Sabato Jr. and Joanna Cassidy.
I also had visions of Gilligan's Island dancing in my head when (according to the story) the rag-tag group managed to build very livable huts (with doors and beds no less) after just 3 weeks on the island!
I was just flicking through my channels when I saw Rachel Blakely, I knew her from "The Lost World" so I decided to look at the movie.
I stayed up until really late in the morning.I wasn't about to miss it because who knows when it would have been on again.
Another great thing is that it brings metal heads back to a nostalgic time when Relapse Records was the empire of the metal world, and when the "Death Metal" genre was at its peak.
The low-budget basement-cut feel and shlocky 90's production values add to the underground feeling you get when watching the Traces of Death series!
I loved the characters, and I was annoyed when the couples at the end didn't work out the way I wanted them to.
The both fake bellyaches and when it comes time to eat the results...well, watch the short.
I've always loved Farrah Fawcett, ever since I've seen "The Burning Bed", a couple of months ago I heard that she was going to do a movie for T.V., so I came on the internet and went here to IMDB, when the movie came on I thought it was not the best, but what commercial t.v.
Hollywood is really harsh with aging actresses but this doesn't give them any excuse for trying (unsuccessfully) to look sexy and desirable until...death, especially when it's not in their genes.
Marty runs, and then it fades to present day, which when the movie was made, was 1992.
But when they are getting ready to give it to the NSA guys, they find out that Dr. Janek, the mathematician, has been murdered.
I especially laughed when Redford substituted "help" for "head"!
Redford plays Martin Bishop, who has been on the run from the law since 1969, when his friend Cosmos was caught hacking into some large bank accounts - like the Republican Party's, Richard Nixon's, etc.
While this documentary lost its focus toward the end (when the son--filmmaker Chris Roe--became a bit whiny), I found it insightful, touching, and often funny.
I saw the film when it first came out as a grad student in math, and yes, the math in the film is absurd.
In 1992, when "Sneakers" came out, the Internet was just getting off the ground.
The problem multiples when the C.I.A.
All the little tricks of their trade on display are each a delight, from setting off fire alarms to being on the other end of the phone when the fire service is subsequently called.
I was in 10th grade when Space 1999 was first released and being a science major I became an instant fan.
Although I remember too many things that left me scratching my head, even from the superior first season - why did the command centre have exterior windows that could be opened when the Moon was given an atmosphere?
With all of the Eagles that crashed or were otherwise disabled, how did they always seem to be able to get another one aloft, and how were they fast enough, given the scramble of Alan Carter to keep up with the Moon when it first left Earth's orbit, to reach the base again when outside the gravity of the orb.
I was immensely disappointed when I saw this.
A rare jewel among shows of the science-fiction genre, which still had the courage to try even when it fell short of the viewers' expectations...
I saw the show when I was a teenager and loved it instantly.
And I still do, as I observed when I saw it again more than 20 years later.
I could go on & on about this show, as others have, but I don't need to cover old ground--those of us who saw this show as youngsters when it first came out, well... it was an amazing & hypnotic thing.
Years later, when I finally got my hands on the box sets of both series, I was destined to be.... disappointed?
It is a good script, fine cast and the atmosphere of the time when it has been broadcast.
Who is to blame when she gets punished?
A prominent brain surgeon (John Colicos) is arrested for the murder of his wife, but what should the hospital do when they need his talents to save a dying child?
Of course, the biggest joke in this movie is Eddie himself; he is so full of himself here and believes, even when he is being a jerk, he's in the right.
Things are made worse when you realize that NO ONE could ever get away with the things Murphy does here.
Twenty years later in the unfolding story it becomes indeed a razor's edge on which to tread when former wife Elizabeth again encounters John, who is now known as Erik Kessler, middle aged, graying, and has difficulty getting around.
It occurred when the film in the camera ran out, apparently.
I'd never heard of this film before TCM started screening it as a late night filler - and initially woke up in the middle of it when Holloway and co were singing the poignant and totally unexpected The World is for the Young.
I was ten years old when the British Invasion reached the shores of North America in 1964, and I was fourteen when the Hippie Revolution took-off in 1967-68.
These blokes looked like advertising men when compared to Big Brother or the Dead.
I don't suppose that I would have liked it when it first came out because it would have been bunched in with all of the other `rock' musicals of it's time, trying to compete for the `young' in-crowd.
Now, when first hearing about it, and possibly even sitting through it, one word that may or may not come to mind is pathetic, or possibly desperate, maybe even typical.
I have just seen the movie and i think it's really cool The thing i liked the most is the plot I wouldn't change a thing about it it was perfect But the thing's i didn't think were all that great Was the color of the 2000 Mitsubishi eclipse silver They should have gone for something like red or blue How ever the underground lighting kit was cool But that's not the end the other thing i did'NT like was The 2004 Pontiac GTO with the 350 horse LS1 under the hood It would have been better to have used the 05 model with the 400 horse LS2 THAT WOULD HAVE BURNED SOME SERIOUS RUBBER Also the should have used NOS nitrous instead of ZEX They should have of raced the GTO at least once to see what kind of power it had the thing that would have been really cool is to have battled the eclipse against the GTO Another thing that stumped me was how did Dennis hopper know about The drift trick with the hand brake when he was driving the eclipse
And when we watched the movie, from the beginning I thought "here we go again, another bang em up, chase em, over the top action movie".
Errol Flynn is well-cast as the dashing hero Miles Hendon, who comes to protect Edward when he's taken for a beggar.
I also was amused when one of the twins pronounced his family "TU-TOR" instead of "Tudor."
I remember waiting in line on May 25, 1987 , opening day, when I was 14 years old eagerly anticipating this movie.
Think back to the first movie when he pretended to be gay in order to get into the hotel buffet.
By accident, each is mistaken for the other and when the king dies, the pauper may be crowned instead of the rightful prince.
Of course the truth is he is still too young (in 1547 he is only 11) and he really can only rule in his own right when he reaches adult age (presumably 21).
Now kids, if you're reading, when you do drugs, you make stupid movies like this, so don't do drugs!
Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the theatre, there's Jack Hammer.
He lives as a security guard in a abandoned machine shop after losing his cushy day job to drugs, when his best friend OD's and dies on the street in a bad part of town.
And, for some reason, when he is injected with what looks like radioactive waste, it actually gives him superpowers, and he regains all his stamina and is able to jump onto rooftops from the ground (after falling off of them).
You are supposed to care about these people, but how can you when they just pop out of nowhere?
Like in the beginning when he kills his first victim, and his face gets smashed in with the jackhammer...oh my.
The first summed up what Beverly Hills was like in the early 80's but this one shows us the world indulgent Americans live in when they have more money than they can spend.
As Axel says 'These rich people loose their minds and want to live in a donut', when describing to a building foreman that there are not supposed to be any right angles in the house he is about to 'steal'.
There is ample gore but you have to wonder when one of the potential victims is going to figure out the obvious; just run far enough that Jack runs out of extension cord!
Watch for the scene when he shoots a guy THROUGH a skyscraper, especially for the shadows thrown by the beer sign he's under!
Beverly Hills Cop 2 was a smash hit when it was released to theaters in 1987.
The main character, golgo 13 is a character so stoic, so stonefaced, that he hardly cracks even a hint of emotion even when in the act of having hot sex.
My favorite scene is when he goes head to head with Snake (a repulsive, toothless villain who uses bladed yo-yos to kill his victims.
The scene in which Duke's car speeds along the beach, or when Gold and Silver (Two of the hired mercenaries) attack him in Dawson's office building near the climax of the film are genius.
Gazillionaire industrialist Leonard Dawson throws a birthday party for his son, Leonard Jr., aboard his private cruise ship, a lavish ceremony in which he names his son heir and successor to his empire, but Dawson's elation is shattered when his son is surgically shot through the forehead with but a single bullet, killing him instantly.
I think it may come off a tame when compared to the later excesses in Japanese animation, such as post-apocalyptic slug-fest filled with showering viscera, city- leveling psychic children and titanic robots, female ninjas with poisonous naughty bits, and the ever-popular spectacle of sailor-suited schoolgirls having their every orifice explored by the tentacles and other bits of demonic rapists just before they explode in a torrent of offal and demonic DNA, but Golgo 13 has all of them beat for sheer quality entertainment that even your parents might dig.
Identity is an above average horror film and I am always rooting for B-movie filmmakers when they break into classier material(the writer of jack frost 1 & 2).
Watch the movie and you'll get what I mean when i say "A one man movie".
Especially near the end when Cusack's character is figuring out what the connection is with the driving licences.
So all the old characters do their thing at the beginning, but it's when we get to Beverly Hills that things get all messed up.
Especially funny is the one in the gun club when he supposedly brings in a bag of " plutonium nitrate highly explosive soundseaking projectlies."
I envision those loose-lipped test-audiences (comprised of societal castes who have nothing better to do with their Tuesday afternoons) believing that the movie was taking place in real time, only to be chagrined when it is revealed that most of the action was occurring in a psychopath's disturbed mind.
By the end of the second act (after the film's most neck-hair-raising moment, when all the corpses at the Motel are found to be missing), it is revealed that the Motel scenes have been taking place within a psychopath's mind, and that each Motel character was merely one of the multiple personalities of the psychopath.
On a dark and stormy night 11 strangers have to take refuge in an isolated motel when a rainstorm turns into a monsoon.
I had never even heard of it until recently; when an observant video store clerk noticed how many thrillers I was hiring and suggested it.
Still, maybe the Identity is just easier to figure out when you've seen tens of rubber reality flicks.
Most of them are lying to each other in some way when they first meet, and even some of the ones who know each other already are also lying to each other.
So when you watch this film, try to be fair in judging in it.
Powell delivers his lines with eye-twinkling charm but he is no match for his leading lady: You know how all actresses, without exception act during the ball/party scene, when they flirt with their leading men while they are slightly tipsy?
However, in the week between seeing the trailer -- and when the flick actually played at my friendly neighborhood theater -- I'd goofed up at home.
When will someone tell him that his era ended when the Eighties did?
It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were in grad school that we stumbled upon this.
Laura Leighton...all of 27 when she made this movie...was great as the woman so full of life she's able to revive this guy's heart.
Hmmmm , maybe that is telling in itself when it comes to our beloved public servants, but I shall digress.
However I must be fair, one good spot was when Hurricane gave a Noble a neck breaker off the top rope.
The last sequence with inserted song of Russian rock band Nautilus Pompilius is really great, whole seeming reference to American and Western action films gets toppled upside-down,because when credit titles appear, suddenly the song declare:"Boodby, America, where I've never been.".
Economy collapse of 1990s in Russia when criminals were ruling everything played it's role.
Brat 2 appeared in 2000, when everything in Russia started to change.
Raw power is nothing when it's used against the TRUTH.
The secondary value of this work is to respond to immigration problem of 80s-90s when "Iron curtain" broke down.
I don't know why it is written that he saw no action, but as usual, when a soldier comes back from war, they have seen men killed as a matter of course and have likely killed people themselves.
I am reminded when Margarita in Bulgakov's classic says, "I like it when someone does things well."
I caught this amateurish effort on late-late-night Showtime when the only alternatives were infomercials.
The "tenor" and star of the joke is an overweight trucker who rediscovers a lost love (I'm guessing it's a spoof of an opera diva) when she comes to town during an undefined concert tour.
This epi certainly poses a good question: what happens when evil collides with evil, as Serling himself puts it.
Unintentional laughs abound when his work is shown, and is of a very low quality.)
Again, the budget must be kept in mind when appreciating the animation involved.
Just as Mulan worked in English and not so much when dubbed into Chinese, I believe this film to be the opposite, appealing in far greater amounts in its original Cantonese version.
It's probably the movie that my parents watched in the secret of their bedroom when I was pay attention to my little cars.
Not reaching the African coastline Holmes and the surviving passengers were rescued by a British freighter-The British Soldier-just when Holmes himself was about, in him feeling that he's become a burden to those on board, to throw himself overboard!
But, it's well to keep in mind that a Utilitarian standard is used all the time when making life-and-death decisions in wartime.
On a strict application of equality, no person should be sacrificed for the benefit of another, and when human life is held as the supreme value, some version of pacifism would appear the logical conclusion.
However, when rescue comes and the pressure is off, they revert back to convention, leaving Power to take the heat and deal with the law.
The one drawback is when the drama shifts abruptly into documentary-style at the very end.
It went under the ship and bounced along the bottom and when it exploded, it cut the ship right in half.
It was down faster than the Lusitania when it was torpedoed.
The viewer can identify so completely with the daunting task facing the ship's officer (TYRONE POWER) when making life and death decisions with regard to how many people can use the lifeboat when a sunken ship leaves them adrift at sea.
Tyrone Power was at a stage in his career when he wanted more serious roles rather than stay forever fixed in the minds of movie-goers as a swashbuckling star.
It is one of those rare, extremely rare gems that has gone out of print, probably forgotten by most, but when found will provide the most gut-wrenching 97 minutes of cinematic viewing.
He is unable to rely on anyone else - a fact that is brought to his attention not only by the actions of a critical Stephen Boyd at one point, but by the way Mai Zetterling and James Hayter distance themselves from him when the lifeboat is finally picked up.
All powerful in his unwanted element while everyone's lives depended on him, he is all alone when the dangers for the survivors pass away.
And it demonstrates that Tyrone Power was a mighty dramatic performer when he was given the right material.
This was practically Tyrone Power's last hurrah; in his early forties when the movie was filmed, he died of a heart attack on a project shortly thereafter (as his actor-father Tyrone Power Sr. had before him).
I liked the music played when the bad guy was around.
Like everyone else my age, I read "Dennis The Menace" comic strips and comic books when I was a kid.
I saw this film when it first came out and I loved it then and still do so I'm pleased to have finally bought it on DVD.
It's really a good family movie with swear words or anything in this movie, (except for when Mr. Wilson says the abbreviation for 'gosh darn.').
he'll cook up a whole pot of beans, even when he isn't hungry.
I was questioning Christopher Lloyd's role when i saw this in theaters because that almost overshadowed the fact that this was a family film and his role as a robber caught me off guard.
I didn't like his role until the end, him and Mason Gamble have a great moment together in the end when Dennis is torturing him, i laughed to tears on that seen, the knife nailing him the butt.
She's involved with a ruthless organized crime syndicate that is running firearms to Central America, and when police chief Bogomil is gunned down, Foley decides he's going to head on back to southern California to solve the case himself again.
It gets a little cheesy at times though, like when he gets into the bad guys' office by pretending to be a delivery boy delivering highly unstable plutonium capsules in - get this - a brown paper bag, but overall it stays in the same vein as the original and may even be better in a lot of ways.
Mrs. Wilson adores Dennis and often volunteers to watch him when the Mitchell's list of possible baby-sitters is exhausted.
It's funny, sweet and makes you feel good when it's through.
The music composed by the legendary Jerry Goldsmith is perfect especially for the scene when we fist see Christopher Lloyd.
The film has non-stop laughs especially the scenes with Matthau and I just love the scene when the end credits are playing.If you want to laugh look no further than Dennis the Menace!
I have watched the cartoon here and there when I was a kid and read a few of the comic strips.
I saw this movie in seventh grade on a free day in school, when I heard that we were watching it, I had heard that it did not do to well, but then I decided to just watch it.
I am telling you, I was laughing my head off when I saw this, this movie is hysterical, it has got really big laughs, it is totally a slap-happy time, you must see this, you will be laughing yourself silly!
One more thing, I don't know why I really thought that this movie was funny, but I was really enjoying it when I watched it.
The only recollection I have of Wilson even speaking civilly to Dennis before he 'ran away' was when he briefly explained why he kept his coins in a safe.
But this is a brilliant film when viewed as a spoof.
The 2 main villains are very menacing, even though we hardly see Jurgen Prochnow, he was still very menacing when on screen.
One of the funniest parts in the film is, Reinhold's sudden obsession with huge guns, and it had some pretty powerful moments, especially when Capt Bogomil gets shot.
I first watched The Killing Edge back in the mid 1990's when I found it on the bargain-price rental shelf at our local video shop.
The killing Edge follows one survivor, an ex-soldier who survived the holocaust thanks to being in a motorway tunnel when the attack happened, make his way through the contaminated wastelands in search of the wife and child he left at home on the morning of the war.
However when Zasu Pitts took over it was hard to imagine her as a rational and witty schoolteacher, who would never miss a clue.
The penguin's behavior is immediately explained when a corpse suddenly plunges into the tank!
Unfortunately, my video store that I rent at does not have the second Beverly Hills Cop or the third, so when I stopped by Best Buy and saw the sequel for $6.99, I thought it might be worth a buy.
The visit is interrupted when Isidore (the Jewish kid in the class) points out (as in the summary line) that there is a man inside what he calls the "duck" pool.
But in the Penguin Pool Murder she wins over James Gleason by the sheer force of her character, and when he finally succumbs she characteristically responds, "I thought you'd never ask!"
William F. Cody was all of 13 when he was riding for them.
So when we see Charlton Heston doing all he's doing as Buffalo Bill in this film Pony Express, he's really playing a thirteen year old living out a fantasy dream of having both Rhonda Fleming and Jan Sterling chasing him.
I first saw this movie when I was eight years old and loved it so much that I immediately went to the library to read up on these historical characters and events.
Was I upset when I found that so much of the plot had been fabricated?
I fell in love with her immediately and wanted to marry her when I grew up.
He no more worshipped the devil than I do but he knew a potentially successful schtick when he saw it; a schtick he readily admits to having parlayed into 24 years of personal appearances, a mammoth "satanic" church, and hundreds of YouTube videos and BlogTalkRadio shows.
I remember when this video came out in video stores like 1987-1988.
Overall, this offers almost nothing in the way of laughs except one quick scene when Claude first meets the bulldog, face-to-face.
I lost interest in this show when i was 7.They used gibberish 24/7.
I was peeved when Olie told me that the were evil toys trying to hurt me.
You can tell a movie franchise is in trouble when it starts killing off its main characters and that's what happens here when Ronny Cox is shot (Foley's foul-mouthed boss, Inspector Todd, would be killed off in the next movie).
I wish they had all these great shows when I was growing up.
Then, when one of the characters knows where the villains hide out and what kills them she decides to go to the local battle of the bands show instead of trying to get people to help her and kill the creatures?
Or if your really into this type of bad film and enjoy watching a film thats so bad, that you just have to watch it to see where films can go when handed to complete incompetents.
Neon Maniacs,great movie by far one of my top 5 greatest films.The movie is so great because of the great original plot and characters...have u ever seen a movie when maniacs are killed by...water?No then check this out.I love alot of movies this definetly is one of them and its also hard to get so if u ever find it get it because even if u didnt like it its one of those movies when u cant not see it and u have to judge yourself!
I mean, there are tons of movies these days that are so bad that you say something like that about them, but it's a rare occurrence when you can apply that statement literally.
Usually when there are some freak monsters running around in a horror film there is only a small few, but in this movie there was a small army of monsters.
Meanwhile, the Neon Maniacs, forced to disappear into the night when the cops showed up and rescued Natalie that night, aren't about to accept a loss and call it a day, they take pride in their undefeated record!
Enter the pseudo-heroic shy, fashion-victim soft-rocking boyfriend and a horror movie fan that is the only one who really investigates what is going on (Natalie spends a lot of time by the swimming pool when she's not going ga-ga for the boyfriend), and someone finally realizes that, oh yeah, there's these things and they're wreaking havoc on our city.
But when you combine it with the fact that half the time, it doesn't seem like anyone's reacting like their are psychotic weapon welding monsters running around the neighborhood, there's no reason to care about what goes on on-screen.
'Baby lied when she told me...' - 'I love the choice you made...' - The battle of the bands ROCKS man.
I rented it on video when it came out and really enjoyed it.
Back then I thought it sucked, but a couple a months ago I was strolling through my video store when I decided to give it another try.
The story loses some of its impact around the hour, when the tempo is constantly interfered with lousy rock 'n roll concert sequences (an often-returning problem in 80's horror).
It gives you a strange warm happy feeling inside when you watch it.
And when it's over, you think about it--chortle to yourself over it.
this was an awesome movie the chemistry between Karishma Kapoor and Salman Khan is always amazing...hope to see them two again...the story starts with Karishma being the ditsy girl who does everything wrong the two brothers Sanjay and Salman of course start to hate her but after a few mistakes Karishma saves Sanjay's life and slowly the two brothers begin to fall in love with her but Karishma only falls back in love with Salman but keep their relationship a secret things turn when Sanjay's grandma and dad want to marry him with Karishma after hearing this Salman and Karishma break up and Karishma agrees to marry Sanjay but at the night of the engagement Sanjay reveals the one night when Salman was drunk and started to sleep-talks spilled about him and Kairshma and Sanjay says that Salman and Krishma should be together so Karishma and Salman marry instead
This gave it the distinction of being on the theatre screens when the Sunday morning sneak-attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7th.
The trouble with the giant, metal creatures are in progress of wreaking their brand of havoc on the Good Folks of Metropolis when the Cartoon Short opens.
While I am no fan of the Fleischers' other series such as Popeye and Betty Boop because of their incredibly similar plots, they are far superior to the Superman cartoons when it comes to animation quality.
After all, any non-zombified fan has to admit that the cartoons have rather poor animation when compared to the Looney Toons and MGM cartoons of the era.
This 1941 animated introduction to Superman had a different "take" on it in that they explain that when the baby from Krypton crash-landed on earth, the infant was taken to an orphanage and raised.
Then again, a classy animated production is no surprise when you know and have seen the work of either of the Fleischer brothers, Max or Dave, who first became noticed with some extremely clever animated work way back in the silent film era ("Koko The Clown" and "Felix The Cat," as two prime examples).
I first went to see Dumb and Dumber, when it came to the cinemas, and brought my entire family along.
From the first moment (when you see Jim Carrey ask a lady about the way) to the final moment (the two dimwits walks away on the freeway), I cried of laughter.
Don't miss the following scenes: the Toilett scene, the beerdrinking scene, the one where Jim pours poop-potion in Jeff Daniels coffee (the result is seen in the toilett scene), and the final scene when the goofballs turns down an offering to become oilrubbers for beatiful models.
Some highlights are in the restaurant with Sea Bass, in the car with the hitchhiker, the guy at the phone booth, and when Lloyd finds out just how cold Harry's hands really are.
I first saw this on TBS when they aired it last year and I laughed harder than ever.
I loved it when Lloyd says "Wanna hear the most annoying sound in the world?
Even when they aren't speaking, their body language alone is enough to elicit huge laughs.
I will treasure this movie forever, and even when I watch it the 101st time, I know it'll make me laugh... and laugh... and laugh till it hurts.
Our tale begins when Lloyd (Jim Carrey) is escorting a young woman named Mary Swanson (the gorgeous Lauren Holly, who Carrey eventually married and then divorced) to an airport.
Jodorowsky made this film when he was in Paris, where he had joined the troupe of celebrated pantomime Marcel Marceau in 1954, and become a part of the surrealist movement.
That is obvious when Vitus finds out the padlock (at air port) locked...
What is with his mother using English words especially when she must be annoying?
But to return to the movie , Vitus loves life and his parents , even if is hard for him to express that , he is a wunderkind after all, even when he names his educator at kindergarten Obelix he does not do that out of being rude.
Vitus own reward is the interest he takes in his teen-aged baby sitter, but when the parents see in horror the surveying tape they have installed at home, they are horrified for watching their son being just a kid having fun.
He is brought up to constantly improve upon his talent as a piano player until one day, when he decides on his own to take the piano at his own pace.
His grandfather proves to be a wonderful source of inspiration and guides Vitus when it comes to understanding the ways of the world.
But how is a boy supposed to have a "normal childhood" when he's eons ahead of his peers in intelligence and talent and when even his own teachers are intimidated by his knowledge?
Vitus is played by Fabrizio Bursoni as a delightful precocious 6 year old then by TEO GHEORGHIU when he is 12.
Joshua's posh Upper West Side "haute bourgeoisie" or "Ã¼ber-yuppie" life takes a dive when a new baby enters the scene.
His college-boy-jovial hedge-fund-trader dad Brad (Sam Rockwell) is videoing the infant, and when Joshua ((Jacob Kogan) plays one of his virtuoso pieces, they just ask him to quiet down.
Even when he says "Mommy?
But where Joshua only occasionally sees his simpatico uncle, Vitus gets to spend a lot of time with his wonderfully relaxed and entertaining granddad (Bruno Ganz, anything but a Hitler this time) , who makes things and goes on walks with the boy and talks about his dreams of being a pilot way back when.
The baby is fine for less than a week when she begins to cry constantly, which brings Abby back to the shaky state she was in during Joshua's early stages--and then some.
So when do we get it here?
There are actually several moments when the main character is conversing with his superior in the FBI headquarters, and well it looked like they were shot in some abandoned warehouse.
I remember watching this every year when I was a kid.
I don't understand how none of my friends have heard of it, but I'd love to get my hands on a copy so people won't think I'm crazy when I walk around the office saying "hupcha hupcha quick like a bunny".
The best was when a scrawny, nasally, high pitched sounding bat snatched up his little easter basket with his tiny feet and began singing "Here comes Peter Easter Bat.." only to face plant into a tree.
To this day I get strange looks from friends when I try to describe this surreal scene.
It is the Islamic concept of "God-consciousness".Someone having "taqwa" has the constant awareness of God's omnipresence in his life and he is supposed to be in total submission to God.The movie tells the story of Muharrem,a simple minded,unobtrusive middle-aged man who lives alone.While he runs the errands in the place he works, he spends most of his time in the local dargah(a Sufi shrine built over the grave of a revered religious figure)by engaging himself with total abstinence and dhikr(a form of devotion,in which the worshiper is absorbed in the rhythmic repetition of the name of God or his attributes)Muharrem's uneventful life starts to take a bit different course when he is given to duty(by the leader dervish of the religious brotherhood)to take care of the financial matters like collecting the monthly rents for the religious order.
He wet-dreams of sleeping with the same woman every time.A day when he really feels suffocated he takes to the streets and he sees the same woman in a jewelery store.
Everything escalates when he comes face to face with the woman he desires...
The opening scene may seem a bit too staged, but Leung's facial expressions when she kills the guy and the cop is just priceless to endure.
Oscar did it again this year (2005), when it again picked a dull Spanish movie few will ever see out of the best pool I can remember, with "Der Undergang" (Downfall), "Un long dimanche de fianÃ§ailles" (A Very Long Engagement), and "Shi mian mai fu" ("House of Flying Daggers).
I stumbled upon this film, and was tempted not to watch it when the first minutes were so quiet.
It reflects the situation that a man faces when he comes back to his homeland after living abroad many years.
But in the Whately house, there is a room that houses a secret, and I have to say when that door is opened that it may actually provide one of the better depictions of one of Lovecraft's "unspeakable, unnameable, un-whateverable" creatures than any other film that I've seen.
So I sat back and enjoyed looking at Dean...at a time when he was a skinny, pale curly-haired (no, I don't think it's a bad perm...it's Dean) tripping little dude in a long black coat and bell-bottom pants.
To make matters worse, the story was not even presented in a very coherent manner - maybe that's a bit harsh as i did fall asleep once or twice - ok maybe that's when the 'horror bit' happened before anyone tells me!
The film's night sequences at the end as a band of angry villagers, following behind Begley and Bochner, are attacked by a creature( that looses itself from a locked room in Jaffe and Stockwell's home), within the woods drove me nuts..you can't see a damn thing unless the director lets loose those color schemes which operate loudly as the monster's "sight" when it confronts possible victims.
when the opening scene was playing.
But when watched alone at night, without a critical attitude, it is creepy and effective as only an old, cheap horror movie can be.
I saw this movie when I was around 13 years old.I felt the movie seemed a bit like a "movie of the week".
they overdue the drama when they don't need to and there is no excitement or fun listening to a bunch of kids whining about their sex and love lives.
I saw this show when it first aired and it wasn't as bad as they make out to be.
And about things being left opened and unsaid or whatever, that's what usually happens when a show gets canceled.
Set in the twilight hours in a no-names urbane city an ambitious DA named Ford Cole (Liotta, who is also a producer on this dreadful film) who is summoned to the police station when one of his younger protÃ©gÃ©es (and current lover), Nora Timmer (mannequin Blalock) has been involved in a lethal shooting after her claims of being raped by her assailant, Isaac Duperde.
She was, as LL's character hinted when he said that even the FBI had been penetrated, the dirty FBI agent.
I had not heard of this movie when me and my friend picked it up at Blockbuster.
Ray Liotta plays a district attourney running for mayor when his DA is raped by a supposed psychotic music store clerk and then murders him.
Things get even more dicey when we discover that the D.A.
To start with, there's something inherently self-defeating and pointless in constructing a narrative from two widely conflicting viewpoints - a la "Rashomon" - when one of the supposed eyewitnesses is already dead and, thus, unable to personally relate his side of the story.
The first time, I was involved with doing something else and when I would glance up, I was like oh, okay.
The film will focus on Alyosha's travels in a minute and careful manner, observing one such instance in which the failure to identify the moment when it is apparently necessary to bribe someone, almost getting caught out and rectifying the situation before applying the said learning later on under different conditions.
WWI newlyweds Claudette Colbert and Orson Welles meet heartbreak when he goes missing in action and is written off as dead.
Ever the gemutlich gentleman, Welles keeps his cards close to his vest, even when talking about the "situation overseas" with the strapping lad he now realizes is his son, who wants to enlist in the Canadian Air Force.
I found it un-involving, and when you don't care about the characters, then you don't care who's innocent or guilty and the film loses all effectiveness.
I wouldn't call this a Main event movie, but a thought-provoking Indie dish when you want to try something different from the normal polished Hollywood script.
So when I started watching this, knowing that Brando is playing and that its an espionage movie including WW2 elements I was pretty excited.
This film may have even more relevance today than in 1980, when it was released.
Best line is when Brando finds a dead frog in his pool and says, "I hope he's got Blue Cross."
Caine when within days Neeley's estranged wife Kay, Beatrice Straight, is also fund murdered in her Jacuzzi with the same murder weapon that murdered her husband!
Lisa was so mysterious that even when the movie was finally over you didn't quite know on just who's-Let.
That said the movies only redeeming qualities was it's similarities of Brando's character to Dick Chaney, and the speech in the end when Scott says "Your the reason why old people have to eat out of garbage cans!".
Doesn't make a lot of sense when you think about it.
Detective Barney Caine (George C. Scott) gets involved in an increasingly twist-laden plot that begins when an old friend of his is found murdered.
He opposes the ultimate "establishment" and is weighed and found wanting when the time comes to take the final step to expose the ruling classes' determination to keep the lower class lower and the super upper class on top.
I saw this movie when it came out in 1980 and enjoyed it immensely with all of the twists and turns keeping me thinking the whole time.
Does everyone need to have everything shown to them in a movie or am I just one of the few who's head doesn't hurt when I use it for what it was designed to do?
Let me know when they are planning to air the rest of the show or if it is still in production.
Yes, I remember when I got my first taste of Battlestar Galactica for the first time back in 1986 when it showed on BBC2 at 6pm.
Racing to get back to the Galactica, one of them gets blown to bits when a Cylon attack force races towards the fleet of Battlestars.
I loved Battlestar Galactica when I was a kid.
It has some very strong moments, for example when the treason of the Cylons is discovered too late to save the human colonies and fleet.
Or when Apollo's brother is shot down and killed just seconds before reaching the safe haven Galactica.
why in god's name would you leave your colonies unguarded, when you haven't signed a treaty yet.
But when Count Isblis (Patrick Macnee) says to Baltar that in order for his (Isblis') voice to be that of the Imperious Leader, it would've had to have been transcribed into machine leader a thousand yahrens ago.
Unfortunately, when the transition was made from the original concept of several special-event TV movies to a regular series, the conventions of 70's TV took over.
And let's not forget the other memorable stories, such as the discovery of Commander Cain & the Battlestar Pegasus and when the Galactica found Kobol and discovered some of the origins of men.
Battlestar Galactica was initially a major ratings success when it debuted in 1978 with a pilot episode detailing the destruction of human civilisation by the robotic Cylons - chrome-plated disco stormtroopers with metallic voices that were the last word in Casio home synthesiser effects.
But when the pilot episode won huge ratings, the full-length series that was hastily rushed into production abandoned such complex and gritty storylines for more puerile scripts that inevitably involved lots of re-used clips of explosions.
And what concern with fancy hair-do's can the women have when their hair is bound down with knotted kerchiefs.
This film certainly caused quite a stir when it was released in 1978.
This is the story of a young girl growing up in a brothel in Storyville, New Orleans when the brothels were very popular and just before they were all shut down.
The limit of sickness is when the girl's virginity is auctioned.
And at the finale is obvious how her innocence is still there when her mom comes back with a new dad for her and wants to take her to a better life, and she says to her husband/photographer "Can't we all go?"...
In the latter case the viewers personal reaction will govern the response to such eye candy, (typically for example, regardless of whether or not they themselves appreciate it, many viewers feel that this is very inappropriate for younger viewers and all films should provide advance warning when it is present).
Another film, French Quarter, which was released the same year as Pretty Baby, was the story of an orphaned girl who had been strictly brought up on a farm, but who had had to take refuge in a city brothel to avoid starvation when her parents died.
Ultimately this is the powerful message from Pretty Baby that makes it such an exceptional film; but because the Director decided to employ a totally non-judgmental documentary type presentation and to minimise any direct emotional appeal, most viewers probably only recognize it when scenes returned to their memory during the hours and days after they left the cinema, and I do not believe its rare combination of beautiful imagery and haunting power has so far been brought out adequately by the comments on this database.
And when Storyville was still running, the Red Light District would promote each slut it had.
Puberty is the time when the body is ready to conceive and reproduce.
So, really, I should probably be disgusted with Carradine, but why do I feel so sad when Sarandon shows up at the end, after he and Shields have been married, to take her away?
Pretty Baby, by Louis Malle raises a myriad of questions when viewed almost thirty years after its creation.
Seeing it now I could feel the nags and the amazement when experiencing Malle's audacity.
Yes; in this day of greater awareness of child abuse it's shocking to learn that through out history little or no thought was given to the age of children when it came to sex,all of us,if we go back in our family genealogy will find a very young great ###### great female who is responsible for us being here.
And to you Christians,don't forget that Mary was 13 or 14 when Christ was born,she also was betrothed to Joseph at age 12, which was the custom then.
However, despite a notable cast (Keith Carradine, Susan Sarandon, Barbara Steele and Gerrit Graham), the film only really comes to life - after a rather wandering first half - when the Lolita-esquire elements of the Brooke Shields character take center stage.
She's been raised in a whorehouse by her prostitute mother and takes things in stride that for most people would be traumatic, such as having her virginity auctioned off at the age of twelve and being left at the brothel for a time when her mother leaves to get married.
As he tells the curious Violet, "I have no time for hate or love," and when he falls for her it seems to be a surprise to him.
He was a great story teller, even when the stories were a bit thin, as Polly Platt's is here.
Keith Carradine balked when Shields is taken away from him, for instance.
This film was largely shunned when it was first released.
Besides Jason Isaac, a very good English actor who, who when asked if he was tough like the sadist on "The Brotherhood" said, no, I'm a little Jew from Liverpool, or words to that effect, and Fionnula Flanagan there was nothing to recommend that show, but Chris Isaak--long since gone.
I have been a fan of Chris Isaak for some time and was thrilled when I heard that he would be starring in his own television series (for those of you who have seen his antics on the Jay Leno Tonight Show, know how funny he can be) But what I wasn't prepared for was how smart and clever it was as well.
I laughed hysterically when Brett Michaels from the band Poison had a guest appearance!
And everyone will wet their pants when seeing the episode where Chris dates a female police officer who is CRAZY!
I used to watch it with my twin sister on VHS from the video shop when we were about 6 or 7.
About four months ago, I was surfing about on YouTube when I type "The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog" up.
I used to watch this show when I was growing up.
"Beau Pere" was banned in Ontario when it first came out (the ban has since been lifted).
It looks like he thinks he is doing her a favour when he yields to her and has sex with her.
However, I still couldn't help but feel uncomfortable watching this, especially since Besse was about that age when she made the film and appears bare-breasted several times.
Remy even gives up his career in a cowardly way when he latches on to a newer lover, who also is a superior talent as a pianist.
The way his character, Remy, is portrayed, one feels relieved when Marion discards him...it would be impossible for her not to be able to be able to improve on the spineless clod.
In fact, it seems almost distracting when compared to what Blier really wants to get across - the divide between adolescence and adulthood and how seemingly frivolous sexual encounters can ruin lives forever.
"Ballad of a Soldier" along with "Andrei Rublev" is one of my favorite Russian films ever and one of the great movies made in USSR during KhruschevÂ´s so-called "thaw" period in the late 1950s and early 1960s when soviet filmmakers got a certain amount of an artistic freedom and were less controlled by the Soviet state.
Yes, I am aware of the fact the rather vulgar and tasteless subject line entirely misfits the overall tone of this film, but when else am I going to have the chance to use this clichÃ©d saying in a review?
RÃ©mi tries very hard (honestly, he does) to resist the temptation, but what's a lonely man to do when a scantily clad young gal keeps throwing herself at him and continues to sneak into his bed at night?
I was up late watching HBO when this movie came on.
The actors themselves are no slouches when it comes to acting, and have been in several top-of-the-line feature films.
Granted, the plot is a familiar one, but when coupled with the WC plot as a whole, it takes on a whole new meaning, and real actors are just what was needed to bring that out.
so it is good but when you get into the movie part it can get bad.
"Ballada o soldate" has one of the most poignant sequences of all war movies:when the mother holds only for a few minutes, her dear boy in her arms,it's impossible to hold back your tears .I saw the movie for the first time thirty years ago and I have never forgotten it.Far from politics ,"ballada o soldate" is an universal poem,enhanced by a magnificent grandiose score,which enhances the simple beauty of the pictures,climaxing on a symphony for the finale.
Aliocha's furlough is so short (48 hours) and it's such a long way to his dear home.His journey becomes an odyssey ,but ,unlike Ulysses,his happiness will be short-lived.He and the girl form one of the most touching,lovable and innocent couple you will see on a screen.Their simple joys ,particularly when they share the soldier's food,or when they meet again in the desert station,are the ones which make a life worthwhile,even in the hell which surrounds them.
Perhaps the best episode was when Betty White's character was cheating with Cloris Leachman's character's husband.
"The Mary Tyler Moore Show" was a classic sitcom about single 30s something Mary Richards,moving to new town Minneapolis,when her relationship breaks down,she gets an apartment through old friend Phyllis(Chloris Leachman)at the start,causing friction with Rhoda(Valerie Harper)from upstairs,the friendship of Mary and Rhoda becoming one of the backbones of the series until Valerie Harper spun off to her own spin off success "Rhoda",after four seasons.
Mary gets a job at WJM-TV,the local news station with the lowest ratings but warmest people,she meets gruff but caring Lou Grant(Ed Asner)the classic moments in the series would be when Lou would say "come into my office Mary".
Betty White was a welcome addition in season 4 as man hungry "Happy Homemaker",Sue-Ann Nivens,the episode when she has an affair with Phyllis'unseen husband Lars in "The Lars Affair" was a classic,Sue Anne helping fill the void as "the blond darling" when Phyllis left after season 5 for her own spin off series "Phyllis".
Amongst all the laughs there were touching,"real" moments of life like retirement or "The Lou and Edie Story" when Lou's wife Edie leaves him or "Chuckles Bites The Dust",the best known episode of TMTMS when the station's clown,Chuckles,dies in a bizarre elephant crushing,Mary is disgusted at the sick jokes until she gets the giggles at the funeral,then there is a debate about people's reactions to death,all very deep indeed.
I saw the first episode when it first aired in prime time back in September of 1970 when I was nine years old.
30+ years later you still have to reference this show when discussing the Great American Sitcom.
I never caught MTM when it was originally on.
Even if you weren't born when this series aired, you have to see it.
There is no equal when it come to sophistication, timeliness or relevance.
There was this episode when his friend dies in a car accident and Alex was supposed to be with him but lucked out because of his selfishness.
He also tells the shrink that when he was a kid he was just as normal as any kid playing with toys and stock market.
This was one of the best shows of its kind when it was running.
Shows major misstep occured during their final year when they tried to become too socially concious.
You can't stop laughing when Mr. Keaton tries to apologize to Nick in a ladies' shoe store.
What do the children think when they find out.
I wanted to like Somewhere in the Night and at first was impressed by the off kilter style of the opening in the WWII field hospital with the heavily bandaged amnesia victim played by John Hodiak, but when it switched to its stateside development I soon realized it was derived from several predecessors and didn't really have a clue where to go itself.
He has a partial letter on his person telling him that he's despicable, and when he picks up his belongings, he finds a letter from one Larry Cravat.
Signed to a Fox contract when casting director, Rufus Le Maire, spotted her picture in a 1946 Life magazine lay-out of current college girl dress fashions, Nancy jumped straight from Fox's dramatic school (where she spent "a few months as the star pupil") to the lead feminine role in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's Somewhere in the Night (1946).
Nancy plays it cool, which is a perfect choice, especially when surrounded by consummate scene-stealers like Richard Conte, Lloyd Nolan, John Hodiak and Fritz Kortner.
John Hodiak is good, though perhaps encouraged to overdo the vacant looks even when the amnesia plot seems to have been forgotten.
And when are Corey, Bissell, Morgan and Nolan not welcome?
The only complaint I have is that the film was also low-budget when it came to sound quality, and a lot of the dialogue was hard to decipher.
Now, I don't expect them to know the intricacies of music theory or the ins and outs of the world of classical music, and I understand the dramatic concept of "willful suspension of disbelief," but when a character says (and this is pretty much a verbatim quote), "The New York Philharmonic wants you to play again.
And who doesn't want to believe in happily ever after, especially when you become so emotionally invested?
(Meyers used his mother's maiden name when he became an actor instead of O'Keefe).
In 1959, Russian director Grigory Chukhraj made a film attempting to describe "what happens when the world loses a single person" and it is a masterpiece.
I saw this movie last night when it opened.
It teaches things of the spirit, things unseen, things beyond our human understanding, and it does so through a child who is full of joy when there seems to be no reason for him to have any!
His pediatrician suggested tests when he seemed to her to be intelligent beyond his years.
The script goes beyond belief at almost every turn but when we're talking about the world's greatest young orphan musician being reunited with his parents- who cares?
The movie simply rambles aimlessly from one episode to the next, shamelessly invoking deus ex machina when needed.
After these opening scenes we rejoin the story when August is about twelve.
There is a serious problem with this--such stories advance the "you can be anything you want to be" philosophy without any discussion of how that can frustrate kids when they realize that it's simply not true.
However, when I start hearing 10- year-old uneducated street urchins talking with vocabularies like college professors and saying things that no little kid would say, I get turned off.
Nine months later the baby arrives right when the mother has a car accident.
I met her many years later in New York City when I was in my early twenties.
I'll admit that I'm not the most harsh critique when it comes to comedy.
I hugely enjoyed this series when it was first shown in 1981, even watching the contemporary Sunday repeats which were buried away at 10.30pm on BBC2.
Twenty-two years later (and as many years more seasoned) when I pulled out the tapes to view again of the series I had almost taped over several times, I was overjoyed that I had the miniseries intact.
For example, when the small group was planning a protest the one girl suggested.
"Poster Boy" tries to hard to not be a gay movie; and when you take that away, it really isn't anything else.
For example, when the Noseworthy character admits to his "best friend" that he too, slept with her dead boyfriend, it seems pointless and isn't and doesn't go anywhere, not even to an "I'm sorry for hurting you, Izzy" comment from Noseworthy's Anthony character.
The beginning of the film, where the young man walks away from the Anthony character's bed exists purely to show the character would be petulant because guys walk out on him after sleeping with him -- so when the Henry Kray character does it, of course, he needs revenge by messing up the Henry's entire life.
Enter Anthony, a 28 but younger looking gay man, who's been a member of Act Up but who is now more interested in spending his time with affluent gal pal Izzie and perhaps getting into the pants of some college boy when they crash a campus party.
But when he's a nobody at some second-tier university an they're trying to hide him how is he a Poster Boy living a lie.
Most reviews for this movie are quite negative, and I guess I am in the minority when I say this - but this movie was fantastic!!!
Kaji's performance is stunning(..those moments where we actually see on her face how wrought in agony she is when facing the idea that one of her quarry possibly escapes the slice of her sword while alive, especially)and this is quite an iconic character.
One moment Henry is throwing the suit & tie clad Young Republican into the pool; the next moment he's bonding with him and hiring him a hooker when he learns he's still a virgin.
Years ago when this aired on Baton Rouge's WLPB PBS station it was HEAVILY edited!
After he dies, she marries a businessman, who leaves her when his fortune is depleted.
He sure didn't fight like a SEAL, especially when that woman was kicking his a**!
And that's when "Little Red Riding Hood" turns into "RED HOT RIDING HOOD"!!!
Red escapes Wolf saying she's going to her Grandma's house, but when Wolf arrives Red is nowhere to be found.
This toon was made during the war at a time when noir movies were rising fast.
All these questions would have felt moronic when I was eight and simply enjoyed it as a cartoon.
Working as a projectionist in the cinema I have also shown the toon, and on examining the print it is really noticeable that many frames have been cut out when "Red" makes an appearance.
Besides, is there a context in which this film could be realistically expected to be shown where the audience would be truly surprised when it doesn't turn out to be a straight version of the fairy-tale?
It is difficult when making a film to stay true to the book, and that is why i believe that this version of Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest films ever made.
I picked up Jane Austen's book Pride & Prejudice while in high school and I couldn't make myself get past the first chapter... that and the fact that I don't typically like period dramas (they usually aren't done too well), I was hesitant when a friend casually mentioned that it was good, though long.
But, when you sit and read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, widely considered to be Jane Austen's magnum opus, and savor its miniaturist style, its sharp language, the treatment of even its minor characters as a huge tapestry, there is no other way to create a complete vision of the novel but to do a televised re-working of her novel.
We meet the Bennets right at the beginning when they discuss how Netherfield is to be let at last, and that its owner is none other than an eligible bachelor.
Elizabeth, the second eldest Bennet herself is the one who utters the opening line of Austen's book -- and it's appropriate that she be the one who does so: listen to how she says it, not to when she does or who she does to.
But fate has her meet him again when Jane falls ill after she gets called to spend an evening with Bingley and his sisters.
So when the new movie came out I went to have a look, wondering why the novel's this popular.
I rarely give 9s when voting here and I give this a 10!
Lady Snowblood is hardly introduced to the world and tragedy hits when her mother dies from childbirth.
The central message of the story which I found personally educational is the moment when Elizabeth, having thought herself an excellent judge of human character, while reading Darcy's letter realizes that she has entirely deceived herself with regards to the character of both Wickham and Darcy and that this self deception has resulted from vanity, because Wickham flattered her whereas Darcy insulted her with his "She is tolerable I suppose, though not handsome enough to tempt me."
(in another movie called Fever Pitch)) I love the following scenes:  "You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you";  "and when sanctioned by your excellent parents..." dab dab collapsing sweatily against the doorpost while Lizzie rapidly retreats, finishing his speech to himself "I am sure that my proposals will not fail in being... acceptable";  "the Look" as my wife calls it between Darcy and Elizabeth at Pemberley;  the party at Netherfield where most of the Bennets disgrace themselves;  Lady Catherine 'refuses her consent';  Mr Collins' visit to 'condole' with the Bennets;  "for it has been many months since that I have considered her the most handsome woman of my aquaintance" so there!
It produces the same feelings in me as when Arsenal win the League!  
If you enjoy immersing yourself into the time of Jane Austen for an afternoon, and enjoy the simplicity of way back when, then you would really enjoy this movie.
In order to extend our knowledge of the characters of Darcy(Colin Firth), and Mr Collins(David Bamber), two scenes are added; to demonstrate that Darcy is not just an effete aristocrat but a real man worthy of Elizabeth's love we are shown him indulging in manly pursuits; fencing, and swimming in his private lake (it puzzles me why so many women seem to drool over his wet-shirt scene); and to demonstrate that Mr Collins is an idiotic, narrow- minded prude we are shown him trembling with embarrassment and horror when he happens to come across Lydia (Julia Sawalha) in a state of dishabille.
She is at the piano befriending Darcy's sister, Georgiana (Emilia Fox), when he holds her gaze with a silent declaration of his love and admiration.
There wasn't a moment when I wasn't smiling in this film.
In this day and age when most young directors get their first shot, they make some wannabe post-Tarantino gangsta film.
I had never heard of this before until I saw this on Encore late at night when I was hoping for something to fall to sleep to.
It has those great seventies Kung Fu noises when someone jumps up in the air unlike any human could, as well as noises when someone shoves a sword into the enemy.
And when Johnnie and Samantha danced the Charleston beautifully, I was hooked like a mackerel on joy juice.
There is simple humor, such as the "one lump or two" bit or the way he holds the gun when you takes it from the "henchmen".
While I liked Tarantino's film a lot when it was playing in theaters, I do not think that "Lady Snowblood" needs this attribute, as this one ranks even way higher in my personal appreciation.
Yet it is inevitable to compare the two films when one has seen both, simply because Tarantino copied so many aspects of this one.
Lots of fun when Johnny is called on to save the same damsel in distress (named Virginia, natch) on three different occasions.
The gimmick never got old; just when it seemed in danger of doing so, something new would happen to keep it fresh.
The Marx Brothers ending (no spoiler really), and the short Egyptian tomb sequence show the care that was taken with getting all the 1920's aspects down perfectly (and don't forget the musical numbers, when people would break into song in any sort of film back then -well, the talkies at least).
too funny - don't pass this one by when it shows up next time!
Really at many times the program can seem like a debate style when both the host conservative(Hannity) and liberal(Colmes) ask the guests the questions.
Though many times plenty of guests are conservative like Dick Morris, Ann Coulter and other republicans still the interviews are balanced out when liberal host Alan Colmes ask them the tough questions and he tries to engage them into debate.
The movie which attracted little attention when it was released, now has world wide audience thanks to Tarantino giving it credit as inspiration for Kill Bill.
What bugs me more than anything is the way that Fox News masquerades as news when it's really mainly opinion and commentary with a heavy (clumsy, actually) right-handed spin.
When is it "News Reporting" and when do we have "News & Commentery"?
It's when somebody puts the Why into the story that we have our news "Editorialized", hence slanted, spun or otherwise prostituted for one's political agenda.
Time was when our Elected Officials in Government at all levels left the disagreements on the floors of their respective offices or legislative chambers.
On the right side, Sean Hannity tends to nitpick about whether or not guests literally answer his question in a "yes or no" when he could be talking about the actual issues.
Particularly when conservatives are alleging Democrats are wrong on an issue, Alan seems to go off and talk about how some Republican also supports whatever the issue is.
I do agree the debates a better when someone else is hosting the "Colmes" spot.
Where's Stephen Baldwin when you need him!?!?
The script by Clyde, Frances Doel & Jeffrey Sturges is pretty clichÃ©d & very standard for this type of film, basically there's some form of huge man eating monster/creature running around eating the less important members of the cast & when all said & done that's all there is to Supergator really.
The CGI computer effects are poor, the supergator itself looks OK but it isn't animated that well & every time it attacks someone a fake puppet head & jaws are used & there are close-ups of it's blood stained mouth & teeth yet when the film switches back to the CGI supergator it's mouth & teeth are perfectly clean.
And just when you think they will, Supergator appears out of nowhere and ambushes them.
The notion is totally absurd when the subject of the film is one of the central pillars of the establishment in society - the police force.
You know something is off when the only real sane person around is played by James Woods!
But, of course, they weren't stars when this movie was made -- they were really just breaking into the business, for the most part.
(In fact, I MISS the days when cops were REAL PEOPLE -- and not a bunch of ex-Marine Drill Instructors akin to Robocops (no offense to The Marines -- but you know what I mean, don't you?).
I was 1 year old when this movie came out and I have grown up around cops.
Where do you go when the bars are closed?
The cops in the movie "The Chiorboys" screw up almost ever assignment that their put on but what get's them in trouble is when Lyles, drunk and locked up in a police paddy wagon, goes wacko and blows away a park hustler when he tried to help him.
We get a bunch of stories of cops who are so unstable and unprofessional that they come across worse then any of the criminals in the movie and end up getting the worse of it when their ever called upon to arrest or restrain them.
There's even a very disturbing scene when two of the cops Rules & Proust, Tim Mcintire & Randy Quaid, are on a roof trying to stop a woman from jumping to her death.
I saw this movie when it came out, I was in college.
The low-point of the movie comes when snarling cop Tim McIntire (in a career-ending turn) is hand-cuffed to a tree without his pants and is spotted by a mincing homosexual.
We are supposedly meant to rejoice at the end when all officers involved in the shooting of an innocent gay teenager receive slaps on the wrist.
I remember a scene in the film 'Electra Glide in Blue' when a Vietnam Vet who was a highway patrolman gave a 'perp' who was also a vet advice that he couldn't use his service record as an excuse to drop out and behave badly.
Maybe it was because it came out at the time when punk had just happened.
I was a cop with about 10 years on the street when I read Wambaugh's book, and figured the movie would be terrible.
The only downside to the graphics is the characters who have some really awkward faces and texture animation but hey when the game play and story is so good it doesn't make it much of an issue.
it's also played in the movie for the scene when Sharon gets a peek at Alessa's dark side when the movie begins.
one great improvement over the past games is the creatures who are a lot more messed up in this one and whiles there's no creature that rivals my boy Pyramid Head the creatures should make any normal human being get skid marks in their knickers when they see them coming at them.
I will admit when I first bought it, I was too scared to play it, so I got my friend over and watched him play it.
Granted this makes it a bit more scary I guess, but I hate when the camera pans to the front of you when I need to see what is ahead.
I wasn't bothered by the gender in the least, and her personality isn't irritating(I've yet to come across a single obnoxious person in this franchise up to this point); however, her vocabulary, well, fits her age, and it does take away from the mood when something is called/described using words like "boring", "gross" or "yuck".
It won't work everywhere, still, it will when you have to, as the video-game won't always automatically do so.
this movie is now one of my favourites, up there with the Hellraiser series, Mothman Prophecies, Wishmaster, Carrie, Event Horizon and Jurassic Park  again, it is such a hell of a shame that people are ready to spit on this film, when it does deserve a helluva chance  it is just aces  
On a weekend hunting trip two firefighters Alex Kerwood and Wayne Higley stumble onto a mysterious burial site.They dig it up and find the skull of an ancient horned creature.Big mistake!Suddenly the unleashed monster starts killing people in a small American town...OK,I'm a pretty tolerant guy when it comes to low-budget indie horror,but "In the Woods" is bad to the bone.The script is lifeless and dull,the suspense is non-existent and the action takes place in the woods for only 10 minutes or so.The DVD proudly claims "Creepier than 'The Blair Witch Project'".Yeah,right!Avoid this piece of cow dung like the plague unless you want to be bored beyond comprehension.
Which happens a lot when you watch foreign cinema.
I kept wondering when it would be over.
And prepare for dialogue spewed out by an Automatic Cliche Machine, delivered by actors on par with the cast of your average third-grade play, embarrassing themselves through a "plot" that only makes sense when it's silly.
And when they did go to the woods, these firemen actually want to dig up a grave so that they maybe help the police locate a body?
The dialogue on the back of the firetruck when Alex is upset to learn the baby died.
The plot is about two hunters who go in the woods, dig up a grave, find an animal skull, and run out of the woods when a loud noise scares them.
Perry's character is no innocent, when he first journeys into the forest (he is an alcoholic and an emotionally abusive husband), the viewer gets the sense that he is unaware of the world in which he lives.
This movie claims to be like "Blair Witch Project" (which is not that good of a movie itself) so when I saw it on the shelf I just laughed.
The world was blessed on September 3rd, 1902, when Mantan Moreland was born in Monroe, Louisiana and the world was saddened at our loss when he died September 28, 1973 in Hollywood, California, where he appeared in 134 movies as well his memorable guest appearances on the Bill Cosby Show in 1969 or on "Love, American Style" in 1969, or on the police drama "Adam-12" in 1968.

I loved the bit, for example, when a villain explains to a radical left-wing writer his business of the last few years, exactly in the exaggerated fashion that a radical left-wing reporter would be inclined to write about a tyrannical bureaucrat.
Daffy plays a wanted Robin Hood, who is just prancing singing and playing his instrument, when he slips down a hill falling into a pond.
The only thing original was the ending when Daffy says "Shake hands with Friar Duck."
It is from a time when horror was about more than hi-tech gory special effects and torture sequences thrown together to make a 'body' of work and although this Hammer box-set is of its time it is a brilliant collection that has also stood the test of time.
An unsettling mood pervades this particular episode (helped by its central location, an English country-house situated deep into the woods) Â even if, when finally glimpsed, the werewolf make-up is kind of goofy!
The final twist Â concerning a woodsman Cazenove meets when he goes looking for his missing wife Â is predictable, but nicely handled all the same.
Like many of you, Id never heard the title Lady Snowblood before Kill Bill came out, so when I watched Kill Bill and saw Tarantino mention this film as one of his biggest influences, well I knew I would have to check it out sooner or later.
I wont say Tarantino isn't a genius on his own right the guy is one of my favorites, but when he gets inspired he sure knows where to get his inspiration from!
I mean the level of hatred thats transferred onto Lady Snowblood when she is a child and the horrible things that happen to her spawn one of the most hatred filled characters that I have seen in a long time.
The song adds an incredible emotion to the film, specially when you know what it says.
So when being able to see an Italian movie, or should I call it a mini-series, that deals with all these aspects of Italian life, I knew I had to watch it.
As one who loves movies but who can still acknowledge his limitations when it comes to sitting still for ungodly lengths of times, I really must take my hat off to all those hardy souls who rose to the challenge and went to see this film at their local bijous.
The final scenes of "The Best of Youth" are tremendously moving and exhilarating simply because we feel as if we have truly come to know these people as individuals and will miss them when they're gone.
I was sad when the movie ended, I could watch 6 more hours.
It's hard to make people age 40 years in one movie, I know, so, director, you have my respect for Adriana, because she really ages perfectly, although when you look carefully, you do see she's only in her 30s instead of her 70s... :)
I believe in everybody who loves CINEMA there is a dream, to make a movie in which the story run like the life, in which we could feel like when, children in our bed, waiting to be catch by the sleep, we listen the tales from our parents and everything seems more real than reality.
When I was watching the last part of it, I laughed when they laughed, I had tears in my eyes when they were crying.
Suffice it to say, the story never loses the viewer's interest as proved when we recently watched the two part DVD.
It was one of those nights when I wanted to watch something light for half an hour and then go to bed.
If I see any clue, it lies way back, the day or two with Giorgia, when she, if not he, knew him already a soul broken in some way that her experience had taught her to understand.
U.S. mini-series were more successful as sweeping historical epics, even when they were also family sagas like "Roots" and "Centennial;" when the networks tried to interpret more recent history, as in "The Sixties," the set characters sped through "Zelig" and "Forest Gump"-like in happening to be at the right place at the right time; perhaps the several seasons combined of the NBC series "American Dreams" could be considered comparable in showing how the times that are a-changing affect a family.
It starts when they are both about 18 years old; two young idealist who want to discover and change the world.
Not that the odd decent flick doesn't grace our screens these days; however, when compared to Cinecitta's hey-day between the late 40s and 70s, today's production is scant.
That's when I started to despair for this country's ailing contemporary cultural heritage!
And by the look of the Roman movie theatres heaving with people when I went to see La meglio gioventu' last week, they also agree that Marco Tullio Giordana's last effort is worth the effort of sitting in a cinema for almost 6 hours!
Those that now rent the public airwaves should be jailed for not abiding by the laws they are to adhere to when they use the public airwaves.
I'd heard about Dallaire's return to Canada and what happened when he came back.
I would have been more interested in hearing about Dallaire's psyche when he returned home.
Quite what the reason for both films featuring the same title is anyone's guess: I know that Italian filmmakers were more interested in making money than anything else, but surely releasing two films under the same title would do more harm than good when it came to the box office...but oh well.
The impossibly good-looking Jean Sorel is on hand as the husband/ex-husband, and Sorel can be good when he wants to be, but here he seems cheesed off in just about every scene, resulting in a totally one-note performance (perhaps the many bathing suits he was forced to wear were too tight).
Much of "The Healer" actually centers around the rift that occurs in the life of the Makowskys, a Canadian family whose happiness is torn asunder when the husband--played with superb complexity by William Fichtner--has an affair, and the young son develops cancer.
Their sexual union seems to rob the healer of his ability to help the little boy when his cancer returns.
i especially loved the scenes when they were trying to work a scene.
Why this film or their acting was ignored when this film came out is baffling.
Among other things that Charles II did when he came to the throne was restore the theater.
While I had certainly known there was a time in theater when men played women's parts, I had never before thought about what might have happened to them when women were finally allowed on the stage.
I caught this on City TV last night (Feb 16th, 2008) when flipping through the channels, and even though I had missed the first 30 minutes of this film, I was compelled to stop on that channel and watch it!
I kind of disliked how Alexei abruptly left, when he found he couldn't heal the boy.
Or did he lose his powers when he impregnated Julie?
Also, when the film cuts to the final scene, where Julie's pregnancy is obviously going along nicely, and even though their son's death is imminent, they appear to be a reunited, happy family again.
It truly IS a thought-provoking film and I love when I can watch a film and still be affected by it, and still be thinking about it, days later.
The topic is more or less familiar from "Shakespeare in love": It is the drama of this time when women wanted to act on stage but only men were allowed to do so.
While "Shakespeare in love" showed this drama from a female point of view, "Stage Beauty" deals with a man whose life falls to bits and peaces when a woman plays a woman and achieves a change of law which now allows women to act on stage.
When he is on stage he's incredible and when he's off stage he's simply hot but also convincing when facing the greatest crisis of his life (in his role I mean).
I'm sure it must be hard to make a dramatic comedy that's as funny as it is dramatic, especially when it's a period piece as well, but Stage Beauty pulls it off with flair.
This film is full of quotable lines and exchanges, such as when the King says, "Why shouldn't we have women on stage?
I seem to have missed this when it played in New York, and I don't know how.
:)   As an actress's daughter, I had been curious about when and how did the transition between men-playing-women and women-playing-women.
In an age when women were forbidden to perform on the stage Ned Kynaston was arguably the "prettiest man in London" & the toast of the London's theatrical world.
But when Charles II declares women may indeed trod the theatre's (& London's) stage(s), he finds himself haunted by the persona he has become.
Though she's not past being bewildered by them, especially when her portrait is being painted.
Having never seen a picture by this particular director before, but having enjoyed Miranda Otto's performance in LoTR, I gave this movie a chance when I saw in on the Sundance Channel a year or so ago.
I believe this is a rather excellent movie, when looked at from the right angle.
I think she's one of the most interesting actresses of her generation and here you enjoy her enormously when she's on but her character is now a blurry dot in my memory.
Alone with Maria, we get a glimmer of something else in him when he pauses contemplatively to quote his mentor - "Never forget that you are a man in woman's form...or was it the other way 'round?"
For when Charles II was restored to the throne lost by his father (who also lost something else of even more estimable value), theaters reopened but under an old law that forbade the presence of actresses on the stage.
If you look at the mother in the beginning when she just finds out her son is ill and dying, you can see that she is in no condition to let go, especially because she has no source of comfort with her husband just having cheated on her.
He has sex for the first time, impregnates her, and then it completely makes sense that when her son's illness comes back, Alexai's healing powers are gone.
I saw this when it was released with a double feature of "Together Brothers".
Remember when Johnny Tough's father made him spend the night in Jail?
That's an old saying in Hollywood when a film suddenly ends with no explanation.
I miss the days when we had so many of our films to choose from that showcased a predominantly black cast.
If your jaw doesn't drop when the girls go the bathroom, then you must be a psychic.
Not sure when or if ever it will be on DVD, but it's a keeper.
All three have abilities and a special unit(which is cloaked, but can be detected, when using abilities or if the enemy has a unit that uncloaks their enemies) that fit their profile... GLA has a sniper, who(in addition to sniping infantry) can kill the driver of any enemy vehicle, the Chinese have an unarmed agent who, using her lap-top, can steal from the enemies and disable their vehicles one at a time, and the US have a battle-hardened colonel, equipped with a knife, explosives and a machine-gun(essentially a Commando/Tanya, but oh well, those *are* pretty rockin').
The air-borne combat is made more open, particularly when playing as the US, which has access to three different types of planes, a transport helicopter and an attack chopper(and that's in addition to the special abilities).
First, when he is thrown off the boat by Donald Crisp and toward the climatic end when he lays down, humming the tune, and finds Crisp's cane.
If you missed it when it aired in February, catch it when it's on again...don't forget to bring a box of tissues!
Upon his release from the hospital, Declan decides he would like to stay at their widowed grandmother's house in the Irish countryside, where he and his sister stayed for some time when their mother went away to care for their father who was dying of cancer, when they were both children.
I knew nothing about this film when I watched it on Sundance Channel the other day.
I agree with someone who said that his passions must have been diverted away from healing when he set them on Julie instead, and I was not surprised when this happened.
only booms out of the movie when something REALLY exciting is happening (which is twice).
The painful memory of watching this movie when it was released 20 years ago lingers, like herpes.
The only good thing about this movie are the unintentional howlers, such as the bad guys who live in the desert, and wear full-length fur coats (hmmmm, maybe not the best thing to wear when it is 120 degrees out).
Best of all when Yor is fighting we are treated to a kicking rock soundtrack that sounds like a bad rip-off of Queens Flash Gordon soundtrack.
This film ended up reminding me of those old-fashioned monster movies I used to watch on local access TV stations when I was about five years old.
Finally, the film does an about face from caveman fantasy to sci-fi when our heroes encounter a galactic warlord type who lives in secret on an island.
What would you do, when suddenly Darth-Vader comes around the corner in an "Cavemen-Movie" ?
Ms. Holland's film is complicated, in that it asks the viewer to think about how Julie's actions to save Nick, her young son, stricken with a rare cancer, clash with the medical science because she goes with her instincts instead, when she takes the boy to be seen by a folk "healer" in Poland.
At the same time her marriage has come to an abrupt end when she learns her husband has betrayed her with another woman, in her own home.
Julie sees an improvement when "the healer" selects Nick as his next project to help and asks her to follow him as he goes through the countryside seeing people.
Something is not quite right with Nick and when he has a relapse, Julie's faith in Alexei's ability to cure her son evaporates, thus ending their relationship, as Alexei abandons Julie.
At the end, when Alexei has left, we finally see some sense of harmony in Julie's life, depicted lovingly in the last sequence of the film.
when the villain Overlord calls Yor's girlfriend "the fresh rose of fertility", Yor proudly, but flatly states "You can't have her, Overlord.
The real laugh comes from realizing that someone took the project serious when they shot it!
Both the above scenes are made immeasurably more enjoyable when the dramatic opening of the main title song suddenly blurts out during the crucial moments!
Cave bimbo Kalaa's constant assertion that "Yor's not like other men" when in fact he looks just like every other South Beach surfer dude who's ever gotten lost in a desert wasteland.
Just when you're praying it won't get any more surreal, just when you've thrown up your hands and surrendered your sanity, Darth Vader shows up.
It brings back memories of childhood from when my parents took me to see Dinosaurs Alive at the zoo.
It also was the only movie starting when we arrived, to be truthful.
Yor is great when there is nothing to watch and along comes YOR you can easily stop clicking channels you have been saved .You can watch Yor in any mood and it fits .There is only one catch you can not tell your friends you watched it by your self.You can watch it and drive someone else in the room crazy.I just wish it was a series there is so much more he could do .
Stunts like Yor falling off the cliff is amazing I can not tell how they pulled it off.Some how I just knew when he killed the Great flying moth he was going to use it to swoop in on the Hairy Monster men .I don't know how he easily overcame the leader when he was wearing Yors strenght necklace.
Having watched it a couple of times (incredulously on both occasions) we have coined the term to "Yor" when playing games, meaning to destroy or eradicate (by accident) a town or village.
It helps that the extra, played by Won Hie Lim, is great at the part because there's no real sense of humor to him, but he still ends up being funny, like when he dances to that song from one of the Director's films.
Here, a young woman is tormented by dreams of the twin sister who perished in a fire when they both were circus performers (and her father seemed to prefer the dead sister).
The fact that her editor looks like the father who died in the fire when she was a girl doesn't help in clarifying anything, and the story's own ambiguity lends light into its own world.
Did something horrific happen to her when she was a child?
Cut - 6.5/10 - I expected the most from this one being that its by good ole Chan Park, and I was really excited when the film starts and we see a grand set with one of the spookiest looking characters I've seen in awhile.
Id just seen Sympathy For Lady Vengeance, and Oldboy always weighs heavily on my mind when reviewing psycho-horror dramas.
I wish they'd still shown this type of thing when I was in Driver's Ed.
I'm always very cautious when people refer to the genuine brilliance of Asian horror productions (as I've been let down one too many times), but in the case of "ThreeÂExtremes" every single word of praise is more than justified!
The music is downright nightmarish and particularly the chewing-noises, made when Mrs. Lee eats the dumplings, sent cold shivers down my spine.
Chan-Wook Park is a genius when it comes to the drawing of his characters and he once more demonstrates that here, with his story about the home jacking of a famous director and his vain wife by a severely frustrated walk-on actor.
Staring Kyoko Hasegawa as struggling writer Kyoko, the story mostly focuses on the flashbacks of her childhood when she ran a sideshow act with her sister and father.
How much of what Kyoko envisions is dream, and how much is reality... 7 out of 10   DUMPLINGS (Fruit Chan) - centers around a woman who uses a sickening "special ingredient" for her dumplings, which causes age-reversing effects in those that eat them... 8.5 out of 10   CUT (Park Chan-Wook) - A film director who apparently lives the "ideal" life, is thrown into a hellish nightmare when he is confronted by one of his previous employees... 8.5 out of 10  I enjoyed THREE...EXTREMES for the most part.
Box is about a woman haunted by dreams of her younger sister who died when she was a child, in an accident that she seems to have caused, but is it just a dream?
Harry was about to break the case wide open when he got former militant Black Panther leader and now Man of Peace Big Ed Mustapha, Albert Popwell, to finger the terrorist group leader and where he and his gang of terrorists can be found.
Harry who at first had little respect for his new partner woman cop Kate Moore later was almost in tears when she was gunned down saving his life, for the second time in the movie, by taking a bullet that was meant for him.
Personally I've seen it numerous times but I guess when you love something as much as I love Clint and his works you're probably stuck with it.
Of course Harry says it when he wants to be sarcastic and I really mean it.
Other one is the scene where Harry puts an end to an armed shop robbery and a hostage situation by driving a police car inside the store (very unusual police work and a crazy stunt you can only expect from Callahan) and the other one's when Harry blows away a tower in Alcatraz with a rocket launcher.
Harry gets into one of his usual predicaments when his is relegated to Personnel to help interview patrol officers on the list to make inspector.
I liked it more when he tells his superior about his "mouthwash ain't making it!"
Writer/director Richard Casey here in this case completely failed to put the two genres in the blender together and what came out is an embarrassing amateur horror production with retarded jokes and over-the-top clichÃ©d situations that aren't the least bit funny or inventive; not even when you're in a slight state of drunk or stoned.
She finally does really cover his back later on, but I won't say how or when (no spoiling!).
Harry Callahan is not exactly delighted when his superiors assign him a new partner who happens to be female.
Inspector Kate Moore (Tyne Daly) has chance to impress her legendary new partner when an extremist organization begins to terrorize San Francisco... Storywise, this is not the most interesting film in the series.
But when his partner, Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum) goes down on the job during the robbery of a munitions warehouse, Harry is back on the street, but with a new partner, Kate Moore (Daly), one of the first female inspectors in the country.
But they had better think again; because when they took down Frank, they inadvertently provoked the ire of Inspector Callahan himself, who does not take kindly to their sort to begin with.
Most importantly, that is not the focus of the filmmakers here, and the fact that Moore is a woman is little more in the overall scheme of things than a footnote in cinematic history; Moore is just another character in the `Dirty Harry' saga, and she's a good one (especially when compared to Harry's partner, Al Quan-- played by Evan C. Kim-- in `The Dead Pool').
But when a robbery occurs of an armory and some heavy duty weapons are stolen, the SFPD has to turn to Dirty Harry.
Callahan finds black militants are not his enemies but his allies: when 'Big' Ed Mustapha (Albert Popwell), the black leader, is arrested to boost the Mayor's prestige, Harry actually resigns this time and continues his pursuit of the revolutionaries as a lonerÂ His female aide risks her own job to he1p him and eventually they chase a prime suspect through the seamy 'massage parlor' underworld of the city and kill a leading gang member, who has disguised, herself as a nunÂ And discovering that the Mayor is being held captive on Alcatraz Island, they make for an abandoned fortress for the final shootoutÂ   The film is a step backwards in style and content from the previous twoÂ Harry seems to have reverted to his first incarnation: 'What kind of a department are we running when we're more concerned with the rights of the criminals than of the people we're supposed to be protecting?'
Back when we had morals in society, a man & a woman alone on an island for 7 years that were not married to each other was a big scandal.
It is 1) unrealistic that Irene Dunn, missing at sea for seven years, should reappear on the very day that husband, Cary Grant, has succeeded in having her declared dead and then, moments later, remarried in the same courtroom and 2) that Grant's mother would not have attended the wedding; presumably the writers needed Dunne's mother-in-law to be in when Dunne (who naturally would not have known about the new wedding so would have no reason to attend and try to stop it) resurfaced though a little thought could have solved this.
Everything from the opening credits listing the make-up and stunt people before the writer and not the director, to the final shot when Richard Nixon and Allan Ginsberg form an unlikely duo in a last-ditch attempt to completely ruin sense.
Halfway through the movie he discovers that Dunne was not alone when she was rescued from the island.
In My Favorite Wife,a stand out scene was when Grant 1st sees Scott on the diving board.
Movie moves into high gear when Nick (Cary Grant) sees his first wife as the elevator door closes in the hotel on the way to the honeymoon suite with his bride and he's on the spot to break it to his new bride but then finds out his wife was stranded with a hunk of an anthropologist (Randalf Scott).
Further complications ensue when it's disclosed that Ellen was not alone on the island and that her companion was an athletic Adonis named Stephen Burkett, of course a bachelor.
The ending is obvious from the beginning, but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way, in particular, when Ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate Stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real Stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool.
However, when Grant finds out she was stranded along with the handsome Randolph Scott (FYI--he really was Cary Grant's best friend in real life), Cary isn't sure whether to get remarried or return to Dunn!
The one failing of both these films however is the character of Bianca, she is such a tragic figure when you think about it, she's neither nasty, vulgar, cruel, malicious or evil.
I hate to say anything bad about a film like this, but when there are so many similar films and I have seen a lot of them, it's easily to make comparisons and nit-pick.
The plot can only thicken when Nick finds out that Ellen wasn't alone on that island for 7 years, but she had company in the shape of a very athletic (and very single!)
Here it uses the well known fact that Cary Grant and Randolph Scott lived together for a number of years when Grant was between marriages as "bachelors."
Adding to the mix are the two children Ellen left behind when they were still infants.
Cary Grant was a master of this type of comedy, and the film's screenwriter and producer is Leo McCarey, who began his career making Laurel and Hardy shorts (when McCarey directed the Marx Brothers in Duck Soup, he took the title from a 1927 L & H short; Groucho considered him the only first-class director the Brothers ever had).
He is perfect as the husband who's life is out-of-control when his wife returns the same day he's had her declared dead.
Things get worse and worse when they get deeper and deeper into trouble when more facts slowly surface.
Cary Grant's comedic flair shines as always, even when he's mugging for Garson Kanin (a director who should have stuck to writing).
But, as usual with her movies, it is Irene Dunne who makes this almost unwatchable, particularly in close-ups, when her ever-visible tongue threatens to flop out of her usually open mouth.
Dunne is very funny, posing as a southern friend when she meets Bianca, and also is quite touching when she first sees her children.
And poor Bianca comes off like a villain when she's a victim.
Although his role doesn't permit him to display the jaw-dropping physical prowess that was showcased so remarkably in THE AWFUL TRUTH, Grant's mastery of internal comedy is given ample screen time here - especially in the final two-third when he discovers he may have a romantic rival.
The resulting complications are the stuff of a classic screwball farce and when the husband is Cary Grant and the wife is Irene Dunne and the writers are Sam and Bella Spewack you know you have a winner on your hands.
Another factor comes into play when Grant learns that Dunne spent several years on the desert island with hunky Randolph Scott.
Cary Grant gets himself into an unwitting romantic pickle when he's confronted by his thought to be long dead wife on his honeymoon with his new bride.
Cary Grant's facial expression on the elevator when he first sees Dunne after 7 years is so memorable that I can still remember it 35 years after first seeing it.
Remarkable to think that Ms. Dunne was over forty when this was made.
Film is missing the enticing depths of real-life when it opts for the conformist teenage boy's supposed 'dream woman' - mass-media-fostered - over a greater variety of people and appearances, as one encounters in actual reality.
The insidious wryness seems completely blunted by the end, when the couple are finally reconciled.
Earlier in the flick, when Mike Mazurki starts to stumble through the "You're Not Here" bit, Lou's timing pulls the routine through.
The tasks goes awry when they inadvertently lose it.
The real gem of this feature is a terrific scene near the end, as Abbott and Costello engage in an endless array of crazy conversations, and it's one of the best things they ever did that managed to get captured on film: the boys are eating dinner at a fancy restaurant in an effort to run up a huge bill to get deliberately arrested when they cannot pay the check... all the while they're tangled up in a delicious diatribe where Abbott rants about the values of "Mustard", going into the "Ball Park," having a "Headache," asking Costello how he could "Marry a 10 Year Old Girl", and more!
Not part of the Universal package when their films were syndicated to television, "Noose" has fallen through the cracks and is one of their least familiar films to moviewatchers.
He started this around 1967 and when the Cabaret finally was forced to close its doors (as many "supper theaters" did) in 1989, many of those children, then in their late teens or early twenties, came to the mike and said it had given them the confidence to get into shows.
It doesn't always get a yearly playing, but it is definitely worth keeping your eye out when scanning your TV guide around Christmas.
I wonder why they bother when surely everybody by now knows that anything with a decent rating and a low number of votes must just be being pimped by the people who made it.
I commend Gareth Evans for this film, I don't quite understand what the previous comment meant when they said it was amateurish, for me this is one of the best films to be shot on DV.
He comes from a broken home - his mother died when he was young, and his father married a much younger woman - and has next to no emotional connection with his long-suffering girlfriend, Sera, who leaves him because he just won't talk to her.
The final straw comes at almost exactly the same time, when he is made redundant only days after his dad has died.
I'm pretty cynical when it comes to independent features emerging from Wales,made by welsh film makers.
The editor was probably very high when working on the final print.
In the early to mid 90s horror wasn't exactly dead, but it was a time when our beloved genre wasn't as big a thing as it was in times such as the 40s and 60s-80s.
Because when the day is done that is why you watch this movie.
I love Rob Zombie's music and was looking forward to this movie when I first heard about it.
The scene is set when a carload of grating college students (including former "Singled Out" host Chris Hardwick and "The Office"'s Rainn Wilson), writing a book on weird roadside attractions, run afoul of Captain Spaulding (Sid HaigÂ"Spider Baby"), the flour-faced clown proprietor of a combination gas station/fried chicken stand/Murder Ride.
And why do we spend most of the movie with the grating Fireflies when the Dr. Satan thread would have made a far more interesting film?
I have to admit that when I was sitting down to watch this last night, I was skeptical.
I was caught off guard when I viewed this movie for the first time, and was genuinely shocked and scared in some scenes.
But when you consider the fact that the forerunner is up against such twisted beasts as Blood Harvest, Don't Open 'til Christmas, Pieces, Bloodbeat and the almost extra terrestrial A Day of Judgement, then you begin to realise how tough a challenge it really is.
It may also be the real truth behind Mike and Louise's cool attitude when they find a disembowelled cat mysteriously dumped in the back of their van.
One thing that happened was just to ridiculous, there were 5 local cheerleaders that went missing that keep getting mentioned in the movie, and when one is discovered in the trunk of a car, dead, with the words "trick or treat" carved into her, they send 2 cops to check things out.
People who give this movie a low rating do not appreciate true horror, and therefore should not be taken into consideration when evaluating whether or not to watch this movie.
It leaves out nothing when it comes to messed up killings, Rob Zombie somehow thinks of it all.
You don't have to be a Rob Zombie fan to like this movie, anyone I have ever watched this with has been horrified (to say the least) and that is what most people are looking for when turning to a truly scary movie for entertainment.
It is a movie that will stay with you, and will stand out in your mind when comparing it to the rest of the new millennium horror films.
House of 1000 Corpses somehow manages even to mess up when it comes to plot structure, something even the lowest of horror movies can usually pull off.
Hell, I might even be fooled into renting this again years from now when I completely forget about it.
Four twenty somethings are riding along the back southern roads when they come across a roadside carnival run by an eccentric clown named Captain Spaulding.
To do so, he needs to beat Le Chiffre at baccarat, and not lose his head in the process when his old flame Valerie Mathis (Linda Christian) is threatened with death.
There are also some funny bits, such as when Leiter manages to keep money away from one of Le Chiffre's henchmen.
But when they slag others' professional judgments on the basis of little knowledge of either cinema or the world, they should be kept to oneself.
I is usually a bad sign when, 20 minutes into a film, still nothing has happened, and the information conveyed would easily fit into less than a minute.
Love is the perfect memory that clings to your heart when the world is brought to its knees, and life refuses to surrender.
Fast forward to the present, where some college students are getting together at a cabin in the woods to hang out, and all hell breaks loose when Josie falls in love with Matt (Palillo) when her REAL job is to lure folks into Hellgate so her dad can kill them.
Now Josie's dad, who has a nasty cheek scar from being bitten by a reanimated turtle brought to life by some crystal that shoots blue rays, has a large picture of Josie on the wall of his office that looks like some sexy 80's model picture, and when you see this keep in mind Josie has been dead since the 50's, ??
Tomorrow when I look out the window, walk down the street, have a cup of coffee.
With a woman at the helm, this film becomes a people film, but a man would have strayed, taken more interest in guns and corpses and explosions (little boys going bang bang sometimes never grow up, especially when they have a budget and a cameraman handed to them).
this movie is about the people and how they feel and cope when something momentous happens.
The one fault i'd say is that the passage of time is not particularly well expressed particularly right at the end of the film when what seems to be a present day Ewan is wearing the exact same outfit as in the next scene which must be set sometime after.
The scene where the fish grows and bursts out of its tank, and when the tortoise becomes a monster are cool.
As fate would have it, they are locked in a lovers embrace, with the football match raging on behind them on TV, when the stadium going up in flames with a series of explosions.
She understandably loses it along the way as the story becomes soÂ over-dramatisedÂ that it is justÂ ridiculous (especially when you run the story back in your head afterwards).
As most of us know, symbolism is best when subtle and stripped down.
I find it hard to believe that this ill conceived script ever made it past treatment stage, particularly when so many established UK film companies like CH4 were involved in its development and finance.
If you are old enough to remember Ida Lupino and Dane Clark when they were both at the top of their careers in the 1940's, then this film will be a great Classic to view and enjoy.
If one should doubt it, take one look at "Deep Valley", which was filmed when she was about 32 years old.
I have no idea why Lucus carries a grudge against all outsiders when three punk bikers were the ones solely responsible for the death of his girl.
Petrea Curran(..as Pam, Palillo's love interest)always begrudging her boyfriend when he talks about Josie, pouting but nevertheless returning to his side.
Slow motion assault sequences(..even when they are not required).
And, last but not least, Palillo's Matt, despite what he had previously seen when alone in Lucus' ghost town, decides to convince his pals to return there.
How do movies like this get so lost when mediocrities abound?
Only later, when a young policeman (Redford) is shot does she struggle between her fears and her desire to aid this poor dying man.
After all, gay audiences probably won't enjoy all the religious content and Bible verses--especially when the people of Sodom are damned.
The most surprising image is when the men approach Lot's door and one man has his arm bent upwards and his hand cupped.
(Interestingly, apart from the actual Genesis account, a phrase from the Song of Songs is also used when Lot is offering his daughters to the mob outside, desperately trying to convince them of the attractions of 'woman').
She didn't return to a television series until the late 1980's/early 1990's when she started appearing on the prime time soap Dynast.
But I remembered this show when they came out recently with the new "Nurse" shows--Nurse Jackie and HawthoRNe.
But I remembered this show that I watched when I was all of 5 years old.
I cried when Obama won the election, because I felt like it was a win for MY side.
I hated this show when I was younger, but to see it now it is so cute and many situations come to light and are dealt with in a fun and dignified manner.
A very earthy mother-like feeling comes from to mind when I watch her.
The series did very well in its timeslot when it premiered in 1968,opposite the espionage series "It Takes A Thief"(which was on ABC),and the long-running variety series "The Red Skelton Show"(which was on CBS).
However,the show was the first to tackle issues head on for its day and it was handled with style and grace..something that was unheard of and especially when this show premiered in 1968.
Things turn deadly when a prostitute is attacked and Bell discovers a room covered in blood,but which contains no body.Soon Bell and Doyle are in a race against time to stop madman Thomas Neill(Alec Newman)from going on a killing spree.Neill was in real life a fellow student of Doyle's and a suspect in the Jack The Ripper case.
Second, and this is true, the real-life Bell served as the inspiration for Conan Doyle's great creation when Doyle gave up medicine for writing...Sherlock Holmes, of course.
This film could be a real gem if it would not be a fake; it is largely sustained by the great performance of the 2 actors, also there is a pleasant and fortunate choice of characters around them, the screen play has wonderful passages but ... the whole is incredibly wasted under a ton of moralistic non sense mainly anti sexual: the lovers go around spending their passion in thousands of kisses but never are able to complete it with what you are expecting they must do; instead here is the punishment; after the last stupid, unbelievable and meaningless misunderstanding the girl run away and is knocked down by a car; he visits her at the hospital all seems OK but when he comes again the doctor says she is dead; what do you expect him to do, perhaps bursting into tears?
The movie begins in a pretty strange way, particularly when we consider the year it was made in.
wonders the girl and the boy takes everything so seriously...  Another aspect of the movie is the title melody, a song that Monpti once puts on when Anne Claire visits him.
MONPTI is a nice underrated film about simplicity, youthful joy, pure affection that all young people may get through when they only want to.
It is a widespread superstition that when a book is filmed, the movie is usually inferior to the book.
I was 53 when I saw 'Monpti' for the first time.
I met Juan and Virginia Chacon when I was organizing steelworkers in the southwest.
Although everything I know about this era comes from reading about it, nonetheless One of the Hollywood Ten seems to accurately depict a darker side of our history during the Cold War years when Communism was a threat to our country.
It was possible to identify with the tragedy of those who were jailed and feel joy when they found a way of escaping from their victimization.
Herbert is in for one the biggest surprises of his life later in the movie when his friend and fellow Hollywood Ten, and fellow prisoner, film director Edward Dmytryk, Sean Chapman, became a friendly witness to the HUAC Committee and ratted out six fellow travelers, members or former members of the Communist party, with him being one of them.This just about sealed Herbert's coffin with no way from him to redeemed himself from his past activities and being branded a "Dirty Commie Rat" for the rest of his life.
They would hold guns to our heads, ask us our religion, and when we answered "Catholic" (like we were all going to be real anxious to do that), we'd be shot.
Crum advised them all to tell the truth at the hearings -- that when asked if they were now or had been a member of the Communist party, to disarm the committee by answering truthfully.
It is set during the cold war when the government was seeing reds under everyones bed.
In any event, there should be more movies with actors of this caliber, especially nowadays when the world could really use a great "G" rated film without all the animation and special effects.
A nine year old Brooklyn boy nicknamed "Ceddie" (Freddie Bartholomew), beloved by all who know him due to his kindly nature, finds himself in for a most unexpected change of lifestyle when he learns he's to be heir to the estate of his grandfather (C. Aubrey Smith), a British Earl and has to move in with him.
Dolores Costello too was nicely cast and delivers the goods when she's called upon to do so.
Joe strikes when the getting's good, knocks out Paola and starts chipping away at the fireplace with a pick axe.
This, coupled with the fact that Dallesandro has a talent for showing good expression with his eyes, and Di Leo never fails to include one of these shots when necessary to make up for other qualities lacking, makes the film succeed when, in another director's hands, it could have faltered due to a lack of directorial understanding of his actor.
it's shot on video which is always a bad thing, the acting is bad - especially when the actors try speaking English.
Three teens are sitting around in a cabin telling spooky stories when one tells the back-story of the Hellgate hitch-hiker, a girl, living in the '50's whom a motorcycle gang kidnaps and kills.
I didn't know quite what to expect about this film, but when i saw it on television i was hooked from the beginning.
Directed by Jim Wynorski, whose very name when attached to a film sends shivers down my spine, 976-EVIL 2: The Astral Factor is a terrible sequel to a fairly decent original.
Director Wynorski still had the nerve to use his real name on the credits when he made this back in '91 instead of hiding under his usual Jay Andrews pseudonym, the film is reasonably well made but it doesn't have any style or the visual look of the first film.
There was a time when horror films were gritty, exploitive, funny, nasty, and had moments so bad they were good.
The main characters are four women who entered the working world with hopes of making a life for themselves that would set them apart from the rest of the rat race, but had their dreams dashed when they realized that in today's crowded job market they had to take what they could get.
But things change when they go one step to far and get caught in the act.
Peter Cushing's determined Dr. Knox whose all too blinded by his work to see the wrong in his ways, but this honour takes a huge bump when it takes a child to knock him off his perch.
Pleasence, though who did play Rose's character like a puppet, really gets your skin crawling, especially with his sly nature, body movement and reactions to when performing these callous acts.
But please, when watching this movie, don't expect a movie with walking death people or Cushing in a role of a 'Frankenstein' like professor.
In "Flesh" there's a positive outlook for Knox who comes to the understanding of what he was doing wrong because he had abandoned any emotion when it came to accepting any corpse those two brought him only thinking about science and leaving away the conscience.
Until, after the trial of Burke and Hare, he stoops down in a city square when a tattered little girl asks him for alms.
She overacts much of the time but, when reined in by her instincts or the director, she delivers some thoughtful lines.
Imagine Chris' surprise when she shows up on the slab in class the next day.
Dr. Knox's condescending attitude towards his fellow colleagues also provides a number of entertaining confrontation scenes (my favorite line is during their face-off at his house, when he brusquely terminates the discussion by instructing them to "incline their heads slightly to the left...{in order to} observe the door...{and could they} please use it!
"); Cushing, of course, is equally commanding while addressing his lectures or when scrutinizing the newest corpse.
Unfortunately, the liner notes by Jonathan Sothcott were not available with my copy: it's probable that the disc was initially released as a snapper-case (with the essay on the inner sleeve) but was then dropped when re-issued in the more manageable keep-case!
I guess I am not standing alone when i declare Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasence two of my favorite actors.
From what I've read in factual biographies and works of reference (yes, I find this stuff so intriguing that I study it on the side), the screenplay is rather accurate and faithful when it comes to the basic re-telling of the murder cases.
It was a bad ship, and it ended in a one-way ticket back to Sweden, paid by the Swedish embassy, but, however, there were some Mexican hookers visiting our ship every day during our stay, very friendly and "speakable", but one day when they came aboard one of them shouted "I'm a movie star", and she explained that she had a part in a film called "Crossroads" (later I found out that it was called Back Roads), featuring Sally Field.
14th March 2007, when they showed it on cable television...fantastic!
She's proving nothing to no one--it's second-nature to her--and when Keith calls her a 'whore' she tells him, "A whore is a sixteen-year-old with a bad reputation.
Do the actors get paid when they make something like this?
Best scene was when of the little guys was at the beach with his jet ski and a babe shows up wearing a thong bathing suit and leather high heeled boots that went up to her crotch.
Not an execrable film by any stretch, but something's clearly not right when it doesn't work even with all the abundant female flesh on view.
What I cannot understand is that by 1984 when this film was made (it was so bad it was quietly released three years later), why did NL not give this film to a reliable director such as Harold Ramis, John Landis, Amy Heckerling, or John Hughes?
However, when Beverly made those crank calls to Dottie, I laughed absolutely hysterically.
Watch this one when you want to turn off your brain for a couple of hours and just have fun.
He's nowhere near as creative as the Coen brothers and not as uproariously funny as the Farrelly brothers, but we're almost in a state of awe watching the movie, smiling, but wondering if we should be when an overly-sweet, caring mother beats a woman to death with a leg of lamb.
It's like when you've just watched a gag in extremely poor taste done pleasantly with such giddy amusement that you just shake your head and say, "That is just wrong!"
Lake, the daughter in search of a boyfriend, is the first to suspect her mother's dark side and Lillard, the son with a love for classic gore horror movies, is interested when he's told his mother may be a killer.
Ever have that day when someone gets on your nerves and you feel like pulling the axe on them?That's exactly what John Waters demonstates in his dark comedy Serial Mom.After starring in the cheesy family movie "House of Cards", Kathleen Turner has created one of the best performances in her life as the beautiful, heroic, misunderstood, law-obeying serial killer Beverly Sutphin.Eversince six murders, she has been placed with some "terribly untrue charges" and the only 'serial' she knows "anything about is Rice Krispies!
".But she has good reason for butchering six people: they all commited a crime that no one understands, like dumping her daughter, eating poultry (because Beverly loves birds),smart-alacing about her dentist husband, refusing to rewind a rental tape, critisizing about her family skills, and witnessing one of the other five crimes.You may think she's insane, but really, she's just expressing things we'd rather hide inside of us.Like, say you work in a store and someone wants to return something but they don't have the recipt.It can't be returned without the recipt, so you tell them "No can do".Then they start cursing you out like you're worthless.Wouldn't you get the urge to shove a bullet in their brain?Well then, you now know how Beverly Sutphin feels when someone decides to be a wise guy.This movie is perfect for anyone who loves to laugh.Plus, the DVD contains the theatrical trailer, a behind-the-scenes featurette, several TV spots, four interview clips, and extra behind the scenes footage.I give this one a 10/10!
This is one crazy house wife that you don't want to be a rude kid or adult because she will find you and hunt you down till you are dead.Man this was the best movie that I have seen that is based on true events that is horror that I know and love.This b****Y mom was finally on the louse and insane to kill people that are rude,dressed badly,and anyone that messes with her family,any jokes.And when she went to court was really when she became wild and made each eyewitness into trouble.She is using facts about them and her body to make them crack.And very funny when the judge was flirting with Suzanne Somers when she came in the Court.And lastly,great ending when she kill a woman for wearing   white after Labor Day.And that jury woman taught she was innocent right from the beginning,can you believe this damn woman.And she kills when she was just set free and kill,very stupid thing to do and stupider was the jury setting her free.Now she will continue her work,make a part two Mr.
On the other hand, when black comedy succeeds, the result can be superb.
He places words in right situations as it was a breeze; he puts some black humor when it gets too serious and just a little bit of scare and creepiness when it gets too kitschy.
Ever momentarily had an urge to kill someone when they stole a parking spot from you, badmouthed a member of your family, or committed an obvious fashion violation?
Turner is best in the moments when she goes from a harmless Donna Reed to Charles Manson within seconds when someone makes the mistake of annoying her- just watch her face.
Maybe, a little too respectable so that when someone speaks ill of one member of her family, Beverly is ready to kill to defend her family!
Still, there are a few good moments, such as when King Sunny Ade and his African Beats are playing, and also when they show any exterior shot (the movie was filmed around Mesa and Phoenix, AZ).
when I think of this movie.
That's the point when the picture shifts gears and we start seeing the "action/adventure" film which is quite well done.
apart from that i believe its a very good movie the best part of it,has to be the atmosphere created,especially in the beginning   when the movie ended i had the same feeling i had with "bone collector" and "takin lives" (i adored both of them) i really think "the empire of the wolves" has the standards to compete with these two great movies  the political edge though makes the latter stand out in my opinion.
Oh and that scene where Lucy turns into a slo mo pouting model when the man starts taking her photograph !
Rachael Leigh Cook in my eyes doesn`t look a day over 14 so when Lucy starts discussing modeling in her underwear , or keeps giving a sultry look or that horse riding sequence I couldn`t help but give an audible " YUCK "
Ah, the good accent of foreign guys when speaking Italian: Hopkins was ridiculous when reciting in Latin-Italian in Hannibal.
From the beginning it can't seem to find what it really wants to do, which is unfortunate because it's a kind of interesting premise...but only 'kind of', which dooms it from the outset when coupled with its lacking script and subpar acting.
Here's the longer version: Some of the acting is so bad it's more frightening than the horror plot (a Satanic church wants the Antichrist back and all they need is a demon clock saying when they should sacrifice 18 angelic children).
You'll clap your hand when the titles get there: not because the movie was good, but because it's finally over.
due to commercial interruption when I usually change the station.
mayhap I will record it when next I find it playing.
Things change when basketball superstar Joe Campbell is accused of rape with violence.
Things get bad when Campbell decides to take revenge on Ringel by seducing Ringel's sweet but hot daughter Emma.
I first saw Mariska's work when she was a kid on "Falcon Crest" and my opinion of her has never changed.
Abe Ringel (Ken Olin) is retained by jock star Joe Campbell (Holt McCallany) when a young woman accuses him of raping her.
It's not until he decides to concentrate on Emma, Ringel's daughter, when everything comes to a head.
of State are killed when a building collapses, and the Vice President had had a stroke a month earlier, so the Oval office falls to a token black staffmember (played by James Earl Jones).
Isn't that what all those Nazis claimed when asked how they could commit so many atrocities?
During the war, Deever was put on trial and found guilty of shipping cylinders from the factory that he knew were defective, which, when put into planes, caused the deaths of many war pilots.
Robinson was a magnificent actor but is so obviously guilty, one wonders how he escaped prosecution, especially when one sees the sincerity of Herbert Deever when Chris visits him in prison.
Problems in combat situations would be investigated, but most training accidents were assumed to be pilot error even when they patently weren't.
Eddie Robinson is great as, "Joe", a man who sees himself as a total success in business, family, and in service to his country when he provided parts for the cause during wartime.
Joe has a nice family he is very proud of and works hard to give them all the comforts he never had when he was a child growing up.
All of the cast principles and minor players as well were at the top of their forms when they stood before the cameras.
Yet when they appeared in this film, they succeeded in doing what I think a film of a major stage work should do.
In SALESMAN it is Willy Loman's gradual realization that a lifetime of hard struggle and strife serving his company did not result in his being shown any respect when he can no longer bring in any large business.
So when Miller did this film it was, if you will, "virgin territory".
Seems that during WWII, he and his partner (FRANK CONROY) were pressured to finish making cylinder parts for airplanes on the government's tight schedule and knowingly sent defective parts which caused the death of twenty-one pilots when their planes went down.
Conflicts arise when others around him begin to question his role in the crime that sent his partner to jail.
The son of the jailed partner, played in rather stiff fashion by HOWARD DUFF, is unforgiving when he realizes Robinson shared the guilt with his father and yet let his father take the blame for the incident.
Lancaster, too, and his girlfriend (LOUISA HORTON) who happens to be Duff's sister, also bring the conflicts into the open when they start asking for answers and probing for the truth.
Trivia note: The only implausible factor in the casting--the physical impossibility of BURT LANCASTER as Robinson's son, when he bears no physical resemblance whatsoever to Eddie--nor Mady Christians for that matter!
Alonso turns out to show all signs of a coward when he is captured.
I also don't like that Cartoon Channel is marketing "Grim and Evil" towards young children, when the humor---again, much in the vein of the wild and crazy "edgy 'toons"---- is gross enough to be considered adult.
I used to watch this show when I was 12, but after a few years, I suddenly gave up on it.
The thing about this show is that it's too dark to be a kids show it literally gets away with murder with it's humour and story lines and just it's plain weirdness like when billy starts to work with cthulu.
I had the chance to meet Daniel Jenkins about 12 years ago when he did a local production of Twelfth Night.
Three years ago when I was watching the Cartoon Cartoon Top 5, and first place went to an episode of the Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy named Night of the Living Grim.
But seriously the first rap cassette I ever bought was Fat Boys Are Back in 1985 when I was 9.
Back in the day(early 90's) I/we/they took De La Soul's lead and shunned R&B and commercial rap so I never felt the urge to see this...  ...until now, as I watch the people who used to be plastered to my wall when I was a kid in what appears to be an actually good movie!
When I heard the title 1st I thought it must be a horror movie or something but when I saw it I enjoyed it very much.
I liked the beginning, when he told his students they would be "worm food" and told them to listen to the dead past students as he whispered "Carpe Diem!
I am so much surprised when i see that this movie takes 7.7.It deserves much much over it.It is certainly in my top 10.
So when his father threatens to withdraw him from Welton after his successful debut in a Midsummer Night's Dream, he might argue with his father or turn sullen, but it strains credulity that he would go to directly to suicide.
I watched this film the first time when I was 10 or something, but was falling in love with the film when I was 17.
I can say that when it comes to a great drama movie, Dead Poets Society should be on your 10 choices list.
The cast:The cast do a really good job at making the people feel very real.You can feel Williams moving away from his (very good)comedies,to giving really great performances for dramas.But,the main stand outs are Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leondas as Tood and Neil.They both give really great performances that make you feel they really are friends,and that when Neil dies,Hawke does a great job at showing the sadness he has,for losing a friend in such a sad way.
He was such a good guy, including Todd at the beginning when he had no friends.
Everyone was sad when he died, and though the other boys had their 'Tiffs' he wanted everyone to be friends.
This actor looked so different when he was younger and his role here is completely different from (for example) "Before Sunrise" and "Before Sunset".
I would say that this is a most typically American film, in the slightly derogatory sense this word often has to Europeans when used in cultural issues: It is dominated by ideas, such as freedom, but the words remain empty, devoid of liveliness, and there is not the slightest hint of the idea that flight from authoritarian order could mean something else than following a sectarian leader.
Unfortunately, this works against him when he loses his son, in that we feel no sympathy for him at all.
Not only do you see wonderful character development, but some of Hawke's most expressive acting occurs when he has no dialogue at all.
Williams is okay as the teacher, but all credibility is lost when he stops to toss in imitations of Marlon Brando and John Wayne.
How many of us mentally revolted at the dissection of poetry when we were in school?
Many a viewer will both chortle and rejoice when Mr. Keating has his class rip out the methodical, emotionless "Introduction to Poetry" from the time honored Pritchard textbook!
As another reviewer has wisely pointed out, his best scenes are sometimes when he has no dialogue at all.
In the beginning, when the young men are first introduced to this idea of sucking the marrow out of life it is applied by the students when its results prove to be fun and joyous.
I first saw this movie when I was 13, and immediately stamped, crowned and elevated this movie as my all-time favorite.
I saw the movie back when I was in High School.
Back when you are young, you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life.
You know trouble is brewing when dastardly rival Donald Crisp (as Don Sebastian) is spurned by "belle of the Archduke's ball" Astor.
He ends up framed for a crime by the corrupt officials of the Queen (who are made jealous when Don Q saves their commander from a bull with his whip, impressing the Queen with his courage).
Film sequels were a novelty in 1925, when DON Q, SON OF ZORRO marked a big profit for United Artists.
While enjoyable on TV or home video, the movie is twice the fun when watched with live accompaniment and an audience as I was fortunate to experience at Cinevent 2006.
this is a movie i saw with the 5th floor back in the day when it came out at the drive in .... some of the scenes in the movie stuck in my head some 30 years later until i tracked down a 15.00 copy off ebay... re-watched it and now I'm not taunted to find it anymore but do not regret getting this nostalgic scary cult classic... worth the watch BUT you must keep in mind that you have to put yourself in the year it came out to watch it not the year were in... that way you can fully appreciate the special effects that were 'from' the day not today.. because they obviously don't compare... well its definitely worth finding... pay for the copy not original that can run you 200+ dollars from places that actually still have a few... thats all... enjoy...
The problem begins when the kids start sitting around telling each other ubran legend-ish scary stories to pass the time.
There's one really odd part when the "kids" start tapping & clicking out a rhythm which slowly builds into a cacophony that drives one of the females into a rage.
The movie ends with a freeze-frame of them running hand in hand, and I can't help but wonder if maybe the last few minutes of intended action was abandoned at the film lab when they couldn't afford the processing bill.
They could have been anywhere, the summer camp angle only serving as a device to make it more difficult for them to seek out help when their lamps start running out of fuel.
It's a tough spot to be in, when you are not a teen, to successfully understand the current teen crazes and fads, let alone the mindset!
So it's trouble enough trying to capture this successfully when you are a big Hollywood mucky-muck like Altman .
A few of them, are gone now, but that is one of the reasons that I loved this now but not when I saw it then....how strange, but funny.
The way you would be embarrassed to see a friend make a fool of himself when he was drunk.
I don't remember what film we intended to see, a comedy I believe, but when I saw there was a horror movie playing in the other theater I decided to watch it while my brother saw the comedy.
I begged my family to take us to it when it would come to our local drive-in.
In the era of the DVD, when video stores already pressed for space now find themselves in the position of having to clear out mucho shelf space to make room for both VHS and DVD copies of the newest Kate Hudson film, many odd and obscure VHS films that have sat for ages are now disappearing.
If the answer to that is zero, like i think it is, than distributors who dare to spend lots of money attaining the rights to obscure films like this will end up taking a bath when no one buys them.
These actors may have been amateurs, but when called upon, they really do make the ending of this one sing with apocalyptic passion.
Reminiscent of some of the '30s Bogart/Walsh collaborations, in style if not in pace, "The Enforcer" is a first-rate crime thriller, and even more of an accomplishment when you realize that Bogart is, to be honest, miscast.
Bogart's character is presented as more of a dogged, plodding but sharp bureaucrat (when was the last time you saw an "action" hero who wears a bow-tie?)
That being said, and Bogart being Bogart, this is still a top-notch noir thriller, with some of the best character actors in the business (Ted DeCorsia, Roy Roberts, Jack Lambert, Bob Steele, Zero Mostel) filling out the cast, a dark, oppressive and somewhat claustrophobic tone, and some particularly--considering the time in which it was made--gruesome moments (the scene between sadistic hit-man Bob Steele and gang member Danny Dayton, when it slowly dawns on Dayton that *he* is the intended victim, will make your hair stand on end).
You won't hear "The Enforcer" mentioned when it comes to Humphrey Bogart's body of famous work, but it's a very watchable mystery that pulls you in early, and keeps you interested with each new revelation.
Apparently, Mendoza's murder for hire racket had quite a few customers; when Ferguson has the authorities dredge a swamp where a couple victims were expected to be found, they wound up with an evidence room table filled with the shoes of his victims.
With only a few hours to find a way to put Mendoza away for good, Ferguson strains his memory for a possible clue that may have been largely ignored when Rico initially gave himself up.
And when killer Digger lets out a yelp knowing his turn has come, I was chilled to the bone and without need of fancy special effects.
This to my knowledge, is still unconfirmed, but when viewing the picture as a whole, it certainly boasts the feel of Walsh's better known pictures.
One moment in the film that is simultaneously comic and chilling comes when Rico is on the way back from a murder.
These hearings were given national television coverage during a period when the medium was very new to most viewers and the revelations about the pervasive nature of organised crime and the existence of the outfit known as "Murder Incorporated" attracted extremely large audiences.
The case files confirm that the investigation started when a frantic young man called "Duke" Malloy (Lawrence Tolan) visited a police station and reported that he's been forced to kill his girlfriend.
It transpired that he was a hired killer who'd fallen in love with his intended victim and when he'd initially refused to go through with the job, he'd been pressured by other gang members into completing the contract.
The colourful collection of characters featured in "The Enforcer" are brought to life vividly by the excellent cast and Humphrey Bogart is especially good as a man who is extremely determined and powerfully focused on his task but is nevertheless also very controlled and methodical when necessary.
What five-year-old child at any time in the last forty years would be unable to interpret 'contract' and 'hit' when encountered in the context of a thriller/noir/caper/gangster movie yet here, in 1951, both hard-bitten detectives and an Assistant District Attorney are as bemused as Hoosier tourists hearing Urdu for the first time whilst on vacation in the sub-Continent.
For a few moments this tends to strain credulity when watching this in 2010 but we're soon wallowing in the great casting that tosses such disparate actors as Bob Steele, Zero Mostel, Everett Sloane, Roy Roberts, Ted de Corsica and Bogie into the mix.
Especially when there are plenty of great lines in the film to enjoy, and even mimic over and over again:  Such as Ted De Corsia's "He ain't human!
My favorite shock scene is when a hit man realizes he's about to be "taken care of" by an old crony, he makes a desperate break for it into the night, letting out a blood-curdling scream.
Still The Enforcer is a personal favorite of mine for Humphrey Bogart films and I think you'll like it too although when you see it you will see what Bogey did that almost blew the whole case.
I personally thinks he deserves a "Best Supporting Actor" Oscar for this role, but when a movie only makes $30,000 at the box office, I guess the academy doesn't even consider you.
I recently sat next to such a family when the film played in March 2003 at the Grand Action cinÃ©ma in Paris.
It was in 2000 when I was there with a group of 'producers' trying to interest wheelers and dealers in a film project when we were suddenly 'adopted' by a television crew who attempted to use us as leverage to get themselves into the celebrity laden MTV party.
His gang inevitability come into conflict with the local establishment, but when he discovers his childhood sweetheart is to marry a police captain he struggles to maintain peace between the gangs and the authorities but his efforts (much like our film project bid) quickly spiral into untold chaos.
Drink when  *The maidan looks sorrowful *Anyone looks at a picture of their lost love *Anyone goes 'Ahhahahahaha.
The violence is quite noteworthy and bloody and is grossly accentuated by the richness in the colour so that it almost seems characters spout bright red paint when they are shot.
Perhaps it was my being 16 when I first saw the movie and latching onto ti for being different (and funny), but hey, if it ever gets re-released, I will re-buy it.
It particularly sounds worse when whining or screaming.
When they're out in a boat they run afoul of some bullies & Rumpoey almost drowns when the boat is overturned but "Dum" saves her & brings her back to where her father is staying, and he's whipped severely for his transgression, by his father.
And, when was the last time you saw cowboys become "blood brothers" by cutting themselves, dripping their blood into whiskey, and getting rip-roaring drunk in front of a statue of Buddha?
It's one of those films when style is everything.
Although when it gets into Western extravaganza with the wild shootouts and loud explosions it's simply eye catching with the amount flair and wham-bang awe that's generated.
I remember when this movie came out and my parents took me to Sea World because they had all the props out used in the movie...I was embarrassed to even be in a picture with that stupid looking shark.
I saw it in the theater with my sister when it came out and the only thing that was worth the money was the 3-D effects...this crap was on TV and I feel the need to vent because it's 2 hours of my life that are gone forever.
His disregard for others is confirmed when he casually murders a fellow train passenger in order to assume his identity and pass across the border.
The actors appear to try their best with the material, but how can actors get noticed when the film has little plot (at times) and lots of drooling sickos molesting and beating women?
Mostly it's just one of those movies you would watch on cable when reruns are in season-and the reruns suck would you watch it.
Like another reviewer already stated, Vernon here strangely resembles Marty Feldman when he played Igor in "Young Frankenstein".
I was completely shocked when I saw this film.
There are precious few films of the silent screen superstar Mae Murray known to exist these days and when a new one emerges it's a cause for celebration.
I should add that Mae Murray seemed to be imitating Mary Pickford when she was in her comedy cups, down to gestures, mannerisms, facial expressions, it was uncanny.
The ending of this movie has a terribly clichÃ© moment in it when one of The Rough Riders die, and his friend holds him and does the same dreadful thing they do in all movies when a character dies.
But no matter how bad it got, I still liked the Under Water kindom idea and when the shark was swimming around it and scaring all the people.
A particularly funny(that's right funny) part was when the shark trapped a group of people and they were all moaning and crying.
And what a time: when rich young men from Park Avenue sincerely believed it was their duty to take part in their country's wars, and a politician who started one went to fight in it, when artists calmly painted oils of battle, and correspondents walked toward the sound of the guns...
I'll skip trying to tell you what was on these peoples mind when they went to war, however, TR had been de facto Secretary of the Navy and a politician for quite a while so I vote for less naivete than hinted at by another commentator.
With the eyes of the world on them, the 'Rough Riders' train (Elliott says, bluntly, "I'll teach them to become killers"), bond (the cowboys are stunned when Ivy Leaguer Noth easily breaks a stallion, then are told that he is a champion polo player), and show complete devotion to the eccentric but beloved Roosevelt ("He's one of us," one cowboy says, proudly).
Some historical points have been stretched a bit, here and there...Bucky O'Neil was a madman who refused to keep his head down and got shot right through his cigarette ... Fighting Joe Wheeler was a bantam rooster of a man (5'3") but with the heart of a lion who did indeed keep referring to the enemy as "the Yankees"...TR's Rough Rider's attack was up the nearby Kettle Hill (Cero de Olla) where they racked the Spanish position across the narrow gully with deadly fire; when the Spanish [and there were about 1,500 men-- not 500, as some reviewer suggested] broke to fall back to Santiago, TR boldly took off alone toward the San Juan Heights (Los Altos de San Juan)having forgotten to give the order to charge...  OK.
That opening gripped me when I was a kid... where did it go?        
Two examples: One of the most powerful scenes is when Linda (Franka Potente - Germany's latest shooting starlet) prosternates herself in front of the Holy Virgin during the Semana Santa in Seville and prays for strength and courage.
The espionage angle is brought back to the forefront when a Lambert test bomber is hijacked by veteran character actor I. Stanford Jolley.
DUM,DUM,DUM,DUM.....Just when you thought you were safe from sequels... Comes this second dreadful,horrid,and poorly acted film.Louis Gosset Jr. sports a terrible ghetto accent thoughout the film,probably hoping he won't be recongnized.James Bond Hopeful(at the time)Simon McQuade plays a Costeuo-like Documentary filmaker,Mr.Fritz-Royce who*spoilers ahead* gets swallowed whole by Mrs. Bruce.Bess Armstrong(High Road to China) plays the love interest,but hey, at least she's better than Karen Young in Jaws the Revenge.Dennis Quaid(The Parent Trap,The Right Stuff,Dreamscape) is the now grown up Mike Brody,who with Martin Brody out of the film,is the hero.John Putch is Shawn still afraid of the Deep Blue Sea(get it?
So when I put this DVD in, to my surprise, the only dinosaurs I saw was stolen stock footage from Jurrasic Park 3 which they continued to play over and over again but without any real relevance to the story/plot.
But when you watch it, "King of the Lost World" ends up being a ridiculous piece of excrement about a plane that crashes somewhere in the Amazon, and the people's attempts to get the plane in good working order again and head back home.
If the women are rarely more than eye candy, the men are compelled to wrestle with the various technological & situational challenges that the storyline tosses at them--which they do less well than my friends & I did in first grade when we played in our backyards & argued about what was supposed to happen next.
Some characters have so little screen time that when their time comes you are baffled because you have no idea who they are or what the hell they were doing to warrant such a killing.
This guy who is horn-dogging on the arguably good looking photographer notices it (he later gets killed by a giant scorpion in a cave when the scorpion puts it's stinger through his chest cavity).
The stewardess was very disappointed when it was pointed out that it wasn't their plane, after all.
I suppose it was inserted at a strategic point in the film to grab the viewer's attention just when they were planning to hit the eject button.
So when I saw that they had done a King Kong type movie that mixed with The Lost World I got excited.
With the technology thats available today for creating believable CGI effects, it inexcusable to release such a sub standard movies, especially when it seems to be released on the back of the New blockbuster "KING KONG".
I saw this movie when I was 15 yrs.
Lensed by Robert Surtees in Death Valley as well as locations in Gallup, New Mexico and at the Ray Corrigan Ranch in California, this western boasts striking scenery that Sturges puts to great use during the last half-hour when the Indians launch an attack on our stranding group of heroes.
Fort Commandant Colonel Owens (Carl Benton Reid) sums it up when he explains to Roper that the POWs outnumber the guards at an outpost in the middle of nowhere infested with hordes of bloodthirsty Mescalero Indians watching their every move.
Matters grow complicated, however, when Carla begins to reciprocate the love of the man that she is supposed to distract.
You can tell when the filmmakers are on location and when they are using a studio.
But please, take note from this review - when Carl Gottleib put pen to toilet paper we thought we'd have on OK movie.
It takes a while for it to take off so to speak but when it does there are some real thrilling action and some real good scenes and moments you don't easily will forget.
*SPOILER* I really liked the scene near the end when they were caught in open by native braves and had to take shelter on the ground with just some rocks and walls of dust to protect themselves from spears, arrows and bullets.
I recommend this to western fans with some patience because, as written, it takes a while for it to reach climax, but when it does, you won't forget you watched it.
But when that escape comes, led by Southern Capt.
Even Bravo's commanding officer (Carl Benton Reid) thinks he is too harsh ("Roper when I see you work at soldiering - I'm glad we're in the same army").
Eventually they do make good their escape and the remainder of the picture has Roper and his troop in hot pursuit after them through dangerous Mescalero Apache territory culminating in a a very exciting sequence towards the end of the picture - when after a terrific chase by the Apaches - captor and captured are pinned down by the indians in a desert gully.
Some artists never know when to leave greatness alone.
I know this ISN'T the opinion of everyone--so if you LIKE when he tugs at your heartstrings and helps a damsel in distress (yet again), then you'll be thrilled.
Then, when the shot cut back, the pants leg was back ON!!
Her joy is short-lived when she is brutalized by the ringmaster for her lack of perfection.
Chaplin's brilliance was never so clear as when he portrayed every day life in all it's mundane little details.
In a picture filled with an excess of wonderful vignettes, chased by a mad donkey while holding an enormous stack of dishes, Charlie's surprise when he opens a trunk to find it full of wild monkeys, his boastfulness at surviving a moment trapped in the lions cage only to be frightened by a kitten, and William Tell with a banana, Chaplin left still more on the cutting room floor.
I am definitely an amateur and may be a dilettante when it comes to being a serious film reviewer/critic, but this movie has SO very much to offer to the movie-lover, that it is a sad commentary on the state of our commercial arts that it remains largely unknown to all but the ardent silent/chaplin aficionados.
- the entire aristocratic air of the tramp settling down for a hobo's breakfast; when the chicken clucks by and charlie runs off to chase it, there's a pregnant pause of expectation...did he get it?
'The Circus'may not be Chaplin's very best movie,but it is a joy to watch,especially when you consider the turmoil he was going through while he was making it.
THE CIRCUS may well be one of the best of Chaplin's silent comedies, especially enjoyable from the point where he inadvertently becomes the hit of the circus when he pinch hits for someone at the last moment.
But when it comes to Charlie Chaplin I can't imagine his work being as entertaining any other way than silent, with him relying on pantomime over voice.
Maybe this is just me, but I really think that the parts of Chaplin's films where we see the tramp before the story has started going are generally some of the best parts, because we get quick looks at the tramp's personality Â what he does with himself when nothing's going on.
There is a very clever opening to the movie, as Chaplin twice finds himself the victim of pick-pocketing, once when another man's wallet is slipped into his pocket, and another time when that wallet is stolen from him before he realizes he has it.
In The Circus, the tramp happens upon a failing circus and inadvertently becomes a huge success when he unknowingly interrupts the show.
The highlight of the film occurs when the tramp decides to impress the girl by substituting for the no-show tightrope walker.
I will not see The Circus until many years later when I saw it again on television.
It's very funny that Chaplin cannot pass the audition for The Circus but is very funny when it comes to showtime.
But while "Limelight" focuses mostly on the interaction between the performer and the audience, this film seems to explore two different themes relating to performance: its hypocrisy (the tryout, being told to eat the apple by the director and then being chastised for eating it by the actor), and humour in its deficiencies (note the uproar when Chaplin knocks the table off, exposing the hidden man feeding the animals through the hats).
The best example of superb timing is when Charley pulls a chair out for himself and replaces it just in time for the circus manager to sit down in.
Despite this danger, and despite Chaplin's off-screen egotism, the premise plays beautifully, especially since The Little Tramp (though not Chaplin) is such a terrible comedian when he's trying to be one.
My favorite moment is when the ringmaster demands the auditioning Tramp to be funny right that instant: the Tramp grins and shyly dances around a bit, gingerly falls down, puts his cane between his legs and meekly lifts himself back up.
We essentially find ourselves laughing at an unemployed homeless man who needs to make an ass out of himself in order to escape the police -- which is nothing worth laughing at, when you really think about it.
But when film-makers have personal struggles, it typically only increases the authenticity and greatness of their work (just look at Woody Allen's career).
I enjoyed this a lot more the second time when I could see it on a very clear DVD print.
But even when Gosling figures out how Hopkins did it, he cannot be tried twice, because of the double jeopardy law....  Who will have the last laugh?
The interesting parts of the film are when Hopkins' character, Ted Crawford, is in the scene or it is about him.
I'm sure when he went to jail and he had the gun on him, they said, "Oh, OK Mr. Crawford, we'll just hold this for you until you get out."
It was a nice plot twist about the switching of the guns, but to have it miraculously returned by the prison when he leaves, basically made the movie a bit unbelievable.
Now, I don't like obvious foreshadowing in films, like when the camera dwells far too long on the item you're supposed to take notice of.
Example three: the cop leaves his gun lying around when he plays with the wife.
Facilitating the plot mangle are such miserable devices as these: when the wife is shot in the face with a Glock .45, she doesn't die; the homicide detective and Gosling happen to use the same model cell phone (which triggers the lamest Eureka moment in the history of cinema); Gosling spills coffee on his suit right after his tux is delivered for the party he's suddenly invited to that happens to be at the Disney Center and this all allows Hopkins to suddenly divine Gosling's "point of fracture," from which the movie takes its name (and makes no sense), like the "tell" scenes in Rounders and Casino Royale; and finally Hopkins, devilishly clever and brutal, happens to need to talk a lot for some reason.
What was the purpose of that and didn't this provide ballistic evidence when those bullets were retrieved?
Raised by Gosling, but unanswered in the plot, why did Crawford remove his wife from life support when he could have simply left the country for good as a free man.
Had we known that Hopkins' character had bought a gun that was identical to a police model, we would have known what happened from the beginning but we weren't even allowed to see the gun until near the end of the film when Ryan's character pulls together the pieces of the plot.
Ed Norton has the same kind of looks but Ed can turn on the smoldering sexuality when he needs to, Ryan tries but just ends up looking like a horny pool boy.
I wanted to see him prevail and was extremely disappointed when he did not.
No, I only side with the bad guys when their motivations are actually honorable, for this truly was a matter of "honor" in an old-fashioned sense, and/or when the good guys are no more than cardboard cutouts.
The story is about sorting eggs on a farm when he was a boy and about putting aside 300 eggs that all had minute cracks or imperfections.
*p.s.- about an hour and a half into the movie, watch David Strathairn's character when he goes to Beachum's house.
His car is parked in one direction, and then when he goes back to it, it's in a completely different direction.
It doesn't take Willy Beachum's (Ryan Gosling) eyes off the price and even when it falls apart, he doesn't appear to care much (it's all about getting Crawford behind bars) or to feel a need to make it right.
the entire film is just enjoyable to watch, making the end of the film even more enjoyable when the story comes out and the roles change.
non-cannabilistic) Hannibal Lecter, Hopkins plays Ted Crawford, a wealthy L.A. businessman who shoots his wife when he discovers she's having an affair with a hostage negotiator.
Beachum gets more than he bargained for, however, when the creepy and unnerving Crawford begins to play the legal system for all it's worth, tweaking the hotshot lawyer by outthinking him and continually knocking him off his game.
Willy Beachum (Ryan Gosling), who has a 97% conviction rate and is assigned to prosecute Crawford just when he is ready to accept a lucrative offer from the prestigious LA law firm.
The two of them hit it off so well that when Burton's charges are dismissed, he goes to work for McQueen.
But he's still the McQueen we know and love when he confronts the Texas ranger played by Ben Johnson.
At a mere 14 (13 + 1 extra OVA) episodes, I was kind of doubtful it was gonna be any good when my friend recommended it to me.
Unlike the previous two films (in which we're subjected to the pig-headed-ness of one dollar-hungry Mayor), Calvin made me laugh when I realized his character was just all attitude and 'talk.'
He is speechless when everybody realizes they have a serious situation on their hands: 35 feet of man-eating death!
Don't you just hate it when your emotions are taken advantage of, your heart strings are pulled at when you least expect it, or when you see a lovable character die a gruesome death?
I mean, come on..  Then there's the moronic Kohta who does little more than act as bland as he can before the onset of his next little flashback to yet another oh-so-cleverly concocted plot device - Lucy killing his father and sister when he was a child.
First don't be turned off by what you see when you Goolge search this Anime title.
Again don't be turned off by what you see when you search on Google Image, the show is very deep and well done.
Trouble begins when one such diclonius, named Lucy, escapes from the research facility off Kamakura (and we are treated to a gruesome scene in which she disembowels and kills 23 guards).
The music caught my attention from the very beginning, when the opening lighted up the screen.
It does this all the while without feeling disjointed, it has an elegance and clever subtly when it makes these strong transitions that makes it all the more mesmorising.
Not just the anger and the suffer, what Lucy/Nyuu has feeld when she was just a child and then from that moment maybe always, but as she has start to live as Nyuu after the accident at the middle of the first episode, she has became close to a real character.
Of course Kohta cannot forgive those horrible things, but finally Lucy has truly turned out to be a really good character, who finally get close to her love, and have tolled him everything, everything with one kiss, and in that moment we can see again their childhood, when they two have played with each other eight years ago, without "any" troubles.
Well Kohta sad to never hurt somebody again, so I think when her second horn has broke off too, she lost her vectors, and she has died.
Kohta was surprised when he saw the big antic clock has working again, on which one Nyuu has worked.
The Songbox still plays Lilium, but when it stops playing it, the clock has ringing and the anime has ended, The End.
At the end when I saw that Lucy has kiss Kohta I really thought that they could be with each other forever, and when I saw that her second horn has broke off too, my heart has nearly broke too.
There love cannot be fulfilled, but Lucy's heart truly could get some rest, and each other was really happy in that moment when they have kissed each other, much more happy than everyone could ever be.
The story seems to be a little bit simple for the first look, but when you get further and further into it, you will find out, that you are really caught, and this great piece of art won't release you, until you watch it all.
I don't care if you arn't really into anime - I really wasn't when I first watched this.
Mess of love, the main excene is when two women are in the ladies room of the opera crying and talking ironically about their affairs and marriage situation and Roberto(John Malkovich) is in the cornice trying to avoid them to discover his promiscuity; ne of the girls open a window and face Roberto there(lol).
What were they thinking when they made this movie?
I noticed early on that this movie was taking an deep plummet toward tastelessness when I figured out what was happening to the children!
it trails along and leaves off like a seven year old making it up at a camp fire and then ending it abruptly when she realizes everyone has stopped listening.
the only reason i watched the whole thing is because i'm paralyzed and when in bed i couldn't shut it off myself, lol.
I should mention that I missed 15-20 min about half-way through the movie when I went to wash the dishes that had been piling up in my sink for about a week.
I thought that it was a really good film, and had strange creatures, but what did any normal monster movie person think when they first saw the title...?
My first brief acquaintance with "Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell" came when I watched the trailer.
The Great White Shark when it finally appears (this time its around thirty feet long) is laugh out loud fake and cheap.
), who gets into a spot of bother when she is taken prisoner by a big ugly brute and his reptilian pals.
It plays before the films as opposed to when you select 'trailer' on the menu.
Wolfie worshipped Che Guevara, and dreamt of 'the glorious day' when the downtrodden working classes rose up as one and threw off the shackles imposed on them by their capitalist masters.
One of the best episodes was when the T.P.F.
I'd have thought when Shirley left, the show wouldn't be as good, it was still a masterpiece.
I still suffer severe depression when I think about this abomination.
As for Sharmila Tagore, she was the same as rajesh khanna.. the second half of the movie is quite touching..... Look at the way the song "BADA NATKAHT HAI" is used in the background when Vinod Mehra returns to search pushpa..
I was still very little when this show aired here in Europe, but even so, I still remember two shows me and my family were sort of addicted to : Sledge Hammer and Raven.
It's strange how a film can claim to have three dimensions when every character in it only has one...
I needed to see vulnerability in each character, when all that was given was cold calculation (which even the hardest CIA agent is NOT).
A truly awe-inspiring spectacle of destruction and abandonment that mirrors man's insubstantiality when measured up against nature in his own power to destroy it.
a part meant for showing the machines trudging around is labeled as being part of 'dinosaurs', or when the people set the oil on fire and the others are "mad" in coming in on it).
He also gets two interviews with women who were around when the war was there- one who is given no words for what she says except that her husband was killed, another who had a child with her and who is now traumatized- and somehow this too works even out of context.
It adds a level of mental discomfort, but then that's likely a big part of the point- seeing the oil burned by order of a government that's been on the news we watch every night is one thing (or rather was), but it's another to suddenly take it in another light, where in the realm of science-fiction it asks the viewer to raise questions via abstractions one might forget when taking it as complete truth.
As an ardent "scholar" of B-movies, I found particular delight when happening upon this little piece.
The climactic fight is really disappointing and unsatisfying too; we are left with an unfinished fight right when we expect a punishing finish.
Why make a 3-D movie in the first place if you're not going to take advantage of it when it's available for the home video market?
The video looked bad when it was released as a rental.
These people just couldn't spit out their lines and when they did it was hard to understand them because of all their indecipherable accents.
Ben Oren is a literary Genius when it comes to this movie.
As the friends drive out to an isolated log cabin I was thinking The Evil Dead (1981) crossed with a bit of Cabin Fever (2002) & when I saw the woods I was also thinking that the filmmakers had recently seen The Blair Witch Project (1999) along with Friday the 13th (1980) & it's fairly easy to tell that these (& more besides) had an influence on Ghost Game, but then it goes into a slightly different direction with all the supernatural stuff & the game.
Unfortunately it makes no real difference as the annoying character's remain, the whole story when you think about it doesn't make any sense, the horror aspects are disappointingly tame & as a whole the film sucks, it's as simple & straight forward as that.
There is zero atmosphere, tension, scares or significant gore apart from a bit when someone falls on a branch & is impaled on it through their throat.
I Love this show (although I was a baby when the second series was aired) All the characters are so cool especially Tucker, Garvey, Nancy and Donna.
This was an amazing TV Show, is is a shame that i couldn't watch it when it was first televised.
Special effects will suffer when viewed with out 3-D glasses, however, the film is still enjoyable to watch.
Later, the film takes a plunge when hungry mamma is let out, and all hell breaks loose, literally.
Fox execs and shareholders in 1977 must have thrown their collective hands in the air when presented with this infantile vanity project from a clearly unrestrained Gene Wilder: he wrote directed and starred in this excruciating and labored so called comedy and it is a blueprint for NOT allowing temporarily popular 'comedians' free reign to be auteurs.
ok maybe not really but it sure felt like it the first 60 or 70 times i saw it as a kid on cable i loved this movie cause it was so freakin funny i watched it over and over and over again laughing myself hysterical every time and then when i saw it like 15 years later i laughed so hard i broke a rib laughing ok maybe not really but it sure felt like it ya know what i'm sayin
The film was not well received when it was originally released.
Take for instance the scene when Gene/Rudy, in his exaggerated Hollywood craze thinks he sees Greta Garbo dancing in the hotel garden, falling/jumping on "her" dancing partner, only to detect Garbo is a transvestite.
It looked so damn fake when the shark went through the glass at the end of this ridiculously bad film.
A part that bugs me is when they say they are going to bait the shark near the end they are saying they will use a live person as bait, but at the end nobody is used and all the shark does is swim at them and through a glass window and tries eating a bunch of people.
Back in April of this year I heard that The Worlds Greatest Lover was going to be on AMC and I was like yes I'm finally going to get to see this movie, I'm a big Gene Wilder fan so.....yeah, anyway the only problem was that it was going to come on at 3 in the morning on a Monday which was a school night for me so I asked my mom to record it for me, so when I came home from school I saw it and thought it was awesome, two or three months later I ordered the DVD off of Barnes and Nobles and I now have it on DVD what I had heard from this movie was that Gene not only stars in this movie but writes, directs, produces, and surprisingly wrote a song for the film as well, I think Gene's take on Rudolph Valentino was pretty cool and I think he came up with some clever ideas like "histerical laryngitis" and sticking your tongue out or twisting your words around whenever his character is nervous.
Unfortunately, we get much more of Wilder's tendency to mistake hysteria for the hysterical Â when in doubt, shout seems to be his motto Â with Wilder adding a nervous tic that sees him stick out his tongue when he gets nervous.
It is just sad when people are down on a kid's movie, as much as they are down on this one.
It was sad when they had their break up.
The acting between Vanessa and Zak is 101% you could almost believe that they are head over heels in love when singing "you are the music in me" and "I gotta go my own way" Every member of the cast in fact gave a 100% for me.
But when i watched it for the second time i thought it was Fabulous.
That's when I realized, that many of the songs were not as memorable as they had been in the first movie.
Most are excellent in the movie, but many don't seem quite as catchy or stick with you quite as well when you're away from the TV.
Though in the end, when Zac Effron and Vanessa Anne Hudgens came together to sing, the magic really happened.
Part two finds the entire cast of Part one ready to celebrate the summer, when (with the help and dastardly doings of evil sharpay) the entire school manages to end up working at a posh resort.
I think I got that idea when I saw Sharpay's musical number with the pink piano in the swimming pool.
The title "High School Musical" makes no sense when applied to this movie.
I loved HSM 1 and i was really excited when i found out there was going to be a hsm 2.
The first opening sequence was good, the song, the dance everything was good until they took it out of the high school and that was when it all went downhill.
The character of Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) was i thought not even in half of the movie - and the only good bit was when she stripped and got into her bikini (although I've pretty much seen it all if ya know what i mean!)
So when I heard about HSM 2 I knew it was going to be pathetic.
he has a nice voice when he is singing those remedial notes, but give him some actual soaring notes and he will croak like a frog because he does not posses the range.
I almost choked on my own disgust when Troy complained that he was fed up of seeing all the rich people at the Country Club while his parents were 'scraping for pennies'.
Don't say your kids won't get the jokes either-I got them when I was seven!)
The best comedic moments are when Beatty is in his "rapper" mode, speaking in rhymes at campaign functions and tv interviews.
I laughed so hard when he raps.
I had no interest in seeing Bulworth when it was first released, and only gave it a chance on video since virtually every review I'd read recommended it.
Except for the romance being unlikely, the rest of the movie is well done- his staff is played to the hilt- including their duplicity when things start working.
This is both awe-inspiring and goofy at the same time, when Senator Bulworth, tired of what he's doing, suddenly decides to speak the truth to voters.
I thought I would cringe when Warren had his Adrian Brody moment, but when the inevitable happened I didn't even barf!
while this becomes a classic(10 years old already), i must say that i have seen this feature at least 5 times( not counting when seen it with company or parts of it).
Warren Beatty probably gives the best experience of his career.Halle Berry has only a supporting role in reality BUT she does have a political oriented speech that is one of the most outstanding speech ever given on the big screen, when it comes to class oriented views.
"Never make life of death decisions when you're suicidal," explains Bulworth during one of the film's more invigoration sequences.
All suitable questions that will all be answered when you see the movie.
Berry is actually good as well in her pre-movie star mode when she still bothered to act.
Once his speeches and raps become a success, this is obviously a big problem since he wants to live again ("You should never make life and death situations when feeling suicidal").
The consequences of their actions prove very costly for the explorers, when the sailor sets about their downfall for taking him away from his island paradise," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.
I won't spoil things by revealing the solution to the mystery - it works extremely well, and the moment when the nearly frozen Culp manages to get back into the station and confronts Wallach, axe in hand, is one of the classic scenes of horror, t.v.
And then, after the not unpleasing island sequence (the whole idea of the shipwrecked sailor not wanting to be rescued is a reasonably appealing one), we have to put up with a mind-numbingly miscalculated twist in the plot when morose Jose suddenly reverses character and turns himself into a daringly enthusiastic Captain Ahab, battling a primitively superimposed stock shot of a giant manta ray.
And it is the talented Miss Owalee who contributes the movie's one successfully pregnant moment when she collapses on the beach after Jose deserts her.
Repentful the next day, he listens again to Irene's idea and becomes enthusiastic when he sees Eric's formula first hand and they start a business that brings them all fortune within a few years.
Things really start to get nasty when Bickford then sues her for divorce, alleging adultery on HER part and dragging her through the mud with paid-off "witnesses" who claim knowledge about Irene's "affair".
Even when Bickford proves that he's a wretched jerk and cheats on her, Dunne is like some sort of saint and she refuses to divorce him.
Then, when Bickford and his sleazy lawyer drum up fake charges that SHE is committing adultery, Dunne is just too sweet to really fight back.
But Dunne turns the tables when they try to grab custody of the baby as well.
This leads Alex to start spending time with Lily Linda (Ginger Rogers), a burlesque dancer whom he happened to meet by chance when he was out in his boat and she was swimming in the river in distress.
For instance, when Alex has kept his secretary and chauffeur waiting on the street for more than an hour while he's been in Lily's apartment, the secretary finally goes upstairs to fetch Alex.
What does the secretary see when he opens the apartment door?
How can it be 2:45 NOW when it was 2:45 back before Marcus ever went upstairs to Lily's apartment to fetch Alex.
I couldn't believe when Lily is shot ( it happens about half way through the film) Alex callously cleans the apartment to get rid of evidence that would incriminate him.
The film was a typical period B film of man finds girl when wife doesn't pay attention to him.
They are willing to admit when they don't find anything and this makes the show refreshing and unfake!
Plainly the scene that said it all for me was when Mr FBI is getting some TLC from that Barbados copper, crap accent, and they repeat the scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark.
The one where Mr Ford is getting TLC from Ms Allen on the pirate boat, when Mr Ford is pointing to the bits of his face that hurt and Ms Allen is kissing them.
agents so inept that upon catching a shark whilst fishing, they will shoot them for good measure; women are nothing but mere objects that should dress in bikini's and keep their mouths shut when two epically superior men talk business with one another; stealing things is a good thing to do and theft is generally sexy.
Then there is the further evidence that this film exists for mere comedy driven romances when Lloyd begins to develop a relationship with Jamaican police officer Sophie (Harris).
If the film does do something right, it's that it ends when we want it to.
I remember when I was a kid saw my first horror movies in the late 70s, this one scared me to death.
Don Cheadle's talents are wasted in a thankless role as the villain--just when you've forgotten he's even IN the movie, he turns up again to bring the film to a halt.
I think everyone needs to lighten up and enjoy a good film when they see one.
It wants to tell us not about the planning and execution of a heist, but what happens when two robbers - Max Burdett (Pierce Brosnan) and Lola Cirillo (Salma Hayek) - retire to a gorgeous island away from FBI jurisdiction and find out paradise isn't exactly all that it's cut out to be and that robbers get bored.
And when all else fails, she leans forward to allow us to glimpse her cleavage.
Lackadaisically directed by Ratner, who made the "Rush Hour" films and turned "Red Dragon" (2002) into simply another serial-killer flick, "After the Sunset" just doesn't know when to quit.
And like that film, audiences may find themselves confused and bored over the lack of action and plot twists (this film has probably the least amount of surprises of any heist film in recent memory - but when you become emotionally invested in the characters like this, that's a good thing).
Max and Lola say no, but Max is further tempted when suave gangster Henri Moore (Cheadle) offers Max an offer he can't refuse.
Someone commenting in these pages put it better when he said that we could rehash this film, analyze it, and make it into what it was not intended to be, but the fact remains that if we had a pleasant time while we were watching, it was well worth the price of admission.
Even in the 1970's when American films were some of the best ever, Film critics then were also not appreciative of what they had before them.
Our best scene (without spoiling it) is when the three start dancing and handing out flowers, with Louis Armstrong crooning Cole Porter's "You're The Top" in the background.
But soon trouble happens when agent Nine returns to the land of the kangaroos...cos the question is : who is the father?
Even if you can guess ahead of time who or what is behind it all, you'll still feel a shiver go up your spine when you see that final close-up.
The tug of war waged between mother and daughter comes full circle as does everything else when Selena murders her stepfather in self-defense, goes on trial, and so in a sense, does Peyton Place.
Lana's testimony at Cheryl's trial was seen as a direct parallel to her performance as Constance in the courtroom scene in the movie, and in later years, Crane revealed that her mother's husband prior to her involvement with Stompanato, Lex Barker, was molesting her, another coincidence that did not go unnoticed by Crane when she first saw the movie.
Dr. Lucas Swain, a marvelous Lloyd Nolan, will come to the aid of Lange, when she is accused of killing her stepfather Kennedy.
For the most part when I do this I am somewhat disappointed in the movie.
I must say that the film certainly does not lack plot points Â there are many plots to the story, yet when it was all over it still felt somehow anticlimactic, due to the unrealistically up-beat ending.
You just knew that someone was going to end up having to take control over the sickening situation of her family life, and I cheered when (her fear still paralyzing her to fight completely) the doctor (a superb Lloyd Nolan Â extremely believable as a caring physician) came forward to help rectify the situation and clear her name.
Some other reviewers have pointed out that the movie was called "A Cold Night's Death" when they saw it - that was also the case as far as I was concerned.
This is one of the prime examples of what happens when screenwriters take a great book and for some unknown reasons change a great deal of the plot.
This film has many good moments, the best one when the doctor exposes the wounds and the truth about the dwellers, but also shows lots of clichÃ©s.
Peyton Place is a great and realistic observation of human behavior taken in the context of when and where it was written, no matter how shocking truth may appear.
I was frightened if not scandalized by the big city lifestyle when I moved to the city to attend medical school.
I, too, saw this on my L.A. ABC station as "A Cold Night's Death", when I was a teenager.
Katie Blake does a superb appearance as Helen, a teenager about to finish school and go to college, when "Dear Nobody" shows up and turns her world up side down with a tough decision to make and some well hidden family secrets to discover  Sean Maguire as her boyfriend also delivers a solid performance, but not quite reaching up to Blake's standard.
Okay this is when things got terrible and the main reason is that we are forced to watch over the hill guys save the day.
The action starts when a deceased friend's sister approaches Chappy for help in taking down a Nazi drug lord who is holding her Peruvian village hostage.
The film is 15 years old, so she was in her mid-30s when she made it.
Most of the inmates are monotone, like most people are when reading.
The actresses seem almost over the top in comparison, but I'll bet it made a powerhouse performance when experienced live.
I happen to be a rather big fan of his and am trying to be patient about when I will be able to see the movie.
I have no idea of when it goes to video and if the networks are going to air it, but I am sure everyone on the film did a bang up job, and I mean everyone, including the grips and other BEHIND the scene peoples.
Normally, when a movie is bad, we turn it off, but this one we watched just so we could tell everyone how bad it was.
I hate to say this but I hope this movie isn't issued on video or DVD, the fact that it IS so rarely seen and it's more obscure and therefore a little more of a surprise when (if) you can see it.
This movie further proves that Martin Scorsese is the best director alive, and sadly he always gets overlooked when it comes to the Oscars.
Complication arises when Johnny betrays Amsterdam, thus revealing his true identity to Bill and to everyone in the Five Points.
I will definately buy the DVD when it comes out.
Actually when I turned on "Gangs of New York" I thought it would just be a Period-Drama where characters wear funny clothes and talk with funny accents.
There is a wonderful balance between the two actors and when they share the screen the definition of 'movie magic' becomes all to real.
I don't go a lot of movies in the theatres, but when this one came back out after being nominated for a pile of oscars, I made the mistake of assuming that it would be a great movie.
Plus, the actors doesn't fit in the story, the casting director is really a clown, or he was doped when he chose the actors.
But, when you look at the body of work and more importantly the intelligence and multi-level approach of Scorcese's other films, this film completely fails in comparison.
You never really know why he hates Irish immigrants so much (a mere generation away from being an immigrant himself), and you never understand why everyone in The Five Points slum is so loyal toward and protective of him when he does absolutely nothing to alleviate the poverty and squalor of their senseless, miserable lives.
And if there are no good guys, why are you supposed to be cheering at the climactic scene when (for about the 11th time) the streets yet again run gooey w/blood and body parts?
This is a perversely tempestuous violence-riddled film filled with gore, viciousness and intensity all in good use in order to demonstrate the living conditions when everyone had to sleep with one eye open.
It recreates a time when violence was rampant and for the purposes of storytelling, the violence quotient was necessary to give justice to the lewdness of the situation.
So, when this highly publicized movie finally opened, I went and saw it.
"Gangs of New York" takes us back to a time when America was a young country and New York was divided.
I was in Turkey when the movie was first released however I haven't heard of it until I saw in on DVD, since it possibly was not well advertised due to financial issues but the cast and the plot is really spectacular, and well directed.
I was not excited when I learned of the show coming to television, but after they closed off the initial story arc and continued with new material, it took off and had the potential to be a great series.
I was over the moon when I found out there might be a sequel coming out soon.
This movie is not a cinematic masterpiece, but when you rent a Trauma movie it's generally common knowledge you're not getting "Godfather".
Some people seem to think this is a criticism, but when you consider how popular those 1980's horror flicks were, I don't see it as a criticism at all, I just view the movie as a retro-flick.
The film is actually quite enjoyable, but only during the moments when the plot doesn't necessarily have to make sense, like for example the neat sequences of the town in chaos or when the demon possesses random souls in order to gain power.
Definitely not a must-see, but if you're a fan of silly horror, it's worth watching when it comes on TV or something.
However, when they are talking to their friend poking fun at him about having a drinking problem over drinking 11 or 12 beers a night, that's sad.
Drew (Andrew) witnessed his parents' divorce when he was 11 and how it ruined his father's life.
That said I did not like the film when I first saw it.
I never even knew about this film when it came out.
I really liked everything that they did to William Lightbody (Matthew Broderick), and when Eleanor Lightbody (Bridget Fonda) snapped at the people wearing animal skin.
During the entire, dragging, boring debacle, there were perhaps two occasions when it was worth a slight smile.
Meanwhile, plenty of plot thread, personality, and expose of vastly different attitudes in a time when life was cheap.
It's one of those films that you think is funny, but when you recall it at a later date, its even funnier.
The movie is set just after the turn of the 20th century, when the town of Battle Creek was host to dozens of wannabees who attempted to develop and market their own vegetarian breakfast foods.
This film is a lively, tongue-in-cheek rendition of the intriguing story about an era when entrepreneurship in the U.S. was at its peak.
What happens when you don't pay the editor?
Not having seen this film before, it came as a total surprise the other night when it was shown on cable.
Complicating things further is Nicole Maurey and her two kids who Parker's fallen for and then Chandler takes an interest when he sees her.
I have always hesitated when seeing the DVD at the video store, but finally watched it.
One unconventional incident during the voyage occurs when the ship encounters a wrecked spaceship, and dispatches a boarding party.
Add to this the changes wrought by the American bastardisation of Voyage To The End Of The Universe, that included an ending which anticipates Planet of the Apes, as well as its possible inspiration to Kubrick when planning 2001, and Ikarie certainly offers much of interest.
A flash-forward to when (infected by the same source, as we learn later), one of the crew is wandering, bewildered and aggressive, through the ship.
Considering that this film was made in 1963, in Czechoslovakia, at a time when so much sci-fi schlok was produced in the spacefaring United States, this film is a rare, welcome sight to the eyes.
And yes, dubbing CAN be done well, when done RIGHT!).
For me the most striking sequence is a daring, risky, and potentially scandalous commentary by these Soviet Bloc filmmakers when they have their explorers encounter a derelict craft floating aimlessly & without power in the empty nothing between the stars.
They are long dead, mummified to the point where their bodies disintegrate when brushed against, and had apparently been killed off by the military flight crew when it became clear the oxygen supply was about to run dry.
Along with the Russian PLANETA BUR and the East German/Polish SILENT STAR aka FIRST SPACESHIP ON VENUS, this is one of the most important & overlooked masterpieces of science fiction from the time when manned space flight was becoming a reality.
We are never shown anything more lethal than a hand blaster, when it comes to weapons.
Shockingly, when I've talked to people who've seen the US Version or read about it in Film Reference books, their view of the whole film is not only tainted by these 5 seconds, but actually results in their dismissal of the film's quality.
"Ikarie XB 1" stumbles badly, though, when it comes to the exterior effects work.
The ladies of the court are very active schemers and plotters in the course of events, culminating in the incredible sight of Tirant forced to lead his knights into battle when he has two broken legs suffered from a fall, attempting to breach the princess's bedchamber.
He redeemed himself when, after one bit of shaggy-dog dialog, he looks askance at the perpetrator of the utterance with a disgust filled sneer.
I used to remember when b-grade movies used to have at least some redeeming quality about them, be it the effort that some actors went through to do what they must to make a buck, or even something about the story that had a certain charm.
I saw this on AMC when I was a kid and still remember it.
I was also disappointed that when musical clips were shown, the movie they were from was not always identified.
Still, I couldn't help but be a little disappointed when I saw this film on the May schedule.
Finally, the intros to clips by Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly are inane and offer absolutely no valuable information or tidbits (Where was Neal Gabler when we needed him?).
However, I find the material a bit corny and unnecessary, but still good to watch Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly - I hope I'm in that good of a shape when I'm that age!
Showcased along side the great musical numbers, comedy and melodrama are given equal screen time with stars like Kathrine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy realising that together they could lick 'em all, John Barrymore begging Greta Garbo to stay when she so obviously and characteristically 'wants to be alone' and Clark Gable showing us exactly why he didn't give a damn!!
This was Fred's last ever dancing on film of which he said later, "that wasn't dancing, that was just moving around"  I especially liked the finale when they reel off a long list of the movie stars who have featured in the compilation all done to music and all done in rhyme.
However, the real treat from these guys are not what they were doing in the link up's but rather what they did way back when, and fortunately in That's Entertainment Part II there are more classic clips than you can shake a stick at.
It's also a delight for fans of both Astaire and Kelly when these two dancing men, you know... dance together again.
I didn't like the voice over at the beginning, we don't need it  The soundtrack is very smart, I loved the moment when The "nene" speaks the  voice over and we can hear Billy Holiday.
Christopher Guest is usually reliable when it comes to hilarity.
It's starting to become a distraction, especially when said stars are getting "funny" make-up jobs, like Willard's bizarre bleach-curl and O'Hara's plastic-surgery parody cheeks.
I even liked the ventriloquist Nina Conti -- and I normally run from the room when a ventriloquist comes on.
I never thought the day would come when I would regard a comedy written by David Mamet as superior to work by Guest & Levy, but here's a tip: if you want to see a good send-up of movie making, try Mamet's 2000 film, "State and Main."
But when appeared the information that it was based on a true story my breath was taken away.
I reacted this way just when I had seen "Dancer in the dark".
Drenched with his deadpan wit, Guest's mockumentaries have been such well-targeted show business satires that it's hard to know when the script stops and the improvised reality begins.
Guest and Levy fully capture the superficial pandering that occurs when the buzz is in full swing, and they particularly ridicule the ignorance and outdated thinking of those who find themselves in this lightning-in-a-bottle situation.
I truly can't wait to see this movie again when it goes wide release.
If, as Guest insists, this film is not intended as a satire of Hollywood but is rather the tragicomic tale of what happens to someone when they are told that they deserve an award, we should be spending less time on all the Hollywood in-jokes and parodies, and more time with the characters themselves.
The best sequence is when Larson E Whipsnade is selling tickets to his shows & a couple of seedy characters give him a large bill to make change of to pay for the tickets.
Then Larson E. makes his most famous quote when refusing their refund, "Count your change before leaving the window!"
So much of this film seems already acquainted, from its appealing crime thriller stylization to its narrative echoes of Reservoir Dogs, Heat and Bonnie and Clyde, that when it takes one of its unprecedented turns it overcomes you.
Burnt Money could have almost been made in the 1970s, when a film with the promise of spectacle in its subject matter was almost expected to take the more complex way to the end, no matter what the end may be.
I'm sure you can figure out how that goes, especially when prospect in-laws Thurston Hall and Mary Forbes meet Fields at a little clambake they're throwing.
Fields does his normal shtick regarding the mumbling, sometimes mean-spirited insults, double-takes when loud noises occur, which was frequent; scheming people out of money, running from the law, etc.
Then again, you can only invent a musical language once, and the process of doing it will always be remembered more fondly than when the music continues without the same degree of innovation.
An uneasy truce is reached but when Rikki flashes a double peace sign at the crowd he only succeeds in looking like Richard Nixon.
The movie seemed to create true to life account of an obsessive love and the downfall it can take when you have your "friends" knowing every detail.
This is a film which I was very surprised when I watched it.
Inspired by a true story, this movie took place in Argentina and Uruguay in 1965 when a couple of gay lovers involved in a money robbery and then hunted down by swarms of cops.
But when different gets so out of line...I wouldn't say it is a spy thriller, because I don't think it is.
Â»Agents secretsÂ« is a thriller partly inspired by a recent incident when French secret service (DGSE), which belongs among the most discrete, sank the Greenpeace ship.
All of these films were directed by Europeans even if some belong to A-List Hollywood milieu, meaning that Europeans, especially Brits, are the go-to guys when it comes to spy yarns.
Even when two frogmen slip into the water to plant a mine it cuts away to Â you guessed itÂ  When, after 40 minutes, Bellucci reveals she's planning to quit the French secret service, you think: her legs must have got tired of all the walking.
Even when he's tailing a suspect, he gets out of his car to... do I even need to type the rest of the sentence?
Which is a shame, because the plot isn't bad when it finally kicks in - in the last twenty minutes.
You be the judge when you see it.
The film manages to find new ways to thrill and narrate the story; and that when the espionage thriller field has already been saturated with Hollywood super-productions; so for a French movie to succeed with half the budget and with a European sensibility is great going.
There are minor gaffes like the makeup in places, the panicky way the agents are always looking around (why are they being so obvious in a crowd when they are supposed to be secret, eh) and some flat actors.
Of course, when you decide to take a movie genre and break all its rules one by one, it helps to have two major movie stars by your side.
The recognisability of it makes it even funnier, especially when you then go back and watch the real news and see those things happening there.
There's no bigger fan than me when it comes to Chris Morris's brilliantly scabrous spoof news work from the 80s and 90s, but come on folks!
Be warned, though: there are no pauses to let you laugh and no punchlines telling you when to laugh (a lot of people can't seem to understand humour without the latter).
So when the opportunity to see the sequel arose, I must admit I was curious and hopeful.
Besides showing an unusual homosexual relationship, the film also questions the relationship between sex, love and violence - even when the main characters turn "straight" violence and death hang in the air, with scenes sex often interspliced with those of death and agony.
I remember this movie got panned when it came out, I read what reviewers here said about it, so I wasn't expecting much.
Well, what I understood was that dates were not necessarily expressed in "Terms" and that Debra Winger's character had actually died in 1973 - with fifteen years added to Melanie's age of three when her mother died, that would account for her being a college freshman in 1988.
And when Melanie keeps going back and forth between her relationship, she finally finds peace with Aurora, who she at first despised.
I thought that was beautiful because even though Rosie was the maid, her and Aurora were like family and when Aurora was carrying Rosie in the rain to take her home for the final moments of her life, that was truly beautiful.
Now when this movie first came out, no one really saw it.
So when some of the cast came back 13 years later, it can lose some of its box office draw.
In relation to the ads for the film, you can tell how big a star is when they have to refer to him as "Casper Van Dien from Starship Troopers".
But Van Dien gets one of those instinctive feelings, the kind that Chuck Norris gets when his Cherokee people are in trouble on Walker, Texas Ranger.
But things do get real complicated when Jane follows him to Africa.
He sounded silly when he used it.
This film's drawbacks are minor when compared to those of other adventure films.
The most notably scary sequence takes place at the beginning of the movie, when a mean-looking "rag man" stalks the night streets of Minden town, searching for wide-awake children to transform into mice.
It's not a horror movie and there are only two brief scenes that could conceivably land it in the genre; the first is a somewhat botched gang rape around a campfire and the other is the "revenge" scene with two guys fighting with hatchets and knives that is cut short before any blood could be spilled when one of the characters decides to do the "sensible" thing...
(I know it's totally politically incorrect for me to call it 'sort of' when, in fact, she is assaulted and the assault is sexual in nature, though apparently no actual penetration takes place as Keach has trouble getting it up.)
They may be thieves and murderers, but when Nene looks into Ãngel's eyes, you know instinctively that their love transcends life and death, and is destined to last an eternity.
Well, the other reviewer was right when yelling out that "Slashed Dreams" is NOT A HORROR MOVIE, but it does feature some typical exploitation trademarks.
There are also windows, and at least two large holes in the roof, so that when they say they wish they could lock the door, it sounds rather funny!
A cynical show would have had Bradley die as a cheap joke, but when it becomes clear he will be all right it feels genuinely touching and far more rewarding.
He spends the whole night trying to stop Kyle, but when he comes to no avail, he decides he'd rather expose himself.
It's never fun when one movie completely dominates the awards, this really wasn't the case this year.
Morricone wasn't too happy in advance that he received this Honorary Award, claiming that it would look like as if his career was over already but nevertheless he seemed emotional and touched by this honor when he stood on the stage, next to his friend and interpretor Clint Eastwood, since Morricone himself (still) doesn't speak a word English.
Often when (male) actors are asked to "play gay" you get an overly sexualized relationship - as though they feel the only way to portray the connection between men is through overt lust.
I can understand enough of the language to be able to pick up when the sub's aren't direct, or are leaving out dialogue.
In a film such as this, when so much of the plot depends on the characters and their relationships, it becomes agonizing not to know exactly what they're saying.
I used to watch this show when I was growing up.
Now, in conclusion, when and if this show is ever brought back on the air, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
Laughed so hard and then fell apart when Allison started to sing.
Somehow though, when Ari Meyers left the program, the spell seemed to have been broken.
Kate & Allie was one of my favorite shows when I grew up.
I remember when CBS's Monday Night was the place to be with shows like this on the air.
It occurs at night when one of the starving prisoners comes to Vanessa to express her love for another prisoner.
I don't know all about her personal politics and don't care when it comes to seeing a movie like this one.
I am fortunate to have taped it when it originally aired.
After Atomik Circus, the hyperactive Belgian BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde is yet again jumping with young directors and writers in a crazy movie with lots of pace, plenty of ideas and references, a lot of humor (JC Van Damme laughing at the image of himself that was built and then that has spread to all french-speakers in the world after several interviews and comments he made when on drugs again and again, several crazy TV appearances saying stupid things absurd semi-philosophical metaphorical sentences in a very pedantic tone while they meant nothing because he was stoned etc...) and some critics made about current society with wit, discretely etc...He succeeds at making his crazily pathetic character very touching and above all hilarious as always...
Fantastic cast : Guillaume Canet, Zabou Breitman (= two directors ), BenoÃ®t Poelvoorde as Lenny Bar (there is a game of words with this name in French so that when you pronounce his character's surname + last name it sounds as if you've said : "the boobs"...Stupid right now but funny during some scenes in the movie...LOL!
Narco  Highly promoted by the young and trendy Guillaume Canet, I wasn't overwhelmed of joy when I decided to check this movie.
Some people think this is bulls*** : i say one should never laugh at the power of a dream or an idea when it is really the sens of someone life !
But his sickness finally provides meaning to his life when he starts turning his dreams (heavily influenced by his father's love of American action movies) into comic books.
Harmon Walsh is an absolute hottie, but he's also a terrific actor making his debut here as Johnny, the hero who finds himself with a big problem (aside from the Ice Queen) when he gets drunk and sleeps with another girl, Elaine, leaving his girlfriend, Tori, rather upset.
As Audrey, Walden is stuck with seriously bogus wise-cracks which are groan-inducing, particularly when she challenges Ice Queen to combat.
Daniel Hall Kuhn is the scientist who gets all excited and enthusiastic when discussing his specimen..he's the kind of tool who attempts to thwart our heroes' mission to kill the bitch, and save themselves.
Any chance to believe anything in this movie vanished when the 911 operator hung-up on the bartender after calling him a drunk.
Now, it could be because I'm a High School teacher of History, and I might be more critical about historical incorrectness than others, but I do believe more people will hear their skin crawling when they claim the Homo Erectus (which only lived in Africa by the way) has a body temperature of -30Â°.
I don't recall his name, but he commented that at first you may think the actor playing Dr. Goddard is a bit awkward, but when you realize the horrible lines and situations, and direction he had to deal with, you will also realize he must have the spirit of Brando in him to pull it off half as well as he did!
Got a big laugh when my son compared the ICE QUEEN Monster to BeetleJuice.
I honestly don't know where to start when summing up this film.
The whole Ice Queen thing is wrong, no explanation is given as to what she is, when the equipment in the back of the plane stops working there would have been all sorts of alarms going off as is the case with medical equipment, if Ed phoned the emergency services to report an avalanche they couldn't just say 'we don't believe you' & not bother to investigate, the emergency services are obliged by law to respond to a call for help & that's a basic fact.
Also, when Johnny & his mates crawl out of that air vent at the end there's no snow anywhere & the ground is dry, where did the snow that covered the building go all of a sudden?
Okay, yes, there are some pretty ridiculous and hilarious moments - as when the monster gets momentarily taken out by a common bathroom fixture, or anytime the monster is shown just standing there going "blaeh!
To create a monster nowadays is hard enough, and when you do come up with one that can potentially scare the paste out of someone, it's usually wasted in horrible "horror" movies or commercials.
Now in terms of already expecting a disappointment, I am not not disappointed but still throw up my hands when pondering if cheap CGI is the all sum total future of movies, then I will cancel all my memberships of the evil celluloid corporations and just buy the classics and F the rest.
The worst scenes of the movie are when the granulated sugar avalanche consumes all these little train villages, and the wet t-shirt contest that takes up the first twenty minutes of the movie.
I hate when people say that about a movie, but hear me out on this one.
I had gone on a Kung Fu binge at my local video store which has a small but semi-decent selection when as I was nearing the end of their selection, and I picked this up.
Poorly written---it bounces between sitcom stupidity and soap opera histrionics--and definitely doesn't leave you with a "warm and fuzzy" feeling when it's finally over.
The supporting cast is strong, but like the leads they seem to be pulling in different directions throughout the film, and when all is said and done this rather lengthy film feels quite a bit longer than it actually is.
First viewed this film when it came out.
Bette received her second Best Actress Oscar nomination for her commanding performance here, She lights up the screen whether Dixie is upstaging Eddie in front of thousands of troops during WWII, cursing out sponsors during her and Eddie's television show, or tearing Eddie a new one when she thinks he is trying to steal her son away from her.
It can safely be said that she is more than just a great singer and entertainer, but (when given the right material) she is one hell of an actress in comedy or drama.
The three principals give first rate performances, Middler best in the scene when her son dies, and Caan earlier, when he witnesses the death of a boy soldier in Korea (his first witnessing of such a tragedy in a war).
By the end when she goes to Vietnam she is a vulgar, disgusting, embittered slob who harbors some anger that the GIs no longer swoon over her as they did a quarter of a century or so earlier.
Too many subjects, too many levels, and the make up department didn't do their best job when giving Midler and Caan the "age" look.
FOR THE BOYS illustrates the damage done to a story when the writers refuse to be fair to a major character.
There are times when he truly frightened me.
The performances on the whole are restrained; when the occasion for histrionics comes, both stars rise to it.
The highlight of this film is her understated performance of "In My Life" at the small Vietnamese camp - truly a moment when the world stops turning and we are graced with a glimpse of heaven.
"Songwriter" was one of the 1st movies I bought when I got my 1st VCR.
The plot concerns Willie's character, Doc Jenkins, attempting to liberate himself from a contract he committed to when he was younger, drunker and a little less immortal.
I just found it again recently and although the movie looks a bit dated today, it certainly takes me back to a time when individual movie making wasn't that common.
The clever writing and the funny dialogue when the story associates Dupah's first bite which losing ones virginity, like when he is scared to bite someone and says what if my fangs are too small.
I used to watch this when "USA Up All Night" was still on the air (Gilbert Gottfried and those timeless B-movies).
What follows is a tale of double dealing (by Slip), romantic entanglements with Helen Walker ("cute eyes" as Lucky calls her) and Lucky's partial redemption when he realises just how bad the Nazis are (when they beat up his "ma").
There is a really good chase scene when the baddies are after Lucky in the gardens.
Bogart (when he too rises to stardom in HIGH SIERRA) is an intelligent and loyal lieutenant to good old Donald McBride, but McBride's other lieutenant is Barton MacLane, who is a corrupt ex-cop (so he's totally bad).
I saw "Distant Drums" for the first time when I was 10 or 11 years old and I recall it was a great film for me.
I used to watch this show when I was growing up.
I was so crushed when they removed it, and anytime they had it on TV after that I was over the moon!
I remember when this show first game on back in 1998 with the Burgerking toys that they had for that month with the Kids Meal back then.
no not the one where Donnie popped one in her hair but i forget where the setting was in the one were she blew the big bubble when it popped on her face) under the Accerlator pedal and they RV got stuck.
I plan on taking everyone I know to see this when it comes out in March.
Imagine my surprise when I saw a poster for this movie hanging on the window of a Christian bookstore.
I know it will touch the heart of all who watch it and give hope to everyone out their that a persons heart can really change when love, which is given to us by God because He first loved us, is practiced and felt in our lives.
Hence, it is quite understandable that Jason, showing little concern, storms out of the will-probate office when he learns when Grand Daddy has not left him any outright money in his will.
We are to believe Jason buys into this when he could be savoring that $25,000/night Paris hotel suite.
I have always thought it is such a clichÃ© when people say "Oh this movie made me laugh and it made me cry."
When Red dies Jason shows up late for the funeral and makes a scene when he does show.
Besides, it's always a good thing when genre shows have titles that reference classic literature: could the island be a much scarier, more realistic version of Wonderland?
My one and only reservation about "White Rabbit" is that having an episode so focused on Jack when he was already given plenty of screen time in the previous episodes and especially in the Pilot was perhaps a bit unfair to many other characters.
You don't even need to have the subtitles on if you are lazy and just want to watch it in english you won't notice almost any times when the characters mouths move different from what they say.
I really did wonder how they would escape the elevator shaft, one of those great moments when you don't know whether to laugh or hide your eyes.
Later on when he's up pitcher Bobo Newsom administers some chin music to Skelton at the plate.
He is attempting to use the telephone to assist his new client, Wally, when he is driven to anger by an aloof operator.
Watch too when the comic quartet is trapped in an elevator shaft.
But when a comic is on a roll, there are bound to be a few stale puns.
Skelton, and a horde of comedians race their ways through a tale about how Wally is mistaken for a suspected serial murderer when all he wants to do is go on his honeymoon with Anne Rutherford -- and who could blame him?
He had just produced the movie version of BORN YESTERDAY when he died suddenly at age 41 in 1951.
His movies are unfamiliar to most people because his contract called for extra fees to him when his movies played on television!
I can't wait to see what this director can do when he has a bigger budget.
Just when I thought the son would show us some humanity by leaving his gross father and gloomy taxidermy shop, perhaps becoming a Hermes model or something meaningful like that, he ends it all by taxidermying himself!
Its a throw back to the 70s, when filmmakers had the guts to load the screen with offensive and politically incorrect imagery to force the viewer to think.
Lynn manages to gain access to the baddies HQ and guided by Sue who runs all the techie stuff manages to kill the Chairman - one neat trick is too flood the building security systems with music - in this case The Carpenters Close to Me - so you end up with a kick ass Kung-Fu fight sequence set to Burt Bacharach.....which you don't see too often.... A local maverick cop(Hong at Hong - Karen Wong) is soon on their trail - things become complicated when the next hit they undertake turns into a set-up and soon the two sisters are fighting for their lives while trying not get arrested.
I got somewhat excited when Barbara Hershey's name came up on the opening credits, but boy, did she portray one of the most disappointing female characters of the movie!
And when the dam finally breaks, it's just pretty pathetic.
It's one of those movies you just might end up watching when it comes up on TV while you're 'zapping' channels and have absolutely nothing else to do.
Perfectly acceptable Irwin Allen drama, with some funny special effects - I particularly like it when they put a water tank in front of the lens, trying to simulate a high-water mark for a "dry shot" scene - and some even funnier acting.
Especially us younger ones, I even said I wish I could do that :D Dancing is so much fun, and when you find out why others dance like that, you start to respect it little more.
I actually had no intentions of seeing this movie when I'd first heard about it.
I was not born to this type of violent society but my husband was and he was very excited when he saw this movie that he said that he was going to buy it.
Its not about Anger Its not about being "ghetto" or "hood" like many people perceive when they see this movie.
The dancing in this film is amazing, to be sure...you will wonder how people can move like that, so fast, so crazy, particularly when you see a 4 year old girl or a 300 pound woman do it.
Secret political message of the film: why are we spending money in IRAQ when there is so much need here?
The most recent game I got was Evil Dead Regeneration which was about a week ago.This is the newest game in the Evil Dead series of games which were based on the films.I have never seen the films.This game is not bad.Its pretty fun especially when you have the little midget sidekick named Ssam who you can kick around.He also makes funny comments.At first the game is pretty hard especially when you have hoards of zombies coming at you but after you get Sam it gets easier.This game is a horror/action game with comedy.Bruce Campbell who was ash in the movies is the voice of ash in the game and he has really funny one-liners.So does Sam Ash's half deadite sidekick.The game is about a man who must kill all the zombies.Evil Dead Regeneration is an alright game but I suggest buying it at a cheap price.
Lloyd is, of course, crushed that no one will take him seriously, but the joke's on everyone else when he manages in true Lloyd style to win the girl of his dreams.
The irony is he has been secretly readying a book on how to be romantic with girls while working his day job as a tailor's assistant, back when a guy could still be a tailor's assistant.
It's all the more thrilling when you realize these are actual hands-on stunts Lloyd performs without a stuntman.
I watched this today and don't know when I have laughed so much.
The publisher and his staff find it hard to keep a straight face when they meet the author of the "Love" manual face to face and decide to publish it as a funny book entitled "The Boob's Diary" - unbeknownst to Harold who thinks he now has nothing to offer "the girl" (played prettily by Jobyna Ralston).
This movie rocks, especially if you update the music a bit, and why not when Silent accompanists just adapted the standards of their day?
In the meantime a publisher whom he sends the book to rejects it, but later changes his mind when he finds his staff roaring with laughter over Harold's described romantic technique.
By the way a very funny sequence happens when Lloyd initially thinking it was another rejection letter tears it up and then sees the torn check.
I won't spoil this for you except to say watch this film when you get a chance, & when your done viewing it, find out the other Best Picture's title, watch it, & you will be able to tell what was borrowed from this film in the other one.
Besides, it is one of the great romantic comedies of the silent era, full of breath-taking imageries(like the scene when the Boy was dreaming about the Girl while fishing under a bridge..).
Lloyd showed some wonderful drama acting ability too(when he had to dissuade the Girl from seeing him any more).
And when the viewer thinks Harold can't possibly top himself, he ends the film with one of his marvelous chase scenes, in which he uses every sort of conveyance (train, jalopy, horse, fire truck, trolley, motorcycle & sand wagon) to stop Jobyna's marriage to a cad.
Throughout, Harold displays the remarkable athleticism for which he was celebrated, made even more astonishing when one remembers that he had lost half of his right hand a few years before in a freak studio accident, a disfigurement he disguised with a prosthetic glove.
There are films for holding sticky hands in the back row, looking into each other's eyes; there are films for getting all excited with tons of special effects to bedazzle eyes and minds of onlookers; there are films for filling up the useless hours of television when only insomniacs are available; there are films hyped up to smash shattering box-office record sales with all those glorious glamorous Hollywood stars; there are films to put on at Christmas and Easter every year, supposedly to remind us what the heck we are celebrating; there are films for just dozing off; there are films for Saturday afternoon so that the kids won't go out.
Why are there so many women who want to do this, when there are so many failure stories already?
Another aspect of this film that is worthy of comment is that, when the woman who left her husband first appeared, she was wearing a pair of tights with the pattern of the American flag.
The film then inexplicably jumps forward in time some years to when Billy is grown up (and strangely sporting an Australian accent!)
That was a very interesting bit of information I found out because it does make more sense when watching these Godfrey Ho Ninja movies.
It grates my potatoes when I read reviews on this site that say things like "This is worst film ever!"
It's only when they go after ethnic groups that they lose me.
Still, they shine in several scenes, most notably when Groucho first meets Grover and proceeds to insult him while simultaneously wooing Margaret Dumont with Romantic poetry.
But there's a great song and dance number when Groucho first enters the store.
The Marx Brothers' fall came about when their films overutilized special effects, fast motion, and sound effects to enhance the comedy.
It was at this time that Mr. Thalberg got his wish when he brought the Boys to MGM.
And when the comedy we're all there for is actually going on, the boys are as sharp, fresh, and at-home in their shtick as ever, with Groucho making a welcome return to ironic self-referentiality, not to mention Margaret Dumont.
I first saw this movie several years ago when I was really on a role on seeing films starring the Marx Brothers, I loved a lot of those great comedy teams, Abbott and Costello, Martin and Lewis, Laurel and Hardy, and The Three Stooges!
This movie is really hysterical, I remember that when I saw this, I was laughing so hard, I fell on the floor in tears, I honestly thought that I was going to die, this is so very hysterical!
But, when after reading the credits in back of the case I realized it had been written by the same author of the first film (Ringu).
His main media outlets were records, radio, and as one of the premier nightclub attractions, especially when he appeared with his second wife Cyd Charisse.
Even when it does work, it's never as good as the Marx Brothers' material, and even their work is too often strangely flat.
Here, the plot is often difficult to follow, and when you do manage to follow it, it just isn't that interesting.
But there's a great song and dance number when Groucho first enters the store.
The Marx Brothers' fall came about when their films started overutilizing special effects, fast motion, and sound effects to enhance the comedy.
The parrot was funny especially when everyone applauded and Ade says "Thats right give the lump of plastic an applause!!".
The way they improvise when something goes wrong (missing lines- Rik's speciality, tripping over wires, doors flying open) is PURE CLASSIC!
When these two guys get together you know your in for a great laugh.The way they have to improvise when one of them makes a mistake is just poor class.As with there other video's which I also think are excellent if you in a badmood and need a little bit of cheering up look no further.I think that this video is ALMOST as good as some of the second season episodes and i hope they get around to doing at least one more bottom video
Philips interest in Roxanne grows and is put to the test when she invites him over to stay - when her parents are out!
It's important to remember that when trying to rationalize the yellow peril attitudes that are in this film.
And, when someone offends the tong, it's Robinson's job to kill--even when he is ordered to kill his best friend!
He prospers and when the girl grows up, he marries her.
I should mention that Loretta Young was only 19 when she made this movie and she was remarkably sexy and seductive.
I bought this movie when it 1st became available (to the tune of ~$65) because I was there for some of the shooting and my car was in the movie.
And I have always thought that was a good sign when it came to works of art.
This is actually a good thing when one considers the originality of the movements and the length of the scenes themselves, which greatly exceed most of the action sequences in previous (and subsequently released) movies.
It's hard for me to explain why I love this movie so much, but only because I'm not that articulate when it comes to speaking what's in my heart, I guess.
Well, anyway, I think it's simply amazing when a film can stick with you long after you watch it (especially nowadays with all the disposable / forgettable crap that's out there); and, sometimes, like with this film, for reasons you're not really sure of.
I admire what has been reported to be an uncompromising stance when it comes to how his films are released and promoted, but isn't the whole point to reach as many people as you can?
I get the feeling that when they were making this film they had planned to make a serious horror, and after watching it, they knew, to save face, they would have to promote it as a dark comedy.
I felt robbed that I had spent $15 Aussie Dollars to buy it, but then I thought about how the financial backers of this film would have felt when they saw it!
when the movie started it was obvious it was a low budget movie.
Back when cable TV started, there were tons of softcore porno movies being released to late night cable.
And a BIG plus for Endless Waltz is that Relena didn't scream to Heero when he obviously couldn't hear her.
I've seen a bit of the series and when I looked it up on the web, I just had to go and buy it!
When I look at her on screen now I'm ready to do all the things Jim Carrey does in the 'Mask' when he see's Cameron Diaz dance at the club !
The great thing, I remember, about watching Charlies' Angel (2007) as a 7 year old, was that when you came out of the movie (and for the next few days)Âyou felt you were Qi Shu !
White Reflection is a little too upbeat to be a good ending theme, especially when the movie's ending is taken into consideration.
Just when you thought the final battle between the Gundams and the Serpent mobile suits in Brussels could not get any more epic, it just did.
That really doesn't make sense when you think about it but hey it's a cartoon so stuff like that should be overlooked.
The young pair whom only want to enjoy their lives, the barman that finds a new way of living when he contracts an Asian cooker.
Best film to remember your country and the important things of life when you're away.
Maybe you won't experience that when you will visit the city or Spain but that's what make a difference...And I hope we won't loose it...Enjoy it!
One of my favorite scene, is when Lynn (in the french version) jump out of the window (at the beginning) while her sister is asking her to not forget the cake.
Some women do go a little crazy when it comes to their wedding day.
i loved this movie, i saw this movie when it came out on DVD,because of Kate Hudson, i had recently saw how to lose a guy in 10 days from my sister and loved that movie.
when i saw this movie i thought it would be so funny,it didn't really have that many funny parts, there was a couple, me and my sister were cracking up when Kate woke up in the morning and her hair was blue and she went to work because she forgot to get it dyed back to blond,and she used her shirt and wrapped it around her head so the people she was working with wouldn't see her blue hair, and so during her meeting all she had on was her pants a suit jacket and her bra,and it was so funny.then when the shirt fell off her head and she was telling the people that she was fighting with her best friend and everything and then she sat down and she ripped of part of her hair and was like "oh my god i'm gonna be a bald bride"that was funny....it is a chick flick/comedy, for that reason it was good and i would totally watch it again.
...because I wanted to watch this movie when it came out in theaters.
I watched it when it aired on HBO.
How are we supposed to care for the two leads in Anne or Katie, when they act like spoiled little brats, to see who can get there wedding jammed in 1st?.
Katie's character is so self centered, that it completely ruined a lot of the movie, and it disgusted me when Anne started stooping to her level.
Romantic Comedies are supposed to be light hearted, with a sense of seriousness to it, but this goes far beyond mean spirited, I ended up hating both of them, when all was said and done!.
Bride Wars often tortured me, and I was glad when it was all said and done.
The shortcoming of "Bride Wars" is not sustaining this eloquence throughout, when it deserves it.
Hathaway infuses some of the needed poignancy here: As she really looks at her life when she talks with her dear friend, who also is Liv's solid brother Nate (charming Bryan Greenberg).
The utter selfishness of the two lead characters just pisses you off so much that you do hope something bad happens to both of them and when such things (and believe me, not nearly bad enough) happen, you won't laugh.
That said, this movie was at its best when it was at its most over-the-top.
I found it pretty good.it's certainly not the movie of the year,but since when a comedy is?The movie is light and there are some funny moments.
I think the movie just shows what some little girls, when kids, were dreaming of.I think, few or many years ago, it was common to see little girls dreaming of it and maybe the movie just shows the audience what was once a dream and now with the society,well the wedding is getting a bit something people forget about,the true goal of it maybe.There might be parts of the movie that married people would find funny as maybe it was their case.
In fact,it's a C-O-M-E-D-Y!Not a big drama or action movie or something like that!I think the acting was good and I personally don't really look at the acting when I watch a movie,I'm more interested about the movie and what's happening than the acting,except if it's a really bad acting like in some movies I saw and forgot the tittle.
That's when the film starts earning its "Bride Wars" title.
I was actually embarrassed to be wearing the bridal gown when the movie was over.
The story follows two BFF (best friends forever) who decided to have a wedding in June at some fancy plaza when they were little girls.
In a time when women aim to run for Presidency and lead social revolutions, this is a real depressing conclusion.
It is obvious that the idea of the movie is to show us how two childhood friends deal with their friendship when their most desired dream seems to come true.
Apparently, if you're a woman and live in Manhattan, the ultimate dream of your life is to get married at the Plaza in June, so when best friends Liv (Kate Hudson with a Paris Hilton/Britney Spears haircut) and Emma (Hathaway) get asked the fundamental question by their beaus, they immediately try to book the right place and date.
Sometimes it's funny to see these girls bitterly attack one another even if we're meant to sympathize, and other times it's disheartening when we're supposed to be laughing.
Sure, there are a lot of great conclusions that you come to when you see what the movie is about, two best friends who are scheduled to marry the same day, from: they're best friends who can't compromise?
Oh when will the madness end?
He was known for putting in good performances even when handed a bad script, but in this disaster, he doesn't even try.
But since there was a time when I first saw Fulci's CITY OF THE LIVING DEAD and just dismissed it as B-movie rubbish (Hey now, don't give me that look -- what did I know back then?
Plus there's a scene that resembles (ok, use the word rip-off if you desire so) another scene from ALIEN a lot (think: when Skerritt goes searching for the alien in the air-ducts, with someone watching his moves on a monitor).
The Italians were the undeniable masters when it comes to horror, especially during the seventies and eighties, but obviously all films couldn't be winners.
I wonder if, back when he was wowing audiences with great performances in films such as Cul-de-sac and The Flesh and the Fiends, Donald Pleasance ever thought he'd be starring in dross like this?
One of the funniest moments in the movie is when the grandmaster, who had murdered his Russian rival, is confronted (again) by Columbo during a chess simul (an event where a strong player plays matches against several players at once).
Although not even a mediocre player would fall into this trap - much less a grandmaster, even when being annoyed - it really is a fitting position for the movie, for undoubtedly, any chess player who commits murder for fear of losing a chess match is a fool indeed!
At moments like this the Columbo character is normally at its best when he puts pressure on his suspect or tries to gain his trust by playing dumber than he of course obviously truly is.
The story isn't the most clever or ingenious ones, at least not when being compared to the best and most memorable Columbo movies but it's a story that doesn't bore and still provides plenty of surprises and entertainment, even though this movie doesn't feature as much comical relief as was the case in some other Columbo movies, which in my opinion is a positive thing.
Harvey, number one at the game only because of the illness of the Russian champion (Jack Kruschen) the year before, panics when he plays a practice match with Kruschen and realizes that this year, he will lose his title.
The "denouement" is one of the few times when an "expletive" is heard in a "Columbo" installment.
This happens all too easily: how does Clayton manage to time it when the cleaning lady is/has been in Dudek's room and how does he avoid being seen?
(2) Columbo can only perfectly test out his theory at the end when Clayton removes his hearing aid?
Meanwhile, Columbo appears before there's even a murder: Dudek's coach had panicked and called the police when the champion didn't show up in his hotel room on time.
I saw this movie when it first aired back in 1972 on ABC movie of the week and I'm trying to get a copy of it as I write this.
I think when Re-runs of the untouchables surfaced it started a wave on that subject matter.
A man is seated in the back quietly, when a soldier sits down next to him.
Finally they are the last two on the bus when they reach a stop.
Made during the `Glory Days' of the ABC Movie of the Week, when they were putting out some real quality TV-Movies (The Night Stalker; Dr. Cook's Garden; A Brand New Life; Congratulations, It's a Boy; Five Desperate Women), this one ranks with the best of them.
Sure there are some little exaggerations(some of the goal, some of the football stunts), but the shivers that one gets when seeing Raul, Beckam, Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Zidane and other football stars giving their best on the pitch is worth every second of it.
I don't remember when i last laugh this much when i saw a movie (might have been when i saw the first goal movie) there are so many errors in this movie that it's impossible not to laugh at it.
The story never really build up, useless extended footage on the pitch, lousy snow cgi, all the blame is put on Gavin Harris when Real did not score, when they have Ronaldo, Raul, Robinho, Baptista (that's already 4 strikers in 1 pitch at the same time), with super playmakers Beckham, Zidane, Graveson, etc.
I usually only go to the cinema when I think its a movie that has at least potential of being good, and this is the first time I came out of the cinema confirming I have just watched a lousy movie.
But good friend and ex-Newcastle player Gavin Harris (Alessandro Nivola) is on hand at the club (reference the first movie shall we) to provide Munez some action, especially when Harris is running afoul with Rudi for his lost form.
A real heartbreaking moment was when he allowed the money and dizzy heights of his new found fame go to his head, and pushed away the lovely Roz.
I watched the first movie when it released in the cinemas, and although it was highly unrealistic (all the chances he miraculously gets), I thoroughly enjoyed it and thought the movie mixed the highs with the lows believably.
Also I watch the Cahmpions league and many of the games from the Spanish league and it doesn't work for me when you actually know what truly happened in those games, for example Madrid lost against Arsenal, and actually didn't get that far in champions that year.
I agree with what many of you have said, the film is a HUGE Adidas commercial and the fact that when the movie came out, many of the players weren't in Real Madrid anymore.
They are all quite attractive, yes, but the attempts to take advantage of that sometimes distracted the movie...to me, inadvertent sexiness has far more impact than when it is shoved in your face.
So successful has he been that, when he rejoin him in Goal 2 - Live The Dream, he has turned his back on the underachieving Geordies and been snapped up by Real Madrid, where he joins up with guest stars David Beckham and Raul.
I could not stop laughing when i saw him in the finals.
After seeing the first i didn't know when the super subs dream was going to end, but at Real Madrid with superstars surrounding him, i thought i was in for a treat.
Santiago Munez (Kuno Becker) has been transfered to Real Madrid, but when you are a rich, spoilt footballer with more money than sense, life doesn't always run smoothly.
To give the first film it's due, it really managed to capture the footballing atmosphere perfectly, and when it slotted fictional characters into the live action, there was a degree of realism about it.
This added more to a sense of realism, as compared to the first movie when Becker was scene doing all sorts of fantastic things -- corny to a trained eye.
It's sad, especially when I'm a giant supporter of independent film, but "The Item" is one movie that shouldn't belong on a video store shelf.
If I have to say something good about this movie is that it taught me when I have to safe my money instead to rent a stupid movie.
The gore factor was pretty good (and when I rent horror, I want gore...unfortunately, I picked this from the 'bore' section).
and even this is somewhat embarrassing - making one feel the same sensation as being in a public place with your father when his low tolerance is becoming blatantly obvious.
I ask myself , what did the producer thought when he was making this crap.
For example, whenever there was a shoot-out, even when all the person had was a pistol, they NEVER reload their guns after firing like mad for five minutes.
Another example would be when a lady attempted to kill a group of people(with a knife an inch long) was shot repeativly as she ran what looked like 30 feet, you think she'd die after getting hit by a combination of bullets of an Uzi and two 9mm pistols.
A gang of grating young criminals (each with 'issues') meet a Rick Moranis-ish scientist in the desert in order to procure the titular character for an Internet client who is promising to deliver a large sum of money (it seems as though they lack common sense when dealing with those junk chain-letters that arrive in the 'ol Inbox).
I've seen so many movies and when somebody who is a movie buff like me throws out the term "the worst movie i've ever seen", that is a comment to be taken seriously.
The daughter is Katherine "Kay" Caldwell(Louise Allbritton, in a creepy performance, eerily photographed throughout the film..she plays Kay as a manipulative sneak, cunning and dangerous)who has a fear of death and is deeply involved spiritually with the occult..she is often referred to, when others are conversing about her, as morbid.
When Frank tries to kill, with a pistol, Alucard for what he's supposedly done to Kay, he is shaken when the bullets go completely through the Count hitting Kay.
anyone who was associated with this abomination as well as anyone who enjoyed it is cordially invited to board the bus for Royal Oak, Michigan for an appointment with Dr. Kevorkian...can't really pinpoint whether it was sicker or stupider than anything i've ever seen...the cover of the film promises something that seems interesting...when you are subjected to the Chinese girl doing her art thing during the beginning credits, you know that's not going to happen...if i had any sense i'd have turned it off at that point...horrible script, poor excuses for acting and an overall mean-spirited attitude make this a candidate for the absolutely worst movie EVER...do yourself a favor...dodge this bullet...
How about the faux tension build up when the team of transvestites arrive (leading to the afore mentioned chase scene).
Yes, there was tons of pointless gore, but there's nothing wrong with that when properly used.
So when a man at the video store said this was the worst film he had ever seen, I had to rent it out.
So imagine my surprise when the monster was shown as a giant "love pump".
My only caveat in the entire film appears early on when Julie Warner appears fully frontally nude.
Fox is doing a great job in the lead, just like he always does.It was while filming this movie when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's.He was only thirty and one year earlier he was still playing a teenager in a movie.That movie was the third part of Back to the Future, where Mike was of course Marty McFly.Now he's doing much less acting, but still he is doing something.Recently I saw him in two parts of Scrubs, where he played Dr. Kevin Casey.He is great playing doctors and whatever.
Her boyfriend is suspicious of the newcomer, and this suspicion turns to jealously when the Count and the heiress are married.
This then turns to tragedy when he accidentally shoots the heiress...
Just a once in a blue moon film but still when watch a great watch :P.
Lu would've known of Ben Stone's arrival in Grady, of where he was staying, and may have planned and had an eye out for when he made his way out of that cabin.
In a later scene when Ben 'walks, runs' to her home late at night, the viewer learns there must be some distance between the two homes.
)Big city Doc finds Love in small town.Lou Looks great in the dress and hat,when she's in the Parade,Definitely Someone I would fall for.Great Characters,Typical Small Town Friendly people.Michael Fox is Great in this Movie.Too Big for a small town doc,But finally Fits in .He realizes He Loves Lou,But Leaves To Hollywood ,But Small Towns are far better Than Large Cities.
My husbands favorite scene is Julie Warner slowing rising from under water when she was skinny dipping.
when she's done, she's all clean, oh well, at least we were spared a shower scene!!
Yes, as many could say, Jimmy Fallon spreads talent all around when he steps on the "SNL" set.
But when he steps on a movie set, I have to tell him: "That's different buddy, you're not doing the same thing you do always" What a mistake they made in telling this guy to act as he always does.
The film is not a shame when it comes to direction; but I just can't understand why Tim Story, after doing a respectable comedy like "Barbershop", got into this.
The opening sceneÂwhere an athletic bike messenger, obviously a stunt double, rushes through the cityÂwill insult anyone's intelligence when the messenger removes his helmet to reveal Latifah herself.
I actually saw this movie on a trans-Pacific flight - first thing I thought, when it came on, was that it merely had the same name as the French Taxi movies I love so much.
Next, when I saw the opening sequence was nearly identical, I started to get worried that the original had been remade and destroyed by Hollywood.
For example: at the end of the movie, when the bad girls remain caught on that unfinished bridge, that exact stunt it's performed in the french version of TAXI (wich was released in 1998) but with one difference: the french one its done much better.
A Action/Comedy/Crime/Thriller about a cop Washburn(Jimmy Fallon,Anything Else) who gets his license taken away so when he gets the call that there is a bank robbery.He jumps in a cab but not just any cab Belle's(Queen Latifa,Chicago)cab.So now he is in for a big surprise.
As you can see in my profile i'm from Belgium so i saw the original version of this movie ( and it rules by the way :-) ) but when i heard that there was going to be remake done of this movie i thought "well maybe it wont be as bad as every other remake" ( cause American remakes of movies are always less then the original ( no offense ) examples: The Grudge, The Ring ) but again i was wrong, choosing girls in bikini's as the bad guys(girls) was a bad mistake same as choosing Queen Latifah as the cab driver and the way that the story is brought on to screen is also really bad, i also thought that a good point would be the car itself cause in the third original TAXI ( TAXI 3 ) the story wasn't that good but the car was one of the plus points, but that doesn't apply to this movie, so i'll give you one last advice : don't go and see this movie but try to get a hand on the original TAXI by Luc Besson and i'll assure you you'll have a great time  greetings from A.V.
Of course, the most shockingly bad scene was in the end, when the car drove off the incomplete highway and landed on a bit that wasn't connected.
Emilien's mother in the French original was a senile old lady, who found her house destroyed when her son left the kettle boiling by accident.
And of course, who could forget the immortal line, when trying to comfort Emilien after failing his attempt to get a driver's licence for the 8th time:  Camille: "Don't worry, Emilien.
I don't know why people should watch this film when it even doesn't take its cues from the original.
I'm not sure either the director, writers, etc etc realized what was at hand when they made this, but they clearly kicked themselves in the butt for this one.
It's also a classic example of what happens when you let lawyers and politically correct groups scare you out of doing things right.
What a surprise it was when the airbags, that deploy instantly in the event of a crash, deployed several seconds after the crash!
Unfortunately, this was a film that looked better in the trailers when the film was being promoted, prior to its commercial release.
Ann Margaret must have been feeling desperate when she agreed to appear in this film as the lush mother of Washburn, but on second thought, it makes perfect sense that with a son like him, drinking is the only way this woman can go through life.
I'm not kidding when I say that this a remake of the three French films since although the film is mainly a poor remake of the the first film, it lifts sequences from the second and third films.
I first saw Quincy just under ten years ago when they showed it on BBC1 in the afternoons.
My first memory was of the cops fainting when Quincy shows them the autopsy in the credits.
One episode springs to mind when they search for a boy who's been hidden underground in the desert, they search everywhere and it's by finding a rare flower that starts them off and finding the boy.
I have enjoyed Quincy for years--both when it first came on TV and in the years following its wide-spread syndication.
I think Quincy was great when it first aired but is reflective of the "Shake 'n Bake" formula of TV in the '70s and early '80s.
I think I would pay real money if for once his boss Asten, Lt. Monahan and everyone else would believe Quincy when he finds something out of the ordinary.
Something like,"Gee Quincy, you were right about all of the last 75 deaths you investigated when I didn't believe you despite considering you my friend.
Jack Klugmans excellent as the coroner with an axe to grind and there's fine support from John S.Ragin and Robert Ito.It always makes me laugh though when instead of just doing autopsies he'll investigate and solve the case the detectives never solve it and I think in one episode Monaghan says Quincy should get a Police pension for all the detective work he does.A slice of classic TV with memorable stories and characters Quincy is well worth a watch.
I miss those days when quincy was shown at TV here in Norway.
First off, when the notion of burning a naked women alive and eating her hits Starker, he is absolutely beaming.
Believing that she is responsible for the death of her family, she has lost the will to live and offers no resistance when tortured by evil Commandant Conrad von Starker (Adriano Micantoni).
And although I imagine the makers never intended to provide any laughs, I defy anyone to not giggle at the moment when Lise is suspended above flesh-eating rats (actually rather disinterested gerbils) or the 'sex' scene between Lise and the doctor, which consists of several minutes of them rolling around together naked, but never actually seeming to bother with any serious boning!
He has quite a few effective moments, particularly when it comes to displaying the supernatural strength of the undead.
I especially resent this type of emotional manipulation when it tries to make a greater statement about our present day criminal justice system through questionable comparisons.
Even more importantly, when do I get my own hovercraft?)
It is sad when critics reach the point where the name of the director automatically insures a positive review.
Through the minds of three precognitive and abnormally gifted youths who, when asleep, dream only of murder in technologically projected second sight, Anderton sees his own criminal fate and sets out to alter his unknown predestination.
Estranged from his wife and a father struggling to cope with the disappearance of his son, Anderton seeks a temporary high in the dark world of illegal street drugs but when his murderous number comes down the pipe, both the law and Precrime chart a course for his apprehension before he kills.
In certain scenes when sympathetic emotional intent is clear, the film's fast paced storyline doesn't give Cruise time enough to shine, or the audience occasion to feel his pain.
In addition to momentum, the story also suffers from certain logical loopholes with regard to the entire concept of "Precrime," leaving many unanswered questions when reflecting back on the plot, which could be interpreted as justification for such a fast paced adrenaline ride.
That's another thing; the precogs only give an ample amount of time to catch these `murderers' when there is premeditation.
In the opening scene, we are explained that when there is no premeditation, there is little time to stop there murders from happening.
Spielberg has the infallible ability to combine mainstream with art when it comes to the medium of film, and this is the one quality which distinguishes him from other directors; and as mentioned above, it's also the reason why his movies are so popular and why he is so highly regarded as a director.
I like that the film is very unpredictable, you really don't know how it will end especially when Anderton is faced with the man he thinks took his son and you wonder if he will really kill the man.
Also, you wonder how Anderton will get out of the situation when everything is against him and you are really left wondering right up to the end of the film how it will be resolved and how Max Von Sydow (Lemar) will be brought to justice, I really enjoyed the twist at the end.
Go get some popcorn when that part comes on, but don't miss the last fifteen minutes.
In fact his loss is his drive in his work, so naturally he can't believe it when the system turns against him.
One day the head of this police department has terrifying shock when the pre-cogs tell him there is going to be a murder and he will be the killer.
Witwer and Anderton come at odds from the beginning and it turns catastrophically worse when the Pre Cogs see a now rare premeditated murder, where the perpetrator is John Anderton.
Basically, when you sit down to watch this movie you have a choice, well if you believe in that.
A movie to really enjoy, both when you watch it and afterwards when it almost is inevitable to think about it.
I watched it when it hit video stores shelves and I regret for not watching it on the theaters.
But when the PreCogs predict that he is going to commit a murder, Anderton has to find out why before he is caught.
This is a movie that requires a lot of concentration, because it's one of those films you have to pay strict attention too, and the plot is seriously awesome, plus one of my favorite moments in the film is when Cruise chases his own eyeballs!.
Chaney is seen as a nice guy monster who many say only works when under a Jack Pierce make-up job or as Larry Talbot.
Frank seems to be loosing his mind as he is arrested for murder when Kay's body is found in a coffin on the plantation.
The best performance besides Chaney and Allbritton has to go to Robert Paige who isn't your stereotypical horror hero, when Kay offers Frank a chance to live forever he all most gives into her.
I've even learned to welcome it when he makes decisions which infuriate me, so long as he makes them with the right kind of self-assured arrogance.
Anderton's mistake is to believe in the value of revenge, and he's never more admirable than when he realises his mistake.
Suffice it to say that when we think we know where the story's going, we may indeed know where the story's going - but Spielberg is only allowing us to see so much of what's coming up in order to obscure the rest of it.)
Only the one chase scene was overdone with Rambo-like mentality of the good guys not getting hit when they should, and vice- versa.
Things get complicated for the future of Pre-Crime when Detective Danny Witwer, played by Colin Farrell, is sent to inspect the operation.
He works with a group of `pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen.
All told, he passes muster, and even more so, when you think of what a hokey disaster someone like John Carradine would have been in the part.
The opening scene went straight to the murdering action and looked totally realistic (the wolf's teeth in the rear view mirror, when the guy in the trucks head falls off - awesome).
The only parts I didn't like was the blur effect when the wolf was on screen.
I had never heard of this movie when I first saw it.
They are all so boring, so stupid, and so poorly acted that you really don't miss any of them when they die.
And of course, there are the campers, who are unaware of what's going on and too stupid to really do much when it does come.
When it dies, it becomes some ugly guy we've never seen before, except when they show it from the side.
There is a scene towards the end, when three survivors are in the cabin, the chick ranger is explaining what the hell is going on (she all of a sudden becomes the expert) but notice her head turning as she addresses the other two survivors.
got even worse near the end when they are attacked by the wolf.
I saw "Son of Dracula" when it was first released and six times over the following months.
When people are dreaming, they don't realize that they are dreaming, but when they wake up, they do know that it was a dream.
BIG spoiler here: The real downer came at the end, when Cheryl was being chased by the crowd, at the head of the pack was the murderer, bent on killing her.
Her tragic and horrible death at the theatre and her second death when her father throws her in the well made Ringu 0: Baadusei an incredible sad story.
Barbara Stanwyck stars as a woman who inadvertently witnesses a murder one night when, awakened by a thunderclap, goes to her window and sees her neighbor in an apartment across the street (George Sanders) strangle a woman to death.
Shaken but collected, she phones the police who respond to the call but are unable to detect anything out of the ordinary when they arrive to question Sanders.
This is a moderately predictable melodrama when crime inspection was more simple somehow.
There's a really beautiful moment when Drac's coffin rises from the swamp, and the man himself materialises from misty vapour, then floats across towards Allbritton, who awaits her husband-to-be on the bank.
He (like Stewart) has nothing to hide when the police (Gary Merrill and Jesse White) show up.
I found this series to be a well crafted and accurate view of a particularly dark time in history when ambition and zealotry brought terrible violence to western Asia.
just the fact that when they finally get to to Jerusalem not only is it not occupied by the people that were supposedly oppressing it (the turks were already kicked out) that in fact everybody was getting along quite well.
The always jovial Terry Jones (Monty Python) hosts this documentary as he travels from England to Istanbul to Jerusalem and beyond explaining the who, what, where, why, and when of the more notable of the many European forays into the Holy Land.
The acting of the Dog, played by Bibo, was stunning, especially when you know that she has received NO formal training whatsoever (and she did indeed act, not react!).
But everything ends in a thud when the resolution of the film is nothing more than the doctors agreeing she is crazy and that's what caused her to murder.
A brief love affair with Heflin's character, who unceremoniously drops her when he gets bored with her, is the catalyst that puts her obsessive schizophrenia in gear.
And Joan was never better than when she was a woman in peril ("Autumn Leaves", "Sudden Fear") or a woman-on-the-verge.
This rash move causes her to get desperate when she senses David's coolness, and then deeply wounded and enraged when he callously ends their affair.
Above all, women could not be told the truth about their condition after World War Two, when they had to be driven out of the factories where they had worked beside men and back into the home to be consumer housewives.
He obviously has strung Louise along for some purpose, and he dumps her when she presses him for a commitment.
Crawford had won an Oscar just the year before for "Mildred Pierce" so she was red-hot when she made this film.
Louise then almost snaps when she learns Carol and David are seeing one another; her odd behavior becomes even odder, telling lies, imagining she was involved in the death of Dean's first wife, etc.
I kept looking at my watch and wondering when is this going to be over?
You have to accept the bubblegum psychology this movie spews out but it might have been something of a groundbreaking film when it came out.
He's unwilling to commit to a serious relationship with Joan at the beginning of the film, but later he sweeps a much younger lady (Joan's step-daughter) off her feet and when confronted admits that much of her appeal is her money!
In the beginning, she seems normal enough but when rejected by Heflin, she shows that there is a strong streak of obsession and delusion about her--and she comes off sounding like a crazed stalker.
Things get pretty dicey after that and this is when Miss Crawford's performance goes from good to brilliant.
Personally, I think he does just fine, particularly during the final scene when he finds his coffin ablaze and rails at Robert Paige's Frank Stanley, yelling "Put it out!
Crawford plays a woman who slowly begins to go mad when Van Heflin breaks up with her.
The director uses sound effects, music and weird camera effects when Crawford's grip on reality starts to loosen.
Things come to an emotionally exciting culmination when Heflin decides to marry Crawford's step daughter played by Geraldine Brooks, which is the last straw for Crawford.
It's hard to buy into her being completely crazy and stumbling around in LA and locked up in a psycho ward, especially if you saw the smile on her face when she pulled the trigger not once, but two times in a chilling scene.
While Van Heflin gives an applaudably callous performance as the insensitive focus of obsession, partially because I cannot understand why such an incredibly ugly man like him so often plays roles of confidently unavailable loners after whom beautiful women obsess, Joan Crawford gives one of those tremendous performances that is almost like a throwback to ancient Greek theater when the protagonist was such an abundant function of the story to the extent that he had to portray every other character and even sometimes the props as well.
It's when Louise is being treated with mind altering and psychotic drugs that she remembers what brought her to this state of insanity and it had to do with her former lover confirmed bachelor and swinging construction engineer and part time piano player David Sutton,Van Heflin, the David that Louis was asking for at the beginning of the movie.
This decision on David's part has Louise go off her nut to the point of almost losing both her composer, when David was around, and her ability to look after her and Davids employers Dean Graham's, Raymond Massey, very ill wife Pauline whom Louise, a licensed nurse, was taking care off.
It took Carol's father Dean to straighten her out on her mothers, and his wife's, tragic death in him being present when she took that one step beyond off the rock and into the lake drowning herself.
It's just when it seemed that Louise had her life straightened out with David gone out of it and Carol accepting her as her mother that things really took a downward turn with David unexpectedly showing up again.
We can only hope with the great advances in mental therapy, since 1947 when the movie "Possessed" was made, and psychiatric studies that what Dr. Willard told Dean Graham turned out to be true.
the architecture of the homes and waterfront cabin speak of a time when things were built with detail, style, and authentic woods.
The moment when he effortlessly flings the jealous Frank Stanley across the room, with a slight movement of his arm, while standing impassively, barely moving, is extremely effective.
If one can get past this implausible plot thread and take the story at face value, this is when the film really takes off, and Crawford's neurosis/psychosis picks up speed.
And that's when Joan takes off - emotionally.
Madness is always best when left undiagnosed, but then it was deemed necessary, and this robs the film of what might have been a perfect ending: Crawford screaming "David!
Wonderful, so he won't have to pay alimony any more, but when she finds one, he discovers he wants her back, says the video jacket.
Matt Dillon is especially good and displays a depth to his acting that had yet to be seen when this was first released.
It is very touching during the ending of the movie, when we learn that her favorite food and color is ***SPOILER*** Clams and also purple ***END SPOILER***.
I'm no snob when it comes to low-budget action films: just a few days ago, I watched "Blast!"
Spoiler (like anyone cares) Note: My favorite scene in this disaster of a film was when the bad girl gets blown up.
Soon enough she's secretly marries Alucard and soon becomes one of the undead when there's a confrontation between Frank and Alucard.
Honigmann is not a name that comes immediately to mind when we think of the world's great documentarians, but this work by the obscure Dutch director may place her in that elite category.
In all cases, a portrait of someone connected to that grave is given, ranging from the Japanese girl who loves the music of Chopin so much she moved to Paris to study the piano, to the woman who at 54 found the love of her life, only to lose it again when her husband died unexpectedly.
The events concerned took place at a time when drastic Provincial budget cuts, designed to overcome many years of budget deficiencies, were making the life of provincial civil servants (government employees) very difficult, and the story broke with the uncovering of a pornographic movie intended to be marketed for their benefit, which had been made with Provincially owned equipment by a group employed to create publicity films for the provincial government.
...Involves a bunch of Quebec actors making an erotic movie called "Porno-Bec".....highlight is when they enter into a private nightclub, which is so private that there is no audience.
I thought "Son of Dracula" was the pits when I was a kid.
In fact, in an early scene he expresses a sort of jerky glee when the local voodoo woman drops dead of a heart attack, so I suppose you could say he's aggressively unsympathetic!
However, all this is thrown for a loop when a couple foreigners see Marlene and recognize her as a "good time girl" they'd met in St. Petersburg, Russia.
But, when he isn't totally convinced, Marlene begins to play both roles.
RenÃ© Clair lost some of his charm when he went to Hollywood, but chances were good that he couldn't lose it all.
The dialog was real, the cinematography dark and brilliant, and whether you believe this is a "chick flick," the characters and interplay involved touch on the very heart of the matter - from many aspects that many men will never understand - when it comes to the power of support that comes from friends - especially women - throughout various stages of their lives.
It was as though all 3 films were made at the same time, I love it when there isn't a horridly noticeable gap between productions, which ruins the feeling you get from the original.
I genuinely found myself cowering in a sense as to what would be around the corner, what would the character see when he/she turned around.
i have watched this film several years back and when i finally landed in a place where there are millions of ofws, i felt compelled to write a review of it even though i believe no one would even bother reading it.
we know that when people argue, especially if it involves someone who is a senior, spectators would tend to keep their mouth shut and retreat to the sides.
The Story is set around Josie and her family, Many years ago - Josie had to leave her family and become a domestic over-seas so she that she could provide money to support her family, when Josies husband dies, Josie returns to her family to take over her job as mother, but when she returns, her family is anything but loving and welcoming.
They are both stubborn, shallow and completely self-centered, except when it comes to their children which, I suspect, is supposed to make us see their true caring personas that are otherwise non-existent.
Both me and my girlfriend we're watching the time during the entire movie, wondering when it would finally end.
when the women write in positively and the men are at best confused by the film...what do you have?
You would think when the actual full-length movie is front of you, the scenes would develop what you see in the commercials.
), the kids are WAY too goody-goody, their friends are annoying, and not one person in the theatre laughed for the entire movie (there were a few smirks when Willis broke down--it isn't supposed to be funny).
The acting was as good as can be expected with such a lousy script and you know a film is in deep trouble when there are THREE occasions where we have voice overs of something we had just heard 10 minutes ago!
And when she does, she goes too far in it.
isn't as big as it would be when they met.
Made during the Second World War, at a time when Universal was producing mostly inferior horrors, this is one of the studio's best efforts of the period, with cinematographer George Robinson's camera prowling the homes, woods and bayous of American South with the surefooted gracefulness of a black panther.
As a struggling single mother, though, it is hard to feel empathy for the rich lady who cries about having to be "responsible for everything" when she lives in a big fancy house, doesn't have to work out of the home, and has a husband who is too much fun.
Seems the issues could have been more obviously painful, but maybe those are the things rich people have to complain about - hard to find reasons when the heros look like Michelle Pfeiffer and Bruce Willis, neither are unfaithful, and they have no money worries, huh?
And I hate when people in movies are supposed to be crying really hard but no tears come out, she did this in this movie.
This movie, although extremely realistic and sometimes strong, shows optimism when two persons realize that above the problems, they still love each other and then decide to fix this marriage.
To be honest, I didn't even remember when this movie came out.
Chaney was a major horror star at Universal, when he was making this film.
There are many great atmospheric scenes to name just a few, when Chaney materializes on the top of a coffin, that has just risen out of the swamp, and when Allbritton passes though the bars to see Paige.
Actually, he was quite good as the impulsive, childlike romantic, but when it came to the arguments and the serious displays of resentment, he played the scenes too harshly, almost commando style.
all she does in this movie is walk around looking bored just like i was when i watched this pile of crap.i own a lot of her movies and they are all b movies but at least they had some cool fight scenes in them.if you are a martial arts fan avoid this no matter what.i'm still mad i wasted 4 dollars to buy this DVD
Producer Carl Laemmle Jr changed history of horror cinema when he hired director Tod Browning to make the first official adaptation to Bram Stoker's classic novel "Dracula".
"Son of Dracula" takes place decades after the first film, when the Dracula's story is now considered a mere myth.
However when I saw that the movie had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I just had to watch the film.
Although I do like NIGHT VISION, it is very much a 'B' movie and after Forster appeared in Quentin Tarantino's JACKIE BROWN a lot of people, me included, thought QT would resurrect Forster's career the same way he had done for John Travolta and Bruce Willis when they appeared in PULP FICTION.
But at least they turn good in the end when they help the two nail the Video Stalker's crooked cop partner.
He even manages to engage a little audience sympathy when constantly rejected by the virtuous heroine, a fact that also provides a little character motivation, unusual in a picture of this type.
Adverse to publicity and never allowing a photo, Thomas Woodbury/John Bard (Robert Warwick) is seen only briefly on screen when he is shown going for a hidden weapon as Drew arrives at his estate home to force a confrontation.
The film's most interesting scene occurs when aviator Tony literally crash lands his plane into the home of Miss Jerry Foster (Sally Eilers).
The plot of the movie gets muddied when William Drew asks his ranch foreman Steve Nash (Bogart) to bring Bard to the ranch unharmed.
There's some well-placed humor in the film, such as when O'Brien lands his plane in a lady's bathroom (!
For example Dre looks in his twenties when he has only just finished high school.
So obviously this little film caught my interest, way back when Stop and Shop (as you can tell I'm a New Englandah), had movie rentals!
But I was none-the-less shocked when I caught 2001's "Jacked" on Black Starz last night.
I didn't expect much when I first saw this movie.
I think that people who are have seen the film and think that it is haphazard are the same people who didn't understand Pulp Fiction when it came out.
But when the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs seeks his advice Pitka sees his chance.
Because when you think about it, it is quite bad.
I thought he died when he was touring with Kid Rock.
when I saw the trailer for the love guru I thought it would be a somewhat bad movie compared to what mike myers provided in austin powers, but I saw an early screening today (mainly because I saw my fav and one of the best stand up comedians out there, Daniel tosh, the dude with the cowboy hat) and I was impressed.
I like when I go see a movie and expect something bad and come out pleasantly surprised and the love guru did just that.
If anybody gets a chance to see an early screening you should def go, if not then go when it officially is released.,
If you like wait a few months and it will be out on DVD... People on here take these movies these days way to serious I remember when going to see a movie was supposed to be fun, not always on IMDb.com, lol Have Fun.
But his latest Guru Pitka went too far when he thought of writing it down; in comparison, his Beatnik poet Charlie from So I Married An Axe Murderer (1993) was a character of multi-layered nuance, and more importantly, one that people would much rather watch.
Hey, I like Dumb Humor Â when it's done right.
The rest of the atrocity is filled with other dodgy names like Coach Cherkov and Dick Pants, as well as alleged jokes about snot balls and nose hairs, humping elephants, food prepared to look like genitals, and buckets of urine Â all of which probably would have sounded funny in 1988 in the writers' brainstorming sessions in the SNL offices at 3am when you're doped up on caffeine, but I honestly can't believe that a 45-year-old man wrote this crap down in 2008 and thought this would be funny in any other circumstances.
Some have tried to point out the satire in Pitka's self-help philosophies, but satire only works when it makes a point, and doesn't just appear indistinguishable from the targets it's allegedly satirizing.
The Love Guru, when I saw the trailer, I wasn't exactly laughing, but it was Mike Myers, the clever man who has brought us Austin Powers and Wayne's World, I had to have hope.
Well, Mike Myers, I have no choice, I really wanted to slap the heck out of him when I was watching this painful movie.
Now there was a decent audience in the movie theater, like twenty something people, I did not hear one laugh, seriously, I even kept sighing, wondering when this movie was going to be over.
Now, I hate it when people call movies racist without even thinking what the movie is supposed to be, but you know what?!
The Love Guru is quite possibly the worst film I have ever seen and once I'm done writing this review I am going to crawl into bed and cry as I remember So I Married an Axe Murderer and the times when Myers could do no wrong (thanks for the Wayne's World callback Mike, you actually made me realize how inferior this film is more).
Had the gags been separated and shown on a TV skit show, I might be calling them genius, however, when you string them together with the only common denominator being that the same characters are used, it gets old fast.
Then I saw this movie on late-night TV, you know when almost every local channel ran movies on the weekend.... and I thought it was poor.
Jim Carrey and Robin Williams are two other talented, over-the-top funny men who do some of their best work when they show restraint and don't play themselves.
As someone who frequently reads reviews, I find that it is thrown around far too often, especially when there are so many bad movies out there.
I'm bemused that Meyers would think Americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny, especially when I didn't find it funny and I'm a Canadian.
Comedy is funniest when it seems to come naturally out of the material, but everything seems so forced and strained here.
It's bad enough when a comedy can't generate any laughs, but it gets even worse when you start feeling sorry for everyone up on the screen.
You want to ask them and their agents what they were thinking when they signed up.
Then there's all the jokes we've seen in previous Myers films that aren't so funny the 4th time around when they appear in this flick.
The only time i enjoyed the movie at all was when they were on screen.
I first saw this Three Stooges short when I bought the Three Stooges Collection Vol.
"Then seeing it again for the first time in years some time in 1986.This time that I'd first seen it it was also after school & when it was too snowy out to go to my C.C.D.Class.Curly's Skunkskin cap is another interesting & hysterical aspect to give good color to this picture.
I was laughing other than this too when Curly had even said to Larry "This Fish looks like Moe."
"You've just got to see the rest of it to understand & enjoy it for yourself also including when they're told by the Indians that they had until sundown to leave.They used the cabin for their scenery for "Uncle Tom's Cabin.
"The film concludes when they use a part of the stage's scenery for a sail @ the end when the girls are being chased by the Indians & have to hop onto the stage coach with the wind blowing the stagecoach away.Coitainly Stephen "Steve" G. Baer a.k.a.
Also call me a tad morbid, but when Sylvester nonviolently tried to commit suicide I found myself laughing.
They never show what happened to Sylvester, but when he returns, he's changed physically and looks completely traumatized (his fur is white and looks aged, he's not shivering anymore, and his eyes are dilated and with a lost look).
Quite funny scenes of Porky just being nonchalant almost the whole way when weird things happen behind his back.
It's a classic example of the human mind conjuring up far worse scenarios when the details are left to the imagination.
This movie isn't worth renting, I rented it when it first came out on DVD what a waste of 4.50 this movie is someones idea of a sick joke.
Picture starting to watch a movie have way in, because thats what it feels like when you start watching this, They don't explain a god dam thing.
However, it just goes to show what sloppy direction can lead when the concept of creation comes into effect.
I guess I am one of the few who got to see this film, considering I was the only one in the theater when I watched it.
Steinbeck shows here and there a great latent insight into the human condition in general; his empathy his real, and one truly senses that he at times truly loves his characters; but when it comes to particulars he falls down, and in the end has little to say.
Meredith rises to the occasion when the dialogue goes poetic, redeeming himself somewhat in the process.
A previous comment said something to the effect of an observation that cliches riddle certain parts, but I think it's important to note that this was written in the 1920s, when perhaps those cliches were not quite so pervasive.
If her mother was that bothered, why did she never get suspicious when Jack Friar (S L J) never returned???
Being one half of a gaming couple who met online I tend to get impatient when all gaming females and males are portrayed in the same way.
It was a pleasant surprise as I had no idea what to expect when I went to see it.
It's a funny, bittersweet film about the small things in life, things which seem like a big deal when they happen.
While attempts to convey 'in-game' actions using silhouettes almost work, there are a few moments when the cardboard cutouts on screen seek only to remind the viewer that Hollywood would never make a movie like this.
It seems that the new girl is in fact a witch and is investigating all the evil occurrences until one night when 13 students are locked in the school and they have to escape or die trying from those trying to summon the devil.
She gains respect from her fellow pupils when she confesses to being a witch, when she performs curse on a hated teacher and it works.
However it all changes, when the teacher actually turns up in a very severe accident.
Always watch a couple of episodes at once because of that reason Ignoring that it is a typical British comedy that will lighten you up when you are feeling down.
I had heard so much hype about it that when I finally saw the first episode, I expected to be laughing to the point of tears.
Even then, the gross-out is so poorly done when compared to shows such as South-Park or Family Guy in which disgusting scenes are used in context and with intelligence.
I remember being rather excited about this show when the railers first appeared, even rushing out of the room whenever they came on as to not spoil the clips through over-saturation.
This all seemed painfully ironic when after five minutes of the first episode I saw the same sketch, in a marginally different location, then another, and another.
I especially like the character Vicky Pollard, her role is so perfectly written and when Matt plays Vicky he brings a certain credibility to the role.
David and Matt are just so sincere when the play them.
Well perhaps I am miserable but thats why I watch a lot of comedy and I cannot ignore the political agenda when its drilled in to me.
Im also sure these two can write much better comedy and when they do I will happily write a glowing review.
Emily Howard and Florence are two ladies going about their ladylike business, like any other normal ladiesÂ  Everything stops when high society Harvey wants bitty.
Not always laugh-out-loud but constantly in your face, will keep you amused for a long time, especially when they pop up in your thoughts in everyday situations and trust me they will.
Less a problem are contrivances like the small flea power dust storm emitted when Burgess Meredith (as George) examines his bunk.
Most are of the characters are very funny, but even some of the funny ones lose their punch when you see the same characters episode after episode.
I saw this series when it first premiered in 2003, and I really liked it!
Her mom announces the evening event through a loud speaker and becomes associated when the man who plays the films.
Persuaded to help her look after her fish while she has to inevitably get detained by the authorities, Dabing thought that he had reached seventh heaven when her apartment turned out to be one huge home theatre.
It's strength also came from the wonderful cast who brought their likable characters to life, and you cannot find better chemistry between the cast members even when some of them take up the same characters albeit for different age groups.
Seven years ago, when I was in high school, I was assigned to read and study John Steinbeck's 1937 novella, "Of Mice and Men", in my English class, and it's no surprise that I still remember it clearly now, as it's not a story to forget.
There are times when the score doesn't fit the scene very well, and there may be certain other slight flaws, but they are far from enough to ruin the movie.
I'm not entirely sure why I passed on this film when it landed in my city.
We understand things will get complicated since Dabing and Ling Ling did not recognize each other when he was smacked with the brick.
The film shows them most of the time when they are around six years old.
Both things do not really matter, but show how hard it is to make the right choices, especially when you direct a film for the first time.
Before i watched this movie i did not think it was going to be very funny,but when i did see i laughed almost all the way through.
There may have been possibly one time when I laughed, but thats it.
We believe George when he says Lenny is like a big child.
A scene that surprised me was when Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens play a very small part at Yankee Stadium.
Some of the most standout funny scenes include a bizarre male-prostitute car-scene, the gut-burstingly funny scene in the plane, and when Buddy and Dave go on a terrible, morally unethical (yet damn funny) scene in which they kick the crap out of a bunch of Monks.
The first is when Candy's dog is put down.
One day when he is on a plane, he is accused of "assulting" a flight attendant and racist marks, despite the situation actually being the opposite.
You can feel their frustration with their current situation, the anguish they feel about how they got to this point, and the elation they feel when imagining their future.
His methods are tested to the limit when outlaw Frank Brand (Rod Taylor in a surprisingly sadistic performance) and his gang rob the local bank.
I've yet to see Bob Steele in any of his Westerns where he comes across as such a dominant character, even when he's portraying a villain as he does here.
It would have been much more powerful for George to reveal his intent when he finally finds Lennie at the pre-arranged meeting place in the swamp.
In 1994 when Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was released many in the acting establishment felt the film to be unacceptable.
Ray Finkle), when Ace takes a trip to nearby Collier County to meet with Finkle's parents he discovers the revenge and hate Finkle had for Marino and the dolphins after missing that critical field goal in the Super Bowl.
"I came here to confess, I was the second gunman on the grassy knoll" ... "That's what turns me on about you, your attention to detail ..." and when he meets Ray Finkle's parents.
I also think the plot is good, at least I didn't figure it out when I saw the movie for the first time!
Other actors fade into insignificance when confronted by Carrey's comic genius.
There is little attempt to make the 'plot' at all logical, but that hardly matters when you can't stop laughing.
I saw "Shaun of the Dead" 10 years after Carrey's vehicle; that was another time when I laughed myself silly.
So when he gets the call for duty, he's all over the case.
I miss the Dumb and Dumber/Mask era, when Carrey was in his prime and never took himself or his audiences too seriously.
Its when the Miami dolphins have there mascot snowflake taken and by circle of gossip he finds himself looking for a bottle-nosed dolphin.
its a great movie too watch any day of the week.Even when your feeling low it'll get you up!!!
At the moment when Jim Carrey started butt-talking, my dad shouted out: "Lee, he's crazy!"
I really laughed hard when I went to see this in theatres ten years ago, and while I am smart enough to know how crude, silly, and infantile THE MOVIE ITSELF really is, I can't deny that I still laugh a lot.
I first saw this movie when I was in high school, and I remember that I would ditch school and go to the theater to see it and I would laugh hysterically until my sides hurt every time I saw it.
Did anyone not laugh when he was `testing' the food at Ron Kamp's I'm-the-richest-man-in-the-universe party and stuck his tongue out at that poor guy next to him?
this is another of John Steinbeck's novels brought to the screen.i thought it was well done.Burgess Meredith plays George,and Lon Chaney Jr.plays his travelling companion Lenny.Lenny is what you would call very slow and George has too look out for him and keep him out of trouble.he is a giant of man with the intellect of a child.the two men are forced to keep moving when George does get into trouble.they arrive at a ranch,and end up working.George has big dreams for the two of them.this movie is whimsical in tone at times,but also dark and tragic.Chaney is brilliant as Lenny.the dialogue is very good as is the direction.for me,Of Mice and Men is a 10/10
So I looked forward to seeing this when it was shown on TCM a few days ago.
The funny parts are Alec guinness's eccentricities, Especially the dancing when he is arrested by the police and also his house on the pier itself, So funny to see him pacing up and down in his LITTLE house quite literally up and down.
What do you do when famous people come in here?"
One sequence, where he tries to run a dance hall at the end of the pier and is merrily strutting his stuff on the dancefloor with some local hottie when the authorities arrive to complain, is particularly memorable if only for the mad grin on Guinness' face as he boogies.
Chaney is no restrained and measured Dustin Hoffmann, and when he is playing someone retarded, he flaunts it, and blurts it.
The IMDB plot summary erroneously makes it sound like it is Noah Taylor's movie, when Fairuza Balk is the central character.
For example, when the grieving Candy rolls onto his stomach following the execution of his faithful dog, we don't see the usual intact wardrobe.
So when Lennie throttles the trollopy Mae after caressing her hair, events play out in tragic fashion.
Field looks the part of Mae, the cheap dame with dreams of Hollywood, but she's also stagey as heck, with one of the shrillest voices on record, such that It's almost a perverse relief when she gets throttled.
Aside for the technical merits (it has been rightfully noted this was a lower budget movie), the themes explored here cut to the core of what it means to be human (pursuing beauty and truth while in a POW camp), what it means to practice forgiveness when revenge is exploding within you, and what it means to love without regard to one's allegiances.
Or perhaps it might inspire us to rise above a Rambo-like response when faced with injustice.
It simply took a tough teaching like loving one's enemy and showed what that might look like when humans do their best to apply that lesson.
It also shows that when human beings act selfishly, they lose hope and end up destroying one another.
But when we act with sacrificial love toward each other, not only do we stand a better chance of living, we also keep from becoming savages.
I remember the moment, when they helped the injured Japanese, when I realized that "To End All Wars" was not so named as reference to the WWI slogan, but as subtle hint that the only way we, as a race, will ever outgrow war is when we all realize that we are truly killing our brothers and when we understand that the wars will cease.
The weakness of Lennie is that he is very slow to anger, but when he does you don't want to be in his way.
sometimes we get caught thinking 'why would he do that' when a character commits a particularly selfless act, and I think that is a big part of the writer's intent.
The movie is all the more amazing when you consider it is based on a true story.
I had never heard of the film To End all Wars when I picked it up at my local library because it looked like a good popcorn kinda war movie and had one of my favorite actors in Robert Carlyle.
George relates that he has known poor Lenny for some years, and that the reason for the big man's mental state is the result of being kicked in the head by a mule when a kid.
Curly is especially tough when it comes to any underlings, who rely on their meager, little jobs with even smaller wages.
She screams and when Lenny tries to silence her, he inadvertently uses his super human strength and Mae winds up dead.
I stumbled across To End All Wars when it was shown recently on one of the Starz/Encore channels.
Just a couple of questions though: The genie's arm-cuffs disappeared when he was freed; why is he wearing them again now?
and Why does the genie spend all his time around Aladdin now when he didn't want to be tied down at all?
Even when Jafar completely forgives him, and appears to have won him back, Iago, without cause or reason, SETS FREE the genie and is ultimately the one who kills Jafar.
Yes, Dan Castellaneta Does Excellent with Homer Simpsion in the Simpsions but hes no Robin William when it comes to the gene.
My favorite part in the movie is when Abis Mal wishes for things that Jafar takes literally (and on purpose, which what makes it so hilarious) and finally Abis Mal realizes he'll never get what he wants until Jafar gets what HE wants.
I don't know what people mean when they say the acting was bad.
The story is simple: After the ordeal in the Cave of Wonders, the black lamp somehow emerges, and Iago breaks free of the lamp, is tired of Jafar's orders, and dumps the black lamp into the well and sets out for Agrabah, where Aladdin is attacked by Razoul and the guards (again; hey, he had been trying hard to be sultan when something came to mind, didn't he?).
They get attacked (including Genie, disguised as Aladdin LOL), and just when things get hopeless, Iago grabs Jafar's lamp, and even though he's hurt by Jafar, he lets go of the lamp, which falls into the lava, destroying Jafar for good.
After looking at the animation, it wouldn't be hard to come to the conclusion that the animators were drunk when they made this awful movie.
Most of the music is forgettable at best, and when a song is half right decent, what puts me off about it is that it doesn't sound Indian or Aladdin-esquire at all.
I know, in a film, you're supposed to suspend your disbelief, but when is enough enough?
The twins are fantastic shots when hanging upside down from twisted rope while spinning and wearing ski masks.
It looks cool when a man opens his overcoat to reveal a vest with 6 holsters, each containing a badass looking handgun in slow-motion.
Just when you think the movie's going to laugh at itself ("THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT!!!!!!!
For example you might say to yourself, how are these guys with so good at killing when they have no experience and their basic attack plans involve standing in the center of rooms surrounded by bad guys with only a handgun in each paw and some cool sunglasses.
Another question you might ask is why is the Willem Dafoe character gay when it's obvious that writer/director Troy Duffy knows even less about gay people than I do?
A little of Rocko goes a long way, and I felt cheated when he wasn't given a slow, painful death.
How did Billy Connelly become such a feared hitman when his method of whacking a guy involves standing in the middle of the street in broad daylight with a bunch of guns under his trench coat and waiting to be seen before firing.
Those wacky Weinstien brothers - when they're not frequenting bars looking for the next Quintin Tarantino or Kevin Smith, they're buying Oscars (I'll never forgive them for robbing Saving Private Ryan of Best Picture).
THe film reaches its sad low-point when Dafoe's uselessly gay character (why?
actually they are worse than a student film... when i was in film school people actually knew what they were doing.
Like dogs, these men were faced with the scary prospect of some day being of no more use, and there was no system in place to take care of them when that day came.
Its a sad day when people think that Matrix movies and this refuse are excellent action films.
A number of people seem to have picked up on this aspect of the movie and thus dubbed it similar to Pulp Fiction (though no one mentions Reservoir Dogs) when this movie takes non-linear storytelling to a level beyond where Quentin Tarrantino was ever able to go.
I still fail to see how others consider this movie vacuous and without meaning, when its message about the pitfalls of our current legal system and the need for something that transcends it is quite clear.
In real life, there is a significant amount of blood when someone is shot in the head.
What a great scene when Lennie and Crooks are in his room talking about being lonely And no happy ending like most movies, made it seem more the real.
This film had the sad history of being blackballed in the United States due to the incident at Columbine...which is a real shame, because it is a treasure...written and directed by Troy Duffy, Boondocks is set in Boston...it is the story of fraternal twin Irish boys (Connor and Murphy McManus) who work in a meat packing plant...when their friend, Doc, is being stiff armed by the Russian Mafia, the boys and their friends step in to help...and away we go!
Any life the movie has is supplied by him, and quite frankly, its really boring when he's not on the screen.
The action and resulting end are as applicable today as they were when the movie was released.
Years from now, when Freeman likely will get some AFI tribute or something or lifetime achievement on TV, Street Smart might be neglected among his most famous parts but shouldn't be.
And the other scene which is the best in the movie from an acting point of view involves the characters of Morgan Freman and Kathy Baker, you will know what scene I mean when you see it.
Fast Black had killed him when he complained, and threatened to report him to the cops, that the service that he was getting was far below what he was paying for!
***SPOILER ALERT*** It's when Fisher has nothing to lose, but his life and the lives of his loved ones, that he decides to take Fast Black on.
The trouble comes in when some readers believe the article is about one particular real pimp (Freeman) who happens to be on trial for murder.
Kathy Baker is wonderfully appealing (and sexy) as Punchy, one of "Fast Black"'s girls; she shines in all of her scenes, especially when she's relating to Fisher the comedic account of her first ever trick.
This movie can show what happens when you "create" a story and you do it TOO well.
I mean, did the director of this "film" consult any actual scholars when creating this debacle?!
I saw at Marchiano's website that he is making "The Gospel According to John" -again word for word-entirely by his own ministry when they manage to get 250000 people to donate $100 each-how I wait for it!
Having watched this film recently has encouraged me to want to watch Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ" when it comes to Singapore next month.
One, for instance, is when Jesus and his buddies play under a waterfall like a bunch of kids.
Another is when they all decide to have a little wrestling brawl just to be goofy.
His world gets turned upside down when two vampires, Rachel and Angie, get thrown into the mix.
He's not completely awful, but he sticks out when compared to the rest of the cast.
I remember being happy when she married Fred MacMurray who was another favorite of mine.
In 1947, when it came out, I was 13; I didn't see it again until 1975 or '76, when it was shown on TV, and I watched it with a young woman in her early 20's.
I am a huge fan of James Glickenhaus, and when I saw this film for sale I snagged it, and let me tell you, from the cover it looked like a second rate tele movie, but it is stylish and intelligent.
I remember when it was on cable years ago my young nephews loved the boy in this movie because he rode a dirt bike.
"Manos" the Hands of fate, Plan 9 form Outer Space, Monster-A-Go-Go, or even House of the Dead....Trust me when I tell you that you do not know real pain until you have seen the thankfully almost unknown Night of Horror.
I can tell you of only one slightly entertaining thing about this flick....a lens smudge It is by far the highpoint in the film and when it went away I was sad to see it go.
So when I found out there was another movie called "Night of Horror" which was supposedly the original film that "Curse of the Screaming Dead" was based on I was a little giddy.
First off if you're going to make a movie, learn how to light the damn thing, when there was a light it looked like someone had gotten a giant spotlight and set it down in front of the camera.
Originally, when "Ricco The Mean Machine" came out on VHS in America, it was an edited version, but the 2006 DVD release put all the footage back into it that makes it a violent, brutal movie.
Ricco infiltrates the gang with the help of an old friend (Eduardo Fajardo of "The Mercenary") who turns out to be pretty treacherous and his new girlfriend Scilla (Barbara Bouchet) who likes to hustle guys with her cleavage when she is trying to exchange funny money for genuine green.
Gaspara is not as lucky when the fourth gunman delivers a coup de grace to the him and blasts away his noggin.
One interesting scene occurs about half-way through the movie when Ricco and Scilla rob two guys carrying protection collection money gathered by the Vito mob.
This movie was made when it was fashionable to zoom and pan with film cameras.
The climax is a shoot-out at Don Vito's factory with Ricco seeking revenge when those he loves are slain in horrific gang-land style fashion.
He also kisses like a fish, rolls on the ground with his sister and her boyfriend because they're too happy to see him out of prison, feigns laughter when he nearly evades car accidents, blinks in close-up when he recognizes his mother and sister's dead bodies (that's emotion for you), heck he even karate chops people in a flashback to impress his father.
He owns a soap factory, says stuff like "don't you know by now I hate soap... and men that sweat" and turns his own men into it when they fail him.
Refer to the previous paragraph for what happens when you have a sex scene with her.
The first half of the movie is so delightfully cheesy that I kept wondering where's Joe Bob Briggs when you need him.
It certainly isn't love at first sight when two restaurant employees meet each other on a rainy night.
But when they accidentally kill a crazed hitch hiker and hide her corpse, they discover murder is a mutual aphrodisiac and fall head-over-heels in love.
However, their sex-life only properly functions when the blood of innocent women is shed and thus they start a vagina-stabbing killing spree across the city.
Things get even more out of control when the shy cook turns into a unstoppable psychopath who goes out vag-stabbing all by himself.
in order to fuel their sex life, but, when the chef eventually decides to go solo on his murder sprees, their bizarre relationship begins to crumble.
One night, their worlds collide when they have a run-in with an insane hitchhiker (whose bizarre performance rivals that of Edwin Neal in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as far as insane hitchhikers go).
Terribly scared of their misdeed, they develop a sexually romantic relationship, though it seems to only spark when they commit murder...
The guy acquires a predilection for vaginal evisceration and his girlfriend seems to like it when he sixty-nine's chicks.
A surly waitress sort of befriends (or dominates) an introverted pastry chef at the restaurant where they work, and when she coerces him into giving her a ride home in a rain storm, they encounter a young girl in the rain who is apparently insane & uses the convenient icing knife in the back seat to slice herself open.
OK, well, hubby is so taken with his new hobby he begins to set out on his own and select victims, even in broad daylight, and when SHE finds out, she's of course jealous & wants to join in the fun.
At a time when many other pinky films dealt with sleazy subject matter in a more "fun" and tongue-in-cheek manner, ASSAULT!
Homegirl starts to get a little to clingy and jealous when she realizes that he's been doing some "moonlighting" on his own.
She isn't lost for long when things don't work out.
The film has playful aspects of a woman who is planning a revenge on her boyfriend a week when he returns back to Paris.
I can't comment on the score or soundtrack, because it was still incomplete when I saw it, but Mr. Savage does a superb job, and the story and writing are both well thought out and interesting.
I saw a screening of this movie in Tucson, Arizona, and have been watching Amazon to see when I would be able to buy it.
His first lead is a mass-market statuette of a terrified woman, the screaming mimi, sold by the first victim the day she was murdered... Argento changed many details in the process of turning "The Screaming Mimi" into The Bird With The Crystal Plumage, but the most important is this: flawed and weak though he may be, Brown's protagonist is afraid of the universe of madness glimpsed when he gets close to Yolanda Lang.
Ekberg, an exotic `dancer' who writhes about suggestively in an act with bondage overtones, is visiting her sculptor-stepbrother on the California coast when she's almost knifed by an escapee from a nearby asylum, whom the brother promptly shoots dead.
This girl was not a bad actress, she was a non actress, as evidenced when asked to do her hilariously awful 'sexy' nightclub routine.
I am serious when I say this is one of the only movies I have seen that made me physically ill.
The vignettes, when not repetitive, are just plain dumb.
He used to be funny and there are times when he still has funniness within his grasp.
The movie fails to include one of the most important parts of the story, which is included in the Seder service for Passover, which Jews celebrate every year: after the Hebrew people were freed, and they are in the midst of their rejoicing, God basically yells at them and says "How can you be joyous when my children have died?"
Then listen what happens when the title card of the film's composer comes up.
By 1983, when Jerry made this movie, the last film he directed, many people had written him off, I think.
In any event, the movie escaped my attention when it came out.
I came across it in a movie rental store when I needed a number of movies to get me through a post-operation recovery when I was stuck at home sometime in early '90s.
several parts I like are the Restaurant scene, the waitress when she takes his order, it's hysterical.
Although Hollywood video used to rent the edited versions of the film, I guess they stopped when they realized that kids could rent them (in all honesty the covers do no justice to the graphic content).
That's a shame because when you've seen that part you should see the all the next parts as well to get the big picture.
The movie goes on and on, never offering any climax moments or interesting facts, until the constrained ending when informations about the facts and the persons involved are given like a policial report.
The one in the very beginning and the last, with the made-to-be hit "when you believe", are very fine; but the one with the priests is completely strange to the movie's mood.
It really gives you an idea of what can happened when you least expect it.
It all started when Michelle Brown (the victim) walks into the loan office were Connie worked, with a skirt on that Connie liked.
In the end all I can say to her is that, "Hey when you've layed around your whole life, you don't just get to say one day, "Oh I think I want what everybody else has worked so hard for their whole life".
Anyone who commits this type of crime should be given harsher penalties otherwise, when they are released, they may just do it again.
Being scared when you see someone commit a crime against you is not going to stop criminals.
But when she gives away all of her personal information to a depressed drug user in need of money named Connie (Annabella Sciorra), her entire life falls apart.
Back when we had morals in society, a man & a woman alone on an island for 7 years that were not married to each other was a big scandal.
It is 1) unrealistic that Irene Dunn, missing at sea for seven years, should reappear on the very day that husband, Cary Grant, has succeeded in having her declared dead and then, moments later, remarried in the same courtroom and 2) that Grant's mother would not have attended the wedding; presumably the writers needed Dunne's mother-in-law to be in when Dunne (who naturally would not have known about the new wedding so would have no reason to attend and try to stop it) resurfaced though a little thought could have solved this.
Halfway through the movie he discovers that Dunne was not alone when she was rescued from the island.
In My Favorite Wife,a stand out scene was when Grant 1st sees Scott on the diving board.
Movie moves into high gear when Nick (Cary Grant) sees his first wife as the elevator door closes in the hotel on the way to the honeymoon suite with his bride and he's on the spot to break it to his new bride but then finds out his wife was stranded with a hunk of an anthropologist (Randalf Scott).
Further complications ensue when it's disclosed that Ellen was not alone on the island and that her companion was an athletic Adonis named Stephen Burkett, of course a bachelor.
The ending is obvious from the beginning, but there are some hilarious set pieces along the way, in particular, when Ellen recruits a timid shoe salesman to impersonate Stephen and also when her ruse is exposed as the real Stephen pops up from the country club swimming pool.
However, when Grant finds out she was stranded along with the handsome Randolph Scott (FYI--he really was Cary Grant's best friend in real life), Cary isn't sure whether to get remarried or return to Dunn!
The one failing of both these films however is the character of Bianca, she is such a tragic figure when you think about it, she's neither nasty, vulgar, cruel, malicious or evil.
I hate to say anything bad about a film like this, but when there are so many similar films and I have seen a lot of them, it's easily to make comparisons and nit-pick.
The plot can only thicken when Nick finds out that Ellen wasn't alone on that island for 7 years, but she had company in the shape of a very athletic (and very single!)
Here it uses the well known fact that Cary Grant and Randolph Scott lived together for a number of years when Grant was between marriages as "bachelors."
Adding to the mix are the two children Ellen left behind when they were still infants.
Cary Grant was a master of this type of comedy, and the film's screenwriter and producer is Leo McCarey, who began his career making Laurel and Hardy shorts (when McCarey directed the Marx Brothers in Duck Soup, he took the title from a 1927 L & H short; Groucho considered him the only first-class director the Brothers ever had).
He is perfect as the husband who's life is out-of-control when his wife returns the same day he's had her declared dead.
Things get worse and worse when they get deeper and deeper into trouble when more facts slowly surface.
Cary Grant's comedic flair shines as always, even when he's mugging for Garson Kanin (a director who should have stuck to writing).
But, as usual with her movies, it is Irene Dunne who makes this almost unwatchable, particularly in close-ups, when her ever-visible tongue threatens to flop out of her usually open mouth.
Dunne is very funny, posing as a southern friend when she meets Bianca, and also is quite touching when she first sees her children.
And poor Bianca comes off like a villain when she's a victim.
Although his role doesn't permit him to display the jaw-dropping physical prowess that was showcased so remarkably in THE AWFUL TRUTH, Grant's mastery of internal comedy is given ample screen time here - especially in the final two-third when he discovers he may have a romantic rival.
The resulting complications are the stuff of a classic screwball farce and when the husband is Cary Grant and the wife is Irene Dunne and the writers are Sam and Bella Spewack you know you have a winner on your hands.
Another factor comes into play when Grant learns that Dunne spent several years on the desert island with hunky Randolph Scott.
Cary Grant gets himself into an unwitting romantic pickle when he's confronted by his thought to be long dead wife on his honeymoon with his new bride.
Cary Grant's facial expression on the elevator when he first sees Dunne after 7 years is so memorable that I can still remember it 35 years after first seeing it.
Remarkable to think that Ms. Dunne was over forty when this was made.
Film is missing the enticing depths of real-life when it opts for the conformist teenage boy's supposed 'dream woman' - mass-media-fostered - over a greater variety of people and appearances, as one encounters in actual reality.
The insidious wryness seems completely blunted by the end, when the couple are finally reconciled.
Okay, let me start with the bold statement that everybody is wrong when it comes to the supposed "best of anime," namely, Ghost in the Shell and Akira.
now, i know this isn't a very good title, but its fun to watch when you get the chance.
Since then I've learned a lot about this movie, how it was made, and when.
If you keep this in mind when you watch, it is in fact a terrific achievement, and a testament to the drive of young minds.
To think that this movie was made when the Linn's were in high school blows me away.
I'll admit, the acting isn't the best, but being at the same age as they were when they made this, I've seen in my own movies what limitations you have.
Identical twin-filmmakers Michael and Marc Linn made this film when they were 15 and 16 years old, and think this film is more a rip-off than a parody of the _Indiana Jones_ films, the end credit actually says "based on...") but _Indiana Jed_ is full of youthful inspiration in the all-teenage cast.
Grogan's weakness when he was around the evil Poten was something unusual for a character played by Charles King.
At a time when white actors would don costumes and wear makeup to appear as another race, Shadow of Chinatown used real Chinese actors.
First off the serial is constructed like one of the annoying horror mystery films from a few years earlier when sound was just coming in.
More often then not when that happens the motion of the film just stops as we watch the dialog scenes.
(Yes its fine when the action happens but those dialog scenes are deadly).
Its at its worst when Lugosi is alone on screen and he seems to be completely lost as if waiting for the director to tell him what to do.
One of the guys during the circle jerk scene has a voice like Macho Man Randy Savage, I noticed it when he kept saying "oooooh yeah!
Was when they were sitting in the office and they were about to be tied up with the tape and then the chic i cant remember her name gets the gaffer tap and she gets knocked to the ground by nitro.
And then when nitro is getting to the girls they are all tied up.
The case of this film fools you and so does what it says on the back of it as when i read it i thought it sounded really good.
I believe that he made the first commercial recordings from Porgy and Bess as Porgy, using the same dialect as in this film when he sings the Negro spiritual "Glory Road" in a perhaps over-dramatic rendition.
It takes a good deed by Nick against Danny as well as the knowledge of Nick's affair that causes Danny to spiral down, even with part of the money Betty gave to help Danny, which is used against her when Joe gets the news broken to him.
My favorite part was when Moses saw the burning bush, and when he parted the Red Sea.
I however did not like when Moses accidentally killed the guard on the structure.
Firstly there is a possibility of Joe & Betty getting out of their day to day existence when a developer is interested in their shops location for a sizeable amount of money.
The relationship of Joe's family changes when Danny returns home, with his wife and son.
We saw this indie film when it made its commercial debut.
This Friz Freling effort from a Michael Maltese story piles on all the gags that one always associate with the Warner Bros. cartoons, like the one when Bugs, as the lone pitcher of a baseball team, manages to strike out three members of the opposing team by throwing the ball reeeeaaaaallll slow as all three swing their bat real quickly with the announcer saying at that speed, "One, two, three, out!"
Or the one when Bugs distracts one of them by showing a picture of a sexy girl to keep him from catching the ball.
Treg Brown gives us several hilarious sound effects, such as what accompanies Bugs's wind-up pitch and what we hear when a Gorilla blows cigar smoke in Bugs's face.
This is the one you remember from when you were growing up and watching Saturday morning "Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner" cartoons.
I know I must have used some of these jokes when I was playing baseball as a kid.
In most Bugs Bunny cartoons, he is pitted against a foe, usually human, while formidable in their own way, are obviously not in his league when it comes to brains.
A typical star vehicle, the flick itself is a bore but we love Joan best when she is playing supreme bitch and in this pot boiler she plays it to the hilt.
Examples; when Jennifer arrives and everyone is in the drawing room and Eva makes her entrance.
And the characters kept going on about how nice Eva could be when you first meet her Â what?
And, eventually, Joan's evil, controlling and horrid nature seeps through and the audience comes to realize many things: she hates her own children (that must have been a BIG acting stretch), hates everyone around her, must be 100% in control of everyone and is like a wild animal when crossed.
The story begins when her sappy cousin (badly played by Lucy Marlow - you are almost happy when she gets slapped) arrives at Eva's mansion and boy, is she in for one wild ride!
He actually trembled when he spoke to me.
Few things are more amusing to me than the Hollywood myth that Joan Crawford, especially in middle age (she was 50 when this movie was made), was the most intensely sexy, desirable woman who ever lived.
Just when you think the stark, interior scenes with deep shadows have become too much, they switch to a bright, airy outdoor scene.
"Avery Phillips" (Barry Sullivan) was truly good in his alcoholic role - didn't you know the end of the movie would involve a car-accident when he picked up "Eva's" keys from his desk?
Queen Bee goes bye fast very fast and the moral compass is determined by Lucy Marlow when in fact it needed a sort of Anne Baxter or someone with a bit more gravitas.
The problem is the Inauguration was always held on March the 4th, that is until they changed the law in 1933, when the Inauguration was changed to be on January the 20th, so that there could be a quicker change of office.
I'm sure their collective scorn reached epic heights when the underdog Democrat, Mathew Santos, edged out stalwart Republican Senator Arnold Vinick in the general election.
Even when Bartlett took his final goodbye walk through the staff he made it personal but dignified.
The film is fortunate in that Brown, presented as a Broadway star, is genuinely funny when engaging in his slapstick humor.
We begin the story with an interview that Susana is having with Nora about what love is and what does a person feel when he or she sees their other half, for a school project that she is putting together.
The story starts to develop when Susana divorces her husband Carlos.
This movie stunned me when I first saw it, so I went and saw it again two days later.
As the film starts, everything comes to a head when he arrives home late one night.
No sooner is he in, when his cellular phone rings.
Damian Bichir, who we had admired in other Mexican films, does an excellent job as Carlos, the harried executive whose life is altered when Susana asks him to leave their home.
In one scene, the good guys all turn into "MacGyvers" when hiding in a room from the bad guys, the manage to create a smoke bomb out of a tin can as well as make a poisonous dart from a darts playing dart and blowing it through a pipe they happen to find.
Extraordinaries nail-biting action scenes, specially when Ryan and his partners are trapped by machine-gunners in a network of narrows streets and posteriorly parodied by Leslie Nielsen.
Love the acting between Harrison Ford and Willem Dafoe truly something to be admired, favorite scene when Ford goes to get the helicopter for Dafoe.
I was in tears and all emotional when I watched this movie.
The result is, when put together with Phillip Noyce's direction and the superb score of James Hormer, an intelligent thrill ride where the corruption of absolute power leads to a secret war with lives and the reputations of nations at stakes where enemies are both within and without with only one man capable of unraveling it all.
Second: The beginning part was one of the best parts of any Tom Clancy book i've read, save rainbow 6, it could account for the drama, romance section of the book  Third: The middle to ending could be like a strategic Platoon when Clark is doing operations in Vietnam.
But when Moises is so arrogant as his brother Ramses,but one night, when he was walking alone at night after searching for a woman(Tzipporah) Miriam and Aaron met with him and are surprised to see their little brother so close.
And when Ford finds out about the operation, he finds himself going down to Colombia a second time to help spirit Dafoe and the covert team out of harm's way.
Once again, Ford returns as Jack Ryan, who is appointed acting CIA Deputy Director of Intelligence, when CIA Deputy James Greer (James Earl Jones) is ill with cancer.
Who can Jack trust when he must?
The violence is not overdone in here and when the action does occur, the sound is terrific.
You know your town is under the influence of satanic forces when that happens!
The mysterious story starts to feel secondary and becomes convoluted, when the lousily questionable digital effects (poorly staged underwater scenes) and competently unpleasant gore fx and grotesque special make-up effects take over.
These profound latter moments are fine and all in well, but when it keeps you waiting around with drably uninteresting characters and a confusing parade of predictable (though there "one" moment that's not-so) ideas.
But the other reviews are totally right when they say about the actors sounding dubbed!
The animation is truly stunning, especially the scenes when Mozes splits up the Red Sea, and when he turns the Nile into blood (which was really kind of scary).
Oh, and the film is majorly distracting because there are an unbelievable amount of different accents in the film when really there is no need for that many.
He is much more inspired when dealing with them.
Someone or other has hatched a plan involving building a dam to flood the town and it's inhabitants; but the plan fails when a couple of no good kids end up freeing the cult leader before the town is engulfed in water.
The boy whose mother leaves in the care of Clara the baby sitter, cannot decide whether or not he is supposed to be scared to death or be slightly amused when unmentionable things happen to his mother.
The only moment in the special effects department that lives up to schlock director, Brian - The Re-animator - Yuzna's reputation is a gleefully monstrous scene when the local constable is discovered hysterically self-dismembering!
As a longtime Yuzna fan, I was absolutely delighted when I heard of this project.
The book mentions that there are 10 ways too see ghosts so the 5 people venture off to see these ghosts then one day after they played about 3-4 of them there friend disappears when playing one of the games.
I hate it when reviewers say things like "it's probably supposed to be funny but it just fails."
You know the times when you feel cold towards the characters because they don't act human, especially when they're too brave, and in real life, comedy is a massive element.
Also, it's still pretty scary in parts but in a more lighthearted way when comedy arises, and it still looks great.
But, when the gang play around with the spiritual world, the tone shifts somewhat, but the Pang Brothers always implement some tongue-in-cheek gag that removes the sheer horror of the situation.
An example being when Teddy is temporarily taken over by a spirit who has him break-dancing in a contest with a couple of clowns.
I thought the spirits were creepy enough when they expose themselves.
I've seen "The Eye" and "The Eye 2" and enjoyed them both, so when I heard about this one I got my hopes up that I could watch another scary horror movie.
This is generally the case when you cast martial artists as opposed to actors.
Starting in 1934, when the new Production Code was enacted, 'inappropriate' adult themes were generally forbidden in films.
However, when two thieves get caught up in the plot, the entire plan falls apart and where this all leads is anyone's guess.
The artwork was fabulous when it came out in 1999.
However, it sure was when it was released just seven years ago.
This movie tell us the history about a Man who was born in a small town in Mexico at 1880, He was left by his father when his mother died, 20 years later, he got to Santa Julia, another small town near to Mexico city, he went to find a better life, with few money and helped for her aunt, he join the Mexican army, but he discovered that they wasn't fighting against another army, they fought against people, people who disagree the government, an antidemocratic government.
Sometimes its disgusting, and at the end when actual body parts get in the mix of things (including, not too undeservedly, a penis and testicles, which actually are the dividing line that isn't crossed) it's downright crude, but it's downright raunchy and crazy and quintessentially Svankmajer.
Chris Owen is hilarious, especially when he finally gets his revenge on Rick at the dance!
You'll feel so happy and ready to conquer the world when it's over.
While the ending may have been a little cliched, it still is a enjoyable movie, and much better than your usual teen flick..I'll never understand why people enjoy "Clueless" when there are movies like Angus that offer far more accurate portrayals of high school life.
Watching Angus is like going back to a gentler time, when a finely acted moment counted as much as a special effect.
A different approach to the "Ringu" series this time making Sadako a sympathetic figure, a young woman tormented by others when, in fact, she is as much a victim as those whose lives are harmed by the vengeful ghoul.
"BÃ¢sudei" actually has two major climaxes, the theatrical production which spirals out of control when it should've been Sadako's finest hour on stage, and the discovery of where Ikuma had been hiding the alter ego, the lynch mob, behind an attack on our heroine, coming in contact, face-to-face with a fate worse than death.
This movie changed my life in so many ways, that it makes me upset when I read some of the negative reviews of it, declaring it just another "Teen Movie", This is so much more than that, I have read comments by viewers on websites, saying this movie "changed their life" and I cannot agree more, I really think Charlie Talbert is destined for stardom, he is just sensational, but unfortunately, he has never gotten the recgonition, or the parts he deserves, he has so much range as an actor, I definitely think Hollywood should take a closer look at him, and start sending scripts his way, and the rest of the cast is fantastic, This movie is truly a miracle.
A part that I didn't like was when Rick and his friends hurt Troy.
Are they as insecure as Angus when it comes to picking a genre'?
This movie should be shown in every single school district in this country when bullying is being discussed.
Thats when it hit me.
The plot point of the movie comes when Angus is chosen (by Rick as a joke) to go to the dance with his dream girl.
I have Tourrette's Syndrome, and was only beginning to show the major ticks associated with it when this movie came out.
As children, we might remember seeing things and make a simple yet direct remark about it, yet, as adults, we might see things, stop to think about it, taking into account all our past experiences and teachings, and make an "observation", when we soon realize that there are other people that have their own "observations".
This all changes, however, when Grampa dies.
As a seasoned film fan, one is always put on guard when a male lead tells his partner that she should experiment with sleeping with other people.
It also features a heart wrenching monologue by Angus (played by Charlie Talbert) when he confides in his grandfather (George C. Scott), who's about to be married.
And the end was freakiest when that Kanae girl was seen standing behind Kawajiri when he was recovering in hospital.
And when Yoichi's mother Reicha died when walking across the road and she got hit by a truck.
And when Kurashi went into the Institution to see Masami (a close friend of Tomoko's who was shocked by Tomoko's death), she walked past a t.v.
The first movie is an exercise in horror and scaredthe crap out of me, the sequel (although there are a number of scary scenes, when they see the manifestation of sadako and her mother for example) is more of a thriller come mystery movie.
The only really major disappointment in this movie is how sadako is manifested, in the first she was a faceless unstoppable force but in the sequel (except the scene in the well when she is quite literally faceless) she is portrade as a normallish girl........just a disapointment.
Kurahashi Masami, as far as I've read, wasn't there when Ooishi Tomoko died, so I'm not sure what will happen later in the novel, and how Masami became so central in the second half.
Later there is a certain satisfactory poetic justice when Kanae appears, giggling and smiling, behind the reporter in the hospital.
And when you turn off the lights, and imagine those nail less fingers stretching for your ankles, you know you won't be able to sleep easily for a while.
I had to press the return function of the remote control when I believed to hear that Paul GÃ©gauff, main actor and writer of the novel which is the base of Chabrols "Une partie de plaisir", says about his wife: "She sides with Korzybski who claims to refuse Aristote, but she hasn't read either one".
Possibly, in the eyes of GÃ©gauff's character, his wife breaks out of this restricted area when she goes into a sexual relationship with Habib.
Therefore, the final question arises: Does the reflexivity which arises when somebody plays himself still belong to Korzybski's principle or does it violate this principle, because self-reflexivity is excluded in a multi-ordinal world?
I hope when they do, Takahashi writes and Nakata directs.
Troubles arise when she discovers why Reiko went into hiding: her son Yoichi (Rikiya Otaka) is beginning to develop the same psychic powers that Sadako, the girl who supposedly created the video, used to display.
- The reporter who said he would then never watched the tape being freaked out when trying to erase the tape of the now dead girl.
The turning point of the film is when he advises Esther --"you should do it."
Esther is a battered woman and must endure that syndrome--she cannot fully grasp what Philip says to his buddies: "her weak point move me," and how many times is she willing to forego the depth of her own words: "since when do you care what I say."
You may also wish to watch Ringu 0: Basudei (2000) before Ringu, and for fun, the original "Ring 2", Rasen/Spiral (1998) before or after this "replacement sequel" (this one was produced when audiences were dissatisfied with the very differently toned Rasen/Spiral).
The film's ontology has it so that "mental energy", emotions and thoughts can be suppressed and subsequently "concentrated" to such an extent that when released externally, they can be dangerous to others.
Another standout moment is at the Yamamura family "hotel", when both Sadako and her mother eerily appear.
It may be far from an excellent film on its own, but it's certainly above average when viewed in conjunction with the series.
There is a little kid who gets a coin every time he drinks milk, which he saves in a piggybank; yet when it gets full does not have the heart to break it.
LOL But, honestly, this is a very good film--good acting from all involved, great music, especially at the end when the final scenes are showing, and a great settee--or whatever that couch thing is---sure don't look like the furniture we ever had.
LOL I really thought it was a bit much how, when Harriet goes to visit her mother in that nursing home, it was so spacious!!
But, when the film ended around 3am, I was wide awake and thrilled.
We all know that Joan Crawford had a very dark side to herself and she did her very best when she had this type of character to portray.
There is a big explosion when Harriet decides to upset her husband's career and goes to his boss to make matters even worse.
Until the publication of "Mommie Dearest," Crawford's performance perhaps elicited more praise than now, when it can be perceived as a rare glimpse into the off-screen Crawford household.
He described her as a very bright, knowledgeable woman when it came to every aspect of filming.
With just her eyes, Crawford showed Harriet's inner panic at being found out and her desperation when she realizes that Walter knows the truth.
The moment when he found out that Harriet had lied about not being able to have children was just heartbreaking.
In the scene where the woman gets thrown into the water, watch the water go back and forth from being in the swamp (when shown from a distance) and the local YWCA pool (when close up.)
And when that final dramatic sequence comes, you will be beaten and bowed but will applaud a relievedly fine comeuppance.
Clare tells Harriet that when she got no answer at the Craig number, she even had the operator check the number to be sure the phone wasn't out of order!
But, in the closing shot, when Crawford regally ascends her curved staircase alone among the splendor of her possessions, you wonder who's really won after all.
Wake me when it's over.
When nothing really special happens or when something really strange happens, I'm curious and want to see what the maker of the film is trying to say.
Some people when they hear about this probably relate it to the Godfather before even seeing it, and they are wrong for doing this.
All this slobbering is punctuated when the undercover cop falls into the swamp and she can't swim.
Later, when they find the diamonds the ladies do the most logical thing--have a long and pointless cat fight--complete with everything but jello!!
She is cursed, and is generally unaware when this seemingly multiple personality takes over her being, in this Shakespearean tragedy of a film that leaves one wishing it could have ended differently.
I still remember how much amazed I was when I first saw it.
A cocky, jerky, hyper-active/rambunctious test pilot (Quaid) who never outgrew his high school jock phase is miniaturized with the intention of being injected inside a rabbit, but when things go awry due to terrorist interference, he gets injected inside a man instead, specifically a hapless grocery store clerk (Short).
The best part about the movie was when "Jack Putter" was changing his facial features to become the cowboy and when he changed back!!
I saw this when it first came out and it had everything going for it.
I've seen this movie when it was quite young and I've just seen it again.
These days, blockbusters are too big, too empty and too superficially monumental, making them agreeable things to consume along with your popcorn at the cinema but proving to be hollow experiences when experienced on the small screen or even on a repeat viewing at the cinema.
The special effects are marvellous, especially when the film takes us inside Jack's body; these moments are often breathtaking, while's there's even a lovely moment when Pendleton temporarily finds himself inside Lydia and he sees their unborn child.
Things get awry when a rival company wrecks havoc in the lab, and one of his colleagues is forced to inject him to hypochondriac Jack Putter (Short) instead.
This film though for the most part worked, especially when it was being a comedy.
Quaid can really deliver when given the right material, something that Hollywood provides all too scarcely.
This all goes to show, however, that the film doesn't stand still for a minute, which can only be a good thing, especially when you have Quaid firing off the wisecracks.
Nothin's gonna fit ya" and "You better, you two-faced sonofab**ch"   An absolute blast from start to finish; this really is unfairly overlooked as being 'just another remake of 'Fantastic Voyage'", when in reality it compares well with acknowledged classics of the comedy adventure genre such as "Back to the Future".
The plot: Pilot Lt. Tuck Pendleton is a member of a top-secret miniaturization experiment, that sadly goes wrong when a rival team of scientists, try to stole their plans and ideas to make miniaturization a success for them.
The story begins when Lt Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid), an excellent pilot but an irresponsible hard drinker volunteers for a highly unusual experiment.
Some of his antics can be funny too, such as the crazy dance he does in Tuck's apartment, and yelling "I'm possessed" when he first hears Tuck's voice inside his head.
One of the funniest scenes is when Tuck alters Jack's face to look like The Cowboy (Robert Picardo), someone who has come to buy the microchip off Scrimshaw (Kevin McCarthy), the man responsible for stealing the chip in the first place.
One of the best scenes is when Tuck is nearly pulled into Jack's heart, and is very nail biting.
Another good scene is when Tuck ends up in Lydia's body through a kiss with Jack, and sees his unborn child in her womb.
Tuck Pendleton (Dennis Quaid) is a hotshot Navy pilot on an unusual and top secret mission; he is to be shrunk down and injected into the body of a rabbit, but when things go wrong he ends up inside Jack Putter (Martin Short) instead.
I first saw "Innerspace" when I was 11.
What do you get when you cross a hemophiliac-native American with a poor story, bad acting and complete rubbish?
My favorite part is when he said something along the lines of:  "When I review films and I am on the panel, oftentimes it's all PhDs and me.
So when the gang is in town, to check out the bank, they run in to Burt, killing him.
It's all about the "bling" for these girls, so when they become stranded ashore they "boat-jack" two young lovers who are out admiring the fettering malaria-infested bayou locales.
Here's to the next effort in this sub-genre, may it be something deep and resonant... Ernest Dickerson, where are you when we need you!
They're trying to get us to believe that any of this could have happened in the American west of the past, when they can't even get us to believe that any of this could have happened at any time on the planet Earth.
I am wondering how the heck anyone can know the exact place something is buried out there when they haven't been there for three years.
So for all the Sex and the City fans, the ones who own every season, who order cosmos when they're out with their girlfriends and wear high heels when they're going to a BBQ, it's time to try something new.
I'm not sure, but I bet when he auditioned for the part he said he could do it with his hands tied behind his back.
(The actresses are great in their own roles - it's only when they're together that you may question if they're really best friends.)
The dialogue of the show feels forced at times, especially when the male writers want to underline how close and "female" these four women are.
Mark and Jenifer Baines are attempting to reopen the mine, but find themselves in trouble when the workers won't go down for fear of an ancient curse.
At the time when Jennifer arrives, Mark is facing the refusal of his workers to go deeper as they believe the mine is haunted.
ZacarÃ­as has done better films when he has a good script to work with, but in "Demonoid", the lack of coherency of the plot simply make the film boring and tedious.
It's kind of sad that ZacarÃ­as had the chance to make this film when the Mexican film industry was at its lowest point, as the very ambitious idea (that without a doubt looked good on paper) simply couldn't work well on film.
It turns into a real treat when they cut the legs off of their pants.
The effects are cheap looking, but effectively gruesome for the most part and funny when they aren't.
Correspondent/spy Valerie Blore (as played by Ann Savage) correctly appraised the situation when she says: "Whoever wins Africa wins the war."
The badinage between Blore and William was perfect, hardly any serious exchange between them throughout, except when Blore was either tied up or being untied.
The series begins on a deceptively cheerful note when young Shuzo Matsutani--who refers to himself as Shu, so that's what I'll call him from now on--is making his way home from a kendo practice match when he sees -- wouldn't you know -- a mysterious, quiet girl sitting alone on a water tower.
Of course, Lala Ru does not have it; Shu took it from her in a vain rescue attempt only to lose it again when he is taken prisoner himself.
Also, like in all bad action movies, either the number one or number two baddie will be totally cruel and evil when he's got the good guy tied up but will become a shivering coward once the roles are reversed.
Poor acting, Hogan can only play with his eyes, even when he close them, and Shannon Tweed is never naked...
Harry Berlin (Jack Lemmon) is about to commit suicide by jumping off the Manhattan Bridge when old acquaintance Milt Manville (Peter Falk) serendipitously scoots by, oblivious to Harry's intentions, and blithely asks him to come to dinner.
Try as she might, Woody Allen's second wife, Louise Lasser, understudy in the original Broadway production, could never quite match Elaine May when it came to sheer J.
There are some inspired moments when the lovebirds place confidence in each other.
My favorite moment comes when Ellen examines her diagrams and jumps to the conclusion: " You love exclusively Milt - you are gay!".
Lemmon's facial expression when he considers this alternative for a very long second is priceless, but sadly those moments are rare.
I adore the moment when the entire cast sings `Happy birthday' to him.
A new group called Boyzone, young men all dressed in white - makes one wonder aloud, when will they take America by storm?
But the best scene is at the end when Fred "Hammer" sticks one of his trademark cigars into a pooch's mouth.
Especially when Richard "SHAFT" Roundtree is in the mix!
I am not joking when I say this.
Now, maybe I am biased when I rate this movie a 10, but I was on the edge of my seat in this non-stop thriller.
The movie doesn't explain why Freddy is afraid of heights or why he lied to Carmen when they first met.
Things become truly adventurous when the band of pirates set out for a return to Treasure Island and meet up with some most unexpected surprises and obstacles along the way.
Last night I watched this HBO special since his road material is usually different when he does the big show.
This was a very ingeniously performed routine that took a shot at all the ills of pop-culture, the morbid curiosity of your average person, and ultimately the extreme human behavior(exclusive to us so-called "civilized" beings) that shows how primitive we really are...  And for those of you that don't think there's punchlines how 'bout when he talks 'bout "scarfing" and throws in the pun, "think of how many kids are trying to pull this one off" Also he touches on several current topics like obesity, stupidity, and consumerism that are just becoming too much of an issue to ignore, I mean the whole "pretty soon all you'll need to get into college is a pencil" is so true, I mean I know that i'm not as "enlightened" or "educated" as I should be and I know that if I had the same study habits/dedication towards school just 20yrs ago there's no way I'd be able to get a college degree but now i'm just a couple months away from graduating college, just going to show that they're definitely lowering the standards, I mean I'm no dummy either, but still, getting into and graduating college is becoming less of a big deal 'cause the best way to help "educate" the ppl is to lower the standards....
The majority of the material seems to be centered around subjects like death, dying, suicide, murder, and other cheery topics, yet, as always when watching George, I found myself laughing my ass off and agreeing with everything he says because after all these years of pushing the comedic envelope, one constant that has never changed with George is that everything he says is absolutely correct.
The most touching scene in the film takes place when the split-personality plagued main character (for the life of me I can't think of his name at the moment) shares a meal with his 'Deliverance' foster family in their trailer that could either be a chicken coop or a bomb shelter.
For a start he talks about a lot of Americans right off the bat when he discusses obesity, as a third of Americans are classified as medically obese and about half of those as morbidly obese, according to the latest American Medical Association studies.
Typical of the vast majority of naysayers, they are really talking about themselves when they describe George as "bitter".
It's why it is always a risk to tell the truth because most people want to kill the messenger that brings them bad news, especially when that "news" (intentional ignorance actually) is about themselves.
In a way I should've expected this- I remember reading a couple of years back when he was planning the special that it would be more based around language (if nothing else he is the single greatest linguist in the history of post-modern stand-up), and on that level the special isn't a disappointment.
Two annoying long-haired teens who look like they belong on-stage with Warrant, and their two girlfriends (in stone washed jeans) are attacked when they travel to a "secluded" house out in the sticks.
It takes much courage to struggle in a world that has so-long been divided especially when it comes to finding black roles in the acting industry; as well as having her voice heard without being accused of being radical.
At only 17 years of age, and from humble origins in Vicksburg, Mississippi, she composed one of the most moving poetic tributes you're ever likely to hear--to the legendary Paul Robeson--and she had the opportunity to read it to him when they met years later.

The shipmates grumble when they realize they will dock to take aboard wartime ammunitions.
The festivities began when a group of Spanish women board the ship and bring fruit and smuggle rum for the sailors.
It changed once when the Spanish girls came on board and again when they finally reached land and were able to get drunk.
You can easily tell how bored sailors become because of how they acted when the Spanish girls cam on board.
One quote that caught my attention was when a sailor said, "When a man goes out to sea, he should give up thinking about shoreÂLand don't want him no more."
Two sailors, Smitty and Yank died while on board of Glencairn and Drisk died at the end when he was aboard Amindra and it got torpedoed.
It was strange how he died because he was on a row boat hanging on the side of the ship, and when he got shot, the tarp just covered him and nobody really knew when he died.
Ole, the Swedish sailor also expresses his loneliness when they arrive on land and he tells the woman at the bar about how he hasn't seen his family in almost 10 years.
Much of the story seems to be too contrived, I mean how lonesome did those seafarers did get at sea that they behaved so erratically when they were ashore?
My favorite images are near the end when the sailors are drunk and they're looking for Ole, the lighting and camera angles produce an uncanny atmosphere that combines very well with the puzzling state the drunken men must be in.
The picture belongs period when John Ford(1895-1973) made a rich variety of stories and his reputation rightly rests on his work in the 1940s, as Â¨Grapes of wrath,How green was my valley,Fugitive,They were expendable, My darling ClementineÂ¨and the Cavalry trilogy: Â¨Fort Apache, She wore a yellow ribbon, Rio GrandeÂ¨.
Although The Searchers probably contains his best role, The Long Voyage Home would certainly be worth a major mention when talking about his career.
Especially in the part when the crew becomes convinced that Ian Hunter is some kind of spy.
Biao plays a lawyer who takes the law into his own hands when the bad guys shoot a good friend of his outside the courthouse (hence the UK title 'Above The Law').
Meanwhile, her father is worried about her but has to attend to his nuptial duties first, and when his maid complains he includes her in the wedding night proceedings.
The best line of the movie is when Joey Silvera hands a joint to two Girl Scouts and says"Here little girl, smoke some dope!"
However, his priorities change when the smaller vessel Galileo, containing Spock and six other men (hence the episode's title), lands on a hostile planet and requires immediate assistance.
Pretty nice action, especially the scene at the Honey Festival (how appropriate to name a festival that when everybody was about to be overwhelmed with killer bees).
But, since this was a first season episode, it may have been filmed before Leonard Nimoy had fully come to understand his character and the proper way to play him, (for example, he was still speaking with that put-on British accent like when he pronounces the word command as "commond").
The scene that REALLY irritates me is when Boma pops his head in and says that they're ready for services for Latimer (a crewman who was speared in the back).
Boma takes the same stance when they need to leave Gaetano's body behind.
Anyway, this series was a great and I despise when Hollywood takes a good series and recasts with them anybody less than the original.
Sometimes I review lists of the greatest 10, 20, or 25 American TV shows in history, and when I don't find (Magnum P.I) in one, I say maybe the makers of this list are : so poor to not watch it, or so pathetically dumb and fool to forget it, or watched it and refused to include it (folks I don't want to know at all!)
The first when I was a kid at the 1980s and (Magnum) was the assured ride of fun.
The second one was after I've studied cinema and writing scripts, that when I discovered how this show had it all, so every episode of the reruns was such a lesson about how to make a classic work and a great amount of entertainment too.
So, when I made a list of my own for the best 10 TV shows ever, I found no competitor on the first rank but the greatest "Magnum, P.I.".
when by chance I saw an episode I now recognize as a third season one; I was puzzled then since I realized I was missing something from the life's stories of these intriguing characters: it was like intruding in someone else's life, more than a pi standard TV-movie... That's it: I believe you're hooked by the believable interaction of the main characters, their likes and dislikes; some episodes are quite 'poor' and unbelievable, but never awful; other episodes are more complex and well shot; but almost always you'll have some fun with them; and finally Magnum's off screen voice is capturing your attention, and make you another close friend worth of his confidence... After so many years, one day I just missed that feeling and I discovered the two first seasons were published on DVD, so now, after watching them, I feel reassured of not being a 'stranger' in Magnum's world anymore....
I enjoy watching the show as much now as I did when it originally aired.
You don't think of Ba Ba Black Sheep & Battlestar Gallactica when you think of Bellsario/ Larsen, but of Quantum Leap, Knight Rider, Qunicy & Jag among others.
Catch it when you can, as I recently caught the pilot 2 hour premiere on a rerun.
Although I can't correlate the two events, when Magnum went off air in 1988 I stopped watching network television and haven't watched it since.
I was never a big TV fan so when Magnum went off air it was just the reason I needed to turn off the tube.
I admit it: I didn't watch this show when it first aired.
Tom Selleck and cast are utterly delightful, and I think this show is quite underrated, because when you take away the car chases there are still first and foremost good story lines and good writing.
Higgins is the one who..." I really wish I'd gotten into this series when it was on, and that I appreciated it for what it was, but alas, I did not.
This guy Selleck was too good looking in an old Hollywood way (Clark Gable), his voice seemed an octave too high for a man of his size and looks, so damn many women were positively orgasmic when they talked about him and women are notorious for going after some really shallow males, and the few times I caught a scene or two flipping through channels, he seemed smug, or at least that's how I perceived him.
Like Duke in Rio Bravo, Magnum had loyal friends to back his play as he tries to set things right when no one else will help him, and like Bogie in Casablanca, Magnum has an ill-fated love affair he is going to have to give up to a higher duty.
Magnum and friends have to relive their haunted unresolved past in Vietnam, prevent an assassination, not only in Hawaii but also in other areas of the world, and seek justice and retribution when the powers that be can not put Ivan in jail.
on DVD, and whenever I want something to watch and can not decide on something from my library, I pull out the private investigator in Hawaii and go back to a time not all that long ago, when life seemed somewhat more clear and safe, and certainly younger, and a tall man in a Tiger baseball hat and Hawaiian shirt, with a red Ferrari and a Colt .45 auto, went out to do the decent thing and right the wrongs of the day.
I visited Hawaii when I was a senior in high school!!
It's an incredible story portraying Native American legends, and also shows the struggle that modern day Native American teens go through when trying to find their identity.
I do agree with the previous comment that when it aired it was annoying that it was constantly interrupted with commercials.
There are no words to describe the emotion that fills within me when thinking about the lives of American Indians.
Dreamkeeper shocked me with wonder when I saw it on regular ABC TV a few years ago... many moons ago... how time has flown.
when do we finally realize , the world is dying??!!
I was amazed when I saw the depictions of stories I had actually heard as a child, growing up in Tahlequah Oklahoma, the Cherokee Nation Capitol.
In the beginning he don't want that but when he realizes that he also has 1 day to pay the money back to the gang than it maybe could be a good alternative to escape.
When the true murderer is revealed, it is disappointing to say the least when their motive is given.
We've all heard that phrase before, and if ever that tried and true proverb needs uttering it's when discussing Gareth Rhys Jones' 1999 directorial debut, Bodywork.
In fact it is the Jaguar car which proves to be his down fall when a body is discovered in the boot and he is framed for murder.
I was okay with this film until about the 20 minute mark when the autistic boy starts playing with his own feces.
Especially when it's done this well.
That my other cousin well her older sister had to do the same things that Thomas had to do when she was young and when i look back upon it now she never complained she was alway the quite one and she was always there for her sister.
It's even worse when the older brother is severely autistic and unable to care for himself in any way.
Films dealing with family lives like this only work when they show all the sides to a story and this one does it well.
Especially as when he finally has her over to dinner, Charlie gets his testosterone-filled kit out at the table and gives it a good rub.
He wants to keep his brother a secret from his new schoolmates but when one student (Gemma Ward) learns of his sibling, she's not put off.
She's heavily pregnant and when complications arise from her pregnancy, we can't help but wonder if the third child will be like Thomas or Charlie.
There are plenty of amusing moments; when a fight breaks out in a bus queue outside a high school several male teachers try ineffectually to stop it and it is the tiny but determined female lifesaving coach who, furiously blowing her whistle, restores order.
They run in slow motion; they place themselves physically close to one another even when they are in conflict; and Jason Schwartzman's love scene with "Rita" is visually PG (no nudity, no obvious humping) - but when he licks his fingers and puts them "somewhere" down below the camera frame, he participates in one of the more sensual sex scenes I have seen.
I don't know when I've laughed so hard at pathetic "effects".
Of course, when I did finally see it, I was excited to see it was another Wes Anderson creation.
I can't see any other actors playing in the roles of these three quirky brothers and I can't believe how amazing I felt when the movie was over.
But I think the world learns a great deal from Americans when we travel and assume that foreigners are not fluent in English.
I watched 'Killer Bees" when I was on a school camping.
He's enjoying solitary luxury in a nice Paris hotel, when his girlfriend (Portman), also estranged, turns up.
If i had a De Lorean, i'd hit 88mph, go back to the point when i first decided that i wanted to watch this atrocity and say to myself "don't do it, trust me, i'm you from the future and i've seen it".
In particular, it's not so great to watch bland, unlikeable Americans going to India to 'find' themselves when the film is so uninterested itself in India.
He yearns to be mysterious and exotic, or a romantic expatriate artiste, but when he attempts to act as such, it just comes off awkward and forced.
He knows when to throw inside jokes to his most loyal of fans, while keeping his stories fresh and personal, without acknowledging the critics who blame Anderson for repeating himself.
when they performed in San Francisco in the early 1970s.
The only tense part of the play was when we heard the sirens of emergency vehicles in the street outside of the theater!
At least, that's what Sheriff Lyndon Harris finds when he spots a truck full of the insects crash.
You get to see this guy's tush--so, if you do NOT want the kiddies seeing this, either speed the DVD up when Mrs. Molyneux enters the greenhouse or try another film.
And when I leave, they're dead."
Spoofs are generally not popular with the masses (except when Crosby/Hope or Abbott/Costello or Woody Allen are doing the spoofing) so it's no surprise to discover there exist few box-office viable spoofs of film noir.
Their cook has just left the family, when Irwin's snoopy and hypocrite cousin Archibald Soper (Louis Jouvet) that is in campaign against the police stories of Felix Chapel invites himself to have dinner in Irwin's house.
There are glimpses of Sadako's strange powers, which she can't seem to control when she's threatened.
Sadako then ends up with the leading role in the play but when the meddling reporter slips a tape in that isn't meant to be part of the play, it changes everything and Sadako's telekinetic powers are unleashed on the unsuspecting audience and cast, but stopped just short of harm to anyone....except, herself.
All three have abilities and a special unit(which is cloaked, but can be detected, when using abilities or if the enemy has a unit that uncloaks their enemies) that fit their profile... GLA has a sniper, who(in addition to sniping infantry) can kill the driver of any enemy vehicle, the Chinese have an unarmed agent who, using her lap-top, can steal from the enemies and disable their vehicles one at a time, and the US have a battle-hardened colonel, equipped with a knife, explosives and a machine-gun(essentially a Commando/Tanya, but oh well, those *are* pretty rockin').
The air-borne combat is made more open, particularly when playing as the US, which has access to three different types of planes, a transport helicopter and an attack chopper(and that's in addition to the special abilities).
I supposed this is good when you literally have nothing ells to do.
There is also a great bit when a girl explains sex to someone in a very frank way.
Only when something drastic happens beyond their control are they forced to re-evaluate where they are and change their lives.
So when I saw Rabid Grannies, the cover and title alone was enough for me.
I was obsessed with this movie when it came out.
This movie was made when I was two.
This is for when you're feeling like you need some company, but you don't feel like venturing past your doorstep.
I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I put this movie in my DVD player.
From the very beginning I was drawn in, as much as one can be when someone is fornicating with Sarah Michelle Gellar while playing music from multiple boom boxes and smoking a blunt.
The only comedy side to this film is that when the killing starts the people act as though its nothing out of the ordinary.
The scene when Alan got real high on 3 hits of LSD was very funny.
Especially when so much of the movie's backdrop is the Harvard campus and Cambridge.
Initially when I accidentally started watching it, I thought it was the worst thing I had ever seen, what with the poor editing job.
Allen's life changes when his parents home in Kansas, is hit by a tornado and, in what has to be the very definition of the phrase "Deus ex machina", they do not have tornado insurance.
And just when you think the movie will have a pat ending, a question mark enters the scene in a way you wouldn't expect.
You have to check this out when you get the chance... 7/10
It must be difficult to really set herself in and give a good performance when she has such little time.
I really like morality tales but I feel a bit ripped when the ending doesn't end with a crash and burn (much like Risky Business or The Graduate).
I love it when movies inject philosophy into the plot of a film because the film is then acknowledging that something is supposed to be learned by watching it and therefore it isn't stupid.
However, when the old ladies open it, they become possessed by evil spirits and mutate into cannibalistic, demonic zombies, hungry for human flesh.
But, when the gore starts to fly, and the death scenes become increasingly mean-spirited and frighteningly intense (the film's one legitimate flaw), you start to see the humanity in them.
And finally, when the aunts become possessed, they are suddenly filled with a sense of perception they were missing before.
Never moreso than when a certain cousin on the plump side has his leg carved open and slowly stabbed, licked, chewed, and devoured by the putrid, alien-like demons.
But heck, I really don't know what the director was trying to do..and I'm sure he was completely high when he hired those actors, specially Rutge Hauer, for the bloodsucking, Count Dracula.
An excellent example of when film-makers get tired of a project half way through, and rather than create a quality project, simply go through the motions.
And secondly, this is my opinion of the movie, as opinions are ALWAYS different please keep an open mind when reading this review, thank you.
It's a waste of 90 minutes when they're so much other things to do with one's time.
You can notice that part when "Dracula" puts his "sword" on Uffizi's neck and say "You can still save her you know, have all you've been denied, but are you worthy?"
Throughout the whole movie, everybody is driveling about how almighty Dracula is, but when he finally makes an appearance (in the shape of B-movie veteran Rutger Hauer), he turns out to be a lame philosopher who prefers to plea instead of to kill.
It wouldn't make sense to give this a theatrical release when Dracula II: ASCENSION went direct-to-video although it certainly did deserve a theatrical release.
She could bite me anytime when she was in vampire form or not lol.
I loved it in the end when he kills Elizabeth.
But we don't feel sorry for him anymore, not when he has human minions kidnapping Romanian villagers for his private suckfest, or the fact that he keeps a pathetic "harem" of vampire women constantly feeding on local girls, of which he has thrust poor Elizabeth into.
Their flirtation is rather cute, almost like puppy love, especially when Uffizi cracks his rock-hard face to smile at her.
Literally it's just footage of his speeches to different universities and local press conferences when he toured several cities in swing states.
You just can't take something so personal to someone's family history when its completely meaningless to yours.
And when I mean hate I mean that he has to have at least one bodyguard, or more depending on the city, in the hopefully unlikely event that he could be attacked or shot or whatever.
The documentary takes place not just during the final phase of the election, but when American emotions over the Iraq war were in flux.
Whatever your political persuasion a good society needs its Michael Moore's, he's a voice of conscience, a voice that says what needs to be said when no-one else will do.
I saw this film once when it can out in 1971 and it has been in the back of my mind all these years.
I searched for that film in every TV schedule for more than ten years...it must have been practically every day, because when I did find it(and made my copy!
Being a proud, prickly adolescent, he idiotically uses this joyous landmark family occasion to start a nasty argument in which he rants against his baffled parents, warning them of what is going to happen to people like them when people like him righteously rise up to end the wrongs they have been enduring.
I've loved this movie ever since I saw it when it came out.
I cried when the Jerk let his friends "view" the elephant man at night when they picked him up and twirled him around and threw liquor down his throat.
Some of the scenes in the film are incredibly hard to watch, when the worst of humankind is shown being as cruel as possible.
It will lift you to the heights of what we can do with our lives when we get outside of ourselves and invest ourselves in other people.
I mostly enjoy 'true' films, when the plot actually happened.
), the film culminates with the terrible act of attempted murder that we partially witnessed in the original "Ringu," and fans of the series will perhaps understand me when I say that, um, all's well that ends well!
Some parts made me very angry - when Merrick was mistreated & exploited like an animal that he certainly wasn't.
I can still remember the palpable air of silence and awe over the audience when leaving the theater both times I saw it on the big screen.
Maybe you'll find it to be funny, when you watch a movie that's so bad that it's funny?
It also has a great supporting cast which is mainly the "bad guys" and when they make Burt mad he makes them wish they didn't.
There aretimes, such as this one, when I think that those who edit films should be test-run before a small audience, if only to see how far deletions can be unsatisfactory.
The party really gets started when the aunts open a present coming from a banished nephew that turns them into mad carnivorous monsters!
I knew then that I would seldom see such a bold stroke; Lancaster shows what he is really made of when the glossy facade is dropped.
The sheer moral vacuum of Tanner is a depiction of the worst that can happen when location and money allow someone to construct a "reliaty" founded on self-image - kill a man so that no-one will have cause to wonder if I killed my lover's husband to grab her - I don't need to kill someone to take his woman - and a life is a small price to pay to make that clear.
RL Davis is sent on his way when he is told by Frank that he couldn't shoot straight.
RL, in his only moment of kindness in the film, releases Valdez from his ropes after an incident when Bob tried to break the wood roped to his arms.
Still Valdez has a problem when RL tells Frank of Bob's friend's helping him and this act of betrayal proves once and for all that RL is a greedy lowlife simply desiring to be one of the guys.
It's one of those vendetta entertainments that often frequent the multiplexes in the 60's and 70's when the rules, thanks in large part to Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch", were starting to be broken.
After reading it, I said to a close friend, 'Hey, this is a great story Â and it'd be another great movie..." So, when he told me it already was, I just had to get it and have a look.
So, when you get wind of another one from this master storyteller, you sit up and take notice.
Leonard's heroes tend to fall into two camps: the tough guy who's got heart when needed, or the guy with heart who gets tough when pushed.
Then why does each ignore the warnings when they arise before hand?
Townsmen and friends alike, know little of him or his background, until an uneventful day when a rich and powerful land Baron, incites all to chase and corner an ex-army soldier because he "looks familiar."
...was Bob Valdez's reply when he was asked when he used to hunt and shoot down Indians to eradicate them from rangeland.
Of course, when he tries to do the honorable thing, he is treacherously dealt with, which leads to one of the most entertaining and compelling westerns ever filmed.
Burt LancasterÂat that time 57 years oldÂin fact dominates the film by a mystic presence, rather than actually being on screen for any length of timeÂ  The bulk of the film constitutes a battle of wits and guns between Valdez and an extremely stubborn leader of a band of trigger-happy gun-slingersÂ   So when Frank Tanner (John Cypher) provokes a shoot-out which results in the death of an innocent man, Valdez asks $100 compensation from Tanner to provide financial support for his pregnant widowÂ Tanner not only refuses, but humiliates Valdez and orders his hired gunmen to beat him hardly, to tie him to a cross, and to drive him out of his placeÂ   Again Spain locations represented the American frontier for this revenge tale about an aging former cavalry man who dusts off his old uniform, straps on his old guns, takes plenty of ammunition, and erupt a one-man army against a greedy, rotten, evil rancher and his henchmen to enforce justice at any costÂ  As the pursuers forge deeper into the wilderness, the situation shifts around with hunters becoming the huntedÂ  Susan Clark (Gay) sides with Valdez without falling in love with him, while Barton Heyman (playing the chief henchman "El Segundo") provides his character with warmth and quality at a pivotal timeÂ
But when he starts talking to a guy who he dosen't know he becomes interested in him and minutes later discovers that he is talking to his dad, who has been dead for thirty years.
When I watched it in the cinema, near the end of the movie when John Sullivan Sr reappeared, ALL THE AUDIENCES IN THE CINEMA cheered and applauded.
This movie BLEW ME AWAY with how it handled what had seemed like a goofy premise when the flick had come out.
I had never seen any trailers or read any reviews of 'Frequency' so when it was there to be watched on a Saturday evening on a satellite movie channel, the synopsis sounded interesting so I settled down to watch 'another movie'.
I was so captivated by the secondary plot, an old unsolved murder case that quickly becomes personal when father and son play G-d, that I didn't have a chance to care about the unidimensionality of most of the characters, the flavorless dialogue or the predictability of the action.
but when it gets shown on HBO, it is considered as a rare find.
Spacey, soon-to-be-divorced cop John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) is toying with his deceased fathers old HAM radio one night, when, through some odd twist of fate so common in sci-fi films, he contacts his father Frank (Dennis Quaid) 30 years in the past.
Frank, who is a firefighter, died in a flaming building when John was 6.
However, when the old women open a surprise birthday present (sent by the black sheep of the familyÂa practitioner of the black arts), they become possessed, transform into vicious, drooling, bloodthirsty monsters, and proceed to tear their party guests limb from limb.
Definitely a movie to keep you on the edge of your seat, and when the timelines converge at the end, it was a total surprise and brought the end in just like a story should!
Caviezel's character cried when he first talked to his father that had been dead for thirty years.
It teaches love and does so without relying on the tension of plot because as I discovered, it still works after ten viewings when the end is not in doubt and "what happens next" isn't why your eyes are fixed on the screen.
The concept of time traveling communication may seem far-fetched to some, and "Frequency" is a little hard to grasp at times, especially when the film never directly explains why the father and son are able to talk with each other through time.
...but when was the last time you saw Richard Farnsworth and metal queen Lita Ford in the same movie?
His hobby is ham radio when not rescuing people from near death in the line of duty.
His son John is just a child and dreams of being a baseball player when he grows up.
you learn a lot about girls who live in the rich live and see how they react when they have to work at a factory to make up for something they did wrong.
when they arrive at the dairy, they cause many more problems.
when their uncle steals all the companies money,Taylor takes 20,000 dollars out of Courtney's 25,000 dollars for her cotillion.
so when they find out that the expiration date was set wrong, they pull all their friends together and try to save the dairy.
Yet, when their father goes on an extended vacation, the dairy suddenly takes a downward turn, thanks to some skullduggery by one of the high ranking employees.
The Michalka sisters get a lot more than they bargain for when the paychecks at the plant bounce because, Rhoades emptied the accounts of the business and ran off.
Amanda Michalka had her moments, when she wasn't that terrible.
Charles Grodin has always been on the border line when it comes to being funny and serious.
Maybe because at one time or another we have sunk as low when in pursuit of someone we lust after.
One can ask how can a picture be good when its hero, played by Charles Grodin, marries Jeannie Berlin in synagogue at the beginning of the film, and by the latter's end, he is marrying Cybil Shepherd in church.
This show was one of those rare times when everything (directing, writing and acting) came together to create something greater than the sum of its parts - it's a real treasure.
I saw this when it first came out in 1972 and saw it again recently on cable.
And yet at that moment in the restaurant when Lenny breaks the news to Lila over that half-slice of pecan pie, our hearts just break for her, and Lenny's feeble, yet honest (although ultimately self-serving) attempt to comfort her also touches us, as does Kelly's joie de vivre and passion for Lenny, and her parent's obvious conflicting feelings of protection, love and knowing they have to let go.
So, Lenny decides to dump his newlywed wife to pursue Kelly, whose attraction to him is a mystery; it appears she's only toying with the young bridegroom until the incredible (and disappointing) end when he wins her away from her disapproving father (Eddie Albert, his performance being the film's only highlight).
One of these, when two characters are enigmatically killed off-screen, is a rare example of an "attack scene" where I agree that what you're not shown can be more effective than what you are shown.
Worth a watch if you are a Ketzal Sterling fan, from the days when he was doing High Octane - another cheesy product but TOTALLY appropriate for that market.
this film is essentially a lark about by some guys from new Zealand and really that is all it is, I don't think when they made the movie the filmmakers were thinking that this was going to be a world wide blockbuster or an intellectual indie thought provoker they simply made a movie that they thought would be fun and hoped that others would as well.
I am looking forward to what they do with the sequel when they have a few more dollars to play with.
It was released in the early 90's, back when it wasn't a good move release a film like this one.
Especially when I found out Danneel, Jensen, and Elizabeth were there, also and I adore all 3 of them.
This is something that doesn't happen for me much anymore when I go to the movie.
Those feelings of insecurities that everyone goes through sometime in their life, and feeling that their not good enough, but having loved ones be there for you when you need them the most and telling you that you are.
Everyone around me genuinely laughed and clapped and cheered something I also don't see much in movies and a lot of that was when the Priestly character was on screen.
I had seen her briefly on One Tree Hill and liked her on there, and also found out she was Alice whom I really loved as a little girl when I watched the Disney Channel but didn't really know exactly what to expect until the movie.
In reality, that's exactly what this movie turned out to be - an unexpected surprise and a truly uplifting story - when realistically, the average viewer would have just been satisfied to ogle Jensen Ackles sporting a mohawk.
Elizabeth Harnois gives an exceptional breakout performance as Piper, the artistic neophyte who introduces our 'Heroes' when she stumbles across the eccentric hippy-run diner and applies for a job on the spot, told "normal people need not apply".
maybe they think they're quirky indie cinema, maybe they think they're punk when they're really just jocks,  Did I mention the direction was really really bad.
Yes it had it moments when the wheels where spinning in my head and I was able to call it before it happened but it also keep my guessing and took a few turns I never would have guessed.
The way they set it up for us to find out was funny, but when it came to open up about it, it was heart warming.
I cringed when reality seeped in, and I cried when I found their truth.
I am definitely buying this one when it's released on DVD.
I'll be buying this when it's available.
I have not stopped talking about it, and they are all now convinced to go see it, when it hits the big screens.
And trust me, I'll be buying it when it comes out on DVD.
It is destined to supplant Pretty Woman as my new favorite movie to watch when I need a lift.
Charlie and Rachael are on their way to Las Vegas to elope, but when they take a back-road.
I must say I was surprised when I saw this movie.
The movie was a good way to view how justice can be served when its needed.
I mean I never expected the one scene when the one girl went up to the office to have happened.
We seem to hold the belief that when someone is incarcerated, guilty or not, whatever treatment they receive on "the inside" is something they deserve.
And they collide in the scenic Irish arena of the early 1940's when the world was about to change forever.In the end, we are reminded that values are either good or bad and somehow bring conflict and eventual resolution.
It grabs you from the start and then holds on when our stars jump over the real world divide.
Elizabeth Shue, who is constantly overlooked when juicy female roles are doles out, once again delivers a remarkable performance as does Deb Unger in a lesser and difficult role.
Having been in the industry for nearly 2 decades when this movie was released, it's exciting to see the (still gorgeous) actress making yet another Leaving Las Vegas-style breakthrough.
He's just about to enjoy his first sip of a Paradise Cocktail when he spills most of it -- after being bumped by Kay Francis, who smiles brightly despite having an incurable disease.
Neither knows that the other is walking death row, either figuratively or literally, but love intercedes on their behalf: just as a star is brightest before its extinction, so too is love at its most passionate when the lovers' time is limited.
This is irresistible hoke, and the director Tay Garnet invests it with wonderfully eccentric touches (like the burly lesbian among the trio of portly harmonizers in a Hong Kong bar) and innovative dream-like imagery (i.e., the startling camera zoom when Powell spots Francis at the ship's railing).
Now if the original film were somehow seriously flawed and the remake corrected that, I could understand, but too often, like the saying goes, "when you've seen one, you've seen them all".
His later movies, especially in the Busby Berkeley musicals of the 1930s, emphasized more silliness, but "One Way Passage" shows more of what McHugh can really do when given the opportunity.
Thus, when he and Joan meet again, she has no idea he's headed for a death sentence, and he doesn't know about her.
I wasn't surprised when it wasn't on anyone else's list, this is an obscure gem.
Only this movie is not a screwball comedy or a story about rich people in tuxedos chitchatting when they are not dancing.
The year 1939 is described as Hollywood's peak year, when movies like Gone With The Wind and Gunga Din were in release.
The team of Powell and Francis had appeared together in four films at Paramount before being signed by Warner Brothers in 1932 when they made this film along with another classic, "Jewel Robbery".
The novel only survived in fragments and Fellini decided when adapting the tales to not try and patch up the narrative but instead present a series of highly detailed episodes.
But Lica is decapitated by some political rivals when a new Emperor takes over.
That's when you realise Satyricon is a brilliant satire of modern society as well.
The young man's life is spared when he literally talks the Minotaur out of slaying him, in a scene which is both post-modern and subtly comical.
She keeps to herself, but the attentions of Toyama infuriate the other girls, who can't understand what he sees in her when he could have any of them.
Later when Eumolpo and Encolpio recline in the open field encased in an early morning mist, the elderly poet bequeaths to Encolpio a series of "natural" phenomena; among them mountains, rivers, clouds, love, tears, joy, sound, song and the voices of man...  During the "Matron of Ephesus" scene, a young woman mourning her deceased husband by starving to death in a cave has her chalk white face returned to its natural radiance after accepting the embrace of a handsome soldier.
Later, when he visits the elderly Enotea, she lets dirt fall from her clenched fists as if giving a silent reference to the earth element.
I saw it for the first time when it came out in 69, when I was 16.
But the film is jumpy, disjointed, disconnected; the sequences do not always arise from each other in any consistent way, leaving viewers with a sort of "what the ..." reaction when the film unexpectedly shifts without explanation.
It is disappointing when you look for information on this site and it is missing.
My brother and I would talk about when we would potentially need to make the BIG WISH.
I don't remember exactly my age when I watched it for the first time(I think I was 11) but since the time I watched for the first time until now I cannot be tired of the story!
With some funny elements and also a different plot, ''Hghway to Hell'' starts when Charlie and his girlfriend Rachel are running away from their homes to marry.
This is a warm, thoughtful, thought-provoking, heart breaking, uplifting example of what happens when great writing meets visual artistry.
Fincher has always been a Michaelangelo, a Rembrandt, a DaVinci when it comes to visuals & he at the height of his powers here.
The answer arrives when you see it because it is the only day they could have released it.
Beginning with Button's friendship early on when he befriends a little female Daisy(wonderful performance from Cate Blanchett)and many years later as Benjamin starts to gain his youth he once again meets up with Daisy along the way after she's became a successful ballet dancer and the two will develop a passionate romance and love story that anyone would dream of it was just so true and simple.
The intersection of their lives when both are substantially the same age forms the tension in the movie.
In a year when the films with the most impact (like "The Dark Knight") have been those that have tapped into the fears and mindset of the times we live in, it's rather fitting that a movie like "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" comes along at the end of the year.
It's a great high concept idea, but what do the film-makers get really out of that besides the "life is unpredictable... you never know when change is gonna come" theme that permeates the movie.
Yet that fact lends absolutely no circumstance to the entire picture until the very end of the movie when the writers needed a cheap copout in order to get out of the complete mess that they had put themselves in, it's like "Wait a minute, we can't possibly earn an Oscar if this thing actually ends happily, let's make our main character do something only a complete S.O.B.
Maybe because people are so used to seeing visual trash from Hollywood these days, when they get visual trash with some good acting, they call it a masterpiece.
Now throw in clichÃ© after clichÃ© (crazy sea captain, dancer struck down ridiculously in her prime, lovers buying a love nest and painting the walls...) and you end up feeling like you have gone on a ride, but it didn't make you feel any differently than when you got on.
I honestly thought, when I found out the immense length of the film, it was going to be boring....I was wrong, it gripped me from start to finish.
If you want to see actors when they were young this is the best rendition of effects possible, and I hope the future movies use more of this amazing technology to make their stars more bankable.
It's like a great epic from Hollywood's Golden Age, when a good story was as important as the magnificent sets (the art direction, cinematography and make-up are all fantastic, by the way, as is Alexandre Desplat's musical score) that populated them Â something very rare today, when CGI dominates most movies.
It picks up again, especially in the last minutes when "Benjamin" begins to finally become younger than an adult.
It's especially true in this story when Benjamin starts off and has a lot of old friends to begin with!
It doesn't make sense that Benjamin, when he becomes a father, decides to leave and travel the world.
He looks of the age to do something like this but he's meant to be more mature... And when he's an old man in a young boy's body, he has a tantrum like a young boy would, but that doesn't fit the idea of the story, either...
To me, it became extremely boring as there is never any deep meaning to it and it just keeps dragging on for far too long when you can see that it's quite a stupid idea to put into a film.
Most difficult situation he encounters is being left without a life jacket when the tugboat encounters a German WWII sub, which the tugboat ends up defeating with such ease and rapidity, Benjamin doesn't even have time to do anything but crouch down for a minute and hide.
We don't find out immediately that he will lead his life physically aging backwards, but it is gradually revealed as he grows older, when his back begins to take shape and his wheelchair is rendered useless.
The most interesting section is one that completely captivated: when he has a love affair with a lady at the Russian hotel, why?
Because they kept it at a brisk 30 minutes so it doesn't drag on for 2 hours, it gets you captivated, and it ends when it is meant to end.
You (or at least me) become sick of Benjamin's relationship with Daisy when you realize it fails to ask the most important question at what is the dead center of the entire 2 hour 48 minute film: Why did they fall in love???
There are many useless scenes that could've been thrown out (particularly this one scene in which it shows all the things, which could've happened to prevent Daisy being hit by a cab, which leaves you thinking in the 5-minute section that feels more like 30 minutes which left me thinking "when will this end???").
Y'just don't care about him at all... to be honest, the whole film struck me as a giant, drawn-out metaphor for a midlife crisis: a man pines after a girl who's not ready for him for years and years, then when she finally takes him into her bed, they spend a glorious year between the sheets, and as soon as responsibility shows up in the form of a child, he runs away from commitment, blaming his condition.
And then of course, when he comes back, she forgives him for being a coward and a stinker.
In such a situation, when you have to wait for someone, the last thing you want to do is fool around after waiting.
My interest was kept, I enjoyed the characters but when I started feeling lost and cheated, that I would never get any closer to the lives, feelings and deeper philosophies, and what with some of the frustrating scenes between Daisy and Benjamin, I began to grow impatient.
His loyalty pays off, though, when circumstances bring them together again at a time when they both happen to be the same age - a fleeting moment, and one they will cherish.
A possibly unintentional (I doubt it) laugh arises mid-film when Benjamin finally reaches something around Pitt's own age.
How does one fall in love when he could one day appear young enough to be his spouse's child?
How does a 5 year old play with the neighborhood children when he's confined to a wheelchair stricken with old age?
Pitt plays the character at almost every age, but it's almost impossible to tell when the CGI is being used on him.
If I had to point out one thing I would've liked to have seen a little more of, it would've been more of Benjamin as a little kid, as I felt that was rushed (for those who don't know what I mean, I mean the last parts of the film when he's old, but his body is young).
They had almost every clichÃ© in this movie that I have ever heard, the only time I laughed was when my friend told me it was a real movie and not a spoof.
For instance, in the opening scene when the the guy asks the deputy what the name of this town is and the deputy says "Suddenly."
I guess this was an attempt at humor, but the humorous part was when the camera pans back showing that the guy and the deputy are right underneath this huge roadside sign that says "Welcome to Suddenly."
My mom and I had heard that the movie was really funny, so we wanted to see it when we saw it that it was on the on demand thing through her cable company.
Most of the time when they tried to impede our (intrepid?)
What kind of sense of humor doesn't think "Take no prisoners" wasn't funny when the gals are "going after It."
"Up the Creek" just goes to show that the right elements in any movie, when they click, make the experience all the more pleasant.
But when they go to that extra trouble, it works.
This is dated in a lot of ways--the violence is extremely toned down, there's next to no blood (even when one man is shot at least 30 times!)
Normally when I see a film I'm dissapointed.
Chow Yun Fat IS the man when it comes to action and the director, John Woo, when combined with Chow Yun Fat makes a perfect movie.
Watch this movie, The Killer, and Bullet in the Head, and then cry when all the mediocre action movies and pale imitations you've been subjected to throughout the years get ruthlessly bitch-slapped across the room and forced to beg for forgiveness.
However, when a rival with greater ambition wants to recruit him, Tony double-crosses his old boss.
The film is incredibly clever for an action film, with many twists, but this is all the more astounding when you witness the level of action which takes place.
The opening scene with the shoot-out at the teahouse is remembered for when Tequila (Yun Fat Chow) does a bunch of insane stunts like firing while jumping in mid-air and when he slides down the staircase handle and shoots the bad guys without getting hit.
And then that's when Tequila shows up and kicks a ton of @$$!
And we also have some suspense and emotional to along with the action since the hospital scene is very tense with all the babies in danger when Tequila tries to save them all while narrowly dodging bullets.
Another telegraphed scene is when grandpa is talking to grandson about the voltage of the TV and the danger it would be with spilt water.
"The Killer" was one of the few films in American cinema history to receive an "X" rating for violence alone on its original release; this at a time when Director Woo was seriously considering moving to America.
Hard Boiled is given the name Most Violent Movie by many critics, when it first released.
American actionmovies like Face/Off are kindergarten, when compared to the likes of Hard Boiled and The Killer.
In this one, an undercover officer infiltrates a gangland Triad dealing arms, and when a rival gang threatens to take over, Tequila joins in the melee, and once it begins the action never stops until the last of the credits have rolled off into the recesses of the darkened screen.
Who cares whether shotgun rounds explode when they impact?
And boy, when it does, you'll have a blast!
John Woo's interests are shown through Tequila's passion of jazz and the beautiful and dark cinematography of Hong Kong, which, when combined together, gives an effect that signifies two different worlds, that is, the life of a cop and the life of a criminal.
This perfectly shot ballet of blood and bullets is an example of how great and reliable Asian movies can be, when we are finally tired of clichÃ© elements from Hollywood.
Now, when I say "works," I mean "launches thousands of bullets, slugs, and explosive projectiles into HUNDREDS of mafioso baddies."
Chow is a good actor, and Tony Leung is probably even better here -- they make the obligatory story sequences compelling, and when they start firing their weapons, you can't take your eyes away.
While most modern action films (Smokin' Aces for one) aspire to some sort of grand intelligence while providing shoot-outs and explosions, this film is a reminder of times when action films suffered no such pretensions.
But when watching a movie, the viewer must be conscious of the values of the society when the film was produced.
And if you thought Sadako couldn't be scarier than when she crawled out of the TV in Ring, sit tight - because Sadako's still got a few tricks up her elongated sleeve, including a finale that will have people of a nervous disposition reaching for the 'off' button on their remote control.
The training - and the first real laugh of the film - isn't until 47-minute mark when Buster begins training and can't get over the ropes.
Now, when I called this film my favorite by Keaton some might agrue, that's not the "correct" choice.
This sequence in the wilds contains all of the best gags: wildfowl all around but unobserved by our hero; the duck who keeps ducking under the boat when Buster is trying to get organized to shoot it; the dinner table slowly sinking in the mud; the heroine walking a lost Buster back to his camp after he has gallantly walked her home.
In "The General", we engage with Johnnie Gray almost immediately -- in "Battling Butler", Alfred remained a cipher for me until the moment when he nervously rehearses "Beatrice Faircatch"'s newspaper advice on making a proposal, with such an earnest air: it's funny, but it's also touching, and it's no coincidence that it is with his subsequent first steps towards standing on his own two feet -- tearing up and throwing aside the useless newspaper column -- that Alfred Butler may finally be said to have progressed beyond a simple one-dimensional character, and the film can really begin.
There is a brief vivid moment when Alfred, bewildered and worn out, turns his face aside into the arms of his second with such a hopeless little air that instead of a laugh, it raised a murmur of pity from the auditorium.
But, when the real Butler wins the title, Buster has a hard time pretending any longer.
In a sweet image typical of Keaton's sophisticated film-making style, when Alfred parts from his wife, as he drives away her face remains framed, like a cameo, in the oval window at the back of the car.
Battling Butler was one of Keaton's most successful movies when it was released.
The film is essentially a collection of real life situations captured during the Rolling Stones' infamous 1972 U.S. tour, when their celebrity status had reached critical mass.
This is where the clichÃ©s come from, they were the first people to do these things... And that is what you have to remember when watching this film, it is truly a snapshot in to the creation of rock and roll.
I could not believe it when I saw this in an independent music store.
Chgarlie has said this tour is when the bulls..t level reached its highest point, particularly when Truman Capote and Princess Radish show up.
From the moment Mick pops thru the curtain as it rises, and the band is blasting out Brown Sugar, till the encore when Mick leads out Stevie Wonder and his band,(the opening act)to do a killer medley of Uptight and Satisfaction, the music kicks.
Knew nothing of this film when I put it in the player, except that Goldie Hawn was central to it.
The somewhat convoluted plot has young J.R. (Keitel) feeling that he has to take charge when he learns what happened to his hubby (Zina Bethune).
America lost it's innocence on that Dallas morning over forty years ago, and I came away from this movie with the thought that maybe the film makers were subconsciously looking ahead to when such an event in modern times might not be so much conjecture, but something almost inevitable.
I refer to the series opener of 'Colt .45', when Wayde Preston defends his occupation as a traveling gun salesman - "When guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns".
The topper for me though was when Pidge fired the errant shot and threw the gun across the room, and Johnny Baron didn't bother to worry about who might go after it.
There is an early scene in this film when J.R. and The Girl are making out, passionately, and suddenly he stops.
She knows it still bothers him and when she confronts him, he admits as much.
Scorsese would move on to make Mean Streets, Raging Bull, The King of Comedy, GoodFellas, and several other movies that double, triple and demolish the impact this first work, completed with greatly impatient urgency when he was 25, but as with most independent debuts, nearly all of which overstep the bounds of self-indulgence anyway, which has yet to prove a problem for Scorsese, one must be objective with its flaws and not water down its lack of guile.
When he gets caught up with a resident girl, he fixes on settling down with her, except when he finds out that she was once raped, he cannot come to grips with it.
More overtly associated with Catholic guilt than Scorsese's latter pieces, we see what materializes when Keitel's devout guilt complex pulls alongside him.
And then, eventually, when she tells him she isn't a virgin, he is unable to cope with this and he breaks it off.
A scene late in the film, when Keitel goes to a church and kisses a nail on a crucifix and blood drips, is clumsily unnatural.
I must wonder to tell you the truth because when it comes to a night out with the great (Marilyn Monroe), and a chance to kiss her too ..HHHHOOO this is wild man..Very wild..
So when they made it as something which's less enjoyable than the ordinary life..
It's one comic so passionate movie which has no shame in presenting this obligatory phase of life when you've got to know your dream so consequently your fact !, and what a lessen the movie gives softly through its gentle manifesto : viva the 1950s, (Marilyn), the boyhood, the fictional world, and the most of all : viva the genius experiment of factual LIFE.
Except for what his sister mentions what possibly happens when someone is hanging, this might be a good educational experience for an under-12 to watch with a parent if that child wanted to know what dying was like.
it's a little hard to understand what he's say at times but when you do it's just pure magic.
not to mention none of the girls made me horny even once, but then again it was pretty cold in the apartment when I was watching it.
As a result, when Baron says he would be nothing without his gun, Sinatra's scrawny non-Hollywood appearance confirms the fact.
So fortunately-- the movie implies-- when push comes to shove, Pidge follows the men in his life and the plot fails.
He has a desperate need to show things as real as possible, even if it is a fiction story, so his camera moves like eyes most of the times, like afraid of watching what's waiting on the other side, so the impact is harder when we seed alongside the camera.
Being an aviation nut when this show was on, I couldn't get enough of it.
Minutes later he chastises her for just "being a woman" when she is concerned about him electrocuting himself when fixing a TV.
The ending is telegraphed far in advance when the little boy shoots the assassin but just barely misses, the gun-hating mom picks up the gun and shoots him but just wounds him and then the macho sheriff takes it and does what only a man can do - justifiably kill a bad man with one shot.
A deep love slowly blossoms between him and his step-sister, Thorley (Teresa Wright), but his step-brother Adam (John Rodney) gradually begins to deeply resent his presence; something that is twisted into something even darker and more hateful when Jed returns home a war hero.
***SPOILERS BEGIN***** Mitchum's paranoia is reinforced when his pony is shot out from under him by Dean Jagger, a sinister figure who is the ultimate bad penny.
There's a touch of quasi-incest when a deeply disturbed Teresa Wright and an equally deranged Robert Mitchum pledge their love only to have it turned on its head when Mitchum shoots her brother in self defense after he returns from active duty, having lost the toss of a coin, an earlier version of the draft ballot.
He was orphaned by a vengeful brother-in-law, rejected by his adoptive brother who attempts to kill him, goes willingly to a war he has no interest in, and when he does the unthinkable and kills his brother, his "beloved" rejects him outright with a scathing gesture.
Jeb's family disappeared when he was a boy - though he doesn't know how or why.
He doesn't get many breaks, a psychopath, Dean Jagger, who hates him unrealistically, attempts to kill a ten-year old but succeeds only in killing his horse; when confronted by Anderson, he spews out his hate for the boy and the 'family' he springs from and then, equally unrealistically, agrees to back off and wait til the boy grows up for his revenge.
He universally accepts his fate when he loses a coin toss.
The film is told in flashback from his childhood tragedy when his family were all murdered, with him being the only survivor.
These undercurrents are revealed when Jeb leaves to fight in the Spanish-American war, and nothing improves when he returns as a hero.
This is where the movie starts to strain credibility, especially when both Ma and Thorley turn implacably against Jeb after he kills Adam in self-defense.
And when Thorley decides to marry Jeb and kill him on their wedding night, the film starts tipping towards the ludicrous.
But they will fulfill what is in their hearts even when it means societal disapproval or death.
Plan 9 from Outer Space and Robot Monster have good production values when compared to this movie.
--that this was intended as a hoax when it was made.
Where the film truly goes off the rails is when the host begins blathering about the aliens being from planet Ummo.
The single funniest moment in this wretched film is when the narrator, serious as a heart attack, reports that the authenticity of a certain series of close-up UFO photographs was confirmed for the makers of "Overlords" by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung!
Series I: This is when it all started but it only has one of the classics, that being 'Future Echoes' which is one of my favourite episodes.
'backwards' is again a brilliant idea, they finally arrive on Earth, after going through a 'time hole', to find time's running backwards, also a new version of Holly is introduced when he performs a head swap operation on himself to become a woman, and a new character joins the crew, a service mechanoid: Kryten and a new mini craft called 'Starbug'   Series IV: This is one of the somewhat weaker series but doesn't mean that it's not a good one.
The Rimmer actor was written out in the second episode: 'Stoke Me A Clipper', when Rimmer leaves to become Ace Rimmer.
Series VIII: This is the final series when 'Starbug' is finally destroyed after a series of crashes in it's previous series and the crew is resurrected by nanobots (small robots) along with Red Dwarf and the dwarfers are placed in Jail along with the resurrected Rimmer as Chris Barrie Returns.
On a personal note, my eldest daughter was 9 years old when she first saw Lister teaching Kryten to call Rimmer a smeghead, and she laughed herself silly.
One of my favourite lines from Cat was in Series 1, episode 2, when he was to be found, sauntering over to Listers fish tank singing, "I'm gonna eat you little fishy!"
Craig Charles, when you think about it, was brilliant in the first six series.
I was 10 when I anticipated this series and was genuinely looking forward to it.
A few episodes later I was annoyed at school when everyone kept quoting it and saying it was really funny.
I'm glad it ended when it did.
While in the early series having a tiny budget used on props and the sets it still managed to produce fantastic story lines and new characters every episode, it was when they got a bigger budget(Season 3 or 4 and over) that they really let their creative style loose going to different funny dimensions, meeting equally funny new character's and with jokes about what different dimensions existed they still had great character jokes, which really made the humour of this show something to be reckoned with.
First there is Dave Lister, who is a slob but is also a deep down very caring and compassionate guy and to the writers credit, they really make it so that just when you think Dave is just a useless slob they write an episode which reveals more about that character and how he is really a good guy.
The show is set in the future and is based around the scruffy Dave Lister (Craig Charles), the pessimistic coward Arnold Rimmer (Chris Barrie), the mutant cat (Danny John-Jules) and the clumsy android Kryten (David Ross and Robert Llewellyn) and their adventures in space when they are trying to find there way home.
Countless are the times when you will be watching red dwarf and you will literally have to pause the DVD because you are laughing so much.
The performances are brilliant, and considering when Craig Charles joined the crew it was his first acting job, that's not to be underestimated.
Despite the fact that Lister's a 25 year old Liverpudlian space bum, Kryten is a robot, Rimmer is a hologram and the Cat is, well, a Cat, Rob Grant and Doug Naylor wrote every episode and every series so beautifully that I can really relate to the characters and feel like I'm a part of their world when I watch it.
Each member of the crew has their own instantly definable personality, and I just love it that even when greeting members of other civilisations, the toadying Rimmer cannot help but bluff about his high level of sophistication:   (Paraphrasing)  Rimmer: "Ah, an excellent example of modern art, no doubt.
Even though this was when they were still (pretty much) confined to the Red Dwarf ship, the scripts and dialogues were absolutely fantastic.
Then Cat (Danny John Jules) simply says "I wouldn't want to be around when one of these suckers is making a speech".
That's what many people originally thought about the comedy classic Red Dwarf when the idea was first brought up in the mid 80's.
I would have rated Red Dwarf 10/10, but unfortunately, when rating the show in its entirety, you must consider the final two seasons/series.
She is such an alive and beautiful person that it is truly painful when we see her subjected to violence.
Francis Girod began his career with a scandalous movie:Romy Schneider,who was looked upon as a Madonna by most of the FRench audience became one the most disgusting criminals an actress had ever played.Since he watered down his wine and subsequent works were much more moderate ("Lacenaire""la banquiÃ¨re") when they were not drastic failures ("descente aux enfers" " passage Ã  l'acte".
The plot is so complex it will demand several viewings.A lot of elements interfere :a serial killer who kills male and female prostitutes ,a transvestite whose father has just been arrested for pedophilia -which might or might not lead his son (Stevenin) whom he abused to lead such a life-; the "sens interdit" (one-way street) gay club where you can see a drag act , the "twin duet" featured in Demy 's "les demoiselles de Rochefort" ;elements of melodrama : the past of the characters recalls those endless novels from the nineteenth century when the characters did not know exactly who their father was;and a love the hero feels for a so-called straight mover (who's also a gigolo) .
Her interest is peaked when a handsome young Johnny (StÃ©phane Metzger) moves in next door and she fantasizes an affair with him.
I saw the film when it came out in France and am glad somebody finally decided to bring it to the United States.
I think Miss Stanwyck was a great actress, but when I look at the version of STELLA DALLAS that King Vidor directed her in twelve years after this silent version..... well, something always bothered me about it.
All right, she wasn't dressed as beautifully as she was in THE LADY EVE, but being a little bit frumpy isn't against the law, especially when you look like Barbara Stanwyck.
But when Belle Bennett dresses up in this movie, she is a well-meaning horror, wearing stripes, frills, lace, feather, rings on her fingers, probably bells on her toes..... and a fat suit.
Even if the voice I hear in my head when Miss Bennett moves her lips is that of Barbara Stanwyck.
I was unfamiliar with the story of Stella Dallas, so when I first sat down and began to watch the 1925 version, I was expecting a simple, and light hearted silent; 'a fun way to spend an hour, but will soon be forgotten', type of film.
One evening walking out of a friends home during a party when she came back in,in what seemed to be a fleeting moment,Katie finds that the party was over and that three hours had mysteriously passed by!
Hard to follow at first with a lot of sub-plots that it really could do without but when "Visitors of the Night" gets to the core or "Heart and Soul" of it's story it's very hard not to keep your tear-ducts from filling up and then spilling over.
I didn't understand why I'd never notice when movies like this are release in Mexico till I saw movies like Minotaur, Anaconda 2, Snakes on the plane/train, etc.
I like when I'm not expecting anything pleasurable or funny in a movie and then they come with this.
John Hurt was a welcome presence in this one as the aged King Rothgar, and it's always a pleasure when Ron Perlman shows up anywhere - here, he plays Rothgar's brutish rival forced to ally himself with his enemy to fight the Moorwen.
The one bone I'd pick with the effects comes when the Moorwen interacts with the human characters.
Unfortunately, he quickly ascertains one of the creatures he was battling in space has joined him when he lands.
One can see the maturity of those involved to endow us a jewel, because when you think of how the dilemmas and dramas intermix in rivalry from different clans, the characters are all blessed with the intelligent mindset of the makers of this movie.
That must have been the must stunning capture of what most movies fail in doing, when portraying a woman.
If I was 10 years old when I watched it, I would have been running around on the ceiling for months.
You never know when they will surprise you.
(I laughed my head off, when the first word he utters in Earth language is the "F" word :D) Wandering around in a forest, he is found by Wulfric (Jack Huston) and brought back to his village.
They think Kainen is responsible for brutally ransacking a nearby village, and when Kainen tells them he is hunting for a "dragon", he is labeled as a liar and enemy.
Soon, when the villagers start vanishing and turning up as mutilated corpses, the vikings realize that Kainen might be telling the truth after all...
Basically anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi Action/Adventure done well should be looking forward to checking this one out when and if they get the chance.
In 1954 when this was made, everybody was reading their lines and standing very straight but in this film Sinatra breaks those rules and shows us into the mind and heart of a man badly damaged by his war experiences.
The two female characters have strikingly different personalities - Carla is devious and cold-blooded, she does the planning and keeps her cool when things go out of hand.
She gets a bit annoying when she is constantly saying things like 'Now what?'
Why would indecisive Rachel want to kill Carla when throughout the movie it was Carla who planned and managed the whole thing and encouraged Rachel to keep at it every time she was about to chicken out?
This film's first hour does surpass all of "Aguirre: The Wrath of God" (1972) but loses something when it turns into a Conquistador "Apocalypse Now" (1979).
There seems often to be a tendency for famous entertainers to possess different personas in real life, and in instances like the above, even to emphasize them when in contrast to either more negative, or less attractive, characterizations in their roles.
and what happened to him between 1956 (when the last non-interview scene supposedly takes place) and his death 30 years later (!).
When viewing this film pay close attention to the earlier years when Gleason is a boy and the expressions used by his father around the house and in treating his mother.
One of the many cartoons from the days when Porky Pig was the top Warner Bros. cartoon star - though Daffy Duck would soon overtake him - "Porky's Railroad" looks to me like a parable of many American's hopes during the Depression.
I saw this film when it came out in 1984, and since then, have been unable to forget it.
This people truly must have more money than sense - when I was sixteen, my main occupation was keeping on top of my school work in preparation for my GCSEs, but these kids must be extremely lucky.
i mean, how do they launch anti-drug and anti-smoking propaganda, when in their shows, they promote rudeness, debauchery, heavy drinking, lavish spending, materialism, etc?
gone are the days when parents were respected authority figures.
), no responsible parents, no true friends and the list goes on BUTÂ they're SO FUNNY when they're all like "I'm the princess of whattheheckville" or "I'm the king of brainlessrichkidditown", like people REALLY gives a... care about 'em.
Whatever one thought of Sinatra he was larger than life to most of us - and I sometimes think that the 20th Century ended in 1998 when he died.
i don't know why i felt like the world is falling apart around me when i was watching this.WHat in the World has gotten to us!!!
While watching 'My Super Sweet 16', one starts to wonder what the creators were smoking when they thought of this show, and why anyone would put them self through the pain of watching this poor excuse for television is beyond me.
does anyone remember when MTV wasn't full of shows that couldn't be any less about music if they tried?
She whined when she didn't get a star for her birthday (her parents later surprised her with Lil Frankie, or some such person).
Do you really think we are jealous of people who are spoiled and bitch out their parents, are obsessed with material things and are in for a very RUDE awakening when they hit the real world?
Only cheering up when the even newer "Spider" sports-car arrives 10 minutes later with their diamond-encrusted Rolex.
A few years down the line Mtv should document the mental breakdown every single one of these sons and daughters will have when their luck runs out and they realize how pointless their existence is, or when they end up in rehab from their drug/alcohol/eating disorder issue and how they finally grow up from it.
Its a lot of fun watching the really fake shark that isn't scary at all,you will crack up when you see the shark coming out of the water with his head.
James Franciscus sleepwalks through the part of a drippy shark expert with a numbing blankness which suggests that poor Jim was severely doped up on anti-depressant drugs when he acted in this endearingly awful atrocity.
Worse, the film repeats a good many of its incidents and effects twice or more: the idiotic 'explosion' when the shark attacks from below; the heroine Â played by the director's own lovely daughter Â falling into the sea, where she's not so lucky the second time around; the dives by would-be expert shark-fighter Vic Morrow Â complete with heavy Irish brogue a' la Robert Shaw's Quint from the first JAWS Â to destroy the creature both fail miserably, the second time getting tangled up in ropes and being dragged Ahab-like by the shark; characters get bitten in halfÂto say nothing of the ultra-fake blue-eyed[!]
; some of these were genuinely unsettling, to be sure Â but, while this practice may be forgiven when viewed in excessively dark prints (as some online reviewers have complained), it wasn't in the surprisingly clean edition that I came across only recentlyÂ   James Franciscus has the lead role here; for the record, he had played a villain in another Italian JAWS rip-off Â or, more specifically, PIRANHA (1978) Â i.e.
It's ironic, then, that this movie was itself ripped off by the makers of both JAWS 3-D (1983) and JAWS: THE REVENGE (1987), the vastly inferior concluding episodes in the Universal saga: as in the latter, the shark is depicted as an intelligent animal (such as when it systematically pursues the entire line-up of surfers without killing them only to then vent its anger on the man leading them in a boat and, again, when it tries to bury our two heroes inside a cave by crashing repeatedly into a rock-face and barring its exit with the falling stones!
I read the cover describing it as a real success at the 80's and how mad Spielberg was when the movie got released.
In terms of the shark itself, for when it is seen, just like in Spielberg's classic, it was done through a mechanical shark and live footage.
Its a lot of fun watching the really fake shark that isn't scary at all,you will crack up when you see the shark coming out of the water with his head.
I was surprised when i watched this movie, it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be in fact it was quite good.
i was also surprised when i read that it was released as Jaws 3 in some countries when it hit the theaters, well it is better than Jaws pt 3 and 4. one thing that i like with this movie (spoiler warning) is the ending - right about after the sharks death - when they all get safety on land just before the end text is coming and the sad music is appears - it reflects sorrow, evil and even madness, and the survivors gets into the car - it is a great scene probably the best in the entire movie (according to me).
Vic Morrow does his best Robert Shaw impression when a 35 foot (yes, 35 foot) great white infiltrates a popular tourist beach and starts eating windsurfers and other ditzy people who like to fall off boats into the water whenever they see a giant shark fin circling.
The Last Shark starts off well, slumps slightly in the middle, and picks up again towards the end when Joshua Sinclair tries his hand at fishing the shark out the water using a helicopter.
The shark itself is an engaging creation, even though it's over-the-top gigantic and a little too robotic-looking when it pops out of the water.
Just make sure the parents are asleep and that you've got the right kind of friend in tow when watching it.
This makes it even harder work piecing together the mystery when 'all is revealed' (there are a number of interpretations to the central mystery).
The big clue is when the mother and daughter discuss the rules of servants.
A further clue is when they are eating.
He is nicknamed "Singapore Sling" by the pair, is tied to a bed, and is humiliated in various ways (one particularly interesting one being when the Mother urinates in his face while administering electroshock.)
In fact, the film is so damned pretty that even morbidly sick practises such as a mother having lesbian sex with her daughter don't seem quite so grotesque when seen in this film.
Singapore enters the picture when he goes poking around the womens' house looking for a woman named Laura who he encountered a while back and has become obsessed with.
Other sexual episodes are depicted in delicious detail and the film does not hesitate to go totally hardcore when necessary.
What do you get when you cross Preminger's LAURA with the Kuchar/McDowell brain-frier THUNDERCRACK!?
This is the type of movie you get when giving a camera to a bunch of drunken fat guys that watched way too much porno in their lives.
The absolute low point was when the camera zoomed in on the girls as they were washing their vagina after being raped several times.
That's what makes Wrong Way all the more disappointing; it's not a bad thing to rip off Craven's film, but when all you've got is a series of sex scenes, you know that it hasn't been done well.
It is really astonishing when one thinks that, unlike today, there actually was a movie-making climate which allowed for films like Wrong Way to be made and put in real movie theaters.
But the men ... Now, I can enjoy a naked guy as much as a naked girl but when they are all about 50 years old, obese, beer-bellied and sporting greasy hair and silly mustaches I get turned off.
This movie despite being based on the experiences of an elite US naval frog team at war is surprisingly value-neutral when it comes to extolling the virtues of the US military, or even the reasons for going to war.
I played it sometimes when I visited friends that owned it.
The ending is anticlimactic since there is no tension when one party is the living Buddha (or something like that).
It probably had happened in real life when there was a strong attraction, but she was basically feeling pity for his mother and so decided to give her virginity to him.
Among the funniest scenes are when characters are attempting to not be seen by moving about in the open in very conspicuous fashion.
Another point of humor: when characters are chasing other characters in fight scenes, the chasers are often on wires and hop down the bunny trail towards their opponents.
She never smiles in this film or shows any emotional content when she fights.
The ending is less about Buddha (in fact THROUGHOUT the whole film when characters' gaze perpetually hint at a mythic, towering world order and all-enveloping consciousness larger than their conflicts or King Hu could cram on screen), than such spiritual path as critique of all the commotions that preceded it - and made up the film.
And even when they occur, the style is often serving the story and Hu's point (i.e.
***********Spoilers*********************  TOZ is the second only to 36th chamber when it comes to making a Buddhist monks look badass.
Three hours will fly by when you catch King Hu's amazing, spectacular "A Touch of Zen", possibly the greatest feat in the history of martial arts film-making.
Once there was a time when I thought Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was the very best martial arts movie man could make.
Ku's life gets a little more interesting when he notices strange people walking around town, a mysterious man visiting his studio and befriending him, and some strange noises coming from a house that is rumoured to be haunted.
I know it isn't real; some leaps and moves the characters make just can't be done in real life, but the clanging of the steel, swooshing of people's clothes when they perform their moves and the sound of footsteps are so impressive that I found myself holding my breath at some scenes.
The fighters are really observing each other's moves to know when to strike.
Any yawning I did was due to the late hour when I was watching this.
The director really knew what he was doing since all the important scenes have that special quality to them that can only be acquired when superb direction, believable acting and a great sense of situation come together.
King Hu certainly lived up to his name, when crafting this piece of art that deserves even more respect and admiration than it has already had.
All you could want in a film is here - tension, action, arty filmwork, a kind of love interest, action, beautifully choreographed fights, intrigue, action, comedy, philosophy.... and a monk who is so pure that when he is wounded he bleeds.... well, you'd better see for yourself what he bleeds.
The story shifts to six years ago, when Lorenzo and a woman, without knowing even the name of each other, have a magnificent sexual intercourse.
It is only when you look back that you realize just how cleverly King Hu has created those three sections.
Especially when you can't understand 90% of the dialogue, and what you can hear is the same lines over and over.
I'll start off by putting all my cards on the table, I'm a big Command & Conquer fan and am extremely biased when looking at any other type of RTS game.
So she leaves him though she knows she is still in love with him, and then her world shatters when she hears he is dead.
For the moment, however, Lucia's "loss" will make her cycle in Lorenzo's world, and when she moves to Lorenzo's island, the island Lorenzo would never take her to, she is really inside the hole he was in (she falls into a real cave in the island, as well).
The book that conceived Luna also made Lucia fall in love with Lorenzo, the shot of their first union cuts into Luna's birth, they both dropped into a hole together, and at the end, when Elena tells Lucia that she is a gift to the earth, she looks as happy as she would if she got back her lost child.
The soundtrack fits the atmosphere well, when traversing the cold vacuum of space it only lends to the atmosphere when you here the creepy tunes of starcraft.
The better part of them are essentially the same, when you break them down to basic elements: Build up a base, collect credits through some kind of natural(or unnatural) mineral, build an army and defeat the opponent who has more or less the same type(s) of army/units/buildings as you.
Usually, when playing single player in a RTS game, you have to lead the army you've chosen to victory... the campaigns contradict each other, or simply don't relate to one another.
The psycho haunts the rooms, hidden behind his prey who wander aimlessly trying to survive as he captures them one by one when certain individuals make the mistake of getting separated.
A list containing the names of the group given an invite are labeled with specific titles(Kathy-loser, Nicole-heartless, Adam-pig, etc)and when each victim is dispatched a red X is marked through them.
This movie didn't even satisfy my B horror movie cravings and I can deal with even cheese with gore but they were actually serious when attempting to create a "HORROR" movie.
So when I went to watch it for the first 10 minutes I began to get a little discouraged.
I think that a filmmaker who decides to make a slasher flick has two choices : having a lot of faith on the screenplay and to trust that he found a new perspective for making that formula interesting or making a completely mercenary film which is full of clichÃ©s for finally making a cheap movie.The crappy film Steel Trap belongs to the second style.The slasher films became popular thanks to Halloween (1978) and Friday the 13th and,since of that,we have seen hundred of movies with similar structures,characters and story.The details change,so every slasher movie tries to be different by using a curious location or a new mask,just to mention two examples.I do not pretend to find a lot of originality on slasher films but what I pretend to find is even the minimum effort for giving the known formula a special element,making it interesting and entertaining.Steel Trap could have chosen that difficult point but,instead of risking,director and co-screenwriter Luis CÃ¡mara and co-screenwriter Gabrielle Galanter wasted that opportunity so Steel Trap is a tedious experience with an extremely weak screenplay,repulsive characters,a boring and generic killer without any personality and a forced and arbitrary ending.I usually do not like to criticize an independent film from my favourite genre but,even on some incompetent works (like Return to Sleepaway Camp),I appreciate some energy and enthusiasm which on some way compensate some fails of the movie.But Steel Trap does not even have that.Plus,to add more negative things,CÃ¡mara's direction is completely insipid.In other words,it seems nobody involved on this movie was really interested on it.The characters are so repulsive that I was glad when the killer started to kill them.Steel Trap is a very crappy film.This is one of that movies in which I feel I really lost the time with it and that's the worst sin a movie can make.If you wanna see a very good modern slasher flick,I recommend you the Norwegian movie Fritt Vilt.Skip Steel Trap,a very bad horror film.
But when he actually narrated the beginning as to who worked on the film, "I'm like, are you serious?"
I was five years old when I was in Tel-Aviv, and I remember it being beautiful and modern.
Everyone says this movie is bad, of course it is... do you think the people were actually serious when they made it?
Not some dreamy-eyed American mass-culture Silhouette-novel type of love, but real, practical love that demands rigorous action when the stakes are down.
The man is tempted on all sides to compromise his, so this film becomes the story of his struggle not to (in one scene he becomes enraged when scalpers buy up the remaining 10 yen concert tickets that he and his date wanted and start re-selling them for 15 yen).
For example when girl leaves the room and Yuzo walks around frustrated the camera doesn't move.
And it ranks #26 out of 30 when listed by ratings.
The elevator soon becomes a HELLEVATOR when a young, nervous police officer enters with two extremely dangerous prisoners moments before the aforementioned large explosion causes him to be distracted long enough for the prisoners to get the upper hand and wreak havoc.
Still, there are some nice dreamlike special effects shots when Luchino enters the minds of her fellow passengers and the frequent gore effects were done fairly well.
There also happens to be a little explosion, a little explosion caused by the cigarette that Luchino dropped when being pursued by surveillance for having an illegal substance, which doesn't particularly mix well with some fuel that got spilled.
What could happen if the elevator were to stop on a psychotic prisoners level, sending them to be disposed of is what we get to see and how things can go completely bizarre when you involve telepathic powers, violence, rape, and gore all into one enclosed elevator.
Everyone else goes just insane enough to be believable if not over the top but hell, when you see deaths like they do how can you not lose your mind!
Evolution succeeds because it is such a simple explanation; ID succeeds when the simplicity of Evolutionary theory fails to account for the evidence.
But when they lose the veneer of a "blind obsession with the truth", scientists lose all credibility.
Whether you believe in ID or don't, when it comes to whether ID should be taught in science class, it is clearly unreasonable to think that it ought to be, because science is a completely different way of looking at the world than that implied by ID.
for not really getting organized, not engaging in politicking, not being charming when in the public eye, insulting the other side and acting as though the subject is not worthy of debate rather than respecting its dignity and engaging in reasonable debate, and for not really explaining to the public its position and exactly why it's a bad idea to "teach" ID in science class.
It seems to be of the viewpoint that somehow the standard position for a pro-ID person to take is that ID ought to be taught in science class, when in reality this is just an incredibly radical and idiotic position that most pro-IDers cannot possibly subscribe to.
Honestly, I'm not even sure it really matters which camp a person finds themselves in when it comes to their spirituality.
He's a sharp guy, and he's pleasant and polite, and when he's negative about something it's in a gently ironic way.
It's okay when the film maker inserts himself into his work as narrator.
I am not a scientist, but when it comes to books, magazines, etc., I am more likely to pick up something about science than anything else.
I also love movies, so when a movie about Science comes along, I will see it.
Things begin to change when Jakob, summoned by the commandant, overhears a radio bulletin.
Things are complicated for Jakob when his friends start to believe that the bulletin came from a radio that Jakob owns - a radio which doesn't exist - and begin to hound him, some for more information, and some because they want him to destroy it before it destroys them.
i didn't remember the name until i looked up movies he starred in and when i did it came to me by seeing the list.
As a serious actor he is simply unexceptional and his attempts at such are especially disappointing when compared against his true ability.
It is a really good film to watch alone, when you are in a sensitive mood, ready to accept and understand the emotions and feelings of the characters.
The tag line "when there was no hope, he invented it" is very fitting for this movie.
Having said that, Jakob the Liar is fiendishly good, creatively done, and Robin Williams does a fine job, even when Hannah Taylor-Gordon, who plays Lina, wasn't stealing every scene she was in.
The movie twisted and turned so much that I found myself carefully paying attention to every little detail only to realize that when the film ended absolutely nothing was accomplished.
The dialogue, when occasionally present, is carried by sparse words and heavy pauses.
I haven't read the other reviews but seeing that the average was 2.2 when I first brought the rating up was kind of shocking.
Well, I was driving down the road a couple months ago and decided to Google up my childhood best friend from when I was 11-12.... Eric Byler.
On the other hand, some of the dialog is obvious, especially when it comes to Michael's expression of his feelings toward Darcy.
One can experience something very unique when examining films that analyze basic human behavior.
this version aired in the 80's when i was just around 10 years old, i remember so well watching with my mother and loving it so much because we had the soundtrack with Robert Goulet singing...he kissed my mother at a concert in Edmonton when she was a young girl...tragic that the world only knows the gene Kelly version...he is not an issue, just the whole movie, all dancing and the singing is weak.
I was only about 13 when I saw it and have never been able to view it since then.
I saw this film when it was shown on TV, and I really enjoyed it immensely.
I have remembered this movie being on TV when I was a child and have never forgotten it.
I was only three when this aired and I don't remember having seen it, but I do have the cast album and it is tremendously good.
I had to laugh though, although many complain about the gratuitous female nudity, this film did slip with the editing of the male nudity, making that seem gratuitous - but in an era where all the Hollywood actress spend half a movie naked and having sex with fully clothed men, it was nice just to see some male nudity (when was the last time you saw a post-80s Hollywood movie with as much male bare chest as in Ben Hur?!)!
I'm from Scotland, & the Kelly version just didn't have it, even although it was entertaining, but the 1966 Goulet version was more realistic & caught the essence of the highlands, I know because, I was a youth hostel member & my happiest memories are when my group of mates & I would travel all over the highlands, magic.
I am another one who remembers this wonderful production when I was a child.
Sometimes when you see a movie you haven't heard of on the video store shelf you find a gem, but not this one.
it does so through dramatic overused cliches, sub-par acting and laughable musical accompaniments to "enlighten" the viewer when to discern the dramatic moments.
the premise of the movie is basically, "what happens when you give hot chicks who love sex guns?"
well, i do know what it's like, and i think it's pathetic that these girls pretend to be feminists when they define themselves by how many guys they've slept with or what sorts of guys they've slept with.
This film has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever, which makes you wonder what the New York Independent Film & Video Festival was thinking when it gave this crap the Audience Award.
Also the actors feel a bit low on expressions, which doesn't really contribute when i already had trouble feeling anything at all about the movie.
That's when his wife and fellow world renown singer, Anna Albert, arrived.
That's when a bandaged gorilla on crutches appears for a showdown...  Swiss Miss, another brilliant musical/comedy with Laurel and Hardy.
I'm talking about the moments when the boys are drilling holes in the floor, when they have to do the dishes and when they have to push a piano across a canyon.
The movie is filled with moments which reminded me of their best years, that were unfortunately already behind them when they made this movie.
I mean when you already have 2 characters such as Laurel and Hardy, you just don't need no other characters who play a just as prominent role in the movie as the two boys.
For me the best part of the movie is when the boys go to serenade the chambermaid (complete with Stan playing the tuba).
The trouble arises from the long stretches when they are missing, while the romantic subplot threatens to swamp the boat.
You know you are in trouble when Laurel and Hardy don't make their appearance in this film until the six minute mark!!
Clive Anderson, as host, remained dignified even when he was the butt of the jokes, and the improvisers themselves have unbelievably quick wits.
I remember when Mike McShane and Josie Lawrence did a song styles and the song was about kitty litter.
The best performance ever had to be when Josie Lawrence and Caroline Quentin sung a duet about a beached whale.
I watched this film when it screened during the 2006 Toronto Film Festival, and I couldn't stop laughing at Spencer Spector's get up.
The sweet, innocent side of her was never suspected when I first glimpsed the malevolent presence of Sadako in the first installment.
The excitng scenes in the woods and cabin show how deadly Sadako can be when her evil side has control.
The weird appearance and way of walking from the first "Ring" is seen again here and there's some great bonesnapping moments when Sadako hunts down her final prey.
The documentary proved extra interesting when it analyzed the often censored "Emmanuelle In America".
It is a very slow-moving, dark, oppressive film, and should only be viewed when the viewer is prepared for a contemplative, surrealistic journey; in spite of its short length (about 25 minutes), it is a very compact film, and can feel quite draining, emotionally.
This is literalised when his arousal becomes unbearable, and he begins whipping a prisoner.
At first I started to crack up because he was insulting this guy taking his picture, which to me when a comedian includes the audience and insults them it really makes the performance a very funny one.
Pryor pours everything he has into it, whether it be recreating a heart attack onstage, demonstrating the correct method for falling over when knocked out, delivering the most perfectly timed gag about a hunting rifle, or an amazing moment where he becomes a child lying about a breakage which I absolutely guarantee will have tears streaming down your cheeks.
I was in high school when this film was released and must have seen it 5 times the first month it was out.
Made my jaws sore, almost gagged and lost my popcorn when I saw it in the theater.
Things start off quite slow but as the story develops the story gets more and more complicated and non-linear, when the line between fiction and reality gets blurred more and more.
It helps to tell the story and plays a significant role in the story lines and help to indicate when things are truth or fiction.
The beauty of his comedy is that you think he is just telling stories when in actuality he is introducing a variety of premises which contain well crafted jokes and characters who bring the visual images to life.
Other outstanding bits include white people (I'm white) acting tough, white people being nice when black people are around, women going to the bathroom in the woods, his heart attack, his father dying having sex, him having sex, his pet monkey, and a long bit about boxing with jokes about Muhammad Ali and Leon Spinks.
But when you watch this film it is of interest to realize that at the time it was filmed there was no "Def Comedy Jam."
I am 34 year old and i was 6 years old when this concert was filmed in 1979,i saw it as a little boy and countless times until this day,i am so lucky to have been born in Richards Generation to have had the opportunity to witness this man come on stage with all of his imperfections and personal problems and share it with me and the rest of the world in a way where it makes us laugh.
One of the best things I notice about his style is that you are never aware when he has moved on to the next joke.
Because I went to the theater with a negative mind, I was waiting that when would this movie go wrong as described by reviews.
Songs were dull and slow when I heard them in my car but when I saw them in the movie I liked them very very much.
I didn't knew about it before I went to the movie and when he was flashing it, I thought he cannot drop that but to my fear he actually did.
I was really excited about Saawariya when I first heard about it, but then my enthusiasm waned when I saw the promos for OSO.
this is a beautiful and amazing work by SLB .I rate this as the best movie of SLB as iv being a fan of his movies since his debut with hamoshi each and every movie is different from one another and from all other movies made in bollywood .. when he remade decdas many tried their hands with umrao jaan , don and sholay but no one succeeded becos its not that everyone can make a great story into a great movie.as for the time its only SLB who have done this.
Ranbir Kapoor does a commendable job as Raj,a kind hearted charming boy,who comes in a town for work.Love strikes him when he sees Sakina(Sonam Kapoor),a beautiful young lady.Sakina has her own past.she had been waiting for her love.Raj is heartbroken on knowing her story but he continues to be her friend.
Also, it emphasizes the contrast in society: when the whole city of prostitutes yearns for love (because they are not loved by anyone), the Prince of Love gives his heart to a woman, who already has the love of another person.
All of the main characters have an unconditional, unselfish love for another, including the heroine; until the last minute when she loses faith in the promised return of her mysterious hero, but whose fears are unfounded.
She thinks that she likes Raj but the same time when she thinks of Imaan, she starts looking for him.
Just when Ranbir is about to express his true feelings to her, she reveals the reason behind her unhappiness.
Remember those days when your grandma or mom tells you a story about fairy world?
I feel ashamed that following an over-flooding of my head with bad reviews on this movie, I actually watched it only when I was dragged to the cinema by a friend who believes in SLB more than me.
While we'll have to wait and see how the newbies fair on the spectrum of acting when they do other films with hopefully varying roles; but for a start they completely make you believe in their characters in Saawariya.
A treat not just for your eyes but for your ears too and it will even leave you with a warm thought when the credits roll at the end.
we say we want different films now but when a director attempts a different film, we absolutely bash it and end up taking out as many flaws as we can.
when we look at a painting, we don't look at where it is sitauted, we look at it's beauty and this exactly what saawariya is, it is a beautiful painting and we should be looking at it's beauty.
O's repression and sense of honor make him the sympathetic rival, particularly when it becomes clear that he isn't restrained from engaging his enemy, but rather he doesn't know how to act on his own behalf.
My aunt made a really funny comment when we watched this movie.
Still, it is lots of fun, and I was torn between giving it a 7 or an 8 (which is usually the quandary I face when rating stylish, empty movies).
There are cars that blow up when shot, pistols that are accurate at 500 yards and huge shotguns that appear from beneath short leather jackets but even with these clichÃ©s the action set pieces created by Johnny To are exciting, fast paced, very violent and seamlessly shot and edited.
The History of the last 200 years has told us that when poverty reaches a certain level, worker's Revolutions occur using Marxist ideologies to fuel the uprising.
Here, a Democratically Elected government was removed from power by a US/UK backed coup when they revealed plans to nationalise the Iranian Oil Company (Better known as BP).
I was about 7 years old at the time, I remember it was right after Disney Channel had aired "Barcelona '92: 16 Days of Glory", meaning I had Olympics on the brain when I first saw it, a bit of a bias.
This film should have gotten better treatment when it was first released...
I'll conclude with one final statement: If you thought a staggering, ghostly Sadako was intimidating, wait until you see her when she's alive and kicking, and more powerful than she ever was as an ethereal presence.
I first saw ANIMALYMPICS back in the day when HBO was first getting started.
I would see it pop up here and there on NBC around Olympic time or when they needed to fill in space in a really cruddy hour version.
But Cherry, Harry and Raquel was completely shot when the lab ruined over half the footage.
I like it when you can't die too easily, and I like it when you can't ruin the game by forgetting something or doing something wrong the first time.
He actually did appear in one years later when he was much older and the bad guy in that one.
Our family found it a favorite when it first came out - and now that I am retired I still enjoy having a laugh at it now and then.
While younger viewers may not know of Vincent, or wonder why anyone cares about a "second rate actor", there was a time when many movie fans felt that Vincent could have been a major box office draw.
There is an Australian making fools of the pirates when they do the insult sword duel and he seems to have an evil scheme.
I watched this movie when I was a kid 20 years ago.
I mean, just when you think the movie can't get any worse, it passes all expectation by becoming even more unbelievably stupid by the minute.
It was made to make fun at - where is the real Ed Wood when you need him.
Needless to say, when the entire top of a building blows up, you can expect that Ms. Porcupine did not even get singed even though she was standing about a foot away from the Giant Spider.
In the beginning, the movie looked promising (when the spiders were still small), but as it progressed it got worse and worse.
My advise to everybody: don't rent or buy it, but watch it when it is shown on television.
And I have to warn you about the ending: when you just don't think it can get any worse...
Bad acting, lame plot, lame special effects (i dont know what the previous guy who commented on this movie was watching when he said it had good special FX, all I saw was one big blue-screen with a goofy spider)cheesy dialogue(with the exception of "armor piercing, my ass!
This movie was recently shown on the Sci-Fi Channel much to my delight as I really didn't want to rent this when it came out on video because the box cover made it look like cheap straight-to-video trash.
One of the most hilarious scenes happen right here - when a 'computer-generated' leg of the spider comes out of the man's mouth.
This huge plastic-looking Halloween prop was skittling around the walls, and when the three kids are hiding in that room and the spider starts banging on the other side of the window in the door, I swear I could see the stick holding it up!!!!
)The special effects were kinda cool but a total waste of money when combined with this lame half witted story.
The movie starts off with three nerds who decides to sneak into nowhere for some reason, and then a space craft hits the ground (when I say space craft, I mean a cheap 99p rocket bought from the Early Learning Centre) and they see a mutated crew member who was impregnated with a spider, which was mutated by, yes, you guessed it.
Then, they fly over the city and an anti-climax follows where the spider gets blown up and then the film immediately finishes when everyone goes "yay".
The actors are totally uninspiring, and in one scene, the woman geek's hair style changes when shes in a lift.
Although she lived to be 91, Dame Wendy was only in her mid-70's when this series was made; her character is in her mid-80's.
wow it realy makes a change to see a quite lowbudget non cinema release movie thats this good its full of suspense and to be quite honest (some may not agree) the sfx are very good the spider is very well computerised and looks very very realistic the only downfall is when it gets to the size of a building the spfx arnt bad but their not very good but thats expected with these kinda films anyway rent or buy it it is actualy quite good  7/10
Even the performances are all pretty good, at least as far as these "B" movies go, although the script gets progressively more desperate as the movie goes on, particularly during the excellent TARANTULA style finale when the giant spider wreaks havoc in the city.
contains spoilers the govenment is carrying out experiments on a spider and injecting it with alien DNA but when a sola flare hits the space craft were the experiment is taking place the spider escapes and begins to kill of the crew one by one then laying egges in a surviver with boldging bodyparts the special effects really get going when the spider comes out of the hosts mouth and begins to attack anyone in its path including three nosey college newspaper reporters the spider is finaly killed but not before laying egges in its creater ( some phsyco messed up bloke) who when the students get out of the lab underground find there boss dead and the phsyco bloke sitting in there seat then the spider is born.
Unless you're an easily amused teenager with poor judgment, you instinctively steer clear from these kinds of pictures when looking for chills and thrills.
The CGI was decent at times, yet laughable in some parts (especially when the spider was running around walls etc).
Al Jolson made cinematic history in 1927, when he sang some songs & ad-libbed a few lines of dialogue, in the motion picture THE JAZZ SINGER - the first feature film with audible dialogue.
The only scene with any interesting action occurs when the woman freaks out and strangles her boyfriend.
Cue a reversal of fortune when she lands the job of props mistress in a production of 'Romeo and Juliet' and falls under the spell of a sensuous red cloth which, as spooky professor Perkins points out, is an original Aztec witchcraft cloak; and which she transforms into a dress, with murderous results.
One of the things I remember well is when she is dying, and her cat stays with her on the bed all day , she comments that the cat will stay until she is ready to die.
old when I saw the movie and I do remember being deeply touched.
It was from when she was a kid from in 1974, a way long time ago, so i really didn't think much of it.
She went on to explain how it was such a good book and it was based on a true story and she had many memories of it from when she was about my age.
This is the best book I've ever read, I'm just about finished it, but I really want to see the movie and I was very upset when i found out they never made a tape of it or anything and you cant find it anywhere, not on ebay, or amazon, or at blockbuster.
I like all the comments that Ihave read praising this wonderful film the tear's just flowed from my eye's when I first saw this beautiful story being so brilliantly portrayed and with such wonderful music of john Denver I still have the sound track of the film MCF 2566 ON VINAL Ilove to sit and listen to the song Sunshine on my shoulders.
I was only 8 years old and cried harder than I had ever cried before when I saw this movie.
I saw this movie when I was 16 years old in a theatre back home in Saskatchewan and have never forgotten it!
In short, All Passion Spent is an clear example of what television can be when those involved care enough to bring all their best, unselfishly, to a project.
Another I'd buy five (5) copies for sure... one for each of my three daughters, (only one was born when the movie was made) and keep two for myself!!!
My parents were not too pleased when they came home to find me watching this real life sad story.
This film made a huge impact on me when I saw it as a child.
I now have a stepdaughter the same age I was when I first saw this movie and I only wish she could view it too.
I saw this movie when it first aired on television many years ago.I was around fourteen years old.My sister was sick with breast cancer,and it made a huge impact on me.I read the book later, after I had seen the movie.This movie was beautifully filmed, and I thought that it stayed close to the original book.The script was very intelligent, and the actors portrayed their roles perfectly.I love the sets.To see the beautiful countryside in some of the scenes was fantastic.The music in this movie was one of the wonderful attributes to the story.I find myself humming the songs all of the time, after all of these years.I found the soundtrack, and I listen to it all of the time.Cliff De Young, Christina Raines,Meg Foster,Billy Mumy and Brenda Vaccaro were excellent.The other cast members were great too.I always cry when I watch this movie.I recommend this movie highly to people that have never seen it,I have this movie.
I saw it when it came out in the eighties and I have it in vivid memory as an extraordinary experience.
I saw this movie when I was a teenager and I absolutely loved it.
We've remarked that not only was the acting superb (and very *natural*, which was rather amazing when considering that many of the actors were relative "unknowns" at that time), but also the *action*; it's like we're literally right there with the officers.
But all is forgiven when we consider the other episodes.
A couple of years later when 'Schindler's List' was to premiere on network TV Spielberg pulled it from ABC and gave it to a different network.
It was hanging in there with the ratings game when the axe fell.
It's the warmth you feel when you get a gift from your best friend that says they really know you as opposed to the "warmth" of getting exactly what you asked for on your Christmas list.
Episode two, where Lady Slane learns that Mr Fitzgeorge fell in love with her when they were young, but never revealed his love, is a triumph, and reduces me to tears every time I watch it.
It's just eight reels of dull, ill-paced talk (where was Alfred Hitchcock when they needed him?
Everyone I've showed this to has agreed with me on this: This film looks like crap when you first turn it on.
But it bothers me when people see movies like this and label them as being weird just for the sake of being weird.
It's the story of a young man named Ian (McCarthy) whose brother Danny (Jeffrey Nordling) marries a flighty young woman named Lucy (Parker) very shortly after meeting her at his post office window, when she wants to mail a bowling ball.
One night, when his own date is ruined because Lucy doesn't come home as promised, Danny returns first and drives Ian home.
The movie is about what you do when you're a good person who has made an irrevocable mistake.
And then at the end when you find out that the movie is actually based on one real incidence, your reaction is just WHAAATTTT?
I don't have any other question to ask you, but I really hope you are surrounded by some honest friends who would have courage to tell you the truth when and if at all you decide to make a comeback as a director.
He tries to forget her but can't and this scene is very nicely pictured when he is America, with title song.
The scene when Irfan is standing in tower and sees airplane is also good.
Having known nothing about the film, I was a bit suspicious when they tell us the year 2001 in the first frame of the film.. and it all came to me when Irrfan Khan sat in the office with the calendar behind him.
Too bad I was too little to witness any of Queen's concerts when Freddie Mercury was still rocking the Earth.
Instead, they fly in on the helicopter when the concert starts.
I hate when people like you who obviously know nothing about talent try to judge!
It is an amazing experience, made all the more powerful when you realize how ALIVE Freddie was back then.
90% of the available movies are made by the same people, featuring the same actors, boring and completely without merit when it comes to originality and style.
That's why it makes me so happy when, once in a long while, i get to see a movie like this one.
Bela Lugosi's role really isn't very interesting and he is much better when playing more bizarre characters (Murder Legendre - White Zombie, Dracula, Dr. Carruthers - The Devil Bat).
I had thought I would be one of many extras, but when I turned up outside the backpackers that morning I was the only one.
Lugosi fared much better in the similarly-themed INTERNATIONAL HOUSE (1933) which was a most pleasant surprise for me when I caught up with it late last year via Universal's W.C. Fields DVD set.
I am always amazed when I find yet another ultra-low budget film starring Bela Lugosi.
James Houghland, Charles Hill Mailes,is an idealist when it comes to his new invention of being able to transmit a TV signal across the world.
Undeveloped characters, giving the audience a "who cares" feeling when someone gets murdered.
Things get even more convoluted when our team receives word the mine needs the cannon, like, now because some miners are trapped and - cue ominous trumpets - Forster's brother is among them.
Like Fritz Lang,Nicholas Ray put the blame on the society.Nick was born under a bad sign ,like many of the director's heroes.John Derek gives an intense performance climaxing in the scene in the court when his wife's suicide is revealed.Bogart shines as his lawyer (he's more convincing in this kind of part than he was in "marked woman").
Excellent screenplay with a superb editing ;many contemporary movies (such as the brilliant "Usual suspects" ) might have been influenced by the first scenes.Note that the story begins during the cast and credits ,which shows that Ray ,when he was on top of his game,did not know filler.
The moral is, all people have value, whether poor or old, and when one is entrusted with the care or safety of another, one should treat that life as if it were his own in all cases.
Not the best movie, but, when looked at from more than an entertainment perspective, it does its job well.
* A compulsory nude scene with one of the above exotic ladies showing off her butt and boobies when getting out of bed.
On the verge of becoming a partner in his big-time law firm, Morton is yanked out of his ivory tower and into the past by the need to defend accused murderer Pretty Boy Romano (John Derek), who he attempted to help when Romano was a petty teenage criminal.
Filmmakers like Otto Preminger and Sidney Lumet would later go on to prove that when it comes to courtroom dramas, it's better to relate to the killings through word of mouth rather than showing it either as a prologue or a flashback, for it just seems to get in the way and there is far more drama that can be generated by the actors relating to this event none of them have seen.
So when a rag-tag posse chasing the convicts rescue her, she insists on traveling with them.
One of nurses working for Wilson Fisk also know as the Kingpin is told to kill her and that night when she goes to Daredevil shows up and stops her.
Rex Smith isn't bad as Murdock/Daredevil but he's just too damn silly when he's fighting the good fight.
Another goof was the fact that David Banner had a beard in the first half of the movie, but the beard vanished when he became the Hulk, only to magically reappear when he reverted back to Banner.
The worst Hulkout was when he wakes up and you don't even see the Hulk, but merely the aftermath of his rampage as he breaks out of jail.
But as the story progresses, things get reversed when Banner becomes the positive one and has to get his friend back up from his depression.
The other Banner is when he shaves off the beard and remembers his skills as a doctor and helps Matt Murdock back into shape morally and physically.
To my taste Scream of Stone is a terrible bore: soap-like acting with a clichÃ© deep-voice performance of Sutherland, a clichÃ© thin story based on the clichÃ© opposition of intuitive versus experienced climbers, a failure to attain the clichÃ© excitement of cliffhangers even even when the cliffs are at their steepest.
Some of the actors are real (and good) climbers and one gets a glimpse of the climbing ethics (or lack thereof when sponsors come into the field).
The meanest of the three hombres is sacking the ranchhouse when Sarah enters and is immediately taken.
In this case, it's not presented at all, Templeton literally walks out to the door to go to work, we go to commercial, and when we come back he's dropped off more than 30 years in the past, but this episode still has more layers of meaning than any other episode of the show I've seen so far.
It's an interesting analysis of how people change over the years, both from who they were when they were younger and, unfortunately often, from the person they have chosen as their life partner.
Also fun was seeing Sydney Pollack when his hair was still dark.
I saw this movie in the theaters when it came out, which would have made me only seven years old!
In slow-motion they are shoved into an elevator and when it starts to go all the way down, the opening-credits come on and slow-motion shots of the elevator rattling and shaking continue.
All that is pretty entertaining already, but the real fun starts when they discover a vampire bat inside the facility.
So, all-in-all CHOSEN SURVIVORS is pretty unpredictable when it comes to who'll survive and who won't, if any.
Selected intellectual minds, and important folks deemed special for forwarding the human race once a thermonuclear war is to rage across the globe, find themselves fighting for their very lives underground in their fancy governmentally (supposedly)secure bomb shelter well equipped with all the resources they could possibly need as vampire bats, which rest within a cavernous area secret to them, enter and attack when the group is most vulnerable.
There's no explanation given as to when this is supposed to be taking place, but that doesn't matter, we can clearly tell that this is the 1970s, due to the groovy "space-age" decor and the fact that several of the cast members have a sleazy 70s porno look to them, particularly Alex Cord (which sounds like a porno name anyway!).
We can't help but wonder how anybody could be killed by vampire bats, especially when we view the corpses of the victims, which look like a series of bad shaving accidents.
), yet the homicidal spirit homing inside him makes him commit repulsive murders when he sleeps.
Lines like: 'Now this is the time of day when I like to put a plum under a viper', could only have been uttered by Vic.
It is comedy in the true sense, in that the objects or names that Vic mentions (eg when he's looking at what the man with the stick has written on his helmet) are funny in themselves.
I was 10 when I fell in love with Errol Flynn watching this film on TV; more than 30 years later, he's still a hottie [grin].
Some people have a problem with movies like that because when people see a documentary, they expect to be schooled in something or preached to.
Now when I hear a song from the movie, I'm immediately reminded of the scene in which it was heard.
The film is a international collection of how we as humans keep f'ing ourselves over literally and figuratively when it comes to the AIDS epidemic.
The King's treacherous brother, Prince John (Claude Rains), felt his ego belittled when denied the Regency of England during the King's absence.
Ian Hunter's sensitive depiction of the returning King Richard, for instance, brings a tear to the eye when he assures Robin Hood,  `You don't need to search for Richard; he's in good hands, the best in England.'
I agree that the message (as old as Oedipus - those who try to avert disaster can bring it on) is spelled out, but when it's Olympia Dukakis' gentle voice doing it, I don't mind.
He rushes home to find that his father was dead when he drew the blood.
The first story is tragic and with an ironic conclusion when the dweller questions that he sold his blood for US$ 5.00 and he paid US$ 10.00 for the test.
The trials she encounters in her shady business are nothing to the moment of personal anguish when she delivers her baby without assistance in a cornfield.
Robin meets Maid Marian when he and his men ambush a party (prince John tax collectors) with the taxes they have gathered from the people.
John discovers that she was going to tell Robin Hood and will kill her, when he becomes king, in the morning.
Unfortunately, friendships and romantic entanglements will be the main things stretched past the breaking point, when Monica decides to rent the room to Max (Nancho Novo), Yeye's sexy, shady ex-boyfriend who has a secret he won't let get out, and a certain appendage he can't seem to keep...in his pants.
I saw this movie when it was first released, and then again last week on video.
But as we know shadow government agencies and bio-weapons don't mix but they get more than they bargained for when it is revealed that this lowly attorney is an ex-military butt kicker.
Will Martin, (Neil Patrick Harris), is a young man rising up the corporate ladder in New York when he is called home to settle his recently deceased grandfather's estate.
Will's parents were killed in an auto accident when he was a child and he was raised by his grandparents.
Therefore when she gets a chance to go to another school to coach football she grabs it, even though the players are less than refined and practically stink at the game.
But when the film is good, it's good.
Nobody applauded when it was over.
), but sadly overlooked for her impeccable acting abilities (was everyone dozing when she gave breathtaking performances of subtlety and nuance in "Under the Volcano," "Rich and Famous," "High Season," "Le Ceremonie," etc.
), Ms. Bisset's portrayal of a woman trying to put her life in order when she is told she has terminal cancer is one of the finest performances ever committed to celluloid.
It's neither cathartic nor informative, but it does remind me of the thrill I used to get from that once ubiquitous adolescent prank ("See you next Tuesday") when it was pulled off to great effect.
My point is, you just CANNOT make a f*****g point - and expect to be taken seriously - when you are using people that the majority can not identify with.
How on earth am I going to get through to the hardcore religious close minded middle Americans when I'm trying to convince them that it is my RIGHT to say whatever I want by showing them PORN and a bunch of thugs blabber?!?!
The day when someone decided to make a documentary about the word fu*k was inevitable one day if you really think about it, and here it is.
Even so, there are times when I find it offensive.
After all, when the "seven dirty words" were broadcast in New York, out of the millions of people that heard it, only one complained.
For example, I would've liked to have seen more on the F-word in music (where's the MC5 when you need em?
This is quite ironic since these conservative "gentleman"are the one's who've lambasted the liberal left for its unruly and inappropriate support on free speech when referring to the word f*ck.
Sure, the word is said many times throughout the film, but what do you expect when the title is the word itself?
I really enjoyed this movie, when I originally saw it on Sci-Fi's Anime week on Robot Carnival.
Yes, I saw this movie long ago in a time when the Science Fiction channel was one of my favorite channels.
There are a lot of cool moments in it- like when the crew fights with homemade flamethrowers or when someone one of the things attacks (lots of gore).
Firstly when you see a ghost common sense dictates you get the hell out of the house, why would you stay in the house seriously, this movies suffers terribly from clichÃ©, it becomes so much of a problem that it actually becomes quite funny.
2- Why in the hell the news papers talk about a violation of one girl, when the only thing that makes sense is to notice the missing of TWO girls, two girls are missing and the news paper talk about a raped girl?
He did seem like he'd had budget and studio constraints as evidenced by the fact that when I asked him the likely rating of the film in the Q&A after the screening he replied, "y'know... PG-13... gotta keep it marketable".
It feels like another film in a long line of by-the-numbers supernatural thrillers that have come out of Hollywood in the last five years such as Stir of Echoes, Hide and Seek, Secret Window, The Sixth Sense, The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Skeleton Key, The Mothman Prophecies, Bless the Child, The Forgotten, The Others etc, etc (Some of these films are quite good, but you get my point)   I have become very bored of creepy houses (this one was particularly un-imaginative) creepy cornfields, creepy little girls in night dresses, creepy dolls and scarecrows, creepy children's drawings, creepy children's songs, windows blowing open in gusts of wind etc, etc   It is also frustrating when EVERYTHING vaguely frightening is accompanied by a thunderous drum beat, even things like a shot of a child's teddy bear hitting the floor during a flashback!
The ultimate villain-ghost that is finally revealed to have triggered the events is actually just a rather misguided and pathetic character so when they came over all demonic at the end it rang really hollow for me.
i found this look inside the life of one woman in the adult film business interesting.for whatever reason,she allowed a camera crew to to follow her around,not just while working but also during her personal life.she seemed very candid and opened her self up.and allowed herself to be very vulnerable.or at least it appears that way.but it's clear she's also a tragic figure.regardless,the film is an entertaining piece and somewhat revealing.you see someone as a human being,and not just as a sex object.as interesting as the film is,there are no real revelations.and,when you get right down to it,it's still a sad subject.for me,The Girl Next Door is a 7/10
But this carefully constructed image gradually unfolds: Stacy visits the cosmetic surgeon more often than I see my dentist, and she occasionally comes off as incredibly callous, such as when she prostitutes herself to a wealthy fan (not too long after gushing about how frightened she is of losing her boyfriend because he might find someone better), or when she gets very cross at her boyfriend because he can't handle doing a double-teamed scene with her (she actually services the other guy first -- that's showbusiness).
Getting her start when her now ex-husband submitted nude pictures of Stacy to Gallery magazine, she parlayed a follow-up spread in Hustler magazine into a trip to Hollywood in early 1995 to make her mark in adult videos.
I found myself thinking, "poor Stacy...", when in the end, she chose this way of life and can get out whenever she pleases.
My husband said that when it started out, SV "seemed happy and pretty much OK for a while", but from almost the first shot of SV talking about how this is a great job for her because she loves sex and how the porn industry "is the only job where she would get people telling her she's sexy and beautiful", it was obvious that though she is smiling and sounding positive, but really just trying deep down to convince herself that she's happy.
Let's face it-most people (whether they will admit to it or not) would love to be behind the scenes for the filming of a porno movie, just to see what really happens behind the camera (and when the camera is off) and I was no exception.
It sounds cliche (it would to me, reading about it) but when you actually see the movie and watch her talking, looking young enough to get carded with her clean-scrubbed face and baggy casual clothes, you can't help but feel for her.
Her life isn't a complete living hell- you do see her happy at times, talking about what she wants to do when she retires, laughing with her co-stars, looking like she's having fun doing a photo shoot dressed as Marilyn Monroe and even seeming to genuinely enjoy a scene with a female actress interacted on a live porn web-cam.
Her only worry is that when she is gone, Stacey will spend the rest of her life alone.
This felt rather curious, especially when compared with An Evening With Gary Lineker, in which the characters, both male and female, were much better drawn.
The attention to detail in the football seemed much better in that other play too, here it seemed rather desultory - a sequence of blokes cheering when goals went in and looking glum when they didn't.
I saw this movie first about 40 years ago when I was 5 or 6 and all I could think of was how much fun it would be to head off to Sherwood Forest to be a Merry Man -being a girl and living in America put that right out of the realm of possibility !
I knew when I picked up the box that it would be a pretty bad movie.
Years later, after seeing it countless times on video, I saw it on the big screen when it was shown locally, and it was a whole new experience of the film.
Reminding himself of Pepperday's wealth, McGonigle drenches his fury behind a forced grin; "You should see him when nobody's around!"
"Yeah, I'd like to catch, er, meet that li'l fellow when nobody's around..." Finally alone with the lad, Fields does a stunt which has come to symbolize his attitude towards children on film: kicking the baby in the rear end.
This may diminish the big laugh somewhat, but it also demonstrates how Fields's frank humor was ahead of its time, forcing him to truly fight for his best ideas to be permitted once in a while, unlike today when comics can pretty much get away with anything.
The sad thing is that these writers always chose to use the same sub-plot over and over again, involving a stereotypical romantic conflict which, in startling contrast to Fields, appears very dated today; one almost begs for the comedian to turn up again when he is not present.
This is one of my favorite movies, and it hasn't been on the tube for a very long time; one of my favorite comments was the line when Fields describes Cleopatra Pepperday in his inimitable voice as: "All dressed up like a well kept grave!".
I would even wake my children up when they were small singing this song.
If anything, this film is a must-see for two of W.C. Field's scenes: 1) Fields' first meeting with Baby Le Roy (who also appears in It's a Gift), which is easily one of the best comedy scenes in the movies, and 2) Fields' juggling routine, for which he was very famous when he was a vaudevillian, justly so.
Among its many notable scenes are: Fields thinking the military reception waiting at the train station is for his troupe's benefit; the dinner sequence with a rampaging, famished troupe and Fields' hilarious encounter with Baby LeRoy (who throws food at him and drops his watch into a jar of molasses) - Fields manages to get even with the child by kicking him when no one's watching!
Or when she's rehearsing her "line" in the play, "Here comes the prince!"
There is also a fascinating little cultural artifact within the movie -- a production of The Drunkard, a 19th century hit, no doubt popular when William Claude was a mere lad.
Apparently, on one occasion, Fields poured gin into Baby LeRoy's bottle, and when the child began throwing up and falling over, W.C. snorted, "I told you he was no trouper!"
Ever since I first saw it as a kid I've counted it among my favorite W.C. Fields comedies, and when I saw it again recently it was just as funny, warm, and entertaining as ever, maybe all the more so with the passage of time.
Because Fields was in his mid-50s when he made this film he was able to turn the tables, in a sense: instead of reprising his real-life role as a starving young actor he'd graduated by this time to the role of the unscrupulous manager, known here simply as The Great McGonigle.
There is also a racist joke when Carolyn's maid (about the only role open to black actresses in the thirties) remarks that black men are too idle to support themselves and prefer to live off their wives.
Helen Broderick plays the same sarcastic, older but wiser friend that sticks by the young bride when things get tough that she played so many times (Father takes a bride, Smartest Girl in Town, Top Hat) Robert Young is the dashing interloper that really does want to help out, but just makes things worse.
And so poor "Toad" has to travel on an auto-rickshaw, then by the local train (which he was trying to board with all the western civility, brandishing his ticket, but has to come down to the Indian method of jumping randomly into any compartment when he sees that there is no space), and then over the potholed and cow-filled roads of the real India.
"Mr. Toad" has a bout of diarrhoea, is shocked to see a cow walking into his office; learns of the power of Goddess Kali; comes to know the meaning of Shiva Lingam; plays Holi; has his mobile phone stolen and returned and stolen again and returned again; dances to the "Sajan ji ghar aaye" song from 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'; befriends a man from the dhobi ghaT; dresses up in a kurta; eats a ripe mango the Indian way, by peeling it with teeth and sucking on the pulp; does a very typically Indian "jugaad" (which is the Indian art of very economically managing big things with the least resources) of electricity with his friend from the dhobi ghat when his office is flooded and lines are down; and falls in love with the stunning and smart call centre employee, Asha (Ayesha Dharker), who opens his eyes to why the Indians and our English is superior to that of the Americans.
Sadly, the hero discovers that this smart Indian woman who could have been his true love is already engaged to be married, and he is shocked to learn that she was engaged when she was only four.
Just when the Ugly American thing is getting tired and the Colors sequence fails to imbue Josh Hamilton with the transforming chemistry that his character is supposed to feel, Asha steps to the fore and the entire movie turns magical.
That was when she saw "The Adventures of Robin Hood" for the first time in many years in a packed theater in Paris and caught the buzz of the people seeing it around her.
But as Olivia discovered in that French theater and so many of us have been discovering ever since, "Robin Hood" is audaciously clever, a perpetual-motion motion-picture machine when it comes to delivering the goods.
For eg:The incident where Todd transfers the entire office to the terrace when water gushes in.
There are things unbearable and overwhelming about India, but like the protagonist of the movie discovered, it becomes much easier when you lose yourself into the wilderness that India is.
It mildly makes fun of this whole world that corporate culture has given us when it pokes fun at imitation of American accents and at how that becomes a career skill for some.
Of course poverty was seen, but not the more prevalent poverty one sees when first arriving to India.
An excellent movie that shows just what happens when people, who are used to such poverty, now are in a position to have a little money and what happens when they get it and are not used to the consequences.
When I was a teen, there was a moment when I "got it" that the Japanese people and their culture were worthy of respect, even though the Japanese "think weird."
It's funny but becomes a romance as well and has one of its best moments when the two leading actors imitate the stereotype of the other, with impressive results.
Robin Hood (played by Errol Flynn) fights against the villainous Prince John (Claude Rains), who took control of the kingdom as regent when King Richard (Ian Hunter) was captured in Austria during his return from the Holly Lands after Third Crusade's end .
It has clever comedy set-ups with payoffs late in the film, which is hard to do well and I really love when it is.
He's even more perturbed when his boss makes it clear that Todd will be in charge of training the Indian workers to efficiently handle orders while sounding as American as possible; that's important since the firm markets all-American knickknacks, such as miniature flags, hot dog toasters and Wisconsin cheese hats.
Tracy was a master of film acting and never indulged in histrionics; however, when he spoke his words carried weight, and his figure had a presence that commanded attention.
Lee J. Cobb, who took over for Henry Hull as Dave Morris, Father Flanagan's friend, is effective, although there is an initial jolt when he appears, because his is the only major role that was recast from the original film.
Another kid is Darryl Hickman, a young juvenile offender from that same place who sneaks out of the place with Mickey Rooney when Rooney goes to visit one of Nunn's friends.
I think that's when everything went downhill...but it was still enjoyable to watch.
Great show, better than Smallville, the early cartoons and serials but as always, TV executives don't know gold when they see it.
What was so brilliantly ironic was that when Superman, neither character showed anything other than attraction to the other - superb writing.
But the weirdest thing for me is the fact I felt very nostalgic when I put on the DVD with the pilot episode.
I rather rate how much fun I had when I watched it.
But when I saw "Lois and Clark", I realized it wasn't at all just for little boys.
I have not seen all episodes, because I did not watch it when Charmed was on TV.
In the beginning, when you just see Superman and Clark, you might think Superman is arrogant, but when you know him better, he's not at all arrogant.
Clark seems a softy in the beginning, but also when you get to know him better, he's different.
it was way back in 1993 when lois and clark aired the first season i was just 3 years old now i'm 17 i can fully appreciate the brilliance of this show Dean Cain Is By Far The Best Clark Kent/Superman and Teri Hatcher Is The Best Lois Lane/Kent it is not only about the man of steal it's also about the romance between lois and clark.
OK, all well and good, but the HD DVD version I bought this week was restored using a process invented by someone at Warners called Ultra Resolution that digitally re-aligns the three strip Technicolor film to the original state it was in when shot in 1938.
Even my gf, who normally won't watch anything made before about 1980, came in when the film was just starting and ended up watching the whole movie with me and enjoyed it!
This show premiered when I was 11 years old.
The only problem, that eventually saw the show's demise, was when Lois and Clark married as this lead to it becoming too soapy and cavity-inducing although it did serve as a lesson to future TV show producers that you should always pair your leads together in the finale, not half-way through the series.
I got back into watching this show when the DVD's were released.
People have commented on the fact that they shouldn't have gotten Lois and Clark together when they did, but most of the fans were angry at the network for keeping them apart as long as they did.
This was pretty evident when the ratings started dropping during the clone/amnesia/New Krypton arc (which I really liked--there I admit it).
I remember seeing this movie on USA when I was a kid.
SNOWBOARD ACADEMY starring COREY HAIM and ERNIE wasn't great by any means BUT a masterpiece nonetheless when compared to this snooze-fest.
This is my favourite film, so imagine how disturbed I was when I picked this up on DVD and discovered the awesome soundtrack had been changed!
The music doesn't stop when Beth and Steve enter the room.
The scenes are oozing with wonderful white scenery, the women that pass by are consistently scrumptious, the supporting cameo actors are so convincing that its a surprise when Oscars aren't brought into the scene for them, and best of all the skiing scenes are picture perfect, filled with excitement and gloriously filmed manoeuvres that only seasoned pros could make look so good.
Robbing from the rich and giving to the poor until the day comes when good King Richard the Lionhearted comes back from the Crusades and sets things right.
The only notable happening from the undercard was Gregory Helms jumping ship from Raw to Smackdown when he won the WWE Cruiserweight Championship invitational.
The WWE Championship was on the line when Edge defended against John Cena.
It was a great rumble match as usual, a bit better then last year, mostly because i was so shocked Mysterio won, even though there were rumours he would, i didn't believe it, then when he was left with Orton i was sure Orton would win, but it was Rey!
Three of the matches were just awful and the whole 'Rey Mysterio winning' seemed just to be built out of Eddie Guerrero passing away and when WWE uses Eddie's name to make money out of it they are sick.
This is back when b-films were delivered with lots of ballyhoo, and watching these today is still a lot of fun.
It may be little boring to most to own(I personally loved it the first time around, but only re-watch it when I show it to others)but it is definitely worth watching at least once.
For an idea of what it was like during the transition, you can reference Schwarzenegger's Last Action Hero (when it goes "real") as a representation of the change.
Errol Flynn,by far gives the most credible performance of the Robin Hood character.He oozes charm and wit,here.This film is a great trip back to a special time in movie making when we didn't need extreme sex and violence to entertain us.Now that I have seen it,this movie definitely goes on my video shelf.If you have children,or if you love to feel like one,as I do,I highly suggest you give this a look.Great film.
(God she's stunning), The Hammer when he was still at the top of his game as 'Boss N*gger', campy gay bike riders, and a ton of nudity, gore and violence are just a few of the delightfully high points.
What happens when they connect is what carries the minimalist plot, such as it is.
The camera adores her luminous face, even when made to look decidedly unglamorous, as in 'Clare' and 'Bridge.'
The co-director Michael Curtiz is responsible for so many of the films one thinks about when the 'golden age of the studios' is mentioned Â the list is amazing with Casablanca and Yankee Doodle Dandy among them.
I have been a Robert Duvall fan for many years now so when this movie showed up on my DVR I naturally watched it.
The scene in the restaurant when Duvall asks if he was younger could he have a chance with her was priceless.
When he directs himself; i.e., when he's receiving no direction at all, he is just awful.
As played by Duvall, John J. is constantly running off at the mouth; he can't shut up for five minutes even when he's alone.
Diane said that the shots of the cafe's and the Tango clubs and the music and the dancing are what she saw in BA when she visited last year.
The substance of that job comes as a shock when reality kicks in towards the end but in the totality of the movie it plays such a small part.
I first saw the film when I was a small boy and I have deliberately avoided buying the DVD on the basis that over-familiarity could breed contempt.
not to mention, it is one of those films where you just wish the protagonist is going to die and the end and are disappointed when he doesn't.
This is when you realize that it's a tango movie .
To me, the interesting thing about Duvall's character is that he is a hit-man who must disguise all of himself to others ( he even leads his benefactors to believe that he would carry out the hit at a specific time when in truth, he always has his own cautious agenda -- and he is correct not to trust anyone ).
The film also reminds me a bit of Apochalypse Now in that you just sort of have to watch it -- many times, perhaps -- and realize at the end you're just about as confused as you were when you first saw it, so if you're like me, you accept that, live with it, and are happy to hear any new interpretations that might come along.
Baker hardly gets any screen time, and when she does its often sans dialogue, but Pedraza steals each scene regardless: her acting is so seamless and authentic that any time she ISN'T on-screen we spend waiting for her to return.
If there's one quibble I have with the film, its when Duvall tries (in retrospect) to make his relationship with Pedraza seem like more than it really was: they aren't together long enough to make the attempted love story believable, but this is entirely forgivable.
My attention, however, accelerated when newcomer Luciana Pedraza entered the picture.
For several months we were locked into a cold, dark, little room, for long periods of time" and that Trey was actually abducted when he was a small child.
The first thing you'll notice when you first see the Episode is the Animation I mean the Animation isn't what you call Bad but it wasn't the best.
However this episode had many moments that made me laugh like in scenes where we see Cartman telling his friends over and over that there's nothing wrong with him when his friends obviously know that there is because there's a Big Ass Satellite coming out of his Ass, or the famous Kick the Baby scene where Kyle constantly kicks his little brother Ike like a Football.
This is the very first episode of South Park entitled "Cartman Gets An Anal Probe".It has the worst animation in the series because it was made using construction paper...but we never looked at the animation in this show anyway.Nowadays, South Park has plenty of its humor stemming from current events and politics.I like this, I like all episodes of South Park, but its pretty interesting to go back to a time when it was just funny fart jokes with a simplistic plot.In this episode, Cartman recalls a dream he had where he was dragged on a ship and got an anal probe from aliens.However it was not really a dream and the aliens have come to south park.Cartman just thinks the other boys are trying to scare him though.The visitors kidnap Kyle's brother Ike and now they must go find him.With the help of the school cafeteria chef(played by Issac Hayes R.I.P), they get out of school and try to get Kyle's brother back.Meanwhile, officer barbrady has been investigating why the cows are being mutilated.This episode was originally 26min long.You can find this extended version of the episode on the internet.It makes a few changes, such as Cartman having a father and a sister and an introduction to Nurse Gollum(without the fetus on her head).Overall, its the not the best episode but it is pretty funny and good.
It just goes to show when someone says there not much you can buy with a dollar, I will give them an Armed Response.
Brent was one of the most handsome and sexy actors in these actioners and he could act when given half a chance.
I love this show because it creates a lot of drama when people can get eliminated and because it's cool to see all these different places they get to go to.
One of the most moving moments of the show was when they had one of the contestants was a female dwarf but despite her physical limits, she managed to get far near the end of the race.
For example when one of those black sisters called Luke "bitch" in the last season.
But otherwise it's brilliant show and I think everybody find it exciting when one bothers to watch it.
It just feels so short when the movie ended.
Given all these historical facts, it is grotesque to see today all the trouble the Russian state goes to in order to construct itself the image of an emerging democracy, when its population is just as terrorized and pauperized as it was 50 years ago.
somehow i still sense "hollywood things" in it, but i think it's understandable, considering we're living in a time when hollywood rules the film industry of the world.
But the famous Korngold score, with its full orchestral depth and rousing fanfares, is as familiar today as it was seventy years ago, when it won its Academy Award.
From the faultless casting through unforgettable pageantry and timeless romance to the final spectacular duel, when Robin and Gisbourne meet "once too often", this picture richly deserves its reputation as *the* Robin Hood on film - from which on present showing it is unlikely ever to be dethroned.
From the beginning, when they get down from the ship and the music and military marches don't sound as they should, but muffled and empty, you could see reality was going to take its toll on the couple's dreams.
But then, when I was watching the movie, all events seemed so realistic.
Here you have a community of individuals that are captured by the thought of a longer life, freedom, and food, only when they arrive (like animals in zoo); they are shocked by the realism that it is not a vacation.
When they were together you wanted them to be, and when they were apart, you dreamt of them being back together.
While I did see some evolution when they were in Russia, it was later that I needed the follow-up.
Alexei, Marie, and Serioia go from what must have been a comfortable, bourgeois life in France to a nightmare when they end up, thanks to Alexei's being a physician, in Kiev.
"Est Ouest", directed by Regis Wargnier, shows in vivid detail what Alexei and Marie, his wife, have to endure when they are taken to Kiev, where he is assigned.
Little did Alexei and Marie knew about the dismal housing problems of those years when the family is given a large room in an apartment that is being shared by five families!
Alexei ends up having an affair with Olga, another flat mate, and Marie falls in love for the poor Sacha, a young man who is left alone in the world when his grandmother dies.
The film has an ironic end when Marie, helped by Gabrielle, a French actress, who is sympathetic to her fellow countryman.
Marie realizes at the end of Alexei's tremendous sacrifice and ultimate punishment when she and her son are able to escape the communist hell that has imprisoned them.
My father was a french communist (the heart on the left and the wallet on the right) and he actually contempleted emigrating to the motherland of socialism when I was a kid, thank God, his wallet was heavier than his heart... Go to your video store and rent it, you won't regret it !
"East/West" ventures into a time (post WWII) when the Iron Curtain shrouded Stalin's Soviet Union and a curtain of suspicion and distrust shrouded every soviet life.
The first thing they see when they leave their ship in Odessa is a father separated from his son, the son executed on the spot.
His scenes, when they are not sleight-of-hand magic, are essentially tableaux, punctuated by acrobats.
It's basically the same reason that they were such a hit when they jointly played the character on TV.
What has happened to this country, when the appreciation of child beauty is simply written off as "child porn"?
My favourite part of the movie (besides the credits indicating to me it was over) was when Simple Plan was in it.
Neither one has a boy friend when the film starts but both end up with a boy friend when the film ends.
;-) It all started when I was on a bus to NYC, they ran Mary Kate & Ashley's School Dance on the TVs.
;-) It all started when I was on a bus to NYC, they ran Mary Kate & Ashley's School Dance on the TVs.
I saw this on a date back when this first came out.
The first time they made it when they called it Ferris Bueller's Day Off http://www.imdb.com/Title?0091042  Clueless Parents = Dr. Drew  Eugene Levy = Me.
Despite a traumatic experience in my teenage years, when I was repeatedly forced to watch "It Takes Two" (an Olsen twins version of "The Parent Trap") by some kids I frequently babysat, I gave this one a chance.
And when the girls get lost in Harlem they're just gonna get their hair cut.
I actually used to like the Olsen twins when I was younger and I have just outgrown them.
This doesn't always work out well in movies but there are exceptions and when there are exceptions, they are always brilliant ones.
Back when they were students, they were best friends, but after several years, the relation between these men went down hill.
This delivers some great scenes, like the one in which Maarten is trying to tell Joep that he had sex with his 18 year old daughter, when they were preparing Maarten's latest play.
It's interesting in that when she married Bing Crosby, she was a bigger star than he was, and by 1935, he was a superstar, and her career was over.
Unfortunately, the movie suffers when it takes a melodramatic turn in the last 10 minutes but the ending is happy (it's a comedy after all!)
Please try to find this film when it goes into distribution.
When I review these very early films, I cut some of them a lot of slack because of when they were made.
Really modern looking films with plots, decent acting and good camera-work were still just a couple years off when this film was made.
So, when this film features a prankster nailing two ladies' dresses to a fence, it is an absolute laugh riot FOR THAT TIME PERIOD.
Its Pretty Sad When That Scared Medic Dies After He Gets Mad When His friend dies and at the beginning when all those innocent NK Soldiers die especially that wounded soldier.
This symbolic "shedding" of their former identities was demonstrated quite poignantly when each of them adopted the traditional garments of the town...the fact that each of them voluntarily assumed such physical transformations evinced a willing preference and readiness for unity.
World cinema is far popular now than when i first got into it and i'm not to sure thats such a good thing because there was a time where only the best titles made there way to this country, a time where renting a foreign film guaranteed quality but that changed with the sudden American studio interest.
Dongmakgol is an amazingly verdant,pristine village where a US navy pilot Neil Smith(Steve Taschler) crash-lands when his plane gets caught in a surreal butterfly storm.The village which is totally incognizant of the Korean conflict warmly welcomes the foreigner.
but when Smith answers him "How do you think I am?
The first thing that occurred to me when I was watching Welcome to Dongmakgol was that I was watching a Hayao Miyazaki film.
for example), and i must say i loved this one, when we see why the young communist soldier had a flower too, and who gave him it.
No special happy ending for the village or whatever, just a moment when all of them where together, 6 as the 6 butterflies that we saw flying away from the snow a few moments before.
These four men scale a steep mountain and their number is reduced to three when the fourth plummets to his death.
I didn't care who was wearing which uniform, nor did I care who the "bad guys" were, nor did I even flinch when I, a red-blooded American, found myself occasionally hoping for an American soldier to be shot (a truly bizarre experience).
It will leave you awed when you leave the theater.
What do you get when you combine an Aussie celeb and her hubby, a video camera, some Bondi regulars, and sexism and sleaze galore?
When I first saw "Tale of a Dog" back in the 70's on television, I had no idea this was the very last "Our Gang" comedy made until I read about it in Leonard Maltin and Richard Bann's "Little Rascals" book when it was first published in 1977.
There was a possible reference to this fact when, in the opening scene, Big Shot tells Smallpox while sniveling, "There comes a time when even the best of friends must part."
As for the short itself, it was rather funny, especially the scenes where the other kids run from Buckwheat and Big Shot while a radio announcer's voice warns listeners of the "epidemic," and when the kids hog the phone booth in a drug store while other people wanting to use the phone line up behind them (they hang up a sign that says "Line is bizzy").
His mother is truly a nice person, but too nice when Tanguy is around.
You can see when he tries to live on his own that he does not even make an effort, and immediately pre-judges that he could not possibly make it on his own.
Since I didn't enjoy "La vie est un long fleuve tranquille", I didn't expect too much from "Tanguy" when I went to the cinema.
Now on to the main star JUDE LAW, When OH when is he going to get his Oscar..
I hate it when aircraft movies feed more inaccurate information to an audience which may be fearful and unknowledgeable of aviation.
The story was also unrealistic when I discussed it with friends of mine who are in the medical transportation field.
As someone with considerable affection for Australia, I was cringing under the seat when it came to the section titled, 'Confrontation'.
They like to play big brother (in a positive way), but I could not believe that Will would refuse to help Amira's son when she is literally on her knees begging him!
Minghella played it in this artificial way so as to set up the climactic scene when Will and Liv arrive together at the hearing.
In real life Will could not say no when Amira is begging him because (1) he does want to help the boy, (2) she still has the power to embarrass Will and his wife even though she has given him the incriminating photo negatives, (3) it is totally out of character for him to suddenly care so much about the affair coming out, and (4) he immediately confesses it to his wife anyway.
In the scene when Will returns to his wife after the stakeout smelling of the prostitute's perfume, we have Liv smelling it, and then when he opts for a shower, she pulls him close for immediate sex.
I am sorry to be so critical but this could have been an outstanding movie, and I get irritated when directors go to print so quickly.
However when they have to pick up and move, it's extremely difficult to find any kind of job so she has to resort to being a tailor working out of her own home.
This element is also displayed with Erika, who has to resort to being a cleaning lady and is automatically accused when the break-ins first start.
I really found this movie touching, probably since being at that stage in life when one can easily understand and identify with these situations.
I remember when Law was an exciting new actor, but there was that year that I think we all got sick of him when he appeared in like 20 movies.
In Minghella's sphere every human being is welcome and lovable,he's not accusing or justifying the people, but the circumstances.It is a film that tells the story of a lot of people of our times when political and social insecurities have broken the borders between countries and made many people immigrants.
By this I mean that they not only know how to show us what their souls contain, but they have souls worth visiting when (temporarily) so shaped.
the imaginary world in which the luvvies of the film scene live in their bubble and try to remember what real people were when they once knew them.
It's sad in a way to realize this was Mr. Minghella's last work when he had so much to give us.
Penn gave a delicate yet fierce performance particularly at the end, when she lashes out at Will for all the preceding predicaments that he had caused.
Though this film has the intentions of establishing a dramatically intense atmosphere, the tension breaks with a touch of crude humour when the prostitute appears.
There are two scenes which exemplify Binoche as the best actress in the business; when she decides to take pictures of her sleeping lover against his knowledge, she tries to make it look like she enjoys it but immediately reviles with disgust and disgrace, and when she descends to desperate begging from her lover for his help.
The film has a number of subplots and social commentaries (and a few funny moments: look out for the scene in which one character states "Latte's have been drunk" you'l understand when you see it) but I will not dwell on them as they are secondary to the excellent performances of its cast.
Don't ask me to explain, I may ruin the whole thought just by trying an intellectual explanation when in fact it only makes sense viscerally.
He shouts to him, and when the kid runs away, Will pursues him.
Goat takes up with a sultry animal-wrangler with an annoying European accent; he dumps her when he thinks that the ex-girlfriend's kid is his, but, after the old black man dies, a tape is played at the funeral that gets Goat and the wrangler back together.
The whole story was great, and I was even more astonished when I found out the low budget.
This is one of those flicks that are worth catching on cable if it happens to be on when you have nothing else to do.
This film is about an American singer named Bobby Denver, who is known as the "Crying Crooner" (a la Johnnie Ray), who stays with a stockbroker's family by mistake when he comes to England.
Of these only "Cry" hit's the mark being exactly the type of song Johnny Ray would've sung and this provides the sole amusing scene in the film when a slightly drunk Buchanan decides to have a crack.
By the last 5 minutes I was longing to fast forward this particular turkey when out of the blue the film gave us a few minutes of vintage Jack, in a brief song and dance number after all the plot points were been resolved.
It's sad when a movie fails to entertain even an airplane audience.
At a time in my life when everything seems to be going wrong, I have caught myself being detached from my children and spending way too much time stressing over life and responsibilities.
Best part has to be when Murphy goes through his stock pick notes that have been doodled on my his daughter - "this stock is gonna drop its pants because they have a poopy diaper...........".
The movie does not aim to be something special just when the end credits role it makes you feel good.
There are some real gem scenes in the movie, hilarious when eddie murphy and his daughter have to say grace but i wont spoil it.
On the whole this was just a fun movie to watch and enjoy and makes you realise how great it is to have children in your life just when you are wondering why you had children !!
I was actually at a bachelor party in Vegas when we decided to split up for a few hours and I rushed straight over to the Hilton.
But that was also when Star Trek was in its prime, so it really brought be back.
I was expecting a halfway decent shuttlecraft ride and was BLOW AWAY when I realized I was the Enterprise transporter room.
Dakota Fanning wasn't this good when she was her age.
Yet, when he gets homes, Eddie walks around the apartment wondering where everyone is.
But that excitement deflated faster than the Hindenburg when I realized 'Hellbent' was no better than the average flick that arrives direct to the shelves of Blockbuster with alarming frequency.
See it when it comes to your town!
I felt just like the guy at the beginning of the movie who was getting a you-know-what, when the film was just about to reach climax, it cut its own head off!!
Filmed on location during West Hollywood's annual gay Halloween parade, this gives the film a freaky feeling of even though you are surrounded by lots of people, you are still very much alone when a crazed psychopath is on the loose!!
There are some wonderful moments in the film, like when Eddie first sees Jake, and has trouble hitting on him because he's nervous, or when Joey gets the phone number of the guy he's interested in.
And Bryan Kirkwood's surly-boy still manages to draw you in, even when he's more than a little threatening.
And it seems that gay characters (even when created by gay men) can only be X-takin', circuit-party-frequentin', bathroom-stall-sex-havin' pretty boys.
I'm so glad I saw it when I did - it was a super finale to the film festival.
I hope to see Hellbent again soon when it's released on a national scale.
It was a late night and I was scanning through the channels when I stopped on Sci/Fi.
The second but the most important thing which made me laugh but in two halves was the effects: its the 21st century and it made me feel sick to watch a computer generated crocodile super-imposed onto the screen so badly when movies in the 30's had better effects than this trash!
The part that truly had me crying my eyes out was when she/Jill was waiting for Dick to give her that call,but it never came.
And when the small town sheriff shows us all that he is an expert with an MGL Grenade Launcher, well, let's just say I called up my local movie store and reserved ten copies.
but when i found out there was going to be a LAKE PLACID 2, i was so excited.
i saw it when it premiered in April.
the funniest/dumbest scene was that part when that girl says to the guy "stop touching my feet" and it turns out to be the 45 foot croc.
A sheriff(John Schneider, really stuck with some corner one liners when he blasts the monsters)must contend with several large crocodiles which are eating locals.
Surely when they were reading their part they had to have went at some point "man, there's no way in the world someone would act this way at this point."
Later in the woods when the chips are down and the gators attack, lo and behold out comes the 'super gun'....where'd that come from?
He didn't have it when he returned to the hunt!
One of the craziest scenes is when the hot-headed jerk is mouthing off to his two companions how he would never ever believe there's a monster croc.
The sheriff is a complete idiot who is supposed to be the protagonist who seems to be so stupid that he acts casual even when he sees a giant crocodile eat a live man.
It is just surprising for me to see how unaffected a bunch of morons are when facing a giant reptile and how casual they act even when someone was just eaten.
There are two examples of this: One is when Paris Hilton dies.
The second example is when the sheriff's son, the girl he likes, and the girl's 'boyfriend' find a crocodile's nest and (of course) the retarded boyfriend starts crushing eggs, making a bad joke like "I know what kind of egg this is.
Then, the mom croc comes back and gives that "Oh no you didn't" impression and comes up behind the boyfriend, snarling and breathing loudly and even when the girl says "There's a giant crocodile behind you!
He dies, thank God, and then, (even though when she said "There's a giant crocodile behind you!
That's when I turned off my TV and got onto my computer to warn you all about this horrible movie.
There are several times when you can see parts of the crocodiles magically pass through things.
But when Melba finds her, she finds out Dottie's dreams only lasted temporarily.
Well she didn't know that when she went to the diner, that three young guys Trent, Joel, and Brad were her three kings, who were on there way to Las Vegas to win money so they could pay rent.
TRUST ME, you'll end up wanting your boyfriend to see it because it clearly depicts what CAN happen when a boy doesn't know when to say "enough is enough" and take, albeit giant for some, that step into becoming a responsible man.
Not sure what I expected when I started watching this movie.
anyway I thought Dracula was known as a vampire but when i saw this movie it changed i don't know if this is the absolute true story but it was still a very good movie.
I was therefore greatly disappointed when both Vlad and one of his closest servants wore skin pants, almost resembling the rock-and-roll days of the 80s.
Vlad's conflict with the Orthodox priests is not documented, nor is it documented that he was to be killed by a priest when he was an infant.
Then we go back to when he and his brother Radu were children; they were captured by their father's enemy, the Sultan, to be held prisoner until their father, Prince of Romania, agrees to the tribute the Sultan demands.
At one point, a group of Romanian emmisaries who have come to make a final demand for tribute from his country - and are led by his brother, Radu, who has stayed with and decided to side with the Turks - refuse to remove their turbans when asked to do so.
However, he is released when the King uncovers the plot.
And from now on, when he battles, it will be on behalf of the Catholic Church.
His reputation as a mad executioner would be well justified by today's standards, although he was just a babe when compared to other rulers of his time (his own cousin, Stephen the Great, ruler of Moldavia, "the Athlete of Christ" as he had been named by the Pope for having repeatedly beaten the crap out of the Turks, had reportedly killed many more people through impalement than Vlad but because he had always been politically correct, he never went down into history as a deranged butcher).
That is why, for the Romanians, he's still, up to this day, considered a national hero of special importance, unlike any other, because his name is called upon in times of great oppression, when corruption and plundering of the national economy by the oligarchic political class bring the common, ordinary citizens on their knees.
It's quite muted in these aspects, however it brings about a refreshing realism to the story, a great departure from the days when action has to be stylized (flying through the air shooting two guns anyone?)
You must watch this when it makes it to our shores in Singapore, tentatively scheduled for mid April.
The casting was good, everyone played their character well (mostly), except I sort of agree with the other reviewer when they said that you really don't 'dislike' the father, even though his acts can sometimes be inappropriate.
But if you read those names and expect a big budget, action-packed, thriller your out of luck, it was made back in 1977 when they were starving artists.
The father and mother still pay homage to the 50's and cling to to the ideal of raising a home when it is obvious the kids are already grown and moving on.
I know that I'm not alone and not doing so bad, when I see other people trying to figure out life.
Perhaps the animals would have looked fake in Technicolor, but they are quite impressive in black and white, especially the predatory allosauruses (although they are rather cute in close up when they fastidiously lick their digits after a particularly juicy chunk of flesh or snarl like Elvis Presley.)
Stone had a way of coming across as natural, which thing seems a refreshing oddity in older movies like this when "over the top" was thought to be a requirement.
Wallace Beery is a Challenger for the ages, seeming to have strutted directly from Doyle's novels - there's no need for sound when the performances are this gigantic.
He goes completely berserk while making a presentation at the university when Edward Malone (Lloyd Hughes) reveals his identity as a newspaper reporter.
Later he engages Malone in fisticuffs when the young man appears at his home to inquire about joining the expedition.
There's a scene when a brontosaurus prepares to do battle with an allosaur, and curls it's upper lip in a manner that would do Elvis Presley proud.
Later, when another bronto falls off a cliff into a mud pool, Professor Challenger has the bright idea of capturing it and bringing it back to London.
His earlier Silent Movie Shorts when he first conceived the idea were corky & primitive but still entertaining today.
The movie is a Masterpiece of early Special Effects I especially like when the Brotosaurus escapes the cage & breaks loose terrorizing the streets of London that is very memorable.
But when it does work it's classic dinosaur excitement, even when going past 80 years time.
It's crude and not without some jagged timing due to the nature of how silent film (when not properly restored like the DVD I watched), yet there's never a dull moment once the action starts rolling around; only Wallace Beery can add to the fun as his reaction shots as 'Challenger' are as classic as the dinos themselves.
This was the first movie I ever taped when I got my first VCR back in the 1980's.
Cleverly adapted by Broadway playwright Marion Fairfax (who also adapted in 1922 another of Conan Doyle's works, "Sherlock Holmes"), the film is an excellent mix of action and adventure that even when it's not entirely faithful to the novel, keeps the spirit of wonder and fascination with the unknown.
Unlike King Kong, which wisely built up suspense and tension when introducing the prehistoric denizens of Skull Island, the dinosaurs in Lost World appear abruptly and without context.
This is overall a truly emotional and violent roller-coaster of what happens when friends grow and and the repercussions of what that means, be it good or bad.
Lookout for Ed Harris's reaction at the funeral when he learns the truth about Terry.
One of the best scenes you have to see, is when Ed Harris meets with his boss about killing his brother(Oldman).
The tension is so strong when he tells his gang to come and back him up if he don't call by 2:oo o'clock.
I found the nighttime and early morning scenes when terry is first back in the kitchen absolutely intoxicationg.
The title of the movie explains it for anyone who doesn't understand the movie and if you still need clarification on what a state of grace is Penn's character explains it in detail in the movie when visiting Robin Wright Penn's characters apartment.
There are moments in the film that are very disquieting, as when Ed Harris, who normally distances himself from his rackets, finds that he has to himself kill someone he loves.
At the outset, when it seems concerned only with the behavior of its characters, it's original and challenging.
The only thing he did that had any real bearing on the story was when he gave Mike the tuning fork.
Since when did Reggie become Arnold Schwarzenegger?
But then when the Tall Man returns to the room through the portal, he can see Mike?
The storyline is not the best but it does not have to be when you are watching people like Gary Oldman act his socks off.
Only problem is, when he left, he went to Boston to become a cop, and now he's undercover and infiltrating his old friends.
Things take a turn, however, when Frankie's psychotic methods and attempts to align with a powerful Italian syndicate reveal him to be worse than Terry imagined, and he takes matters into his own hands.
Torturror's role is small so fans, don't get too excited when you see his name.
The entire movie is set upon a collision course between Terry and Frank, and when they finally collide, director Phil Joanou films it almost like a dream sequence.
Facing our fears is one thing, but the true measure of a person's character is how we perform when that fear stares into us, face to face.
Watch this film for the terrific performances of all the lead actors, for the fantastic music, the frenetic action, and the moving drama, but watch it also to ask yourself, what are your demons, when will you finally face them and what will happen when you do?
I'll admit it took me a while to realize it, but when I found myself laughing at, especially, Barrymore's "shoot him" and other extreme comments, I finally caught on.
So when I tuned into it one night on Turner Classics, at first I wasn't too sure what to think.
you know something is wrong when you get done watching a movie, and you find yourself saying, "oh that malkovich guy did a really good job."
I think it's a wonderful movie and it's been unjustly underestimated:it's oneiric,sentimental,poetic and the dramatic plot is dealt with a sense of humour.There are various issues like male bonding,homosexuality,friendship and I think every role is proper for the actor who plays it:my favourite actor JOHN MALKOVICH(GREAT)is a homosexual with some existential problems and he falls in love with Marty(Michael Zelniker)and they get engaged at the end of the film;Dennis(Kevin Bacon)has in vain tried to get successful in Hollywood as a musician,Al(Joe Mantegna)grows up thanks of Jamie Lee Curtis,Vinny(Tony Spiridakis)dreams to become an actor and Ray(Ken Olin)a painter.Even if the dreams of some of these guys don't come through,their strong and profound tie is the reason to continue to hope in the future.I also think the title is the only very funny thing of the movie(in Italian language it's "Dreaming Manhattan")but the film succeeds to alternate melancholy and thoughtless scenes:Mantegna climbs up the bridge which links Astoria to Manhattan,Ken Olin listens to his message "I love you guys" while he's thinking about his life,Kevin Bacon and Michael Zelniker play "ordinary people song" while Zelniker and Malkovich look at each other,Malkovich jilts Terry Kinney,who had fallen in love with him,because he doesn't like the way he talks about his friends(when Kinney asked him if those guys were his type,he replied "that I don't know but they are the best I could do"),Tony Spiridakis howls with a healer without a reason,Tom Waits reads his odd poem at Jack's,Jamie Lee Curtis takes Mantegna's gun and learns him to throw all away,Chloe Webb tells Madame Rose,a palmist, she's surrounded by idiots,the five boys shout out Arnold's name while they're having a bath under Hellgate during the night because he was the only guy,apart from Mantegna,who climbed up that bridge and they don't see Linda Fiorentino stealing their clothes out of spite,because her husband Mantegna spent all his time with his friends(he also kisses John Malkovich at the disco)...well,these guys are amazing!They are either crazy or gay,either sad or happy,sometimes they make you cry,sometimes they make you amuse.Personally I was a depressed sixteen year old girl when I saw this movie for the first time on a night during last summer and it made me dream:this movie is everything for me,it lets me to take refuge in another world and it makes me isolate from my reality,whom I hate as much as I can, but fortunately I'm not here,I'm under Hellgate Bridge to dream with other Queens.I thank Tony Spiridakis,who wrote the story,and all the actors very much for this wonderful movie!!
I must've seen it 20 times by now, and I still can't pass it up when it appears on some random cable station at 1 in the morning!
Perhaps the best scene is when Eliot tells a "pesky" homosexual to "bug off", because he just doesn't like him.
I never really had any true friends when I was growing up (I was weird, okay), but I know that the best friends are the ones who stay around.
New York, Long Island target audience) when it really has a multitude of universal levels to it.
There are also a few twists and turns that, while well signposted, impress once again by showing how fearless Coscarelli really is when he has such faith in his own material.
Writer, director Tod Browning would return to the circus setting with even greater critical success when he would make Freaks (it was a box office disaster) in 1932 but Unknown holds its own with the classic in many ways.
Crawford is less likable than Loretta Young in LAUGH, CLOWN, LAUGH- in fact, I found her rather unattractive and forgettable when compared to Young's sweet charm.
In love with the circus owner's daughter, Alonzo kills the circus owner when he discovers he really does have arms.
Just like in "Freaks" Tod Browning has managed to create sympathetic characters, even when they are doing some not so nice deeds.
I don't want to give away the ending, but if you are familiar with Chaney's other characters, you know how he usually finds himself when The End appears on-screen.
His gesture and movement remains unmistakable, even when concealed by the costumes and makeup of his many characters.
Alonzo will gradually become more sinister during the film and finally will rise up in arms when he fails to succeed with his evil intentions.
Just when you think that this person can sink no lower...he does.
Malabar, the Mighty(Norman Kerry), a Strongman who works for Antonio Zanzi's circus wishes to forge a relationship with Nanon, but when he attempts to embrace her, the phobia she has pushes her away from him.
Zanzi is Nanon's father and his disgust towards Alonzo heightens when the Armless one attempts to woo her.
This two-thumbed hand leaves quite an indelible mark on others, especially when Alonzo murders Zanzi.
He seethes with anger when the hunky Malabar makes a pass at Nanon.
Overall, different and slightly depressing - is the moral we men are all so desperate when infatuated with a woman?
Chaney is just incredible--the expression on his face when he tries to hide his anger and sadness at Kerry is truly extraordinary.
The only version I've seen is on TCM and it IS short (less than an hour), but it's the exact same one I saw back in the late 1980s when revival theatres were showing it.
Zanzi doesn't trust Alonzo and when he sees his daughter alone with him again, his anger builds because he feels he is putting "ideas" in his daughter's head.
But when he returns to see Nano, she tells him that she overcame her fear of having a man put her arms around her and will marry Malabar.
The scene in this film when he realizes that he's cut off his arms for nothing is one of the most emotional in all of silent film (perhaps all of film), and it consists mostly of a closeup of his face as the horrible irony registers.
Mirroring that is a scene when he distractedly lights a cigarette with his feet, an intricate process that was aided by Peter Dismuki, a real armless man who served as a stunt double for many of Chaney's actions.
The shots are filmed through a heavy gauze that gives the entire composition the look of an oil painting with visible brushwork; it adds a softness and an intimacy that's similar to the effect later directors desired when they used soft-focus closeups of smiling women's faces, but there's nothing silly about its use here.
His ability to lose the girl, when the movie hero would usually win her, was remarkably heartbreaking.
The other was that he had a creepy presence on screen Â even when he played the good guy.
A circus performer ventures into THE UNKNOWN regions of fate when he allows love to be twisted by hatred.
All anyone has to do is to watch his expression when he has come back, sans arms, and Nanon tells him she is in love with Malabar.
We often see Chaney's body but Peter Dismuki's feet, such as when Alonzo is playing guitar, smoking, drinking, and so on.
Occasionally, Dismuki just stood in for Chaney, usually when Alonzo has his back to the camera, but at least in one wider shot, we can see Dismuki's face.
Some of the acting was alright, especially Grace, the lead, the priest, Jenn Copping and Ben Ratner, who is quite a cameleon when it comes to acting (see: Dirty).
I saw 'See Grace Fly' when it opened in the theaters in Vancouver.
It stands out to me as one of Paul's best from the movie, let's just say the actor can cry very convincingly and put a lump in your throat and when it comes to this scene, his face and eyes portray Dom's torment as much, if not more then the dialogue.
Already in the beginning of the film, when the all-powerful Czar Nicholas I is talking to Princess Maria about her mission, it's all too clear that he's under her spell and Princess Maria charmingly takes advantage of his infatuation for her own means (after this scene I was hooked).
From his early scenes of controlled rage to the final denouement when he takes revenge against his enemies, this is a true tour de force for this skillful and under utilized actor.
Especially effective is the scene with his enemy, Vince, when Nick's "playful" slaps suddenly turn deadly.
I never felt really bad for the actors when something bad happened to them... the soundtrack sounds like a B-Movie with Dolf Lundgreen.
Yes, it's hard to date when you reach 39, or 45, or 60.
All the pretty boys in this film will reach a time when they are all becoming Josh.
The look in Josh's eyes when he watches the guy in front of him tear open those 3 packets for his coffee in the train station restaurant is so romantic.
That is for you to find out when you see the film.
Do we really think he would have gotten more dates when he was 20-something?
"Regular gay guy" (to quote the DVD box) Josh has a hissey fit when he catches his lover of 10 years receiving oral sex from someone he has... well, we never find out just how much of a low life the lover may or may not be.
She lights up the scene when she is in the room, and there just isn't enough of her to make a completely believable character.
But when on very rare occasions, I get a chance to watch a movie and to my luck, it turns out to be a master piece.
He goes back to his Tamas days, when Om Puri carried his mother on a push cart ('thela').
He no longer raves and rants like he used to (it was the need of the hour when he did that).
Just when we thought that "Dev" is a film about The Good defying The Evil, we are wrong.
The Anti-Social activists from the minority community, when get nabbed down by the Police, results a provocation by the leaders to protest the Police simultaneously provoking the formation of more Anti-social elements.
The Final dialog is splendid when he says the Moral of Story : "A Soldier's duty is to fight, fight till the last drop of blood, irrespective of whether the war shall be won or not"
I wasn't kidding when I compared this to the works of Ingmar Bergman.
Like Island of Terror, much of the picture is during daytime, though there are some effective night scenes (when not mistakenly photographed during day).
A small British isle inexplicably has temps soar into the 90's, in the dead of winter when the temp should be around 30.
There are a few clichÃ©s, but they were probably fresher plot devices in the '60's when this was made.
I consider Phantasm IV to be a little better than the disappointing (but still good) third entry of the series, but my issue with this one is that even though you are entertained throughout and your eyes will probably be glued to the screen, nothing really happens when you think about it.
Initially seeming like a predatory vamp, her strength seems to be drained after Callum eventually comes clean to his wife about their affair and she assumes a far less threatening role, her vengeance becoming further distilled through interactions that could never have been predicted when she originally formatted what could have been either a revenge scenario or a straightforward attempt to usurp Frankie.
I taped Night Of The Big Heat when BBC1 screened it during the early hours a few years ago.
Angela keeps prancing about in a two piece bathing suit and putting the moves on Jeff who only replies with kissing when Frankie is not looking.
If you notice in certain scenes when the actors are outside you can actually see their breath!
And how about Patrick Allen's response when his wife asks him about Angela.
It was showing at the CMJ convention in New York back when it first came out, and that was quite possibly the films only stint in theaters.
The acting is poor, the story is far worse, and we walked out when we'd reached our breaking point.
It is even sadder when the victim is a child.
alert:   One high point was is 9th birthday when Ben was surrounded by friends and family who loved him  The saddest part ,in which I will never forget, was when Ben was in his mother's lap and his body violently jolted forward struggling to maintain life at the precise moment his heart stopped beating.
I saw this movie back in high school at age 16 and there was not a dry eye in the classroom at the end of the movie when Ben died of AIDS complications, and if I remember correctly, it was a true story.
The most touching scene to me was when their fourth child was born and Ben, who was the oldest of the four boys, including the newborn, got to see him before he died.
'Go Toward the Light' has many emotive scenes: notably, Ben's funeral where his mother recounts how her son's life may have been short but he had made his mark on the world, when Ben's father explains to his three young sons about what happens to the soul after death, and the final scene where Ben dies in his parents' arms.
We shared their joy when Ben is able to come home for his new brother's birth and when the Madisons' newborn son was haemophiliac-free.
We get a sense of how close the family is by the large role the grandparents play in Ben's life (his grandfather poignantly made Ben's coffin) and the love Ben feels for his family, especially his brothers (one bittersweet moment is when his younger brother says he was visited by a ghostly Ben in the hours before Ben's death).
I liked the part when the ball was used to take out the minions of the Tall Man.
Seeing your boy die and holding him in your hands when he goes towards the light Â being with him when he leaves this world as you were with him when he made his first breath Â this is the most painful experience for any parent.
They resolve the case and Shu-hoi becomes famous; when May vanishes in the forest, Shu-hoi and Detective Ha seek her out.
Moral when it serves them, ideologists when they are allowed to be, are "always right", always victims and always do what they want in the end.
He never really knew his father, who had ran away when Christoffer was 12 years old.
Fourteen years of feelings are not thrown away so easily when there is goodwill present, even in the face of what might be irrevocable breakdown.
What was the director thinking when he put these two amateurs in the team that had Soumitra Chatterjee, Victor Banerjee and Mamata Shankar in its revered cast ?
Does Mr Dutt actually know what the usual Bong does when he/she goes to "phoren" lands these days?
I made a huge mistake when I began to watch the 'Phantasm' series.
We finally start to get some answers as to when and how this all started.
He digs underground and when he comes up into the air he thinks he has landed in a perfectly normal safe place.
Soon Bugs is in stripes, but it's the guard who will find prison life to be hell when Bugs Bunny is around to trick him into a cell, the hangman's noose, an electric chair and even into the warden's office, where Bugs will put a severe strain on the relationship between boss and underling.
But their laid-back weekend turns into a horrific tragedy when they are attacked by two deformed psychos in jumpsuits... and they seem to have a link to the motel and a strange old woman that runs the place.
I have seen hell and it is when the sheriff kisses the old woman!!!
But, the make-up for the faces of the mutant, silent, skulking killers are cheap and unconvincing, especially when one of them gets bashed in the head with the butt of a shot gun.
The two sisters arrive the next day with friends of theirs and begin the usual fun-in-the-sun activities by the lake, but when two of their number disappear and they go looking for them, they find them dead, hanging from a tree.
It's well photographed, and I liked when the guy beat one of the killers over the head with a wooden chair while he was still tied to it, and a couple of other scenes, but as soon as the movie would come to life, it would quickly fall back into a familiar predictable pattern of said earlier movies in the very next scene.
I went and seen this at a theater when they they had the After Dark Horrorfest playing, and I was really impressed.
Lucky for me, with hopes set low, there's less room for them to fall when I'm inevitably disappointed.
when u cant see any dead bodies at the first 30 minutes in the movie, then, its a non-watchable film, dare!
I hope some others from horrorfest are worth watching, but I won't chance it now (not when you have to pay full price for every single movie).
This series has always been a riddle, always an enigma, and the answers are as difficult to see when they're right in front of you as perhaps the destination of one of the Tall Man's dimensional forks.
I'm sure everyone has a theory of what was meant or implied by a lot of the events of Phantasm IV, and here's my personal take that I strongly believe in, so much so that when I watch part IV, it brings tears to my eyes, every time, without fail.
All the flashback footage we are shown in part IV finally reveals what REALLY happened when Michael first encountered the Tall Man.
I don't need to see two fools flirt, while ones girlfriend is havin' a snooze to understand what goes on when they "get wood."
Well, grandpa gets it at the very beginning of the film, when he decides enough is enough, apparently, although a little late, I'd say.
However, when the first murder takes place, that's when his TBS drama turns into a Fright Night.
When the sisters begin to display real emotion, when the male character becomes the hero and villains become more real and into their characters.
Scares were not big in this movie, but when they did appear, it was okay.
There is a point when the killer pickaxes a girl in the ear and she cries blood as her eye turns red, yeah, a great example of classic slasher horror.
The one thing that seems to be a theme to the overall film is the past mistakes Mike made when facing The Tall Man.
This is Kate Beckinsale back when she acted instead of did action movies for big bucks.
It is unrealistic that Aunt Ada can be redeemed so easily but I like the way she was played, as having an epiphany when the American film Czar Mr.
While we Americans(I say we, since I'm American even though I'm landed in Canada) tend to think of Monty Python when we think of British humor, there's also a satirical type of humor that seems to be unique to Britain.
It can get rather dry, so dry that it's simply not funny(like the novel LUCKY JIM), but when it works, it's great to watch, and it works here.
Eileen Atkins' scenery chewing when her son, played by Rufus Sewell, was leaving home to become a Hollywood film star, just about had me in hysterics.
Great Aunt Ada Doom is at the core of their lives even when not present.
I was about 15 to 20 minutes into the film when it began looking familiar and I realized I had, ergo, why I say its not one you would remember.
Growing up is part of life and it is seen some what here as a young man transitions into manhood, all be it, Mulroney was 28 when he played the part.
Shows Rio de Janeiro when in a hypocrite society, who just ignored social problems like poverty, color distinction and others, that still existing.
This film goes further to put his life into context in the racial mix of Brazil of the 1930s, when slaves were freed but not allowed to hold jobs, the Brazil of Carnival where even the most macho men appear in drag.
In Dutch you say: als je voor een dubbeltje geboren bent wordt je nooit een kwartje (when you are born as a nickel you'll never become a quarter.
Alas, tragedy strikes when a loud mouth drunk begins to insult Joao, who decides to take matters into his own hand with dire consequences.
But when you enjoy a series of films so much do you really want to see it end?
But I can remember loving it when I saw it some 25 years ago.
It is low budget and simplistic, but it had kid appeal when we didn't have 200 tv stations to choose from and video stores at every corners.
If I were 4 or 5 years old as I was when I saw the picture I would seriously impress upon you the qualities of this film.
Often when you manage to catch a hold of things from your childhood they are not as well made as you remember them, but, if it really sticks in your mind they must have got something right other than just glossy special effects we now come to expect.
First, it was very hard to believe that when the school teacher found evidence of who the serial killer was, she would keep this to herself--even if she did like the person a lot.
Secondly, the film only had one or two plot twists and there really were no other potential people portrayed in the movie who could have been the murderer, so the identity of the actual criminal wasn't in much doubt--even when a little plot twist was added to make you possibly doubt it was really him.
Claude Chabrol, the French director of many thrillers and dramas and other genres, is at his best when subtly but forcefully pulling the rug out from the viewer.
This stretches out into the first half of the film; a friendship develops around food that Paul brings over, and it's only when Paul thinks its time to go the 'next step' that he's told it can't be because of a past horrible relationship that Helen faced- horrible in the sense of disappointment.
Then, when it switches gears bit by bit and the paranoia increases, by the time the climax comes it becomes very, ultimately, tragic.
There's imagination and striking imagery when required Â the film's most tense moment takes place during a fade to black, while a night time drive takes on a disembodied quality Â but he's not out to batter his audience with technique.
A murder victim is found by Helene when she has her class on a field trip to some caves.
But, when they meet each other, their neuroses come into the foreground: his animalistic passion and her ultra-civilized coolness nearly destroy each other.
When this film was made, despite the fact that Freud's theories were under attack, the film maker, Claude Chabrol, made a firm statement about what happens when a child's love for his mother is repressed by a father's hostility.
He can trust this woman because she is "logical," a word that turns up frequently when the two main characters describe how they run their lives.
As a birthday present, Helene presents her friend with a lighter; but things turn awry when the teacher discovers the latest victim...with the lighter she bought her friend at the scene of the crime.
However, when Popaul paints the ceiling of her house, she makes a discovery that affects her sense of security.
Another cute thing is when they return to the house later in the film, the shot-out windows are completely undamaged!
She ends up in the company of a mom (the luscious Erica Eleniak) and her teenage son (Jeremy Lelliott), and all hell breaks loose when the son finds the money.
Please understand that my score of 7 is based on when it was made.
The real reason for the movie is displayed about three quarters of the way through, when the stunning boat babes get into a wrestling match/fight with the male sailors on board the yacht.
Allow me to lay out the plot of this fiasco:  Sneaking dealings arise when Largo/Diabolico surfaces and kidnaps a patient of Dr. Connery.
Policewoman Lacy Bond,played by small dynamic redhead Sondra Currie,is a "supercop" assigned to take down a band of female gangsters who are up to all sorts of fiendish criminal activities.She uses(pretty basic)martial arts skills against them,and is later joined by undercover agent Pam Harris,played by Jeanie Bell,to help her take down the bad girl mob.The guys are generally pretty unimportant in this movie.Tony Young,as Lacy's boss and partner is reduced to a hapless sidekick,muttering his disapproval when he thinks she is putting herself in danger(and at one point having to be rescued by our heroine from some murderous babes who are beating him to death!
Besides, if there's a loose end here or there, who cares when you're having this much fun.
You have to wonder if Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman didn't go ape when Bernard Lee and Maxwell turned up in this.
First the various mob heads resent Ayres taking over, then they resent when he leaves.
In order to incite Louie back to the city, two gangsters plot to kidnap Jackie only to release him when Louie returns.
On hearing the news, Louie, now driven solely by vengeance on the would be kidnappers, returns to his old turf, but peace & profits are the last thing on his mind, and you half expect him to utter Al Pacino's memorable line "Just when I thought I was out....they pull me back in"  Ayres, although brilliant in his role was probably miscast, especially when you had the best movie tough guy in world playing the lead's sidekick.
This is actually rather ironic considering that in real life, Ayres was strongly opposed to violence and when drafted in WWII, served as a medic because he was so morally opposed to taking lives!
Mob boss Ayres is a supposedly smart man and retires from the mob when he's still very young and able to enjoy the spoils of his work.
But, when the gangs start fighting among themselves, he is reluctantly pulled back into the picture--leading to a rather dramatic conclusion.
The first thing she does when introduced to the Mother Superior is to uncover her breasts as a protest.
Though generally effective in the role, I did find it somewhat humorous when Ayres went into that surly pensive mood from time to time throughout the story.
I thought for sure that police captain Pat Grady (Robert Elliott - O'Grady in the credits) had it right when he offered the suggestion - "Don't write the last chapter till the night you go to the chair".
The scene in the cab when she removes her ring probably brought a few gasps to audiences of the time, don't you think?
Well,not in my Dad's instance,because when my Dad saw the film on the Screen, it was shortly after Bogart's death and Cagney was already a long since established star.But still a treat nonetheless.
If you were to watch this film without sound, you'd be hyper-aware of the wonderful camera set-ups and editing, particularly during the prison break, when the screen is filled with jump cuts of men's legs running.
It's a disaster, so 'cut to the chase' when you edit in future... pardon the pun.
Especially when it's kind of more like a torso with odd appendages.
My wife says we saw it when it was in the theaters but I can't say I remember.
One of my favourite scenes is when grandpa harnesses grannie into her corsets.
A wonderful look at the 40's when radio was king.
It's nice to think of it in the days when it enriched the imagination of everyone listening.
But this movie, about the days when RADIO was the main thing, not TV - really made me think about what life was like for my Mom and Dad in the 40's.
Not an easy thing to do when an actress like Mia Farrow, so famous for so many years, can disappear so fully into the far-fetched characters Woody creates.
The picture is crystal clear, and most of the acting is passable even when they've got their clothes on.
Woody Allen takes a look at the 1940s, when radio was still the dominant medium.
All in all, Woody Allen does best when he sticks to straight forward comedy and doesn't try to look at neurotic rich New Yorkers.
Do you remember the times before television when people listened to radio?
Woody Allen's Radio Days (1987) is a nostalgic look at those times.Mr Allen isn't seen in this movie, only heard.Seth Green plays in a way the young Woody Allen.Only that his name isn't Woody but Joe.This Jewish boy lives his life in New York under World War II.And listens to radio.The acting work is superb in this movie.Young Seth Green is excellent.Then there are names like Mike Starr (Burglar), Julie Kavner (Mother), Wallace Shawn (Masked Avenger), Dianne Wiest (Bea), Mia Farrow (Sally White), Larry David (Communist Neighbor), Danny Aiello (Rocco), Jeff Daniels (Biff Baxter), Mercedes Ruehl (Ad men), Diane Keaton (New Year's Singer) and William H. Macy (Radio actor).The movie is wonderfully written, by Mr. Allen naturally.This is a walk down the memory lane.A look at the past, at the 1940's, at the radio days.This is funny and sad movie filled with nostalgia, with memories of Woody Allen.At the end when there is the New Year's Eve, Woody says these words as the narrator; "with the passing of each New Year's Eve, those voices do seem to grow dimmer and dimmer."
I've been a Woody Allen fan since the 1970s, when I was about 20, and this gem is one of his absolute best.
She is one of Woody's favorite actress' especially when she appeared in Hannah and Her Sisters.
One of my favorite lines is when she tells a top radio producer in her high-pitched nasal voice, "Jeez.
Slows just a tiny bit when the wizened little 'man of God' turns up to exorcise the place but we are soon storming to a super finale as the poor man walks the corridors splashing his holy water whilst the girls are inside their rooms making their own little splashes.
Radio Days presents a time when America was dealing with the Great Depression and its after effects and the horrible event that was World War II.
He never told us if she found it...  "I never forgot that New Year's Eve when Aunt Bea awakened me to watch 1944 come in.
I thought I was being original when I made the connection between Woody Allen's "Radio Days" and Federico Fellini's "Amarcord," but I was being naive.
Very scary stuff, when you really think about it.
Believe me when I say I love movies and I like all sorts.
My conclusion was that they were serious and that was when I took the DVD out.
But trust me your patience will pay off when you watch this film.
I stumbled across it on USA and stayed because the guy from that Crow Stairway To Heaven show was in it, and I always felt he was a decent actor on the rare occasions when I watched that show.
I have never seen a film before that when I first watched it, it completely blew me away - something that has never happened before.
The new guy is hard, but eventually Mark Dacascos, through sheer willpower and thirst for freedom, defeats the baddie when the guy's heart overloads and kills him.
The dialog and would be humor is too obvious and the movie really only comes to life when Dacascos springs back in action.
What Toby neglects to tell Malik in the haste of the moment when they first meet, is that he is an enhanced human, with a powerful bionic booster implant on his heart.
After a slow first ten minutes when we get introduced to the main characters Toby Wong (an excellent Mark Dacascos)and Malik Brody (equally as good Kadeem Hardison) the action gets under way and doesn't stop until the closing credits.
I thought his work in Hostage was magnificent but here he's even better, especially early on the film, when he's tired and sore; at the start of 16 Blocks, Willis--who's portrayed some of the most macho characters in films over the last 15 or so years--is almost unrecognizable.
At one point, when another character asks him an annoying riddle, he snaps, "Life's too long and you make it seem even longer."
The simple transport job gets more complicated when it turns out that people want the witness dead before he can testify--and those people are cops, led by Mosely's former partner, Frank Nugent (David Morse, who--as he always does--turns in a riveting performance that's marvelously restrained).
The only reason I give this film a nine instead of a ten is because there is one moment, late in the film, when the film uses a kind of tired trick on the audience; in case you're not as cynical as I am, I won't reveal what that moment is--but you'll recognize it just as soon as the moment begins to unfold.
What might have ended on a terribly low note was elevated to personal success when the teacher was allowed to see some positive results o all her hard work.
I went to see this movie, expecting to see a nice humorous action movie, but I was VERY disappointed when I left the cinema...
I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the IMDb rating!
I did not know that I'm going to see a remake from the beginning so I just felt a little uncomfortable when Vuk was introduced.
It is nothing like Taxi, movies like this should never see daylight, I'm ashamed to be Belgian when I see this horrible piece of filth.
But when the time has come to kill Koen, Bennie can't do it anymore, because he started to like Koen too much.
The story is nice, although it sometimes fails a bit when it wants to offer "too much story".
What a sigh of relief I could breathe when I watched the movie!
This show was a family favorite when I was growing up.
Indulging in drinking, even when he's working, Mosley is a man cruising along the rock bottom of his life and work.
The film follows John Kerry's winning the Democratic Party's nomination for President in Boston in July to his self destruction over the next four months when he blew a double digit lead in the polls against President Bush to end up losing in the November elections by 50.7 % to 48.3 % of the popular vote!
John Kerry who was a hero in Vietnam now turned out to be a first class wimp, by letting Bush & the Republicans step all over him, when running for the highest office in the land.
The most revealing parts, however, come towards the end of the film, when we see massively long lines of African-American voters waiting to cast their ballot whilst Anglo voters waltz into the polling place and vote within seconds.
It goes approximately like this: Doreen: Why did you leave when your mother died?
I saw the original on TV years ago when I was a kid.
Then when he finds out what happened to his niece that really sets him off and drives him even further.
The stranger rides in to town, makes the bad guys pay and then rides off into the sunset when his work is done.
In the new version you also got to see where Richie's wife and daughter were coming from when Jack shows up after years.
There is barely any action (unless you call seeing Stalone's aged and vein-ridden muscles action) and when there was a car chase or fight scene, it was just ... boring.
This film undeservedly took a bashing when it was released and since then Get Carter '71 fans have insistently tried to bury it.
It was hard to care about any of the characters in the original and films usually lose points with me when I cannot fully connect with a character.
Something that was admirable as well was that the director kept the language to a minimum when he could've gone all out, and, while gritty, the violence is most of the time bloodless.
I generally hate about 80% of what Stallone puts out, but when I like him, I like him a lot.
You know the feeling you get when an actor is so bad you feel embarrassed for them?
I did found myself looking at my watch a lot and wondering when this was going to be over.
I say the only reason this movie is watchable besides the usual Stallone delivery is because of Rachel Leigh Cook...this was back when she was in her true prime and she is GORGEOUS in the movie.
But he reaches a moment in his life when the things that take place between him and his boss's girl Audrey, the things that he finds out about his brother and his brother's family, all of them act as a catalyst.
Although when looking back at Oscar (his 1991 comedy), D-Tox (a very underrated movie) and Copland I have to say that this is not a one off.
For some unknown reason, the industry 'suits' have decided to black-list Sylvester Stallone, not giving him large leading roles, and when they give him a role, they refuse to heavily market his films.
That all changes when he meets, by chance, a young Polish girl, Miss Sten, who inspires him to write a novel.
The kind of movie that might have been made in the fifties, when Hollywood was beginning to discover police stories and the gritty cities, with a B cast.
And when Willis and Mos are on the bus, why doesn't Willis just call in the police negotiator and explain things to him.
Especially when Cooper sat on the end of the bed during his conversation (which was by itself quite the fuss back than)with the girl.
This was the moment when you can see the strength under the airy facade, of Vinson's character.
Didn't expect this movie to go there...  And then when her father, who was introduced as an amiable figure, gets so angry at Sten that he slaps her face with such intensity.
I invited anyone who enjoys a movie of old, when it was about entertainment rather than depraved education to make the attempt to find a copy, sit back and enjoy.
I had heard about this film and about how underrated it was,then last week i saw a copy of it on ebay on VHS PAL UK.I was really surprised as i didn't think it had ever been released in the UK.It must be one of the rarest videos in Britain as sadly not many people have heard of it.Luckily i won it for just over Â£3 not bad eh.So if any one else is interested in buying a copy,there must be others available in Britain,if you really look around.I couldn't wait to watch this film,and i must say i wasn't disappointed.Its starts off a mildly amusing story that suddenly gets sadder and sadder until it reaches a climax to a very tragic ending.I must admit the last 10 seconds of this film does bring tears to the eyes,i wont say why,but try and see this movie and you will see.The acting between Gary Cooper and Anna Sten is first rate,her character is very likable as she is totally unselfish,and is trying to please everyone,so she does deserve happiness.Garys character,well he is married and his wife is not a monster and she does love him,so you feel sorry for her as well,i think you have to decide for yourself in a triangle like this someone is always going to get hurt,but you don't know who.Also this is a very early film showing us cultural differences and the sort of conflicts that can arise when two people from very different back grounds want to be together.Can it work?he is from a literate sophisticated family,she is from a poor immigrant family that is still trying to learn new ways.The answer is if two people really love each other then they can over come their differences as true love conquers all,i think overall this was the strongest message that comes out of this film,to some people the married issue may be the point of the film.Any way this is a very haunting film and well worth watching if you get the chance.
When oh when will I learn that the bargain priced movies in the bin at Walmart are there for one reason.
In the movie his has a red light that when it goes off he know an unauthorized entry at a Russian Nuclear missile silo has occurred.
It would still have a red light, but it would only go off when someone made a really good memorable action movie.
There is a lovely moment when the main guy who if he doesn't not land the role of Superman will be a revolt.
Yes don't regret living when you wont even give it a chance.
A few nights later, Daisy and the Lodger are spooning on a bench by a lamppost when Joe comes along and assails the Lodger's impudence at moving in on his girl.
Certainly, Daisy has no doubts about him, for she resists when Joe arrests him.
Taking advantage of the confusion when Daisy's mother faints at the news, the Lodger, handcuffed, bolts and escapes.
Another Jack once said to never trust a man who has no alcoholic drinks to serve you when you come to his house.
A lot of people do not believe me when I say that there is a Care Rank Ki Alien American Secret Service Elizabeth Regina alliance but I am telling you truthfully that there is as the American Shadow Vice President Brad HD Morgan.
I first saw it when I was 9 (I'm now 13), and I did not find it too scary.
The story is very easy to follow and everything is made very clear when there is no sound.
For example the fog when he first enters, the flickering light as if something is going to happen etc.
I didn't expect it to be that good when I was going to see it but it really blew me away that he already was so inventing in building up suspense.
A young Hitchcock (he was my age when he made the film, about 27 or 28) allowed himself to be swayed by popular and studio pressure much more than he would later in his career, since he allowed the entire ending of this film to be altered based on the popularity of it's handsome star, stage actor Ivor Novello.
Things begin to come to a head when Young Daisy Bunting's developing friendship with the new lodger begins to attract the jealous attention of her young police detective lover (Malcolm Keen) and when Mrs Ault notices his mysterious night-time sojourn on a bloody murderous Tuesday.
I liked the editing style when we see a crowd gather around the corpse of one of the Avenger.
And I loved seeing a little note of romance, as a character cuts out a little heart-shaped piece of dough and hands it to Daisy (played by, simply named, 'June' who is a beauty), coaxingly, but then when not accepted right away he rips it in two.
13 on the front door when Ivor Novello's character knocks on the door in the beginning.
The story retraces the Ripper case, which by the time when the film was made was still present in the living memory of many London inhabitants.
It was Hitchcock first major Success and one of two films in the 20's (the other was "Blackmail") that gave him an enormous reputation , It offers a possible explanation for"Jack the Ripper" and shows the beginning of many Hitchcock trademarks such as the Wrong Man on the run, fetishistic sexuality and murder, Death and Pleasure, In the Dark Thick Fog, London is awash with fear and loathing over a serial sex murder known as "The Avenger" who targets Blond Woman in particular and leaves their warm corpse lying in the street ,He always strikes on a Tuesday, his Face is covered, and Leaves his calling card always tucked away in the victims pocket, On a Tuesday night Daisy Bunting(June Tipp) a Model comes home to her little flat she shares with her family, her boyfriend(Malcolm Keen) the local chief of police is there boasting how he's going to catch the"avenger killer while flipping a coin in the air, Suddenly the Gas meter switches off and while Daisys Father (Arthur Chesney) goes to insert another coin in , The house goes dark All of A sudden their is a knock on the Door and Mrs Bunting (Played beautifully by Marie Ault) Opens the Door to a pall faced Tall man with his face Covered (Ivor Novello) inquiring about the room for let upstairs,The Pale Antisocial Asexual Unnamed man begins his association with the family and starts More trouble than they can possibility imagine, especially when we seems to take Interest in Daisy who Just Happens to be Fair Haired.Suspicion Falls upon the odd Introvert and coincidence seems to follow fact as Tuesday Night Comes Around Again and another scream is heard in the Depths of the London Fog.
Fritz Langs film work work particularly "M" (a film about a child molester and Serial Murderer) made a profound impression on the Work of Hitchcock .It would be a strange coincidence that in his Last American Film Friz Lang Would Pay Homage to him in "Beyond Reasonable Doubt" This film has all the trademarks of the latter Hitchcock s films and is greatly enhanced by the great use of film montage of German Expressionist Films to which Hitchcock learned his trade and made a point of his style This Film has been Remade four times as recently as 2009 and the second even starred Novello himself however there's is no comparison There are some who say Hitchcock was always a bit of a silent film director with his use of great lengthy scenes without dialogue, and if you watch this u can see why everything in the stories plot comes across clear as a bell its not a dodgy DW Griffith with too much montage to millions of Credit cards to Tell you whats happening, you can see exactly whats going on, you can tell when something horrible is going to happen to the sweet blond victim , and you are given that same 'suspend belief' that's in all the Great Hitchcock Films of his Golden Period .
And when the lodger is pacing back and forth in his upstairs room, the family look up at the ceiling at the jiggling chandelier and the ceiling becomes transparent so we can see the shoes of the suspect.
The landlady reluctantly allows him to stay in an upstairs room, but becomes suspicious when she notices the young man turning over all the portraits of blonde-haired women in his room.
It doesn't help the landlady's suspicions when the man begins showing an interest in her daughter, Daisy (naturally, a blonde).
I mean Son is really bad; I've heard Peter Sellers (the original Inspector Clouseau) roll in his grave a time or two, but I thought there was thunder outside when I saw this.
Especially when it provides the background for a battle between an animated Benigni and the famous Pink Panther cartoon character, racing around a live action concert hall.
Great actor don't get me wrong, but he hardly sounds like Dean when he talks.
I think the fault with the movie was that it was made when only one of the duo has passed on, so perhaps there were Lewis traits that had to be down graded at the expense of Martin.
This movie starts in the 1940's and showcases the beginning of both of these show business legends and implies that both were struggling and about to go under when, according to this film, both were booked at the same club and Lewis inserted himself into Martin's act and the audience thought they were so funny together that they became an act that sold out nightclubs and eventually segued into a lucrative movie career.
I really enjoyed this the first time I saw it in the theater in 1969, and again when I found the DVD in 2001.
I saw this movie in December of 1968 when it was first released in the US.
I started being a movie buff when I was very young.
I saw this when it was making the Drive-In circuit and since there is nudity in this movie it must have been rated R but 14 year-old's had no problem getting into Drive-In features.
I had mostly forgotten much about this and then a few years ago when DVD's started replacing videos I found a video of this in a nice hard shell case on wide screen format at less than half price so I bought it, watched half of it and forgot about it again.
What i really tried to figure out when i was watching this movie is why do all these stars show up in this movie, the only explanations i can think of is that they lost a bet or the cast was blowing their heads off during filming.
The L.P got lost in 1975 when I got married and moved but I have just bought the new D.V.D which is really great to see again, after all the years.
Other than at my house, where I STILL frequently say, at any given opportunity, especially when confronted by anyone about anything I've supposedly done to vex them, "Emmanuel GOOD boy!"
The stereo soundtrack, (ABC ABCS-OC-9)featuring backgrounds by Dave Grusin, Steppenwolf and a wicked version of The Byrds' "Child of the Universe" is long out of print, and I have read that the master tapes were discarded in a 1970's clean out when ABC was sold.  
the Matthau, but I laughed even as this absurd chapter came to a close...it's a product of an era when not only sex, but laughter and freedom, were celebrated and must be seen in that mindset...this is a movie that people who write certain modern movie guidebooks will never, ever, ever understand...for the simple reason that, in this era, as prurience increases, thus does narrowmindedness, so that we come to forget completely the now remote atmosphere in which such a film could be made.
It comes when he is asked to look the other way as his buddy's (most prominently David Morse, as the sociopathic ex partner) rub out an informant that Willis is dutifully transporting to the Court house.
Just when I thought that the movie was going to have me accepting the epiphany as a typical Hollywood clichÃ©, it offers an explanation that is quite believable.
In The B E Kutcher remembers parts in the past that have been blocked because they are memories best forgotten, with more tragic consequences when the events are changed.
I laughed out loud, and was surprised by a little twist when Will decides to return to when he dug up the relic.
I loved that I could take my kids, when most festivals (unless they are "family" festivals" show the most outrageous films they can find.)
As it goes so often in life, we want so much to believe in something outside of ourselves, that we cherish those moments in life when fantasy is solid enough to appear real.
Most of us lose that sense of wonder as we grow up and grow old, so when something comes along that restores that wonderment, if even for two hours, we should be quick to jump at it, allowing childlike acceptance take control.
Oh, yes, he does stuff in secret, when no one confronts him, but if someone does, he runs scared.
The thick military man and the unimaginative mother wake up to the truth when they see the creature and everyone lives happily ever after.
One addition of the film that is not too bothersome is that the water horse is not very cute at all when he is "fully grown".
The boy leaves it for a while and when he comes back to it, the "stone" is broken and a strange creature has hatched out...
It falls short when it comes to editing.
It comes across as a children's movie, and the utter cuteness that the creature possesses when it is young will just make you go "Aww" at times.
), and when he would yell it was almost ear shattering, but other than that, "The Water Horse" is an excellent family film.
Only one Water Horse can exist a time and the old one lays a single egg when it dies.
Few enhanced effects are visible when Crusoe is off screen.
The dangers to the water horse are presented when he (it?)
Seeing the full-grown Cruscoe rise from the depths of the water had us both wildly cheering out loud, and the scene when the kid rode on his back and went for an underwater sea romp was pure celluloid gold -- beautifully filmed and an AMAZING RIDE!!!!
In that sense i mean you go "oh hes about to get caught" when the unexpected comes up.
Dropping to low sad tones when death is about to occur, and jumping to a pulsing drum run when escape is occurring.
Having done that as an amateur, I was surprised when the pros did this!
I read about the legend of Loch Ness when I was about 6 years old and imagined and fantasized how awesome it would be to see and witness something like that - this is probably as close as I will ever come - so in essence, I've waited 30 years for this movie - and my family and I enjoyed it very much.
In the end, I greatly enjoyed this film, and plan to add it to my vast collection when it is released for home viewing.
It's a different version of Free Willy I think, lol, sounds crazy, I know, but I think you'll agree when you see it.
But when Agnus comes across what looks like a strange rock, is actually an egg left by an Water Horse, the rarest of all creatures, there can only be one in the world at a time.
But when the water horse, he named Crusoe, has grown too big, he and a family friend put him in the Lochness Lake where he is spotted and is now known as the infamous Lochness Monster.
The former student keeps an eye on the teacher when she leaves the hospital, and soon his family (wife and two children) becomes involved as well.
When you watch O'Hara, think about what most of the current crop of "actresses" will look like and what their performances will be like when they are in their eighties--if any of them manage to maintain a career past the age of thirty.
The Irish temperament,at times,thick accent,especially when angered, her natural beauty, are what set her apart from other women of her generation.
As a woman whose great love ended before the relationship could fully develop, she imparts what she has learned to them about what's really important in this world, and what really stays with those we leave behind when we go into the next one.
I'm only have 3 years old when I see for first time this episode and let me tell you that this experience is still in my memory.
Mesmerizing in its power, just as effective today as when it was filmed in 1935.
The Crusades sees Richard meeting and marrying Princess Berengaria on the route to the Holy Land to fight in the Third Crusade and then having to rescue her when she is captured by Muslim leader Saladin, who has fallen in love with her.
In fact, the main reason Richard even takes up the cross in the movie is so that he can get out of marrying King Philip's sister (as he heard a holy man say that all earthly oaths will be erased once a person takes up the cross) and he is only motivated to attack Acre and Jerusalem when his wife is taken by Saladin.
The Crusades paints the European crusaders as having great zeal for their religion and thinking of nothing else when deciding whether or not to take up the cross and fight Muslims in the Holy Land.
The film is well shot (earning a Best Cinematography Oscar nomination) and has some good action scenes (for the 1930s anyway Â come one, when is it not fun to watch soldiers pour burning tar on an invading army?).
That said, Crusades lost money when first released, if you only look at its Domestic boxoffice rentals but was the biggest grossing movie of its year.
To begin with, being a fan of the epic genre, I had always wanted to check this one out and, in fact, was very pleased when Universal released it as part of their 5-Disc Cecil B.
It's a typical DeMille product characterized by topflight spectacle and action scenes and some arcane dialog, the kind that was used when DeMille was learning his trade from David Belasco in the early 20th century.
It is showed a bit humorously in the moment when Richard dares jump into his wife's bed, dedicated to John, Matthew, Luke and Mark... Another character that needs mentioning is the Hermit (C.Aubrey Smith).
He shines in the scene when visiting the royal assembly.
While DeMille had proved on Sign of the Cross (1932) and Cleopatra (1934) that he could make a big picture without masses of extras or impressive sets, he certainly knows how to make the most of those assets when he does have them.
And while DeMille clearly loves the massive crowd shot, he has enough sense to shrink the space and simplify the setting when it comes to key dialogue scenes.
It wasn't scheduled, but I happened to tune in to it when it started.
Six people are taking a tour of Ultra Studios when they get trapped in a haunted house (that's not usually on the tour, but they have VIP passes).
So when the action starts most of the time is up and there is not too much time for the horror to happen.
Why see this, when you can see Temptress Moon, which was richly embroidered with meaning, and did have scope, and it not only met, but exceeded propounded expectations?
One minute he hates her enough to spit in her tea when her back is turned; the next he smiles at her childish singing like the first fool in love in the history of the world.
Zhang knows when to move the camera, and he knows when to keep the damn thing still: it depends on what each scene calls for.
Shuisheng soon finds that she is not a nice person, and he gets back at her when he can.
This occurs when she is forced to go with the Boss to the country after a rival has attempted to kill him.
But the surprise is that in the process she is returned to her childhood when she herself was a country bumpkin.
This comparison with Scott brings me to the point in Triad when the empathy shifts from the boy to be shared by him and Bijou.
Of course it is helped when the viewer feels that the situation she is in is a frightening one, not unlike mountaineering where one false step could end up in death, at what ever height you are at.
It's not every day that a heavily opinionated young man will be reduced to a pathetic single syllable, but when Triad is finished, many of you will be reduced to it too, lay back and just clear your head of anything other than the film, all that enters the head will be "Wow".
The boy's whole attitude changes when he realizes this, and the question the film poses from here is ... what, if anything, can he do about it?
And this abrupt shift comes at a time when things are just getting interesting in the nightclub, when Shuisheng realizes "Miss" is very unhappy.
SHANGHAI TRIAD became my favourite Zhang Yimou film when I saw it some years ago, for the simple reason that it was one of the most beautiful films I'd seen.
This plot-packed and enjoyable but, ultimately, minor Harold Lloyd short gained some unexpected notoriety when the great comedian was seriously injured in an explosion during a publicity stunt for the film which cost him the loss of two fingers and necessitated the installation of prosthetics.
This was my third time viewing the film - the first as an extra on Image's DVD of the Silent version of THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927) and the second on TCM, as part of a Harold Lloyd marathon in anticipation of the release of this same 7-Disc collection, when I was in Hollywood late last year; actually, I liked it better this time around, hence I upped the rating from **1/2 (besides, back then, I wasn't as familiar with the star's short films as I am now)!
Harold loses the love of his life and wants to end it all.His all suicide attempts are failures.But he ends up marrying a pretty girl and ends up with her in a mansion that is spooked by a wicked uncle who wants to scare the young people away so he can have the place for himself.Alfred J. Goulding and Hal Roach are the directors of Haunted Spooks (1920).It's great to watch Harold Lloyd do his comedy.Mildred Davis is beautiful and brilliant as the girl.She would become Harold's real-life wife three years later.The film has lots of fun during its 25 minutes.It's awfully funny to watch Harold and Mildred in a car while those chicken and ducks peck him in the head.And comedy meets tragedy in all those suicide attempts.Lloyd sacrificed two of his fingers when a prop bomb exploded in his hand.What wouldn't Harold have done for comedy?
This is, in my opinion, extremely pointless to note for this when watching this film!
So there is nothing they could do about it when they released this onto an all-region DVD,which was were I watched it from.
I especially enjoyed the piece of music when the Boy and Girl entered into the mansion for the first time.
Also, I thought the Little Boy, played by Ernest Morrison, almost stole the show by creating the illusion of that table moving, hiding in the flour, which made him look like a ghost when he scrambled out of it, and creating that illusion with the big pair trousers really was hilarious.
Every time I see it, I forget how funny and romantic it is, and how good I feel inside when they get together.
Adam Sandler is fantastic - so sweet, but also hilariously (makes-you-feel) sympathetic when he gets mad at his ex-fiance in the song he shows Julia.
I'm not a very emotive person when it comes to films as I know that it's all fictional but Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore do make a believable couple.
Sandler portrays some-one in love extremely well, when he's singing to her he looks at her as if she's the only person on the whole plane which just sums up what love is really.
I've said it before,Adam Sandler does not do great films.He merely wants to entertain us.Though there are times when he has failed miserably,this is not the case with The Wedding Singer.While it does showcase Sandler's usual juvenile humor,this is by far his most likable character,even to date,and the chemistry between him and Drew Barrymore is undeniable.
They meet when Julia is waitressing at the place Robbie works at.
They soon meet again, when Barrymore is making plans for her own wedding (to a total jerk), even though deep inside she feels that she's "settling" for security without true love.
Meanwhile Sandler finds out about the two-timing bozo, when the groom-to-be brags about his adventures with every sexy girl that comes along.
His life gets worse one day, his wedding day, to be exact, when someone doesn't turn up.
Robot Chicken is a great show to watch when you just want to kick back and watch something on TV without having to think that much about the plot.
By far the best is when Darth Vader calls the Emperor after the Death Star has just been destroyed - "what's an aluminum falcon?!"
I love how when someone screams, their eyes are wide and their mouth.
It was just so funny, also in the end when Velma loses her virginity to him.
But everything turned on end when Dong Mi and Jung Joon end up in bed!
At least, that's what I thought when I first heard of it whilst browsing through my dad's collection of strange and funny series.
Among such names was the late, great Michael Jackson, where he was supposedly showing up for court when an alien spaceship landed and the still coloured Michael Jackson jumped out proclaiming that he had been abducted by aliens in their mad bid to take over the world.
I would have enjoyed this when I was in 3rd grade, but I also thought the parody of the Barney theme song was clever and funny (I hate you, you hate me, so lets go out and kill Barney...) Why do you think references to other TV shows and movies are so funny?
And when I found out it was on EVERY night on my favourite channel, as a replacement to some of my most-liked shows - I couldn't help but be very annoyed.
I don't have anything against crude comedy - in fact, I love it when it's well done.
Where else can you see Palpatine answer his phone with the phrase "Go For Papa Palpatine" then lay into Darth Vadar when he finds out the Death Star has been destroyed.
Because this is stop animation, you can pause the DVD and watch each frame to see how it changes, and in some scenes the creators throw in something that you can't see when it's played at normal speed.
In addition, Margaret's parents, particularly her mother, become alarmed and angry when Margaret asserts her independence as she gets older.
In the tradition of "It's a Wonderful Life", "Love is Never Silent" builds and sets the stage throughout the movie for the highly emotional scene towards the end of the film when Margaret finally stands up to her demanding parents.
The characters in this 'animation' are created primarily from plastic, allowing for an almost 'toy look', which especially reins in when a skit reflects that of a prior toy.
And when the creators are brave enough to stop suckling on pop cultures nurturing teat for a few seconds, we often are left a 5 (or less) second clip of something so creatively dull and brain dead the only plausible reaction is that of total silence.
I do like claymation when its done right, and there's none of that here.
The thing is so fake, we both burst into laughter when the sound track included a parrot squawking.
I watched this movie in my ASL 1 class and it really made me think, when i went home and told my mom about the movie she told me she had seen it when she was little and it had hit home.
They drink coffee and get stoned when they go home.
Another old goodie from RKO studios, in the era when they were churning out spy melodramas almost by the dozen.
The question of the father when he asks his daughter to describe what sound the sun makes.
Hotel Reserve is an interesting little thriller set before World War 2 and I taped this when BBC2 screened it one afternoon.
A medical student on holiday in France is arrested for spying when some photos are developed showing something to do with the Army or Navy.
Now I am not really saying I want the really little kids out there to see ultra-violent films, but there gets to be a point when a film is so non-offensive and sweet that it nearly puts the viewers in a diabetic coma!
At the start of the movie, they are starting to be befriended by the Bears when Friend and Secret Bear come by them on the city streets.
It encourages children to be empathetic and kind when it comes to other people, that good can often triumph over bad if people work together, and that there is always room for a miracle.
Someday, when I have children, they will definitely be watching this movie!
its also when you first meet the care bear cousins, which are a bunch of jungle animals and at the end they all get their little tummy-pictures.
its a really great movie to rent when your in a happy mood.
Remember the horror movie you wanted to make when you were a kid?
In the 90's, when I watched this movie for the first time, I was very impressed with such a tight screenplay and outstanding performances of the cast, and I decided to "recheck" my first impression.
Although, they have to take responsibility in it, when it's them that started the life together in the first place.
The plot thickens when he is found dead.
I saw this movie when it first debuted and I have never forgotten the vivid performances and how I cried.
The scene with her mother, beautifully played by Phyllis Frelich, when her mother calls her selfish is one of the best scenes, bar NONE, that I have ever seen in my life.
Bruce Willis does what he does best; that is to say, he's annoying to the point where I was hoping someone would kill him and put us all out of our misery, even though I thoroughly enjoyed his character when he wasn't being mean to his wife.
Joyce is married to the insufferable Jimmy (Willis), who alternately ignores, harasses, and hits her, when he's not out partying.
Demi Moore stars as Cynthia Kellogg, a woman caught in the middle when her best friend (played by Glenne Headly) murders her jerk of a husband -- or so it seems.
On a mission in Vietnam Kirk, Mike and Polo are the only survivors of their platoon who rescue a bunch of children, but Polo stays behind when they get to their boat and tells them to leave.
I caught up with this movie in the late eighties when I rented it on a local video store.
The action takes place in a small, enclosed camp, with Muller and the girl running from building to building, yet Strode and the most poorly-trained, inefficient platoon this side of "Gomer Pyle USMC" can't seem to see them, and even when they do, they all run after them one at a time, enabling Muller to easily dispose of them.
I was disappointed when I first saw this, and recently wanted to see if it had improved with time.
You pretty much know you're getting an heroic picture about Americans in battle when watching a war movie from 1943, so that helps set the stage up-front.
There were endless aspects of the movie that tried the viewer, even in 1943: maudlin speeches by the chaplain, nurses, and others (including a speech in a love letter at the end of the movie) every 15 minutes or so; front line soldiers and a Marine (who for some reason wanders around all alone in an Army unit, on the voyage over and in the Philippines when he should have been with his fellow Marines in the 4th Marine Regiment) who nonchalantly stroll back and forth at will from the front lines to the rear to schmooze with their girl friends; fraternization (absolutely forbidden) between a nurse and the (apparently) lost enlisted Marine (who is a PFC in his blouse and a Pvt.
She served in Bataan and Corrigedor during the time when McArthur withdrew to Australia.
you wont believe this...i was 16 when i saw so proudly we hail....thirty years later i resaw it and remembered everything about it...even the theme music of claudette and george.
Parts of it are told in narrative style which lends a historic credibility to it, but the main focus on the movie is the hardships that our service personnel face when placed in tough situations.
Veronica Lake, in what seems to be an early "goth girl" performance, shows us what it is like when women get too close to the front lines.
These nurses are in the Phillipines when MacArthur pulls out and they become stranded on Corregidor.
The film is told in flashbacks, when the women are actually on their way home by ship, and Colbert, who plays "Davy" (Janet Davidson) is catatonic.
Unfortunately, that happened to many actors who were just getting a foothold when war broke out.
I saw this film when it first came out.
But if you remember it was made at a time when we weren't sure how the war would come out, the context keeps patriotism in perspective.
"So Proudly We Hail" was a timely film when it was made and 60+ years later its message is still relevant as an historical event.
I hate it when the box description on a video is totally wrong.
Like "Cry Havoc" (also made in 1943 but with a small cast and a modest set), this is a film about American Army nurses stranded on Corregidor, Philippines during the horrific time when General MacArthur was ordered to retreat to Australia.
Hollywood deserves a big hand of applause for making SO PROUDLY WE HAIL at a time when the U.S. was still involved in WW2 and our struggles to overcome the Japanese in the Pacific.
It's still pretty impressive, although some of the flag-waving gets a little heavy and the suds flow pretty freely when the nurses discover romance.
Experiments funded by the military has a staggering side-effect when the head scientist, Dr. Van Fleet(James Hong)discovers that an alternate universe exists when a subject is induced into a vast, deep sleep..something sinister lies on the other side and uses the subject as a portal into our world.
Through Hickock, Beecroft is a no-nonsense, take-charge kind of character who is realistic and practical when faced with a really difficult situation, which he certainly inherits when searching for the truth regarding the death of a civilian.
The being itself is a series of monsters, not particularly as scary now due to the advancement in special effects(..or as effective as say Bottin's work in THE THING or Stan Winston's work in PUMPKINHEAD), but effectively grotesque when they pop up on characters..the monkey creature is quite a ghastly creation.
Shawn Weatherly is scientist Dr. Kidwell, who is so attached to her pet monkey(..a supposed lab animal no longer needed when Van Fleet began to test human subjects)she'll risk her life to find it when it goes missing..the twist regarding her finding a monkey is a doozy.
The first time i ever saw this movie was probably in 1992 when this was still on the video shelves and as far as SciFi Horror goes, this is one of the very best there is.
Ah, the 80s, when Full Moon/Empire/Whatever movies still had a budget and were actually watchable.
There's hope- the old cameraman blasted into admiration and respect for Agnieska when she shows she'll do his job for him.
The film time-slices from the 1970s, when Agnieszka is making her film, to previous times, all the way back to mock documentary footage of Birkut in the 1950s.
The presentation is anything but flattering to the Communist Party and it is astounding the Wajda was able to get this made in a time when the Communists were still in power in Poland.
For example, one scene has Burkit's friend Witek going into a small office of a party boss and, when Burkit enters the office some time later there is no sign of Witek.
Women are to be ignored, but when they push themselves on you, you give in but get them to do what you want them to do.
Then, when someone is about to meet a terrible end, we see a long shot with a lot of weird light.
I was looking through my satellite guide to find when this movie was on because I am a big fan of Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis as well.
They dream about being really hot when they were sixteen.
Another aspect of this film that I enjoyed was that, while there are humorous (and absurd) things that happen when we are single, this DOES show that, but not as so much ridiculous fluff.
But when she meets him one day at Ollie's she starts to discuss her problems.
She tries to be protective of Debbie (Thurman) when she sees her being hurt by yet another bad relationship.
It's a heart wrenching performance, and one that I recognized to the core of me from my own club days, during the times of my life when I was so lonely that I couldn't even *fake* self-respect convincingly.
Movies that capture the humanness of everyday people and environments, deserve kudos because it is not often when that happens.
Even at the end, when she was literally clinging to him in the bar, he didn't say anything mean or abusive, but told her, in a low key, not uncompassionate way, that she needed to go home and sober up.
She goes to the doctor when she temporarily goes blind.
Debby's mother Virginia(Rowlands) is strong, yet her daughter's resentment to her new boyfriend lead to her own remorse when the boyfriend died of a heart attack.
The resentment was caused when her father left the family.
You feel so bad for the characters when bad things happen.
I winced when Uma's character literally flung herself at a guy who is, like a recent book popular dating book says, is just not that into her.
Her father left her when she was quite young.
First, when I saw that movie in the guide i had never heard of it before but being a fan of Lewis and Thurman I couldn't let this pass even if apriori the plot SEEMED a little less than original.
You can see what a truly beautiful women is when even with an "altered down" image of herself (to say the least) you just can't get your eyes off her (yeah I'm a man)  I think the scene in the bar when she really goes loose is stunning and again it comes from a subtle chemistry between good directing and good acting, As a man I felt like the barman which the camera just give you a quick glimpse just to give you the hint.
The majority of the film is borrowed from It's a Mad Mad World, and when I say borrowed I mean copied without any distinction what so ever.
i remembered a scene from Mr. Bean's Holiday , when he gets locked up in a roadside loo , and also gets entangled with a young boy , who is left behind on the platform.
The twist to the situation , when they have to part with their prized booty , after going through so much of agony and calamities , is a real feather in the cap of the script writer .
Hey i had a hectic past month and then when i was free today, i thought I had earned the right to chill out with my friends, so I caught the noon show of Dhamaal.Well, how was it?
Some scenes left us all shaking with laughter, like the one in which Arshad 'calculates' the velocity of his car and the angle of projection and then throws a stone to check it, or when Riteish falls right into a luxury coach, which as luck would have it, was being hijacked, or the one in which Vijay Raaz talks about patience and going slow and later learns a lesson.
Yes, cheated, especially when i reached the IInd half and realised all the gags were copied from 'Rat Race'(2001) with slight changes to cater to the desi crowd.
These four friends going from Bombay to Goa for some money, but when money words comes, there is no place for any other thing.
That's when the trouble starts between the Beverly Hills neighbors and Ruth's own grown, wealthy, attorney daughter.
But while I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's "so bad, it's good", I will have to confess that there were times when I laughed because of the overwhelming stupidity.
My friends roared with laughter when I recounted this supposedly touching (oooh, bad pun!)
Quite refreshing during the Reagan years when Rock Hudson's death from AIDS shocked the world.
Possibly the best scene in the film is when Bobby comes to family dinner dressed in drag.
When I saw this TV movie in 1986 I was coming out and it really helped me at a time when I needed help.
I did not know what to expect when I picked up this DVD.
But Marcus steps on a mine and is submitted to a surgery, when a secret about his origins is disclosed.
It was all summed up when in a hotel room, the lead male character stands up, goes to leave the room, but forgets where the door is.
I mean you only have to look at some of David Lynch's work, and especially inland empire, to see just what can be done in the medium, but it is unredeemed dreck like this, which consistently mark DV, and DV film-makers as amateur, when it needn't be!
(Pronounced CHOON) The comedy starts when these two meet for the first time.
I saw this when it first aired.
The Destroyer series is known for corny jokes but Roddy McDowell's Chiun is pathetic when compared to Joel Grey.
I seen the pilot back in 1988 when the World Series finished before the seven games.
It was O.K., movies was better and it was not as good as the book series, but I always wanted a movies made so I was glad when it came out.
I started reading the books when they first came out and have collected most of them and re-read them often.
Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson) is on the trail of finding Colombian drug-lord, Calderone, who killed his partner (Jimmy Smit, who would later get killed on NYPD Blue), when his runs into Rico Tubbs (Philip Thomas) who's out to avenger his brother's death at the same man's hands.Miami Vice affected pretty much every aspect of American culture in the '80's.
Neither know the other is after the same man, both seeking revenge for the murder of a partner(..Crocket's partner was collateral damage when a drug dealer they were playing, having decided to go out on his own, was blown up with a bomb strapped under his truck).
But all hell breaks loose when the ship's original systems become active and accidentally fire upon and destroy ships of an alien fleet.
), and even the enemy aliens prove to be far more than just stock evil world-conquerers when their strange and ancient history proves that there really is something to the universal nature of basic "humanity."
Nearly half of the people left the cinema when I watched this film at a sneak preview in Germany!
At first they suspect it's a joke but when the first one disappears during a party and is found dead, things change and the students investigate / get slaughtered.
A group of the students become concerned when each receives a text message warning of their death in three days.
Things get real serious when a student is found dead.
But when you compare this movie with Austrian movies from the last 10 years, you will see, that Austrian movie makers try to reach an "international level".
Prochaska does, however, count on the surprise factor as well: not all in the script is a deja vu, and he takes advantage of those moments when we don't know what's gonna happen next to scare us witless, with almost sadistic joy (in terms of how off guard we're caught).
The travel itself is actually just an accident: when a mission goes wrong and hostilities ensue, the Enterprise flies towards the Sun and then away from it as quickly as possible.
It's all a playful, colorful adventure - which completely falls apart in the final act when they start transporting/beaming people into themselves - but hey, whatever gets you home.
So, when I heard that this movie was playing I immediately wanted to go.
You'll be anxious for the sequel when you leave the theater.
In short, I had a fantastic time watching it, and definitely would be going back to see it again when it opens.
Its really hard to contain myself when I'm talking to friends who haven't seen it yet who ask me how it was.
Even when Professor X was explaining to Wolverine about his school and mutantism, it didn't bog down the story at all, but kept it going as we got a better understanding of what was to happen.
Some of his long-time students, Cyclops (James Marsden of "27 Dresses") who sports special sunglasses to shield his lethal laser beam eyes; Storm (Halle Berry of "Die Another Day") who controls weather and deploys lightning bots; and Dr. Jean Grey serve as instructors when they aren't running errands for Xavier.
I was introduced to the "X-Men" as a kid in the 1990s when I started seeing episodes of the cartoon show.
I would say the story really gets good around the part when Logan (a.k.a.
I think everyone's good, but it's always hard when there's at least two Oscar winners, two Shakespearian actors and some other awards winners.
X-Men was a really entertaining, and overall great film.Than again, I use great in lowest term, but still, I think it deserves to be called great.This movie is one of those superhero movies that delivered and stuck.Most just deliver and then you forget about them, but this one always has to be one of the first superhero films that comes to mind when you think of that genre.The casting could've have been more perfect either.I mean, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, and Halle Berry.All of them I've seen in numerous amounts of films and I think they're all fantastic.This is a good movie, and I recommend it for basically anyone.
Also releasing that th main cyborg, Marcus right, has a human heart, and is in fact half human half machine, when if they had kept that quiet, it could of become a massive although guessable twist in the script.
I really enjoyed this movie a lot when it first came out 8 long years ago and I decided to revisit it with my little brother tonight and enjoyed it just as much as I did back then.
X-Men is my favourite comic book series, I have been a fan of the comic books and the animated series in the 90s and I was excited when I found out that they were making an X-Men film.
And what highlights they are - tremendous in both categories, at least for 2000 when this film and DVD came out.
We got to thinking about this when we realized that the mutants in the sci-fi thriller X-Men are of two types: the generous, moral, and intelligent ones, and the animal-like ones acting out of revenge and anger.
Fleeing to Alaska, Rogue meets Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), another mutant who has amazing healing powers, which come in handy when his retractable adamantium claws inadvertently inflict damage.
So when I heard they were making a movie about them, I was counting the days until it was released.
The sound Wolverine's claws make when they come out is exactly as I imagined it.
Magneto's plan for world domination is actually pretty stupid when you think about it and that is a shame because much of the exposition is very well done.
Yes, there are a lot of good sophisticated films, but when something as brainless and moodless as this comes around, I'm still able to enjoy it.
The true battle of good versus evil can always make for a great story but when a comic book is adapted to film and you feel that what you see is really possible, it is a true stroke of genius.
Honestly, I was a little disappointed that the colorful high-flare costumes were omitted, but I instantly forgave Singer when I realized why.
My only problem is that I was too young to appreciate both AbFab and High Society when they first started airing.
It becomes doubly tragic, then, when the fates demand such a harsh, unforgiving punishment from him.
He only becomes useful in the end when he gives John his heart.
Also, when Arnold fights John, why doesn't he just pull his heart out?
What is a blown-up plastic Barbie doll doing in a movie that is situated in the early eighties, when plastic surgery was not even properly born yet??
An other revealing mistake is the American guy/gay, who shows up in the last part of the movie; quite confusing when a character who is so proud of his multi-lingual talents has such a strong foreign accent when he speaks his mother tongue...
As written by TÃ©chinÃ©, Laurent Guyot, and Viviane Zingg this film is a love story and a social commentary on life in 1984 when AIDS raised its ugly head and disrupted lives, hopes and relationships.
AndrÃ© TÃ©chinÃ©'s new movie about criss-crossing relationships marked by the AIDS crisis begins when Adrien (Michel Blanc), a respectable gay doctor, picks up a young, eager and definitely gay country boy from the mountains in a Parisian cruising area.
Adrien's idyll ends when Manu gets a job in a remote camping ground and starts an affair with a bisexual vice cop of Arab extraction named Mehdi (Sami Bouajila).
It's disconcerting to discover that Manu isn't central to The Witnesses because when AIDS takes him away, life goes on.
Mehdi is terrified that he is infected, but when he learns that he isn't, his life can resume in new but not altogether different directions.
The story surrounds the succumbing to HIV-AIDS by a life-loving young man at the time when the world was taken by surprise by the ferocity of the hitherto-unknown virus.
It is set in the 80's, when the world first heard about the disease.
It's beautifully shown how these characters deal with it when AIDS hits them and the people they love.
It's only later when Mrs Ashboro suffers a fatal stroke that things start to become strange and ghostly to everyone who knew her.
However, there is one scene in this cartoon that I am surprised got past the censors: at one point when the opponent punches Dan, Dan puts his hand over his face, and it looks as though Dan is shooting his opponent the bird!
2.The girl cycling outside the Jehadi meeting shows how oblivious world remains when dangers like breed in our surroundings.
At first, it all seems harmless when we find out that Saleem has only been sneaking away to meet with his sweetheart Zubeida (played by equally intense Shilpa Shukla) in an abandoned building, their regular meeting spot where they sit and dream about how their lives will be, and do other things just like young people in love do.
The on screen transformations is particularly spectacular, in terms of the way Saleem looks when the film starts (a beautiful young man), to the way he looks when the fanaticism begins to swallow the love he has for his mother and lady love as well as for life as he knew it (a ghost of the boy he used to be) and finally, years later when a chanced glancing at a telly screen leads Zubeida to spot the man she once loved giving a religious speech on a political channel (a mostly unrecognisable Saleem).
It was so heart-wrenching to watch what happened to the women and children when the Muslims came to take over Pakistan, those scenes were very hard to take.
And when Ayeesha/Veero (Kher's character) finally caved into the pressure, it was hard not to shed a tear in disbelief.
Most beautiful being the nawaaz when saleem is sitting on the roof of some sort of fort.
One Sikh man (Navtej Johar) is looking for his elder sister Veero who had gone missing during the Partition in 1947, a time when Sikh, Hindu and Muslim men were killing their own wives, daughters and sisters or were forcing them to kill themselves in order to keep them from being raped by the men of the enemy community as dishonoring the womenfolk of a particular community was seen as the easiest way of dishonoring that community altogether.
Aamir Ali Malik is another actor who plays with the audience, seducing them and disturbing them through the course of the film As an Indian separated from the partition by two generations I can't really say that I feel the pain that my mother does when she sees a film such as this, I have heard stories of my grand aunt who was attacked and mutilated by a mob in Lahore when my mothers family had to leave for India.
But the question that arose in my mind is that those that were around when this bloodshed (on both sides) occurred have mostly died or are dying, will we succeeding generations ever know this pain?
The pain of leaving behind a wife, killing your own daughter, leaving her to be raped, Living in another country when that which was once a part of you lives somewhere else.
How can I fight for this when I don't know what its like?
The expression "This'll put hair/fuzz on your peaches"comes to mind when I think of this film,and it will appeal to a basically select(read:guys,mostly)audience,but that audience should be pleased with a movie like Shoot'em up.
What do you get when the first 5 minutes of a film has a guy kill somebody with a carrot, and proceed to deliver a baby in the middle of a shoot out while constantly dishing out one liners that are nothing short of snappy-as-hell?
Take one scene for example, when Clive Owen's Mr. Smith is having sex with the beautiful Monica Belluci, and right in the middle of it, the bad guys come in.
Especially when you're putting a message about gun control in a movie like this.
But the fact it stars Clive Owen and Paul Giamatti, two of the world's most underrated actors was enough to convince me to check out the film when it was released to DVD.
But before long, the action kicks into overdrive when a pregnant woman walking by is being pursued by a hit-man.
It almost seems a direct parody of the previous year's Children of Men, when Clive Owen had to deliver a baby under similar circumstances.
Like how irked he gets when people don't indicate before changing lanes on the highway.
I also loved the scene when he chastises a mother for smacking her kid.
But when a film is this much fun, who cares how brainless it is!
You know this film is going to be crazy yet delicious when you see a steamy sex scene and a violent shoot out at the exact same time.
Shoot 'em up is quite possibly the best action movie I have seen so far mix in Broads, Bullets, and a Hardcore selection of rock music like Ace of Spades by Motorhead, If You Want Blood by ACDC and Zen by Strapping Young Lad and you have a movie you can put on even when your not really paying attention, just non stop action all the way through such as your typical "Total Recall" or "Crank" films.
Or, when he's in a weapons factory, with Owen elaborately creating a method using strings to develop a labyrinthine maze where baddies carrying machine guns fall prey to gun fire when they turn corners(..even if this is the most ludicrous action sequence ever designed, it's a dream come true for action fans).
With Hertz undaunted despite heavy losses when several operations to kill Smith fail miserably, he will keep coming until our hero can discover why these murderers want such a precious child dead.
I understand something being over the top but when a filmmaker chooses to completely disregard reality, common sense, and psychics it's not only lazy but insulting.
Furthermore, the script is so full of cringe-worthy lines, it's hard to see why writer Michael Davis may have thought he was being clever when writing them.
I am not adverse to films of a mindless nature, believe me I have sat through films such as Deep Blue Sea and Transformers and been thoroughly entertained, they are what they are, however when you have a mindless action film that have bad set pieces terrible dialogue, even worse scripting and woeful special effects all you are left with is Shoot 'em Up.
Just when you're about to take a breather from the action, it revs up again and takes off.
I'm going to see it again with the wife when it gets released in Sept.
Owen plays Mr. Smith -- and that's probably not his real name -- a guy who is simply waiting for a bus when he gets drawn into one of the wildest, most crazy-violent action opening scenes of all time.
The enigmatic coincidence of it all is only part of the film's joy (and when it begins to explain some its elements, that's where it goes wrong).
I rated this movie a 10 in the context of other action movies; it's nowhere near a 10 when compared to classics like Casablanca, but in it's genre, it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do.
"War Stories" was originally intended to be a series, but NBC chickened out when they thought it was "too risky" to make a program about real life issues and make the audience think for more than 2 seconds.
And it gets real difficult for them, when they're influenced by enemy and allies, who all try to get advantage.
Someone once said:" In war and love, anything is allowed" so expect everything, when they pursue their quest for "their truth", because there is no simple truth, except : "any war is dirty, even the clean ones".
Like a lot of people I was kinda bummed by T3, it was an okay film but a FAR cry from the first two so I was psyched for Salvation when I first heard about it, but as each successive trailer was released and the PG-13 locked into place I found myself worried that it would be a let down...  As it turns out its not as bad as I thought it would be, the action sequences are thrilling and gripping, the plot isn't all that bad and there's enough violence to make it R-Rated-ish...
Ex-commander Steiger and three of his army buddies go to Canada for a little duck hunting.Steiger,grieving for his son lost in the Vietnam War, gets ballistic when he finds out that Huffman,who's running the camp,is a deserter.A violent shootout occurs as Steiger and his friends go after Huffman and his girlfriend Mattson with tragic results.
They buy them and try them on when they get home and become able to hear what people are really thinking, i.e.
Each one is different and each one experiences a death because of it (as I remember from seeing this one when I was a child.)
I bought the "50 of the Best" DVD on E-Bay and have watched about 46 of them so far with my wife, but the episode I want - as I suspected when I received the 4 discs - isn't among them.
I understand when it ran originally, and that it was in rerun mode for sometime after that.
This happens throughout the centuries until the present (1959) when the current lord is dying.
I don't remember it being this way when I saw it in the theaters.
Unfortunately (saying that a lot in this review...), considering that the film is about sharks, sharks actually don't feature all that often and when they do it's a bit of a let-down.
There are several contrivances, and truthfully they were rewriting the script as it was being filmed due to Bale's demands, but all in all (and all things considered), this is an enjoyable film that not only is better on second viewing, but manages to ingratiate itself into the library of Terminator franchise films (or will when it's out on DVD in an unrated, extended director's cut edition, that is).
That is to say, he feeds the sharks and protects them against greedy fishermen, and in exchange they don't eat him when he goes for a swim.
He doesn't use his shark-friends to score with the ladies, doesn't say anything witty when he hunts down shark killers and he doesn't even make a joke about how astonishingly fat and tasteless the owner of the striptease bar is!
Mitch Snider, anesthesiologist, and his rich unappreciative family are in for the surprise of their lives when a letter arrives from long lost cousin Woodrow Snider.
Mitch's expectations are far from what he gets when they arrive and find their cousins are hippies with a crazy son and a goth daughter.
i thought it was going to be funny with the previews on TBS, but when I saw the real thing, it was pathetic.
Remember when National Lampoon made good films like "Animal House" and "Vacation"?
A few years ago when I was a bit younger, I used to not mind this show(I'm now 16).
But when I saw it again last month I must say that it was just plain boring and annoying to me.
All of the narratives were recorded all across the U.S when many of the former slaves were very old in age.All of the stories were then put into an anthology on which this film is based.This is indeed a film everyone should watch and learn from.
This sorry excuse for a movie is firing on ALL chambers when it comes to MISSING the mark: *SPOILERS* No shred of a plot with any grounded sense of coherence whatsoever, folks.
But when someone has the audacity to point out the flaws and the bad that occurred in America, by the hands of American leaders and citizens, and all of a sudden they can't handle it.
That is why Americans don't have any problems not "moving on" when it comes to depicting the Nazi regime in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s.
But when it comes to depicting a non-romanticized view of American slavery this country closes its eyes, cuffs its ears and hums really loudly to ignore the facts.
Recently, I have studied for one semester at a university in London and therefor I was very keen to see "Wonderland" when I got back to Germany.
and indeed, when you have ever been to London (or England) for a longer period of time than you will be able to see that story and characters could happen everyday in everybody's life.
A movie cannot take the lazy route and just makes things up when boxed into a corner.
It's hard to concentrate on the many worthy aspects of this film (the naturalistic acting, unvarnished inner London) when trying to keep one's stomach settled.
The hand-held camera thing is getting a little old (at least for me) and when combined with the arty fuzziness and the lousy print (Odeon Victoria) I couldn't enjoy this the way I should have.
Missing this film at the theater, I grabbed the dvd when it was released.
I'm reminded of the film Thank You For Smoking when the character Jeff Mengall spoke of Hollywood plot holes getting filled with lines like "Thank God we invented the... you know, whatever device."
Whereas I can easily sympathise with the symptomatic causes underlying the nonentity of suburban life in gigantic cities, and therefore can easily feel for these people in Winterbottom's very welcome offering in this film, I can so easily again see why, when barely twenty, I took to my heels and left London for other pastures.
Whereas acting is concerned Christian Bale shows up for 35-40 minutes looking real angry at the world and at being involved in this project, it is in fact Sam Worthington who is a breakout star, and such an effortless tough guy that you can feel the bass reverberate in your body when he throws a punch.
This may be the best film of 2000 (at least that's when it was released in Australia).
When I was small mostly all my favorite shows were anime and when I grew up and my anime shows all came to an end I started watching shows with people and forgot about anime until Inuyahsa that is.
I like it when Kagome tells Inuyasha to sit when she gets mad at him.
I swear there were 3 or 4 great ideas put into play by McG, but, when you start an idea, develop it, that just didn't happen, the whole film felt like it was jumping from one thing to another with very little explanation.
Character development, too, slows down greatly and by the later seasons, the cast has become quite unchanging, resulting in increasingly stale jokes (particularly those concerning the monk, who's ironic traits start out as mildly humorous but grow tiresome when the jokes associated with them appear repeatedly).
I was madly in love with it until then.. when I started to just find it all a bit tiresome.
I don't know why, but when I first saw the ads for this show on YTV, I thought that it looked stupid.
How could they possibly win a war against the machines when they can't even kill one in their own home????
And just when I thought the movie couldn't possibly get any worse... it does.
In fact, when i first started to watch it, I quickly became hooked.
Even so, reused animation cells plague most action scenes, and it is very hard to ignore them when it is clear that the exact same boulder has flown past a character five or six times in a row.
Since Lydia was good looking, I was able to care for her character when she became in danger of being killed by Jon.
Devin's explanation that an artist must play God with his audience turns out to be crucial, and even the sheriff's unusual gerbil story has a deeper significance when one opens their mind to the possibilities.
The misgivings continued through the credits when I saw a cast of names that, although recognizable, hardly signal quality in a motion picture.
Following a singular hero around is getting tired, especially when there is such a wide, diverse mix here.
Although the filmmakers' sympathies clearly lie with the prisoners, who are at least presented to us as flawed, three-dimensional human beings, he is not afraid to show the evil side of these men when he needs to as well.
Still, by concentrating so intently on the everyday minutiae of these men's lives in prison, Babenco certainly helps the characters to become more real for the viewer, thereby intensifying the sense of loss when the tragedy occurs.
If anything, this film could be a vivid reminder to law breaking people about what they can expect when they have to pay their debt and must serve time under conditions such as the one we see in Carandiru prison.
I still fail to understand why "Carandiru" was ignored by inane Cannes film festival 2003 jury.Hector Babenco is a great filmmaker and I have still not seen "Pixote".This film provided me a great opportunity to comprehend his style.To my mind it is simply brilliant.When I saw this masterpiece at a cinema housing 1500 people,trust me when I say that I was not alone appreciating its greatness.There was absolute silence and the remaining 1499 people were glued to the movie screen.
The effect of the "slow" hours of the movie finally deliver a very traumatic and powerful result: when the military police stormed the prison towards the end, it is trying not to feel genuine shock and horror.
Is humiliation and slaughter appropriate only when you wear a badge?
This is a true story about the massacre of inmates at the prison when police dealt with a riot.
I saw this film when I was in Brasil a couple of weeks ago (April 2003).
Rodrigo Santoro as muscular Lady Di, the charming and charismatic transsexual in love with tiny and likable Gero Camilo as No Way, who when eventually released wants to become a doctor.
In fact, I fell asleep somewhere in the desert, when the main characters of the movie were burning up their last belongings to provide heat for an already dead child.
The movie portrays this well at times, and it is especially when western helicopters fly above that we get a feel of the contrast of our societies.
And when I actually bothered to look up "McG"s body of work I can't say that I'm surprised.
In the end, we are left with hope, hope that when her young voice does eventually speak out, it speaks loud and clear for all to hear- sounding a message that transcends borders, nationality and religion.
At the moment, when a few helicopters flying over the head of the traveling family and they look up, I realized how deeply drawn I was into the movie and its very sad reality - so out of place seemed this modern technological machine compared to the mule-drawn carriage in a harsh landscape.
In a specific scene, when she finds out her cables have been wrongfully sent, she has the crowds (and folks at home) up in roars.
She was able to convey the intimacy that comes from years of being someones right hand, and then to lose that when you have been sidelined by that very same person.
It was one of the rare occasions when a stage performance of importance was saved on film.
In one scene, when Marion takes him on the Paris metro, he begins tensing up with fear, and starts talking about 9/11.
But then his fear manifests itself, when a creep on the train stares openly and lustfully at Marion.
Although is is clearly a B movie, I have seen it at least three times and recorded it once but have lost the tape and have many times wished I still had it on nights when TV viewing was exceptionally poor.
I have just found this title on ebay and placed a bid for it, which if I win in about 3 hours time, will have cost me a phenomenal Â£10 in a time when used VHS tapes can be picked up for 50p.
I have long been a sci-fi buff but only when the subject is truly believable.
I was in the right place and in the right time when I've seen it.
Mr. Goldberg has some good moments when he is at his nastiest, like with the group of tourists he misdirects in order to get ahead of them in the taxi queue.
The couple wanders Paris, talking in that way that lovers do when they start to get on each other's nerves.
They come across old boyfriends so frequently it makes Paris give Goldberg the impression of a petite village, and when Delpy attacks one of them in a restaurant for taking a vacation to Thailand to do some nasty things that she says in French, Goldberg is fed up, unable to understand.
Except when he has Julie as a vanishing point to fall towards.
Everyday boring events as a movie topic do not necessarily lead to boring movies, at least not when the director manages to present these events in an interesting way.
The cinematography in general is so basic that you will probably agree with me when I say that your 13 year old niece can make a movie like this with a bit of help from her dad.
The scene in the beginning of the movie when Jack gives the group of the Americans tourists the apparently wrong directions to Louver just because he is sure that they are conservative Bush supporters does not make him a white knight, and it is just not funny.
Let's take a few snaps-pots of this film:  - she sends a picture of her naked boyfriend to her family - when asked if she had an affair with the guy at the florist she replies oh no !
I just gave him a blow job - this guy will later in the film describe that it was like sex between sister and brother - her father has a gallery filled with sexually explicit and obscene paintings,he salivates at the name of orgasm, cunnilingus and is ecstatic when saying: sex good - at the party the guy who sits next to the main male character starts stray away to speak about women pubic hair   Please, I am French, I know a lot of French people, I have been to lots of parties in Paris and know a lot of uninhibited people, but the description of French sex obsessed people in this film is grotesquely twisted and exaggerated.
In fact, you'd wonder if honesty (100% no holds barred revelations) can offer you less headache, particularly when your partner has to discover some parts of you that you want hidden away, either for reasons of being ashamed, or just because you want to protect him/her from possible hurt when they find out the truth.
While at first being quite magnanimous, Jack will confront his fears and ego-busting situations when he starts to realize in his own warped perception that Marion may well be the village bicycle, having ridden with/on/by every male they come into contact with.
Until you've been to Paris, it is difficult to realize just how much in love with all things American the (urban) French actually are... until they encounter it face to face, when they find it so baffling that the only recourses are sarcasm and irony, in addition to lapsing into French spoken so fast that even some French speakers find it incomprehensible.
Since it was a slice of life story line, I was not able to anticipate when the movie would end.
However, I accepted the movie's ending when it did happen.
But hold on this one is different.Parker Stevenson gives a sensitive, endearing performance when he first encounters the alien that the military have captured.
My expectations were fairly low when I was coerced into watching Julie Delpy's directorial debut.
The whole way of Neil growing up doesn't seem dramatic... its just the small things hidden behind his acting (like his best friend says he has a black hole where others have a heart) and his distant stare when being hugged.
It is very doubtful anyone can fully grasp the emptiness inside a child's life when searching for a reason behind his cold empty silence.
Yet when dealing with the scars of child abuse, not even the greatest medical or psychological specialist will ever be able to fathom nor even comprehend the severity of the wound.
I don't really get like that when watching movies.
The boys know each other only peripherally, but their lives converge when one of the youths seeks answers that only the other can answer.
Brian eventually begins to feel that he and Neil are somehow more deeply connected, and goes in search of him, only to find that he's moved away - But when Neil comes back over the Christmas holiday, Brian will learn all the answers he needed to know - which may prove far worse than his initial UFO theories...
That said, the themes and scenes are handled tactfully, even when portraying some truly horrifying events.
He'll discover more than he bargained for when he realizes a deep connection with Neil, who he played baseball with nearly ten years ago.
Neil has told Wendy all his private stories about being with Coach, and older man who used to make-love to Neil when he was a little boy.
And here Wendy witnesses teeth marks on Neil's prick when he takes his pants down to show what this john did to him.
But Neil's frozen in time, back in that summer when he was 'special'; his sexuality warped, he is compulsively searching for that same feeling, without realizing that search will destroy him.
Childhood almost becomes like a fantasy, and even when awful things happen to a child, they see it in a child-like way.
Certain topics Â in this case pedophilia Â are very tricky when it comes to an adaptation on screen: it's very easy to go over the top and make something purely shocking; that's probably the biggest challenge, simply trying to portray the story without annihilating the audience.
At the same time, there is a parallel story of another young man, Brian, who can't comprehend the way his life has turned when something happened to him a long time ago without being able to understand, having lost memory of a few hours in a fateful summer day years ago, when the same man abused him.
It only happens once in a blue moon, but when I saw this film, it definitely happened: I realized I was watching a work of art.
Neil (Gordon-Levitt) and Brian's (Corbet) story starts in the early 1980s when they are only eight-years-old.
The story moves forward to when Neil and Brian are at adolescence's conclusion.
The other students start mysteriously disappearing, and when LeStrange gets on board the school, he and another teacher, Janet Playfair, (Suzanna Leigh) take the case to the police, who round up the town and charge after the Karnstein family help up in their castle.
The eerie opening, when an abducted village woman is abducted and taken to the castle, has two vampires slice her throat and the blood drips all over a white shroud the covers a corpse in a coffin.
So I didn't get around to it when I lived in California since it came and went very quickly however the film did show up in a little theater about 5 miles from my house so I figured I have to check this film out and so I did.
Brian can't remember what happened to him when he was younger but he knows something bad happened.
It is the story of two teenage boys who were both sexually abused by the same man when they were younger.
Eventually, Brian tracks him down to find out what happened to him when he was younger.
Amnesia, also, hits Crystal and when she comes knocking on Tom's door, she is so confused that Tom invites her in and vows to find her family.
this kind of disney-like movie is never a bad choice when you are just looking for fun time in viewing.
I have never forgotten it and am still feeling the slowly growing horror it produced back then when I remember it now.
The funniest scene, which my friend and I keep laughing at, is when Barbara Stanwyck is cooking.
I really think that because Billie Joe was drunk, he may not have realized the reality of what was going on when that man raped him(in my opinion it was rape).
But Billy Joe tries anyway and when they finally are allowed to date, an event happens that you did not see coming.
I saw it for the first time when I was 15 in 1976 and I still love to watch it.
Robby Benson is good, although the story itself awkward at times, and at times when the plot is revealed outright embarrassing, with an improbable twist.
One of the final scenes, when she encounters Barksdale on the Tallahatchie Bridge, is quite touching and sad.
Moving in its finality, she is a young woman going out in the world with nothing but a suitcase; when he asks her what she will do she says "somehow I'll manage".
I watched this movie back in 1992 when I was 14 on midnight but I can still remember the scenes and plot vividly.
We have come a long way, but we still have a long way to go when it pertains to normal human sexuality.
The couple, along with their chauffeur, find themselves in the middle of a mystery when they are beset upon by a series of guests.
And that's when things start to get ugly, and I mean UGLY.
Good film, really enjoyed when I watch the DVD over the weekend though one thing did spoil it, vampires walking in the daylight!
However, when I read on the video box that this was a Troma movie, I almost passed on it.
The plot is simple : A group of teens have to repair an old house, but when one of them hits a grave in the backyard, and old lady awakens from death, and one by one, these teens get killed by the old lady.
After a brief prologue showing Ann Leatherbee ("1940's Girl" Leighann Belair) and her mother, Abigail ("Old Lady" Douglas Gibson), nonchalantly sitting/standing over a dead body, we move 40 years into the future, when seven feisty young adults arrive at the same house to fix it up.
Still, when astute readers notice that my rating for a film like this is higher than or the same as my ratings for films like Constantine (2005), Mulholland Drive (2001), Predator (1987), Ichi the Killer (Koroshiya 1, 2001) and Donnie Darko (2001), they (maybe rightly) wonder, "What is going on?
The extended scene when the "kids" first arrive at the house and try to start fixing it is a gem.
Way back when Troma would release anything (okay...they've ALWAYS released anything), this film came out of their vault o'horror with an interesting premise: dudes renovate haunted house, some get possessed by evil spirits, end up trying to kill each other.
I found this movie by happy accident when looking for another title at Video Vault.
The rule in acting is that no accent is necessary when doing a film or a play set in a foreign country.
This is why when actors perform Russian plays, or Hollywood did films set in Nazi Germany, Budapest, Spain or anywhere else, the actors did not have to use an accent of that country.
Villon went so far into obscurity that we do not know when he died after leaving Paris.
It's those Burgundians who have Paris surrounded and are dictating terms to Louis XI when the story opens.
Interesting talking about the King's English when dealing with a pair of figures from medieval France.
You will thrill when you hear Colman rouse that rabble of low degree even if he doesn't sing.
I knew I was in for a treat when I saw Preston Sturges was scriptwriter for this film, which was clever and energetic, but I didn't expect such wonderful performances from both Basil Rathbone (who received an Oscar nomination) and Ronald Colman.
o Bitchy Blonde Girl: Yes, however, the least number of times and the least quality of times when it does happen.
Don't get me wrong as it's far from a masterpiece but believe me you could do a hell of a lot worse than Slaughter Studios when you compare it to the straight-to-video crap that litter video shop shelves these days.
The initial sequence and the scene when Steve tells the story of the 70's murder at the Slaughter Studios is very original.
The internal everyday battle of men to stay faithful to the one they love when their natural animal instincts and testosterone are telling them to try and sleep with every fine piece of arse they see.
I watched this show when I was 19.
All in all I did enjoy it when I was single and when I got into a serious relationship.
I was totally disappointed when this show was cancelled - and hope somewhere down the line it will come around again.
I watched this as a child and thought it was brilliant and watched it when ever it was on.
Just when the Hammer Christopher Lee Dracula franchise began to run out of steam in the late sixties, the company revved up its product by turning to Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla (written before Bram Stoker penned Dracula, by the way, and a big influence on that better known book) and filming several versions of the novel.
Lust is admittedly shaky in terms of script, and the ambiance is on again off again (but wow is it terrific when it's on).
What makes this click with so many horror buffs, in particularly those who love lesbian vampire films, is the one-time star Yvette Stensgard, a gorgeous Scandanavian child-woman who looks absolutely innocent (particularly when her eyes fetchingly cross), even the moment before she rips open the neck of her next victim.
Better known as Frankenstein's monster in "House of Frankenstein" (1944), "House of Dracula" (1945), and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948), Strange plays an over-sized simpleton who doesn't know his own strength and behaves like a coward when he trips over two corpses.
"I was so anxious to get square with you that I busted out," says Cole as he holds Bradford at gunpoint, "I could've knocked you off when I just came in but I had to face the judge when he handed me my rap and I want you to do the same."
There is a hilarious moment when Weatherby argues with a roadblock watchman (Jimmy Aubrey of "Swamp Woman") during the storm about when the bridge to Canada will be rebuilt.
It reminded me so clearly of the classic early Warner Brothers cartoons about the fiends in the old houses on stormy nights and when you watch a movie like this, you can see the influences that inspired the great Chuck Jones.
The four of them lift each other up when they are down and are always willing to lend a hand in each others lives to make it a little bit better.
Joan's behavior was completely rotten towards William when they returned from New York, and she was a bit immature, trying to play games, setting him up with both Monica and the other girl.
She was actually jealous of Toni when Toni was about to get married.
Maya's conduct was similar, especially when she was William's assistant, and even after she was rightly fired.
She always felt she could do what she wanted when she wanted where she wanted.
Her friend also acted like a total jerk towards the father of her own children when he came to pick up the kids.
There are times when this show blatantly rips off elements of Sex and The City.
She does not know if she wants to be with men or women(and she drives them both insane), She is very scatterbrained and when people depend on her she is likely to fail them.
So much so that when he took her to court that I was ecstatic but unfortunately the idiot had to feel sympathy for this loathsome tramp and dropped the case.
I am always anxious to see Black people on the TV screen but when all I'm getting is chittlin circuit trash like Girlfriends, Eve, Cuts, The Game and Half and Half , I begin to lose hope for quality Black shows because every show that was cool like All Of Us is countered by dreck like the shows I just mentioned.
I saw this movie (with my parents) when it first came out.
He also hears that an English teacher is coming and when he arrives Lestrange tricks him into going to Venice for a month and now he can get the job at the school.
One night Mircalla kills her lesbian roommate (Pippa Steele) and then when she finds out that Giles knows about her she kills him also.
I saw this movie on the Big Screen when it came out.
It is doubly so when the characters are talking, and there is a shot of the magnificent Norwegian landscape in the background.
But I am sure that in the final seconds, as Grieg is running up the street to his home and Nina, his arms swinging as one's arms do when running, he passes a young girl traveling in the opposite direction - and his hand smacks her rump sending her sprawling off camera .
I saw this one when I was in high school.
What is very disappointing is that this film had the opportunity to reach the heights of "The Sound of Music" with exceptional music and scenery but it required more ingenuity when it came to writing and direction.
The film is carried a long at a steady pace as the characters and plot evolve until the arrival of uninvited guests when the pace becomes frantic.
Then, by manipulating the height of them, it makes the appearance of a giant picture when they are all seen together.
They love and hate each other, they laugh and cry, they FEEL the way you can feel only when you're 20 and the whole world belongs to you.
But when her father owes a local farmer money, she is sent to teach his illiterate children in order to work off the loan.
Somehow, she turns that into a positive experience - though when you see the beginning scenes of her life there, you won't imagine she ever could.
This may not sound odd at all by today's standards- but the movie takes place in 1897, back when women were treated as if they were objects, with everything decided for them (as the movie clearly illustrates).
Even when she's proposed to by a wealthy man (Frank) and practically offered a life of leisure and prosperity, being the very independent young woman she is, gives up the offer, laughing at the very idea of marrying a man for money and not love.
The gasps heard all over the theater when Sam Neill is first seen (from Sybilla's POV in the tree) also made an indelible impression.
She only idles away with what she feels could so easily be hers and is driven to single- minded desire of it when it comes to be a challenge.
You'll chuckle at the stories she tells on how cast and crew achieved what you see on screen when little or no money was left in the budget.
I hadn't seen this when it was new, and I'm glad.
What's even rarer is when the actress is intelligent and skilled enough to place that higher fold in the center of the filmmaker's intention.
Because it is this sort of translucent folding, we see Cate when we see Judy.
It's just too bad it ends when it does.
In the film an artist is painting a lovely landscape when he finds himself able to step into the picture.
My mother took me to see this film when I was ten, the year before she died.
This is followed by another funny gag, when the last ball comes out lodging into Tom's eye and Jerry draws an eyeball on it.
Another one of the funniest parts is when Tom is trying to locate the ball far off into the distance and Jerry whistles to him after a while only to reveal he had the ball the whole time.
The gag of Tom with the fur like a French Poodle is silly, but the only gag I hate is when Tom gets an explosive reception by the bees under the water.
The visual jokes are all rather amusing but I do feel sorry for Tom when he's victimized in such a way.
Tom the cat is golfing quite horrible, in my humble opinion, and when he finally does manage to miraculously actually get the ball in the hole Jerry the mouse is there to continually pop it out again.
But even when the dialog was clichÃ©d, the actors manages to sell it.
One of the best scenes is when Charlie (Meyers) is watching "A Current Affair" while using a theighmaster!
And Rose, Harriet's strange sister, is funny when she offers to make a wonderful breakfast for Charlie.
The funniest scene is when the father relates his conspiracy theory.
The best lines in this movie are when Myer's and his cop buddy discuss Mrs. X (which should have been the title of the movie; it would have played out better).
But I saw this movie for the first time in years recently, and I thought"These were the days when Mike Myers actually did good stuff".
Things change when Charlie meets Harriet Michaels (Travis) a local butcher who isn't just beautiful but has a heart of gold, their relationship is going great until he suspects Harriet of being Mrs. X a woman who kills her husbands on their wedding night.
His friend Tony (Lapaglia) thinks he's just being paranoid but the story reaches a climax when the real murderer is revealed and tries to kill Charlie.
Among them: every scene involving the hero's cantankerous dad; Harriet's sister Rose persuading Charlie to stay for breakfast; Phil Hartman's cameo as a very intense tour guide at Alcatraz (this scene gets butchered when the movie is edited for TV, even non-premium cable; make sure you see the uncut version!
You can't help but love the part where his Captain comes into his office, kicks his feet off the desk and gets stuck into him for nosing into a case belonging to Homicide, particularly, since when he comes back into the office and tells him how much he loved that outburst.
This is a movie you can watch repeatedly, especially when you've seen everything else in your DVD library, it's fun, not meant to be taken serious, the hero gets the girl (somewhat) and nobody get's hurt except the drunken bagpiper at the wedding reception.
The two begin to date but Charlie begins questioning his relationship when clues pointing to an serial killer show up and point directly to Harriet.
There isn't a lot of plot or heart to chew on with this movie, which accounts for the lot of the reason that this is a short review; but when a film is this funny, who cares what it's about?
That thing squeaks too much when it turns.
It's also the point when I began warming up to the Doggett and Reyes characters.
But when little black girl Carolyn Crawford falls down a well, she's feared to have been kidnapped, and this after having last being seen with a white man in town.
And it's now when the film well and truly makes its point, a point of reference that should be heeded as long as we all shall live.
Yeah, some of it is outdated now but the movie held up as I recall when I've seen it in subsequent years.
The telling moment comes when black and white mobs are about to slug it out with boards and guns and whatever, a child runs up to the leader of the white mob and says, "They found the kid", and he says, "What kid?"
This terrific films studies the make-up of a small town and displays both the town at its ugliest(when the town so easily and realistically descends into a mob) and at its finest(when they discover the little girl's real whereabouts and set out to try and rescue her).
Racial tensions are already at a fever pitch, when a tiny black girl disappears.
Once, when it was first released on TV in the late 50s or early 60s; and a second time, in the early 70s.
The drifter (Harry Morgan), when found, proves to be related to a town big-wheel who, when his construction company is set afire, becomes the chief rabble-rouser.
The story holds attention Â despite a glaring break in the middle, when the focus shifts from racism to rescue.
Apart from being one of the goriest films ever to garner an R rating, REAZIONE A CATENA is also something of a record holder when it comes to alternate titles.
Thus when suspicion shifts from character to character, as is the case with most giallo movies, there enter more characters in the form of a bunch of youngsters branching into more familiar slasher territory.
Also there is also another scene where two people are killed at once by a single spear when they are in bed together.
Bava's tongue was clearly in his cheek when he made this one.
The movie continues on it's gory way that when it's finally over practically everyone in it ends up brutally murdered.
Does Bava continue to ride on the coattails of the genre when its achieving mass popularity?
And, just when you think you have finally got everything just the way you want it, Bava throws in a twist that had me laughing my ass off.
A series of gruesome murders is set in motion, each one more outlandish than the last, to the point where when a simple strangulation takes place late in the film, the viewer is shocked at the restraint.
many years ago on Cable TV â in fact, back when I wasnât yet a Euro-Cult devotee and, consequently, ended up being rather lukewarm on it.
A young couple having sex get sandwiched when the killer decides to place his spade away for a moment using a spear, thrusting it into the male's back through the unfortunate french chick on bottom..the spear kill in Friday the 13th Part 2 pales in comparison.
`Everyone's a killer when money and power are involved', Bava seems to shout out.
Needless to say this movie is light-years ahead of its time when it comes to showing explicit violence and detailed gore.
Bay of Blood is often noted as being an obvious inspiration on the Friday the 13th series, and when taking things such as the setting and a certain murder sequence into account, that is certainly true; but let's not forget that this is also a fantastic movie in its own right.
We watch as a wheelchair-bound baroness is brutally strangled, only for the rug to be torn from under us moments later when her assailant is the next one to bite the bullet!
Throughout the labirynth like story-line, we bounce from one character to the next, never having enough time to get to know the people in the movie to care enough for them and when they are killed, their deaths suddenly take a surprisingly modern twist.
My favorite scene in BOB is the one when Claudine Auger goes to the bathroom.
My personal favorite is a 'small' joke when a midget comes in.
I watched this film with my wife, and I can honestly say that there is something in this film for men and women alike (specially when you watch it together)Âenjoy!
Vince knew what he wanted when he made this movie and it'll leave you wanting more..
I'm big on independent films and when you have a good story, threesomes, billiards how could you not want to see this.
That guy has a familiarity that I could swear I seen him before, but when I looked him up, he wasn't listed in anything.
I was especially impressed when learning that they were able to create this project with a budget of only around $5,000.
The friends left when Mrs.
Regard for her allegedly rose when news of said escapade made the industry rounds.
Actually she was 15yrs old , She only made 1 porn movie at age 18 before FBI arrested her , so all her movies were made when she was underage , Some other pornstars investigated during the early 80's and possibly appeared in porn movies underage include Alexandria Quinn , Kristara Barrington and Ali Moore , These other girls didn't draw as much attention possibly due to the fact they weren't very popular or overly attractive , at least one of the pornstars appears alongside Traci Lords in more than one movie , There is one movie were possibly all of the actors appear making nearly the entire female cast underage at the time the movie was filmed.
I'm guessing there were various budget problems, especially evident in the climactic battle, where fake sound effects and smoke cover up a lot of bogus action, such as the lack of even real-looking guns - it calls to mind those times when kids use plastic guns and pretend bullets are being fired, falling over unconvincingly.
Admittedly, there are a few instances the when the acting isn't Academy Award caliber, but on the whole this was very good entertainment.
This movie was one of the best straight to video's All in all the acting wasn't that bad It has Kinda Known Actor's And Noreaga a Known Rapper The Storyline Is what keeps you into it.Six Convicts Find A Gold Medallion in the sand out in the desert.The Come Across Danny Trejo Who Gives them A Choice to Either Go Find The Gold Or To The Mexican Border To Freedom,Of Course They Try To Go For The Gold And Thats when the fun starts.The Chicks in the movie are hot The Death's Are Awesome What more is there to ask for in a horror movie Don't Be Fooled by the 1.8 Rating IMDb is giving it If you see this on a shelf at Blockbuster Pick it up and give it a watch for yourself,
I loved this movie when I first saw it and I have enjoyed watching it again and again.
I watched it, and knew I had to rent it, because when the commercials came on I just wanted to be able to see it in its entirety without the ads.
Mostly he keeps to himself till one day when he is pressured into tracking some convicts down.
Dances with Wolves (1990), Thunderheart (1992), and Last of the Dogmen (1995), are all movies that made me proud to have been "captured" by the native American spirit when I was born in 1957.
Rapper NORE plays a decent part as a convict, who looses his head when chased him down off horseback with a cavalry saber!
Opens a little slow, but picks up momentum when the convicts get to town, with some good chase scenes and stylized fight scenes choreographed by Hong Kong action director Tony Hueng.
That should tell you what kind of movies I like, so when I tell you that my eyes watered up at least four times during this film please don't think of me as wimpy.
So later when, Tom stumbles upon a stockpile of personal items and I.d.
's and some (Lumberjack) dynamite, of persons lost or abducted over the years by the lost tribe (in an effort to protect their way of life) there is nothing phony about it when Tom uses the dynamite to collapse a cave leading to the hidden valley where the Indian's live.
I also had a reminiscent thoughts of "Last of the Mohican's (Daniel Day Lewis) while watching this film, up until the point when I realize that this lost Indian tribe was more civilized than the law enforcement agency of the local town.
I am not kidding, even the dog had enough sense to know when he had it good.
That's when I get the itch to feel my horse moving under me while riding through the thick forest.
It's such a shame it wasn't given proper presentation when it was first released theatrically.
It was a smash hit when it was first released, and the film even managed to win the Oscar for Best Picture.
Lots of things are happening in Grand Hotel when several different persons with different motivations check into the hotel.
But it is the stars as a group glowing brighter than ever in a time to quote Norma Desmond when pictures were still big, the players larger than life.
Perhaps Garbo hadn't yet moved on from the silent era, communicating her emotions with thick brush-strokes, but when your face can so dazzlingly light up the movie screen, there's no hurry.
(Watch him in "You Can't Take It With You," for instance, when he had to work on crutches because of his advancing arthritis.
Yes, when Crawford and Lionel Barrymore are on screen.
Although Garbo was a great star in the silent era, she quickly adapted to the new demands of sound in such films as ANNA Christie--but when faced with Barrymore's over-the-top performance she responds in kind, and the result is visually beautifully but incredibly mannered, and their scenes are not greatly aided by their dialogue, which is itself very much in "the grand manner."
Perhaps Pauline Kael put it best when she wrote, "If you want to see what screen glamour used to be, and what originally 'stars' were, this is perhaps the best example of all time."
Perhaps the most impressive performance of all is Lionel Barrymore's: as a bumbling, overly anxious everyman who has been ignored his entire life, he is completely and utterly heart-breaking; there is not a single moment when he isn't in character (and the same goes for the rest of the cast).
Goulding's direction is nothing short of spectacular: his innovative use of close-ups and repeated set-ups is something to be admired -- especially at a time when there was no precedent for these methods.
GRAND HOTEL had been a major Broadway stage success when it was acquired by MGM.
She meets Baron von Geigern (John Barrymore) a hotel thief who inadvertently is in her room (having been in the process of stealing some jewelry) when she is about to commit suicide, and stays the night with her, convincing her not to end things.
And who here today actually knows for certain how an aging Russian ballerina would act out when alone in her hotel room or with her entourage?
I will only mention one scene specifically: when she futilely attempts to telephone her lover, the Baron, in the middle of the night.
Then she capriciously takes on with the Baron von Geigern (a dashing yet shady John Barrymore) who is more interested in her jewels but tells her he could love her; he out-acts her at every turn with subtlety and genuine charm even when his part seems underwritten.
The characters are more or less archetypes and are predicted to act in a certain way, and when their fates collide, it's (now) not a surprise.
A meek little man, he's got courage enough now, courage that comes when you have absolutely nothing to lose.
Anyway check the movie out when you have the chance to.
A shame this is so bad really, because I like bad horror movies and actually rather liked the basic premise: Back when the Spanish were being generally unpleasant to natives in America, they enslaved the local populace and got them to mine all the gold out of the mountains and basically ended up with a wet dream's worth of gold.
They bimble across the desert looking for the Mexican border, finding en route a mummified body buried in a dry river bed with a gold medallion on it; when they later find a mysterious Indian (the always reliable, although poorly cast in this case Danny Trejo) who spots the medallion, he tells them the legend.
Now when they got to where the gold was buried, there was a wild west style town there, complete with an evil sheriff (Billy Drago!
The convicts are enjoying the bar when the inhabitants turn into undead (terrible effects, ghouls look just like normal people, just with some blue eyeliner, right?)
The weird thing is that since things went belly-up in the cat house when the ghouls revealed what they were, the entire population of the town apart from the Sheriff has vanished.
So hey, pick this one up off ebay for the chases, and watch with the volume turned off when you can to avoid the painful dialogue.
Made in the early 80's when the 70's car chase genre was winding down, chockablock with copious footage lifted from such previous Roger Corman-backed drive-in flicks as "Grand Theft Auto," "Moving Violation," "Eat My Dust!," and "Thunder and Lightening," coasting on the faintest sliver of a one-note story, and, just like the numerous car chases showcased herein, running around in endless circles with no particular purpose or destination in mind, this energetically stupid comedic romp was harshly panned by critics and generally dismissed as an absolute turkey.
A few comments- First of all, I was student body president at Antelope Valley College when this movie filmed there-they got to film because they kicked $750 into the student government accounts and loaned us original prints of three films for an on-campus showing (they came back to re- shoot two scenes on a weekend, and snuck onto the football field by conning a security guard, btw)...I'm also a background extra in three different scenes in the first 10 minutes, and several of my friends are also in this movie.
Gale Ann Hurd produced this when she was young and foolish.
Instead, the film has a lot of random scenes that don't make much sense and even when the finale comes, still does not make any sense.
It may be useful to explain my frame of mind when I saw this movie....
Hello every body........... this film is wonderful it is a fantastic film, personally when i saw this film in cinema i hardly stopped my self from laughing, and for the one who said that it is not a good film i want to tell him that the Arabic or Egyptian comedy films cannot be understood or it didn't make them laugh but for the Arabic people it is very perfect.
One scene is particularly funny, the one of the check point when Adel Imam met Talaat Zakaria.
Another scene where Adel Imam showed his real talent was when he fell on the ground in reaction to the heart attack.
Fast forward to present day which has 6 convicts escaping when their transport crashes in the same aforementioned desert.
That point being when all the illogical nonsense going on got so high that I didn't know what the hell was going on, much less cared.
Now when it comes to the Friday the 13th movies you don't expect much especially with all the really awful sequels.
But when it comes down to it, the removal of Jason's body (I suppose that's how you'd say it), this movie is yanked out of the series and doesn't seem to fit very well with the rest (much like "Jason X").
Big dude isn't so tough when faced with high powered weaponry, is he?
Reasons Jason Goes to Hell is the worst in a pretty good series of slasher films:  1) Jason is not scary when he's on "American Casefiles" (I think that's what the "America's Most Wanted"-like TV show was called.
team member would pause for a shower when trying to draw a serial killer into a trap) and blown to bits.
now, the mortician has the power and mind of jason, but it wears on him, like in stephen king's "desperation" and "the regulators" (as richard bachman), so he has to pass on the heart when the body starts to wear, and then somebody else is jason.
I was really anxious when i was going to watch is buy the first time, it really surprised me with things the others movie didn't have like Jason going body by body.
The part i really enjoyed was when Jason got into the police station and defeated all the cops, then when he got into the restaurant and everybody was shooting him.
Maybe I'm being a touch harsh on it as I've seen far worse but I'm fed up of wasting my time with crap like this, having said that I'll still be stupid enough to be the first in the queue when the next low budget piece of crap gets released.
The only thing I find stupid ( and it's not even that big a deal) is that you can only see Jason in front of a mirror that kinda bugged me but then at the end when he is reborn it gets much better.
For example, when a cop asks where Steven is, the girls answers "He's in front of the MYERS' house!"
Also, the Necronomicon lies in Jason's basement and when he finally dies, his hockey-mask is grabbed away by the hand of Freddy Krueger himself.
I was so excited when the beginning of this film was before my eyes.
And why did they start off so well and then just kill us when Jason dies?
And to be honest, when I found out that New Line had decided to produce the films instead of Paramount, I knew that some how, some way, there would be some Freddy reference in it.
Were we all dreaming when we watched him get melted down to goo in the sewers of New York City?
The failure of this film (and "Jason X" years later) shows that fans want a return to simpler times when horny teens in cabins were afraid to look out their windows.
For some reason, when I look to my JC collection for something to watch, I tend toward the older fare.
But all ends well when the black pirate survives and saves the day and his princess, who he asks to marry him.
Another occurs at the end of the film when Fairbanks and The Princess (Billie Dove) declare their love and announce their wedding.
One scene I found amusing, was when the pirates drew lots for the monkey.
And, finally, the plot is pretty good for a silent film--not the most complex when compared to later films, it's not nearly as simplistic as most other silents.
But his plans for revenge become more complicated when he meets his first captive - a beautiful Spanish princess.
It is instead about a love story between two elderly people, Wendell and Fanny, who embark on a new adventure when at the ripe old age of 60, Wendell gets a major new job in his chosen profession.
In 1902 Holmes was three years into the job of Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court when he got the call which insurance actuarists would have given him a decade tops on his new job.
The Holmeses had no children, they did in fact raise a niece who was out of the picture when they moved to the capital, but the legend about his law clerks from Harvard becoming surrogate sons is quite true.
Holmes is 61 years old when the film begins!
We get a few glimpses of Holmes' rulings on free speech issues, and his willingness to restrict free speech when it may present a clear and present danger to the public good.
What sets this film apart from other recent releases that have incorporated hardcore footage as part of their narrative (like the astonishing BAISE-MOI or Lars Von Trier's THE IDIOTS) is that here there is actual warmth and sensuality to the copulation sequences, even when the protagonists are beating the feces out of each other, making it much harder one presumes for moralists to condemn on grounds of lacking humanity or compassion.
Jang initially explores the idea that J is the one that in control of the situation, then hauntingly, the reversal happens when J becomes obsessed with Y.
It becomes apparently clear near the end when J cannot live with Y, as their meetings become less frequent, and J attempts to become a part of normal society.
The obvious pitfalls of this film can be seen by the last scene of this film when we are privy to how the title of this film was conceived.
Did IMDB mess up or was the actress really 15 when the film was shot.
But when the beatings bordered on mutual self destruction, I immediately saw this as lampooning our society's need for ever increasing "kicks" to satisfy our insatiable lust for ever increasing degradation of the human body.
Andy is going to leave 'Bingo' when she shoots him in the shoulder.
This movie was made in 1929, when silent films were fading fast and the Hollywood studios were scrambling to prove that their stars could not only talk but even sing.
In her first "talky," Crawford plays Bingo, a girl brought up in South America who inherits three million dollars when her dad dies.
Since both Crawford and Montgomery were very young when the film was made, it is a joy to watch.
The theme song from the film, "Chant of the Jungle" (sung by Joan Crawford in the film) was a hit in 1929, when the film was made, and you'll be sure to get it stuck in your head even after the movie is over.
Some old friends of the family escort her to New York where she is to live in luxury, but they are startled when she abruptly falls in love with Robert Montgomery.
There are some striking, disturbing visuals, like when Moore does some kinky posing with mannequins for a photographer.
SO when I saw the title and the description on my cable system, I had to watch.
The first thing that is somewhat dolorous in Dead Heist is that the zombies are nicely introduced while rolling the front credits, but then forgotten for about an hour Â and when they are brought back you'd wish the wait would have been worth it.
That is because Anghus Houvouras (the writer) seems to fancy himself imaginative when he makes them a hybrid from the "fast dead" (as seen in 28 Days Later) and vampires (they drink blood).
All this of course wouldn't have troubled the seasoned b-grade movie-fan if not for the total swizz the zombies turn out to be when they finally make their appearance.
Not only did they get astonishing numbers of bad extras for the zombies (many stumble around like straw-puppets not sure what to do), they are also totally not frightening and not able to kill four people who are armed with knifes when coming at them at a 25:1 ratio.
All in all an underwhelming gangster flick, but a total washout when it comes to being zombie horror.
A bank heist goes horribly bad when (what else) the dead come in for food.
That's not saying much, especially when you consider the fact that "Hood" and "Gangs" are bad movies too.
This is when reality shows started to take off.
My room mate and I have taped the series' off Trouble, and not a week goes by when we don't watch it.
However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred.
One can only hope that this kind of thing does not reappear when the next lucky, totally over rated boy band member attempts the same thing.
The thing that really makes this film annoying is, of course that William's' voice is not up to scratch, some would argue the man sounds bad enough when he churns out his usual brand of soulless pop rubbish, let alone try and match the vocal talents of the the original artist.
I've been a Robbie fan since the beginning, even when he was with take that, he was born to be a entertainer, he's got the talent from his dad, who's a well-known comedian in england.Robbie's comedic talent, his gestures, his voice, the whole charisma, has made him to what he is now: THE mega star!
What were the members of the Motion Picture Academy thinking when James Cagney was not nominated for his outstanding performance as Lon Chaney in 1957's "Man of A Thousand Faces."?
Cleva was 17 years old when Lon Jr was born.Chaney and his first wife Cleva had trouble finding work and were forced to travel the country with various theater groups searching for a job.
Lonchaney.com's bio claims Lon Jr would steal sandwiches and money when the audience was not looking.The whole plot about Chaney having conflicts with his wife is silly.
The Soundtrack is horrible as well,the music that plays when Chaney's mute parents are on screen is subtle racism to the deaf in my book.
Chaney died at age 47,Cagney was all ready 57 years old when he began making the film.If you do the math the movie begins in 1905 when Chaney was 24 years old.We can't expect historical accuracy with every movie but as a fan of Chaney I felt insulted watching this piece of crap.You know Lon Chaney would suffer for his art,we need more people like him and less people who want to milk a story for a dollar
I suggest you pass this movie or when you're really a genre-lover, wait until you get it almost for free.
Saw this on the late show when I was 12 or 13: I was moved, even scared, by scenes with Miracle Man, Christmas dinner, Quasimodo, & especially with the legless man in the alley ("Pick me up & knock me down again!")
Happened upon this on AMC one morning when home sick with a cold.
These are not the roles or behavior one expects when tuning in one of his movies.
I love Binoche very much and since she doesn't exactly make six movies a year, I'm glad when I can see her at all.
Instead of that you assist, when watching the movie, to the burial of the careers of Jean Reno and Juliette Binoche.
I got the distinct impression she had never been present when a woman had ever climaxed.
The film asks us to believe that because he loans her his phone and tries to pass on a message, then meets her unpleasant boyfriend, he will offer to share his hotel room when their flights are cancelled due to a strike and that they will both begin to open up emotionally.
You know you're in trouble when a song starts in the middle of a movie and the story stops developing for a while: They do so here because they want to stay faithful to the romcom genre and DÃ©calage horaire / Jet Lag is a French take on a distinct American genre.
Although DÃ©calage Horaire is definitely quirky, it is not desperately quirky (AmÃ©lie) except maybe when it comes to Reno's character FÃ©lix who, quite frankly, seems to be a genuinely disturbed obsessive compulsive.
Binoche does not appear often in the comedies and Reno is not well known as a romantic lead but they were pleasure to watch in the light romantic dramedy that takes place in the famous Paris Charles de Gaulle airport one long rainy night when all flights were grounded by weather and a baggage strike.
Two strangers meet by chance, when Rose (Binoche) who had accidentally flushed her cell phone in a toilet, asks a perfect stranger, Felix (Reno), to use his phone.
Felix learns that Rose is perhaps running away from her abusive boyfriend, Sergio, and is startled when the arrogant flame actually comes to the airport for an encounter with Rose, which goes badly.
The manic action that takes place when they try to first turn Albert straight, then as a woman carries the movie.
What I liked best was that unhollywoodish feeling when the movie don't try to tell me "they love one another very much" for 10 heavy minutes, or "it's really sweet that they meet again" for another 10 minutes, they just flash 10-20 seconds of nicely shot moments which is just enough for a moviegoer with above minimal intelligence to get the point.
I liked the acting as well, I almost smell the lack of comfort when Felix meet the girl from time to time, and lots of closeups made me always feel that these persons are in fact real, and not acting on an average story thread.
It was not surprising therefore than when she turned to directing she did so with her own screenplay La Buche which centered on three sisters and their disparate lives but also offered strong roles to four semi-leads with a handful of cameos (Isabelle Carre's neurotic wife, for example) for good measure.
However when a strike and fog halt all flights in Charles de Gaulle the two meet cute and end up spending the evening together.
It's pretty explicit, it seems to me, when we start with a reference to Pretty Woman and end with the theme from Midnight Cowboy.
What makes this movie stay with me is that the Jean Reno character is not only an inspired chef, he is all sensuality when he eats.
Two parts which stand out are when Felix assumes Rose is a prostitute and when she discusses her make-up routine with him.
Remember the veranda scene when Maine tells Lester that she now owns the world as they look out over the city lights below?
Second, that pride and ego can destroy love when one person can't humble himself and struggle to rise above his failings for himself and that love.
Julliet Binochet, almost unrecognizable during the first half of the film because she is buried under makeup and an odd hair style, is totally delightful and stunning, especially when she finally appears with no makeup and wet hair.
The movie tells the story of Snapphanarna in SkÃ¥ne (the southest "state" of Sweden") and the war between Sweden and Denmark during the 17 th century when SkÃ¥ne became a part of Sweden instead of Denmark.
This movie puts my priorities to shame when you see what atrocities the Swedish army condoned to get the job done, the job being showing the farmers of SkÃ¥ne what would happen if they supported the Danish army and the Swedes would win the war war.
MÃ¥rlind/Stein already prove themselves as a couple of genuine pioneers for Swedish film when they created their previous film 'Storm'.
But there's no need to make a historical correct film, when you're trying to tell a spectacular story about the war between Denmark and Sweden.
It's always easier for me to forgive a movie when it aims for the stars and fail.
I just wonder when Swedish TV and film-makers will understand that a good and solid script is the base in every good movie.
This is a poor series when it comes to the script.
The characters are just repeating themselves and talking about what to do instead of actually doing it (but perhaps that's pretty accurate when it comes to portraying swedes?).
I do NOT want Sweden to go down the road of "nevermind historical correctness, just give the audience a story" when it comes to movies based on actual historic events or periods of time.
Sad when the topic is important.
But of course, when MÃ¥ns and BjÃ¶rn do something it's done for the public and not just the critics.
This sluggish film was more entertaining in the beginning, as an action film, than later, when it became a poorly-executed tale of family redemption, ghosts and secrets from the past.
Then when I find out the movie turns out to suck.
I certainly don't have high expectations when I watch a "B" movie, but I hoped to be entertained.
His companion gets mad when he finds out that he is a son of a murderer and prisoner so after one of the most tedious and hideously acted monologues ever, he starts a fight with the Jack (the hero).
And that's when it struck me: this is one of the worst movies I've seen.
this is the first version of this movie made,and the only version i have seen so far.i liked it.i thought it was touching and ironic,and also tragic.it basically tells what the movie business can do to you,and the sacrifices that are made.it also shows how disposable the industry and the people in it are.as long as you are the flavour of the week,everything seems fine.but when you're no longer useful,reality hits and things can come crashing down.that's what basically happens in this story.it's an indictment(ironically)of the movie industry,however subtle.regardless,i thought it was well done.the acting by the tow leads,Janet Gaynor,and Frederic March,as well as the supporting performances,are terrific.i also thought the writing was very good,and the movie flows very well.for me,A Star is Born gets an 8/10
This movie when i saw it kept me into it the whole way through.
Rugged Federal marshal Lou Diamond Phillips, feisty lady cop Lori Petty, antsy mob informant Steven Williams (the tough, determined bounty hunter out to bag Jason Vorhees in "Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"), and several expendable fuzz who include Dale Midkiff (the dumbbell doctor dad in "Pet Semetery") and Alex McArthur (the chillingly emotionless serial killer in William Friedkin's "Rampage") encounter the fiendish undead felons when they make the unsound decision to use the titular condemned, closed-off highway as a shortcut.
The film has some kind of weird choppy slow motion style when the zombies appear.
But, when they take a shortcut called Route 666, they encounter killers and four zombies.
Although these aren't the most exciting shoot-out scenes ever filmed, they have a nice feel to them, partially due to the setting and lighting, and there is a pleasantly unusual tangent when Phillips has a bizarre "flashback" as he looks at a victim's blood spreading on the dirt.
There is an eerie atmosphere to the whole film, and especially when the horror material starts, it is very refreshing that Wesley chose to keep the proceedings in broad daylight.
But most horror fans probably will not expect a masterpiece when watching Route 666.
After a misunderstanding involving a bomb, they are forced to take their exams supervised by the police, so they manage to cheat using some really weird tricks, like elastic coats that, when stretched, reveal the answers.
For instance, when an officer finds the bomb, as soon as he shouts "I've found it!"
This was a huge hit in Japan when I was growing up... Japanese titled "The Cunning: IQ=0".
We were laughing all the way to the end of the function and some even applauded when it was over.
I saw this movie back in Hungary, when I myself was also in high school, and absolutely loved it.
Esther Blodgett (Janet Gaynor) wants to be a star.She goes to Hollywood to find her way into the pictures.There she meets the big star Norman Maine (Fredric March) and soon the big Hollywood romance is blooming.Esther finds herself in the same movie with her sweetheart and soon there will be more.Her Hollywood name is Vicki Lester.Norman Maine is a troubled star.He drinks too much but she makes him stop.But fighting against alcohol is much harder when he finds his wife a bigger star than he is.William A. Wellman's A Star Is Born (1937) is perfect drama.It touches you the way it should.You really feel for Norman Maine when he loses what he once had.Fredric March does a brilliant job portraying him.The true star Janet Gaynor is wonderful in the role of Mrs.Norman Maine.Adolphe Menjou gives a great performance as Oliver Niles.Andy Devine is in a really sympathetic role as Danny McGuire.May Robson is fantastic as Grandmother Lettie.This movie from 70 years back does very good job showing the downside of fame.A Star Is Born is ageless.
Agar's love interest is killed when she decides to run under a large stone pillar that is falling.
*SPOILERS*  Pompous Agar and Ward and The Load go down in a hole and get trapped when a guy gets hit in the head by falling rock.
But it made quite an impression on me when I first saw it in the theater back in the mid-50s.
I group of scientists are exploring when they stumble upon a huge crack that leads to underground caverns.
They beat the poor mole-like things and when the scientist complain, the ancient dudes attack.
Unfortunately, the latter stages Â when the surviving members of the group (including likable hero John Agar, a regular of Universal sci-fi outings) come face to face with an underground race of albinos and their mutant 'mole' slaves!
The thing is that the plot does have philosophical/existential interest: the species concerned had somehow survived the Biblical flood and, due to a constant lack of sunlight, have degenerated to their current 'form' (with the notion that above them, there's only Heaven Â hence, when the 'normal' humans appear, they're mistaken for Gods!).
They find an old stone tablet that tells of a lost Sumerian dynasty, then it gets destroyed when they leave the five thousand year old artifact on a cheap folding table during an earthquake.
They believed Agar when he told them he was a messenger from the Gods, after all.
I saw The Mole People when it first came out.
MP haunted me as a kid and I have always loved those rare times when it was shown on late-night TV.
it,s a lot better than I thought it was going to be.It stands up pretty good when compared to other 50,s shockers like "Tarantula" .
The poacher boss laughs; when did they become Ritai's property?
Some of what he finds along the way seems contradictory to what he originally felt the patrol stood for: occasionally they sold the pelts they confiscate to get money for their provisions when they don't have enough money themselves(or if one of their number gets shot by a poacher).
The landscape will take your breath away just as quickly as it did for the patrolmen when they began to get bloody noses from the high altitudes.
One is the aforementioned dialog between Ritai and Ga Yu, when Lu Chuan makes his thematic points an hour into the movie.
Another occurs when one of the patrols sinks - and is engulfed - by a quagmire of quicksand.
The last and most shocking comes at the end when the chief is shot for trying to apprehend the poachers.
No matter what the scene, be it a closeup of an action taking place in a river or a medium shot of vehicles traversing a barren, empty land, Kekexili is undoubtedly the main character in this gorgeous but bleak film, a hostile land that in one of the movie's most striking moments, swallows a lone patrolman whole when he makes the mistake of stepping over quicksand.
It gets quickly established from the get-go that these poachers are soulless individuals whose greed has led them to destroy the wildlife, which makes the plight of Ri Tai, a man whose life has been committed to the cause of the antelope, and Ga Yu, a reporter who gets involved in the case, more relevant even when everyone else gets blurred in the background and it seems that there will be no solution to this matter.
KEKEXILI is a tricky movie to classify even when it's clearly grounded in thriller and action roots due to the overpowering nature of the place where it's set and its refusal to romanticize its two lead characters.
They were at great disadvantage when facing well equipped, out numbered and brutal poachers.
The only film which I'd consider Unintentional Horror is this it because I may explain the plot is about Lies and deception -- it's all in the family when a man must convince his future in-laws that he's as uptight as they are.
But their pastel tranquility is shaken when Armand's son announces that he's getting married to the daughter of ultra-conservative Senator Keeley .
He was returning from the filming location in western China when he was killed in a vehicle accident.
There are some vaguely entertaining surreal parts, when the main character encounters the aliens (both of which look like cheap X-Com rejects), but the whole fun of the surreality is that a willing viewer can briefly pretend he is not watching "Communion" and is instead enjoying an ugly acid flashback.
The suspense is horribly managed, the acting is terrible, the film has little direction, and when that 103rd minute finally rolls by, the audience is left with nothing more than the back of the box will tell them.
I rented this one again after having remembered enjoying it when I was a kid.
A Star is Born has had two remakes since this 1937 version, but when this film is discussed this is usually the version that stands out.
I first remember when I was a little kid being in Mann's video store in Bridge City, Texas and seeing the VHS cover of Communion and seeing the alien face really scared me.
I tried to watch it when I was 24, and as I was watching a very scary scene, my body began to experience the "fight or flight" system.
If you were to walk into a room where this was on TV, and up to the part when we meet the 'little blue doctors' and their slightly taller, skinnier red-skinned cousins, you might think you were watching an Ed Wood flick, or something from that decade.
Communion has much potential, but sadly it ends up being one of those films that you are glad when it is over.
I saw this movie when I was a kid.
His drinking habit will get the best of him at a time when help agencies such as A.A. didn't exist.
The film does make you think about all angles of the situation, especially when you consider the point of views and personalities of the people at the abduction support group that Walken's character goes to, and his reaction to it.
Matters get worse when extremely contrived circumstances make Sir Alan a suspect in a new murder.
A man died and he was nearly beaten to death and he still hasn't learned his lesson, and to top it all off he now has a hallucination sequence in a cornfield when he returns home.
Even Flip Dog's racist dad was believable, I cracked up on the part when he said "So now you're a n!gger?"
Their fantasy world of living the thug life comes crashing down when they take a trip to Chicago.
Of course, that might have made the movie more enjoyable, much like when Flip gets beat up.
It is not just a sterotype when cops are racist or when The movie is so real each character could easily be a real person.
It is not just a sterotype when cops are racist or when The movie is so real each character could easily be a real person.
I believe it was the pilot when they ran into pirates.
He was from the future but I don't remember from when exactly.
Pay attention to his eyes, his hands, his face and his moves, especially when he interrupts his wife thanking everybody for the Oscar she got and claims he deserves three statues for the worse performances.
I was enthralled with the programme with the first episode when they went into that strange storm.
The acting isn't great, but you cant afford top actors when you have no money, the actors conveyed the story well enough to be watched.
This is a super-hit movie of horror genre with Superstar Rajesh Khanna in the lead.The song Sang mere nikle and other songs of the film became a big hit.Danny had once sang a Nepali folk song which when telecast in TV, R D Burman had heard casually and remembered this tune so that he could use it in Danny's own production and based on that tune he made beginning tune of Sang mere.This film is rarely telecast in TV channels.Rajesh Khanna's movies were not doing well between 1976-79 with 12 movies flopping of which 4 were classics and had only 3 super-hits during the period.He bounced back with box office hits Amardeep,Aanchal,Kudrat,Dard,Thodisi Bewafaii and unsuccessful Redrose.Phir Wohi Raat is a super-hit film which came after he regained his box office rating after which he had a good phase till 1991 as a main lead hero.
Earlier in the day I was contemplating suicide, but when I flipped to the Sci-Fi channel and started watching Glass Trap I remembered how great life really is.
and when the ""SWAT"" team arrives, a full 4-5 people command line arrives to the place where the ants are bugging people, they simply comes up with the idea to Blow the skyscrape up... Like if 4 people had that power to do so.. Don't go see this movie, unless you are 90+ years of age and haven't seen a film in 50 years.
* Why did Carley not call the cops when she first saw the ants?
Or even use the phone when she and the security guard were trapped together?
But where road side bombs and ambushes have been erased, Richard is psychologically stuck with constant explosions going off in his mind Â anger, rage, sadness and that lust for revenge when he learns his younger, more simple brother has suffered torment and bullying at the hands of the local drug dealers and young adults who have not matured enough to shake off that 'chav' mentality.
Further utilisation of the kid follows; then it gets more serious when drugs and women come into play.
Meadows also gets across the element of humour early on in his film; indeed, when you see Herbie (Wolfenden) trundle down the road in his Citroen 2CV with the other guys in the back, you cannot help but smirk at how real this all feels; at how these people are presented as people who live, breath, hang around in apartments and drive obscure cars.
Things get really bizarre when a SWAT team is called in to blow up the over-sized bugs.
The film got even better, when they showed a gory picked-to-the-bone skeleton.
But my anticipation shrank when the first shot of the menacing critters flashed to my television screen.
She was in the FBI but made a career change because she faints when seeing a corpse.. not kidding.
- the lights go out.. so do the elevators which doesn't stop the janitor for trying to use them..and why should he, the company info stealing guy also used the elevators when the lights where flickering.. gets stuck and attacked by a plastic non moving ant.
* reread the above sentence and ponder about it for a moment*   The moronic janitor with a past, the bitchy editor and the assistant try to make it to the roof ( reason: - as explained by the janitor "those ants see this as an ant farm so they will dwell on the lower levels.. we need to make it to the roof" My mouth fell open when hearing this.
And there is a revelation: the fainting when seeing a dead body female agent is a member of a secret department of agriculture that is so secret even the president doesn't know about it and she is following a lead that has a terrorist ship that had plutonium aboard.
My favorite part was when someone BURNS A CD on $30 DVD player that they pretend is part of a computer.
The female character is afraid to meet in private despite the urgings of her male lover and when she does make the leap, the consequences will forever change the relationship.
We don't know why Richard is so obsessed with taking harsh revenge and it slowly unfolds towards the end when some of the thugs already were taken down.
It starts slowly with Richard stalking some of the thugs, painting their leader a clown face in his sleep... but in one of the strongest sequences of the film when Richard is talking to the thugs about why he stalks them you can feel something bad is going to happen.
He is set to spend the weekend with a Swedish girl, a cousin of a friend, but, when he runs into a beautiful, young, and married girl outside of the Picasso Museum, he has to run after her.
Conversely, we have the awful 70s hair, very fluffy and with the big bump in the back that was so much in Vogue, and even the mysterious woman in the attic has on heavy eye makeup when we see her.
It is a relief to see the story less amputated than is necessary when confining it to a two-hour presentation.
I can't believe I was so young when I saw it, because it made such a deep impression on me and I understood it so clearly, even at a young age.
However, when we get to the interaction between Jane and Rochester, it comes alive and I forgot the datedness of the production.
Best romantic scene is when Rochester thanks Jane for saving him from the bedroom fire - as Rochester holds onto Jane's hands, the glances they exchange and when Rochester says 'Jane' after a silent pause as she walks out of his room - speaks volumes.
My dad made a recording of it when it was on Masterpeice Theater on KQED a long time ago, but the tape is very bad now.
I was just a lad of ten when I saw this 1973 BBC production of "Jane Eyre" for the first time.
well, since goodness knows when.
Why, when mentions are made of productions of 'Jane Eyre', is this production never mentioned?
I saw it when I was 11 years old, and fell desperately in love with Rochester (Michael Jayston).
I watched this when they first showed the series on TV.
The long dialogues between Rochester and Jane are a joy to read, but when they are transferred to the screen in nearly their full length as in this production, their complexity and very unusualness create an impression of artificiality and staginess.
The language is carefully preserved, and when spoken by the excellent actors Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayston, the book does come alive.
I first saw this mini series back in 1973 when it was broadcast on the BBC and thought it was wonderful.
So, when I saw the cover to this movie, I was immediately excited to see such fine actors together.
Bogart and Stanwyck are genuinely competent in their roles; Stanwyck in particular turning things up a notch when it becomes clear that she could wind up a murder victim.
Certainly this vehicle gives him play to develop his moods and attitudes which served him so well when it came time for him to work as Captain Queeg in "The Caine Mutiny" (1954).
Great images of terror when he arrives to vandalise in a gas mask.
Only halve way through the movie the movie starts to become interesting when the thriller elements of the movie start to appear in to the story.
Hearing this,Sally comes to the realization that she is Geoffrey's next victim of a well-planned crime.Stanwyck has never been better as a panic-stricken wife,trying to survive her husband's evil doings.Bogart gives a highly underrated performance as a psychopath,who gets brutal when his murder plot doesn't go according to plan.His presence on screen is often frightening.The ending is wonderfully witty and comical.While not in the same league as "The Maltese Falcon"or "Key Largo",this is still a highly entertaining Bogart film,that will not disappoint.
I won't speculate too long, but when Xerxes and Garrison scissor, it's one of the funnier and more graphic scenes I've seen.
Very little is seen of the four boys, except when they hire Mexicans to help do their homework at write essays.
Garrison kicks a Persian in the balls, a reference to when Leonidas kicks a Persian messenger down a hole, and ans many more.
The morning after the murder was committed, Injun Joe blames the whole thing on the town drunk, Muff Potter, saying that Muff committed the murder when Tom knows it was Injun Joe.
I first saw this movie when I was a kid and recently, I have viewed it over and over again because it is one of my favorite movies.
One of my favorite parts in the movie is when Tom says "Last week Aunt Polly whipped me for swiping a pie, but it wasn't me.
Tom has doubts about their oath, however, when an innocent man, Tom's friend, is accused of the murder.
Judith's parents have put light blue vinyl siding on her house... but Judith suspects there are serious dangers from vinyl to humans... during its manufacture, if it burns, when its disposed of.
Not really that educational at all when you think about it.
I honestly don't understand what was going through Scott Alexander and Larry Kawazinky's heads when they wrote and directed this piece of drivel.
Endless gags ensue & each one hits the mark especially where he is attacked in the park & when Danny devito finds his face plastered around the city.
...  Another quality line is when he has one of the three dweebs drugged up...  Richard, "You don't know who I am do ya?"
But try to make it a point to see this movie...on some rainy day when you have nothing better to do.
The main cast here (Dave, Norm, and Danny), do very good with the script they are given, and there were quite a few funny lines throughout the movie (Especially when Dave and Norm's characters meet Danny DeVito's character for the first time, as well as a majority of Mrs. Crock's lines.)
Great jokes from the whole cast Examples: "Well he seemed a lot more ferocious when he was alive."
", Rusty always hits a man with a desk lamp when he is scared, Aunt Mable, Grover the mortician, "A pair of cracker jack cuff links and one crappy pie!
But when they are combined, they somehow manage to conjure that rare magic which we call a good comedy.
Your cue: stop watching when DeVito starts ripping off posters from lampposts.
But things get complicated when the dog gets away and returns home Toto-style, all the while signs of a scuffle and a ransom note ("Pay us one million dollars or he's a dead dog") are left behind, leaving Miss Crock and the police to believe that Willard was kidnapped.
Virginia Crock discovers a room in her mansion ransacked and destroyed, therefore, when she reads the ransom note regarding the assumed capture of her dog, she thinks the reading indicates Willard himself is the hostage.
But, just when you think you are watching an unsung classic, just when you are scratching your head to come up with a resolution, you realize that the film makers do not have one and instead leave us with the ultimate cop-out ending.
It's some three months after the accident that Prof. Constable starts to believe that there may well be something very psychologically wrong with him when one evening driving home he runs into, and almost runs over, a live Mary Constable walking along a lonely road.
First saw this made for TV film back in the 1970s when I was about the same age as the little girl in the movie.I wasn't able to understand it properly at the time,but the ghost theme captured my imagination.I found it very appealing and intriguing when I saw it again much later on as an adult.
When you watch a movie and you find yourself thinking about it days later...i believe thats a sign that the movie you have seen was a good one....and thats what happened when i saw this movie.
The dialogue in the movie and the way he handles it has me watching in awe......the way he talks to his brother and the fact he seems to have so much love and patience with him....is even more amazing when you see how crazy and precise, the character of richard is.
Like Curtis, this movie freaked me out when I was eight years old.
This is one of the rare gems of the made for television movies back in the early seventies.I saw this movie for the first time when I was around eleven years old, and I never forgot it.I saw this recently, and I enjoyed it as much as I did when I was a child.The cast in this movie was very good.
It was a good film until the end credits when we see the American farmer smoking weed.
Sergio Arau is a Mexican artist whose main work has been done in the field of visual arts and in music, but in 1998 he along with his wife Yareli Arizmendi, wrote and directed a short comedy named "A Day Without a Mexican", a fake documentary chronicling the fictitious events that happened in California when suddenly all the Hispanic people disappeared without any reason.
I was expecting the film to be funnier, a black comedy when really you see the melodramatic overtones of human drama and a positive film.
Thrown into the spotlight, the new Gov has to deal with all of the chaos caused by the disappearances as well as the disruptions to his own household when their maid/nanny/cook vanishes.
Other characters include two border patrol officers who are forced to deal with their prejudices when they learn that they no longer have a viable job.
There was this one time in high school when this really insecure skinny kid brought theses yellow-tinted "inside" shades into school.
That is EXACTLY how i felt when i watched this film.
The most significant line was said by the character that was Lila when the acting Governor asked her to tell the Mexicans "We need them" and she replies "They should have heard that sooner".
Of course funny comes at a luxury when you don't even really have a plot or cohesive story line.
He too has a breathtaking scene with Considine when Sonny first confronts Richard and Richard shows no fear whatsoever.
It also shows us even other minority groups can become racist when they are not target themselves.
There are times when you just have to take a movie for what it is- a movie.
What's really funny is when welfare recipients and prisoners are brought in to pick oranges on one farmer's ranch, they're absolutely worthless.
Actually, they're gone for more than one day, but hey who's picky about the name when the idea itself is pretty strange.
when i bought this some time ago (had to order from the UK), i wasn't sure what to expect.
Just look when those big eyes on a green background with the psychedelic sounds come on.
However, it is fun in places; and Mario Landi has proved once and for all that films about murderous comatose patients are much better when they feature a bunch of gory death scenes.
Nobody in the public asked for this film to be made and when released in 3 cinemas... none of which were in the western suburbs because the distributor knew already nobody West would see it... it was a compete financial failure again again again wasting public taxpayer funds which were spent 'creating' this turgid drivel..
It's not exactly a scene rich in dramatic promise, yet when it comes to disarming your prejudices, Krige proves an expert.
And when this routine wears thin, Pete goes to the bunker by the canal and sits smoking and drinking with Mick (Michael Dorman), another equally aimless twentysomething.
However when they contact their commander the news is not good.
The Saturday Night live people who appear in this movie are: Adam Sandler (Who is also very good in his part as a guy who gives Veldar his new identity when Veldar is discovered by Otto as being an "illegal alien".
This movie is totally awesome,when i saw this movie first time back in 1995, i thought it was great funny and somewhat strange.
The absolute best piece of prop comedy of any movie, even Buster Keaton's, is when Beldar chews the condom and then blows it up.
Maybe because I grew up watching SNL live during its first 5 or so years but I really got a laugh out of the Coneheads when they would do that skit on SNL.
The teen in the movie Coneheads plays like the Marylin Munster type as the only semi normal one and her role is kinda lame except when she scarfs down the sub, that was funny, and Farleys reaction was about the best part of the movie.
But, when they settle on the planet they decided to live their lives there instead.
This falls back to a time when crude and rude was still in its infancy.
What surprised me when viewing it after haven't seeing it for over 10 years is that most of the SNL cast is in this movie.
I got turned off right near the beginning of the film when the alien couple got a motel room and the wife was seen laughing out loud as she read the Bible: a typical Hollywood cheap shot.
Some of my favorite lines...like when Primaat and Beldar invite the neighbors over for "charred mammal flesh" or when she reads a magazine and asks Beldar how he'd feel if she passed away (his answer is one that EVERY husband needs to memorize and tell his wife OFTEN!.
As I said above, I haven't been that impressed by many of the films by ex-SNL cast members--especially when they are movie-length versions of SNL skits.
Instead, we are treated to many instances when the Coneheads try so hard to fit in and be the average American family.
The person behind the motorcycle helmet sounds like they're talking through a synthesizer, but when the helmet is taken off, it's just a normal person.
The director wants us to think that the killer is the girl that was raped in the beginning of the movie, it would make sense if it was, when you look at the body of the killer it pretty much matches the body of the girl but then turns out that when they remove the helmet we find out that the killer is the girls father.
The video cover is a bad Mad Max parody, the tagline "cheaper than a chainsaw" doesn't exactly draw the viewer in anymore and when you actually view it, the only reason you keep watching is you can't think it can't get any worse, but boy does it.
We have "nails" that are clearly rubber stuck to "dead people" who are clearly breathing and a killer that miraculously puts on forty pounds and appears to change gender when "unmasked."
The brutality and vulgar cruelty - bested upon Anthony (a very good turn by Kebbell making for very empathetic/sympathetic victim needing to be vanquished) whose only crime was not knowing the common sense in seeing just how ugly his new 'friends' could be (again told in a certain amount of restraint in the scratchy black and white sequences, jarring as they are) - indeed are in need for swift retribution and when we first see Richard, a slight, malnourished pasty-white, scratchily bearded, porcupiney scalp of Considine's character we assume he is just one of the unassuming, local blokes of the pub/ pool hall that one of the goons is dealing drugs in.
His Richard, however, has a soul and it aches you to its core when on display in a heartbreaking twist sequence I will not divulge here but it hits you in the solar plexus.
"Do you remember when you could sit outside and not worry about the mosquitoes and the killers?"
Apparently, this killer has to be funny when he kills, sort of like Student Bodies, except in this case, the funny scenes are when the killer isn't telling jokes.
The best part for me was when the killer says to the big breasted woman: "Get inside, big tits!"
The whole point of the movie is already illustrated during the three-minute pre-credits intro, when a bunch of hillbilly construction workers rape a defenseless girl.
Forget about tension or mystery surrounding the culprit's identity... You need none of that when there already is a guy waving around a nail gun!
One of the most memorable scenes occurs in this film when a girl gets killed and the killer is gloating about it, unfortunately the girl is still very visibly breathing, blinking her eyes and looking around everywhere.
After the massacre has begun, there's a scene in a small shop where the old lady clerk says "Remember when you could go outside without having to worry about the mosquitoes or the killers?".
The first movie in the series had a lot to tell about Bufford Pusser's life and the second in the series had just had few thing that really happened to Bufford but not enough to make it interesting and now the 3rd movie in the series is just horrible worst then the second one and this one doesn't tell anything real about Bufford life except for when he died at the end.
There are a few good moments (when Pusser picks up his trusty bat), but they are very scarce.
The people reject you and even refuse to testify for you when you are attacked and your property is attacked by some local bullies or rough individuals.
For example when Ruth Berlau jumps out of her seat crying that Brecht's daughter wanted to burn her - Berlau died in the CharitÃ© Hospital in Berlin from a fire that she caused by her cigarette - and this is exactly what she is doing in the movie.
The film unfortunately reinforces the old anti-communist clichÃ© of life in the DDR ('East Germany') as a nightmarish existence under a police state, and we are introduced to that idea early on when the Stasi (the DDR's FBI) come knocking at the door to inquire about one of Brecht's guests, Wolfgang Harich.
Harking back to a time when the Brits made decent thrillers instead of clumsy middle class comedies, Dead Man's Shoes is a real breath of fresh air.
The purposely vague ways in which Kaju's family avoids discussion of her past or, when confronted with conflicting information, seek to simply change the subject or stare pensively at the floor felt falsely melodramatic.
But all of my criticisms become quibbles when faced with the undeniable power of the film's few flashback scenes, which depict certain controversial events in an unflinching light.
when innocent Muslims were butchered in Gujrat a few years ago.
ANYONE would embrace strong spiritual guidance when forced to cope with a very early end to their life.
Writer/director Beaird also did the film Scorchers, which I recall recommending to folks years ago when I worked in a video store -- now here's another to add for truly, refreshingly, "touch-my-soul" viewing.
Max's world spirals out of control when he is diagnosed with terminal cancer and Mai Ling becomes his foundation as his health deteriorates and she leads him in exploring the spiritual aspects of his life.
Maxwell's life is ultimately changed when he is able to see life differently through the eyes of both his best friend and his wife, a Chinese woman who he has arranged to marry through a broker.
Things go well for him at first as she appears as subservient as advertised, but when he embarrasses her (and himself) in front of his friends at a poker night, he finds that she is much more than just a prim and proper housewife.
The only thing that kills me about this documentary is when they talk about the tv series Kung fu.
It was infuriating to see the tasteless knockoffs that surfaced when Bruce Lee died.
However, when he was a martial arts coach (he preferred that word, rather than "teacher" or "master"), the top 3 karate tournament competitors were all his students.
Those are just some of the words that come to mind when seeing this awe-inspiring docu-movie about world renowned martial arts philosopher, Bruce Lee.
Why settle for a film with 7 Bruce Lee imitators when you can have the one-and-only.
Having grown up idolising the great man and having seen all his movies countless times, when I first saw the "Curse of the Dragon" documentary I was most intrigued by an interview which was conducted with Bruce's long time friend, colleague and training partner Dan Inosanto where Bruce's original concept for "Game of Death" was brought to light.
This is when he and Buster meet and become teaming acquaintances.
Next, when the bartender is shot down and Buster instantly puts up a sign reading "Bartender Wanted," it's darkly funny although the joke is starting to wear a bit thin.
But the joke is ruined when a gang of sadistic cowboys torment a black man by shooting at his feet to make him dance, and Buster & Roscoe join right in.
They only stop when stern Salvation Army lass Alice Lake enters and puts a halt to the rough-housing, saying "Aren't you ashamed?"
Shearer is terrific in the scene when she learns Novarro is leaving, and helps him pack.
Don't miss a later scene, when Novarro returns to his Old Heidelberg bedroom - especially, watch how Novarro briefly strokes his bed, obviously thinking of Shearer; it's a superb little bit of sexual suggestion.
You'll know when you see Novarro's beautifully acted final scene, in his royal carriage - certainly, it's one of the most memorable performances in silent cinema.
We see the relationship with the very stern King played by Gustave Von Seyfertitz and later on when he's introduced to his tutor and closest friend, Jean Hersholt.
Odd when you consider that during the Thirties they had Allan Jones under contract who would have been wonderful in the part.
Then later Norrington pushes further repeating it with "when a man loves a woman".
Dumped by his girlfriend, he is left to his own devices when he meets a homeless girl who introduces him to some seedy, urban denizens.
This short details a young girl who is operating a train stop when some bandits, or miscreants, or something, begin to threaten her.
Wow was I confused when I saw this movie from 1911.
I didn't recall having seen THE LONEDALE OPERATOR when I started the film, but soon after it started it was like a case of dÃ©jÃ  vu.
This really isn't too surprising, though, as when the film was made back in 1911, outright plagiarism was common and pretty much condoned and many times the same production company would remake their films only a year or so later!
Fifteen-year-old Blanche Sweet plays the daughter of a train station operator, who takes her father's place when he falls ill.
Even when accosted by two men who could easily overpower her, she uses her resourcefulness to outwit the two rather dim-witted thugs, holding them off for just long enough to accommodate the arrival of her rescuer and male suitor (Francis J. Grandon).
In the opening scene, the main character reveals on a televised dating show that his longest ever relationship ended after just three months when he found a used prophylactic in his bed.
It's hard to believe that Miss Blanche Sweet was fifteen when she was directed by the great D.W. Griffith in this Biograph production from 1911.
I remember seeing this film when i was about 8 or 9 in the early 1970s.
( black and white horrors ).If anyone can help me out it would be appreciated.I will pay money and costs of shipping or exchange for some items from Australia ie White pointers (Shark) tooth pendant.On vhs tape can be either ntsc or pal recordings.Just remember you can never replace the memories or scared feelings that these old hammer horrors gave us when we were young and impressionable.I gave this a 10 rating cos it was the first horror film i saw and the fond memories of how scared i was are still with me to this day 30 years later.
Quintillus Aurelius is an Etruscan buried in the volcanic eruption of Vesuvius who returns to the 1950's to reclaim his lost love (who has superhuman lung power - when this girl screams, she SCREAMS!)
Rent it when you are in need of a laugh!
It's a good little movie to watch in the middle of the night (which is when I watched it) and certainly one that is worth a repeat viewing.
I didn't intend to write a comment on this movie, but when I looked at the comments that are here, I was totally shocked to find so many people saying the movie is "great."
I found some of the special effect cheesy (such as when a character is suffering the effects of an explosion).
This was the case when one character came back with a bloody mouth, and missing a friend, all with no explanation.
As others have said, the action begins when Anthony Edwards picks up a ringing pay phone and gets a frantic message from someone in an ICBM silo who has apparently dialed the wrong number saying the missiles are on their way.
But when the hero receives that fateful phone call, it all changes.
The film is all about Ms. Flemming's experience as she makes the documentary and is overly redundant when delivering this information.
His story, at least as related in the movie, is wholly unengaging, and the film does him no favors by droning endlessly trying to make him interesting, when in fact, he is totally undistinguishable from the hundreds of other two-bit performers scraping together a living in the early 1900s.
THE GIFT OF LOVE has got to be one of the most cringe-inducing movies I've seen from the '50s when sentimental tear-jerkers were still the rage, especially if they were dressed up in handsome Technicolor photography and settings...and preferably, with stars like ROBERT STACK and LAUREN BACALL for box-office appeal.
LAUREN BACALL is the noble wife who knows she has a terminal illness, so she prepares the little girl and hubby for her demise, wanting them to go on loving each other and helping each other when she's gone.
That's the plot, in a nutshell, and naturally--when she dies--hubby goes off his rocker and makes thing difficult for the girl, ending up sending her back to the orphanage where they adopted her.
I see from the other comments that this sort of nonsense appealed strongly to teen-age girls when first viewed.
(This during a time when Chinese were still treated poorly by most cultures and by officially repressed by immigration laws worldwide.)
This history is perhaps most important among our relatives who grew up in a time when a man had to wreck his body physically to make a living, or, in order to escape poverty, demonstrate extraordinary ability and courage to overcome stultifying physical and cultural boundaries.
Devil's Island in the Thirties was not any better than it was when Alfred Dreyfus was doing his time in the tropical prison.
Later on we see Hoffman in a different light as if completing the Birdman of Alcatraz analogy, Hoffman's role is similar to that of Telly Savalas who's a tough character when we first meet him in Birdman, but later becomes acclimated to prison life.
******CONTAINS SPOILERS****I watched the movie for the first time when I was really young and remembered it being really gripping and intimidating(especially the bug scenes).
Having re-watched it again over easter, I must say I was just bored and confused when we got to the second half of the movie.
The famous novel, which this film is based on, was a big best-seller when it was released.
when people facing such cruel reality.
I saw this film way back when in a time where Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman were at the height of their popularity.
My favorite part of the movie is when McQueen is in solitary and he tries to stop from going crazy.
That was the first and last time I watched this movie since this year, when I found it in a store and immediately bought it.
A fact that was confirmed few minutes later when I got home and played it.
Most of the film documents how harsh and awful life is in the prison came--either in the work camps or when living in solitary confinement.
For some reason, when I recommended this movie to my friends, the boys seemed to like it more.
Anyway, it's good to watch when you're in mood for a movie.
Papillion should have been played by a younger actor, but who's going to complain when you get an actor of McQueen's caliber?
You might get emotionally confused when watching this movie, you might even sense a little bit of friendship or love between the prison guardians and the prisoners and at the same time you might be able to sense the unreasonable hate.
what does the producer say when he reads the script?
This is a great movie I remember watching on TV when I was young.
Nothing Evelyn does works - and you feel so sorry for her, she's so cute and when we were young we felt so sorry for her.
It's an introduction to the art of cinematography in American movies, with clips and comments from the greats about American film from birth till 1990 or so, when it was made.
But possibly the best part of the movie was when he got his cookie back from the evil critiques!
I was quite young (around 14) when I saw this movie on TV.
While I could not remember the cast very much at that time, the story and the way the actors/actresses had carried the story through made a lasting impression on me - what it means when any child can be your child - it takes only to show love and how it can fill the gaps in our lives.
The beginning of romance between the two and the moments they draw together and next when we see them as a couple are all well portrayed.
Once or twice the program lags when a musical number has little special to offer aside from the merits of the music itself and the novelty of being performed by Muppets, for example "Act Naturally" by Floyd and Janis.
Dudley's best is when he plays Ceasar.
Lily's best is when she plays four or five people in a parody of a war movie (I don't know which).
But the situation regains its lost credibility when Alice's plain Jane roommate Dotty (Barbara Read) calls her a date getter and tells her that the sororities will want her once they see her because she will attract men.
Hey, remember when MTV was music videos?
I started going to movies with my mother when I was 3 and of the thousands I've seen, this is one of my all time favorites.
Now they were going to far when they totally copied the Blair Witch Project with the Running through the woods scene with the creepy old house, and not to forget the cheesy disclaimers that it was deemed "lost footage" and such nonsense.
I was born and raised in Vancouver so when I heard about The Real World: Vancouver I was pleasantly surprised.
I was struck by her saying how this movie has "haunted her" since she saw it when she was about the same age as I was!
Just when I think my family gets a little too crazy, I always have "The Birdcage" to assure me all is well.
I briefly entertained the foolish thought that the plot may actually have been going somewhere when the tall skinny bitchy one started telling her fellow "cast members" that this was exactly what Roland wanted them to do--get all their issues out and create conflict and fulfill their stereotypes.
It's never very promising when advertising campaigns for upcoming television shows have to constantly remind us of how unoriginal the program is by endlessly comparing it to other popular shows.
If I were to venture a guess, TBS spent most of its budget on My Boys and when the numbers came in lower than expected, they spent the surplus money on this cheap The Office knockoff.
So I checked the schedule, found out when it was going to be on, set my TV to remind me that it was going to come on and got my snack and my drink all ready to watch what I thought was going to be a great show......  Unbelievable disappointment.
Seriously you never hear anyone talking about how annoying all those Law and Orders/ CSI.. they are all the same show but you never hear anyone downing those.There are obviously going to be similarities when watching TV shows so why not watch it for what it is instead of picking out the things that its not?
This is one of those rare shows that remains funny when watching it again and again.
It's sparking feedback and dialog from it's fans and when the show comes out on DVD (as it will undoubtedly will) I'm going to be at the local grocery store to buy it.
How disappointed I was when I learned what the movie was really about.
A father who was passive and it seemed like he wanted to say something important but never does, her not being smart, but being in the fat suit she starts to study and does better in summer school than ever before, the emphasis jocks place on looks and being in good physical condition, but the poor guy gets a headache when she tries to explain what she's going through, that it's better to exist on chemical shakes and veggies, than a balanced diet, etc, etc.
Right...well Ali (based on a "true" Story) is a bit of a Fat Phobic (just like almost in one in America who's never felt the pain of being fat)..thinking it all about your attitude..and when she loses her sports scholarship..she decides to enter a student film competition for the prize money for school.....and her idea is to prove being unhappy and fat is all out the fat person's negative attitude....if only people like her little brother(overweight) had a positive attitude their lives would be better..thats why she's popular (not because she's a pretty blonde jock)..the commercials leading up to this promised a true look/insight into one area of life where bigotry and prejudice are allowed to reign supreme... i "thought" finally people see something about the cost of our obsession with weight...how thou bashing of gay and others may be illegal...but fat bashing is More than OK....But the promise of the commercials was NEVER delivered...even although Ali don's the "Fat suit" for at least a month...at the end of it..she's still very hateful over her mom's past weight (its treated like a very dirty little secret)..never asking why people over eat...or even some the different causes people gain weight, her partner on the film has a hard attitude towards the world in general and never stops calling the one "fat" girl and meets and befriends.."her Fat friend"...after a month spent on this Ali changes only a little..after lying to everyone very little is said after ward...you keep waiting/hoping for her "a Ha!
Moment" when finally the light turns on...but we all stay in the dark...along w/her...even at the end when her "boyfriend" admit being a jock if she were to quote "get fat"...he would dump her..because well he's a jock basically...she just shrugs smiles...but then again Jenny Craig was the sponsor...guess that should have told me something....at the end she more or less right and don't let the world decide who you are....or I'm not Shallow...just selectively deep;(
Then there are the little noises that emerge from people when we fat people are around, the "boom, boom, boom" when you walk by them, or even the stares and giggles.
Her mother, played by Caroline Rhea, was fat, and when diagnosed with diabetes, did nothing to improve her eating, and ended up in the hospital.
This movie really touched on what us fat people feel when we look in the mirror, what our diminished self esteem can be like when people continually taunt us, and what its like to shop in a store where we don't get the service we deserve because of our weight.
The way this poor soul is treated is pretty pathetic, however the irony occurs when the younger crook is stranded in Albania and his car is vandalized.
The same can be said about bits of dialog and brief encounters throughout the film: Much as in real life, their importance, the lesson they impart, is only understood when stepping back to look at the big picture.
Amelio achieves a sense of understanding and a sorrow and pity that one can have only when everything has been stripped away and nothing but one's essential humanity remains.
When asked his age he holds up his fingers twice, and you realize he thinks he's twenty -- the age he was when he was first imprisoned.
He runs around looking for Spiro, and when he gets back to the car, it's been stripped of its tires.
Maybe when this movie was released it had some significance, but it is not worth the rental unless you want to see how bad film-making can be.
I think my favorite part in this movie is when he, Ross, takes the camera to a woman he sort of saw in High school.
It's impossible to become fully absorbed in the story when the subject repeatedly shifts from history lesson to love triangle to stalking celebrities.
I saw that film when i studied films in england, i liked the director's techniques with his subjects.First of all he provokes them in order to get more informations from them, second he manages to become intimate to the viewer with his monologues that take the form of a confession.Many commented that his life is pathetic, maybe so, but it takes courage to expose to the public some very 'personal' moments.Many people might comment about the ethics of documentary, because sometimes he seems to abuse some of his subjects, or even mock them,i have a specific scene in my mind:When he interviews one of the so called patriots,inside a snack bar he pans his camera and while we listen to the 'patriotic credo' we watch another man dressed like a clown.I think this is a film that deserves to be seen because it is a prerequisite for people who enjoy BIG BROTHER and other similar assortments, that victimize their subjects sometimes to the extreme.Compared to those SHERMAN'S MARCH is very innocent much more entertaining though.8/10
I liked all of that and it was a fresh approach when it first came out.
Wisely, he trimmed the original title a bit, which he perhaps could have done with the movie itself, which is a bit long, 155 minutes, but it doesn't matter much, especially when watching it at home.
Well, as real as life can be when you know someone has a film camera on their shoulder and they are filming you.
The title reveals itself at the end when Walt runs to the museum to see the large representation of a Squid and a Whale with Lou Reed's monotonous voice in the background giving the film a polished ending.
He attatches himself to the older son because he tries to emulate his father, and thus reads what books he's told are good, and passes those he's told are not; watches what movies his father likes while avoiding those his father doesn't; thinks and speaks how his father would, when it's obvious he knows almost nothing about what he's talking about.
This last point is brought to attention throughout the movie; from plagiarizing the song, to talking to his girl-friend about Kaufkas "Metamorphasis" (both times), to when his teacher says he doesn't think that Walt's read The great Gatsbey (despite his excellent paper on the subject).
It's almost painful, at times, to watch Walt slavishly take his father's advice when it is clearly the wrong advice for him, as an individual, to be taking, and how he always blindly takes his father's side over his mother's.
You know time has caught up with you when you start noticing little facts like that about an actor you'd happily watch reading the phone book.
Later in the film his younger son Frank is persuaded by his mother's emotional blackmail to stay with her when he should be with Bernard.
Thus, when the sexual relationship between Bernard and Lili is revealed and used by Bernard's wife to justify her own infidelities, the astute viewer is able to discern the important distinction between the two.
I can only imagine the difficulties that face children when their parents get divorced, but the film also includes the anxieties of teenagers something that most people can relate to in one way or another.
An upsetting scene in the film was when the girlfriend of the older son says that her mum doesn't like her dating him because his parents are divorced, and that that bad relationship might reflect on their relationship.
Her inability to put the brakes on when telling her sons about her relationship experiences and history are hilarious.
In Walt, Eisenberg creates a wonderful picture of adolescent priggish arrogance covering up inexperience and naivety Â his determination to ape his father's character and views only serves to heighten the discomfort when he is eventually disillusioned.
His brother has presented a song to an audience at a high school talent contest as his own, when it is really the work of a famous member of a rock group.
It all comes to a head when Walt confesses to the school counselor that he used to like his mother some when they watched Robin Hood together on television, and when she reassured him after he saw the picture of an enormous whale swallowing the squid at the Museum of Natural History.
The two parents were letting their kids regularly insult them, but when 15 year old Walt calls his mom a bitch, even Linda is alarmed and complains.
This is when the two kids start to realize their parents particularly Bernie, have clay feet.
We all collectively squirmed in our seats, looked at one another and winced when the preteen Frank masturbated in the school library, then wiped his semen on some books on the shelf.
A quadrangle and a triangle of sorts develops when Bernard rents a room to one of his female students, Lili, and begins a tentative affair with her.
Look at when he and Walt curse over losing a table tennis match in almost exact verbal intonations, or when both he and Frank lock themselves in their elitist world and chatter about Kafka, how Bernard has decided he was once a brilliant writer which may or not be true, and how "A Tale of Two Cities" was a lesser Dickens as if reading it meant getting an eye infection.
Frank, in imitating his father's worst traits, when it is discovered that a song he'd written was in fact a song by Pink Floyd and in a Ted Bundy style argues that "it was as if he had written it so it was his by appropriation" exposes him for the empty snob he is on the inside.
Joan, while a little unsympathetic here and there, is a real human and one who maintains her composure when its clear her writing career is on the rise even if her family is about to implode.
I'd like to thank the whole crew for making a film about people and human relationships in a time when so many movies seem to be about nothing more then eye candy.
The Berkman household in Park Slope, Brooklyn, appears to be normal when we are introduced to the family.
The quartet is harmonious in literary pursuits and drastic life changes when the parents agree on separating sending the boys (and ultimately themselves) into an emotional tailspin.
Added to the mix is Lili (Paquin), a female writing student of Bernard's, who has a hidden agenda when Bernard invites her to share his new home as a roommate while the boys visit every other day with mixed results.
Baumbach is clearly making a heartfelt valentine to his own upbringing when his parents eventually divorced during his trying teens and the affects that have rubbed off are bittersweet and universally humorous.
Laura Linney is again perfection (when is she not, really) as the mother just starting her own brilliant literary career and who is a bit too open about her sexuality with her children.
Thanks to her distinct similarity in looks to Linney, I laughed outloud when Daniels tells Eisenberg "she's not my type".
Brooklyn College was a hotbed of activism and liberal arts when I first encountered Jonathan Baumbach (rechristened "Bernard" in the film, a sly wink at Jonathan's mentor and hero, Bernard Malamud).
There are awkward moments when this doesn't totally work.
I laugh a lot when I watch this movie because the lines are hysterical.
It sounds like they're reading a phone book when they should be sounding scared and anxious.
Of course, the next night when Weiss visits the townie in order to commit adultery, she bites him.
It tries to build an air of mystery but the problem is you know you're watching a film called Howling IV: The Original Nightmare which is a sequel in a series of film all about Werewolves so when they finally do make an appearance it's far from surprising.
I kept looking at the clock, wondering when a werewolf would actually show up.
So when Clive Turner decided to do a third Howling sequel he decided to make it closer to the novel which was fine.
But when there the delusions continue and she gets herself muddled up in a mystery to do with werewolves and a nun.
The special effects are actually very good, but unfortunately you don't see any of them until the last ten minutes of the movie when they're all thrown together in a hectic mish-mash.
First I must say that I am a big Paul Verhoeven fan and when I heard that he was directing Hollow Man with Kevin Bacon (who I am also a big fan of) I was really excited.
Reisner had used Maggie as a guinea pig to kill Michael but this plan fails and the doctor wants to know why Michael's superior, Colonel Gavin Bishop(William MacDonald)couldn't catch him when his men had the invisible maniac within their grasp.
When they go to interview a colleague of the deceased man, they come attack from a mysterious enemy and, when his partner is killed, the male detective is pulled into the mysterious world of invisibility experiments that the man's colleague was involved in and the dark motives behind the killing.
Even when he's wearing a latex mask you can clearly see both that he is there and that he isn't.
It's actually a waste to have a guy like Slater, who can act when he wants to, attached to this in-name-only sequel, but Hollywood was thinking name value.
The thing is that I like Christian Slater, I think he can be a damn good actor when motivated, so what happened to him?
It's always sad when one's life is cut short.
It's sadder when you are brought into that person's life and given a glimpse of how they lived.
To be cheated of ones future especially when you did everything right, raised your child properly.
If this movie teaches anything, that is that even when the fates deal a cruel blow (or two), the nature of a woman, a mother, a fighter, is to never give up.
Debra Winger gives the performance of her life and tells all to keep trying when things don't work out.
She gets thrown out of her apartment when her neighbor, a nebbish bookstore clerk and aspiring writer named Felix Sherman, reports her clandestine activities to the landlord.
and says the "F" word (unfortunately cut out of the DVD version though it's obvious when she says it).
There's no plot to speak of Â instead, we follow the two stars on a logical pattern of location-hopping around New York throughout which their relationship blossoms: from his apartment when she's evicted because of his snitching (which leads to both of them being given the gate by the landlord), to them shacking up at the flat of Segal's pal (who drives them out because of their constant bickering), then going their separate ways till they meet again (after he has learned about her movie experience Â a hilarious scene Â and a 'colleague' of hers has gone to see him at his workplace) and go out together (where they're harassed by a band of thrill-seekers), after which they find themselves at the house of Segal's fiancÃ©e (a scene with an unexpectedly ironic punchline), to finally deciding to be completely honest with one another (beginning with their real names).
Watch his expression when he's stoned and naked in the tub with Streisand and they hear the doors open and close as his fiancÃ©e and her family arrive unexpectedly.
This was a huge flop when it was released (if memory serves correctly, it is in the Box Office Failures Hall of Fame).
Chris Farley had died five months before its release, there were bad screenings, negative sneak preview reviews, etc... and when they finally put it out, the film tanked.
Also there is annoying edit when Streisand says the word "f***".
Some viewers could argue that THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT is little more than two characters insulting each other for 95 minutes, but - when those insults are so rigorously funny - who cares?
I think well-respected film critic Pauline Kael said it best when she wrote, "Were Tracy and Hepburn ever this good.
Many classic scenes, Bombs Away, TV in the aquarium, Barbra's hands and heart placed just .....hovever, when the DVD company from hell released it on DVD, they censored a word that renders an entire scene meaningless.
She goes from rags to riches when she catches the eye of Guido; an Italian mobster who takes her out of the cafÃ© and into the gangster life.
She soon realises that all that glitters is not gold when she witnesses a mob hit and the boss wants her silenced.
Guido then decides to push her into prostitution, but when he is caught by the law; she decides to escape him and makes a new life with her son and a doctor.
Anyway, this film is extremely fast moving (almost too much so for its own good), covering a lot of ground in just 95 minutes, and ultimately gets a tad soapy in its final 1/3, when Anna gets involved with the surgeon who saves her son's life.
There are spectacular moments like when they are surrounded in a town and try to escape, with Yvette Duguay helping by turning a track on a circular platform.
Also when they hold up the two banks in Coffeyville at the same time.
I watched it, wondering why I was doing so when I had an excellent book on the go that I could have picked up and why people make movies like this.
The final insult came when I discovered here on IMDb that all the women characters are drag queens!
I still can't keep a straight face when imagining him trying to say "as-tro-phy-si-cist."
Last evening I was looking for something really special to veiw, thats when I stumbled on to her latest film, "Girls Will be Girls".
I first caught this movie when it aired on CW a few months ago.
One of the highlights for me and among my favorite parts is when Bart gets carried away by the eagle before falling into the ocean (or was it the sand dune/beach?
Especially when they encounter all the pitfalls throughout their journey, the script is very sharp and funny.
Now this may sound like crazy fun but NOT when you have to endure lousy acting performances and lamentable dialogs for 127 damn long minutes.
Who the hell is interested in an extra long version of a crap film anyway, especially when the additional footage only serves more crap?
He/she does eventually, when the macho boys try to impress Gabrielle with their nasty shark-hunting games, and after killing Miguel this chapter ends suddenly, like it was just a tiny little sub plot.
I love it when Hunt gets attacked by the eagle.
And when Edwards eats the eagle egg shell medicine.
when i started to watch it looked kinda interesting but later on...uh, this is the most boring shark flick ever!.
The best part of this film was Susan George and Fiona Lewis, both looked stunning when they wear nothing.
And the way these guys act when they pick up women - WOW - you know you're in a movie as this stuff would never work in real life.
I didn't expect much when I started watching this series - I was pleasantly surprised, the series is exciting, sometimes fun, it's got both drama and suspense, I love it.
But maybe that was necessary to portray just how dangerous and vicious racism can be when it ingrains itself into a culture.
I remember watching it when I was young, it was one of the few rated R movies my parents would allow me to watch.
Great suspense, and a great depiction of this time in history, when being black in the South might get you killed.
Just when you thought I liked nothing more then "shoot-em up" or 'slap-stick' comedies..
One syllable from him is more subtle than an entire Shakespeare speech when delivered by a lesser actor.
Not long after they enter the town they see that it will not be easy, the townspeople are very hostile towards them and the KKK is involved, Mr. Ward soon ask for more FBI agents, even when Mr. Anderson thinks it is a bad idea.
The KKK set a church for black people on fire to scare the black people into not talking to the FBI, when Ward and Anderson walk into a restaurant and try talking to a black person he says: ''I have nothing to say to you'' but still the townspeople beat him up for talking to people from the FBI.
There is also a tune in the film when something bad is about to happen, when you hear it for the first time in the movie recognize the tune immediately, when you hear it you feel uncomfortable and are at the tip of your seat.
Mississippi Burning is set in 1964 when three civil rights activists are murdered in a small town by the Ku Klux KlanÂ Two of them were white and one of them blackÂ  Based on actual events in Philadelphia, the screenplay centers chiefly on the hostility relationship between the two FBI agents (Gene Hackman and Willem Dafoe) sent down to the small Mississippi town to seek information about the vanishing of the three victimsÂ Immediately upon their arrival, they are greeted with hostility by the local law enforcement and the town in generalÂ   Dafoe's WardÂ in charge of the caseÂcomes off as the embodiment of everything those men in the south dislike about the "Yankees" who are coming down there commanding them how to actÂ   Anderson(Hackman), who was once a Mississippi officer himself, has a special feel for how to settle things with SouthernersÂ He uses his charm to win the confidence of the friendly wife of a Klansman deputy, whom he suspects holds the key to unravel the details of the caseÂ  The scenes between McDormand and Hackman are the best of the filmÂ They dramatize how quickly two lonely people can match...
Mississippi Burning shows us how strange people are when it comes to racism.
So when I read on his Myspace page that he was making a horror film, I couldn't wait to go see it.
Spadaccini does capture this emotional dichotomy of the couple beautifully, such as when Wayne and Andrea are having a minor domestic argument in the bedroom, and Wayne considers the only way to soothe his wife's rising anger is to take her on a drive to find another hapless victim that will sooth his own.
But when deconstructing their behaviour it seems fairly obvious this is not a gruesome tale of two serial killers, but a tragic tale of a married couple seeking to invigorate their sterile marriage.
Both characters display an overt sense of emotional detachment that comes forcefully through when dealing with their victims.
Ironically, this is the brutal turning point of the film when Monica enters the room to make the horrific discovery, and Wayne enacts punishment in the only way he knows best.
Indeed, when Wayne seeks to initiate Andrea into his sadistic world we know there is no hope for this couple, and the sooner this nightmare is destroyed the better it will be for all concerned.
You watch them and jump when you're meant to jump and you scream when you're meant to scream, but at the same time you're thinking that this could never happen to you.
However, when they're planning or carrying out their horrific murders, they're just as casual about it!
He proved to us all that try as you may, but even being that sexy can't save you when you've gone down the wrong path.
This hit is the majority of the film and you can only imagine what becomes of him when the job is done.
Abraham looks even more sexy than he usually does in this film and when he is beside Chopra, the screen just begins to melt from their combined hotness.
I say the director was quite ambitious when he undertook the making of this film but i feel it paid off.
However the colour and light seems to be threatened by shadows and darkness such as when ACP Singh searches John's house, you can hardly see any light and colour as it is half engulfed in darkness .
the flashback scene of John's first kill, was in animation, black and white for John's dream and sepia for the song Tera Hi Karam when he was in huge depression.
I also noticed a goof when John received his wife's finger it was a full finger but when he was talking to her on the phone after the song Ishq Nachaya Kare her finger was half cut.
I first saw this film when I was 17.
Whatever the case, when I have trouble conceptualizing the viability towards one of MAIN characters, I find the rest of the film to be contrived and lackluster.
The interesting thing is that, when the credits finally rolled, I was satisfied with what I'd seen.
And she is a bit of a b*tch towards Dr. Halsey, when she says, "I'm not the one on your couch, I'm paying you to make us a happy family."
It's lovely when the film company put effort in to it.
It turns out that something strange and paranormal happened when both Kelly and Linda died,Kelly was resuscitated back to life,and it's that incident in death that somehow connected the two in life.
"Spectres" is a lot like the famous James Stewart film "It's a Wonderful Life" in that it shows how precious one's life really is and, no matter how bad things are, throwing it away would not make things any better but make them much worse when one realizes what a mistake he, or she, made by doing that.
You start to see, like Kelly does, what a waste it is when you give up the most precious gift that God gave you.
During others (did they toss both of the leads in rehab halfway through shooting, then continue when they were out?)
The audience was us and maybe a dozen other Farley fans who sat silently when he wasn't onscreen, then you'd hear us all laugh at the top of our lungs scattered from various parts of the mostly empty auditorium (the laughs were scattered, not our lungs, sorry for the bad grammar) when he did or said something funny.
The scene where he has to go find an eagle's egg in the wilderness to cure his sick friend is priceless, and so is his comment when he finally brings it back and finds out which part of the egg they needed.
The film sags in the first hour because there is too much exposition (and some attempts at social-drama undertones), and it doesn't much improve when the actual heist begins.
The movie developed a loyal following when it started running on cable!
I was not alive when this movie was made but i LOVED IT!!
I saw this at the movies when it first came out and found it to be very funny and enjoyable.
At first we give Edwards kudos for deselecting him, but when Fontenot lets it be known that he'll only join the expedition if his hot Indian woman (she's not a spouse or girlfriend to him, but property), Shaquinna (Lisa Barbuscia), can also come along, Edwards figures that they probably won't need a translator's services that badly anyway, so brings him on the journey.
The film's ending is short but fitting, and while I felt it may have been lacking a bit, it's also forgivable when you take into consideration the rest of the film's quality.
I first saw this movie when I was about eight or nine, about thirty years ago, on morning television.
Watching these two spar when all the film's secrets have been revealed is one of those moments I won't soon forget.
One of my most favorite parts had to be when they bring the boat ashore and meet the Native Americans, and they think the really tall one's the Chief, but it turns out he's not, his real name's Bent Twig and he's really mentally retarded.
What's a poor widow to do when her husband dies and leaves her penniless?
She is at her best when putting on airs and verbally sparring with unarmed opponents.
Many deliciously diabolical scenes abound, like when pesky canine Chloe threatens to dig up the dirt on her murderous past-time, Page as Marrable barks back: "I have not taken loving and diligent care of my garden to have it wrecked by this vagrant bitch!"
But when she's tardy serving up cocktails, an impatient Geraldine rips her a new one: `Punctuality is essential to a gracious way of life, which I do not intend to give up on account of you.'
so how come in the end when she passes by Julie they don't even look at each other as if they haven't met..... if someone could explain me it would be very helpful.
The theory of Julie being a real illegitimate daughter of another mother has one flaw, almost fatal, and that's she does not look surprised at the end when she see's Julia and her father.
So when Sarah goes to France, she stays a house that her boss owns, and later in the evening, his daughter comes in very unexpectedly.
Her self- esteem is reduced to nothing when she has no sexual power.
And it is very clear that she got raped by her father when she was 13, although it isn't said (the scar on Julies stomach indicates a cesarean section/ she lost her virginity when she was 13/her father is the "king of orgies")  The publishers "english daughter", named Julia, is french Julies child.
The film is about authors, creative writers and creative minds and the place they go when in need of a new idea or story.
It also allows us to identify the changes she goes through when put up against her opposite in Julie, and how forced interaction with this 'type' of person forces a confrontation with typical feelings and emotions.
Onto Sarah's 'look' in the film, something Ozon pays specific attention to when Julie is engaging in what makes her what she is.
Later on, when she makes love to one of a few random men she finds during her nights out, Sarah cannot hep but become interested and observes in the same composition before later still, there actually is a reaction shot from Sarah, during another sex act in the house's swimming pool from which the title derives.
What Charlotte doesn't know is that she is about to be french fried when she discovers that the young voluptuous sex-crazed daughter of the owner of the villa has also decided to dive into the chateau.
My favourite line from the film is when Charlotte says: "Hmph!
AND the tremendous satisfaction when you realize you've created something that a) was inside you that just had to come out and b) is the best work you can do and c) others will enjoy reading.
Later, when Sarah had visited the cafÃ© several times and become more familiar with Franck (real or not, it doesn't matter) she realized he could become a more important character in her story by having Julie bring him into the plot via a more fully-developed twist.
Right from the start there is an ingenious mismatch of facts that you start to brush off, and when things develop in ways I don't dare suggest for fear of ruining things, these clues grow in meaning.
The mix-and-match mode - as strand crosses strand, weaving a rich texture of reality versus illusion, fiction versus fact, and dream versus daylight - the enjoyment being in the management (in each viewer's mind) of the strands, understanding when the author's fiction is being played-out across the screen; and when we are back again inside the movie-director's mind (as opposed to one of his character's i.e the novelist).
Killing him is getting rid of him from her life and allowing her to move on - which she does at the end when she moves to a new publisher.
This all comes together at the end when you meet the real daughter - the symbolism still keeps me thinking of each scene and what it actually meant.
The ending to this film made it all worthwhile, however and it is very exciting when we feel we need a 2nd viewing of a movie to really absorb it all.
"Swimming Pool" plays tricks with your perceptions, but the finale to which the film builds seems somewhat anti-climactic when it finally comes.
However, her tranquillity is soon disturbed when her publisher's daughter; a sex-crazed, good time girl, turns up out of the blue and turns Morton's rest into something quite different.
It is likely that he rose to such prominence mostly because of his winning personality and good looks, rather than the movie plots, but in studying Western movie history, I learned that when he was given his chance to be the star of his own series, he set out to be good at his job.
But when a famous ballet director (who doesn't know about her health problems) asks her to dance for him because he seeks inspiration in order to improve his latest production, she can't resist the temptation...
He meets his teacher and they fall in love, but when his spell as an adult is over, their love has to end.
But the teacher has changed, and when she later meets another man, she might find lasting love...
It's so much smarter than the average Hollywood film -- which may have been its problem when released?!
This is one of the few movies that I've watched repeatedly or when I need an attitude boost.
She grew up in Rome when World War II was occurring.
It is hard to believe she was only nineteen when she filmed the movie.
Several years ago, when I first saw this movie, I felt that it was melodramatic with awkward dialogue and clumsy direction, and not worth my time, except for the dancing segment with Moira Shearer and James Mason ("Jealous Lover").
The delicacy of Shearer, Caron and Angeli with the differences in each of their coloring and bone structure, contrasts dramatically with their respective male leads, the forceful articulateness of Mason (given an incredibly weak script stilted and overwrought when compared to P & P's dialogue for Lermentov in "Red Shoes"), the boyish tenderness of Granger in the second segment, and the snappy personality of Douglas in the high wire segment.
The highlight of the film, for me, was the irrepressible Orville coming back from one death after another, and not seeming to hold all the abuses against anyone, when it's over.
To me, I know what to expect when I see a video box that has a woman on the front cover wearing a bra and holding a machine gun, along with a 4-Star Rating from Joe Bob Briggs.
But the silly scenes are overshadowed by some funny moments, like when a girl is running to her truck to get away and drops her keys right as she gets in.
The SFX was good when it occurred, which wasn't enough.
No comedy ever written, however classic and hilarious some are, could come close to bringing you the sheer joy you will feel when the credits roll on this film.
There are a number of flaws in the movies: day turns to night and night to day in the middle of scenes; characters' appearances change between cut away scenes, only two vampires combusted when exposed to daylight while many others walked around during the day without problems.
Other the vampire connection none of those three plots feel connected to one another in the least until the end when they had to be tied together somehow.
Still when they DO have scenes they're OK. Tommy Lister is the real star of the movie and he does the best job that he could have done with such ridiculousness.
It is laugh-out-loud funny as well as warm, touching and authentic when it comes to depicting relationships between friends and spouses...a totally worthwhile experience!
While in the right hands the scenario of an innocent woman at the mercy of psychos with neither knowing where the other is can be (and has been) done effectively, here Klenhard's sloppy directing and slack writing wipe out any suspense and rack up the unsubtle hints ("You could scream for days and nobody could hear you") while the implausibilities steadily get in the way of any effectiveness - one of the few decent moments comes when Josie is trying to get out of the locked-up condo where most of the action takes place and finds she's trying to force the gate open with the plank the villains used to beat her friend to death, but then you're wondering why they dragged her corpse out of her apartment in the first place.
There is one saving spot in the movie when you think "I wish he would do this or that to that witch and HE DOES".
(when saleem is praying, the sikh friend is talking to him while sitting in front of him- IMPOSSIBLE!)
Whomever filmed this to leave a meerkat dead when they obviously were there filming it and could have saved it is not an animal lover in my opinion.
In addition, Jagjit's conflict is resolved when his father seee the Garba Ras decorations and asks what type of engineering design he used.
Like when Len and Squiggy died and I cried my boyfriend had to tell me that even if the researcher's hadn't been there and this hadn't been broadcast it still would have happened.
It is heart wrenchingly sad when something bad happens but so amazing when something good happens.
Particularly so, when it becomes clear that the film is made from an Indian-American perspective i.e.
Although I have to admit he did do wonderful in his "Teach me" scene as well as when he portrayed val's mother.
I found my- self drawn to the TV set every Saturday night when Airwolf was on CBS.
Still, when I met the helicopter in Van Nuys, CA in 1986 I was so honored and overwhelmed.
It was a treat months ago when they reran it on the Sci Fi Channel for 8 hours a day, two days in a row.
I started watching Meerkat Manor about 18 months ago when I turned the T.V.
It was very sad when Flower died but that is a part of nature and it is no-one's fault not even the Researchers, that was the saddest episode of the whole series.
I also felt sad for Mozart and Tosca when Flower evicted them from the family.
This can be compared to Guns N' Roses back in the hair band days, when that album (Appetite for Destruction) came out, it kicked all the other hair bands butts!
Often String is called in for dull jobs like being a stunt man for movies, but when they hear from the Firm, a mysterious government group that Airwolf has been stolen, they try to get Hawke involved-he is the only man to have flown it, aside from Moffet, the sociopath who has stolen it.
The late Hemmings is clearly evil as Moffet, giving one of his best performances and we are genuinely pleased when he gets what he deserves.
The old flame is really a nice guy and Fatty finally realizes this and welcomes the guy when he awakens from these bad dreams.
Jack holds Mabel in his arms, in an attempt to get her back on her feet again, when Roscoe opens the door with a gun in his hand.
If HE DID AND HE DIDN'T actually was intended as a parody of the many short dramas of the era, it surely says something about Arbuckle's talent when his performance leaves the viewer wonder whether it was supposed to be serious or amusing.
Mabel seems loving but giddy and when a childhood friend comes for a visit, Mabel and he begin to flirt.
Arbuckle (in a car with right-hand drive) is lured to a remote location on a ruse, so that he'll be away when burglars invade his house.
Add in Arbuckle's casual gags and the result is an excellent comedy that is still highly watchable -- except, of course, when you are trying to make sense of real-life nephew Al St. John's awful mugging and high-speed rowdyism.
It is over the booth that I always sit in when I eat there.
In Speedway, Presley is a race car driver on a winning streak, when he meets up with Nancy Sinatra everything starts getting into the way including his old buddy, Bill Bixby.
The first season ended with a huge mystery that they say will be explained when the second season opens.
A year later in the June of 1968 history would be made when Elvis once again entered a stage for the first time in 7 years to record his TV special for NBC now affectionately known as 'the Comeback'.
So I decided to watch it when it came in.
It's from there that a delightful and very funny comedy begins,mainly revolving around Elsie's unfamiliarity with royal protocol and manners and you see two different worlds collide.One of the funniest moments is when Elsie ends up being lady in waiting to the eccentric Queen Dowager(Sybil Thorndyke and attends the coronation with her and Charles.)
For the record, when released in 1957 the film only re-couped the cost to make and distibute it.
This one gets broadcast a lot for some reason when greater classics do not.
And I may add Â though I am aware that this is a matter of taste entirely Â that Marilyn was never sexier than when she played Elsie Marina.
when she reads Charles's written invitation (she has her hair down and looks like a Vermeer beauty), when she enters the Carpathian embassy and admires at the gilded decorations, when she is engulfed in her marvellous reverie in Westminster Abbey etc.
Because when a powerful man in a 1957 movie has political opponents arrested without trial on charges of "un-Carpathian activity," that's a comment on the ongoing red scare in the US rather than on Imperial Germany.
It's almost uncanny that Arthur Miller, whom Marilyn had wed just a few months before, was present when the movie was shot AND had to appear before the House Un-American Activities Committee immediately when he returned from England.
And by the time "The Great War" starts the Brits have a way more modern machine gun than the 08 in the shape of the famous Vickers gun Â as do the Yankees when their forces enter WWI (Browning M1917 machine gun.)
Monroe was already in her thirties when the film was made, but the naÃ¯ve and innocent Elsie seems much younger, whereas the middle-aged Charles seems a man old before his time, an impression created as much by his stiffness of manner and bearing as by his grey hair.
This is one of those movies where the set pace of events are known to the audience, so that when it reaches it's conclusion we are aware that what we (the audience) might wish can happen for the two leads is not going to be possible.
She gave so much difficulty to him, he did not direct another film until 1970 when he did Checkov's THE THREE SISTERS.
This movie was made for a very small budget ($100,000 at a time when the average movie cost $15 million).
Maybe the script wasn't even done when they began, and as they were shooting they were continually unhappy with the tenor of their footage, so they periodically changed gears.
Later, when s/he is just a guy, we keep hoping s/he'll put the bra and wig back on.
One of the captives, a young man named Jaguar Paw, manages to lower his pregnant wife and young son into a crevasse to hide them from the pillagers, but when they are left with no means of escape, Jaguar Paw realizes he must survive and return to save them.
"The Spaniards arrived 500 years later" You really don't know when the movie takes place until the end when the conquistadors show up.Then we see, aha: the year is 1511 + something.Is this possible?Why not?The end of the great Mayan civilization was about 900 A.D. After that we have the post classic period until 1511 (the year of the arrival of Cortes).Gibson doesn't claim that the occurrence's in the film take place in the early Mayan history.To all the haters of the film who have a problem with not presenting the great achievements of that culture(mathematics, astrology an so on):That was BEFORE the happenings in the movie!And besides, that was not the story of the movie.Not showing the greatness of the culture doesn't mean that Gibson denies it!
Anyway, we don't necessarily need the answer, but we do need the consciousness and introspection because when we project ourselves against the primitive background, we can always discover new things in our body and soul.
I am also glad that they have begun to rerun it occasionally on Sunday nights, so that when we do miss a show, we can catch up.
When he doesn't have us perched on the edge of our seats worrying about how Jaguar Paw is going to escape, Gibson ramps up the tension by cross-cutting to the predicament that pregnant wife Seven deals with when snarling jungle predators enter the pit and a torrential storm threatens to drown them.
Despite the fact that Mel Gibson is a not-so-great guy as a person, there's no denying that he's a master when it comes to film-making.
The Spaniards were very much astonished when they witnessed their first human sacrifice, talk about cultural clash.
You know whats going to happen long before it does, and when it does, it looks good, but it's still not very fulfilling.
The achievements of the post-Classic period, 900-1521 A.D., were a far cry from the CLassic Period; the cities were in decay and the people scattered; nothing of the city life portrayed in the movie existed in 1519, when Cortes first entered the Yucatan peninsula.
This is called pulp, which when treated by someone with an ounce of wit (i.e.
The subtitles actually help in that lines which might have sounded silly or stilted when spoken in English somehow "work" when condensed to printed form.
Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" is not a normal movie but a big make-up movieÂ   From the moment the film starts to the moment it ends you feel you are transported into the ancient Mayan civilization, seeing full body tattoos, body art, multiple piercing and jewelryÂ It is a very exciting motion picture to look at, so strange to watchÂ It has the esthetic that began to appeal and it fills you with wonderÂ   Our hero Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood) is a cunning hunter whose father requests him not to tell of what he saw in forest todayÂ He is warned to strike fear from his heart and not to bring it into the villageÂHis wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez) is pregnant, and their small son, Turtles Run (Carlos Emilio Baez), live modestly in a village surrounded by a tranquil rain forest...   After a night of frivolity, the peaceful existence of this small community of hunters collapses when savage outsiders begin torching and burning everything in sight killing most and taking away dozens leftÂ   Going undetected, Jaguar Paw hides his wife and child in a deep, waterless well promising to return when the attack has passedÂ However when he is captured by his fearsome aggressors, he is tied to a pole and marched with his friends and fellow villagers to a forsaken land, stone-built, where the earth bleedsÂ   A fortuitous switch provides Jaguar Paw with an unexpected opportunity to escape and get back to his family in perilÂ But for that he has to make his way home through a killing field and a dangerous jungle, racing against sadistic captors hot on his trailÂ   "Apocalypto" transports the viewers to a strange and unreachable world, to a civilization in decline, to an infernal vision of a city and its inhabitants, to shocking images of human barbarism which has always existed throughout the agesÂ
The movie belongs in the action section when it goes to video.
But when they see the dark side of what that really means they can't handle it.
but tends to sag when Armand meets his ex-wife in her office and they do a little song and dance routine.
Of course the story climaxes in the dinner party scene when the two families come together in the apartment above the Birdcage Night Club.
There is little talking, or, more precisely, dubbing, as people never look at the camera when they talk, which is quite annoying at times.
This society is apparently bent on upholding traditions with no regard for the differences in individuals: Meursault is often emotionless when society expects him to be most emotional.
Meursault and his mother's relationship had actually ended on good terms when she was alive and there was no reason for him to heap honors on her when she could no longer benefit from them.
It's logical: why should he change things when they are going well already?
In fact he gets most emotional when he runs across his opposite: a man who is so caught up in conformity that he is little more than a shadow of a man.
Too bad it's not available on VHS or DVD, when I first saw this film years ago I was blown away , the mood it evokes is totally what living life day to day is all about , pure existentialism, my father was one and I have some of that in me , so I totally got it , Life is but a fleeting moment by moment .Existentialist ,Camus was one along with Sartre it's the same day everyday ,only we ,measure our own decay with the man made notion of time.Based on Camus's novel This film will either impress you or bore you.But then again it all depends on how you look at life.
This film is an unrecognized and almost forgotten example of what an overrated "auteur" can do when budget limitations and a combination of good casting and a talented crew come together in a highly serious attempt at adapting a great novel.
But as all the main characters are fairly reprehensible it had no emotional impact at all, it sort of went "phut" at the end when I think I was supposed to be devasted or something.
It gets more bizarre when Jeffrey's wife, Elaine (Patricia Clarkson), becomes obsessed with Robert.
I loved the writing and thought it was a very intelligent representation of what can go wrong when human lust and emotions get out of control.
The plot of the would-be movie, also called "The Dying Gaul," concerns a gay couple and what happens when one of them is faced with AIDS.
And, when you get right down to it, the plot of this film itself doesn't really have to be about Hollywood, screen writing, homosexuality, AIDS, infidelity or betrayal.
Each are painted as being capable of killing, but when death finally takes a role in the story it is left frustrating unclear whether a murder was even committed.
So when the film at first appears to be about the integrity of gay fiction -- compromising orientation and honesty to pander to a straight public -- there is a promise of THE DYING GAUL being a story of substance.
But that quickly evaporates when the ineffectual Robert far too easily sells out his values -- literary and sexual -- to the charming and pragmatic bisexual Jeffrey.
Ialmost want to insert trumpets when they stampede the offending group, back ends kicking up.
And when they run...it is just HILARIOUS.
But when it goes to the bad it does so in a big way.
She later meets him for a night out at the movies, and she and Robert have the kind of chat that happens when two women are sharing innermost secrets.
His use of Steve Reich's music is stunning, and perfectly counterpoints the plot turns, as well as sounds per se -- like when Elaine discovers her husband's secret and a hose goes off, or the shrieks of the Tishop children at the beginning, bookended by something horrible at the end.
Where the story somehow loses a little of its initial punch is when Elaine takes her online act further as "Arckangel1966".
But thankfully we live in an age when great movies can find an audience on home video -- and I predict that's what will happen here.
In a time when being gay is mostly viewed as a normal part of our societal fabric (current Administration and Red States notwithstanding)this film seems to me to elude the "gay film" classification.
Over time, Robert and Elaine become friends, which sets up a triangular relationship that careens out of control when the anonymity of internet chat rooms provides cover for the discovery of secrets.
The back and forth exchange here is unusual, and striking in that it is meaningless when taken out of context, but highly enlightening when considered in relation to the film's plot, as this sample shows: "Hello"; "I hear clicking"; "I'm still here"; "Are you still there?
Or when one of the characters admits to being bisexual... HELLO, YA THINK??
But at the same time, prepare to cringe when Sarsgaard screams like a little girl during his orgasm.
He intends to use part of it for the education of his son, who he had when married to a woman.
Soon Robert is introduced to Elaine, when they go a screening of one of Jeffery's movies.
And this in a year when films such as 'Brokeback Mountain', 'Transamerica', and 'Capote' drew focus.
But, when his defense attorney (Bai Ling) unearths puzzling contradictions in the case, she acts against the court and her country, joining him in a pulse-pounding race to find the true killerÂ while both of their lives hang in the balance!"
The film's visual extravagance is serviced magnificently by the format; the major set-pieces bookending the film are nothing short of spectacular when witnessed like this.
Richard Gere gets infatuated with the wrong woman, & when he wakes up, she is dead.
The film very carefully and cautiously tries to show us how the mind of a person can open little by little when confronted to real life if that person is simply honest with himself or herself, with his or her own principles, with his or her conception of justice.
That is when our hero came in â Beowulf.
And in fact, it helps to be experienced in China living when watching Red Corner, for much of its deeper mannerisms only become apparent if you know how and when to look for them.
For example, Richard Gere (as subtle and low-key as usual) portrays Jack Moore, a US-based business person willing to forego ideals and politics in order to enter the much vaunted mainland market, hyped up to be the best thing since instant noodles, when in fact like everything in life, it too comes at a price.
As of 2005, companies like Microsoft and HP openly pursue a policy of appeasement when it comes to China, willingly accepting political strings attached to what are supposed to be mere commercial activities.
Overall, an underrated film and unjustly criticized by the national critics, most of whom don't like it when communism is bashed.
Any hope of investment in a plot evaporated when we noticed that the license plates all said "Vermont" and not, say, Colorado or Arizona, which actually have Diamondback Rattlers within their borders.
Instantly the movie kicks into action when Grendel shows up.
And when everyone's standing around running their yaps while a character they supposedly all care about lies suffering from snakebite--EVEN WHEN AN AMBULANCE IS WAITING TO TAKE HIM AWAY FOR TREATMENT--well...shoot.
I was incredulous when I saw that it was done in 2004.
I'm trying to figure out how two kids on bicycles could (almost) out race the landslide when a bunch of cars didn't have a chance in hell.
The premise of the film is a good one...girl gets her jollies from stealing stuff, and she ends up in a bit of trouble when a security officer notices her.
He's trying to go straight and start his own security agency, when he's not trying to get into Emily's pants.
Nick Diaz' story is nothing but a string of clichÃ©s interrupted only by moments when the Almighty Plot Hammer blatantly pushes the story along.
Claude Lelouch was at the top of his career when he conceived this immensely satisfying thriller.
The most amusing scene happens when Simon is being interrogated by the police and the inspector tells Simon about a "man and a woman" and Simon, without missing a beat begins to sing the music from the real "A Man and a Woman", a film by Mr. Lelouch, where the same actor, Jean-Louis Trintignant appeared.
His camera angles, especially when the inspector is interrogating the Galloises after their son has been kidnapped, he shows the couple on both sides of the police, of whom we only see the back of his head.
I just saw it this week after not seeing it since the 70's, and the film stands the test of time marvelously -- still as fresh, funny, and involving as when I saw it originally.
You may be thrown a bit (as was I) when characters are doing things out of character, not realizing it's a flashback, but that only adds to the experience- I'd rather be confused for a few minutes than have some obvious corny announcement that a flashback is coming, like squiggly dream lines appearing on screen.
It never achieves "suspension of disbelief" which is crucial in a movie, so it mostly falls on its face when it comes to really grabbing you, and that's a shame since it easily could have been so much better.
I have seen most of Christopher Lamberts movies and this movie called Fortress has to be one of his best movies he has ever done.There are heaps of great action scenes in this movie and the most memorable scenes are the scenes in the end of the movie when Christopher Lamberts Character and his friends are trying to escape the prison and Christopher is shooting all of the prison guards to escape.
I finally figured out how to enjoy this movie when I realized it was a cross between a cheesy bodice-ripper romance novel and an Eddie Izzard routine.
Although, Angelina Jolie is always pleasant to look at when scantily clad.
(Lustlimb is how one Beowulf's men refers to his penis when he's chatting up the local serving wench.)
Most of them may be cheezy or even bad, but when I go to the video store and I see a new Lambert box sitting on the shelf I get excited.
That way when guys like me go to the video store and we're not in the mood for some hollywood bullsh*t, and we've rented every horror movie on the shelves a hundred times, and there hasn't been a new Bruce Campbell "straight to video" classic released in ages, we can pick up one (or all) of the seven Christopher Lambert videos that have come out that week and know that our weekend is not going to be a complete waste!
The premise of a society with boundaries on conception is not a new one, infact at the time when this film was released, China was very much in the news for limiting couples to one child only.
And things drag a bit when the Thief starts romancing the princess.
This is exactly the sort of story Chaplin had in mind when he worried that talk in movies might turn out to be a handicap.
I found the original FIST OF THE NORTH incredibly moving when I first saw it.
The fantastical tone also makes acceptable the pantomime acting, such as the exaggerated yawn and stretch of the guard falling asleep, or Fairbanks's palms literally itching when he spies a precious jewel.
The lack of color added to the overall darkness of the film due to lack of lighting also is a deterrent to watching these very, very old films that were made when my grandparents were infants (literally).
If you are not a fan of old movies, you really have to keep those things in mind when watching "The Thief of Baghdad" for the first time.
The story really begins, though, when the thief disguises himself as a prince, and attempts to woo the princess.
This is the type of film that should be pulled out when someone wants to do a theater organ score with a silent movie.
A noble, nice-looking (sorry, I had to add that in), young thief named Ahmed who sneaks into the palace (with the help of a magic rope) and tries to steal, but changes his ways when he falls for the Caliph's daughter.
His true identity is revealed when one of the Mongol slaves he "ran into" tells the Mongol prince who he [the thief] really is.
He has so much charm, and moves so fluidly, that he captivates even when the special effects are, well, very 1920s.
A lot of moments would be right at home in a big-budget kung-fu movie, like when he takes the royal ring and cuts it in half with his sword (in a modern movie, we would see the ring float in mid-air as his sword slices through it in slow motion).
All that is thrown asunder when Mr. Fairbanks lays his eyes on veiled, but pretty Julanne Johnson (as "The Princess").
And why does it take so long for the Thief to ride to the rescue when the Evil Mongol Prince has taken over Bagdad when he could have flown there on Pegasus, the Winged Horse?
He has so much charm, and moves so fluidly, that he captivates even when the special effects are, well, very 1920s.
Don't you hate it when you search for a video of a band online and all you get is a twenty second clip taken from a cell phone video camera?
I don't know when the performance was shot, or where, or who the musicians are, or what their influences were.
I'd guess the audio, which is a mixture of live tapes and commercially available records, was dubbed on later when the film makers had cut their footage together.
Of the 3, only "The Curse of Dracula" completed its story (Although when the series first aired, It was already on Chapter VI (But then, none of the three started on its first chapter).
However, Mary soon falls under his spell when Dracula falls for her and gives her one of his special hickeys.
In the scene when he and Mary are stargazing and he expresses his love for her, you can't help but feel his loneliness.
No wonder, when offered the choice to join him, that Mary took his hand and threw caution to the (literal)wind.
Who thought that Lucy's tired old schtick when she couldn't get Liz Taylor's ring off her hand (yes, folks, it was the hand-behind-the-curtain bit, older than moon rocks but only half as funny) was anything other than wince inducing?
Some of us teens thought Lucie Arnez was pretty attractive when we saw her.
I was a mere child when "Here's Lucy" aired first run on television and I loved it.
I never saw "I love Lucy" (A few years later when I entered grade school and would come home for lunch, it would be on in repeats and that's where my interest for that show came in!)
Other things to nitpick at: the allusions to Christianity seemed out of place most of the time as I didn't understand what they could contribute to the plot (maybe atmosphere), the gory scenes that might look great on 3D, but just left me nauseated (a tip,less is sometimes more), but not when involving Beowulf's striptease nudity (I thought it was real cold up North, but go figure).
I was really excited last year when I heard that a Beowulf movie was actually going to be released in theaters!
The definite sidesplitting sick highlight occurs when Lilith's vampire harem gets slaughtered while "Ballroom Blitz" blares away on the soundtrack.
Especially when Miller and Sarandon are destroying Vampires with Supersoakers.
This disappearance of local young men hits close to home for Katherine Verdoux(Erika Eleniak) when her rebellious younger brother Caleb (Corey Feldman) goes missing.
I liked when he goes to the "Cunningham wake," and watches as the men lift the coffin out of the room, but struggle with it.
My favorite scenes are the Super Soaker scene (I won't divulge on this too much, not to spoil it, but it is a classic scene not to me missed), the scene where he sneaks back into the mortuary to investigate, and when Rafe heads into the coffin drop to visit the Bordello.
If you rent a Tales From The Crypt movie, don't expect something very good... but I was a little dissapointed when I saw this, because I think Demon Knight is about one of the best horrors made, and I was surprised that their second film was far different than Demon Knight...
The humour in this feature comes very unexpectedly (like those "bugs") but when it comes, it is so childishly spontaneous.
And "when sorrows come, they come not single spies but in battalions" - the drama here rivals the best Shakespearean tragedies.
Back then when I thought I recorded over it, I was very devastated.
Keiichi Morisato, one day, called the Goddess services by accident when he was ordering something to eat.
It starts out with Keichi Morisato, who decides to order some lunch, but accidentally dials the Goddess-help-hotline but when he tries to tell them it was a mistake, and all of a sudden Belldandy comes out of nowhere!
His mother Florence 'Rusty' Dennis (Cannes Film Festival winner, and Golden Globe nominated Cher) is one of the problems in his life, she is a no nonsense mother with a drug habit and prostitution that sometimes stops him getting anywhere and can cause arguments, but he is happy when she is tender, protective and hanging out with her true love and good friend, Gar (Sam Elliott).
The Rocky Dennis story is sad, but the courage of this boy impress you, and make you think about how stupid people are when they take an opinion about others paying attention only to their physical features.
It was great when Rocky told that teen that he would "take off his mask, until he takes off his".
You know it's happening, but the scene when his mom goes into his room and finds him dead in bed still can't help but put a few tears in your eyes.
For example, when the school principal who recommended that her deformed son be placed in a "special" school and how she told him off to his face that he will thrive with the normal students and threatened to sue him, shows that her love for her son will always be first before her.
There is a scene that always touches me- when Rocky is looking in a fun house mirror.
I saw this movie when i was 15. it just absolutely blew me away.
i have always considered myself an outsider,but when i was 14 my step dad came into my life and took me as his son despite my flaws,much like gar did with rocky.
It was difficult to watch when it first came out.
Beautiful movie from a true master Peter Bogdanovich.Truly warm movie about a boy Rocky who has a rare disease so people often think he's wearing a mask.But he was lucky because he had a family.Maybe not kind of family we all think about when we hear that word,but he had a true family who loved him till the end.His family was mother,drug addict and bunch of bikers.All of them saw something in Rocky and that something was his inside and not outside.Story is very good and you can relate it to any other story from todays life.This isn't just a story about boy with weird face,it's a story about whole society,family and mostly about people.What is really important to us people?How we look from the outside or from the inside.Only girl who connected with Rocky was a blind girl.Isn' that tragic how we,people have wrong priorities in life.Excellent movie that really touched me and also some great performance from Eric Stoltz,Cher and Sam Elliott.All time story with great directing and good acting.
Grendel's mother was only supposed to kill one man when she comes to Herot, not all of Beowulf's men.
It opens in L.A. just about when it is getting dark and ends in Helsinki at dawn.
So, the awaken watcher is not too astonished, when the sober taxi driver is called Mika and the deathly drunk passenger Aki.
It's four in the morning when he kicks the two guys out, and then he sees a blind woman on the side looking for a taxi.
He picks her up, expecting her to not give him "any chit", but this notion instantly shatters when she acts whorish to him.
A few things happen: They grab the taxi driver by the throat, they moan about their passed-out friend and how bad his life is, then end up in tears when the taxi driver explains how his life is far worse than that of the passed-out guys.
Night on Earth... Just another picture that you didn't plan to see, but you just couldn't stop watching when you got to see on your TV set.
The poem has been dechristianized: On the one hand, it does take out a glaring anachronism (the action of the poem takes place during the Migration Period of the AD 400s-500s, when they would still be following the traditions of the Aesir religion, but the poem was written down in a very Christianized context in England, and the anachronism does add a richness to the language) The only sop to the underpinnings of the source material come in a discussion between two urinating Danes over the relative merits of Christianity and Aesir-worship, and later when Unferth suggests praying to Christ as well as Odin, a suggestion that Hrothgar rejects out of hand (perhaps a reference to the opposite situation in the poem, where the Danes throw off Christianity for a time, hoping that the old gods will smite Grendel where the Christian ones had apparently failed).
Ray Winston obviously is not the first actor who comes to mind when playing an ancient warrior.
However when you see the movie and see the performance you understand why Winstone was cast.
But her few scenes stick firmly in memory, and her entry scene is one of the most beautifully pieces of cinema I have seen when watched in 3-D. Crispin Glover too has brief screen time as Grendell, but he delivers a heartfelt performance, in fact I felt genuine sympathy with Grendell.
After they filmmaker get over the gimmick of chucking things at the screen the 3-D is used less prominently, until any action sequences, and when the action sequences begin I doubt you will draw a single breath.
It's different from most Jarmusch films because it's filmed in color, when most Jarmusch fans would prefer black and white.
About the film: well my favorite story is the one with Roberto Benigni that takes place in Rome, the reason is Benigni, because for me this is the funniest performance of Benigni and well the story is great, the part when Benigni tell his story about the sheep is just very funny and of course the other five stories are great.
Honestly, when I saw the first minutes of this movie I thought: `O dear, I'm going to fall asleep!'
I actually tried to see Thelma and Louise at the cinema when Night on Earth came out, but as it was sold out, I saw this instead - what a lucky break!
Maybe it's because scenes like these usually wouldn't make it into 'mainstream' fare, but a sequence like this showcases some great dialog on both sides (and when Rosie Perez comes in, all bets are off).
And all of this is accentuated by a carefully controlled mis en scene of driving (which is always visually endearing), where right when you're expecting there to be a cut it waits one or two extra seconds.
It's great northern European mythology, and mandatory reading when you are young in my opinion (Along with Norse, Greek and Roman Mythology as well).
Polar was beautifully modeled after Chris Van Allsburg illustrations for his book, but Zemeckis' adaptation to the story went a little over the top when it became a musical.
Also, to add to this, when you have CGI characters like Jacksons Gollum and King Kong to compare notes with, the modeling here just isn't up to snuff.
His helplessness when trying to communicate with his passenger, played by Giancarlo Esposito, almost becomes tangible when it manifests in his complete inability to steer the taxi.
His methods are amusing though; the best being the the pop-up barrier he installs in the road, of course it doesn't work when the Roadrunner goes past but a few minutes when Coyote is using "Acme Triple-Strength Fortified Leg Muscle Vitamins" which enable him to run so fast he literally sets the road on fire this barrier springs up just in time for him to run into it.
I know this is an animated movie,where the animals talk and not a documentary.But I wonder if maybe it was made in response to it.I saw this on cable a long time ago,when I was 10.The movie is about a little fox cub,named Vuk, who decides to wander off from the safety of his den.He lives with both his mom and dad,and shares the den with many young,sleepy siblings.Before he even returns home though,he is greeted by his uncle,who has some unsettling news.While he was gone,an evil farmer and his two stupid mongrels killed his entire family.His uncle helps raise him,and they have some fun and exciting adventures.Later on when he is grown up,he and his uncle rescue a vixen named Panny from a cage.The farmer had caught her and put her in there to kill her,or trap Vuk and other male foxes.
However, it is hard to comply when we are asked to feel or identify with these characters after so many scenes presenting them as mere caricatures.
In case of movies that were commented by a lot of users, it might work, but to give 5.8 for this movie when out of 40 votes (at present) only 3 was below seven, and 42% voted this movie 10, it is really not working.
just got my 2 disc anthropophagus DVD in the mail the other day put out by those awesome folks at shriek show.this movie could have used a couple more gory killing in it but i'm not going to complain to much and what there is for gore in this Italian classic is pretty bloody and gory.george eastman is perfectly cast as the mad cannibal who stalks a boatload of tourists on an island.i am a huge fan of joe d'amato so when this came out i threw my old bootleg in the garbage.disc two has a sixty seven minute documentary and interview with d'amato so just that is reason enough to buy this DVD..so if you are a fan of gory and cheesy Italian horror buy this right away
So good that someone claimed, when the movie was on theaters, that the scene with the fetus was a snuff!
This has a decent air of foreboding and is quite nasty in parts, especially the parts that editors didn't want you to see back in the days when it was considered "tasteless" or "too brutal".
Angelina Jolie's animated self spends all her on screen time walking around without any clothes on, something that apparently gave Jolie a blush when she saw a cut of the movie.
The first is the one in which our psychotic monster rips an unborn fetus out of the belly of a woman and starts to eat it, while the dying husband is watching and the second one is the ending when the killer is starting to eat his own intestines after being stabbed in the belly.
In the beginning of the film we are quickly treated to one of the better moments when a male victim laying on a beach receives a hatchet to the face.
It's frustrating to say the least, when watching a horror movie, if the "Bad Guy" does not even appear ONCE during the first hour.
To be honest I found the goriest scene in the whole film to be when a girl victim is lifted through a hole in the roof by her neck.
I saw this film (uncut) straight after Absurd and kept wondering when it was actually going to start - there is one initial scene where a guy on a beach gets a meat cleaver through his head (extremely unrealistic effects) and then the next "excuse of gore" is a head in a bucket which is so pathetically unreal I nearly split my sides with laughter !!!!
It could be considered somewhat boring the first part of the movie, but the only time I think of that is when I watch it with friends, and they say "isn't anything going to happen?
He's about to murder one when the other comes along and kills him with a pitchfork.
I, for one, lost control of my jaw when I initially saw this.
Wile the opening third is laboriously slow and drawn out, the story fortunately picks up steam and really starts cooking when the boat passengers reach the island: The island location projects a profoundly unsettling feeling of isolation and vulnerability, the cannibal's filthy corpse-strewn underground lair is a truly scary place, and, of course, the moments of intense hardcore splatter deliver the disgusting goods (stomach-churning highlights include a meat cleaver to the face, a severed head in a bucket, a couple of torn out jugular veins gushing blood, the infamous fetus eating scene, and the gloriously gruesome climax with the cannibal munching on his own intestines).
Turns out the island is nearly uninhabited, and when the vacationers get stranded there - they start to piece together what happened to the original inhabitants of the island.
The anticipation was killing me and when I saw the 2 disc uncut edition for 10 bucks I had to get it.
The Uncut version has raised controversy mainly because of two gruesome sequences including the cannibal eating a woman's fetus and the later being his demise when he tries to eat his own guts after being slaughtered.
But when they get there, the local town is deserted, and there are no real clues as to what happened.
It was never frightening and some effects are really poorly done as the head in the bucket and the death of the blind girl, when they zoom in on her you still can see her breath.
This is the only Joe D'Amato film I have seen without it's trademark explicit sexual content,but this does not mean it is not as extreme as,let say,"Emanuelle in America".A group of tourists arrive on a Greek island,without knowing it is inhabited by a demented,cannibalistic killer.The movie contain some graphic and very disturbing murders,especially in the last minutes,when the maniac eats a fetus and then devours himself.Add a good dose of suspense,great make-up for George Eastman and ,surprisingly,a very sad story behind his character.So,if you want to see a truly horror classic I recommend "Anthropophagus",even for those with a weak stomach.
But when I found a copy of Anthropophagus, I couldn't pass up the opportunity.
The horror starts in the opening scene, when two teenagers on a beach are killed in a very gory fashion.
As night falls, the group soon fears that something horrible is happening, and they begin to panic when a pregnant Maggie goes missing.
They decide to search the house they're staying in when they find Rita, a blind girl who is a friend of Julie's.
She says something has killed everyone on the island except her, because she is the only one who can sense when the killer is coming and is able to hide.
Later, when Carol finds Julie and Daniel kissing, she runs off and locks Julie in a cemetery, while all but Rita and Daniel go to find her.
His impact to the film, when he does arrive, is immediately felt when Eastman's fiend bites a plug of skin from the neck of a victim.
He'll also bite a chunk of flesh from a throat later in the film when he pulls a victim's face through the hole of a mansion's ceiling.
I think the film's finest moments occur when Massaccesi shoots the use of candle-light at night through the darkened rooms of the French couple's home with Julie and Bodin's Daniel encountering a frightened innocent hiding from Eastman's monster, and specifically the Roman catacombs where Eastman's lair of eaten bodies is located(..this is very akin to the work of Lucio Fulci with the presence of remains, corpses, skulls, bones & red-eyed rats running about).
But, I think it can be sensed, here, that when inspired, Massaccesi can create a sense of atmosphere.
The eyes were static throughout and it is the little details that make the difference when trying to make something as uber-realistic as this, such as the fact that the pupils didn't react to light.
For me the most disappointing part of the film was actually Ray Winstone as the titular character - he was fantastic when talking in a low growl, however the film really suffers when he shouts in full cockney accent.
A group of young adults go to a Greek island, where things go from bad to worse when they find that everyone on the island -- with the exception of a blind girl -- has been killed.
This film has floated around under various names -- "Grim Repaer", "Man Eater" and the misspelled "Antropophagus" to name a few -- for quite some time, gaining notoriety for its banned status in England and two scenes which had to be cut when it was finally released (one involving a man eating his own intestines and the other with a baby being ripped from a womb and devoured).
Eastman, when he gets to really shine towards the end makes for a truly vicious and maniacal adversary but ingeniously, is slightly more shaded a character than your average murderous terror, giving a whole lot more interest and even an odd sort of sympathy.
Also on the Other question,is there going to be anymore seasons/newer shows coming out?.i never saw past the show when Harrison made that request Wishing he was never born..because it started from the whole thing again.
I used to watch this show ages ago when I was like twelve and now I'm eighteen and watching it again, because it's really good and I adore it.
I watched this show when I was much younger, 10 or maybe 11.
I really believe I'm a better person for watching this show when I was young - that may be a bit deplorable but there you go.
Yet when the bandages are revealed, she's exactly the same - except brunette.
I think you just have to be able to know when to take it seriously and when to laugh - take note previous reviewer!
This is one of the few programs I have ever seen that managed to balance outright slapstick comedy with serious drama...and it did it so well in my opinion that I seriously mourned the loss of the show when it was canceled.
The only way to describe the quality of this film is that this is the kind of movie they show on Saturday afternoons when the football game is pre-empted.
Things go awry for the Captain however when a portion of her assembled crew lead by her former lover, a cutthroat type named Vendler, double-crosses her and looks to gain the valuable Solarium aboard the ship for himself.
Where this falters is when our story changes its focus to J.T.
It appears that her part was filmed later and edited in, as she never interacts with the other actors and the "hacker" uses male pronouns when referring to her and her image.
The videotape version would be best, since you probably will be able to celebrate when the VCR decides to eat it.
I have seen this film but it was many years ago, when myself and a friend used to rent videos from the local store and there were certain ones we would rent again and again.
I do like it when Jonathan cries after having to kill his brother.
Their hopes are heightened however, when Pascal offers to send Louis Prima and his band to their restaurant - a sure fire way to drum up business.
As for me, I normally prefer "I Paliacci" or "Turandot" when I am attempting my Risotto or Lasagne Bolognese but I think I will pull out my Louis Prima albums the next time I cook.
Many scenes are rich in emotion, even when the characters have no dialogue.
But the film, though sweet, also establishes an undertone of such mournfulness that the viewer is not surprised when Prima never shows up, in fact, was never going to show up; it was a brutal trick by Pascal, who recognizes the brothers' abilities, so that they would be forced to close the restaurant and, he hopes, go to work for him.
He is offered an opportunity to show off his talents when the competitor offers an invitiation to Louis Prima to come to the enjoy the food of the great chef.
Their restaurant will become famous when its mentioned in the paper so the two brothers plan a big night with special meals.
Even when they argue it is done with mutual respect.
Janney adds just the right touch as Ann and you can understand the awe that she feels when she watches Primo at work and can witness his skill first hand.
Sorry to disappoint all those who were trying to find some deep, intentional meaning in the choice of two actresses for the same role, but if Fernando Rey is to be believed, here's what he told me when I bumped into him at a party in the early 90's: he said that he and BuÃ±uel liked both actresses for the part, couldn't decide which one to use, so they used them both.
The mixture of experienced and young actors do a good job with believable performances, they look and act real, even when things seem to go absurd for a while.
And the last words...It's 9/10 and It's not 10/10 because of its ending...It gives real good advices to the life but when the film finishes you leave the theater with some questions in your mind but maybe there is coming a second film and I may change my mind to 10/10 after seeing the conclusion.
Chaplin expects certain gratuities for standing up for her, and when none are forthcoming, he too absconds with her goods.
It's really quick and hilarious in spots, and couple of moments had me rolling with laughter, like the random moment as the one rich man (not Matthieu, of course) is about to leave for the bank, but when his driver starts the car it explodes!
Or when Matthieu comes to find another piece of Conchita's seemingly precious demeanor stripped away when he finds out how she 'really' makes her money in the small town, which is actually funnier not even because of her in the scene but for who she's dancing for.
Filled with uncomfortably funny, sad and jarring moments, and enough notes on what it means to hold on to one's sexual parts (or not) with one's partner to ignite an entire women's studies course for a semester at a college, it's a work from Bunuel I was glad to see again, to see more into the layers he places in it and to find that even when it's not meaning to it's quite the funny affair- and quite the way to make a final bow on an extraordinary career.
This, unfortunately, produces little humor when compared to other kidnapping comedies like "Rutless People," "The Crazy Sitter," or "The Ref," for example.
He was also correct that the armed forces would depend on air power, a fact the armed forces ignored until nearly 1939 when Hitler proved what a modern air force could do.
Williams is obviously using it to symbolize that he is, in fact, hiding something from his life-partner, and that "something" is Rodrigo- note his eyes when he communicates with the waiter in the restaurant scene.
The cross-examination scene, where he goads and scorns Cooper mercilessly, is one of those very rare moments in cinema when a performance holds the screen and burns itself into your memory.
A wonderful film, and I thought a strong performance by Cooper (almost especially when he appeared weak and beaten.)
Gary Cooper was only a few years older than Billy Mitchell when he chose to publicly criticize the existing services and invite a court martial and fits the part as right as he did when playing Lou Gehrig.
America would not have a separate Air Force until 1947 when the Army and Navy were put under one Department of Defense and an Air Force created from those members of the Army Air Corps who wished to join.
As for whether the court-martial did what it intended to do, obviously it did not in Pearl Harbor's case, however, it may have helped development of better aircraft and aircraft carriers during the 30's, especially when one considers this was during a depression.
So when the zeppelin crossed into the storm front, the zeppelin was ripped apart by the winds and crashed killing Landsdowne and fourteen men.
And this leads to the dramatic high point, when Cooper is cross-examined by the malicious and clever Rod Steiger.
An early pilot in the U.S. Army's fledgling Air Corps, he served in World War I when no American-produced plane saw action above the trenches of France.
So when the footage of the first flight around 31 of mars 1903 came, I thought; "Wow, is this for real, is what I was thought in school just bull"... Then I remembered that the documentary was made in 1995, and this I would have heard of...
I remember watching this movie on TV when they first showed it in Sweden, I think it was in 2002.
Ambarassing at first, then, when I saw that it was a Peter Jackson movie, I could only laugh.
Eventually, when it was aired in 1995, everyone thought it was a sensation.
I understand this movie, when it aired on New Zeeland television, caused quite the commotion for being "false-thruth" proving how easily people can be misled by a convincing presentation and a documentary format.
I have even seen worse examples here in Sweden  Though one factual error actually caught my attention, when Colin is filming the first airplane flight they use "digital-enhancement" to check the date on the mans newspaper.
At first I thought Forgotten Silver was a joke, but I changed my mind when I saw that one of the greatest of contemporary film historians and critics, Leonard Maltin, had contributed his insights to the story of film pioneer Colin McKenzie.
I first saw MOST of this film on a flight from New Zealand to Australia, but missed the ending when the flight ended before the film.
I admire Jackson for unearthing this silent movie master (which actually I knew about before this movie came out), and await when Salome comes out on DVD!
In fact, when it first screened in NZ it caused an uproar because it was assumed to be fact.
Really, the whole thing is just so far fetched, yet that is the film's great achievement because when you watch it, you actually believe it (at least I did!)
It was only the next day, after bemusedly watching a workmate fold over laughing when I related the latest proof that a kiwi had beaten the Wright brothers to it and demanding explanation, that I discovered the whole thing was a complete fabrication.
He was also the pioneer in color film, because he went to Tahiti to get some special berries that could be used in the creation of color, and when he was using the resulting film to capture images, topless and curious Tahitian women wandered into the picture, resulting in his arrest for portraying smut on film.
Swindle it may be, but nevertheless from the opening scene when Peter Jackson tells about his amazing discovery of Colin McKenzie's lost film footage to that last picture of McKenzie filming himself using a mirror "Forgotten silver" is a terrific and fascinating story and truly a first-rate documentary.
It's no wonder so many people were sucked into believing it when it first screened - the Colin McKenzie saga has an emotional depth which is heartbreaking.
This is the only scene that was cut from the film and when you consider what is in other films it is difficult to understand why, I think the main reason was to obtain a younger certificate for the film.
A woman who is really two who is the embodiment of repulsion and desire even when she herself is a prisoner of her own need for teasing -- what better way to have two woman play one?
While the cool, reserved, and near frigid Bouquet balances one side of the woman, the more emotional and girlish Molina pirouettes on the other, and in the middle, poor Mathieu (for once, a very sympathetic Fernando Rey), caught in his own struggle, telling his story, unable to go even when he (justifiably) beats her at the height of his rage.
Music is a universal language that binds people, so when contempt is shown by the Iranian border guards, it has a powerful effect on the audience.
What a bore this film was , why is it that when Australians make films about grotty dirty people with no zest for life and basically are dull , people stand and praise these films.
The only other people in the audience were a noisy couple in front of me who came to see it for its Scrabble sub-text and when bored otherwise kept stretching their arms up right in front of my face.
You realize going in that this film will not turn into yer basic "and-they-lived-happily-ever-after" number, so we're not surprised when -=- MINOR SPOILER -=- Gordo finally has had enough; this damsel of the deranged has literally drained him dry and he has to cut her loose.
The most poignant part of the movie, for me, takes place at the end, when, quite simply, Cynthia isn't there anymore, and we feel her absence just as profoundly as Gordon does.
A must see if you like Bergman films: I was a thoroughly depressed individual when I walked out, and very happy to be one.
Unfortunately it came in a period when Kelly/Donen were setting a new standard for big production and very rapid pacing, so it was out of fashion and ignored.
There is a true 'honour' community amongst players, bowing to each other, not attacking when a guys sabre is deactivated (means I wish to talk) and other such courtesy.
I've never had so much fun when fragging.
The power of it, the deflection... in this game, their appearance closer resemble those of the new trilogy of films, at least in part due to the release of the first of them having been to the theaters when they were making it.
In this game, there is still an unmistakable requirement of skill, if nothing or nowhere else, then when you face multi-player foes that are superior, and possibly a boss enemy or two, as well.
It's always nice when something is pointed out on-screen that leads to mystery, but that mystery is never stated.
Multiplayer Saber physics are changed in the multiplayer mode, the saber fights are slowed down considerably due to the lag factor, you'll find out what I mean when you play it.
I saw a great review of this film a couple of weeks ago when it played in Portland and I thought I would give the film a go...
I was a little put off when I heard the director's name was Rusty Nails - a bit odd - but it didn't take long for the film to drag me into a very strange and creepy otherworld that unfortunately looked very much like the America we live in today.
I don't want to wreck too much of the plot - I hate when reviews do that.
The subject matter didn't bother me in the least and I can certainly appreciate inventiveness and shock value when done well.
I do not believe BuÃ±uel for a second when he claims that he intended to use one actress, but she quit unexpectedly after shooting several critical scenes.
Characters were not developed, there were only 7 or so zitheads when it said that they turn many into zitheads (7 is not many.
Watch it while you wrap the presents, and for a truly quixotic effect, watch it backwards when you unwrap them.
That makes each star on the flags, when these flags have stars, quite expensive.
And some invent a duty to remember, an obligation to keep in mind, even when we are two or three or more generations after the conflict and we do not have direct witnesses to speak of it any more, and their word is only their word modified by time, propaganda, celebrations and simply the desire to forget.
Sometimes you see a movie that opens a door into a fascinating topic, into subject matter that is completely new and original, and that was the case when I first saw "Flags of Our Fathers".
It was also one of the only movies I've seen where all (save 1) of the audience stayed for all of the credits and when the credits ended, there was a long, silent moment shared by all.
than anything concrete since I'm still pondering the film and wondering when I'll be able to see it again.
How they only matter for something that has been deemed great, yet this "great" thing can be, very ironically, routine and even disregarded when it actually happened.
The film pulls no punches when it comes to revealing this human riddle.
It clarifies, instructs and above all it inspires us when we realize that such films that reveal the horrible truth about war can not only be made but celebrated by growing numbers of audiences.
I nodded in agreement when it was mentioned a single photo taken during combat has the power to make or break a war.
At a time when the war chest is drained and the battle seemed to be drawn out longer than expected, you need public support to cough out funds and make donations to the manufacturing of arms.
It is the conflict, and the need to lie through their teeth, which makes it all the more a sorrowful struggle, especially when you have to deny a fellow brother his moment of recognition, and denying his family the need for closure.
This is shown very well when James Bradley is going through the box of his fathers possessions and pulls out an envelope with the Navy Cross stuffed in it.
Therefore it was with great curiosity when he announced that he would tell the story about the battle on the island of Iwo Jima, February 1945.
And we are unsettled when we realise in war, things don't always go to plan.
The scenes involving "the three" when they return home are heartbreaking.
Please don't leave when the lights go up.
What do you get when you cross an Academy Award winning director whose movies tend to follow the lives of individuals and their consequences of the violence around them, an award winning writer that deals with racism and the map of the human spirit and a producer that has a penchant for World War II history who is a master of telling epic stories on the widescreen canvas?
I've always felt that when you fictionalize a story about war, you dishonor the memory of so many people who have a compelling story to tell by choosing to make something up instead *cough*privateryan*cough*.
So when the story at hand aims to pose questions like "what does it mean to do the wrong things for the right reasons" and tries to debunk the popular myth of herodom, there's very little margin for error.
That is exactly what happens when Jet meets two massive blond twins schooled in martial arts.
One particularly amusing scene is when Jet walks into a police station to go after the bad guys.
This reminded me of a funny scene in Wayne's World when Wayne and Garth open a door and behind it there is a bunch of spies doing a bunch of spy things like climbing walls and fighting.
Sometimes when one version of Conchita walks through a door the other figure enters the next room.
Anyway, their assignment involves busting a drug kingpin, but everything goes horribly wrong when the crime lord is killed and Richard pins the fault on John.
But to compensate for this pace is an interesting relationship that forms when Bridget Fonda enters the picture.
Of course, there are the obligatory moments of cheesy dialogue when she says to him that all he cares about is himself, but the fight scenes kick in before any of this can significantly hinder the film.
This film's all about the action and I'm certainly not complaining when it comes to that.
Western directors MUST learn to pull back the camera and stop using those fast cut MTV style editing when it comes to shooting martial arts fight sequences.
The first rule of shooting a martial arts scene,especially when the actor is also a talented martial artist, is to pull the camera back and shoot it with a wide angle with longer takes and not to do so many close ups with excessively fast cutting of scenes to the point where the whole body cannot be seen and consequently the FUlL power, grace and the execution of the technique is lost to the audience.
Thanks to Luc Besson, the movie also gets Thierry Arbogast, who is a GREAT technician when it comes to creating the saturated atmosphere.
I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and aside from the car chase, I still get 'tingles' when watching the fight scene with the tall and short guys in the office, the soundtrack playing during this scene works very well with it.
Things go belly up when corrupt cops led by Insp.
Liu also becomes involved with a local American woman named Jessica (Bridget Fonda), who was forced into prostitution when Richard kidnapped her child.
The implication is not difficult to read, especially when we see Conchita's reaction, which is one of utter disgust.
I truly believe this is Jet Li's English coming out movie (too bad it was released in the summer when other bigger movies come out).
When his cohorts convince him to pull one last job, he finds himself in the dangerous realm of the powerful and wealthy Action/Adventure  Marcos DeSantos is a Robin Hood-type thief whose plans on retiring from the life of crime are halted when his partners Cole and Bianca convince him to return for one last score.
But the success of the heist is short lived when, in a stunning act of betrayal, Cole turns his gun on DeSantos, shooting him twice in the chest.
I wasn't expecting much when i watched this, maybe something like the dawn patrol.
I have heard that even Germany's greatest ace in WWI, the "Red Baron," was very disillusioned when he went home the last time before his death.
When his mother asked him who his friends were in a photo, he told her sadly when each of them had been killed.
Often when a classic movie is forgotten there is a good reason for it.
No longer able to feign callousness, he conceals his partner's corpse till the dawn mission, when he can set up an heroic battle death which is actually a double suicide--the eagle and the hawk going down together.
This inner turmoil continues throughout the film and climaxes when he is given yet another accolade.
His initial jubilation over this feat is crushed when he discovers that his observer has been killed.
Criminally underrated war picture details the adventures of a group of WWI volunteer pilots whose excitement turns to anguish and despair when they are confronted with the reality of combat.
Perhaps a bit too a head of it's time when originally released, THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK is a terrific film that is ripe for rediscovery.
Just when you thought it was safe to have a marriage, here comes yet another Lifetime "it's ok for women to cheat" yarn.
As for comments about when Dave should retire well I am sure that the man himself is shrewd enough to know when to bow out gracefully.
Even when he's talking to his house band we are rarely afforded a glance at who he is talking to, with a sinister high-pitched voice off camera underlining every sentence spoken by David: 'Oh!
Though I liked Tracey Needham, I was IMMENSELY disappointed when Monique left, and the role of Paige was recast with Tracey.
I rarely laugh or even smile when I watch this show, which is very seldom , but I keep hearing certain people not all, saying what a great show it is.
Even when there is nothing at all on TV it is still better than The Late Show.
What I think was my favorite guest he did was probably Madonna when she was cussing.
That is when I started to like it, since BB5 it has still been a great show.
However, it's always fun to get the full and unedited version when you're watching it live!
The only time I see nay of it is at 2 am when I look for a few minutes in disbelief that everyone is asleep and they insist on continuing to televise nothing happening.
I'm going to give the show a 2 because Imogen reacted when she was kicked out like I would have.
I laughed harder than when I saw "Young Frankenstein" for the first time years ago.
The fact that Robin Williams and Gene Hackman were cast seemed a bit strange to me when I first saw the names of the cast, but they were perfect for the characters they portrayed.
One of the most classic examples of the wit and genius performed in this film was when Diane Wiest looks at Gene Hackman when he's saying what a fine "lady" Nathan Lane is, and he's playing a Republican Senator!
Don't try to read anything into it that you may think was NOT intentional because it was ALL intentional with extremely dramatic performances, and you know that the cast had a great time making it.You can even see Robin Williams starting to crack up when his "male maid" (Agador) is trying to toss the shrimp into his stew concoction!
But sadly it was ruined when every chav, tart and odd mental patient signed up.
when it first started out in 2000, it was intended to last for one series and be a social experiment.
he said he killed his wife by accident when she was waiting outside.
i suggest you try it, and if you don't like it then fine, but don't prejudge it when you haven't seen it
With any luck it will one day be consigned to the same fate as 'The Black & White Minstrel Show' - unloved and forgotten, a relic of a shameful era when the lowest common denominator reigned supreme on British television.
"Celebrity" now is synonymous in describing those who have no talent at anything accept appearing on shows like BIG BROTHER.The amount of people who have earned a career,and a lucrative one at that,from this programme since it's debut has been astonishing.Brian Dowling and Kate Lawler are just two examples,but the most remarkable was that of Jade Goody,who didn't even win the series she appeared in.She came a cropper in 2007's CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER after her misguided behaviour towards Shilpa Shetty.Now having sadly passed away after a battle against cancer,it is arguable that unscrupulous media types exploited her naivety and inarticulacy (which was in no way particularly her fault) when she was not especially conscious of such events.
It seems not to matter,however,as others will take her equally dismal place as long as the top brass in British TV keep providing money to produce BIG BROTHER and it's various imitations.The house guests this year,if it really matters,consist mainly of young attractive women,with a few assorted males (apparently mostly homosexuals) added for the ride.But they seem as uninteresting,inarticulate,stupid,dull,self centered,unpleasant,egotistical and hopelessly fame seeking as most other house guests have been in previous years.It is the ultimate indictment that the most interesting parts of the programme are when we see everybody asleep in the house's bedroom!
This was a good portrayal of how young people fritter away their time chasing after their own useless future when they could be preparing for a better life.
The Series has gone Downhill since the Big-Brother the Experiment, when the Housemates slept with each other.
I know I'm not unveiling a sacrilegious revelation when I say this trash is edited and directed to the Nth degree.
And when something DOES actually happen (they call it 'Fight Night' as there is THE such night every year) the screens go black and we don't get to REALLY see what happened until Channel 4 okays it and edits their way around the truth.
Every Friday night is 'eviction night' in which the people of this once mighty and powerful land spend money phoning in who they want evicted from the house (and trust me, Channel 4 REALLY likes it when you phone many times in one night 'just to make sure').
The contestants on Big Brother are now all-to-aware that when they leave the house the spotlight will be on them.
The guy has that charisma and a body to back it up, even when the script gets a little bumpy.
I own the DVD of "A Better Way to Die" and I thought a lot of the film when I watched it.
She starts experiencing all kinds of emotions, when a mysterious stranger, who goes by the name of "Arnold Friend" (Treat Williams), decides to take advantage of the situation.
It's understandable to be fair game, but when you team with a killer who is also the target, you have no choice but to work together.
One of the most memorable scenes for me came when mother and daughter are in separate rooms of the house, but unbeknownst to each other are both privately dancing to the same song playing on the radio.
Some confusion in the script seems to have resulted in Novak's character turning sympathetic (to the audience) towards the end, sounding a disingenuous note (this kind of thing always smacks of studio interference when it concerns a new "star").
This movie was actually shown on PBS when it first came out, and many schools also utilize it in English class.
Now when I watched this movie, I was confused at first and thought about turning it off, but please stick with it, as all the confusion fades and you get a crystal clear picture of why everything happens like it does.
And some scene's had nothing to do with the movie, for example when one of the guys goes home with his girlfriend her sister opens the door, what we have next is nice to see but has nothing to do with the script, and a lot of girls show their body, clothed, in an explicit way.
None of these characters had any character development whatsoever and you didn't feel for them when they died...quickly.
I think this was the writer/directors way of making it longer, when they just damn right sucked.
He was definitely one of the finest actors that ever was and when he passed away, we lost a great talent.
Any non-readers considering viewing "Smooth Talk" would be wise to remember the source when reading negative comments from this group.
****SPOILERS**** Superior crime drama set in South Florida during it's "mean season" when the winds pick up and the storms and hurricanes come rolling in and with them rolls in a serial killer who's more interested in publicity for his crimes then his victims who are a result of them.
The much acclaimed film "Bullitt" has its famous chase scene well into the film, which makes it all the more satisfying when it arrives.
I'm so proud of myself, > like when the giant snail came up to me...).
Connie gets much more than what she bargains for, when the mysterious Arnold Friend keeps turning at the hamburger joint where she hangs out with Laura.
The look on Williams' face when Lane comes into the house when the visitors are there is priceless.
But when his achievement hits the news, it captures the attention of the mad Dr. Emilio Lizardo (John Lithgow), who catches the story on television from his room in the insane asylum, where he has been a resident for many years, ever since his own attempt at developing an overthruster failed.
He lumbers along like a mutated Quasimodo, and when he gives a speech to his fellow Red Lectroids about going `home,' it's one of the most hilarious scenes you're ever going to see anywhere.
Christopher Lloyd also turns in a winning performance as another of the Red Lectroids, `John Bigboote,' and his exchanges with Lithgow are a riot (especially when Lizardo insists on calling him `Big-Booty,' and Bigboote adamantly insists that it is pronounced `Bigboo-TAY!').
And finally, I originally saw this film when it was first released, in the Harvard Square cinema in Cambridge, Mass.
The super-car that breaks sound (and dimensional) barriers idles when the ignition is turned off... the test code for the oscillation overthruster jet car is a spelling variation of "signed, sealed, delivered"...
It's good to have a very strange sense of humor - otherwise, you just won't understand why it's funny when... well, you just won't get why the movie is funny at all!
I've seen much better historical "documentaries" when I was in grammar school.
Mean time the surviving traveller dies when her body is torn up and something escapes out of her.
I had been interested in seeing Xtro for a very long time, so naturally when Xtro 2 was coming on the Sci-Fi channel late on a Saturday night, I was more than exited to see it.
The monster looked kind of interesting at first, but when they finally showed it in its entirety it looked like a model with crappy lighting.
Jump 8 years into the future when this "sequel" was made and we have nothing more than "Alien" in an underground research facility.
Granted, the wait isn't that long time-wise, but when the film has an ugly set and little going for it in terms of acting or writing one can't help but want a rapid pace.
I've now seen it a couple of times, once when I was a lot younger (and it didn't impress me then) and again more recently and though I don't regret watching it, its hardly a good film.
So naturally, when I heard that this movie had a smartgun-like weapon in it, my response was, of course, "where can I find this movie?"
I was practically vibrating in my seat when I saw that thing fire.
I saw this movie for the first time when I was a young teenager, and I actually liked it.
So it must have been the creature, which looks reasonable (but still rubbery) and fairly dangerous when it shows its teeth, but it moves way too slow.
Â¿Where is Toxie when we need it?
My best moment is when the "Butte Police" character is at home and wastes some time in the sofa and stares around thinking of something to do.
Not sure if it could be called a "spoiler", but the ending of this movie, even right now when I think about it, has forever kept me in tears.
And even today, when ever I go to a pet store with dogs (even cats now), or when I went to a pound twice to get a new pet, I can not stay in there for long before my voice breaks and I start shedding tears.
How can one do this when literally every page of the book contains some new information, an unexpected development, an interesting dialog, or a crazy combination of all three?
The 1940 version takes you really back into the era of when the story is taking place and you can go there with the boys and their dog.
The dialogue was great and the characters believable; it brought back a quieter time in American history when there was dreaming, romance and guilt in the air with plenty of space and time to feel them in.
Unfortunately, Withers and Toomey's wife, played by Mary Astor, fall in love when Withers stays with the couple for a while.
The railroad setting, though, was something I have never seen dealt with in such a fashion (and makes me wish an "Atlas Shrugged" film could have been made when trains were still important).
Even more fun when you realize a good portion of the things they were saying wouldn't be allowed in movies again until the 1960's.
Impossible to explain fully tale (I'll have to listen to the commentary on the DVD at some point when my brain comes back to me) of a writer who gets put on the trail of a series of coincidences involving the battle between two angels to awaken their mother.
The story moves from one surreal incident to another, each connected but seldom shedding any light on its predecessor; even at the end, when it appears that our protagonists have triumphed, it's far from clear what exactly they've triumphed over, and most loose ends are left firmly untied.
I missed this when it was on originally (BBC1, 29th December 1981): the idea of it being on a prime-time channel in the Xmas period now seems lunatic, but in the 3 TV channel UK, such things did happen (now we have 1,000 channels showing reruns of "Diagnosis Murder" and reality shows Â how far we've come).
Moreover, it was originally meant to be a two-part drama, and there is such a shift after 90 minutes that this hamstrings it, when watched in one sitting.
I first saw this when I was 10 years old and it baffled me.
This movie is essentially the same as 100 girls (hence the name 100 women) but hey when you're on a winning formula stick with it.
That's what I had on my mind when I first slipped in the DVD of this movie.
If you have 10 times 52 minutes available for it, it is of course, easier than when you're supposed to deliver a 90 minutes movie picture.
Ik was skeptical too when I saw the DVD at Ð´Ð¾Ð¼ ÐºÐ½Ð¸Ð³Ð¸ (Dom Knigi or "House of Books") in Moscow.
Woland's meeting with Ivan and Berlioz, and the first confrontation of Pilate and Yeshua Ha-Notsri are not only beautifully portrayed and well performed, but in addition they matched remarkably well with the images that I had in mind when I first read the book.
I seem to be in the minority when I say that I preferred this version.
The computer effects are even present when they are absolutely not necessary and look terribly.
One must also mention the quality of Hamilton's performance in all of this; his character's womanising ways are typically exhibited, but his presence in this episode warrants respect, especially considering his unflappability and self-assuredness; traits which are powerfully upheld until the closing scenes, when he tries to undermine Columbo's perceptions of proof and the validity of an eye-witness (who comes forward rather conveniently late in proceedings) in front of his colleagues.
This looks like what they show on the video monitors when you are in line for Star Tours at Disneyland.
Btw, when Kot Begemot turned into the guy who plays Stira in ShtrafBat, my jaw dropped seeing as that was the person with the "cat eyes" who i pictured when i read Master and Bulgakov described him.
One of the joys of watching good performers is seeing them fall so deeply into their role that when their character is asked to change, the change is so uncomfortable it either creates drama or comedy.
It really is a great movie its to bad the Film Did not get a lot of publicity, I first viewed the movie on late night cable when I Could not sleep.
When Forrester leaves the navigator to march on by himself, he doesn't move him under shelter so that he'll have shade when the sun comes up.
THE PURPLE PLAIN is a British war film which means it`s rather understated when compared to its American counterparts .
No doubt when it was released in the mid 1950s audiences ( Especially those who crewed an aircraft or fought in the Far East ) could relate to it more but it seems slightly cliched now .
It's not much of a plot, true, but it's handled extremely well thanks to Robert Parrish's direction, which is surprisingly strong, direct and imaginative when called for, but still knows when to be unobtrusive as well.
Hard to do when you look like Gregory Peck.
I'm sure many teenage boys enjoyed it just for Jessica Alba (though I admit I had a crush on her myself when I was a teenager) but I still loved it.
Engaging from beginning to end, the story of Preston Tucker could only have taken place in America, where an idealistic man with a dream can come up a winner even when he loses.
I agree with other comments here that many dialogues are 'still born' because the text was transferred from the book too literally with no dramatic adaptation, particularly when Bulgakov's 'author's' commentaries were used in the dialogues.
This movie I kick myself for having missed when it came out 20 years ago, and it was only last week on HBO that I actually got the Tucker experience with both barrels.
This is true, more or less, depending on when looking at either man's life (right now, for example, Coppola is fine just making wine with the occasional 'student' film like Tetro).
This I mean as a compliment - Tucker as a film is entertaining because of how endearing Tucker is, how Jeff Bridges plays him in this context (a guy with a pioneer-spirit, with a smile even when things look bleakest), and how the villains, corporate board members, a Senator, the "Big Three" come off.
The other great one, not quite in tone like any other scene in the film is when Tucker meets Howard Hughes.
In the beginning he's maybe a little bit too unreal until you see how he reacts when he finds real trouble on his way.
But when it does, it is actually pretty brutal and gross, so it's all good.
when it first starts, i had to scoff at the acting in the first scene because it was SO terrible, but as the movie progressed, it got better.
The film starts with a very sarcastic and sometimes funny tone, but when the violence starts things get so dark that the movie almost becomes unwatchable.
If you want to be offended, you will be, but this film is a mess when it comes to tone.
A couple of years back when this movie was still fresh on the market, I had the interest of obtaining it and watching it.
So I held off, until recently, when I happened to see this movie on DVD on ebay.
The right answer is "YES", but you could have seen it a long time ago, when you were about 12.
But somehow, when we grow up, we loose that instant creativity, the kind of naive curiosity that drives children to filter Reality.
How many times do you get to see some old cartoons you adored when you were little, and somehow you get disappointed and tell yourself "It sucks!"
Some of his techniques are truly brilliant, yet when you look closely, every bright child could have come up with the same ideas.
Watching him you never know when the next head will fall, or if he's suddenly touched with sentiment and decides to spare some perceived slighter.
If you're still keen for a bit of Roman when you've completed the series, the movie Quo Vardis picks up where it left off, dealing with Emperor Nero's reign (Nero is well played by Christopher Biggins in I Claudius and Peter Ustinov in the movie).
This series remains vivid in my memory, no matter it was 1976 when it first was shown on PBS!
and being shushed quite vigorously when I walked into the place.
I first remembered seeing part of an episode of this TV mini series when I was very young.
I remember watching this series when PBS first aired it in the US in the late 1970s, and I remember being fascinated by the story and the characters.
I first read the novels "I, Claudius" and "Claudius the God" when I was a sophomore in college.
I watched the series when it first appeared on TV back in 1976.
For instance, when Joe Weber asks his son if he can drive a car, Jeremy answers "Yes, I often borrowed Allen's Mercedes".
"A Return to Salem's Lot" by Larry Cohen is not as bad as it's reputed to be.In fact I used to watch it pretty often when I was a kid.Of course it's not as scary or suspenseful as Tobe Hooper's "Salem's Lot",but it still manages to entertain if you are in the right mood.The acting is terrible as is the make-up of the vampires,but there is enough amusing moments to make the viewer smile.Samuel Fuller is quite memorable as a Vampire slayer.Overall,"A Return to Salem's Lot" is a quirky,occasionally uneven horror film that is worth a look for fans of Larry Cohen's unusual horror movies.7 out of 10 and that's being kind.
Michael Moriarity must have gotten laughed at when he played in this.
Those two just seem to click when they come together.
Slow to get going, but when it kicks in, everything picks up with a sudden burst.
Moriarity's versatility shows, and there's fun to be had when he's on screen.
Later, in the Woman's private cabin, when it is all over, the Woman's face goes blank as she utters the words, "You have to go."
She immediately rejects him, but decides he's not so bad when he redeems himself by beating up the men who are trying to kill her.
All throughout the movie, he has a seemingly endless stream of underlings to do his dirty work for him, but when they're reduced to rubble by The Muscles he should go completely nuts and wave a gun around.
Examples: 'Au Revior F***er' as he shoots dead an evil henchman, and "No, but I know what you are" when the Brit bad guy (See 5) asks "Do you know who I am?!"
Even cringed more when Jean-Claude made passes towards Rosanna Arquette.
I was shocked when it turned out to be truly well done, and not just for a Van Damme movie.
Plot Synopsis: Sam, a convicted bank robber, is freed when the prison bus he is on is hijacked.
The film, like many of Van Damme's work, does not rank too highly when it comes to things like acting, script or even direction.
He starts off as a bad boy, but of course his tough exterior melts away to reveal his inner sentimentality when he meets a widow and her two children, one of which is played by one of those hideous Culkins.
I have a few more odd movies in my collection), except when an actor that I like is in it.
As his dad is only truly happy when he gets to deliver tearful speeches at local funerals, Allan sees no other option than to make sure there are plenty of funerals for his father to attend...
Even when there is an explosion during Trinity, we see it indirectly, reflected in the eyes of one of the characters.
I had only seen this episode once when it first premiered, but it came on tonight and I saw it again.
Agent Reyes had been examining numerology when she hears of a recent murder, it allows her to connect this murder with previous ones.
The killer corners the agents and is about to shoot Reyes when Doggett, who had found the killer his own way, by recognizing a pattern in the locations of the victims, shoots him dead.
So, it ends up being a standard little slasher movie like the classics (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street), but it's surprising and incredibly smart when you think about how the movie got you to that point from the beginning.
Every scene when something even mildly violent happens, the camera is looking at the floor or the wall or someone's face.
And then, all of a sudden he goes to boobietrap a house where about 6 kids or so are gonna have a "party".. And then he just kills them all.. And they tape how he sets all of his "boobietraps".. so basically you know everything that he's gonna do when he's gonna kill them, as he first shows everything on tape.
BtM/TRoLV is low budget and for sure you can see it when watching it.
  I had no idea what to expect when I saw this film.
But when it transists to the over-fantastic directing of Scott Glosserman, made it to my 1# horror movie.
Scott is so ingeinus when it comes to his directing.
I did like the twist near the end when they discover who the real virgin survivor girl is all along.
But Leslie isn't what he seems to be, especially when his ex-psychiatrist Doc Holloran (Robert Englund) looks for him and Taylor tries to uncover Leslie's real hidden agenda.
The movie it is at best when they focus on Leslie's bizarre character and when it is shot as a documentary, the picture is really effective and sometimes very original.
But it's loses any real flair during the third act, when the documentary style is over and when it's becomes an slasher movie like any before is the real letdown in the film.
Goethals is also quite good but she shines, when she shares scenes with Baesel.
The documentary portion of the movie is acted and shot like Blair Witch, and had the feel and humor of Spinal Tap but when the movie transitions out of the documentary it leads into you typical horror film.
This kind of thing always bugs me when movie flaunt a B or A list actor, when they are only in there for 5 minutes.
It's so funny when he freaks out (in a good way) when he gets his own physcologist/doctor following him around in similar fashion to the Halloween movies and when he talks openly with his parents about his plans (his father is a retired "killer").
He goes into extensive detail ensuring that when he strikes, the killings go off as planned.
I was in the 4th grade when this series came out.
But even at that young age, I was only half way through that first episode when I realized that it was really, really bad.
He shows how all the "magic" that serial killers perceivably achieve, including walking when the victim is running("Cardio every day"), and the different terms ("Ahab" "Survivor Girl").
Angela Goethals is also very good as Taylor Gentry, the aspiring on-camera reporter who gets sucked into Leslie's disarming charm when he agrees to allow her and her film crew to document every aspect of his first major endeavor: the selection, preparation for and actual execution of a bunch of drunk, horny teens.
And I also want to mention the best part of the flick - when it makes its startling transition from "faux horror documentary" to out-and-out horror film.
Don't worry; you'll pretty much know when it happens.
The reaction of the film crew...at times they seem to be having fun with this whole, 'real life' slasher/movie guru, but there is a big shift at the end when the killing starts.
However, when making a parody of 80's slasher films, gore was everywhere.
I won't point anything out, because it spoil a few kills, but you'll see it when it happens.
I wasn't sure about this movie when I got it--went out on a limb after hearing some decent reviews.
He sometimes says creepy things, like when they begin to discuss his library of text books, mostly medical and anatomy.
The second half of the movie is when we get to see Leslie in action.
No one wants to laugh as scary things happen, but when things work out just as Leslie predicts they will, even the "documentary" crew gets very enthusiastic.
Superb dialog ("You have to do lots of cardio to make it look like you're merely walking when everybody else is running!")
He figures out who his "survivor girl" will be, and is delighted when he attracts an "Ahab" (genre icon Robert Englund, doing a funny riff on Donald Pleasence's signature role of Dr. Loomis).
Then we're in slightly more traditional slasher territory, but the movie continues to successfully subvert the genre's conventions, as Leslie is able to adjust admirably when his carefully constructed scenario seems to be going awry.
Still, in the brutal world of TV ratings, you have to be a hit straight away and this one just didn't cut it where and when it mattered.
Neither of those guys look like typical maniacs, so when Leslie does make his first appearance masked and all, it's rather amusing.
I really liked the Cupid who banged the prince on the head with a mallet when he first glimpsed Betty.
Betty as Cinderella was certainly fitting-after all, Cinderella did ultimately become a princess when she married the prince and Betty Boop is cartoon royalty.
They did try saving money on the color, as mentioned, but the whole production was obviously a very expensive endeavor, when all its components are considered in sum.
There's Albert and Armand's "maid" Agador Spartacus (Hank Azaria) who's almost as funny as Lane, and (while I don't want to give too much away) when you catch a glimpse of Hackman in drag near the end of the movie you'll be in stitches.
all of of the tortures in the world could not compare to sitting down and watching this filth.Surely even when this film was first released it would have been considered tacky back then.i'm ashamed to even live in the same country as this film was made in.what a waste of plastic and film.
Now, despite what everybody else says...this movie really isn't bad at all, its got great soundtrack, style and actors.The main actor Vince Colosimo is perfect as the good looking hero of the story and makes the character sympathetic as a tough guy who's just from the wrong side of the tracks and is really a nice guy!Watch out for the part were he hits one of his teachers in the face when she bullies him...cool scene!
*POSSIBLE SPOILERS* People often use the term "ripoff" quite liberally when describing a movie.
Often when a film tries to become a television series they do not bring along one of the key actors from that film but in this case they do.
Another tip is make sure the anti hero has family issues like a long lost brother who he hates so that when he dies the tough macho anti hero starts weeping like a big girl .
Imagine my horror when I learnt that it had been cancelled after only fourteen episodes!
Only when I saw the movies years later did I realise how inferior the series was by comparison.
But what happens when such a reasonable compromise is no longer possible?
I remember commenting back around that time that the Planet of the Apes TV series looked like Starsky and Hutch vs the apes and I still feel that way when I see clips of the old ape TV show.
Wonderfuly done, and at that point in time when animation was REALLY animation and not just the same art shown over and over or computerized "stuff".
Colvig had left Disney in 1937 and freelanced for Warner Brothers and worked for Fleischer as the voice of Bluto until 1941 when he returned to the Disney fold.
I saw it when I was a little girl.
So He sends His Prince to show His Glory and when His prince dies and everyone's heart is crushed and they realize the error of their ways, He lets His prince live again with Glory and romances the longing of our heart with LOVE.
But the film has real problems - these began virtually at the beginning of production, when the Fleisher's decided they would keep costs down, despite the ambitions of their project.
Gulliver reunites the prince and princess and is about to put a stop to the war when the spies pull his own pistol on him.
Oddly enough, he only says it at times where the plot is thickening, such as when the prince comes back for the princess.
Thus, when an "Oh my" is heard from Gulliver, the audience knows it should pay attention to this point in the plot, as it is important to the overall storyline.
Good examples of this include when Gulliver steps over the town and during the first shipwreck scene.
I used to watch this all the time when I was little, I absolutely loved it!
I used to love this animated film version of Gulliver's Travels when I was a child, and hadn't seen it for almost twenty years.
When it got to the scene near the end when they are bringing the child up the ladder, it sticks then cuts out to the menu.
Although it dates from the days when animated films were still finding their feet it lacks the honour of being a pioneer.
The film is at its best when it de-emphasizes plot for the visuals, as in the binding & transportation of the giant, or when the rotoscoped Gulliver tows the entire hostile fleet from Blefuscu up onto the beach by the ships' anchor chains.
It's impossible to not compare "Gulliver's Travels", and its songs, to today's animated product, and it's sad when I try.
What a relief to remember a time when that was mandatory in film music.
It is just as beautiful now as it was 60-plus years ago when it premiered, perhaps even moreso with the wonderful restoration we have now on DVD.
It stands on its own two feet as a captivating and charming classic story that children can enjoy over and over again, made when animation was really animation, and all the cells were handpainted by artists, instead of slopped together on boring, cookie-cutter computer models.
i expected to see a good horror movie, when i bought "the living dead girl" but i was disappointed.
There is conflict when she begins to fight her homicidal urges as her lifelong friend, Helene (Marina Pierro), wants her to return to normal no matter how many people would need to die.
Naturally, being a zombie she brutally murders everyone in the vicinity, but it gets really interesting when we find out that before death, she and a friend were very close, and now that the heiress is back from the dead; the old friendship can be rekindled.
The acting is surprisingly decent, which is good because one doesn't watch this sort of movie for great performances, so when there is one or two, it's a treat.
Life can be tough when you are a resurrected French vampire maiden.
Especially so when you crave a constant supply of ready fresh blood.
But when the story progresses, she develops a severe aversion towards her actions.
The most important story element, and what I feel is the most haunting aspect, is that as days go by Catherine is realizing the monster she becomes when the evil hunger returns.
Friendship and love seem to be very powerful emotional drives within this plot while Rollin often cuts into this with a furious rage when he shows Catherine's eating habits.
The episode is very mundane with a lot less to offer when compared to some of the previous Charlie Brown films.
But when Snoopy decides to invite himself over, he really brings down the house!
Little did she know that Snoopy was gathering all the eggs behind her; Easter morning, Sally is furious at Linus when the Easter Beagle does not show; Peppermint Patty was distraught over the wasted efforts with the eggs; Charlie Brown is distraught over the whole holiday.
He gives eggs to Linus, Sally, Lucy, Marcie, Patty, Woodstock, but ran out when he got to Charlie Brown.
I went to see this movie in '79 when I was a poor college student, and paid good money to get into the theater.
I can tolerate her when used in the right way as an actress.
Obviously I was wrong in what I remembered but the touching song was played in the end causing me to cry as it did when I was a child :-( I'm also curious why she didn't sing it as "her" song in the movie?
She plays Mary Rose Foster, a girl who grew up on the wrong side of the tracks in Florida, but by 1969 (when the movie is set) ended up as a mega-rock star known simply as "The Rose."
While the film is a very good one with Bette Midler giving a marvelous Oscar nominated performance, Ms. Midler is at worst when she belts out the songs.
I've especially developed a great appreciation for the supporting actors, which I didn't take much notice of back when I was a kid.
Anyone know when Season 3 and beyond is due out?
Having managed one very popular high-end Irish booze-hungry performer who showed up when he felt like it ("I know when the sound check should be") and also felt free to book conflicting dates on his own when he felt the money would be better -- AFTER a contract had been signed!
Yes he might have been a little too money hungry but by god he was right when he "fired" her... once the contract is signed it's too late to change your mind.
Its length is a problem: I have no objection to long movies which need their length to tell their story (SCHINDLER'S LIST comes to mind), but at LEAST a half an hour could have been chopped out of this picture and it would probably have made better viewing because there are moments when the whole proceeding grinds to a screeching halt.
A particularly eye-popping scene is when she struts through the men's room and the men get all freaked out and start jumping into the pool.
And when a movie is full of actions that require definite motivations, but don't have them, that movie ends up being tiring, pointless and unsatisfying -- which is what "The Rose" is.
Bette Midler at her best, when she collapses at the end you truly feel as if you have lost right along with her.
But when an artist gives so much of herself in every song she sings, it is no wonder that her life was slowly drained and eventually terminated by the fans who loved her.
Like 90% of the audience, when I saw myself I gasped.
Ms. Midler and I never stuck to the script, because it did not bring-out that her character had once been down-and-out when she lived above "The 777 Club", and I supplied her with drugs.
She plays a singer who seems larger than life when she's on stage, but once she steps off it, we see a troubled and lonely woman on the brink of a complete breakdown.
Celebrities however have a lot farther to fall than most people when things start coming apart.
You just watch Bette singing "Stay With Me, Baby" at the end of the film at the concert when she goes back to her hometown.
It seemed irrelevant when a former lesbian lover pops up out of nowhere and Rose and Huston have a big fight.
This is a movie from 1979, a time when rock and roll was still considered a lifestyle, and big rock bands were treated with absolute god-like adoration.
In this case, the music sounds as vibrant, exciting, and fresh today as when the movie debuted.
Although it never was explicitly stated in the film or play, when Tom talked about going to the movies, some took this to be his excuse to get out of the house (and away from mom) but I took it to be that he was possibly out cruising for men.
The range of (at the time) operating medical and CB radio procedures and terminology, the open identification with real-time Los Angeles and the range of rescue situations faced by Station 51 and their paramedics showed how thorough Jack Webb's research and commitment to authenticity was, pushing the benefits of the paramedic program in the face of a skeptical California state government; as a concerned West Coast citizen with an eye on the Big One he probably knew this was an important step forward in public health that would save many, many lives when that day inevitably arrived.
A motley crew of annoying people are washed ashore after a plane crash and terror ensues when some of them inexplicably turn into incredibly cheap looking monsters.
There is one extremely strange scene halfway through the film when one of the characters makes what appears to be a vital quote about "operation Naomi", it appears as if he has some inside knowledge about the hugely chilling goings on, but no, our hopes are dashed.
Just wonder when they found "Monster" in water in LOST then it would be too lame.
In to the latter part of the movie when they move in to the ''Habitat'', the group start to discover what truths there are behind the islands military past.
Who was watching them when they first made it to the beach?
It a fairly decent film,the script isn't that bad,and for being a TV film had some very atmospheric moments given the way it ends obviously they were aiming for a TV series but i really had to laugh when i read the trivia page "a pilot for a series never made" because whoever made this should be suing the makers of "Lost" big time..
It tells a simple story in a very simple manner: expressive of a time when gay men and women were watchful and fearful of exposure.
The surprising thing when viewed from an historical perspective, is that society's attitudes toward diversity have changed little and gay people are still struggling with the problems presented in this movie.
I really had no preconceived notions of the film when I got the DVD in the mail.
He allows himself to become a more marginal figure in some sequences Â for example when Spike Duggan is knocking out one challenger after another, Charlie isn't doing very much, and is off-screen half the time, but it's his reactions to the growing number of defeated men that is funny.
A lot of times when I watch these early comedies from Chaplin, I get the feeling that he is often trying to create at least a mildly engaging story throughout which he can throw in a lot of kicking and punching scenes, but in this movie it's the kicking and punching the drives the plot, giving the film an unusually honest feel.
Charlie walks with his bulldog and finds a "good luck" horseshoe when he passes a training camp that is looking for a boxing partner "who can take a beating".Charlie won't take a beating, that he has decided.After watching the others lose, he puts the horseshoe inside his glove and wins.Now the trainer prepares Charlie to fight the world champion.Can Charlie win this time.There's also a nasty gambler who wants him to throw the fight.And there's also some love in the air with the trainer's daughter.What a great silent short from Charles Chaplin.The Champion is from 1915 and it also stars Edna Purviance (Trainer's Daughter), Ernest Van Pelt (Spike Dugan), Lloyd Bacon (Second Sparring Partner etc.)
like when you have to defeat a weird clone you jut have to shoot him 2 times if you have a shotgun or "frinensi".
so i was stuck with it and so today when i bought it i played through the first mission and i was so excited because i thought that it would be like that for the entire first level but no it completely changed the level after.
However (and fortunately for me), my parents enforced a Three Bite Rule at dinner when I was growing up; I adapted this into the "Three Show Rule" and sat down to the next two episodes of "Flash" with a virtuous, if heavy heart.
We sit down to this show now with pleasure, and even choose it first over other shows like "Heroes" when we want something guaranteed to be light and fun.
Next is Dale Arden, when I watched it she struck me as very much a Lois Lane type which I thought was awesome, and having her be engaged to some one else is brilliant.
I will admit that I miss the intimidating version of Ming, especially when played by Max Von Sydow.
Another thing is that Carla the Jackal appears quite deadly however when you fight she fights worse than a............. well Carla the Jackal.
Just when I thought Sci-Fi couldn't get any worse.
I didn't expect much when I heard there wasn't going to a rocket ship.
Flash Gordon 90 minute Pilot: OK so the story so far is that when Flash is 10 years old, his father gets sucked into a vortex never to be seen or heard from again, the cover story is that Flash's father died in a fire but there was no body found.
1) why would Flash's father give Flash the Timex watch that contains all the secrets of the universe when he was 10?
6) Flash believes his father died in a fire, but he didn't, he was sucked through a portal to Mongo yet when we finally see a flashback of this "fire" it only occupies about 5% of their lab and is quickly extinguished with a fire extinguisher, its clearly not a big enough fire to cause major damage yet this is the cover story that Flash's father burned to a crisp and no body was ever found?
In fact I liked this this TV show the first time round when it was called sliders.
Our reporter turns out to be smart enough to use power cords to create a dandy electrocution kit without causing massive damage to the house electrical system but doesn't understand the simple premise of a tracking device that beeps when pointed the right direction.
I can understand the whole "Sliders Rift Thing" as a convention for the characters getting to Mongo - interstellar flight isn't possible for Earth when this series is set and most viewers realize this - but overall there isn't much innovation.
Ok, I was three when the first one came out, so I don't remember seeing it in 1986, but I do remember no.
But, when I saw this movie, I thought wrong.
The film doesn't really begin to move until close to the end when it winds up and down in about 20 minutes with a less than desirable conclusion.
I'll pay to bring my family to Crocodile Dundee 4 when it comes out.
(Like when Mel Brooks used jokes in his Robin Hood movie that he'd used years before in "Blazing Saddles."
The best part has got to be when they are trying to save the skunk on the express way!
Why critics feel the need to rip the character up for that just goes to show how jaded our society has become when people can't appreciate and embrace a quality like that in a film character.
Denzel Washington produces, at most times, passable, mockney accent although there are times when he lapses into American.
I have no words to describe what I felt when I watched this.
This is a perfect Sunday afternoon film, when you're stuffed with roast and vegging on the sofa.
I loved this show when I was in high school.
Hunter was a kick-ass, take-no-prisoners kind of cop, even in the first 3 seasons where only a few suspects were actually killed when confronted by Hunter & McCall.
Enjoyed the series when shown on TV first time around.I have purchased season one to three (as available) and I am wondering when further seasons will be released.I enjoyed Fred Dryer's laid back acting(I know he was replacing Clint Eastwwod persons on TV) but the cast was so right for the show,except maybe the "Captain', until the arrival of the actor who finally settled in the role.I seem to have forgotten the name of whoever played the captain.
The action starts when he decides to go on holiday with his new found girlfriend and when he trys to obtain a passport HE IS REFUSED!
This movie is so funny, like killing a wasp right in the face, or when your chickens have gone walkabout.
My favourite part was when they escape from the prison BECAUSE THEY ARE DRESSED AS CLOWNS!
But when Skip shows he has undiscovered talents as a rodeo champ the crooked Warden forces him to compete in the annual rodeo competition, giving Skip, Harry and some others a chance to escape.
I've never really seen in do a crazy, comedic performance, so for him to be so on-the-ball and humorous behind the camera is always a surprise when watching Stir Crazy.
That said however, it is definately worth seeing this film just for the classic scene when Wilder and Prior are convicted of Armed Robbery and sent to the county jail.
The dead pan, stiff style of Wilder is dramatically improved when placed alongside the kinetic energy of the street wise, Afrocentric humor of Pryor.
They get a job at the local bank as a pair of dancing and singing woodpeckers apparently as a promotional thing, but things get hairy when two bank robbers steal the costumes and rob the bank, and the police blame Wilder and Pryor for the crime and are sent to jail, they get a chance to take the case to court, but are found guilty and are sentenced to 125 years in prison(no joke.
Still, there are some hilarious scenes here, including one where Wilder and Pryor try to look "bad" when entering the prison.
the scene when grossberger meets pryor, and wilder alone is worth it!
and when they are playing cards!!!!!
I may have even thought it was funnier and more exciting this time around than when I first watched the film as a teen.
I didn't know that until seconds ago when I looked at this IMDb title page.
On the other hand, there are also episodes in which Taz is the prey, when Bull Gator and his idiot sidekick, Axel, try to capture him for the "zoo-going children" to see, or when Francis X. Bushlad tries capture him so he can earn his manhood in his tribe!
This early 90's cartoon series was a success during its run, and still seemed pretty popular in the mid-nineties when I watched reruns of it, but unfortunately, it doesn't exactly seem like it ever was successful now.
Curiously, an excerpt from this cartoon is used in "Cruise Cat", in a funny sequence when Tom and Jerry watch themselves at the cinema, in "Texas Tom" - which is and isn't an amusement for both of them.
For example, it's hilarious to see Tom pretending to sing "If you're ever down in Texas, look me up" and playing a guitar at the same time (while he hears the record), to seduce the cowgirl (the well known Toodles, Tom's passion), but Jerry makes the whole thing even funnier when he decides to give wings to his own sense of fun: he ruins Tom's plan by changing the speed on the record player, which causes Tom to sing very quickly and then extremely slowly (with a typical cowboy voice).
I also find very funny when Tom is disguised as a cowboy and walks like one, rolls up a cigarette by using Jerry, a gun to light the cigarette and then smokes it to puff out the word "Howdy".
Tom, now a cowboy (or cowcat) on a farm somewhere in Texas is involved in his usual pursuit of Jerry when a gorgeous girl cat arrives.
It's a pretty funny cartoon, especially when Jerry tampers with the speed of the record Tom is miming to, and there's quite a bit of inventive visual humor too.
Tom is lying around on the porch at the Dude Ranch when he uncovers Jerry under a flowerpot.
The result is a less than satisfying watch with a bad after taste, when combined with lots of inconsequential dialogue and, hence, subtitle reading will make for a less than desirable watch for most.
I really didn't know what to expect when some friends and I hired this DVD.
Many of Rueben's friends are still involved in 'less than legal' occupations, and the poverty and wretchedness of the estate seems even worse than when he lived there before.
The hilariously grumpy and irritable "haute bourgeoisie" relatives of Laurence and Alain who come into play when wedding bells are in the offing include the great Bulle Ogier as Laurence's mother.
The effects are horrible, there was blood when there shouldn't have been, and there was no acting--just a bunch of monkeys moving around to a narration that held no emotion.
Oedipus and Creon were the played by the same person, which was confusing at the end when Creon took his shirt off for no reason.
I love this show because it creates a lot of drama when people can get eliminated and because it's cool to see all these different places they get to go to.
One of the most moving moments of the show was when they had one of the contestants was a female dwarf but despite her physical limits, she managed to get far near the end of the race.
For example when one of those black sisters called Luke "bitch" in the last season.
But otherwise it's brilliant show and I think everybody find it exciting when one bothers to watch it.
There's a chance for a slice of life movie about a bookie who's as ethical as such a profession will allow him to be and what happens when the vultures want to muscle in--a particularly annoying plot point by the way, since Falk's character has said he's retiring in a year and we believe him.
It's when Vinnie finds out what a mess Frankie made of not only himself but his family he tries to get Tony to smooth things over by having Marybeth pay off Frankie's debt by giving Tony, as well as himself, $200.00 a week that only include the vig or interest.
This has, in knowing a good thing when he sees one, Tony demands for Marybeth to put out, or prostitute herself, for him to make up the $50.00 that she came up short with!
***SPOILERS*** It was when Vinnie caught Tony forcing himself on a disgusted and repulsed Marybeth, in his office no less, that he just lost control of himself.
How can you watch a mystery when there's no mystery?
The similar styled shows on television, as well as many of the other shows, particularly the so-called "comedy" shows are almost always misrepresented as "wholesome family entertainment" when in fact they are thinly guised (or not so thinly guised) sadism, racism, and/or pandering to any number of the lowest human traits.
Get back to me when you become funny again.
Peter De Rome's 'Adam and Yves' was exciting when it arrived in 1974, although De Rome can be a bit corny.
I paid little attention to him during his heyday, when his face, in particular, looked like that of an inflatable girl dildo.
The problem of this kind of neurosis, even when successful, is that there is a peculiar lack of interest in much of anything else.
This kind of 'dream person', though, tells about early childhood, and there is no follow-up about any further relationships with his family, leading one to assume he left them for good, and remains intoxicated with the days when he can still walk the streets and be told he's 'cute.'
He is definitely 'cute' now, and could afford to wear a lot of dressy things and be a great stylish older beauty by now, and the looser clothing he is seen in when interviewed in the film shows that his taste is still sharp.
Who wants to hear the Hollow's Henrietta discuss what a complex person she is when action and interaction speak louder than words?
Containing hundreds of Berlin's pictures of himself (every inch of himself), his vain, self absorbed persona drew me in much as it apparently drew in thousands when he was a 30 year old exhibitionist hunk cruising the streets of San Francisco in his white, skin tight, pants (with a bushel sized basket) and blonde page-boy haircut in the 70's.
My favorite scene is when both families are sitting together eating dinner.
In Joshua the music fit the film perfectly, especially the low growl when the camera turned to the black rider.
Though I prefer an unpredictable story line, this film can be good when one prefers sometime something simple.
This movie has the cheesiest special effects i've ever seen in my life, as can be expected from a movie from 1972. for example, when an alligator is following this dude, you can see that they had to speed up the film.
The canoe overturns when it gets caught in the wake of a speedboat that passes too close.
Keep your doors and ground-floor windows closed, they'll go away when they need to spawn.
Milland, as Mr.Grumpy, plays a ridiculous character who, even when faced with a catastrophe, finds the time to grumble about trivialities, and everyone around him has to take note of him because of the testament money.
At the end of the movie Elliot says that "it's a long story"; very long, indeed, particularly when one considers that there isn't enough actual plot to even fill a 25-minute TV episode of any "Tales of the Something or Other" type of show.
And my favorite was when the guy wrestled with a gator--and if you looked closely, you could see that the animal's jaws were taped shut!
The most inane death scene was when Lynn Borden gets killed by a turtle and a school of crabs.
However, she is supposedly stuck in the mud, when she spots the enormous turtle, you can clearly see Lynn LIFT HER LEFT LEG out of her supposed implanted doom.
I saw this movie at the cinema when I was 12 and thought it was creepy.
A high point is when pink and frilly Aunt Iris goes out butterfly hunting with net and gets pursued by hissing snakes.
And when what's-his-name gets strangled by killer moss while hairy spiders eat him alive...well, that's just pure class.
I loved this movie when I was 12 years old... and I still have to say that, next to modern movies of this type (Anaconda, Arachnophobia), Frogs is still the champ!
I remember seeing 'Frogs' on some horror channel when I was about seven but I switched over after about ten minutes because it was so boring.
I had seen "Frogs" years ago when I was a kid.
And, we get plenty of images of life surrounding the island such as snakes, lizards, and other reptiles always present as characters move about, startled by them when coming across these potential predators.
Like many other "when animals attack" genre movies, mankind seeks to harm them by poisonous means, met with retaliation when the creatures have had enough.
Also, the beginning credit sequence is one of my favorite of all time, especially when the title FROGS is shown.
OK when i was younger and seen frogs for the first time it was kind of scary,then as you get older you find all the mistakes and plot holes and such.this is no way as great as Alfred Hitchcock's the birds.this one deals with a bunch of rich people all celebrating the 4th of July.y birthdays on a Florida island.the patriarch(Ray Milland)who was a hunter before his crippling accident invites his family members all doltish and strange with the exception of his granddaughter(Joan Van Ark)and a model(Judy Pace)and a photographer(Sam Elliot)who is just passing through after his canoe is capsized by a drunken boater(Adam Roarke)the scenes with the animals attacking are really bad.and don't come off as realistic.a harmless rat snake,harmless geckos and anoles,even a snapping turtle,a slow moving one at that.there is a scene where some of the characters flag down a motorist.and the motorist stops for them one of them is carrying a rifle.OK if thats me i would'nt stop for anyone especially if they are carrying a rifle.
And it's not as much fun when you can't play along.
This movie is a funny movie for when you don't want to have to do too much thinking.
My favorite scene is when Gunther looks for a bottle of Coke and is overwhelmed by "Coke with sugar, Coke without sugar, Coke with caffeine, Coke without caffeine, Coke with caffeine without sugar ...
A seemingly heartless, stingy bookie accepts a little girl as a marker for a bet, but when the girl's father is killed by notorious gangsters, the bookie, Sorrowful Jones, is stuck with her.
Sorrowful Jones, the cheap bookie, is played to a tee by Bob Hope, who suddenly has a little girl to look after when her father leaves her in his care as a bet marker, and doesn't come back.
(Make sure you're not eating when you watch this, because they shoot them out so suddenly that you're likely to end up wearing your lunch.)
(***)  (Read also pajak3's excellent IMDb comment on this movie - the sentence "there is no such thing as a lighter side of crime" is particularly spot-on, especially when we're talking about murder)
I took the film out on DVD and consequently had the facility to go back over the film when I felt that I "didn't get it".
The disaster, however, manifests itself in a direction not anticipated when the lead actress, Sylvia Martin, whose place Sarah wanted to supplant, suffers fatal injuries.
A girl who hovers around the aging Zao and relies on him to feed her birds, and who should be the very embodiment of innocence, is riddled with jealousy (for the 'artiste'), malevolence (her interception of Sarah's parting letter is truly spiteful), and greed - which nearly results in her death when she hungrily snatches up the poisoned cake.
But he prepares a lethal cake with Sarah's sleeping pills which he had formerly substituted with rice grains, when she tried to commit suicide, after she rejected him.
In that everyone in the building in which he lives respects him, and when a young and beautiful new tenant played wonderfully by Leelee Sobieski comes into the picture.
An Australian director working in France for the first time (in French language) with two American lead actors (one of whom apparently didn't speak any French when cast) and a script worked on by veteran scriptwriter Gerard Brach (Jean De Florette, The Name Of The Rose) could have been a mess but instead Samantha Lang has crafted a beautifully moving and delicate drama.
This isolation has kept the accent there mostly unaltered since the 17th century days when it was inhabited by British seamen.
I first saw this show when I was very young (when it first came out).
And when he announces, "I'm just going to cut up a fish," he sounds as if he knows a lot more about cutting up fish than about science.
Until the monster really begins to strike the film is a very British affair, stiff upper lips and tightly controlled and when the monster does strike the reactions to it are British indeed, making for some chuckle worthy lines of dialogue.
The monster is a tad patchy in its appearance, at first looking pretty shabby, when it properly emerges it is an effectively fearsome force, and the final effects work of the great Willis O'Brien (King Kong).
I loved the beginning when the old man got fried.
I dream of the day when someone with a brain remakes this with modern techniques without ruining the movie as they did with Godzilla.
I saw this film when I was in like 8th grade on AMC I loved it.
Well at the time in 8th grade when I saw this film on AMC I thought it was good but didn't think much of it.
And also has 1958 for the release year when it actually was released until 1959.
I first saw this late-night camp classic when it was released in the late Fifties and clearly recall leaving the cinema with a fetid taste in my mouth.
This disaster actually got a considerable round of applause when the credits came up!!!
Of all the "lizard" movies this was the only one that scared the cheese out of me, having first viewed it when I was eight years old in 1963!
I first saw this movie when I was 9 years old and it was the scariest movie I'd ever seen.
By treating the film as a detective thriller, Lourie managed to keep it moving, involving the cast in various bits of business that hold the audience even when the animal does not appear.
I am not a professional musician, but always remember these words when playing an instrument.
Usually when very strong reactions are evoked of such diametric opposition, it can only mean one thing: Great Art.
A rare, perfect, and hilarious movie that uses every comic device; two of the funniest moments are when a young Broderick Crawford and later Edward G. get hit by a car.
It's a pretty funny film, best scene is when Crawford strikes a pipeline in the basement and for a minute they think they've struck oil in New York City.
This movie was made when entertainment WAS entertainment.
Around the 6th minute after the movie starts, when Robinson's telling Crawford that the warden's neck tie was the hardest to get from him , is hysterical , not to mention when their playing baseball in the prison's yard, or when they're digging a hole in the basement of the luggage store.
Three crooks (including Edward G. Robinson, with mind-racing gusto) give up plans to rob a bank when they realize the sweetest racket of all: capitalism.
Edward G. Robinson is "Pressure," an ex-con who at first tries to keep customers out of the store ("if a customer comes in, blow him off") - but when he tells the young woman like a daughter to him (Wyman) that he's sincere, she starts working with a luggage salesman (Carson) on big promotions.
However, when an ex con comes into the store to borrow money, he realizes the store is a front for a bank robbery and goes back and tells a scary prisoner, Leo (Quinn) who escapes and decides to do the job himself.
The funniest scene is the aggravated Robinson wrapping a suitcase when a customer asks for gift-wrapping.
(The thieves break open a water pipe while digging the tunnel; the original plan fizzles out when the phony business upstairs becomes an economic bonanza.)
To make sure that Russell doesn't double-cross him, Van Cleef implants a couple of mini bombs in his veins, just enough for him to bleed out when detonated in seconds.
One of John Carpenter's earliest films, Escape from New York was a daring undertaking when it was created and isn't often fully appreciated today.
His dark view of the future of humanity, and his humiliating criticism of the U.S. president and authority in general, were not readily accepted when this film was released.
Great plot with great character makes this one of John Carpenter's best films, it is a shame they had to cut out the start of the movie when it was put in theaters in 1981, where Snake Plissken and his partner do the robbery and later, Snake's partner gets killed, and Snake gets caught by the United States Police Force.
He doesn't say much -- he usually lets his guns or his fists speak for him -- but when he does speak, he doesn't mince words.
The time has run away from this movie indeed but forget that when you see this.
The jokes are funny as they were when Otto told them the first time and the little new stuff is pretty cool.
I took it seriously when I was in my early teen years and first saw it, and loved it.
This movie seemed so dark and gritty and hard-hitting when I was 14.
When I grew up and saw it again, I found that unlike 99% of the stuff I'd thought was good when I was 14 years old, I actually still liked this movie almost as much as I originally did, but for completely different reasons.
Kurt Russell is awesome as Snake Plisken(in one of his best roles), who is the prisoner who is chosen to rescue the President when Air Force crashes in New York City in exchange for a full parole.
But when a gang of freedom fighters hijack air force one and subsequently crash land there, it's an eerie precursor of events of 911, the president played convincingly by Donald Pleasance is taken hostage by some of the criminals who rule the roost.
Is 1997 and New York is now a prison, when the president's plane crashes into the island Bob Hauk (Lee Van Cleef) the police commissioner, must get the president out of the island in 24 hours so the president can be in an important meeting for the peace of the world.
Thus when movie-goers saw him in this film, many stood aghast at his mature tenor.
In this version the dwarfs are not really dwarfs in the true sense of the word, (well maybe some of them are), but rather a group of men who have been emotionally upset by a woman one time too many, so when a bout of misogyny sets in, one of them sets up a group of men (limit 7) who wish to live in a world without women, and will go to any means to achieve this.
Many of the jokes are amusing if not downright hilarious such as remodeling the house to accommodate for Snow white, when Bubi holds the saw, and 2 other dwarfs slide the wood back and forth, or when Speedy tastes what he believes is Cookie's latest dish, only to find out it's actually a can of pink paint; oh, and let's not forget the mushrooms ;).
The scene when the dwarfs first meet Snow white isn't entirely a bad thing, although it's probably not appropriate for a younger audience who the original story is directed at.
But as I already said before, even though I'm normally not a fan of this kind of movies or of the man's work, I must say that I'm glad to make an exception when it comes to this movie.
"Escape from New York" may well be seen as one of the better action movies of all times and even after 25 years it still gives me a good time when watching it.
Sadly for him he lands right in the middle of Manhattan Island, when an armed unit lands inside the walls they are told that the president has been taken hostage and they must get out of their prison ASAP.
This is a very dark film, and it holds up especially well today when shown against the countless fluff films that Hollywood seems to be churning out.
You'll get 95% of the jokes anyway, and who cares if you miss one or two, when you're already rolling on the floor with laughter?
It's fun to laugh when the brothers' pranks catch these folks off guard.
This is when you find your identification with the Boys, and the movie becomes yet even more wonderful.
My favorite part was the whole "Schach" bit, I still giggle when I think about it sometimes.
The whole point of revenge is to go one better than what was done to you, when someone blows up your entire family, albeit unintentionally then what better way to dish out the moment when said opponent in the battle of revenge meets his maker, than by carrying out your dead fathers wish.
It was hyped up during it's release, so when I saw it, I understood why!
It's been over two months since I've seen it, and I still laugh when I think of certain scenes.
The lady was once a 'Daily Mirror' columnist and when Robert Maxwell fell off the 'Lady Ghislaine' in 1991 she penned a grovelling eulogy that ended with; "He enriched many lives.
As you may have gathered from the above, I'm Welsh and proud of it and have a big chip on my shoulder when it comes to Anne!
The rules are when a question is asked if they answer correctly they rise a stage with money, if they answer incorrectly they start again.
When she appeared on Points of view she looked useless as a TV critic and now she looks even useless has a Game show presenter and was right, she's only good at putting people down when she feels threatened by them.
I laugh when people call her the ginger scoucer with a face to drop dead with - it seems she gets up-set by these comments made about her, eh?
My wife actually watches this show on a regular basis but she puts the TV to mute when Miss Robinson starts her nonsensical vocabulary.
I remember when television was wallpapered with such wonderful game shows such as 'Big Break', 'Bullseye', 'The Generation Game', 'Family Fortunes' and 'Supermarket Sweep'.
IMDb user 'AdamFontaine' says he has a big chip on his shoulder when it comes to Anne.
Well, let me tell you that when it comes to Anne, I have got a whole fish supper on my shoulder!
These are the moments when Anne's personality makes the show, however.
We have all seen an episode where Anne calls a contestant out on ganging up on one individual, when it is clear that one person is not being voted off for being the "weakest link," but for being the only woman left, etc.
The cut-throat nature of it all makes the jabs and the personal interaction among contestants that much more interesting, and keeps the suspense high when time is counting down.
I always consider it a treat when I happen across it flipping through channels.
And when Al's efficiency with a gun returns, a young hotshot named Pete Grant (Doug McClure) decides to challenge him.
Both Denton and and Grant (Doug McClure) waver when they realize that neither of them can win, OR lose.
Still, these are minor quibbles and the sort of thing that must be expected when you only have twenty minutes to tell your story.
The delivery and execution of classic lines are very good, and even though you know exactly what to expect, they still make you smile when they are delivered.
This is a film that can only be appreciated when you have developed a very fine sense of irony whilst retaining the ability to laugh at simple things and yourself.
It's a rare opportunity to see veteran character actor Dan Duryea play a nice guy, when most of his career was based on sleazy,cowardly, back stabbing villains.
Niller and his very edgy and controlling wife are in the process of adopting a little african girl, when Niller meets the kitchen craving Sus (played with a lot of spirit by actress Sidse Babette Knudsen), a woman who is very hard to forget just like that---even though she has this hip italian boy friend.
Maybe it is because I speak the language and can much easier detect when something sounds a little quirky - whereas I am not as good at English and therefore might have trouble detecting their flaws.
  I was somewhat reluctant when my girlfriend wanted me to see this film with her, because danish comedies has not been that funny in the last last pair of decades!
I have heard so much good about this movie, and when I finally saw it I knew that it was true.
The only problem I had with this film was that the Italian character, Sonny, was a complete caricature - big bushy eyebrows, lots of hand waving, and, when he broke into Italian, used the most obvious Italian phrases ("Ti amo!
Around the cinema people was laughing at all times, when they once in a while got hit by something they recognised.
She rocked just like she did at the Latin Grammy awards in 2000 when she performed her best showing of 'Ojos Asi' to date.
he may not hit every note, but its always pushing it to the edge and when he does hit it right it is legendary...and people will remember the 2002 vmas just for that reason.
And don't think to much about kind of Âmessages' in the jokes: after films, which should be funny because of racial stereotypes, excessive drinking, puking, crapping, re-animating dogs, eating dog-shit, drinking sperm in beer and f**king apple pies, I don't see a problem in the (absolutely funny)ÂHitting-Women'-Joke, when all the male characters are hitting themselves through the whole movie.
People at Price is Right were asking Barker to repeat his line at the tapings even when he was getting ready to retire.
He turns to one-handed former golf pro Chubbs Peterson played to comic perfection by Carl Weathers, to iron out his short game in order he does not lose his long driving advantage when he reaches the green.
Happy is kind at heart but has problems with anger when frustrated or unhappy.
Sandler's characters tend to only make headway when they are being good, which isn't a bad message for the kids in the audience.
Omg that part was just so funny and also when Shooter brags it's funny.
The anger he has is advantageous here, but a big problem when it comes to putting - and an even bigger problem when it comes to dealing with smug competitors like Shooter McGavin (superbly played by Christopher McDonald).
It borrows somewhat from Caddyshack in the goofy golf sense so it can't be considered truly original, but it IS original when it comes to Happy Madison productions.
The old Adam Sandler character would be a man who acts nice, but turns violent and angry when he doesn't get his way.
Another hilarious thing about this movie is how many of the characters in the movie manage to play their parts and keep a straight face, even when Happy is assaulting innocent people for the smallest reasons, and cussing out the golf ball when it won't go "home."
Happy is one of a group of quirky characters in the film, but much of the humor comes from the reactions of the serious characters, and/or the extras when Happy does something stupid.
One hilarious example of this is when Happy repeatedly screams out every word that can't be said on TV, well... on TV.
My wife and I saw this movie when HBO or Cinemax broadcast it sometime around 1982.
It"s always frustrating when people fail to appreciate the entertainment and inspirational value of someone else's creation.
I was 19 when it first came out on HBO.
This played for maybe a week on a showcase run in my area and I vaguely remember being the on only one in the theater when I saw it back in 1980...maybe 1979, I can't imagine it was 1980, like the IMDb says...
Ram Gopal Varma is probably Bollywood's Stephen King when it comes to these sort of things and I hope he takes it as a compliment.
As night falls, their truck hits a bump on the dark and deserted road they are on, leaving them with a conundrum when they realise that the truck doesn't have the proper tools that would enable them to change a flat tire.
"Darna Mana Hai" is about 7 friends on a road trip that get a flat tire at night and are stranded when they realize they have no jack.
Darna Mana Hai is not your usual commercial Hindi film.The first thing that you need to keep in mind when u watch D.M.H.is it is not a horror film.It is bizarre,it is different and yes it is wonderful.
D.M.H doesn't scare you though the film has its moments.The film tells the story of 6 college kids whose car breaks down in the middle of a lonely road at night.They finally find a place to stay,and instead of playing some stupid game,they decide to tell each other ghost stories.That is when D.M.H actually picks up I wont get into the details of the story.Every story is interesting.They are scary ,they r weird,there is dark humor.
From when it was just a pipe dream.
It's no wonder at all when people think Germans can't be funny.
Honestly, I didn't expect anything amazing when I went to see the film.
Of course, when good actors have a well developed script to work with, and an inspired director, it's practically axiomatic that the movie will be a true winner.
But what happens when the revenge gets down and dirty?
Yes, he's got the machismo, but that seems to come easy for some; just look tough and act like you know what you are doing when pointing a gun at someone.
The acting was so atrocious that when a friend came over, we had to show part of it to her just so we could showcase the idiocy of this film.
I only recently came across this phenomenon called the "Indigo child" when a former school principal, upon listening to some of the tales of my firstborn, suggested that she was most likely an "Indigo child."
All I can truly say from a purely intuitive viewpoint (and the nausea I felt when watching the movie) is that this is the most exploitive film I have ever seen produced, written and directed Â worse yet than Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the Will" (perhaps as insidious).
I seen this movie at the Library like 2 or 3 years ago and didn't really want to pick it up, then I picked it up this year because I read the entire description that meant like Indigo children have powers and I just thought that it will make it a wonderful and inspirational movie, but when I first turned it on, I felt like I fell asleep in a nightmare of demon spirits until when I got to the part where they were in the house and a little girl was in the car.
The idea that certain children have special abilities that nobody else has makes for great comic book and pulp SF reading, but when it's used to peddle a corny, new age ideology, it wears a bit thin.
People with ADD/ADHD apparently make good executives, because they're impatient when other people start discussing things, and they'd rather make their own decisions, which they have sufficient confidence to feel are correct.
I was torn between laughing and screaming at the screen, especially when the creators talked about how wonderful their film is, instead of letting it stand on its own merits, which are all but absent.
Indigo is a wonderful movie, that appeals to all ages as essentially it is a movie about "remembering" the wonderful love within each of us and the psychic abilities we all have, when we remember how to use our psychic muscle.
I love how INDIGO was distributed - with the exception of the 100 AMC theaters that showed the film on one day at one time, INDIGO was only shown when a community requested it and agreed to have at least 50 people come.
All interesting story lines came to a happy end when Ray (Neale Donald Walsch) prevented the indigo child Grace from being kidnapped by her father.
After the movie our 25 year old son, who has recently left the Army, gave me a giant hug for the first time in his adult life and said, 'Dad, I didn't know what all this stuff was about that you got into when you changed your life around until this movie and event has shown me and I am very proud of you'.
In the beginning of the film, we see Don Ru scold his son, Chava, for seeming "too gay" with his friend Abel because Chava is spending too much time with Abel when he was supposed to be working at his father's bar.
I feel that the scenes of the men playing Dominos at Don Ru's cantina are the most important scenes of the film because it tells the viewer that although the characters presented have complex lives, the actions they take to reach their individual happiness are mundane when you take a look at the bigger picture, especially when you realize the men playing dominoes are older and have gone through many life experiences, perhaps they are trying to tell us to relax and not take life so seriously.
saw this on super channel one night when I couldn't sleep..and it had to be the biggest piece of garbage that I have EVER seen in my life.
Take a sip anytime someone acts completely devoid of emotion when uttering their lines...sip sip..pass out.
The movie really pops when this actor comes on screen, and fizzles when hes not.
As an example, when the two boys run away to collaborate with the occupying British forces in the Egyptian film, they try to cross the border illegally to the US in the Mexican version.
Of course, he must face the consequences when his family finds out.
One of the first great scenes of the movie is when, after abusing his wife a few days earlier, he's crying on her lap and looking for comfort and she's reluctant to console him.
Thus when Jose Luis comes and offers her a world of mansions, money, and sex, she abandons her world and her wait for Abel; for she wants her immediate desires to be fulfilled.
The film shows that when Mexican filmmakers want to tell interesting human stories, such as the ones depicted in the film, they don't have a thing to envy to the best types of cinema of the world.
I get suspicious when movies push lessons about life, as if movie realities can substitute for, rather than amplify, actual experience.
There is a time when sex is just sex.
There is a time when sex is procreative and therefore construed to be for love.
Best of all, there is also a time when sex is communion with another.
You can't really expect anything certain with a title like that when you haven't heard about the film or its theme before.
The tagline proposes: "The life he wanted to end, was just about to begin", in reference to Wilbur (Jamie Sives), who, when we first meet him, has just tried to kill himself.
Wilbur meets her, then, as she saves his life when he was trying toÂSoon, Harbour and Alice fall in love, and she moves in with them, alongside her daughter.
For Harbour, it is happiness he never felt, and you can tell because of how he sounds when he says "I'm going home with my wife and daughter".
The film too neatly summarizes itself when one of the characters says, "It's good when people who have no one find someone."
Although the movie momentarily loses momentum here and there, particularly when the psychiatrist and Harbour on separate occasions take time out to discuss the grim pathology of their family histories, it breathes its last somewhere in the middle when the focus shifts from Wilbur to Harbour.
It was a well directed dogma movie with excellent acting, but when it comes down to it the story was very vague, and I for one did not find that movie very interesting at all.
(it clicked when I saw that nearly every name related to the production was Danish that it might have been laziness on the writer's part).
I am struck and saddened by how judgmental many of the other commenters are--I'm not saying that one should simply turn off one's moral radar when watching a film.
In any case, I would think that the scene where Alice reacts to the news of Harbour's cancer (when they get back into the bookshop) would have been more than the price of admission/rental--one of the most powerful scenes I've seen in a while.
And, when his brother becomes romantically involved with a woman, it seems Wilbur has inadvertently stumbled upon a reason to live.
How movies like this get made when brilliantly talented people can't sell their work is a mystery more confounding than any presented by Area 51 or the Bermuda Triangle.
It must be ages ago when I watched a movie that touched me so deeply like this one and I was surprised when I saw the low rating on IMDb.
"Wilbur wants to kill himself" is a (so)moving parable about how easy is to let yourself die when everything seems meaningless and how hard is to live when a disease is mining you.
Set in Scotland and telling the tale of a suicidal man whose life changes when he falls in love with single mother Shirley Henderson, it is both witty and sad in just the right measure.
I was six years old when it aired & my Dad would watch it with me on Sunday mornings.The show was a great way to learn to help others and to be a good friend and be their for each other no matter what got in the way.
The chemistry between Fallon and Richards is awesome, and when they weren't on the screen together I found myself waiting for my next fix of those two crazy guys in action.
So do yourself a favor and let Deaden take you back to a time when action flicks ruled!
However, when 'The Story of the Kelly Gang' was exhibited in its original form in Australia (and later in other countries), the projectionist had to maintain two sets of apparatus at the same go, so as to achieve a seamless transition between reels.
The most remarkable shot is probably when a priest, carrying a wounded man over his shoulder, walks toward and just past the camera, creating a strong sense of drama and movement.
Up until World War 1, when initially neutral America began to dominate the world of film distribution, Australia had one of the most thriving and innovative film industries in the world.
If this sounds silly in words, watch the short and try not to crack up when Larry and Shemp say it!
Come to think of it, where did all the plug and jack equipment come from, why was it there, it was clearly obsolete, even for 1998 when the film is said to have been made.
when will America grow up?
It showed what can happen to a family when an addiction occurs, whether it be alcohol drugs , or in this case sex.
OK so I think its good fun,  On the TECH level  I dug the look in some areas more then others such as some ext stuff looked Well videoish (Being that it was shot on video) while the some of the INT especially when Rane fights one of the main bad dudes (who was giving a blowie to other dude) hand to hand had a cool gritty look, Girlie Club also...I wish the latter look was kept throughout more, that's just my personal taste..There's a lot of gun action going on in this flick!
Jan McGill as Wood's wife meanwhile is just so outright bad that it's no wonder that Wood's character doesn't seem all that effected when she (thankfully) leaves him not long after the film begins (I'd be relieved too).
He has a heart of gold when he is with his little daughter.
James Woods must've been desperate to pay the bills when he accepted the lead role in this seriously flawed suspense/action flick.
But it's a little hard to care about the way the characters feel when you don't care for the characters themselves.
But when it comes to the review of this movie, it's all good news.
(End of spoilers)   The movie perfectly reflects the anger and the rage that invades you after you're assaulted or your girlfriend is raped or simply when you're humiliated by your boss or betrayed by someone you love.
And please remember what I told you before; don't have any prejudices when you're seeing that movie.
Similarly, James Woods fits the central role like a glove and is always believable in the role; even when the plot is getting out of hand.
The sudden, no BS ending is awesome--I love it when movies end with an abrupt blackout like that, and he gets a great ending line.
I also noticed the back of the envelope calculations Atwill makes when pitching his stock market club for beggars only involved impossible amounts: millions in months.
  I started watching the movie while flipping through the channels procastinating from doing something actually worth time when I found this interesting.
Dan Lalande didn't do it for me in the dramatic sense but I did like him when he wasn't supposed to have emotion.
The music in the background, such as "Sitting on the Dock of the Bay" seemed out of place considering it wasn't even played when showing the only American-influenced group of people.
"St. John's Wort" takes what it can from games like "Fatal Frame," "Silent Hill," and "Resident Evil," but unfortunately loses its way when forced to hold up the movie end of the bargain.
Luckily I didn't fork out good money for this drivel as it was on cable TV when i saw it.
Turns out she may have had a twin who died when she was a child.
My favorite bit of unreality involves the caretaker - when they arrive at the place, the caretaker gives Nami the keys, but the scene is played out as a video game sequence, with the caretaker icon's lines being printed on the screen, rather than spoken - thus making it impossible to determine anything, even gender, about this "person".
I had never heard of this movie until monday, when i found out it would be available for rent(dvd) the next day.
The criminals ofcourse find out he isn't dead and start looking for him, when claire sees the criminals kill an innocent man she decides to go on the run with the boy.
Later, Claire and the fugitive boy break into a house during the resident family's absence, and then attempt some sexual fumblings in the parents' bed ... only to be caught in the act when two people walk in.
The film takes place in the fifties and we focus on David Moran; a young boy who meets a young girl named Meg Loughlin when she moves in next door with her sister after the death of their parents.
One of the few films that doesn't shy away from showing what human cruelty is, and shows that it is nothing short of disturbing and tough to endure, I've watched the entire film and I'll say that I am a fan of the horror genre, but when it comes to films based on actual events and you find out that they are disturbing and tough to watch, then you tend to view them under a different light than your regular horror films.
The lack of credibility a child has before the police, when an adult woman contradicts the information given by a child, and the oppression that the same woman uses over the child are some examples of why the main character feels like he can't do anything.
When selecting this movie to air they should have picked a more appropriate time, say at night when all kids should be asleep.
I am sure there is some excuse for that woman like she was raped by her daddy or tortured or whatever, but when bad things happen to you doesn't that make you want to be better than that?
Wow, even some of the reviewers of this movie seem to be at a complete loss of words when they try to describe the picture.
And when they get to the bottom, sick individuals like Ruth might even get some revolting kind of kick out of the fact they can use and abuse the weak to their liking.
Charles M. Schulz's typically warm and witty script milks the nifty premise for several very strong and sidesplitting belly laughs: Among the hilarious comic highlights are Linus fainting when Snoopy cuts up his beloved blanket, Snoopy smearing mud on Charlie Brown, Snoopy putting a white sheet, a belt, and shoes on Charlie Brown which makes him look like a ghost, Charlie Brown finally getting to kick the football while invisible, and Snoopy levitating the ever-snarky Lucy and leaving her up in the air.
Another cool moment occurs when we get to see the inside of Snoopy's surprisingly spacious and swanky doghouse.
I was glued to this movie, as was everybody else watching it, and when it was over, it was like wow, that was one disturbing movie.
But when they go to live with their aunt, things turn nasty, really nasty.
And as soon as she takes a dislike to Meg thats when the torture and downright cruelty begins.
Still, in a period when horror movies have repeatedly pushed, and even mangled, the envelope, this one derives most of its emotional shock not from graphic content but from the realistic and courageous presentation of a long-standing cultural taboo: on-screen violence to children.
Unfortunately, it's all too easy for mainstream critics to shoot down this kind of movie by terming it "exploitative" when actually it's the opposite: a tragedy that immerses the audience in the misery of the real rather than promoting escapism with comfortable, and clichÃ©d, lessons about violence and evil.
Yeah, it's always interesting to see how ol' Chuck handles it when life throws him a curveball, but it's good to finally see things go his way for once.
Thats when it all went wrong.
I watched this movie when it first came out.
My favorite line of all, when Jean confronts Det.
Tiffani Amber Thiessen never fails to make an excellent TV movie and A Killer Amongst Friends is proof that the pretty blue eyed brunette can act superbly as Jenny Monroe,the attractive,and adored teenage girl who is envied by her friends,particularly Ellen Holloway played by Margaret Welsh who nailed the performance as a conniving and deceitful teenager whose jealousy leads her to brutally murder her best friend.Holloway only becomes more hated throughout the plot when she fools Jenny's heartbroken mother Jean (Patty Duke) into believing that someone else killed her daughter,leading her on a wild goose chase for a killer who doesn't exist.Patty Duke's performance was so captivating that you can feel her pain and her grief from the time she was told her daughter had been murdered,to when she discovers the horrible truth about the killer.
The film doesn't crusade for allowing bad language, but rather shows how silly it is to take language so seriously, particularly when Mothers Against Canada invokes a war with our neighbors to the north.
This will be the movie I'll show my children when they get old enough to ask, "What was your childhood like daddy?"
He apparently was buying popcorn when Kyle flat out stated the point of the movie: that parents need to quit blaming "bad influences" and start *being parents* by talking to their kids.
A magic show can only mean disaster for poor Charlie Brown and his friends, especially when Snoopy is the magician.
Snoopy puts on a magic show for the neighborhood kids, and when he makes Charlie Brown disappear (for real!)
This show gives us some surprising twists to the ordinary world of Peanuts, including a glimpse (for the first and only time, as far as I know) inside Snoopy's doghouse, Charlie Brown's victory at kicking the football (maybe), and a rare moment of Lucy getting (in my opinion) her well-deserved comeuppance when Snoopy performs a feat of levitation on her and leaves her in a very interesting situation.
I've been watching the show since it started back in '97, so of course i went and saw the movie when it opened.
I was a little concerned when hearing that it was done as a musical, as all the voices are pretty unique and wasn't sure how they would convert over to singing, but was pleasantly surprised.
The comedy of the TV show shines through, and you can easily see how "different" the authors are when they're not required to keep some things out for TV viewing.
So, this movie is about when two Canadians, Terrance and Phillip, make a movie.
They disobey, (as usual) and it leads to Kenny trying to attempt one of the stunts, (catching your "fart" on fire)leading to his death when a Doctor replaces his heart with a baked potato.
Eminem meeting Disney and a horror film (you'll know what I mean when you've seen the film), it really has not much of a plot, but it still is entertaining.
At 15 years of age, it was just a cool-looking 'horror' film--I couldn't latch on to Morgan Freeman's dialog, and found Brad Pitt's cocky go-getter to be more easily relatable; at 25 years, the deeply-entrenched realism of the script, mixed with Fincher's grimy, urban-life-as-Hell visuals and the jaw-dropping performances (not just from the principals--when was the last time you saw notorious scenery chewer R. Lee Ermey in a small yet serious role?).
We discover that when the blood of Terrance and Philip touches American soil, Satan and Saddam Hussein will ascend from Hell and rule the earth.
I think one of the things that gets most of us, (at least myself) is that when we were kids that age, we never would have gone around saying half of what those kids did.
In the future, when we're all sitting behind our desks (or whatever jobs we may have), we'll notice that we'll be humming certain catchy tunes and when we stop to wonder what it is, we'll remember the songs from South Park both with humor and with horror that we're actually humming them out in the "civilized" world.
In my opinion, all the jabs were meant to get people to see that there shouldn't be the divisions that there are and when people get separated, they leave themselves open to ridicule and criticism.
It's sad when a state's laws or a person's hysteria keeps people from their constitutional right of free speech and the like.
But perhaps sometimes when stigmas of that nature are forever embedded with your name and reputation, it actually gives them more leeway to make a statement that is political in nature.
The film also touches on racism in the armed forces and it shows how brain washed Americans get when there is a conflict with an opposing nation.
It may be weird to read a review of this film and have comments about politics in here, because it really is a funny movie and I was in a good mood when I left the theater, but there is more to this movie than just humour.
**** One last observation and that is, when I was in line for the film, a lady and her five year old daughter were in front of me.
Arthur Hill is the perfect chap for this rigorous acting workout: he's an Everyman, a survivor, and I sure wanted him to belt that broad when he had the chance.
I long for the days when ABC-TV produced classy, intriguing dramas for their prime-time spots.
You know that it is going to be an odd film right at the beginning, when the opening credits list the cast in order of their height.
I watched this movie and was disappointed in the end when Vic was seen as a bad cop and Colleen went off in the sunset with the guy who really is not a good person in all.
This was John Asher's debut as a director when his previous most memorable role was as Gary on the "Weird Science" TV series.
I'm always in the position of being a spoilsport as I usually just review films when people don't see what I see in them.
When it's a hit, it's wonderful and when it's a miss like here it's a lot less fun.
It is a parody on an unreality --alias, melodramas-- which hopelessly wishes to be taken as reality, when every "jabbernowl" knows it isn't.
The song about Chester is so funny, that there's almost no need to mention Fields' trembling voice when he's singing the song without any voice ("You know, we can't get any ipecac up in this part of the country.").
when he says the classic: "And it ain't a fit night out for man nor beast" and at the end of the movie don't throw any corn-flakes.
I first saw this send-up of "the prodigal son" when I was a high school freshman.
I grew up during the '60s, when Fields was in vogue as a rebel along the lines of Bogart or Brando.
Later, when the character made his debut on American television, the fictional robotic protagonist acquired the name of Astro Boy.
Astro Boy escapes, but is exiled when enough explosions knock him off the floating chunk of earth called Metro City to the ground below where rusting robots lay piled in heaps.
He can understand what robots are saying when they speak.
One of the funniest scenes occurs when Astro Boy is battling a "Transformers" style robot and learns that he is equipped with a pair of machine guns loaded into his buttocks!
Occasionally, Bowers' film takes on a grim feeling, particularly when Dr. Tenma turns against his son.
But when the action scenes are very well made, engaging and entertaining, that all is forgiven when you see Astro Boy in full flight and fight, with the finale battle something of an adrenaline rush.
What a sight that would be, just to watch Astro Boy in full 3D glory, but even when without that gimmick, this film turned out to beat my expectations, and this boy really soars.
Despite its shortcomings, "Astro Boy" still proves humorously compelling when its hero spreads kindness courtesy of his cant-do-bad heart.
It was winter of 1961, a time when the streets of America was covered in a blanket of snow.
I can see the robots here that portrays the feelings of the servants who are simply thrown out when they are no longer needed.
"This is what happens to us when they don't need us anymore," shares the robot, who looked like a mechanical zombie.
As bad as it may sound, President Stone had been on his own trip for power, bypassing moral judgments with his own ambition to power... and even when his ratings plunges all time low, insisted on maintaining his throne through extra-constitutional means.
The movie portrays what happens when a power monger goes on a power trip and those in position turns a blind eye.
He escapes, meets friends, learns what it's like to "fit in" and when the time comes he must make the "ultimate sacrifice" in order to save the people whom he loves.
I enjoy this film to my own surprise.While I'm not a child or a fan,I find the animation simple and easy on the eyes.You feel sorry for him when his own father can't look at him the same way now that he's a robot.After he leaves Metro City, he finds his human friends and through them,he gets to find and learn about love and companionship.Then he takes on the evil President Stone,who has become a huge monster himself,threatens to destroy Metro City and everyone else in it.My brother claps in delight as Astro Boy discovers his hands can turn into cannons and guns stick out of his butts.The touching scene where he sacrifices his life is enough to even brought a tear to my eyes.Luckily,he is saved and finally finds his destiny,and it's to help protects the world.It's a movie with a lot of heart and hope.Definitely a kid's film.For an adult,the cartoon characters may be a little childish.Overall it's a great animated film,good efforts on the voice overs and entertaining awesome sequences.
And when a movie teaches you something to make you evolve,and at the same time you enjoy and spend some quality time I think I can say that the goal of the movie was accomplished,they have set up the bar very high,but still,they managed to live up to the hype...which makes this movie a classic...1996...It seems like I saw it yesterday...
It's such a brilliant mix of everything, personally I don't think there's anything wrong with it, I know I'm probably too old to like that sort of stuff but I watch anything me if the trailer looks good, I'm more into CGI/animation movies, there's soo much more that they can do compared to live-action and if Astro Boy had been live-action then it wouldn't have been as good because they wouldn't have been able to accomplish half the stuff they did in the CGI version, hell I don't even know how they managed with the live-action series back then :S But seriously, if this is your kind of movie, don't listen to what the bad reviews are telling you, experience it for yourself and just watch it, because it is a really fun/thrilling movie that can really make you smile, just as it did with me :)  Another good thing is that they haven't changed anything too drastically, normally when a movie is adapted from TV or a book they tend to change it, sometimes too much but I feel that they have changed it only slightly so that it appeals greater to our modern ages, the great thing though is that Astro is the same.. you know, same name, look, even the undies... but at least he's wearing clothes.. well up until the end... ha ha :D Although I'm not really sure what to think about the new characters apart from the RRF who are just hilarious, but I guess some of the others resemble or remind me of the old ones but the one in particular is Cora, who is mean't to be seen as a potential love interest for Astro (I think...) is just not needed really, I mean she's probably there just to fill up the space, I don't think there's an actual reason, I mean I can't see them getting together and stuff... but maybe that's just me.
And to finish off, I have some idea my review is just pathetic and just goes on about how 'great' the movie is.. when it actually is, but I just don't want anyone to get the wrong idea, it has so much in common with the original series that you wouldn't believe, it's rare nowadays that new animation movies have any background history (meaning any cartoons made and shown on TV before the movie) or even anything in common with its previous shows, so it's pretty good to see something like this come out, makes me happy to be the age I am now because when I was young CGI animation just wasn't this good... and that says something cause I'm only 17 ^^ And even if you have never heard of or even watched the original series it doesn't matter because the movie practically starts from scratch anyway if you know what I mean ;) So yeah, enjoy the movie (:
In truth I figured it would head this way when I read the director had no clue about Astro before he started production.
I have no ideas why they would get some expensive actors and actresses to do the voice overs, when they could have gotten legit voice actors/actresses for less money and spend more on the animation of "Astro Boy".
The movie had it's moments but as a whole, it was not that satisfying when it was finished.
But when the military becomes interested in his circuitry, Toby must hideout in the old city, where robots participant in gladiatorial games.
Didn't get the point when President is still speaking of reelection after being absorbed by a giant robot destroying city.
Arguably, Astro Boy is the quintessential children's action hero because he is an ideal mix of pure innocence, a loving heart, and an explosive little dynamite when the going gets tough.
The action is moderately impressive, on the other hand, it has the best "I can fly" sequence (I'm talking about that sequence when the main character discovers he can fly or do superhuman things and goes out in a self-indulging fun trip) and is superior in comparison to those in movies like Spider-man, Superman and Iron Man.
It may be just animation but when Astro Boy is having fun in the sky, his joy radiates unto the audience.
Well that was probably the idea when Japan created the character back in the 50's.
But when he turns out to smart for his own, The scientists starts to feel guilty for trying to play god, and demands he be taking away.
But what happens when an evil pollition(voiced by Donald Sutherland) slowly closes in on him?
I never expected to see some high-art film when I saw the trailer for the movie.
So when I walked into the movie I was pleasantly surprised that there are more than fighting in the movie.
Yes, it was very directed at kids, you know, the far off humour and such, but when I saw Toby, the genius' "kid", I felt that the movie was after all NOT just a Pinocchio rip-off where an old man made a robot-boy because he was bored or lonely... the reasons behind the creation of Astroboy were tragic and even mature.
I barely watched a show now and then when I was a kid (I'm 36 years old... too young for Astroboy), so I wasn't really aware of the story.
Not just a kid's movie, but a movie that I will surely watch again when my kids "force" me to buy it and to watch it with them dozens of times.
It happens what has to happen: "A Square" concludes that when there is a dimension beyond his there must also be a dimension beyond the 3rd one.
At least during the first half when the audience needs to get a grasp on the basics of the two-dimensional universe.
The animation is crude, which becomes especially evident when the film switches into the 3rd dimension (Spaceland).
As a person that is interested in Math and when I heard about Flatland the Film I had to obtain a copy.
I shall definitely jump to buy the subtitled edition too when it comes out!
Back when I was in the 6th grade my Dad gave me a copy of the book.
A potentially too-heavy treatise is lightened by very humorous details, such as the warbled battle cries of female lines in Flatland, who need to both sway and make noise at all times in order to be seen when not approached from their sides, so as not to pierce unobservant polygons!
She has a black associate who will finally drop out when the other trespasses beyond the narrow line between exploitation and slavery on one side and cattle- or even garbage-processing on the other.
Throughout, we are rooting for her, even when she is obviously losing her way in a messed-up workaday world.
The issues crystallize when a friendly construction foreman is ripped off and Angie is unable to pay her workers, leading to a physical assaulted and a threat against Jamie by the angry workers.
However, she soon learns in this cut throat game the people at the top control everything and when she finds herself unable to pay her 'staff', things get nasty.
The whole film, however, is carried by Kierston Wareing, with no real development of other characters such as her business partner or even her dad, who both could have highlighted the different shades of the argument and perhaps externalised some of the conflicts that we all face when we encounter the by-products of such exploitation.
Perhaps not all of the immigrant workers are so docile and placid; perhaps not all immigrant workers are so subservient and accepting when the roles are reversed and the female becomes the sexual predator; perhaps not all immigrant workers insist on "passing on the favour instead of returning it".
Therefore when she died (and Brad Pitt went and killed the killer) the borderline already ended and there is no medial no more !
Russians could have, when the country and its cinematography was free for a fairly brief time, not these days of self-censorship, return of government control and new rules.
This Russian film, from director Igor Talankin, was an obscure, independent foreign film when it was in theaters in 1969 and played in art-houses in the 1970's.
For Von Meck, it appears to be a kind of mental love affair, and when she arranges for an actual meeting in a country estate, Tchaikovsky runs away, breaking her heart.
I relay liked it, even when I rewatched it.
It was sad when they canceled it after the second season, but it could have been worse.
It breaks my heart when I drop a Freakazoid reference and no one around me gets it.
The show is funnier for me today than when it first aired, mainly because I now understand that the main target were not children but people of more age, something that is relatively unknown.
My favourite moments were the celebrity intro of the first season when 2 women, who looked like Hilary Clinton and Princess Diana, had a punch up over Freakazoid.
Away from home, the husband sits in his office worrying about what his wife will be concocting in the kitchen for his consumption when he gets home.
The feeling that washes over you when the credits roll in Seven (which are damn good credits I might add, start and finish) is on a par with a great Shakespearean tragedy, and it is for this reason why I think that films such as Seven should be considered as more serious in a literary sense.
I'm just going to go out and say it: this film has everything that you could possibly be looking for when watching a movie.
The words 'never better' spring to mind when thinking about Paltrow's 'Tracey'.
To conclude, there are certain films that when the credits appear at the end, you think to yourself 'That has to be the best movie I've ever seen'.
But it does make it pretty difficult to relate to your main character when she's kinda crazy to begin with.
Hard to pull off, but when it's done right it's scary as hell.
Then again, I guess good characterization isn't really possible when the film is acted by people who would merely call that a "big word," and not attempt to understand its meaning.
Both films show the price that good men have to pay when they fight evil and the unsettling truth that the rule book goes straight out the window when you are dealing with something so diabolical that it has no boundaries or limits at all.
It is a fascinating twist that when the killers motives become clearer, Somerset with his greater understanding actually feels some degree of empathy with him.
I knew this movie was going to be crap when I saw that it had been filmed using the same handy-cam that I use for family events.
The only scene that I thought was remotely worth watching was when you briefly see the "Killer" in a flash of cheesy lightning.
How can she leave when she's more terrified of going out?
We watch a new horror movie every week so we have a VERY open mind when it comes to low-budget films.
I mean, I am a busy person... but this film was well worth my time... Perhaps the best Brad Pitt film that I have seen, this film involves two detectives (Pitt and Freeman) going after a delusional killer (Kevin Spacey) who murders his victims according to the seven deadly sins: gluttony, greed, lust, etc... Spacey takes pride in his killings and leaves clues for the police, similar to "Son of Sam" killer David Berkowitz when he murdered six women in New York City in the 1970's ("Summer of Sam"= another great film)...
Then, she is downright catty and confrontational when this person comes out to help.
Writer director David Cross who is a first timer when it comes to credentials, isn't necessarily to blame.
I also love the brother, sister relationship, and when she finally meets her love.
Likewise the broad slapstick that can work when it is motivated is just empty kicking and food-throwing here.
In 'The Hobo' we see one of these early on, when West alights from the train and runs afoul of a railway navvy.
Here, when West sells the railway tickets, he measures them out like yard goods: an echo of Chaplin's archetypal conversion sequence in 'The Pawnshop' in which he treated an alarm clock like nearly everything EXCEPT an alarm clock.
I thought this movie was decent and, but of course, I knew when I got it I wouldn't be saying after I had watched it, "Oh my god, this movie was perfect, it's the best movie ever!"
This movie is worth the watch and aside from minor problems, like the way they filmed it, it looked like you took your own camera and filmed it yourself, and when the old man dies, you can see him breathing, and he moves his thumb, lol, this really was a fine movie.
The two "bad guys" (Michael Nardelli and Colton James) really tear it up and should have been arrested following the race (lets add a little drama), but we don't even see Nardelli when he loses, so there isn't even a chance to rub it in a bit.
Naturally his parents disaprove of their friendship but this changes when Patrick takes an interest in riding and wants to compete in the big derby.
But let's not look for flaws when there really aren't any.
This is what I expected to do recently when I picked up a new horse movie called The Derby Stallion.
Even worse was when they switched to the legs of a dark bay horse jumping when the lead horse was a bright chestnut.
(For example, he did come to Willie's aid when he was thrown out of the party by the bigots, even though it meant giving up a chance with one of the few women in the movie who didn't flat out ignore his come-ons.)
While watching the movie itself, I thought it a bit anti-climatic, but when mulling it over later, the images echo very strongly in my mind.
Usually when I watch it, it's because I recommend it to somebody who has never even heard of it, so I feel the need to let them see my copy.
I will definitely get the DVD when it comes out.
The days when you needed to learn a dozen different operating systems are gone.
Andy Walker, having written a mind-blowing screenplay, must have been stunned when he saw the finished film.
I was taken to see this for the first time when I was too young to get most of the humor.
But when this satire rolls, it really rocks.
Nothing Sacred has some hilarious scenes and great lines, including the big fight scene in the hotel when Wally tries to make Hazel seem ill by forcing her to fight with him in order to sweat and raise her pulse rate.
after watching this movie,one thing really struck me:how talented Carole Lombard was as an actress.she has a real gift for comedy,of which there is a fair amount in this film.i found i very funny,but beyond that,i just thought it was well written,and even more relevant today than back then.it basically skewers every imaginable target,including the price of fame,and paints pretty much everybody as phonies,when you you get right down to it.even your average every day person is painted with that brush.but this is also a romance and drama,and it also works on those levels.Fredric March is the male lead,and he does pretty well in the role.the supporting players are also good,but,like i said,it is Carole Lombard who steals the show.i had a great time watching this film,and highly recommend it.my vote for Nothing Sacred:8.5/10
What is good, however, the fight between Carole Lombard and Frederic March and when March and Lombard are in the water.
The funniest scene, I gather, is when March knocks Lombard unconscious in the bedroom.
So how and when will the charade be brought to a finish?
And when the doomed person refuses to die -- maybe perks up and remits -- the ritual is aborted.
The same thing happens when one of the parties cancels a wedding at the last minute, after the invitations have been sent out and the presents have arrived.
Wally Cook (Fredric March) is an able newspaper reporter, who when plastered (which appears to be frequently) creates hoaxes at the expense of his newspaper and his boss Oliver Stone (yeah, really - only he's played by Walter Connolly here).
She is invited to all sorts of events (when she attends a wrestling match, the two wrestlers - supposedly killing each other - stop to greet her with smiles).
Certainly the jokes at the start concerning Ernest Jones are not so funny now - although Hecht did work in a scene where Ernest gets some back (having been called a fake by Oliver and others at the newspaper, Ernest stumbles into the truth about Hazel - and when he sees the others is swallowing it doesn't give a word of warning).
The laughs only really flow fast and freely when we arrive at Vermont and Lombard makes her entrance, 15 minutes into the film.
All of that and more occurred to me when I saw the 1937 version (the only one worth seeing) of "Nothing Sacred."
But when hotshot reporter Fredric March gets a hold of it, he convinces his editor Walter Connolly to build up the story by bringing Lombard to New York and ballyhooing her into celebrity status.
My favorite scene is when March is walking down the sidewalk and a small boy bolts through a gated fence to bite him on the back of the leg and scurry back to safety.
However, since the film is a brilliant satire on the phoniness of those who take themselves too seriously, it is natural that when these people see themselves in it, they will be offended.
A Southern hick, I love it when Vermonters are made fun of.
The film concentrates mainly on the cops search; when it comes to the mystery part in finding the killer, we discover the policemen's differences in methods, and how the most obvious one does not actually work.
In one scene near the end, he makes it so when a word is spoken we cut to a character as that gives us clues to their fate.
Too bad there's no way to actually know when this will be on again.
The film is as fresh today, and is as relevant to the culture, as it was when it was made.
But the best joke of the movie is intentional; when sex is the sickness, who doesn't want it?
The best part of this film is that even when the killer is caught the suspense isn't over.
Sure, we can read "Shivers" as being a warning about the excess of promiscuous sex and the lack of control human beings exhibit when it comes to sex, potentially leading to hedonism (if not a modern Sodom and Gomorrah) and, eventually, death.
Of the acting, Barbara Steele stands out the most, though her role isn't too big, she is as majestic a horror queen as she was when she began and the role makes best use of her.
Still, this slice of Cronenberg's diseased reverence for "the flesh" carries the same "I need a shower now" feeling when it ends, as it did when it first unspooled on movie screens back in the day.
Memorable set pieces include the appearance of the waiter at the elevator door, squeezing some kind of cherry crepes between his fingers before raping a mother and daughter...the daughter will have the dessert for her own when the door reopens.
The only way you can tell is when you're getting mobbed by these horny, over-sexed freaks.
Plus you just can't go wrong when a movie allows Scream Queen Legend Barbara Steele to strip down and get naked in a bathtub scene...which is only sexy for about a minute, and I won't say more than THAT.
There was a time when the drive-in was the place to be; it was at the drive-in that one could find gems like ISLAND OF THE DAMNED (an Italian fright film that began with a group of people coming ashore on an apparently deserted island, only to find that all of the adults on the island have been murdered by the children- a film that may very well have inspired the vastly inferior CHILDREN OF THE CORN).
Creepy in the extreme, THEY CAME FROM WITHIN is the type of grex that Cronenberg may have had in mind when he said this: "Art is the tree of Life, Science is the tree of Death."
what's he do when some hottie tries to get all up on him during the mayhem?
I saw it in 1979 when it played on a double-bill with 'Rabid'.
As more and more of the residents become infected, Roger attempts to at first destroy the creatures, then contain the situation, and eventually, when the block is finally completely over-run by sex-mad 'zombies', escape from the island.
Although Shivers might not 'wow' today's audiences with dazzling special effects and technical brilliance, there are still plenty of unsettling scenes that make this movie worth a look, especially if you're a fan of the director's later work: an early death scene sees a man strangling a young woman, before cutting her open and pouring acid into her body cavity; Betts (Barbara Steele) gets a bath-time shock as one naughty, phallic parasite pops out of the plughole and nips up her cooch; Nicholas Tudor (Allan Kolman) wishes he hadn't been getting some on the sly when his stomach begins undulating in a rather uneasy fashion; and a brilliant, downbeat ending sees the horny islanders getting into their cars for a trip to the mainland.
Especially when earl is bit by a zombie and decides to go out like a soldier.
When they chase the characters, it reminds me of the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror episode when they used giant donuts to lure Homer clones into the ravine.
The special effects range from cheesy to just sloppy, such as when the redhead was pistol whipping her zombie friends, but it just looks like she's brushing the gun against their face....all in all, don't waste your money or hardrive/IPod space on this....wait for it to come on SciFI and Laugh Your Ass Off
Members of a debate team, and their adult coach, are heading for a contest in Phoenix when they have this misfortune of happening across drug-pushing thug searching for the partner he believes took off with their money and cocaine.
Holding them at gun point, Earl(Gregory Bastien, portraying the stereotypical profane black criminal low-life who finds some sort of redemption towards the end when facing possible death)demands the group drive him to a desert location where his partner's vehicle is found abandoned.
These zombies, supposed to be ghosts of those cursed by Bill after he returned from the Civil War broken and defeated, finding that they had murdered his sister, only to be executed by the township, using the notorious killer's own sword, are yet another retread of the George Romero brand where they rip away flesh and drop when shot in the head.
I can only assume that the director was waisted when trying to edit this movie, because there are so many scnenes, that has plot holes and errors in them, that you just want to turn of the movie and lie down meditating over your whole existence, and why you ever wanted to waist 70 minutes of your time on this crap.
I just stopped watching it when I saw the "zombie" that was a fat dude with black lipstick on.
We cheered when they got it.
Maybe it's a personal thing, but it's a pet peeve for me when a director uses a specific tint for a purpose that is completely ancillary, where it's more about calling attention to itself than serving any meaningful stylistic choice (Spielberg may be the only one who can get away with it).
The highlight of the movie was when Earl runs into the room and sees N*GGER written on skulls and says in a high pitched voice "OOH Sh*t, that ain't right!"
)I just laughed when they had the music playing over the cop's radio talking.
When "Eric" set off the grenade, why did smoke come out of only the top floor window, when it was blown off ground level?
The end was a total ripoff of the Friday the 13th's, when someone pretended to be Mrs. Voorhees at the end to track the bad guy.
I really do, and I'm willing to forgive a lot when it comes to low budget zombie movies.
I wasn't too sure what to expect of this Showtime original when I tuned into it.
The "R" rating and the fact that this film has not migrated to DVD speaks volumes about our society's utter stupidity when it comes to treating Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual people fairly.
Rising actress Brittany Murphy (so good in very different roles in "Girl, Interrupted," TV's "David and Lisa," and "Clueless") is wonderful as the woman, displaying a touching range of emotions from wonder and excitement when she first visits a gay bar, to sadness and shame as the same townspeople who have known her all her life and at first welcome her return make it clear she is no longer welcome in their midst.
Fierstein even writes himself a role as a stereotypical, princing gay florist; personally, I find him to be much more appealing when he is playing against type, but that's only part of the problem: every time a valid point is made in the segment he shoots himself in the foot by following it with a Neil Simonesque gay joke that points out the fact that the entire episode is not grounded in reality but in a playwrite's fantasy.
The first on passes in 1954, when a navy officer (the great actress Brittany Murphy) returns to Homer after quitting Navy.
Narrated through all three vignettes by Eric Stoltz's character, the character is 6 or so in "1954" when a young woman (Brittany Murphy) returns from the Navy with a Section 8 discharge for "deviant sexual behavior".
In "1974", Stoltz is a fresh-from-Vietnam veteran tending grounds at the town war memorial at a time when the high school's star swimmer (Johnathan Taylor Thomas) wants to come out to his French teacher (Stephen Weber).
And when it was over, I was drained.
As Murakami, the rookie, Toshiro Mifune internalizes his usual intensity and lets his eyes and expressions convey his growing sense of shame and horror when his pistol is used first in a robbery and then again in an even worse crime.
Scenes and dialogue in this film just stick with you, like when a young pickpocket is sharing a popsicle in a police interrogation room with streetwise and experienced Inspector Sato (played by one of my favorite actors, Takhashi Shimura).
Kurosawa accurately captures the feel of postwar Japan, by actually filming in its locations (when Toshiro Mifune travels through the market - those are actual shots of the black markets in various cities).
After the rain comes a warm summer day where the murder is caught while birds are chripping, flowers are growing and things feel more lively then when the heat wave was in effect.
The moment when, visiting the home of his fellow detective (the excellent Takashi Shimura) Murakami smiles for the first time in the movie on meeting his colleague's children is particularly moving.
The use of sound is remarkable, especially in the last act, when what we hear through the other end of the telephone is deployed to powerful effect.
There was always a surprise around the corner, whether one of pace or image or sound or performance or turn of the narrative - though in fact it's a very straightforward story, told in a linear fashion, but that description really doesn't do justice to a sequence such as when we go to the ballistics lab at the police station, Mifune learns about a bullet found at the scene of a crime, and then he dashes off without any warning - and we follow him - to a shooting range at which we'd seen him early on in the film, retrieving a spent bullet of his own, and then we dash back to the ballistic lab, and then go into a microscopic close-up POV ballistics man, comparing the two bullets.
Another telling reference to the impact of the war comes when Murakami is told to dress as a down-and-out, and subsequently puts on a shabby soldier's uniform.
Kurosawa's kinetic approach to shot composition is really starting to shine through here, with whirring desk fans, spinning arcade games and billowing net curtains keeping moving elements in the frame even when the actors are still.
The heat wave builds up until the final night of the investigation when it breaks into a storm.
Both individuals fell on hard times when their knapsacks were stolen: while the former took the crucial step towards law enforcement, the latter chose the opposite path, eventually becoming a thief and a wanted murderer.
Much inequity in this world that takes away any chance of survival for millions of worthy brethren, much selfishness that brings only misery and loneliness!, Appearance and how much desire to feel superior to others when it will show us we are all equal!
I remember Ali and his sister Zahra, in permanent anxiety about the tennis shoes worn they share.And behold, with its immense sensitivity to the common people and humanistic lyricism that flowed constantly, also the master Akira Kurosawa was busy making a film where, for a rookie detective, your weapon becomes endowment constant goal, when it was stolen on a bus.
Most of the film holds up well but there are times when it drags which is unfortunately common in Kurosawa films (except for Yojimbo which was perfect).
Then a woman who buys it becomes ill, and when the dress is hanging out to dry after washing (apparently she barfed on it) it blows away and ends up in the hands of a young woman who lives with an eccentric painter, who is then set upon by a deranged ticket taker from a train, a bus driver, and then gives up the dress to send to Africa, but it's of course snagged by someone else who cleans it up, trims it a bit, and it ends up on this young lady who also ends up on this train with the deranged ticket taker, who then stalks her to her remote home while her parents are away, etc.
A very silly housewife receives help with her dinner MENU - and a cure for her hubby's upset tummy - when a chef magically arrives in her kitchen.
This works to his advantage when using the motif of hot, heat, the wretched weight of a summer's day in the more crowded, poorer areas of Tokyo.
When the suspense comes forth, it's really a knockout, especially when it comes time for he final confrontation with the thief, where it becomes such a struggle that the two are like, well, dogs, very primal as it boils down to the law versus the criminal.
The best scene of the film is its climax when Murukami corners Yusa in the woods, the images are wonderful.
Mifune feels a deep sense of guilt that his pistol has been used in these crimes and almost breaks down completely when his boss, Shimura, is shot and wounded.
Mifune's ride on the trolley, when he loses his gun, for instance; or the scene where he has to explain the situation to his superiors (and the subsequent search through police files for a suspect); or the long undercover sequence.
The only thing to do when this happens is to come right out and say so.
It was made at the height of the anti-Red hysteria in Hollywood, a time when subliminal pro-communist messages were being read into cinematic trifles.
The cheers from the crowd when they kill the two men (which is not shown) are downright chilling.
My cousin rented this movie when he was staying over one night.
I really liked the part were the house Blow up when he picked up that grenade to throw it back out.
Also when the guy was shot between his legs while on the roof--Cool.
I could not help Mr. Zarindast finance his own movie when I was never paid one dime, so I declined to come.
Watch out for the brilliantly choreographed gunfight towards the end of the movie when our heroes attack the bad guys' "base" (a bunch of rundown shacks in the middle of some waste ground).
The rest of the story is enitrely fictional and concerns a photographer who captures the event and becomes wounded when he is discovered by the militia.
The photographer's character starts to develop when he says he would like to have time to play with his kids, which he doesn't have because the life of a war photographer is very demanding and he hasn't had the chance to start a family which he regrets.
So just to add some extra lines to this thing rent this movie,buy this movie or when you see Dustin shake his hand,and tell him good job.
Tears could not be held back when viewing this BMW film.
I am sure it is not news when I state that Clive Owen is an amazing actor.
This is true art... when your friends complain about Hollywood, tell them they are not looking hard enough.
But Prior could act as well (when given a chance - see him in Blue Collar) and was a wonderful visual comedian.
In France of 1944, a bunch of WW2 US-Army soldiers are about to be brought to a POW prison for different offenses, when the Military Police truck they are being transported in is suddenly attacked by Germans.
I don't usually like war films, but I've really got to hand it to Enzo G. Castellari for this one; what we have is a true balls to the wall, gritty and violent exploitation masterpiece from the time when a bastard was called a bastard (and not a 'basterd').
This week is the release of QT's Inglorious Bast(e)erds but i will not be able to see it as the film is an 18 and i am 15 but will see it when it comes out on DVD.
Six or so rebellious solders are off to a court Marshall to be sent away for life for their crimes but when their truck that is transporting them is bombed and attacked they escape and try to get to the neutral country of Switzerland.
When everything seems to be on schedule, the mission suffers a major set-back when a second train featuring a host of German soldiers arrives in the village where the first was supposed to stop, with many men dead after all is said and done.
Bo Svenson as Lt. Robert Yeager, who acquires the leadership role of the team when he leads them out of a major jam where German and American soldiers are engaged in combat.
Fred Canfield(The Hammer, Fred Williamson)is the muscle of the group, his being black making things a bit tough when they are trying to go through a variety of German checkpoints.
In this case, our heroes are about to get taken to prison at the beginning, when their captors get killed by Nazi gunfire.
And just when you think the movie you are watching have practically everything except gratuitous female nudity, the characters stumble upon an assemblage of skinny-dipping German chicks with machine guns!
It was an old English video-version from the early 80's (from that time when video-stores in my country imported video-movies direct from England without giving them subtitles)  The movie have some similarity's with "The Dirty Dozen" and it's obvious that the film-makers got much inspiration from this great hit from the 60's.
But when they accidentally shoot a group of American paratroopers disguised as German soldiers, the Bastards decide to stand in and complete their compatriots' mission.
There's barely a line wasted in this flick, barely a scene that doesn't actually try and provide its actors like Svenson and Williamson Â also other very good players like Peter Hooten and Jackie Basehart and Ian Bannen as the tricky Colonel Buckner Â some good meaty dialog to chew on when they're not blowing stuff up to bits (written, and I was even more surprised by this than you, by five writers).
The action is shot and edited with the great ferocity possible when a crew gets enough money and enough verve to push buttons.
It was very hard to stop playing this game when once started.
Sometimes this gave me and my friend Andrea a real scare (it 's VERY suspenseful), it's always pitch black outside and you never know when someone might pop out at you!
Hoffman brilliantly shows us a guy unafraid to bare his soul on stage night after night, and when the authorities took that away from him, there was basically nothing worthwhile left.
And where's that good bit of female nudity when you need some?
Well then, where's Natassja Kinski when you need her?
Although the Lunts, when asked to do later film work, replied "We can be bought but we can't be bored!"
The opening in the gym looked extremely promising and I was just getting ready to watch when only 5 minutes in they go to the abandoned house and it went downhill from there.
Especially when you consider the dialogue they had to work with.
Imagine my surprise when I pop in the DVD and find a straight to video horror film from the year 2000!
I remember laughing at it when I was younger but now that I think about it, it just seems depressing.
(Villains are always so much more menacing when they speak quietly, as he does.)
Where is Jane Darwell when you need her?
THE SOUTHERNER was widely praised when it came out in 1945 (and continues to earn admirers) because it was so different from Hollywood's traditional portrayal of "the South" and played on the liberal, proletarian sympathies of certain audiences and critics.
And when Sam does waver after the flood, it's Nona providing the strength to persevere.
And especially when the family and we gather around the little hearth fire to peer into the glow through eyes much more ancient than our own.
J. CARROLL NAISH and NORMAN LLOYD as hard-nosed neighbors make themselves utterly unlikeable (but believable) as Scott's uncooperative neighbors, unwilling to spare some milk for him when his son is ill. PERCY KILBRIDE comes to his rescue with a rented cow and later becomes his father-in-law, marrying BLANCHE YURKA.
Renoir was still a master and had definitely not lost his touch when he made this saga about a year in the life of a desperately poor farming family trying to make it.
The second part starts when 20 years later Dane Corvin comes back to the area to visit his dying uncle (Hal Holbrook) whose last wish is to bring Dane and Hannah together again.
She would smile when she looked into the dark mysterious eyes of this half-breed child.
The combination of 10% cinema and historical genocide makes for a tense and edgy ride, especially when the new 'couple' is welcomed home and a wedding is performed.
Perhaps my favorite moment is when Milan's father Ljubo states that they just should get rid of the Serbs.
The ruse works, but the lovers have to continue the masquerade when they get to Tarik's village.
Of course when someone does discover the ruse there are unforeseen consequences.
A timeless classic from a time when events moved slower.
griffin plays a former fireman who quit when his best friend died in a fire and is now a tugboat captain and is now raising the son of his friend.
and what about griffin "im a bad-ass" faces when he does a karate posses or is spotting the bad guys?...
The movie was great, way better than I had expected when I saw it on the shelf at Blockbuster.
But things take a turn for the worst when environmentalist protesters turn out to be terrorists intent to take the rig with force.
He is working on an oil rig at Christmas time when terrorists led by Michael Kittredge (Jones)hijack the crew.
Here is the first line: "Former Navy Seal Lamont Dixon (Eddie Griffin) thought he left his fighting days behind when he became a tugboat captain... "  Okay I really rented the movie based on my vision of the pitch someone had to give to get this movie made.
* Male chauvinism - Austria still is a very conservative society when it comes to roles of males and females and who "has the pants on".
This approach is nothing new, but in the bad of old of the 1980s, when they were first trying to do this, what they were essentially doing is producing soap opera.
In a day an age when the market place is swallowing movies with meaning and history this should be an instant success.
Why we, no matter when you were born, should never forget.
I was so excited when I saw it was coming to television (I was in my early 20's at the time) and I watched every minute of it and taped most of it.
I saw it when it first aired and I watched it again this month on DVD and it is amazing how well it holds up.
I actually saw this film not that long ago on History Channel, after seeing the entire Winds of War on network TV when I was down with a back injury years ago.
While this series (War & Remembrance) is 6 DVD's (30 hours), I was striving for more when it was all done.
I watched it when it was aired in 1988/1989, so it was not new for me from the DVD set.
I read the book over 10 years ago, so when I saw the miniseries at my local video library, I decided to have a look.
The whole thing failed to move me in any way - except when it came to ejecting the disc and taking it back to the shop.
I held out and when the story changed person it got a lot better.
Why make a film to comply with a set of rules when you should be making it to pleasure the viewer?
Just when it seems that cinema has descended yet again into the deep abyss of zero plot combined with tons of special effects performed by pretty boys and pop tarts with no acting abilities whatsoever to disguise the fact that it is trash, something new comes along to uplift the entire sorry state of modern film and restore the discerning audience's faith in the true art of the cinema.
One feels her frustration when her husband and teenage daughter use her in various ways and make fun of her attempts to find her inner creative self in sculpture classes.
He blames refugees for taking people's jobs (even though he doesn't think it below him to use them when he sees fit).
I do not think she's the beautiful, but when you watch this movie, how can you not fall in love with her character?
There are so many great scenes; Melvin and his interaction with the dog, and when he realizes he has stepped over the line by talking about carol's son.
When Simon finds out (played by Greg Kineear) he decides to take a stand but is so intimidated by Melvin's antics that even when he tries to confront him he just breaks down.
At the beginning the racist, sexist, and homophobic jokes made by Nicholson are played for laughs, which is fine for the movie's purposes, but then Brooks expects us to feel threatened by the exact same type of comments and then warmhearted when he tries to change his ways.
The editing of the scenes where what was happening in his life, was being laughed upon in a subsequent scene by audience when Lenny put them in his own comical fashion.
In the starting when he did that, I thought he was a shallow personality but on the other hand I think he was a strong personality who brought all those social issues to a bigger audience for people to learn from them.
Another trip to the altar for Bulldog Drummond is averted when at a pre-wedding gathering in Switzerland a Swiss detective is murdered and an artificial diamond, courtesy of its inventor Halliwell Hobbes to bride and groom John Howard and Louise Campbell.
If you're expecting something as good as when Ronald Colman was Bulldog Drummond, you won't find it here.
This is a movie that should be seen on a beautiful day, when you're in a good mood.
My problem with this character (and the "problem" only exists as I think about him afterward, not while I'm actually watching the movie) is in his conception: he seems to be whatever the writers want him to be at that moment, with no particular consistency from scene to scene so when he supposedly "changes" at the end, we're left to think, "Change?
He's one of those actors who can communicate even more emotion when he's not saying anything than when he is.
There's some priceless gags like when a Jewish couple is sitting at Jack's usual table.
The same when he attacks Greg Kinnear's gay character with constant homosexual slurs.
I loved this movie when I was a child.
Warlock's spirit, trapped within a scarecrow as his burnt bones lie in a tomb buried deep within the ground of his cornfield home, rises when the erected slab imprisoning his casket is disturbed as bolts of lightning emerge awakening his lifeforce..that's the best I can explain it, folks.
Chronologically, I'm definitely not a 'kid' any more, and wasn't when I first watched this excellent series either, but I still couldn't resist its charms, and thankfully, had the foresight to record most of the episodes.
I loved her response when asked by the faun about the human beings' hand-shaking ritual.
I've always had it in the back of my head that I would eventually get around to seeing this, and it was all because of an enduring three second image in my head that I remembered when they advertised this movie on TV.
I read the books several times when I was a kid, although I haven't read any of them for probably almost ten years.
The Christian undertones are slightly heavy-handed (note: when I say "slightly" I really mean "extremely"), although this is not exactly much of an aberration from the novel, which in many ways made real efforts to rival the Holy Bible in its direct, straight-forward Christian message.
There are times when the effects are unimpressive and even downright bad (some of the evil Witches evil henchmen are of the old, cartoon-like CGI variety) and it's interesting to consider that Tumnus's initial betrayal of Lucy is exactly the same betrayal committed by Hoggle against Sarah in Labyrinth, although I guess it's not exactly a rip-off.
Tilda Swinton steals that scene when she welcomes Edmund onto the sleigh and really makes him believe she will make him king.
Anthropomorphic animals, when taken out of narrative into actual visibility, always turn into buffoonery or nightmare.
Some of them I memorized cold, and found that when people mentioned his name at parties or family gatherings, and someone invariably asked who he was, rather than explain his life or what he died of, all I had to do was recite one of his bits.
I don't remember what film I was watching (it was 31 years ago) when I first saw a trailer for the film, but as soon as I saw a clip of Dustin Hoffman as Lenny I knew something was wrong.
I bought the VHS when it came out several years later and watched it faithfully, hoping that as an older and wiser person, maybe I would find things in Mr. Hoffman's performance that I missed in 1974.
After the massive success of LORD OF THE RINGS it would be only fitting to continue the exploration of other dimensions as created by equally talented authors, so when it was announced that C. S. Lewis' THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDBROBE would be given the film treatment I was more than anxious to see what would come of it.
Early screenings gave it great reviews, and when I viewed I wasn't disappointed despite the Christ references.
NARNIA is a visually stunning film even in its quiet moments when the children, one by one, are entering its world through the wardrobe.
The green-screen use is laughable: for example, when standing on a hilltop, next to an animal whose fur is blowing in the wind, we see a too-close shot of the children, whose improperly-lit hair is standing PERFECTLY still... on a hilltop.
Had the characters been rounded out (one can interpret a book when making it into a movie, but nobody told Disney this) - it might have been better.
Another element was the suffering that takes place on the walk to the Stone Table when Aslan is to be killed.
Even when the children get to Narnia you feel the same way.
Even when at the greatest peril it was Lewis's kind words and silly aside comments that lightened the situation.
If you don't gasp as Aslan climbs those stairs and the beasts and the White Witch part the way for him, if you don't feel the pain and anguish of Aslan's torment, and if your tear ducts don't well up when the scene is over, I would doubt your humanity ( just a little.)
Or did he die because he overdosed on heroin when he should have known better?
My personal opinion is that Bruce is just as funny today as he was when he was alive: a dangerous kind of funny, a ha-ha funny in which you're not sure if you should be laughing but you do it anyway, a funny unafraid of anything, any boundary and any social more.
Lewis' classic is reborn in 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe', when four children from war-torn England find themselves transported to a land of myth and fantasy.
The four children seem normal enough with their constant teasing and fighting among themselves, but when events truly matter, they come together and exemplify the highest standards of sacrifice, courage, fidelity and heroism.
Probably the best part was when he commented on the two gay teachers who'd gotten fired ("There was no situation where a kid came home saying 'We had five minutes of geography and ten minutes of c---sucking'.")
This is a movie that should be watched only with your brain turned off, much like the writers had their brains turned off when they scripted this disaster.
She dominates this lame movie even when she's not on screen.
How can you curb obscenity when obscenity is the truth?...How does an overzealous, intellectual, New York Jewish comic ignore his upbringing?
Suffice it to say, "Lenny" is one of my favorite movies.. Often times, it seemed like even when Lenny Bruce lost, he won!!
I'll admit that when I first saw this movie when I was about nine years old, I loved it.
However, when I recently saw this movie, I was laughing for another reason.
This is a movie that when nothing is on you will gladly waste 1-2 hours watching.
This movie came out back when R rated films made money.
Furthermore the cast and the special effects contribute to these points and it is imperative that when one views this motion picture these underlying themes and points are taken on board to ensure a true appreciation of possibly the greatest film ever produced.
It really brings me back to when I was growing up.
I saw this movie when it first came out, and just recently purchased it.
It is just a fun romp into a fantasy that we all probably had when we were in high school, to have some sort of "special power" that made us different from everyone else.
Having never heard of her before, I laughed when I saw her name in the credits.
I liked the writing and thought when Rossiter appeared and his eventual demise was an idea that worked well and one I had never seen before, even in higher budget horror films.
Only when Rossiter gets revived in the last third and begins brutally torturing the ladies does this flick finally start cooking, but by then it's too little too late to alleviate the general tedium.
Nothing much happens until the end, when an ugly ghost possesses the photographer and hero-boy saves the day for the girls.
Veteran actor Albert Finney was also nominated that year but Carney won on sentiment and Hoffman lost out when he and fellow nominees Jack Nicholson for Chinatown and Al Pacino for Godfather II split the vote which led to Carney's win.
Lenny Bruce had only been dead for eight years when Hoffman portrayed him on the big screen so much of the audience knew Bruce fairly fresh in their memories so to portray a contemporary figure of Bruce's genius and legend was not an easy role for Hoffman to step into but his portrayal of the doomed and controversial comic is compelling.
I liked the car chase scene it's something new, fresh, comic and a very sensual idea(you'll understand when you see it).
Let me just say that I was very happy when I first heard that in Jopog manura 3,Shu Qi was going to replace Shin Eun Kyung as the lead role.
I was very disappointed when I saw Jopog manura and Jopog manura 2.
However there's a third party interested in keeping hostilities going; Jack Barton (Bob Duncan) and his backer Doc Peters (Ian Keith) plan to move in when the families wipe each other out.
Watch for a scene in the second half when Fuzzy shoots one of Barton's bad guys, he repositions himself ever so slightly so he can continue to fall down a stairway - no time for do-overs.
The first thing that struck me was the bad effect's in the opening scenes but then I saw that it was computer generated graphics and not CGI in a time when Windows 95 was the hottest OS.
The only funny thing in the movie was when Rutger Hauer towards the end jumped to his death through a hole in the floor: He actually looked relieved finally to be able to leave the movie.
Can anybody tell me why asteroids have an atmosphere and why you would use a pick-ax when you go there by spaceship?
Just when I was losing interest, I began to realize that I was watching a loose remake of "Treasure of the Sierra Madre", the great Humphrey Bogart-Walter Huston movie from 1948, one of my favorites.
The first part focuses primarily on the Mutual period when Chaplin made twelve films in sixteen months.
He never gained respect when he was alive, and so he died a frustrated, misunderstood soul who was simply far too ahead of his time.
A more heartfelt biography of the performer perhaps would have restricted Fosse and screenwriter Julian Barry from divulging into Lenny's more seedy character traits Â such as when he coerces his unwilling wife into a threesome with another woman, later ridiculing her for doing so; or when he goes on stage completely drugged out of his mind and makes a fool of himself.
Despite imperfections, "Lenny" is one of the better motion pictures of the 1970s Â and perhaps one of the movies that best capture the essence of cinema from a time when the mainstream and art-house were coexistent.
I was a teenager when this came out and that's not really the way we were either.
But when Shirley goes to his apartment because Grant fed her a line about modeling for him and Myrna catches them there however innocent, it's big troubles ahead.
The scene at the picnic, when he tries his hands (and legs) at several events is hilarious.
Her pseudosophisticated talk and haughtiness are amusing, but Temple is at her best when she's being what she is - a teenager.
Sometimes very subtle....as when Grant admires Loy's breasts at their meeting in an upscale restaurant.
Even your teenagers will like this(although they may roll their eyes in disbelief when they find out its in black and white!).
I felt the same way about her when I saw Fort Apache.
Margaret enlists his help when a casual put-off remark results in the daughter's showing up at Nugent's apartment to be painted.
She has guardianship of her younger sister Susan (Shirley Temple), a hormonal young girl who develops an instant crush on a roguish art lecturer Richard Nugent (Cary Grant) when he gives a lecture at her school.
knight in shining armour, through to her attempt to pass herself off as both Dick's mother and Margaret's sister when trying to help Dick escape from jail.
;) You just can't help laughing throughout the film--at Susan's misguided passion for Dick, Dick's helpless bewilderment when he gets landed in jail for nothing he can remember, the attempts at matchmaking Uncle Matt subtly tries to pull off etc.
I especially love it when Dick trades his car in and turns up his trouser cuffs to act 'young' around the Turners.
(Though who wouldn't be convincing when asked to fall in love with Cary Grant?)
Some of my favorite moments with Hoffman in Lenny was when he thinks about the nurse the first time, when Honey calls asking for money, and when he asks the Judge to sentence him now instead of going through the trial.
The latter wanted her to have an abortion when she told him of her pregnancy.
The man remembers Thomas who had inherited his mother's talent and used to study piano seriously until his mother died when he was 18 and he joined his father in the "real estate" and debt- collecting business.
We discover that Thomas' mother, a former concert pianist, is dead when Thomas encounters his old piano teacher who urges him to practice despite his ten year absence from playing and to audition for a new career.
And that is, I think, when his heart stopped beating.
My friend, who saw the film with me, said the title refers to his emotion when he sees his mother's former piano tutor.
While juggling between real work, and his potential aspiration, things go awry with his love and sex life, when he falls for one of his friend's wife, and when his dad gets mixed up with and swindled by Russian gangsters.
When he was younger, Thomas Seyr had a dream of becoming a concert pianist just like his mother but abandoned that goal when she passed away, taking the dream with her.
Starting as a thug for his father, Tom becomes torn when his love of the piano is reborn.
His love of his mother, which becomes tested when Robert decides to remarry, drives his passion to receive an audition.
his life is changed when he meets an old colleague of his mother who reminds him that his mom was a brilliant concert pianist.
when he goes back to his real estate job, the beat of his heart "stops" as he comes to see how spiteful a life he has had.
and oh, those tortured scenes when he's practicing that bach fugue over and over and over and just ... can't ... get it ... right ... i'm sorry.
This is a first for the French cinema, the remake of an American film, when just the opposite is what happens always.
the funniest bit was when they got rescued and they realized how close they were to the shore.
He's got a mean streak and when necessary, he takes care of some unresolved matters using whatever means he deems appropriate to take care of unwilling partners, squatters or whoever gets in the way of his (or his father's business interests), really putting the squeeze on people unwilling to cooperate.
He appears to be ungrateful when freed and lashes out at Hayward for bringing him into this situation.
It also has the film's only real weakness: it's glaringly obvious who's going to "get it," and the order of when they meet their ends.
The supporting case did its job well, and there were even moments when it was believable.
Especially when they get stranded on the rock near the end and their conversation runs from cannibalism to Moby Dick to metaphors about Mulder and a peg leg.
"Oh... No..." Another in-joke which references back to Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose is that Scully brings along the dog Queequeg who she adopted when the original owner dies in that episode.
The "Fox Western Classics" DVD version of Garden of Evil reminded me in terms of picture quality of the first time I saw Garden of Evil, on a theater screen when it was originally released in 1954.
The complications of the Hayward - Marlowe marriage are given to us in one scene in their cabin when the others are out, and we really needed something to fill in the background.
He is the jealous boyfriend of Moreno, and when he tosses a rival out of his cantina he comes over to the three gringos and explains to them why (he noticed their interest in Rita too).
The one image which remains strongest in the mind about this movie is how, when, and where the Indians, single out which members of the rescue party are to be killed (one by one).
Emotions become tense when Leah discovers Vicente marking trails and, later, finds herself fighting off the crude advances of one of the three soldiers of fortune...
The group's troubles grow when they discover they are in danger, practically harassed by savage Indians...   "Garden of Evil" was Cooper first motion picture in CinemaScope...
What makes this episode so good is that when the agents get stranded out on a rock in the middle of the lake, they have a real in depth discussion about Mulder's reasons and motives for chasing monsters all over.
Henry Hathaway made so many and such a variety of films, that when he did something outstanding like this western, people were kind of anesthetized and did not give it the value it deserved.
One of the best lines is when Cooper says to Hayward referring to her husband, that what counts is what one does and not what he speaks.
Who can forget Grant and Dunne's desperate search for a child, and their nervousness when they do find a little girl?
But with elements of drama combined, I was confused when the movie continually lapsed into comedy, then back to tragedy.
Their financial situation changes when the child is about 2, and before the adoption is final, the adoption head honchos threaten to take her away, because now they are poor.
In short, the ending is unnecessarily tragic in the little girls death alone, more so when her death splits Dunne and Grant apart, and ruined both by the fact that the couples problems are not fixed at the end of the movie, just papered over, and the treatment of a loss of a child as something a kin to the loss of a goldfish.
Basically, if you stop the movie at the Christmas when the girl is six, it is not bad, it's a cute film, though not worth its rave reviews.
My grandmother introduced me to this movie when I was a child.
Intelligent and moving, PENNY SERENADE is a perfect reminder of just how effective sentiment can be when crafted with high expertise and professionalism.
They marry, and when he gets a career break as a reporter in Japan, she joins him and announces her pregnancy.
And if this town is so small, how come she and the main character do not know each other before this night when she just walks up out of the darkness?
Buchanan is Grant's good friend who comes to work as a pressman when Grant starts a small town newspaper after coming home from the Orient.
I watched this film before Christmas when TV decides to play movies all day long and I get very easily distracted.
I cried when Irene Dune couldn't have children anymore, I cried when The adoption baby was bought out and I sobbed and sobbed when the little girl died.
It's at this juncture in their life when Roger and Julie decide to adopt.
Roger, who wanted a boy, has an emotional encounter with a judge that wants to take the girl away from him and Julie when his paper folds.
Near the end, when the couple is ready to divorce because they couldn't handle this tragedy, another baby is offered to them, they accept and live happily ever after.
1) I thought this movie was a great depiction of many small town people and their lives when they turn teenagers.
He becomes motivated to leave when his friend, who was supposed to go with him, dies.
I also didn't like how her mom went and told Joey she was really a guy she should have let Gwen do that when she was ready to.
I loved it when I first saw it and I still enjoy it.
Every scene, every line, every shot, every frame seems as right today as when this film was released.
I dislike the man and his decisions, but why make him into a plain old jackass when he was an effective and charismatic user of people?
And under such obvious direction: "Smile when the light goes across", "Look up after a second", "React with surprise" and so on, making the actors seem like puppets sometimes.
We see some expected things like a big press conference, but we also see things that ring so true that they feel so real as minor events, like when the scientists are showing the astronauts the pod without a window or proper escape hatch and they all band together to put pressure on them to do it right or else the press will hear all hell (the wording in this scene is very good).
The Right Stuff takes place during the Cold War when America was trying its hardest in technological advancements to beat the Russians.
Not even a broken rib could hold him back when an opportunity to fly the X-1 was offered.
The entire world changes when the Russians launch Sputnik, in 1957.
Witness general crawling on the floor to plug in the projector, the sounds of the locusts when the press surrounds the astronauts (Yeager called them locusts initially), the Halleluiah Chorus during the press conference, the enema scene, Sheppard needing to take a leak in the suit, Johnson trying to deal with a housewife.
lol when the two canucks try to hit D-Von on either side of the head with two steel chairs, he ducks and they bash off each other.
the ref gets knocked out so he can't count to 3 when Triple H lands the pedigree.
I first saw this film on the Arts and Entertainment channel (A&E) in the 1960s when i was teaching in Montserrat.
I was fourteen years of age when I first saw this film.
I first heard about this movie when I was living down south and a friend of mine mentioned it to me.
Later Lazaro is caught by fisherman and taken to a church and that's when the story takes a twisting turn that I found very interesting and thoughtful.
The film mix religion and mysticism when tells the history of a boy created in the Amazonian forest that is taken to be educated in an orphanage.
The tram starts when an American missionary, the idealistic priest Mahoney (the actor Peter Horton) - that works in the region where the waters of the River Amazon becomes black -, knows a mysterious and sensual woman.
Some years later, when Lazaro is about ten or so, he is then found and brought to the city where his father's mentor vows to care for him and make him civilised.
But Lazaro is more intent in revenge when he sees the man who killed his mother...
to whether we have a right to seek vengeance when we are wronged to environmental issues (the cutting down of the rain forests).
But when I see a drama and the story or events are so gripping that I get involved with the characters and cry for them and with them, then that is a really good movie.
The problem was when after finishing seeing the movie i went back and saw the first minutes, and then... oh boy did i cried.
when Seita sees her mother, dead and wrapped in bandages with the maggots and bugs crawling all over), and at the same time there's a sense of wonderment as the two children watch the fireflies in the shelter.
Each time a layer of emotional defense is peeled back, it becomes harder not to connect strongly with these characters, such as when Seiko casually says she knows her mother is dead as she buries the fireflies and Seita finally cries out for the first time, or when Seita is left broken and humiliated after being beat up by the farmer for stealing food for sick Setsuko.
The scene that really got me was when Setsuko died, and the images of her life are shown.
Particularly the part where it shows her playing by herself when her brother was out finding food.
So when we reach the end of the movie, with an image of them as spirits, sitting on a bench looking happy and healthy, with a modern day city around them, this is actually a happy ending after all the suffering they went through.
So there shouldn't really be any surprises when I say that "Grave of the Fire Flies" is not ranked among my list of all time favourites.
It is the tiny moments which give this film so much power and emotional depth - from subtle expressions to brief scenes showing Seito playing with his sister at bath time, attempting, unsuccessfully, to cheer her up when she misses her mother.
(Spoiler warning)  One of my favorite scenes is the sequence when Seito gets caught for stealing and is taken to the police, thus forced to abandon his little sister.
It is my sincere opinion that Akiyuki Nosaka's motives were far purer when he wrote this.
When a film is done without a camera, when acting is without seeing your actors, and when cinematography is but a pencil line, you have to think about how to rate such a movie.
It gets worse when you see the corpse being riddled of its possessions by a security guard.
Their fatal struggle for survival begins right at the start, when both are bombed out of house and home by American B-29s.
Auntie, a cold, bitter, self-serving woman, has no patience with Seita or Setsuko, especially when they would rather chase after fireflies at moonlight, play by the beach, or lounge around the house instead of helping out.
Rhoda Chrosite's Setsuko is the one voice that doesn't fare so well; she sounds more like an adult pretending to be a young girl, and comes across as strained during most scenes (save for when she is sick from diarrhea).
I first saw this film when I first really got into anime in High School.
We sat through the whole thing without saying a word, then when the movie was over we didn't even talk.
Seeing a movie like this really changes attitudes about war - about who really suffers, and that the honor and glory is shallow comfort when you contemplate what has been lost in the struggle.
I've also read it argued that the movie is robbed of any suspense or impact when it's revealed in the opening scene that the main characters are dead.
Probably two thirds of the movie takes place in gorgeously drawn, tranquil rural or urban settings, with an almost pleasant dreamlike quality - even when the American bombers are flying overhead at one point there is a surreal, almost serene sense to it - and there are plenty of moments of happiness to offset the undeniably sadness and frustration of other scenes.
At first I winced when I heard this show has the tag-line of banality, namely "A Sci-Fi Channel Original".
Yet when I saw the concept I had hope.
I can't imagine the appeal in seeing the SAME characters in new and lame reality-show style competitions and being overly melodramatic at the end when someone gets voted off.
It brought me back to a time in my life when people would constantly tell me "these are the best times of your life" when actually I thought they were some of the most confusing and difficult times!
Right from the get go you know your in la la land when the rangers jump out of a Hercules transport at dawn somewhere over the mideast, but then after a water landing they surface in the dark!
when trains are involved!
It gives the production values a real blow when you can't even afford a decent costume designer.
Don't get me wrong though I liked the show, saw most of it in one night when Sci-Fi aired a bunch of episodes straight.
So I was thrilled when they made a movie about it.
I remember when I read the book, I had tears rolling down my cheeks because I was laughing so hard.
From the very credits with the view of the Notre Dame Cathedral and the surroundings of the Seine River when the sounds of larks and pigeons mix with the sounds of crows, it all appears to be, as if, a moving work of art that you look at in perfect admiration and astonishment.
The three memorably reach the "top notch" performances at the end when emotions are riding to the highest degrees...
Zefferelli, who has long claimed he had a friendship with her and in truth he had been behind various opera productions of hers, had Maria Callas in mind when he cast Teresa Stratas.
The Callas connection is most obvious when Stratas appears in a black veiled gown in Act 2 at Flora's party where even her hair is similar to Callas' infamous 50's performances.
They were not even there for her when she was dying in the finale.
A time of youth and innocence when the realities of life were still on the distant horizon.
A time when your desire for something more in life made you leave the security of friends and family and race to that distant horizon and beyond, to embrace all the possibilities and make them your own.
Verdi outdid himself when he penned La Traviata.
I first heard about "Cha Fa Nui" (Camille) from the mouth of my mother when I was still an upper primary school girl.
The histrionic and comical fit of Alfredo when he was struggle to open that fateful letter from Violetta.
But Bugs' point is precisely this - the Awards pretentiously think that they are rewarding high art, when these great actors are locked in stereotype and received image.
It would touch on elements, and then discard them, and when it did explore them, it was so superficial it was like hearing a good joke told by someone with no timing.
The actor who played Kristen's love interest Erlend was 45 years old when the movie was made in 1995.
If you are past your youth, this will remind you of your younger time, when you had choices to make that would shape your destiny.
In Universal's film, Hattie McDaniel plays with less dignity, but still shows some anger when the white man demands return of his jewelry.
Even when this series it's too short (just 26 episodes) it have very much to offer .
I think the best way to begin this would be not to thank but to bear hug,the creative geniuses who created this piece of art..i mean everything about this show is f**king perfect-the characters,the plot,the direction,the music,the screenplay,the script..Its a perfect example of when all the things come together to make something that is larger than the creators themselves..I don't know how i stumbled across the page of cowboy bebop but it must have one my lucky days..I have to say i was not intrigued from the plot as much as from the characters,which i read about in the comments..my expectations from the show were pretty low despite the rating but man when i watched its first two episodes,even the 9.4 rating seemed an insult..and IT IS THAT GOOD..you would filled with awe for its creators after you watch it..you would even love the cowboy bebop sign that comes in between the show..The best thing about the show is that is has no specific genre,or you can say its a genre in itself..i wont have the slightest doubt if the show gets a cult status..so you never know whats gonna come out in the next scene,whether you will be convulsing with laughter or staring at the screen in empathy for one of the characters..as the show goes on and on,you keep on going deep into the skin of the characters..you don't know when it happens that the characters just occupy a permanent space in your head..you start to wish that they are always around..with a bored spike smoking his cigarette,jet watering his plants ,sulky faye with her frown and industrious ed jumping around with his laptop..and when the show ended,i actually felt a part of my life going away..and i bet you will feel the same way when the show ends..you will stare into the eyes of spike and say " no this is not going to happen,i wont let you go"..its a rare feeling for someone in real life but its almost impossible for someone in reel life..  so my respect to shinichiro wantanbe from the bottom of my heart for directing the show so perfectly and congratulations to hajami yatate for writing something so perfect in itself..and kobayashi and yoko kanno,no man i ain't forgetting them either..the show wouldn't have been complete without their music which encompasses everything from jazz to metal to blues to country to electronic..I urge everyone who reads this comment to watch this show..doesn't matter if you're not an anime fan..this show is apiece of art and it must not be missed..and if you're an anime fan,then you wont be seeing something as great as this in a long time..i guess if you take my word,then you're in for one of your luckiest days of your life..  SEE YOU IMDb COWBOY..
So mankind lives in space and like we always do manage to mess up even space and have criminals running rampant, which is when Spike and Jet are called in to take down these criminals who run away.
Just when you think they forgot something or just had a random episode they come back to it and prove you wrong.
He is a good person but don't count on him to be your guardian angel when you need him most.
She was in a coma and when she woke up, she remembered nothing, not even her own name.
Marge and Gower Champion are in fine form in their numbers, and you can't help but smile during "Life Upon the Wicked Stage," when Marge wears skirts hiked higher than Aly McBeal's... in the 50s!
It starts out as a typical chicks in prison movie then when they get bored of that it becomes a 'buddy movie'.
Hammer, Amicus and Tigon combined produced the vast majority of British horror movies during this period and helped to keep the industry alive in the 1970s when American investment dried up.
And when any are killed, their friends soon forget about them.
There are long periods of time when nothing is happening.
Those wanting to see a proper British horror movie should do themselves a favour by seeking one out from the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s when we had proper talent in this field.
The going into dark deserted areas when something is chasing you (in this case a freaking demon!).
i like the way that the scenes are shot (especially when the 'demon' (djinn) is chasing each of the group of friends and the atmosphere is totally frightening and sinister.
The movie starts off introducing us to some student housemates, and there lives, quickly cutting off to a night out clubbing, and that is when the problems begin.
Growing bored they decide to use and ouija board to contact dead spirits, but get more than they bargained for when they summon a fire demon.
When you think about it there arent that many films that involve Ouiji boards which is quite suprising when this activity is one of the most terrifyingly mysterious known.
No offence to British film-makers, hey I'm British, but they are usually very, very bad at creating horror films, so I didn't really know what to expect when I went to see this film, but it got into the cinema so it must be worth it, with the exception of, 'Jay and Silent Bob strike back!'
A group of friends are out partying one night, when they decide to try out an Oujia board and contact some spirits.
Oh I love it when the bad guys win!!!!
Long Time Dead opens to a caption that informs us that we're in 'Morocco 1979' where a group of people are holding a sÃ©ance which gets out of hand when a fire demon called a Djinn appears & supposedly kills everyone... Long Time Dead then cuts to present day London where four house-mates, Rob (Joe Absolom), Liam (Alex Newman), Webster (Lukas Haas) & Stella (Lara Belmont) are planning to go out for the night.
There is another scene in particular I keep thinking about that sums Long Time Dead & it's silly script up, when two people break into a police guarded house & turn the lights on only for the police officer on guard to be conveniently looking in the opposite direction & only looking back at the house literally seconds after the lights have been turned off.
A random group of young adults who are some combination of roommates/friends takes time out from their busy partying schedule to play with an improvised Ouija board, when they accidentally call forth a djinn who tells them that they will all die.
Whats the name of the song (tune) that plays when Havilland enters Lee's room and starts going through his things.
The song later plays when she returns to her home and reads Lee's letter and goes through the flashbacks of New Years.
remember when you would hear a song & try to claim it before anyone else saying "that's my jam"?
i myself just happened to stumble across this one when doing the typical back and forth at the blockbuster a few years back.
I saw Hav Plenty when it was first released back in 1997 and i still feel about it today the same as i did when i left out of the theater back in '97.
I love The Firesign Theater, so the other night when I was browsing through the On Demand sections on TV and saw this movie listed and featuring two of the troupe, plus other guys I generally like like Harry Shearer and Fred Willard, I thought I'd check it out.
Almost a novelty when it was introduced to film in the early 1920's, Technicolor reached its zenith in the 1940's and 50's, when classics like WIZARD OF OZ, THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD, SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON, SNOW WHITE and GONE WITH THE WIND were released using the brilliant, deeply-saturated hues of dye-transfer Technicolor.
As usual Gary proves able to sculpt a sympathetic protagonist who is able to win over the audience into rooting for him regardless of the sometimes violent methods he uses to defeat his foes and here his vengeance against the criminal fraternity who destroyed his family and friends is nothing short of apocalyptic.As well as the superb physical skills that Gary brings to his performances he is capable of portraying strong human emotions also.He is always very effective indeed in scenes involving children and it can be no accident that he is often cast as a father in his films.Martial arts are absent from this tale until the final thirty minutes and when they finally appear in a series of brutal and superbly well choreographed fights you realise that you are watching a master at work.There are simply no current screen martial arts stars (Chinese,European or American)who could have brought what Gary Daniels brings to this role.This is a movie that should be sought by anyone who professes to enjoy action and if they enjoyed it half as much as I did then it won't be long before they seek out other Gary Daniels movies.They won't be disappointed,if anyone working in this genre delivers the kind of energy that Gary Daniels does in every role then they are being very quiet about it.Keep the British flag flying Gary for there isn't any young actor in the UK today who looks as if they even have the strength to even lift the flag up.Only the US is capable of producing a movie like RECOIL and long may they continue.
There is absolutely no doubt as to what is going to happen next, and very, very little as to when or where.
I originally saw it when I was nine, and had nightmares for six weeks, thereafter.

Cut to Mrs. Edwards startled face when she hears Penny screaming in the living room.

I loved Darkwing Duck when I was 5 years old and I still love it now!
It's interesting how most cartoons from childhood seem lame when I watch them now but Darkwing Duck remains funny and entertaining.
Overall I think Darkwing Duck was one of the most original and interesting cartoons to emerge from the early 90's and when contrasted with today's cartoons it has a very different approach that makes it unique.
I think everyone has shows they look back on with nostalgia, comparing them to what's on TV today and thinking, "Cartoons were so much better when I was a kid!"
I was only two years old when the show was released, but growing up I caught nearly all of the episodes in reruns on Disney.
Every time I watch any part of it, I lose the number of puns and jokes delivered (when I try to count) - they just go on and stumble one onto another.
I remember having a Megavolt action figure, I don't remember what happened to him, but when I found out he was voiced by Dan Castellanetta (Homer Simpson), I really, really wanted that action figure back!
Back in the day when the Disney brand was a force to be dealt with and not just another brand name, there was a cartoon called "Darkwing Duck", chronicling the adventures of the title Batman wannabe, his adopted daughter Gosalyn, and his crash-prone partner, Launchpad.
I remember that I was on cloud nine when I'd rush (run) home from school and catch this on the tail end of the Disney Afternoon.
Her scene in the dressing room when she realizes Magnolia is on stage singing "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" was truly heartbreaking, especially when she starts drinking.
Her "Bill" was also really quite moving (although dubbed by Annette Warren,) especially when she acknowledges that her ring finger no longer has a wedding ring on it.
I wasn't  sure that there weren't in fact a few professional actors in the cast -- there were some moments when the content came across as more drama than  documentary; several scenes felt staged.
But how do we really feel when we face that real freedom in real life shaped around the society's morals and values?
Bunuel asks the question of why do we follow traditional social norms when we aren't even sure why they were created?
He would analyze ones desires, urges, thoughts, social behavior, and when we go deep to ourselves, we discover that, yes, we do have thoughts similar to what we see in his film but, most of us, we keep them to ourselves because we are afraid to voice them loud out.
Some of the ideas in this film were brilliant, such as when they all sit down at the dining room except they are all toilets instead of normal chairs.
From the beginning, he plays with his audience, building up our expectations and when we think something might happen, he leaves us stunned and laughing, showing by way of absurdity and satire things we never would have thought possible because of the preconceptions we have demonstrating that we are not as free thinking and open as we thought we were.
For myself, a particular favorite from this film would be when the professor lectures on morals and so forth, and BuÃ±uel cuts to a sequence where the kitchen and bathroom swap roles Â both brilliant and comedic!
This movie is definitely not normal, it is really a bunch of shorts put together, each transition is just a character followed to another scene and can at times seem confusing; because its right when that short climax's and you are about to find out, and then it switches and you are on to the next one.
But when it does, it is for a reason.
Such as an early scene where some parents look at pictures and deem them 'disgusting' when they are just pictures of buildings.
One where a sniper shoots many people, and when tried in court and found guilty, is sentenced to death.
My favourite scene is when a couple are told to go to their daughter's school, because she has vanished.
The teacher who makes this self-reflection moreover has much in common with Bunuel, so for example, when he criticizes the standard level of human life in Spain Â as Bunuel did in an interview.
Bunuel's movie was released in 1974, thus just at the time when Pier Paolo Pasolini started to film his last work "Salo", in which (amongst many other marvelous events) there is the famous or infamous scene where people are forced to eat faeces.
And go see it live when you have the chance.
The key to the movie is the segment dealing with the naughty gendarmes,the sociology teacher and Margaret Mead's books.Law must not be taken for granted,it depends on where and when you live.Something which would seem unbearable to us is nothing but natural to other human beings.The whole movie walks this fine line,being built around this very concept.It is Bunuel's most accessible movie and it's completely mad,which is fine with me.Its construction is not unlike Max Ophuls's "la ronde" (1950) as a new character provides the connection between the segments.It's not really free-form ,in the sense of the nouvelle vague ,nothing Godardesque here and anyway,Bunuel possessed something Jean-Luc will never have:humor.And the screenplay displays care and respect for the audience.One should point out Jean-Claude CarriÃ¨re's importance in Bunuel's last works in France.
A bevy of great actors take us to a magical mystery tour (Bunuel's regret was that too many movies lack mystery) Here he focused on the secret of the passage of the night hours ,wherever the action takes place ,in Brialy's and Vitti's bedroom or the inn where the guests are weird to say the least (the scenes in the inn recall those of "la voie lactÃ©e,1969).And the ostrich in the couple's room ,we find it back at the zoo,for the finale,when repression rises.When we bury our head in the sand ,French people call it "ostrish politics"!
My favorite bits are when a little girl goes along with her parents to the police station to report that she has been missing for some time and when the military is brought into a zoo to keep the people away from the animals.
Anyone who has seen this movie will agree with me that love when your young does not happen in the way portrayed in this movie.
The movie didn't address the race issue (which was half the point of its predecessor) and the conflict was a creation of the main character's head where she decided her boyfriend lied to her when in fact he never did.
So I was THRILLED when the film moved from this school to the offices of a magazine editor played by Brent.
However, when she came to work the next day, Brent's character was such a ridiculous and impossible to believe jerk that the film really began to spiral downward very quickly.
This sort of extreme and stupid behavior continued from then on, such as when they went out to eat at a vegetarian restaurant, go for long, long walks in the middle of pouring rain and talk on and on and on (ad nauseum) about "right living and exercise".
Even allowing for the fact that anyone can make a fool of him/herself when it comes to love, Fred's abrupt changes of heart, especially the first volt face when he decides to employ Maizie, left me a little puzzled.
A nice clue is given in the scene where Fred follows Carole to the secretarial school and in response to he snappish `I'm busy' he sharply retorts, `I never saw you when you weren't'.
This element is of course present in the scenes between Carole and Maizie, the latter being as unpleasant and manipulative as the audience needs her to be in order that we do not need to worry about her (or Fred's treatment of her) when she is ultimately dispatched (landing on her feet in any event).
By way of historical background, there was minimal law and order in Nome at this time, when thousands arrived each month in the summer.
She seems to disapprove of the claim jumping operations, especially when they involve Roy.
The rest of the film however is in a minor key when compared with the earlier sound version with Allan Jones and Irene Dunne.
So when it turns out that he is the villain, it's a genuine surprise (for the longest time, I kept thinking that he'd have one of those Hollywood conversions right at the end and help Wayne to set things right before dying in a hail of gunfire).
Maybe he just didn't age well (he was only 47 when this film was made but looked older).
The only odd thing is that the Duke is billed 3rd when it is clearly his film.
He certainly looked more age-appropriate than William Haines in West Point, and Haines was five years Novarro's junior when that film was made.
There were times when their treatment of Novarro was revolting, but yet they seemed good fellows at the end--how true in life.
It was abominable in some scenes, particularly when one had the already daunting task of penetrating thick Italian accents.
However, the fact that its reach exceeded its grasp should be no surprise when one considers that MGM through second-rate films destroyed the careers of its leading silent actors Gilbert, Haines, Keaton, and yes, Ramon Novarro.
In particular is the exchange between her and Wayne when he appears at Cherry's in blackface.
Him and his team have just pulled off the most daring robbery of their careers, when some masked mobsters rudely muscle in on his operation and try to make him hand over a briefcase, which, unbeknownst to him, contains a priceless Van Gogh painting that may be a fake.
It is difficult to get much solemnity out of a sports film, especially when sprinkled with such ludicrous scenes as Novarro drunk in a public restroom or fist fighting with his coach.
Sure, we all like gunfights and explosions, but when the movie mainly contains an opening scene and then people having flashbacks of that same scene (I think I counted this happening about 3 times) then it starts to get a bit dull.
As a sidebar when ever I see a Wesley Snipes movie I amuse myself with Wesley's ability to bed white women on screen.
Rent it or watch it when it airs on T.V.
Last but not the least, when an action movie does not have much story to show, usually there are lots of cars chase in the script, for the pride and joy of the stunts (there are exceptions, of course, like "Ronin", "The Blues Brothers", "The Transporter " and others).
just when you think the storyline is going to pick up they start showing you flashbacks of scenes earlier in the movie which you've already scene a thousand times !
This wasn't bad at all, apart from the fact that the sheriff must have been naively optimistic in thinking that he, a deputy and an old-timer could prevail against two different factions each consisting of a score or so men; in the event, he leaves it far too late when it comes to asking for outside help.
In both films the sheriff doesn't have much support when it comes to conscientiously doing his duty.The suspense mounts through both films, though John Agar doesn't match Gary Cooper when it comes to re-acting to it.
I see from other comments that I'm not alone in finding the repetitive ballad-singer an irritation; I almost cheered when he dashed for cover during a shoot-out; what a pity he didn't get in the way of a bullet.
And when someone gets knocked on the head it's out of camera shot, which I thought was a convention that had been done away with some years before the film was made.
I saw this movie in England when it first came out and it has stayed with me ever since.
I know it's not the exact line, but when, after completing the "I Shot an Arrow Into the Air" poem, Sara tells him to "Keep the Faith," I was almost hoping for her to call him Brooks - again see Shawshank.
She was in probably the best scene in the movie, when they were sampling her DNA, the thing with the cigarette, Magnificent.
Few will remember that he took the lead role when "The King and I" first came to London at Drury Lane (I think) and that he was the natural choice for the Harry Lime role in the radio version of "The Third Man" (circa, 1951).
i have to say i was a little skeptical at first when we paid a dollar to rent this movie, but no doubt it will find it's way into my DVD rack sometime soon.
And regardless of how deeply the characters can inflect based on their accents, some of their visual expressions are really wonderful (my favorite was when the guy in the paddy-wagon grabs the sticks of dynamite!).
However when the film works- which it does at the ends and for a chunk of the middle, this is some of the best film making I've seen this year so far.
Our story takes place in the present of the whites and reds, when their rivalry is still alive.
Here is when the man with no name or the Sanjuro of our story enters, a man that comes from nowhere but seems that he arrives in the right time for the people in the town.
Here a family story is also shown, with a couple that when they get married they forget about the clans but now the woman is going to avenge the dead of his husband by joining the clan of the whites.
I don't remember when was the first time that I hear something about this film but since then and when I saw the trailer it becomes for me the film to check this year.
Anyway, for Miike, this is typically violent fare Â even more pointless than usual and all rather amateurishly assembled; besides, having the actors speak English results in unintentional laughter more than anything else (though Quentin Tarantino's absurd cameo is no less embarrassing: incidentally, I may well have been witness to the genesis of the picture back when these two mavericks 'butted heads' at the 2004 Venice Film Festival!).
With characterization tending towards mere posture (when it is not insipid), we are left with a clutch of stylized-but-hollow action sequences to grab the attention Â all of which, ultimately, leaves a bad taste in the mouth.
It does make for sometimes rather herky jerky deliveries on the part of the actors, but when you consider that the whole film is paying loving homage to a great tradition of films by the likes of Leone and others, which usually featured overdubbing, often by other actors even, it seems almost fitting that the dialog delivery in "Sukiyaki" is what it is.
Compared to Miike's others, Sukiyaki Western is like Bambi when it comes to gore and dementia.
Like the other reviews said, the spoken word of the movie can be very hard to understand since the actors are speaking a language other than their native tongue, but when I turned on the subtitles, they turned out to be almost completely nonsensical!
SUKIYAKI WESTERN DJANGO, while it boasts some incredible production values (from the town itself to the pyrotechnics to some absolutely beautiful cinematography), suffers badly when it comes to story (YOJIMBO has been emulated so many times over the years that it must be tied with MOST DANGEROUS GAME by now) and character (it's impossible to pull for the hero because he's rarely little more than a bit player; we never get to know him to the degree that we do, say, Toshiro Mifune in YOJIMBO and SANJURO).
Not everything he tries works, but when it does, it can be pretty damn awesome.
Meanwhile, he tends to get good performances from his actors, even when they are children or non-native Japanese speakers.
So, when I found out one of his 2007 films, "Sukiyaki Western Django", was in English, I was a bit put off.
Honestly, when you cut away all the fluff, the story boils down to a three-way war between the two clans and a couple of expert gunslingers.
There are great tragic comic scenes like when a man tries to catch a sword that is going through his head, or when an enormous hole is made on a man.
It's really bad, probably as bad when Quentin Tarantino speaks little bits of Japanese in this film to a native Japanese speaker.
In a time when ridiculously unoriginal films are hailed by critics and average viewers alike, it's great to see something truly different come to the screen.
The comic parts are mostly from the portrayal of south and north (the north officer always stand on the left,north Korean soldiers' arrogance...) I love the ending very much, when Admiral Lee's 13 ships had to face the 300 ships from Japan (a real battle in history which Koreans won), he motivated his sailors: as we are united, there's nothing can stop us.
Its not going to win any awards, but for a good babysitting movie, or ever something to do when you're bored, you really can't mess this one up.
However when he finally is shown it's a huge disappointment.
But when the two Koreas decide to hand over the warhead to the United States, North Korean military officer Kang Min Gil (Kim Seung Woo) decides to take matters into his own hands and not only steal the weapon with the help of a band of private soldiers but kidnap the female South Korean scientist (Kong Hyo Jin) who helped create it as well!
In conclusion, this is in no way a film to spend money on, except perhaps via your electricity bill when it's shown, inevitably late at night as filler in between phone-in quiz shows and news programs.
That surprise was because it was shown on Turner Classic Movies--a channel that rarely has nudity but even when it does, there's far less than in this film.
What I would like to know, though, is how this lady not only knew what she and her boyfriend were doing (this mostly involved getting naked and her saying 'she wasn't THAT kind of girl' when he later wanted to have sex?!?)
Oh, and by the way, this isn't a huge plot problem because they guy was not supposed to be a forensics expert, but at the beginning when the two men discover the massacre, one says to the other "how long have they been dead?".
Don't listen to the other reviewers when they say this film would have been better if it had been made with today's effects and a larger budget.
This film becomes better because it was made on a tighter budget, when the crew had to come up with inventive ways to create atmosphere, menace and a sustained mood.
There's a great scene with some funny dialogue that's worth a mention, when the group arrive on the island and Brent disappears.
It was a great shock to me when I found that this film is given an average of 5.7 .I think it deserves to be in the top 50 movies.It is a great movie with great directing,story,crew and great performance by Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston.The songs also are incredible.
I saw this movie when it was first released and didn't really care for it.
I gave this movie another try when it came on Cinemax and recorded it on tape.
There's a point in the movie, when they realize their romance, when their reactions don't make any sense, but afterward everything about the movie plays out like it should and it's well made!
I could fill pages with examples, but the one that made me really sorry that I had sacrificed my beauty sleep to watch this was when Costner's character dives into a freezing lake to knock a kid out of a boat, but for no apparent reason other than he just figure out that the bad guy is nearby.
We have often heard of what happens when love blossoms in the work place and this film is no exception to that rule.
A great scene is when the heroes go to the Firehouse BBQ and risk their life against the zombies for just one more tasty chicken wing.
Also, when the only person alive in the police station tells the TV reporter to turn the SEC football game back on, it made me realize this cast injected some real southern dialogue into a Zombie movie.
The movie changes tone midway when the girls find out the men are wanted.
Shows you how bad a film like RANGERS is when you find yourself asking questions like that .
I won`t finish on the old cliche that I wasted ninety minutes of my life on this crap because I only wasted thirty minutes of my life on it as I turned it off when the guy got blown out of the window
and the somewhat corny dialog such as "i am for you Sulu" when the program comes to take her next victim.
So the TWS Spock can dish out sarcasm, but is too dim too detect it from others, or at least to recognize a common phrase when he hears one.
At the end, Kirk and co. even engage in quasi-slapstick, when they keep changing the order of how they stand to avoid being touched by the strange pacifistic-yet-murdering alien woman/robot.
Spock jumps on every comment that every person says, correcting their calculations with comments like "I wish you'd be more accurate" and saying things like "We're not here to engage in gambling" when someone asks about their odds of survival (how many times has Spock himself spewed out odds of this and that in the past?
His own mother had to cut him off at the knees when he did that once).
Though it has to be said, when Compo died, so did the show.
Wilde played the part until 1997, when he picked up an ailment, so he was forced to retire.
Best Episode: It is one of the two part episodes "The Great Boarding House Bathroom Caper" and "Cheering up Gordon", which is about when Compo, Clegg, Foggy, Sid, Ivy and Gordon(Compo's nephew) go on holiday to Scarbourgh, only to find Nora Batty and husband Wally are staying in the same boarding house.
I loved Last of the Summer Wine in the early 1990's when I was a kid and really enjoyed the mischief Compo, Clegg and Foggy got up to.
Another priceless gem was when Seymour, Compo and Clegg try and help Howard escape, and their inflatable boat sinks, and all four men end up in the river.
it's not as good as resident evil but it's still a 10 i did not even get scared when it came on sci channel last week long advertisement though but it was still awesome though that was the best movie i saw that had zombies cause it had a lot of light and the dude who wrote it if your on here good job dude.Shaun of the dead was good to.la.la.la.Ad.Ad.Ad.brass monkey junkie that monkey monkey.
The above rating is for the mid-'70's to mid-80's shows, when 'Last Of The Summer Wine' was at its peak in my view.
I made some wonderful friends on the series too, Jane Freeman (who played my Auntie Ivy), Bill Owen (who i sadly miss) Peter Sallis (who taught me so much when we worked on stage together) Thora Hird (who told great stories of her early life in the Co-op as a sales assistant) Joe Gladwyn (who told me the most wonderful tales of early music hall and variety shows) to name just a few...
This screenplay is quite interesting, and when Angelina Jolie leans ahead of the dead body and says "Billy, you really got what you deserved this time", you're thinking "oh, nice plot-twist".
Therefore, when the only thing that remains in both these characters is the love for each other, and when they have left their jobs, friends, integrity, and should I say, mental sanity (because they become guilty of murder) to stay with each other, you can pretty much guess that from there the movie can become vulgar and raw.
Which it does, when Angelina turns into a prostitute again at the end - not a least bit worried by the love she says she carries for "Luis" - and offers herself to 4 or 5 men, while she already has a relationship with Luis and one with her pimp.
Considering the film's title and cover I expected a type of Zalman King thriller when I rented this movie.
Jolie pulls her weight, too, giving glimpses of just enough vulnerability to temper the extreme mean streak her character exhibits, not least when she attempts to kill her husband not once, but twice.
My favorite moments in the movie is when the two Luis and Julia are arguing in the hotel and Luis goes into a rage telling julia how much he loves her and the last few scenes in the movie when Julia poisons Luis' coffee and Luis practically pours his heart out before willingly drinking the poison telling Julia he loves all of her good and bad inspite of all the hell she put him through(I even cried a little.
Julia Russell (Jolie), from Delaware, as a reply, sends her photograph & when he finally meets Julia on their wedding day, he is left breathless by her beauty & smoldering sexuality.
By now, Luis has given has wife access to bank accounts, and when she runs with his cash, he pursues her, with the help of Downs, the P.I., perhaps to kill her.
Any viewer who likes settings and images from slightly earlier times owes it to themselves to look for Original Sin in their local rental shop because it is a wonderful film that seemed to slip by the reviewers when it was released.
But when Vargas's new bride suddenly disappears, the businessman discovers that his life is now totally based in her.
Likewise, the dependably silent/aloof Antonio Banderas was even harder to locate when it came to any promotion of the film.
Banderas' portrayal makes it hard not to hurt when Vargas hurts or trust when he trusts.
My friends and I still quote lines from it and we still get together and watch it when we have our zombie movie get togethers.
Pedro is a brute of a man, hence the title of the movie, but he faces the reality of what he is doing when he becomes close to the daughter of the man that he accidentally killed under his assignment from Don Andres.
At one point, when Pedro is running through the alleyways, there is a shot of him running in one direction, and his shadow, through trick lighting, clearly runs in a completely different direction, going down a different alleyway.
It is amusing to a certain extent to see as the relatively young Israeli cinema matures, the French cinema with its long tradition seems to repeat the mistakes of the older Israeli cinema - trying to tell too much in one movie, schematic and stereotype representation of the characters, temptation of folklorist approach when dealing with the Jewish customs, and too little characters development.
I remember when I watched this with my sisters, the oldest said to me that Hindustan people aren't gonna like it because the hero is falling in love with a British (white) girl.
He didn't love her but had to obey his parents when they said "marry her", because of tradition.
Hide and Creep is what you get when you give a couple of hillbillies a camera.
In this movie this purpose is achieved when Kisna , his friend Vivek Mushran and friend's wife Hrishitaa Bhatt (endearing character) give Catherine a crash course in Hindu culture .
Rajat Kapoor : Such a fine actor , here he plays an evil prince Raghuraj who wants to marry Catherine even when he is her father's age .
when i left the hall i gave the maker benefit of the fact that my expectations were too huge.
Hide and Creep is what you get when you give a couple of hillbillies a camera.
Here in the Age of Innocence, Scorsese depicts (with the help of Edith Wharton's novel) of a time in New York when things when things were elegant, though also brutal in the deep.
What happens when you find your "true love" and it is not the person you are married to...in 1870s NYC...whoops.
How can zombies ever get respect when losers like Bruno Mattei and morons who get their hands on cameras make crap like this.
How do these people get the funding to make these craporama's when there have to be more talented filmmakers out there who can't even get a foot in the door?
I watch this film over and over when I need a break from the mundane films that are pumped out on an assembly line known as Hollywood.
For some reason when they parachute from the Hercules in the beginning and hit water it changes from day to night in under 30 seconds and some how they have rubber dingies with huge boat engines that someone had to have had in they're pocket and blew up, because is isn't visible that anyone had any packages when the dove out from the plane.
then when they hit land, for some reason they dress up as hobo's while they're still carrying around M4's and Ak's, while trying to be under cover.This is soon followed by the Rangers wandering around the streets taking they're hobo-taskic costumes off, after they only had them on for about 3 minutes, you can't blame them, this film is such a steaming pile of crap I would've refused to dress like a jack-ass.
Scorcese uses a tremendous amount of visual tricks to emphasize what or whom we should look at: spotlighting Pfeiffer and Day-Lewis as they enjoy a quiet conversation during the intermission in a play; overlapping series of fleeting images from snippets of correspondence between characters; slowing the action down for about five seconds in a key scene (when Pfeiffer gets up from her seat, crosses a room full of guests to go talk to Day-Lewis as Woodward narrates "It was not the custom for a lady to get up ... and talk to another man.").
Nothing is what it seems, and in the exceptional case of Winona Ryder's incredibly sly portrayal of May Welland, that becomes true: she knows much more than her character reveals, and when she does so, it's only with a loving glance.
She is aware of her husband's attraction to Ellen Olenska, and even casually feeds him into it, only to chain him to her at the end when all is revealed and nothing can be done.
I actually saw this movie when it was released in 1993, and honestly it was pretty dull then.
Can't prevent laughing when, at the end, main character says to second something like 'your daughter plays no soccer and knows no cooking'.
Serial Mom worked because we knew what we were getting into when the film was released, but since there was no real clue in the promos, it was baffling - and I love that.
We all could sense the opening ticks of a time bomb, but when Janis's ex-husband drops their daughter off at home, Janis pulls up in - WHAT ELSE - an SUV, charges at the two of them at the gate and just goes off on her poor ex, while yanking the kid and practically throwing her back in the van.
I did laugh though when one guy who was starting to "turn" tried munching on himself and a reverend also turning after being bitten, cut loose with a stream of profanity in the pulpit.
The younger sister is appalled both by the man who resorts to geisha for help and by her sister's behavior, very unsound in the insecure environment of the age when geisha with no patron had a hard time.
The destiny of the two sisters reaches its inevitable conclusion when the store clerk is fired and exacts his revenge on Omocha, and when Furusawa suddenly leaves Umekichi to become a manager of a rayon company.
One of the native girls is the banana of Lugosi's eye, and when she takes a fancy to one of the stranded song-and-dance men you can pretty much bet the guy is about to become a laboratory experiment.
I don't know who gives it that accolade, but believe me when I say they can have it.
(before the "THE END" hits the screen) and that is when Lugosi shoots Petrillo but the scene ends to quick.
You know it's bad when probably the best thing about the movie is its direction--considering it was done by William "One Shot" Beaudine--a director famous for never doing retakes even when a cameraman or microphone is clearly visible in the scene!!
For once I didn't feel victimized by the film's ending when it's revealed that the island action was all a dream.
It's really sad when your second best actor behind Lugosi is a monkey from the Tarzan movies named "Cheeta".
Also, in the 1980s, when Lewis appeared on the Today show, they ran a montage of Jerry Lewis clips from The Colgate Comedy Hour, except one clip was of Sammy Petrillo and not Jerry!
After years of hearing from film magazines about how wonderful Blue Sunshine was, I decided to give it a shot when it appeared on TV one night.
I saw this movie over twenty years ago, back when CBS showed late night movies instead of Letterman et al.
I wonder if Zalman King took some acid in 1966 and made this film in 1976 when the effects kicked in and removed his talent.
Story is about a bunch of friends who are having a party when one of them goes berserk and has his hair fall out and then proceeds to murder three women.
Aside from the beginning when a woman is shoved into a fireplace there is really no moment that make an impact.
The film has no real ending to speak of and when things are winding down a message pops up stating that a special task force was formed and that there are several more unaccounted people that have taken Blue Sunshine.
You know a film is in trouble when the main highlight is spotting a young Brion James in an early role.
A young man stands accused of murder when one of his friends goes crazy during a party.
I was livid when I eventually came across it.
The thick 70's vibe takes real control, but the cheesiness doesn't overshadow it, with a scene occurring in a groovy disco when a bald guy goes out of control because of the music.
I saw this movie when I was in the army back in the 1970s.
Watched it late night only because of the excellent James C. The most striking thing is when ever there is a violent scene, the director choose to fade out and loose all natural sound and simply play a simple but striking piece of piano.
In the meantime, Pooja has also started falling in love with Raj and when she wakes up from her coma, she identifies Raj as her husband although that is not true.
As an actor whose mission in this film is to make people laugh, he knows how to combine this aspect with some emotional expressions, such as that when Preity informs him about the new car the family gifted him, and he feels offended about that.
This would have made for a fascinating problem especially in an era when the movies was searching for relevant social problems of the period.
Taylor talks in a voice that was appropriate for "National Velvet" but certainly not 6 years later when she was older.
Even when I heard all the deadly reviews, I still wanted to buy it.
But when I learned that Steve Harris edited it, I was shocked.
In fact, when Bruce re-enters the stage and sings, other than in the rear of one camera angle YOU DON'T EVEN SEE HIM.
Iron Maiden are the absolute best when it comes to performing live, and this DVD proves it.
I will never forget the scene with Tom Conti in his cheap rooms, with "Oh Mein Papa" playing on the radio, or the young boy when asked what kind of car the family had, replied that they had feet.
And when I mean "sprung up" I mean "sprung up" because zombies appear almost out of thin air - in the church, in the video store and in a living room (where one zombie comes right through the door without any of the five people in the house seeing it and one zombie comes up from the basement where one man had said was empty not five seconds before).
This was controversial when it aired on TV.
I was only 15 when this aired and found it pretty funny--but obvious.
I was 13 when the show aired.
I was 21 when it came on, and it made me realize how wrong were things that I was so indoctrinated with that I didn't even realize it.
Some of life's more offensive moments were shown for what they were and yet simultaneously rendered hilarious when role-reversed: the executive women's nearly unconscious treatment of waiters at the local bar, for example.
That's when everyone realized that syndication became ... lucrative - but the whole point of this is that Norman Lear took advantage of the medium way early of this to express a broader artistic view of programming.
I thought it sounded interesting when I first read about it.
(Apparantly people need to be told when it's funny.)
Paul Kroll was anything but modest in his achievements even when he was sweeping cigarette butts and spent matches as a sweeper in Chicago's Wrigely Field.
This movie shows the influence of 1932, the bottom year of the Depression, when many people though all businessmen were thieves and crooks who wrecked the world's economy.
The Match King shows there is something to be said for a movie studio run like Warner Bros., a real slave labor operation where quitting time was not 5 or 6 PM, but when the day's scheduled work was done, which could be 2:00 AM the following morning.
One of the hardest working actors on the Warners lot was Warren William, but apparently when his contract was up in 1936, he went off the Warner Bros. studio payroll.
William joined a parade of other acting talent in the repertory company that Zanuck created when he was in charge of hiring actors before he quit in 1933.
However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred.
if they ever do i think they should do a reboot and leave it on for people to pay attention and get to know the characters and probably needs some fresh episodes i enjoyed it when it was on and i hope to see more of it in the future.
You realize Corey and Tuesday are going to get together, and when they finally passionately kiss that laugh track is going to give a big "WOOOOO!"
the author's son makes some comments that indicate that the book was deeper or something--but when a book is sold to Hollywood--the author gives up ownership, so to speak.
His only support is Father Roth, whom he doesn't like - he resents the church for not burying his father on hallowed ground when he committed suicide and for taking his mother's money.
The quality isn't perfect so when you rent it do not expect top of the line Romero style Zombies, it's an Independent Film and it shows.
The scene in which the white boyfriend tells jokes that has the family roaring with laughter but then suddenly frigid when one joke goes too far is highly symptomatic of the confusing problems behind the race issue: namely, that there are identifiable differences culturally between (most) blacks and (most) whites, but that some differences are more sensitive (on both sides), and that, in the end, we all wish they would go away.
I was a bit anxious at first when I heard about this remake.
His entire repertoire consists of making funny faces and acting aghast when confronted with a sitcom-like situation, which in the real world most of us would brush off as a problem barely worthy of consideration.
Even worse, there are many times when you are expecting--make that hoping--that something funny is going to happen, or someone will say something funny--but it doesn't happen.
And it seems that when they discovered this wasn't funny, they had to add some slapstick to end the scene.
Like when the sister takes a drink out of the refrigerator, shakes it up and drinks it while her mother makes a face.
The worst example of this is about 2/3 of the way through, when the two lovers run off into the night and end up telling each other how much they love each other.
And the editing is so awful at times, it makes one cringe--such as when Kutcher is climbing back into the basement.
Yes, Bernie Mac was relentless in his bullying but Ashton rarely stood up for himself and when he did, he just spoke out of the side of his mouth ....mumbling.
I cried when I thought about all the money that the filmmakers wasted on making this garbage movie.
I cried when I thought about all the money I've wasted watching utterly predictable formulaic movies as this.
I cried when I realized that I live in the greatest country in the world and some foreigner may see this film and think it's representative of American filmmakers' capacity.
I cried when I realized the stars of this movie are still employed.
However, when Charlie slapped her, I was amazed.
His charismatic presence on the screen adds a few laughs, even when the dialogue is lacking.
Although, when he is not on the screen, the film suffers.
In addition, there are a few great moments when Simon and Percy begin to acclimate to each other.
The hilarious parts involved Bernie getting his pants adjusted, Ashton teaching Bernie how to dance, the Go-Kart race and Ashton's accurate prediction of the rain and Bernie's refusing to use the windshield wipers - His character was best summed up at the hotel, when it was learned he rerserved a room from the time he knew his wife gave birth to baby girls!
Yet in the end, when Bernie got what he originally wanted, he discovered it was no longer so as he learned how much Simon/Kutcher really loved his daughter and that Simon indeed had principles even if he didn't play sports...  Opposites attract, plain and simple - Simon is businessman and Theresa is an artist...
It was wrong when her grandfather talked about his grandma like that cause i wouldn't let no one talk about my granny i would have to cut them.
Bernie Mac plays a great dad and reacts like a real father would when meeting his daughter's boyfriend for the first time.
One of my favorite lines of his was when Ashton says, "You knew you were going to kick me out a week ago?"
and Bernie replies, "Boy, I knew I was going to kick you out 24 years ago when the doctor announced it was a girl."
Ashton's acting is brilliant too, not too much, and acts out the embarrassing emotions well when he went into a black family.
is when such a traditional person realizes his fault and admits them to his wife and Ashton.
That scene shows that both sides can be racist in their own rights but still enjoy a good joke when it is truly funny.
Kutcher gets involved with "his other half", is initially terrified at meeting her father (he's better with moms), and all hilarity ensues when he and "the father with the bulging eyes and capricious temperament" get uncomfortably and frolically acquainted with one another, eventually realizing that maybe this relationship will require some self-depreciation and frenzy to eventually be accepted.
As far as the movie is concerned, I found nothing racial in it, except for the scene at the dinner table when Simon makes some racial jokes, but remember it was only a movie.
A perfect example is when Bernie Mac's character doesn't believe Ashton Kutcher's character about him knowing about the racing circuit and tests him by racing him in a go-cart, I found it extremely funny when they start to race each other and try to beat each other and land up tearing through the hedges and getting stopped by a police officer.
Another funny example is when Ashton Kutcher's character teaches Bernie Mac's character the tango and later on Bernie Mac's character denies to his wife that he was taught the tango by Ashton Kutcher's character.
Nonetheless in addition the scene when the delusional father starts physically befouling the prospective stud's mattress in an attempt to quite literally dirty him in his fiancÃ©e's eyes is perhaps one of the lowest points of cinema in the last hundred years.
How even when we try to make love, we have no words for it.
He supports a family back home and wants them to join him in Buenos Aires when he saves up enough money.
The renegade time lord, Berusa, controls the mind of the fifth doctor, when he works out that Berusa is up to something, in attempt to gain immortality, so that he can be the Lord President of Gallifrey forever.
It's really Mick that we see undergoing a transformation when he visits the college from a thug to a misunderstood kid trying to find a better life for himself.
The dialogue could have been more elaborate - that would certainly have upped the quality and believability quotient - not that the film strays too far from reality - in fact it tends to steer back on track and find it's way safely to the end, yet scenes such as the one when Jason Ritter is in the bar by himself with only a few "workers" around him and the things the barman spouts there.
There is also an ongoing attack at "rich people" in general, when the case being considered is that of the spoiled offspring of some rich people - not all "rich people" are worthy of scorn.
The best moment in the film for me is when Jen realizes all her boys have grown up and have a mind of their own.
(o yes I love the guy, he was so humble and awesome guy when I met him at TRL in 2003)
Though the two make acquaintances as teenagers, it isn't until his college years that Charlie finds himself being truly haunted by the ultra-violent hot-head when he shows up unexpectedly in the dorm-room he shares with his childhood friend (Chris Marquette).
I saw it at the Tribeca Film Festival and wondered if and when it was opening anywhere else.
Sylvia Chang, wonderful and enarmoured with supposed Singlish, plays a single mother (Jen) struggling with the uncertainty surrounding the sexual orientation of her third son, Leo (played by a certain delectable newcomer, Tan LePham), when his two elder siblings are both out and proud, much to her dismay, bringing issues of same-sex marriage and their boy-friends back to dinner table discussion.
Those were the days when this program was the best possible Friday night entertainment.
Back in 1988 I believe it was when I was flipping through channels and I came across USA UP ALL NIGHT on the USA Network.
I was watching USA UP ALL NIGHT when I noticed Caroline was no longer on the show.
The cheesy B movies were so hilarious to watch on the weekends that when I did not have plans I would be watching the show.
The other good memory that I had of USA UP ALL NIGHT was they would air like a special USA UP ALL NIGHT when New Year's Eve would fall on a Friday or Saturday night and it was great to watch.
I was seven years old when my parents took me to see "Wings of the Navy" in 1939 at the Vogue Theater in Montebello, CA.
You know the audience is in for a bumpy ride when the all-night bus arrives in a place called Terminal City.
I found the relationship between police and doctor to be unique in cinema, can't remember when I've ever seen it so clearly and dramatically drawn.
In those long ago days when such occurrences were rare, there were no professional police negotiators.
Riding the Big Dog into town (the aptly named Terminal City), he steals the bus driver's gun and, when confronted, plugs him dead.
Films about identical twins are always interesting, especially when they are so gorgeous your two eyes are out on stalks looking both ways at once.
Time after time, the clothes come off, the girls are making out, you see a little fur-burger here, a little whisker-biscuit there(just frontal, no open clam), and just when it looks like the chicks are going to get down to some serious munching, it just cuts to some worthless clip of them cuddling after they had "made love", whatever the hell that is.
This film used to be a classic adult piece and is based on the book, which in itself was judged scandalous when published in 1970 something.
I remember watching Emmanuelle with all my friends when I was 13 years old and at the time it was so hot.
(I know I was under aged when I watched it, so there's no point in pointing that out) But for anyone who's into older movies, Sylvia Kristel or sex, I so suggest you watch Emmanuelle.
Times have changed since then, and I recently viewed the film a couple of times, when I wrote subtitles to it so I could show it to a close friend.
However when Emmanuelle falls in love and runs off with a female friend, her husband doesn't deal with it as well as he thought.
Well the "grown up" part came in the 80's when I was old enough to experience the VHS boom and live on my own.
I was just out of my teens and just experiencing 'the world' when I first saw this original film Emmanuelle.
I NEVER saw or heard of nice women doing ANYTHING like this even though it was 10 years old when I saw it for the first time.
"Emmanuelle" is an elegant, excellently photographed movie, but too often rolls in a syrupy pretensionÂ   It is about a young, French woman who joins her husband in BangkokÂ There much of Emmanuelle's allure is that she isn't shy about her body, or even afraid to engage in sexual activity in semipublic placesÂ   There are a number of rousing, lesbian meetings very typical of French cinema, coupled with encounters with handsome, sensitive men who enjoy superficial lovemakingÂ The film really deals in sensual images and an over-blown, continuous repeating of its erotic philosophyÂ There is sensual intimacy between Emmanuelle and the other women that is rare in the cinemaÂ  My favorite moment when teen-ager Christine Boisson comes upon the nude Sylvia Kristel asleepÂ Without embarrassment, she leans forward and unusually caresses gently and affectionately Emmanuelle's breast with her fingerÂ
This is particularly apparent in the second half of this film when the heroine, after being jilted by one of her lesbian lovers (the oddly named Bee), takes up with the elderly Mario, a man who, despite his grey hair and advancing years, fancies himself both as a lover and as a thinker.
Also, most French films tend to take on unusualy subject manner and are much more direct in approach than US films when it comes to sex and sexuality.
I suppose it doesn't help when you instantly hate the main character, wonder if any of the adults act like adults (much less who isn't sexually overcharged), wonder why none of the teens have any common sense, and it just keeps going.
In an age when sex scenes are deleted from movies by American studios trying for a dumbed-down R rating, it's refreshing to see foreign movies that do their own thing.
The young guy's girlfriend is a real looker, especially in bed, where she looks like women actually look when they're having sex ... naked ... as opposed to American movies where the characters somehow manage to make love fully clothed.
I actually held the faith - right until the final frame, when Garrel falls to the ground beside his mother's coffin and starts masturbating - I held the faith that the point of the past two hours would be revealed.
Even when her films lag -- she shines.
I was thrilled when I was able to secure a DVD copy of Ma Mere (yes, it was legally obtained!)
Being a French film, I do not think it was the intention of the director to create irony by his odd choice of playing "Happy Together" by the Turtles at the film's end when we see the son masturbating next to the dead body of his mother.
On the DVD there is an interview with this seemingly untalented artist in which he says that he used that selection of music because the mother and son could only be happy when they were together, but this makes no sense given the plot and ultimate outcome.
The real problem comes when Rahul falls for Seema (Chawla), a young model who instantly catches the eye of Siddharth.
The story shows, satirically yet substantially, how often we tend to lose ourselves when we try to make our dreams come true.
It's sometimes almost revolting, and yet when you've seen the story-lines that led to these scenes, you may find the actions acceptable (or maybe I've a twisted mind).
HÃ©lÃ¨ne finds it necessary to inform Pierre of her background (her husband raped her when she was very young, causing such anguish that she has become addicted to a life of immorality as a means of escape), a means of warning him of what close association with her could mean.
Even the music scoring is substantive, using Samuel Barber's own setting of his famous 'Adagio for Strings' for the choral 'Agnus Dei', most appropriately heard when Pierre is mentally visiting his spiritual conflicts with his corporal deeds.
The best part is when he's taking the 3 jewish children nearby the swiss border.
The story is realistic, balancing dramatic situations with some funny scenes, like, for example, when Batignole is called in the train station to help a German soldier with a twisted knee.
I did not read the book, I haven't read a Grisham novel since the nineties (when I was in High School)...That being said, I have enjoyed hiss film adaptations in the past--particularly Runaway Jury, The Rainmaker, and A Time to Kill.
In Dunaway and Hackamn's last scene together when Hackman starts crying I almost started laughing.
I have not read the novel this movie is based on, but judging the movie by itself, when the credits rolled, I was thinking: "Uh, so that was it??"
You know when a character is hated when he is supposed to, the actor does no wrong.
Hackman is absolutely first-rate (without being a bravura actor) when he gets the right role, whether it's villainous or heroic, but he's never been good with accents and, man, does this role call for one.
Lastly, and the part of the movie that really irritated me was that they never catch Wedge, even when he does visit Sam in prison.
The chemistry between Adam Hall (Chris O'Donnell) and Nora Stark (Lela Rochon) was played off of more when they WEREN'T together.
The scene when Fay Dunaway's Lee Cayhall Bowen comes to see Sam in the hours before his execution is as good as it gets.
Lee asks if Sam would have killed Joe Lincoln when she was young had she spoken up, Sam tells her yes.
Along the way, Hall learns the unpleasant reality of who he is, the bitter hate and ugliness bred into his grandfather, and insight into the truth of why his father had committed suicide when Hall was a young boy.
But the rest are not so good, such as the stop-motion Screamers that are outdated and when Becker gets shot in half.
Fonda plays a Catholic priest in a small Mexican town at a time when Christians were being persecuted by the Government.
The lieutenat is shaken when he hears the gunshot.
This is set in a time when the Church was designated as an illegal, outlawed organization and was persecuted mercilessly.
It starts when a priest(Henry Fonda) attempting to flee from a Centroamerican country, because Christianity being pursued by a totalitarian govern.
As a fan of the Ford work I've seen there are some times when he's touched perfection (Grapes of Wrath and the Searchers are it for me), and sometimes not so much, which goes without saying he directed many films.
In fact it's for him that some of the picture is most watchable, as he flexes his emotional chops for a scene where it's required for complexity like when he misses the boat and is asked to bless someone dying only to realize there is no wine and must go to ask from a vulgarian for wine (which, as it turns out, is drunken with brandy and all by him).
It's just when Ford over-indulges in the spiritual aspect of the picture, which is only made clearer towards the end, that it loses its footing.
You know you're in for some heavy-handedness when, near the beginning, Henry Fonda's priest (none of the characters are named, as in a fable) opens the doors to an abandoned church and the camera lovingly lingers on his shadow, which forms a crucifix in the dusty doorway.
You know Henry Fonda was a good actor when he can play a priest, and actually look pious.
He must have been talking to the folks at RKO who lost their collective shirts when the public stayed away in droves from The Fugitive.
bout time they made more like they did in the 80s.jason statham is along there with the likes of Dwayne Johnston aka the rock,mark whalberg and vin diesel providing he sticks to what hes good at(killing bad guys and delivering bad lines)"no more lame comedy please vin" reminds me of those good action flicks you used to get when action stars were action stars.not trying to change what they are good at.
As a result, the bloodshed that ensues is pedestrian and ineffectual (and even worse when played for ironic effect); while the outcome of "Death Race" is as predictable as you would expect, the total lack of B-movie charm (and fun) is simply unforgivable.
At one point when a "bad man" character came on screen I had to say:"Look, it's Mr.
It seems like a movie that seems worth watching again, but when you do watch it again, it seems kind of repetitive, kind of like transformers.
I saw this today when going to the movies with my family.
When it said rated R for strange violence and language, I was anticipating really heavy blood and violence like when I saw the new "Rambo," which I didn't expect to be like what it was...  Jason Statham plays Jensen Ames, an ex-NASCAR driver who finds himself framed for murdering his wife in 2012 United States.
I'm not a huge fan when it comes to gore.
It's fun, and it sure is better than being bored when your laptop can't get any internet (which is true, though I'll use their desktop sometimes).
Having wanted to see it since the trailer showed with Wanted, I was excited when I walked into the theater to see it because it looked fun and cool.
When the SWAT team arrive and start forcing people to get out, Jensen comes home to his beautiful wife and baby, and his wife is just making dinner when the baby starts to cry.
Especially when getting your food spat in.
That is made true when he gets into a fight with some tough guys there, and after that spat, he is sent to Hennessey's (Joan Allen, The Bourne Supremacy) office, where he is told that he has one chance to get out: DEATH RACE, a game in which you win 5 races to get out of prison for your own life.
Enter Jensen Ames, a former Nascar driver prior to his prison conviction, who loses his job when the local steel mill is closed.
But there's something a little deeper when it seems like he was put in prison on purpose so he could race.
I always hate it when all those high class critics from the newspapers and journals bash a film for not being what THEY want it to be and not looking at it for what its SUPPOSED to be.
Amongst all the adrenaline filled action, Anderson makes sure to toss in the occasional character development or when he's feeling really daring he'll toss in some pseudo-dramatic realization our hero comes across which helps remind the movie-goer that the movie has a plot rather than just a string of explosive action sequence.
La Face cachÃ©e de la lune is a brilliant Canadian film which has human being's fascination for moon as its backdrop.It is for this purpose that we are taken to 1950s when efforts were being made to send a man to moon.We witness how two major scientific powers America and Russia do all that they can in order to outdo each other.All this is done by them so that somebody is able to establish supremacy in all matters related to travel on moon.
Diana Rigg won an Emmy for her performance as Baroness Lehzen, young Victoria's governess who didn't quite know when to let go.
I didn't know what to expect when I went to see this movie, as the reviews that I've read were mixed.
He is treated rudely by guards when he wants to give a copy of his paper to former Russian cosmonaut Alexi Leonov; is thrown out of a late night bar for being loud and drunk; has an embarrassing meeting with Carl at a sauna, and when he receives an invitation to present his paper at a symposium in Moscow, ridiculously forgets to adjust his watch to local time and faces an empty theater.
Finally given a chance to showcase his creative talent when he is accepted as a participant in a SETI project to collect home videos to send into space, he limits his film to showing his apartment while rambling about his life and his video lacks poetry or self awareness.
He was a dreamer when younger, and unlike many he didn't change when he grew up.
I read a lot of positive press about this Canadian-shot film, first when it was being made (in Vancouver) and soon after its release.
But when saying the director wasn't doing hits off of a crack pipe while working is the best compliment to give a movie, that's still pretty bad.
There's also no sense in ballistics when detectives come around.
Act like it's the greatest thing in the world until the end when one decides he needs a new start.
The big conflict was when they scratched the truck...I just didn't get it.
A great and wise director (whom shall remain nameless) once remarked A movie is dangerous if only for the mood it may evoke, and the choice of when to see a movie is just as important as the movie you choose to see.
My rottweiler, Lyric, who is now 13 years old was in this movie when she was 7 weeks old.
Sam would have been a complete soft touch if the deamon hadn't shown up when he was a baby put it that way lol.
The addition of pictures of Jared and Jensen when they were younger, as a younger Sam and dean were such a brilliant touch lol, loved it.
One of the funniest moments is when Dean questions whether the Dijnn gave a "supernatural acid" to him.
He is always exceptional, and his role here is sympathetic, even when behaving badly, but he does look as if he had just finished crying during a lot of this filmÂ a bad allergy season, perhaps?
:-)  I think the roughest scene is when one guy takes a bite out of another guy and even that is handled pretty lightly.
That's probably good because you really don't want to be wasting time fumbling around with matches when you are single handedly taking out a large group of cattle rustlers.
One must wonder what some of the so called "critics" use as the fundamentals for judging when they view different genres of movies.I mean come on now...it's a MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE...what we want to see is martial arts action...if you want a great plot then go and watch a psychological thriller or a drama.
This movie is a thrill-ride and a splendid movie to watch when you feel like hunkering down on the couch with a bowl of popcorn and an icy cold coke and just relaxing.
It shows that there a people that when overworked, still care about their jobs and the people they deal with on a day to day basis.
I get my VHSs and DVDs from eBay - why pay $10.00 for a one-time shot in the theater, when the same amount lets you watch whenever you want - even if it isn't so often, and only for a change of pace?
Cher is not a person whom you reference when thinking of leading, versatile actresses -- but this isn't so.
It makes you wonder why most directors think of Jazz as a fad when it can be made to work so well in so many settings.
When I spoke to Tom Barbour (Justice Lowell in this film, stage actor and the father of Dudley Moore in the "Arthur" movies) he said when he got the script he was thrilled -- the film opens with him, it took place in his office, he had every other line, and then on page three -- well I guess you will just have to see it.
An attorney takes on the case and begins digging deep into the case when evidence turns up that suggests the culprit may have connections other than with simple street bums.
I remember this show from when I was a college student.
It always rubbed me the wrong way, and I had to endure lynch mob-like opprobrium from my contemporaries when I tried to explain why.
Especially when I said that I hoped Lance would just get it over with and commit suicide already rather than torturing his family (who loved him and accepted his homosexuality) with his constant false alarms and solipsistic behavior.
I videotaped most of the series when it reran on WNET some 20 years ago, and I keep trying to like it.
Only once does an obvious manipulation occur, a dramatic cliffhanger at the end of the 8th episode when Pat Loud has decided to divorce her husband, and son Grant is forced to pick his dad up at the airport, knowing exactly what will transpire when they get home.
Even when the situations and dialog fail to engage (there are plenty of low-key moments amidst the angst), it's fun to watch a filmed time capsule of 1971 where you can see dial telephones, pop-top beer cans, smoking in retail shops, and defunct airlines like Pan Am.
It's easy to look at another family and pass judgment, especially when the unhappiness you see is secretly a reflection of your own unsatisfied life.
The film reaches critical mass when Osama, as a boy, along with Spandi, are taken to a Taliban training camp where it becomes increasingly difficult to keep her sex a secret.
Set in Afghanistan, this is the story of a mother and twelve-year old daughter who become unemployed, and threatened with actual starvation, when their hospital jobs end with the tottering and inadequate institution's financial collapse.
Marina Golbahari is the young girl and she acts the part of a boy with scarcely concealed terror, especially when she is put into the Taliban training camp where, among other things, she must learn Islamic ablutions involving genitals in a room full of boys.
A single woman and her 12-year old daughter (whose name is not revealed) lose their jobs when the Taliban shuts down the hospital they work at in Afghanistan.
and if we don't once aging rally ourselves to do something about these injustices now...then when?
I skipped the movie when it ran at the theaters.
The cinematography captures life in an Afghan village and the excellent performances by the cast seem true to life and The story is set in pre-democracy Afghanistan when the Taliban were cracking down with a force and brutal efficiency that would have shocked Hitler's SS.
In addition they are required to wear a Burka It is a source of constant amazement to me that the same compassionate liberal folks who rightly condemn the third Reich would defend, excuse or rationalize similar atrocities when committed by those in the Middle East.
While it does serve to educate the viewer about the violent impact of religious fundamentalism and the raging inequality of conditions women have faced in Afghanistan, it also teaches the lesson of what happens when an individual defies the established rules of sexuality, a lesson that can be as relevant in Ohio as in Afghanistan.
I guess there wasn't much point in explaining to a viewer like myself who Shariati was but nevertheless, its an evidence of the tiny alterations film go when they are branded for foreign viewing.
In a time when the world is so focused on the conflict unfolding in Iraq, the thing that is most clear to me after watching this movie is the old saying that after thousands of years of wars fought in the name of religion, we are not a second closer to peace than we ever were.
I hardly see why that could be regarded as a weakness when in all its seconds the movie is conveying so much (visual) emotion and from such a close shot.
And secondly, even though the movie mainly focuses on the miserable life of its characters in such surrealistic-to-the-western-eye settings, it does show tiny glimpses of the beauty of life: the lullaby that the grandma sings to put the little girl to sleep, or the joyful, threatening Espandi (the boy with the smoking bucket of wild rue [Epand in Persian or Dari]) who turns into a supporter of the little girl when she's overwhelmed by the aggressive, intrusive boys in the Taliban's Quranic school.
the shot of the sheep hanging from the tree, the scene of the funeral procession on the raft, or the scene of the boats leaving the village (which seemed influenced by the scene when the warships approach in the fantastic "Fellini Satyricon"), these were more photographic than cinematographic, and would have been better appreciated hung on a wall in an art gallery than embedded in a painfully slow-paced film that comes in at a whopping 162 minutes and suffers from terrible dialogue, extremely poor character development, over-acting, uninspired symbolism and heavy stylisation.
They are that which the artist invents when life does not entirely fit or is inadequate to his perception of how it was or should have been.
Even if a flaw, it is a very minor one, for aside from the aforementioned scenes there are numerous other great scenes in this picaresque film that coheres in the Negatively Capable way John Keats claimed great art works; such as when Nikos dances at night as a saxophone plays, or when Eleni, in fever, babbles on and on of the same things.
The very worst part comes right at the end when, over the credits, it reads out what happens to the sad reprobates with each one, without fail, going on to something far better.
As they grow up, their lives take one fateful twist after another, beginning when a teen-aged Eleni gives birth to twin boys.
She becomes a kind of "Everywoman" of the first half of the twentieth century, an era when countries worldwide repeatedly called men to war while women became casualties of the grief, poverty, and physical destruction left behind.
I hope he finished this trilogy, as he will be almost 80 when he does.
The film can skip ahead years in just a second, when the pace usually makes each second feel like years (in a good way!).
The only thing I didn't like, was that the film was too long to fit on a tape and the movie was interrupted when the tape ran out, half way through.
But this film required the massive constructions of a whole city neighborhood of some two hundred, 1920-style stone houses, in the Thessaloniki's harbor section, which will eventually be burnt down, and of a whole village at the edge of Lake Kerkini, some distance north of the city, which will be submerged for the purpose of the plot when the lake rises up naturally about two meters.
The humor completely failed when it was attempted as the affect of the actors was so flat.
There is absolutely NO expressions on their faces when delivering their lines, and the camera roams around the room as if its hunting for a place to rest, further diminishing from what could have been a decent putting forth, had the material been put into the hands of a TALENTED cast and crew.
One funny segment shows the big hurdles that the characters Tom and Charley have to overcome when they try to drive from Manhattan to Long Island--most of us wouldn't have as much trouble, but because of Tom and Charley's privileged background they don't have an easy time of it.
Another reference point, of course, is Woody Allen when Allen was writing and directing genuinely smart New York comedies.
Another familiar face from Stillman's movies is Taylor Nichols, who plays Charlie Black, who when we first see him is stumbling through an explanation of why he believes in God and you do, too, even if you don't know it, and later on offers his own alternative definition of the preppie elite as the Urban Haute Bourgeoisie, i.e.
And gold is an apt visual metaphor, particularly when juxtaposed against the black satin of a tuxedo lapel or the wintry Manhattan night scape, for a world seemingly vanishing right before our eyes--a world too sleek, too soignÃ©, too genteel to survive the steam roller of galloping blue-jeaned egalitarianism.
i wondered when they would get around to putting this one on DVD.
METROPOLITAN has really aged well - I first saw this when it was released, and watching again a few days ago, it really stands up as something unique.
Of course he isn't as smart as he thinks he is, and neither is anyone else in here, and they all know it even when behaving otherwise, which greatly humanizes these otherwise not-exactly-pleasant characters.
Boris Karloff appears as the "Purser"; watch for his big scene on ship, when Wolheim goes into a room with him for some money (what actually happens is a mystery).
Later, when the company goes to the town where Jack was from, he hides because he doesn't want to get caught.
She's even below the juvenile/character man (last billed featured player Franklin Pangborn, who's later lavender camp personality is still not locked in stone here, though his comic and dramatic talents are), but when she manages to get a handsome young drifter (little she knows!)
It captures their girl at the peak of her powers when she could do more with a raised eyebrow than pages of dialogue.
At first Micheal thinks that it was just a hallucination but when he hears about Debbie's death & that of another one of his friends at the sÃ©ance Peter (Mario Ivan Martinez) on the news he becomes convinced that his vision was real.
There isn't even any nudity either, in fact when Micheal & Alexandra have sex it is squeaky clean stuff, Galindo merely shows them kissing each other on the lips while in bed.
One of the cheesiest scenes in slasher history is when Michael goes to Alex's house, becomes mad, and starts shooting!
The scene happens when Alex is in the graveyard...
The tiny message about being careful when working for a classified department is more and more relevant, as Microsoft just discovered when their source code was stolen via the hijacking of an employee's computer on the air from home.
I saw this movie when I was in the "game" that was played in the movie.
He's immediately impressed when Sebastian hears the embedded signal that carries classified data piggy-back with the normal Sputnik beeps.
Her true depth is shone later when she quietly removes herself to care for her baby, without the assistance of its father, Sebastian, who has dropped out of her life.
The director, Josue Mendez, who was present at the Rotterdam Film Festival, explained that there are lots of guys like Santiago in Peru, a whole 'lost generation', forced in joining the military at a young age, and having a hard time dealing with society when they return.
See it, when you have the chance.
The song when they go to the Ping Islands is a really good electronic song by Mark Mothersbough, and the second I heard it I knew I had to download it.
So when I got back from the movie, I downloaded the whole soundtrack.
Part of this is because when I watched the film I didn't know that much about Annie Oakley and another was because I was having too much fun to complain.
However, when a contest is arranged with an unknown local girl (Oakley), she allows him to win but is invited to join Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show as a featured star.
Great license is taken with history, but this film was made when heroes were bigger than life and legend ruled.
With such sentimental authors like Dickens it is difficult to know when you are criticising the director and when the author, and I find it almost impossible to keep them apart in my evaluation of this mini.
This comes out best at the very end when all the loose threads are finally resolved.
Often, when I see an adaptation of a novel, I want to read the novel.
Paul McGann is also wonderful as the Dickensian lawyer Eugene Rayburn, a bored young man whose life is changed forever when he meets Lizzie, the daughter of a man who finds bodies in the Thames, and when he confronts Bradley Headstone, the psychotic schoolmaster who is obsessed with Lizzie.
These people are attractive and young and hip, yet they are proven to be ultimately silly and frivolous when faced with the reality of their actions.
Why is it when (commericial) radio seems to have sunk to new lows in quality and originality, movies seem to be soaring to new heights in choosing good creative music.
**** Little spoiler ahead****  And when Leo went "wild", I was totally confused.
The hippies are driven by a collective fear of getting their tropical paradise discovered, so they use fascistic methods when silencing members of the society to not reveal the secrets of the whereabouts of their beautiful beach/self made tropical paradise "community".
He's not able to feel any empathy or understanding for anyone, the only time he openly questions the fascism of the commune is when his own life is on the line in order to save it.
Richard has dismissed these tales as mere urban legends, but changes his mind when another backpacker, Daffy, gives him a map showing where the mysterious beach can be found.
Sexual tensions arise when Richard finds himself increasingly attracted to Francoise and she deserts her boyfriend Etienne for him.
As far as I'm concerned, I saw the movie at the cinema when it was launched in February 2000 and I thought that it would focus only on DiCaprio, Ledoyen and Canet's efforts to discover this beach.
I didn't want to watch 'The Beach' because of the bad reviews, but when I accidentally came across it while surfing through the channels, I couldn't stop watching.
Too many people draw novel-to-film comparisons, when the two mediums are far too different to be doing so.
Yet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame.
That's when I decided to register here and post a comment - I hope I help someone else to watch the movie because it is worth a watch.
Since when has it been called Friday Night Smackdown instead of Smackdown.
I liked this series when it first aired on TV.
I guess with this commentary I haven't joined the praise of this show and am therefore in the minority, but I felt that I had to disagree with the majority when I feel this way about it.
My wife was taking a class which meant that when our two year old went to sleep she went to work (either school or real) and I had a couple of hours to entertain myself before bed.
I felt like I was being played, pulled in all these directions at once, every resolution a temporary one, no end in sight, knowing that when these 24 hours were up, 24 more were ready to begin.
I remember when season 5 started on FOX on Sunday, January 15, 2006.
He would tell me when he could only watch one more episode and then had to go to bed.
I will not say who or when or how, but there have been several amazing actors on the show, and just when you think they have killed off your favorite, someone new comes in that is just as good.
Because a season on this show covers one day, and every episode is one hour out of that day, you can't get much from it when you start in the middle of a season.
I was hesitant to watch the show, but my friend got me watching it on DVD, and I literally could not wait to toss in the next disk when an episode ended.
You never know what you are going to see and nothing you assume can be for sure, even when a season ends.
Seen it years ago when it came out to rent and again this year on DVD, it is a good film but still in the straight to video bunch of films, some FX are really good for such a film and some are not so hot but it has been done to the best of there budget which has not been much, any weak parts are made up by a good story one i would like to have seen run another 20 mins or more as it seems to end just as its getting in full swing, this is all down to budget mind, if the film had more money, bit more gritty.
I stopped watching it because Tuesday nights became bad for me, but later on in the season I saw the episode when Bauer and Palmer finally met.
It's only recently that I started watching "24" when a German TV station announced a rerun of the first season.
Jamie when interrogated by Nina and Tony), and Jack's wife after calling the CTU about Alan.
Then the incredibly bad acting/direction from the guy who appears to be a normal American business man, who when put under the slightest interrogation suddenly starts speaking in an eastern European accent....What happened to his perfect American accent.....Sorry, I'm not overly keen on Keither Sutherland anyway, maybe that didn't help... but I cannot for the life of me see how anybody thought this was good!
thats about it ....................... zzzzzzzzzzz with the budget they have got you would have thought that they would have spent the money on proper sets instead of a car on a rolling track for example when the shots are inside a car the background is whizzing past at 200 miles an hour !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1) When minor characters are introduced, you wonder when they'll be killed or written out.
In the end you don't really care about any minor role, and when minor characters are filling up a significant proportion of the screen time you have a problem.
3) It seems that too often when Jack Bauer breaks with procedure people go on as normal.
It can appear that when the plot gets too mundane or slow-moving the problem can be solved by throwing in an explosion, collision or death of some kind: that seems to be a de rigueur standard for the show.
But when it hits it can hit hard, being thought-provoking and stimulating like all the best art.
However, a friend lent me the first season box set last week, and I started watching....up to the "13th hour", so I have tried my best to give it a chance, when I actually exclaimed, "enough"!
"Lets party" said the central casting pretty boys, oh how I cringed when Ray?
A clever writer could imply a relay of information between characters (for example, when one characters begins to tell another character about something that we already know, cut to something else).
I find it amusing that anyone was surprised by any outcome of this show when all of the supposed twists and turns wouldn't have been more obvious if they were scrolled, news-ticker style, across the bottom of the screen.
If, when Jack goes to meet his CTU mentor in a darkened, deserted building, the guy got shot right before the was about to give him the key piece of "evidence".
Or how 'bout when the Drazens attack the DOD prison?
At the time when Cousteau's documentaries aired regularly, I was still a child.
The sexual implications in the narrative aren't ignored by Welles, though they are tip-toed around (probably due to the restrictions of 1968), and when Welles as the "old gentleman" finds himself the perfect boy to complete his plan, it's hard not to smirk when he calls the bottle-blonde "a fine looking sailor" and then offers him money.
Who needs Jeanne Moreau when these two are hitting it off so well?
Just a couple of points bother me here: when the sailor tells Moreau (whose character's name is significantly but inappropriately Virginie) that he is 17 and is informed by her that she also is 17, it is quite evident that both, and especially Mlle.
A Jew - Moreau calls him "the wandering Jew" - he has lost his parents in an Eastern European pogrom, and is inured to the blows of fate, and politely imperturbable when upbraided by his imperious master or slapped in the face by an outraged Moreau.
In line with a couple of Welles's other works like Mr. Arkadin and F For Fake, The Immortal Story is about storytelling, or how extraordinary things that happen are sometimes less so when taken into account for what's really underneath them- the person telling it, or being told it, and if it really makes sense or sounds like it isn't b.s.
So, a lot ends up being more fascinating for what is in the subtext this time, even if I still loved looking at Welles's direction, which is always an incredible feat of ingenuity, not to mention here when it's mostly talking heads.
He uses color very well here, too, as it's his first time using shades of brown and gray for the Macao town parts, little flourishes of color that become darkened when around Clay, and the characters of Virginie (Moreau) and the Sailor (Norman Eshley) who compared to Clay are vibrant in appearance.
With still some of those same melancholy beats she had when she appeared in French New Wave pictures, she taps into Virgine as someone who's more complex (albeit in small part my plot convenience, oddly enough) than someone like Clay would've thought in his factual-type realm.
Only when looking at him under the surface did things seem a little intriguing, but on the surface ineffectual.
It deals with a subject that I could think and rouse about for hours, about what it is to live a life where things aren't predictable, or when things are mandated and put in rigid structure what it means to want to find why a story isn't made true or not.
Yet when these 'natural born killers' create these anomalies of the human being, through media their faults can be praised and cheered, as the decreasing presence of morals, values and individuality of western society become history.
I have no problem with people disliking to film but i dislike it when people comment on the film as just being mindless violence and not giving the film it's chance to show it's potential.
The colour palette Stone uses is also incredible (especially the green tone for certain emotional charged scenes, because green represents something in the movie ... when you watch it you will figure it out), but he was also experimenting a lot with this film.
Natural Born Killers is a very violent and controversial film.The two Columbine school shooters were said to have have watched this film over and over again.Its a very violent film and not recommended for children who cannot handle this type of material.I am 15 now and I saw this film when I was 13.It didn't affect me in any way.I play plenty of violent video games and watch violent movies and they don't make me want to kill anybody.This is because I can separate fantasy from reality.Anyway that was my rant...now on to the film review.Natural Born Killers is an underrated and excellent movie.Im surprised its only 6.8, I think it should be in IMDb's Top 250.The performances in this film are great.Woody Harleson the actor who played Mickey Knox ironically had a father who was a hit-man.Anyway the story is great as it shows how the media portrays murderers.The film basically shows the life of Mickey and Malloryy knox.In a comedic "I Love Lucy" spoof, you see Mallory's life at home with her abusive father.Mickey is a butcher who delivers meat and delivers it one day to Mallory's home.The two both led disturbing lives and basically they kill Mallory's family and start going on killing spree's.After a while, they get caught and go to prison while a reporter wants to do an interview with Mickey.A prison riot breaks out and basically they are set free.A cool aspect about this film is sometimes during the violent scenes of the film, you see some trippy images.Natural Born Killers is a great film worth watching for anyone who can handle it.
I think the dialog when they actually stopped to do it very nicely written and well executed.
But as Mickey (Woody Harrelson playing a serial killer on the run) says towards the end of the movie when he is getting ready to shoot Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr. as a manic journalist) 'Killing you and what you represent is a kind of statement--I'm not 100% sure what it is'.
I thought when I first saw it that it would be perhaps a satire of the media and how it shows violence but it's not.
NATURAL BORN KILLERS (1994)  Cinema Cut: R   Director's Cut: NC-17  It's an unusual Oliver Stone picture, but when I read he was on drugs during the filming, I needed no further explanation.
The cinematography is superb; different colours, shadows, styles create a feeling of disorientation; the green colour most evident of all is green, to resemble the sickness of the killers (in the drugstore when they are looking for rattlesnake antidote).
it is the same intensity that she brings to every role that makes her a star, and an annoyance when in the wrong mindset.
I remember when Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers was released in 1994 and delivered a well-deserved kick up the arse to American audiences.
Indeed, they were so outraged that, when teen-fans left their Oklahoma home to go out east and shoot fellow Americans, parents blamed Natural Born Killers for having inspired the shootings.
Now, I don't want to knock Entertainment Weekly as they report on reality, but when a film like NBK gets a high ranking as 8, they should be called Entertainment, Weakly.
Now thirdly, it is my guess that the film struck a little too close to home when it opened and therefore attracted unfair criticism.
In prison, when Mickey is being interviewed on national TV, the film cuts to a simple black and white image of a typical American home.
I remember "Natural Born Killers" making a huge fuss when it was released because the media and conservative families were in an outrage over the level of "glorified violence" in the film.
Critics over the years have panned this film as a 'glorification of meaningless violence', when in fact the film itself is basically the 90's equivalent to Kubrick's 'Dr.
The writers grew up in the 50's and 60's when the paranoia of Cold War was still in their faces everywhere they went.
Because the same people who hate this film are the same people who the film-makers were laughing at when they made it.
Secrets abound, however, when footsteps and a child's laughter are heard within.
This is only compounded when Pete (ME: George Litman!
2) FOLKLORE - A group of college friends set out for the woods when the driver Travis (Nar Williams) runs over a strange wolf-like animal.
After watching three-quarters of the movie and shutting if off in disgust, I was incredulous when I came here and read all the wonderful reviews of this film.
I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this film.
Geographical errors: Like for example on the segment Honey-Getter when the two guys Edward and Preshant get off the train, right before the lady Humera starts chasing them.
If you notice the conductor says R train to Brooklyn when in fact it's the S train which is the shuttle that transports you back and forth between Grand Central Station and Times Square.
Example#2 Right after the part I just described in Example #1 when the train takes off, it keeps proceeding forward.
Murrray's deadpan can be funny but only when he's juxtaposed with either an outrageous situation (Ground Hog Day) or with outrageous people (Ghostbusters).
You half expect when you see the both of them together that it's going to be a comedy, but you leave the segment disappointed that you didn't get what you expected.
She was 49 when this was released in 1997, but you can't really tell.
I love short story films, especially when, of one particular theme, they are connected to satisfy a feature length running time.
(I wouldn't be surprise to learn that they had a lot a sex together when the cameras where not shooting...).
The characters all fall flat -- there are minutes upon minutes before any humor is attempted, and when it is, it always falls flat.
My girlfriend said she'd never seen a porno film, so she dragged me into the cinema to see "Stille Dage i Clichy" in Copenhagen, when the film was new.
In the mid-seventies a relative gave me a big stack of old Evergreen Review magazines, and I started an interest in more counter-culture things from the '60s because of that, since I was just a child when much of it took place.
Very similar to Spike Lee when making Malcolm X: black people all over loved it and many white people did not, why it failed to win the Oscar.
Never have I been moved as much as when I watch this film.
Especially when all that is portrayed... is the abuse.
In a time when Black children are taught by a euro-centric curriculum only enough to despise their history, and themselves, and groomed to be only guard dog or guarded, this film is an essential thing.
Another thing, how did the male lead's dad have a mansion and then when they got outside it was a ghetto apartment parking lot.
In an episode when they were singing at a party, the mother of the group was singing... but the problem with that was, it was a male's voice used in the over-dub.
Reynaldo Rey is always funny, especially when he gets angry...Remember House Party 3?
The asides of the men-like when one of them mentions Enchanting April Showers starring Traci Lords-also provides some hilarity.
So it's 7am and I'm barely awake on a Monday morning and just flipping through the channels, minding my own business, when along comes this short that put me in the best frame of mind for the week.
When the sign "the end" comes, you think that something is missing, it's not possible an ending like that, maybe the deadline are the only explanation for such a sudden end, when you're still waiting for something that justify the movie.
In particular, this second part contains an easily-unnoticed topic of how much insult the male pride can take, and whether or not it is worth being guarded when love is at stake.
Pablo Berger, the director of "Torremolinos 73", takes us back to the Spain of the seventies when Franco was still around and where he sets the scene for this satire about the clandestine porno industry.
Do you remember (especially you boys)when you were small?
When you guys had your "gang" with leader (Steve), when you got a new boy (Ned) to your gang and some guy was very jealous on him?
And when you jump over small pond (sorry huge swamp) there were plenty of leeches on you?
Oh, I love that movie, now I know why I felt so sentimental when I watched that movie first time - it reminds me my childhood so so much.
We didn't have scientific dreams :-)   I am sure that in this movie Wes Anderson tries to picture his adventurous dreams when he was small.
Most other games I used to play then seem weak and childish (well, duh) when looked at now.
The beautiful and articulate lawyer, Inez Milholland, played by Julia Ormond, delivers one of the most memorable scenes in the movie when she grandly leads the 1913 parade riding a regal white horse, holding herself with pride and dignity, wearing a resplendent white robe and magnificent angel wings suitably used to symbolize justice and liberty.
As it is, by using a modern filming style and adding in lots of jokes that no one would ever think women of that time period would use (though I'm sure they DID say some pretty crazy things when men were out of hearing range), the writers and director managed to make a forgotten part of history rather hip.
In this day and age, when communicating to young people just how important voting is, it's important that media like Iron Jawed Angels is made available.
Discrimination and patronizing plagued their efforts, and all shows that not all women suffrage groups were on the same side when it came to voting.
I knew when I saw the woman's naked back scrawled with Votes For Women in what appeared to be red lipstick that this would be yet another stinker from HBO.
Wilson, a respected president in the annals of history, comes off as a stubborn man who resents the ladies' picket lines and allows them to be imprisoned, even when he knows they have not broken any laws.
I immediately checked out when the next showing was so I could see the whole thing.
I will be honest, when I first saw the previews to this film I was worried that Anderson may have gone the way of so many other directors who have developed their name in Hollywood.
One of my favorite lines and scenes in this film that I have raved to everyone as the epitome of an Anderson film was when Zissou first takes Ned to the island and Eleanor tells Steve that one of his cats died.
My fear of the CGI was muted immediately when I saw that Anderson used the technique to create some of the most imaginative creatures ever to lurk in the sea impressed me.
I was just amazed when I finished watching this Italian thriller.
And that is what sets this apart from most other games, and is it's most memorable quality: when the Dreamcast, which I had this game on, "died" and my console fell into disrepair, I found something I have found with only one other game since: I began to mourn for the loss of the game, and began to miss it terribly.
Plus, a glitch about the game, is that she flies in cut scenes, yet she can only glide when you play as her.
The premise itself was great, but when you watch the film, you almost forget that the sole purpose of the film is to confront the jaguar shark, as you become connected with the characters emotionally.
As the Sonic Series has easily been my favourite series of games, I was delighted when Sonic adventure was announced, promising a 3-D interpretation of Sonics 16-bit exploits as well as progressing the series gameplay and direction.
Everyone seems to LOVE this BOMB movie!I was going to school in NYC when the movie opened.
Johnson, who resembles a young Joan Jett, comes on like a little punk rocker-in-the-making, so its surprising (and rather disconcerting) when her moment in the spotlight finally arrives and she's transformed into a New Wave caricature (or, perhaps, a "Rocky Horror" patron).
I saw the movie when it came out and was just floored.
It came out at a time when I was going through my own rebellion against society and it's norms.
I've got the album way back when and still listen to it.
The climatic Sleeze Sister concert and the inevitable parting of Nikki and Pammy is true for all first loves when people realize that they have to let go of someone because they are growing apart.
I received a DVD copy of Times Square for review and didn't expect much since I was not much of a fan of the whole punk rock scene when it came about.
I didn't get to see the movie again until my mother got for me for Christmas of 1990 on video back when it was put out by Thorne-EMI HBO Video and I was lucky enough to find the soundtrack at a second hand record store on the old RSO label.
I saw this film years ago, when it first came out at the cinema.
The low budget was especially visible when a MicrosoftÂ® Natual Keyboard is seen in the film, obviously a high-tech computer would need one.
"You Can't Hurry Love" accompanies their escape from the hospital, and when Johnny (Tim Curry) the disc jockey learns that "you two sweethearts have a favorite song" he plays it for them.
Maybe I was too young and dreamy when I watched this movie, but my friends and I could not stop talking about this through high school years.
The movie magazines I used to read said that Robin Johson was found out by a talent agency when she was going to Brookly Vocational School or something, but it could be wrong like many other stories like how Natalie Portman was spotted at a Pizza place on Long Island....
Try and think back to the times when you had that hint of rebellion in you...and if you can get a copy of this film, do so!
Nikki peeks at Pammy's diary one day, when Pammy's asleep.
Even when they have a serious rift in their relationship, due to the meddling all-night DJ.
Especially when an 19 inch TV dropped from a high rise building was about to land on top of them!
This all started when the two troubled girls met in the New York Neurological Hospital and realized that it was not them but the adults who put them there should have been committed.
It was late in the film when both Nicky and Pamala went on their own, with the behind the scenes help of Johnny LaGuadia, as the popular "Sleaze Sisters" to express their feelings about life hope and the future of America's youth as well as their relationship with each other.
(Then again, many didn't realize the gay-themes that were so blatant in "A Nightmare On Elm Street 2" when it was first released five years later.)
I saw this film when I was 12 and it changed my life.
But it's there and available for the viewer to ask -- what happens when something real and vital becomes just another fashion statement?
Likewise the script changes needed when Alvarado refused to dance topless saved Moyle from looking like an exploiter.
I can not begin to tell you what a horrible movie "Little Witches" is... but I also cannot tell you what a huge "crush" (I am censoring myself there) I had when watching Sheeri Rappaport.
Group of unexcited Catholic school girls, forced to board in for Easter Break decide it would be tons of fun to play with fire when they re-enact ancient voodoo/witchcraft curses.
;=8) Faith(Mimi Reichmeister) is the sweet, smart, virginal, heroic snugglebunny who just wants to do the right thing; naturally, she saves the day when the Giant Evil Scaly 3-Mouthed Demon Thing comes for munchies.
Now we could assume that either Miss Young's character is schizophrenic or suffered a massive brain injury, but when her aunt agrees with her and they work hard to get Power (even after he's robbed them), this strains common sense way beyond the breaking point.
And on top of this, Ms. Young yells and bellows and over-emotes like mad when she argues with her father about this.
It's great when the school girls stumble across the old satanic temple and find the book on black magic spells and then they start to form a coven and try to summon up a demon and then one of their friends tries to stop them before they offer a human sacrifice, it's just really good.
This is revealed in a certain scene when The Good Guy can't summon the strength to the get out from under the naked Bad Girl until his girlfriend (the Good Girl) walks into the room.
That was my reaction when I first watched the gorgeous Sheeri Rappaport in this B-Witch movie.
ALso, the movie has some cheesy moments like when the devil monster "surprises" the naked chicks.
one is that you'll notice the TV in his house flickers when his mind is not straight, and an obvious one is that the fish are his subconscious.I also think that the film is supposed to show how people crippled by there niceness and quietness stay at the bottom of the ladder in a corporate business and the people with legs to step on others, reach the top, and don't have to care about the lower people.
In an era when class and style are neither appreciated, celebrated or understood, a film like this is a reminder of these words mean -- or at least meant.
An office drone that is ready to administer his "justice" to all those who refuse to accept him, when an unexpected twist occurs that leads him down a different path.
I like it when I'm not distracted by a popular song in a film and "He was a Quiet Man" doesn't suffer from uniqueness.
So yes you can say I was very presently surprised, I remember first hearing about this film and the quality reviews it had been getting and I was a bit reluctant when hearing just who was included in the cast.
Correspondingly, his female interest discovers that it is only when she is forced to depend on someone else that her life truly begins.
Well, just when Bob finally gets the courage to do the deed, he is beaten to the punch by a fellow enraged office worker.
His neighbors finally acknowledge him; when one of them asks when did he move in, Bob replies, "I've lived here five years."
When he relents, that's when the two begin a tentative relationship that begins to calm the deadly monster lurking within him.
It seems that when you finally have a grasp on where it's all headed, the picture does a 360 and winds up going right back to where it started, both metaphorically and literally.
Anyway, when she's confined to a wheelchair for the rest of her life, for me, it's almost like stepping back to truly appreciate a fine piece of art.
Young is great when she's sinning a little; A few years down the road, she'd be a lot more difficult to watch.
We are left to ponder several things, yet when the preceding ninety minutes are so intentionally devoid of poignance, the film may simply leave your mind as the final frame does.
"I didn't know what it was like for a man to make his living with his gun," Tally tells Caleb when they meet again, "walking the streets a living target.
And Lewis really shines when it comes to building the suspense leading up to the inevitable bar room showdown between the bad guy and the good.
I give this movie a 10 because it touches so deeply on the most important life issues: how we think, make decisions, and how narrow minded we are when taking care of our daily problems.
Lynch always leaves his films open to interpretation, and he is especially reluctant to explain his stories Â the above "a woman in trouble" was his most forthcoming explanation of this film when pushed.
This is one of Power's very early films; he was only 22 when it was made, and though only a year older than he was, Young had been around since silent film days.
Its most obvious points of comparison are Lynch's own Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive, but even they seem like child's play when compared to EMPIRE, which offers tantalising clues to unlocking its mysteries, with the audience forever ten strides behind.
Why allude to it in here, especially when people can't refer to the series?
Young is as assured as Katharine Hepburn was in "Holiday," although you get the feeling, when she's throwing fits and tossing heavy objects at her millionaire father (Charles Winninger), the people in charge wanted to invest her performance with a little of the spirit of Carole Lombard.
This begins to be a problem when the real guy who played the character in the film confronts his persona and demands that he return to the movie and everyone resume their "real" lives where movie character are fictional and people are real.
Cinema is just an illusion, you can't actually "play it real when it gets real" because IT (cinema) never gets real.
Their actions have no consequences, a movie character can die today because the director films the last shot of the movie and he/she can happily make love the other day when another shot is filmed.
The film "technically" has no US distributor, though it has many European ones and the French Studio Canal signed on early at the stage when DL said he was using DV and didn't know what he was doing.
The visuals are to be enjoyed on their own terms especially when they seem not to fit with the rest of the film.
When the shot is static the amount of detail in the picture can be incredible but when its hand held and moving around its grainy and looks pretty terrible.
My advice is to see this film and when you do, just sit back and have some fun.
This film is set in the early days of television when all shows were filmed live before an audience.
The King Kayser character has echoes of Sid Caesar when you hear him.
This movie is one to watch if you want something to watch on a night when there's nothing else on.
One of my favorite lines was made all the more hysterical by O'Toole throwing it away - when he's questioned about going to the Stork Club, he says, "Why not?
Well of course everyones thrilled but there's just one small problem....Alan is a notorious hell-raiser who has a reputation of being drunk when he's not working.So Benjy is set the task of staying with Swann to make sure he shows up for the show sober.
I was twelve years old when my parents took me and my brother to see this terrific film in a nearly empty movie theater on Long Island.
Four ghetto friends get into trouble when one kills a store owner.
One of high point of the movie is when Baker takes O'toole have dinner in his mother's apartment in Brooklyn.
Needless to say every Saturday I was glued to the TV watching "Your Show of Shows" Even though I was at an age when I should have been out chasing around.
So when I see a truly outstanding movie based on these people, I am doubly touched.
The supporting cast of this movie is almost flawless (Mark Lynn-Baker is a little too frantic in some of the more slapstick moments, but VERY good when simply being sarcastically funny or very sincere).
But the movie belongs to Peter O'Toole, and, as in The Stunt Man (made a few years earlier), when he's on screen you can barely take your eyes off him.
Bologna is as mercurial and difficult as Caesar supposedly was, and when upset at some comments made by Brook's film version "Benjy Stone" (Marc Lynn-Baker), he appoints Stone to keep an eye on the notoriously tipsy and unreliable Swann to make sure he shows up for the show's rehearsals and final production.
Peter O'Toole gives his best comic performance in this movie, abetted by Linn-Baker, Bologna, Selma Diamond (whose face glows when O'Toole shows her what he has to make a woman happy), Kazan, Bill Macy and the rest of the film.
This laugh-filled comic romp follows the adventures of Benji (Mark Linn-Baker), a gopher for COMEDY CALVACADE (this film's version of YOUR SHOW OF SHOWS), who is excited when a swashbuckling actor of the period named Alan Swann (Peter O'Toole) has been booked as a guest on the show turns out to be a skirt-chasing alcoholic who Benji is put in charge of keeping under control until showtime.
I've watched it when i was a child and now as a young adult again.
they only just recently opened a new one across from the Public toilets, the old bank   they only got Bendigo bank now , the Pub that they used has now Been Reopened was closed for a while, they only had one pub for awile down near Primary school end great people there nice lunches the emppty Bakery still there, the supermarkets still there, the chemists still there, most hasn't changed they still use the football Ground minyip-Murtoa alternate games between Minyip & Murtoa got a lot of friends both places   i remember going into the Milk Bar where i met Viki Blanch she was nice some talk to you for a while especially when their between shots
I liked the show less at the end when all the focus turned on 'what was happening in Coopers Crossing' in stead of the 'accident of the week'.
As wild as he is when performing in this movie, he was much wilder on stage when he did his shows with Clayton and Jackson and later with Sonny Knight.
There is also a great supporting cast of young actors including Samuel L. Jackson when he was still known as Sam Jackson.
The last resident was Jimmy Conklin and his vaudeville act The Great Rupert, a gifted squirrel who returns to the apartment when Conklin releases him, takes up a position behind the baseboard and drops the money into Durante's apartment as fast as Orth deposits it.
Love interest is provided by Durante's daughter, Terri Moore and Orth's son, Tom Drake and the only jarring note is Moore's unexplained volte-face when she ditches the sugar-daddy she's been dating in favor of Drake's penniless songwriter.
I had to laugh out loud when they said the animation was so "realistic."
My best friend was my Border Collie, given to me when I was three.
When I was thirteen I had to learn to live in a city when my Dad got himself a better job.
Now, six years later, I still cry when I watch this film.
This cartoon tells about a little documentary made by a talking dog saying about his new pathetic life with a bald dumb called Larry.After buying him, Larry goes to a department store in downtown to buy some new furniture.But the old guy makes many stupidities like putting a nuclear globe in a common lamp and then destroying part of the store, or when he puts his dog in a little SPA bed but Larry adjust to a killing(And not relaxing) speed.
It would seem that Seth McFarland's main characters are mostly moronic even when compared to Homer Simpson (cf.
I think it was better when courage didn't speak.
When there car cut in half, when he was about to hit the mound of TNT, yes very "kid" slapstick, he turns around and says " isn't this a bit contrite."
like when the Peter predecessor asked the Brian Predecessor, if he was OK after thrown into the wall, he brought tragedy which i do not know how to spell or even get a hold of how to spell it.
Plus when the Deputy kills the Mayor saving Venessa's life, he's arrested.
My colleagues at work often question my taste in film: they cannot understand why I waste my time championing low budget horror when I could be watching the latest blockbuster to wow the masses at the local multiplex.
You might experience various emotions watching this movie but one thing for sure, you won't feel like you've wasted your time when it's over.
Consider yourself as unprepared for what you will see but be ready to be surprised when you do and mentally exhausted once you did.
The FBI refuses because they want Romeo.... Nihaal Singh refuses because........... the FBI refuses because............... Nihaal Singh refuses because................. the FBI refuses because.................  What happens when this Catch 22 situation arises?
What happens when a Cute and Adorable villager from Punjab unleashes his "PUNJABI PUNCH" on the streets of New York ?
the villain is played by kamaal khan by the name of romeo who is an international hit-man who kills a priest after doing an act of terrorism(i thought the character was supposed to be smart).romeo comes to apna Punjab on a mission and when nihaal singh tries to arrest him(for not having a revolver license) he fools him and escapes crossing the border effortlessly(wow!!
But the best has gotta be when Q(Epps) fights Bishop on the rooftop.
Where Q, after failing to save Bishop from falling to his death is told, he's got all the juice now, he just shakes his head and it shows a flashback from when Bishop was his friend, we wanna know if Q and Steel get away with robbing the liquor store!
Usually when you watch an atrocious film, comedy is there because the film is so bad.
I thought previously I had seen the worst comedy of all time when I endured Going Overboard.
You know a movie is in trouble when the best acting comes courtesy of Brigitte Neilson and Corey Haim.
saw the movie 25 years ago and still can find its traces in my memory - amongst these the strongest when Robert and a hitchhiker drive along a forest of power line pylons and find them awful.
Robert says something like "years from now when only a few of them are left we might say they're beautiful" (sorry, a 25 year old memory is not the best base for correct quoting) Christopher Petits influences of the early Wim Wenders road movies can be traced down best in " I'm Laufe der Zeit (Kings of the Road) " from 1976 - its in b/ w as well.
The main actor does a wonderfully minimal job, as is best with this sort of project; a face that moves only a certain amount, and when needed; above all, a face that reveals itself as the blank canvas mask that we alone can choose or otherwise to feel the emotions through.
i remember seeing this when i was 7 years old.
i gave it a 10 out of 10 because of how good it was for when it was done.
But when those funny bits appear they are pretty much top-drawer, i.e.
I challenge anyone not to laugh when the hair metal band pitches up in the woods.
Now here we see the other end of the extreme when it comes to movies with or without charisma.
I remember playing Treasure of the Rudras when I was 15 years old.
I love 2Pac as rapper and this was his first movie I've seen and I have to say that the film did fulfill exactly what I thought it would be, when talking about it's quality.
Hitch said this was his second mistake of his career when he falsely led the audience into thinking the flashback scene was real.
Jane Wyman's character has a thirst for wanting to know the truth, but she doesn't when she finds it.
I thought that it could have had a more intense climax when his guilt was revealed.
Doris Tinsdale is the name Eve Gill used when she started working for Charlotte Innwood (Marlene Dietrich).
But one of the major plots twists in the film was when Smith tells Gill that Jonathan was acquitted for an earlier murder when he claimed that he killed in self-defense.
The attractive Jane Wyman as Eve is outstanding in the lead role, whilst Marlene Dietrich steals much of the limelight, notably when she performs the song 'The Laziest Girl in Town' surrounded by smartly dressed men.
Charlotte suffers from 'Stage Fright' in front of an audience when she is presented with the doll, and is a fascinating character who uses her acting skills to get herself out of tricky situations in real life.
Eve turns the tables on Charlotte by posing as her dresser and when she reveals her true identity a horrified Charlotte tells her, "I'll give you anything if you keep me out of this."
The only thing i caught in this movie that was really wrong was at the end when Q is holding bishop trying to prevent him from falling...If you look very closely you'll see bishops arms is white..lol.
As the anecdote was explicitly treated as Cooper's own version of events, I see little "dishonesty" in Hitchcock's clever manipulation of the audience, and the final twist certainly succeeded in taking me by surprise Â though I probably should have noticed something amiss when the romance between Eve and Smith began to develop.
Two other characteristics of this movie are its brilliant camera work (especially at the start, when Todd goes into the house where the dead body is), and its well-written dialogue.
Though Wyman is a bit too obviously American, she makes for an appealing heroine; it's especially fun when she has to switch between playing Eve and posing as the Cockney maid, Doris.
There's a fascinating mash-up of talents at work when Charlotte sings "The Laziest Gal in Town": song by Cole Porter, husky vocals by Dietrich, costumes by Christian Dior, direction by Hitchcock.
So why, one wonders, does Hitchcock settle for a cheap double-exposure shot of Dietrich in closeup in the foreground while Richard Todd is at the window in the background, when Gregg Toland had already achieved such "deep focus" shots without "trick photography" nine years earlier in "Citizen Kane?"
The infamous "lying flashback" at the beginning seems far less troublesome to today's audiences than it did when the film was released, perhaps because we're more accustomed to films playing tricks with time, now.
But then, when you've delivered a shot as spectacular as that long dolly of Richard Todd from exterior to interior and up the stairs, you can do anything you darn well please.
Eve has already conveniently fallen into the arms of Smith, so there's no sting when she learns of Jonathon's deceit.
Micheal Wilding, playing the detective who is falling for Wyman, is also great, especially when he finds that she is betraying him and may have only been using him.
The scene at the garden party when she switches from Dietrich's cockney maid to Smith's innocent date with every turn is delightful.
I mean seriously, just how real are we supposed to take this movie when in one scene (set in a diner, if I recall correctly), the boom mic dips into the picture frame, not once, but twice!
This was the point when Tommy and I were laughing at it so hard, we shut the movie off, and immediately drove back to the video store to see about getting a refund.
The film goes on too long and I didn't like the sanctimonious message in the end especially when the director's commentary on the DVD confirmed that he was trying to show the futility of violence.
I remember seing this movie as a teenager when it was new.
In this way, it avoided Hollywoodism, but when I consider how the film-makers could have incorporated vast vistas as a cinematic expression of the isolation of these communities I was dismayed.
My first reaction when I finished watching this movie for the first time was, "Woah, Irish ninjas versus vikings?
I remember seing this movie as a teenager when it was new.
the show has a good balance between the dark moments and lights up when it's getting to tough.
I actually cried at the end of volume 4 when Hisoka begged Tsuzuki to live for him.
When such a large group of people thinks this film is a masterpiece, it must be the end of time, when pure trash is taken for great art.
Soon enough, trouble erupts when they rob the local liquor store in search of "juice" (power, respect) and a war erupts between Q and Bishop.
But my favorite scene is the one at this Elvis' stunt show place when Ricco shouts "Da geht einiges!".
I can never forget how I felt when I first saw Tupac as an actor; it completely blew me away.
So that if you're really down, there would still be the music...and when you're the happiest in your life the record would skip and the moment would never end..." After their last night, when Floyd looks up into the Hamburg sky one last time, the soundtrack to the film DOES skip and captures that perfect moment, the essence of parting, that loss that really isn't and that unbearable inevitability that tomorrow your best friends will be far away.
It's beautiful to care about the shape of a picture, it's even great when we make it well and the greatest stuff it's when we've got a rather solid story... now it's not the case here, the shape is soooo bad, traveling used like amateur, pretty bad effects (see it to believe), overbids of camera movements, thanks to the director for the bad use of the provided means.
When you try to make a Fincher's like, well you put all your guts in it, or do it Ã  la classical way, we even have difficulty in being moved by the loud failure at the box office, at least the producers will think twice before giving money to Berry, especially when he tries to put on life a story so stupid.
We shall note Garcia's fine interpretation, a baaad from Cotillard (as usual, bah, when we aren't an actress it's more difficult) and poor Lecoq who, no chance buddy, had to play an improbable and ridiculous character.
I should now express my gratitude to the woman who stood guard at the box-office on that long ago Saturday night when I, a mere lad eager to see "Bullitt," was refused entry to the second-run movie house where "Petulia" was the supporting feature on the grounds that one of these films (I know not which) was considered too adult for an 11 or 12 year old who looked even younger.
It's like a car commercial that uses sexy images to equate the product with youth, beauty, and affluence when, for most people, the vehicle will provide nothing more than a means to get to the grocery store faster than they could on foot.
I think he even gets mad once when Christie calls him "pretty".
This is told in a most innovative way for its time, which makes it more regrettable that the film was handled as a pop extravaganza, when it was an innovative and puzzling product with a structure that demanded a more intellectual participation from the audience; and with an organic use of the flash-forward technique (proposed by its editor, Antony Gibbs), an anticipation device that would become common practice in later years (it is interesting to note that five years later the cinematographer of "Petulia", Nicolas Roeg, would direct Julie Christie in the horror drama "Don't Look Now", which contains a scene film editors often mention as an outstanding example of the flash-forward technique, a sex scene inter-cut with takes of the following scene, edited by Graeme Clifford).
Certainly when I first saw this upon release, having seen Lester's early b/w films, I was expecting another slightly arty avant-garde outing.
Magnificently and correctly, of its time, this time capsule of a movie, captures exceedingly well that perturbing flip from 'swinging sixties' to murder and mayhem, and how true the moment when the 'in love' George C Scott skips across a room while the TV plays back images from the ongoing war in Vietnam.
Julie Christie continues to work when she wants to and picks her projects well.
I saw this film when it opened and recently bought the video and watched it again.
At least not when Colin Nutley's at the helm.
This movie makes you laugh when Chris (Will Smith) is having one of his worse days ever, chasing a gypsy in the middle of the road, getting hit by a car, running after a crazy guy, running from a cabbie without paying him and finally, finally when he has the greatest day of his life it makes you cry.
Dude, that's when you get ANY job that pays the bills and put the sales work aside.
But I suppose that's the point, and Chris says it somewhere in the first act: that when the founders of the Constitution wrote "the pursuit of happiness" into the text, they only promised the pursuit.
The chase is a long, mean one; but when the end is found, it flings us higher than any feel-good film in a while.
I ask myself when the last occasion might have been that any of these critics genuinely had to :spoiler: run, under painful, embarrassing duress, from a cab - because they didn't have the money; or when the forces of life seemed to conspire against them so unfairly that they broke down in tears.
Spoiler: when your wealthy boss, who you CANNOT disappoint, asks you to borrow the last five dollars in your wallet, and you know that that money is all you have in the world - to feed your family, to pay your gas.
You go through times in life when you feel that things couldn't possibly get worse - and then they do - and then they do again.
Chris Gardner (not the real one perhaps, but the one in this movie) is my personal hero; my shining example; my inspiration - the guy that never allows himself to sink - even when he can feel his shoelaces trailing on the seabed.
I'm still working on getting the job that earns me enough to have a less painful life - when Chris finally achieves it, I want it for him so badly that I feel it in the very fibre of my being.
It comes at a time when I need it most.
I'm also a Tupac fan and I can honestly say when I first saw this movie..
The story line was great and to think that the film was based on a true story it made me think about how lucky I was sitting watching a film on a 80 inch screen spending over Â£30 when this guys entire money was Â£20.
I plan on seeing the film again when it releases to the general public, and am very interested to see what changes were made after running it through the test screenings.
For example, when Chris appears to stiff a taxi driver for fare (it was really the rich white guy who failed to pay), the taxi driver never uses the "n" word.
Jefferson, when he penned the Declaration of Independence, did not promise Americans happiness, but only the right to pursue it.
Hidden is a classic example of what happens when someone makes a short film idea last for 90mins.
With the odd piece of dialogue here and there we mostly get footage of people playing hide and seek, most of which is people running, people over reacting to being found you know the classic things that happen when there is no clear or actual narrative.
and when it arrives, smash it with a hammer.
Crawling through wet "cutty grass" with mud smeared all up your pants, trying to keep out of sight and wishing you'd worn a darker jumper, itching from a dozen mozzie bites and hoping you don't sit on a tree wetaÂ This is the stuff that Kiwi childhoods are made of, and when you see an unlucky movie character slide down a wet bank and land in the creek you know exactly how he feels.
There are approximately a dozen main characters to get to know, which isn't easy when all they're doing is chasing each other through the undergrowth and climbing up trees.
What happened to Imogen when she was a little girl?
I won't say any more, but you'll know what I mean when you watch it.
Some even gave me the creeps, the guy with the sore lip especially confused me, when I saw him do the whole act around the tree part I was thinking "oh no, he's going to end up an alien, just like that movie where the woman loses her son and everything's a mystery and suddenly there's people jumping through ceilings."
I loved this movie, the odd feeling of confusion it gave me at the end, that almost uncomfortable sensation, it's wonderful when a film makes you feel so much.
It's the sort of fable that cheers one up when the blues draw in and then turn into a blackly dark cloud, yes it be true, old craggy faced Paul Hogan has the gift of comedy.
I rate it 7/10 because it hits my spot when i need a pick me up, perhaps that is too high in this age where comedy is the hardest genre to succeed in, but don't believe the low rating here on this site, it's a delightful little comedy that is far from perfect, but hell!, it's a heavenly piece knowingly incorporating the serious side of religious belief.
I remember watching this back when i was younger and i loved it.
Although it contains only minimal language concerns, it is best when viewed uncensored and uncut--as are most films.
Even years later when I remember something he did I can't help but laugh.
Taking a convict and making him an angel of mercy was quite hilarious, like when he robs the fast food restaraunt to feed the poor and especially the scene where he talks with Charlton Heston as God.
Yeah, and Kent Murdoch (Lew Ayres) was there, ace photographer always with an angle and a wise crack, fast with his words, especially "Now listen, baby..." when he's with a good-looking dame.
Right in the middle of the party, when the flashbulbs are popping, a guy also gets popped.
After the war, when it became known he had served as a combat medic, he gradually began to get film offers but for seldom more than character roles.
Two questions arise when watching a film mixing these 2 genres.
True, he wasn't so great during the scenes of him as a young man, but when he portrayed Wyatt Earp as a famous lawman during the 1880s, he pulled the job off great.
The last "flashback" scene in the film could have been eliminated and a good portion of the the train station scene when Earp looks for those who killed Morgan and injured Virgil.
Personally, I enjoyed both, but the difference is that when I watch Tombstone, I feel like I just watched an entertaining story, whereas when I watch Wyatt Earp I feel like I just saw a piece of history.
(I don't really care who's acting when I go to see a movie and don't study the playbills)
The turning point in the story is when Wyatt's beloved wife dies along with their unborn child.
Eventually, he becomes a lawman and that is when we meet the mysterious and quiet Wyatt Earp that nobody likes.
I'm at a total loss when I read the other reviews about this movie.
Hollywood's version of history is considerably at variance with the facts, and life on the frontier in the 19th century would appear to have been more dull and monotonous than exciting and colorfulÂ Certainly, life in Tombstone, Arizona, in its time of greatest prosperity as a mining town must have been anything but healthy, with its vast number of rough working men relieving their boredom with drinking and brawling, and occasionally shooting each otherÂ  In Kasdan's epic Western, Earp is the upright defender of the law, and Doc, a dissolute gamblerÂ Nevertheless, the men are compassionate and respectful, and both have a kind of dignityÂ Holliday is much more credible as the black sheep of an aristocratic Virginia family and a jaded idealistÂ Dennis Quaid allowed himself to lose 30 pounds of his weight only to accurately portray the gun-notorious Doc Holliday, now, alas devoted to the bottle and in the latter stages of tuberculosisÂ  In this instance we have Quaid breathing fire and fury at the slightest hint of an insult before breathing more heavily into his handkerchiefÂ He's a multi-dimensional human being who provides most of the film's best momentsÂ His character has his own form of abilityÂ Quaid does a far better work of portraying the effects of Holliday's tuberculosisÂ Kilmer, in "Tombstone," never seems to have anything worse than a bad flu, except when it's dramatically necessary for him to look bad in greater degreeÂ   Earp (Kevin Costner) finds Doc sincere but nevertheless strikes up an understanding which one feels will blossom into grudging joint gun-action should the need ariseÂ The need is obviously there in villainous Clantons and McLaurysÂ The path is well and truly pointed to that rendezvous at the CorralÂ  Kasdan's motion picture covers areas of Earp's life that George P. Cosmatos' film "Tombstone" does not even touchÂ While "Tombstone" was an action picture, centering on the events leading up to and including the famous gunfight, Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp" focused on the man himself and his life from childhood to the confrontation and beyondÂThe film starts with the teenage Earp and progresses through old ageÂ   The action in Kasdan's film is firm and fresh, nicely photographed and the story well toldÂ But we always remember Ford's "My Darling Clementine" for its other qualitiesÂfor the unhurried lulls and the 'time off' taken on the wayÂ This is Ford indulging himself, as was his habit, but on this occasion the indulgences all come off and are imparted with magicÂ  "My Daring Clementine" was a film of touchesÂFonda, seated, adjusting his boots and his balance while the world, such as it is, goes by; Fonda, the peacemaker, right-and-properly in church; Fonda, with an old-world frontier concept of courtesy leading his lady in the out of doors danceÂ  Earp in Kasdan's biopic is an ordinary man who met and married a beautiful young woman who died of typhoid a short time after the marriageÂ Profoundly bitter about her death, he goes from a drunken fellow to horse thief to buffalo hunter to stagecoach driver to Dodge City, Kansas where he became one of the most famous "Westerners" of all time...
We really want to turn it off when those kids (screamers in kids bodys) are walking and the main characters going "help me".
So this pile of garbage doesn't get a pass just because of when it was made.
This of course pisses off her family so when he sees this he throws his gun down and runs away like a true soldier.
Meaning I don't think the director knew how to use slow motion effects so he told the actors to move at half speed, which is pretty obvious when they "bash" him in the face with the butt of a gun by gently tapping him on the head.
His wife complains that he neglects her and the baby and you can't blame him when you see what his wife looks like or what the baby looks like for that matter.
The only thing sad about the baby is the fact that this movie isn't a comedy and it's not supposed to make you laugh when you see it.
Then as a gift to anyone watching, the movie comes to an end when the guy can't take it anymore and blows his brains out in his apt.
It was already complete when Troma bought the rights to it.
From this movie you can see, that "eighties/seventies"-type of synthetisizer music and it's sounds can be something else than ridiculous ancient history, when used in the right places.
Sometimes it is better when a director has no money.  
when you do so, you're in for a movie experience you will remember.
He finds it difficult to be a good human being when he looks at the scum around him.
The ending when he finally loses (reminding one of "Taxi Driver") is predictable but still powerful.
The diseased baby(..a victim of Ricky G's effects from Agent Orange)is truly a haunting creation(..it's whining especially grating) and the squibs used when the gun violence erupts(..not to mention the bloody carnage of torn apart corpses in the Vietnam scenes)are quite impressive considering the very miniscule budget.
And up until the "grand finale", you find yourself wondering when hell will break loose.
Abandoned by society and the government that he served, he represents a lot of people who were ignored when they returned back to the "world".
They can also bear witness to the life that surprisingly many Viet-Nam era veterans lived with when  their tour of duty and time with the military was completed.
I was a horny college student when this film was released in 1971, and I recall a big photo spread in "Playboy" promoting the film with revealing images of various "Pretty Maids."
Finally Keenan Wynn gets thrown into the mix as a bumbling local Chief of Police who gets more than he bargained for when he tries to solve the identity of the murderer himself.
(And believe me, I am by no means a prude when it comes to the complex issue of teenage sexuality.)
I realize this was the 70s when free love reigned, but maybe the original novel gave better psychological background for all this casual bed-hopping.
American is far more puritanical today, especially when it comes to the issue of teens and sex.
His downfall starts when his female students want more from him than just sexual favors.
My wife and I saw this flick when it was first released in 1971 and found nothing outrageous about it.
Bridgit, as usual blows town when the going gets too hot and flees to Spain.
I rented The Last Seduction II from Blockbuster when it was first released back in 1998 or 1999.
I was initially intrigued when I saw the title, and I expected an ample follow-up to Bridget Gregory's antics.
At least if you're a Disney fanatic (well, of the variety who loves their live-action films as well as the animated stuff), if you're a kid, if you're a kid at heart almost to the extent that you hardly realize you're an adult, if you love absolutely any film that features animals, especially when they're doing tricks, or if you're just not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is somewhat enjoyable to watch.
Some of the threads should have simply been removed, because it's difficult to become too engaged in the film when as soon as you're introduced to an idea, it's already passed you by.
Unlike the first two films, a dog playing a sport is almost an afterthought here, and when we see him, it's in very quick glimpses; every once in a while, these snippets appear to be even aided by computer animation.
And at times, like the ending, when the film completely abandons consistency and basically becomes a commercial for the U.S. Women's Soccer Team, Air Bud: World Pup is so blatantly tacky that you can't help but love it.
I like when Dolph Lundgren direct Movies.
Being aware of its bad reputation (mostly due to Malcolm McDowell's outrageous contribution as the villain), I decided to give it another look when it turned up recently on Cable TV.
In the face of all this, Michael J. Lewis' sweeping score seems out of place Â especially when considering that the action sequences are too few and far between, and certainly nothing to write home about when compared to the typical war movies of its ilk.
You seem to be doing something different from the rest of us'..."   If after so many years, one performance in a supposedly bad movie stands out and you can't get it out of your mind, and you remember the exact day when you saw that movie, who you saw it with and how you felt, for me it means that the movie was not bad at all.
Not many would come up with The Passage, primarily because it's a largely forgotten film which didn't succeed critically nor commercially even when it was originally released.
this was a handsomely filmed but thoroughly nasty wartime adventure thriller i first saw when it was released way back in '79 about a german scientist (james mason) being smuggled across the swiss alps by a basque guide (anthony quinn) whilst being hotly pursued by a sadistic ss nazi commandant (malcolm mcdowell in a truly hilarious performance).
I remember when I first saw it I was horrified.
All the dead woman had to do was change her will while she was alive   Story two ) A bunch of feminist " lesbian " students find the going tough when their college commitee turn against them though for one of them it leads to a happy ending .
The second film was a good example of the transitionary period when lesbians were removing themselves from the femme/butch sterotypes.
Now I am by far not an expert on all things Dolph, but I can appreciate a decent effort when I see one.
The first segment was almost unbearably sad; the second had you willing the central figure to defy the attitudes of her equally lesbian friends and keep dating the woman who was expressing her individuality a different way, which was anathema to the others because it had "male" characteristics; the third portrayed a loving partnership's efforts to get one of them pregnant, and their joy when they finally managed it, extremely well.
I was sad in the beginning (1961) and just thrilled when coming nearer today, somehow I was much involved to this movie all the time.
The Mechanik is a great action movie, just like in the good old times when action didn't try to bee anything else, but simply action.
The message of this first movie serves well to remind people of the tragedy that ensued when one's life long partner passed on previous to the 70's.
My jaw dropped when Anakin and Ventress fought on Yavin IV for the very simple fact that they were fighting in a thunderstorm.
Nick refuse first , but change his mind when he discover that the girl has been kidnapped by the "godather".
Remember in the original Star Wars when Ben is telling Luke that his father fought in the Clone Wars... well thats what this series is all about.
Odd, then, that the series' major weakness is that there's too much going on, too much action and not enough quiet spots, which makes for a rather relentless and one-note viewing experience when it's not broken up into its original chapters.
There is a lot of violence - the fighting scenes are well orchestrated and look very realistic -it's definitely not one for the kids, and being a fan of gore and splatter effects, I was pleasantly surprised to see that when people got shot, there was a real bloody impact in each scene, that didn't seem at all over the top like some squibs end up looking.
If, when you think of Dolph Lundgren, you only get a picture of him saying "I must break you" from the Rocky film, think again and check this movie out.
I wonder what G. T. was thinking when he made this series so short?
The score by Elia Cmiral is haunting when it needs to be and tense when the crap hits the fan.
I saw this movie when I was little,my mom didn't approve of an 8 year old watching R-rated movies, but my father didn't care ha-HA!
I have been looking for years for this movie, when I did find it, I almost peed my pants (I didn't though, just using as a reference for my extreme excitement).
I first saw this movie when I was about eleven years old.
I started to think when I realized the huge chasm between the two nations' opinions.
However, just for the laughs you can watch it on a day when there's not much to do(I wish I had more of them).
Once, when his wife fly away, he violate the rule.
Belmondo: this is my wife, this is my wife, the elevator has a specific noise, when came my wife.
And what can a man do, when there is a young girl in home, and the wife comes home.
I recently got a PS2 which came with a controller,memory card,3 PS2 games and 1 PS1 game for a good price.I didn't play the GTA series when it first came out starting with GTA3 in 2001.I started loving the series in 2005 when I got GTA Vice City for Christmas.I loved it.I then got San Andreas and thought it was the greatest video game of all time.I had GTA2 as well.Now with my new PS2 I play Liberty City Stories which was originally out for PSP.This game costs $30.00 and it is definitely worth it.Remember this is a PSP port and PSP is not as good as PS2 so the game is definitely not as good as GTA San Andreas or even Vice City actually but it is still a good addition in the series.Liberty City Stories takes us back to Liberty City(where GTA3 took place).The year is 1998 and you play as Toni Cipriani.During the game you do various missions for different people just like in the other GTA games.When you are not playing missions you can steal cars,kill people and just plain be a cold-hearted criminal.The storyline in all the GTA games are good with Vice City having the best one.The storyline in this game is pretty good as well.There are some parts of the game that are not too good.First of all the soundtrack.Just like in Grand Theft Auto 3, aside from the classical music station and the 1980's station the other music is re-created.Not real music.It is re-created well but we want music that was popular for the time.Actually out of the whole series, this game has the worst soundtrack.Flashback FM is the best radio station in my opinion but there aren't that many good songs there either.Even in GTA3 the only good station was Flashback.It had some good songs from the Scarface soundtrack but there were so little songs.I like 80's music and GTA Vice City provided the best radio station with actual songs from the 1980's.San Andreas had classic rock from the 70's and great rap and rock songs from the early 90's.If the soundtrack was better the game would be on-par with GTA Vice City.Anyway Liberty City Stories is a good addition in the GTA series but don't expect that much since its a port from PSP.
who this time uses his special skills for vengeance when his family is wiped out by Russian mobsters however this is just the first fifteen minutes as Lundgren wastes literally no time in delivering payback and it is when he finds out that the mobster lived that it becomes apparent that he must return back to Russia and even the score.
Of course I was mildly surprised by Lundgren's last movie The Defender due to it's good action and solid story however I generally don't rent straight to video movies because I got burned way too many times, however when this came on TV I saw it and was VERY impressed with it.
The Russian Specialist is a throw back to the Charles Bronson days when the heroes dispensed ruthless justice and walked away with an ending that was happy for everyone but them.
I have to wonder what goes through people's minds when they put up money to have drivel like this made.
I never thought the time would come when Adam Sandler would no longer be funny.
I was very eager to see this film when I saw the trailer, but damn I was wrong about it.
The film gets more complex when Zohan reaches America.
Malls are good, capitalism works when it's personal, religious and racial differences are illusory or superficial, blanket bigotry is the province of greedy white men, and heterosexuality and monogamous marriage is a natural part of growing up.
I've fallen by the wayside a little in recent years, and haven't kept up to much with the action boys, but when your in the mood, your in the mood.
Zohan (Adam Sandler) is cooking fish at the beach when his superiors interrupt his vacation and inform him that the dreaded Arab terrorist, the Phantom (John Turturro of "Transformers"), is up to his old tricks again.
Zohan practices cutting Gail's hair when he isn't having in lusty sex with her.
One day when one of Dalia's hair stylists doesn't show up, Zohan takes advantage of her absence to cut hair.
To comment on this movie, there are two main sides: First one would be Adam Sandler, I have always liked his movies, for the light kind of comedy he presents, you watch and you laugh but you don't expect to come out of the movie with a deeper message or something remotely philosophic to think about, I find that when Adam Sandler tries to go deep, his movies become quite depressing and nonsensical, "Click" quickly comes to mind.
The only redeemable parts were when the Palestinians and Isrealis come together in the end but it wasn't enough to save the movie.
I am not an Adam Sandler fun, but I appreciate his work when he do something good.
It felt preachy about tried to teach tolerance when it came to people from the middle east but came off unbelievably stupid.
"Why does Adam Sandler always have to play the role of a super savvy cool-guy when the only reason anyone really liked "Happy Gilmore", "Billy Madison", "Bulletproof", "The Wedding Singer", "Big Daddy", "Little Nicky", or "Mr.
Overall, I give this movie a 2 out of 10 because there were a total of three times when I chuckled at the movie.
I must say that I was personally a bit confused when I saw the rating on this movie.
It's like the school-yard bully who beats the snot out of you all semester but wishes you a good summer at when vacation time rolls around.
Although I found myself laughing at quite a few parts (particularly when the Zohan was on the job as a soldier), there were also a lot of parts where I was thinking to myself "Come on.
And frankly, I think I prefer Sandler when he just tries everything.
Yes, Jenny was in her late 30s when she made the movie but because practically everyone is above a certain age, this gave the movie a sorta poky feel to it, which was the last thing THE DARK TOWER needed.
Architect Agutter is haunted by her dead husband in a skyscraper she designed, and when people start getting knocked off mysteriously detective Moriarty comes in to investigate.
I saw this movie when it came out in 1984 and I have been looking for a copy, now that I can afford the price.
Seven years later Nick is working in LA, illegally, as a mechanic when he is approached to do a job.
They meet at a Naval base hospital where Wahl has taken an injured soldier for emergency care, but complications ensure when he tries to carry on a relationship with her in the middle of wartime.
This movie was just released at the wrong time, when audiences were expecting only angry, hard-hitting social commentary.
"Purple Hearts" is another example of why Furie is the Rodney Dangerfield of film directors, never receiving any respect when it is due.
I haven't seen a lot of Umberto Lenzi's movies (I've only seen CANNIBAL FEROX and NIGHTMARE CITY, which I both enjoyed), but to me it seems he's just a mediocre Italian director when it comes to horror-movies.
Nothing happens for the majority of the movie and when it does pick back up towards the end it's still pretty lame.
Ghosthouse - La Casa 3 (aka House: La MaldiciÃ³n Final) was released in the eighties when the House franchise was a pretty big business, not so big as the Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street franchises but something important.
Even when they found the transmitter of Jim, they couldn't understand how the signals were conceived.
It was a very low-budget show with the characters were put together using wooden spoons and tin cans but it worked when complimented with simple story-telling and a solid musical score.
For example, when Tina is cut in half, when Jim gets it in the neck with the fan blade, the blood coming from the faucet...etc.
Young Caleb gets Lucinda's paper, and his father John - an MIT astrophysics professor who lectures his class about the competing theories of randomness vs. purpose - becomes fascinated with it and finally realizes that it's a list of dates when tragedies will happen, showing not only when they'll happen but where and how many will die.
When Rose died , Cage's character tried to explain to his son at the end that she had died , his son simply stated that she would be OK , how would she be OK , she was dead and why have the stone in her hand when she died , what was its significance?
Considering the average of the movie evaluation was 6.5/10 at IMDb when I had watched knowing, I was highly disappointed eventually.
The central question of 'Knowing' is clearly stated at the beginning of the film by Cage's character when he asks his students in a lecture whether they think the universe is inherently deterministic or a series of random events.
And yet, when I think about "2001: A Space Odyssey" I must admit that 'Knowing' pales in comparison.
I know you should not question too closely when it can spoil your enjoyment of the experience, but with Knowing the end was really too much of a let down.
And sure enough, they happen when they say they are going to happen killing the number of people that Lucinda recorded.
So it was heartening to hear the praise that was heaped on Knowing when it was released, with some even going so far as to call it perhaps the greatest sci-fi movie ever made.
After he stumbles upon that most memorable of dates when the twin towers were brought down he finds that beside that date is written the number of people who died.
Naturally, he brings it home when he's not supposed to.
Some day when you are in the mood for a really wooden, lifeless, and uninspired performance, the kind only Cage can deliver, watch it on Netflix.
What is the point of giving an astrophysicist a list of predictions and telling him when the world is going to end if there's nothing he can do about it?
The best part was when the lead female role was killed.
First of all, yes I did see this movie, and no I'm not much of a talker when it comes to discussing and reviewing movies.
The plot turns around John Koestler (Nicolas Cage), an MIT astrophysics nerd turned Indiana Jones when a time capsule is discovered at his young son Caleb's (Chandler Canterbury) school.
Of course, there's no mention at all of all the proofs of evolution, even when Cage is supposed to be this serious MIT teacher.
Trudi is a bad girl but when it comes down to it, she will do what is right for her.
I was young when I hired this movie classic and admit I was scared out of my wits!
I love it when she blends one in the mixer and then fries one in the microwave.
Then when you see all the Gremlins walking into town you appreciate that they are not real.
She has such a great artistic vision when it comes to camera angles, lighting, cinematography, and music.
But hey, when in life are any loose endings tied up?
My friend and I saw Eddie Macon's Run at the theater when it was first released.
I enjoyed it as much as I did when I was in my late teens.
I saw this movie when it was released.
All of these elements will keep you entertained during the first portion of the movie, "Gizmo" especially, but it's when the Gremlins arrive that the real fun starts!
Part of its attraction when I was growing up, I think... To give the impression that only kids will enjoy it is false though.
And it had more warmth in it than the movie I imagined after reading two or three reviews in New York papers when it was showing there at the IFC in autumn, 2005.
William Keane is a man who experiences every parent's worst nightmare when he loses his young daughter in a New York City bus terminal.
For, when all is said and done, the film is really a study of a man's ever-spiraling descent into paranoia and madness - with barely a glimmer of hope that he might possibly be saved in the end.
The moments where he cared for Kira as his own daughter seem to momentarily suppress our perspective of his condition, but when he starts to put her in situations that suggest a setup for someone to potentially abduct her, we know he is still unstable and it keeps us guessing as to just what he is planning since he's spent a good deal of time reviewing his daughter's kidnapping over and over again, attempting to orchestrate what could have gone differently.
Sometimes he has quiet periods when he will use a disability check to buy himself some shelter in a seedy extended stay hotel.
The woman entrusts Keane with the care of her daughter when she leaves to sort out her marital problems in another city.
Keane patrols the hustling bustling Port Authority Bus Terminal of New York City where he was with his daughter when he took his eyes off her for a brief moment only to lose her possibly forever.
Keane recognizes in himself what he used to be Â a father to a young girl Â and becomes a defacto member of this temporary family when Lynn asks him to watch over Kira and the results are heartbreaking.
We are never 100% certain if in fact he had a daughter but I'd hedge my bets that Kerrigan is too sharp to fool his audience into false beliefs (I recognized one gut-wrenching clue when William mentions to a ticket clerk he lost his daughter on September 11th) particularly Lewis' gentle interplay with the natural born Breslin, a very excellent young actress who also shines in her sad, shy Kira, a child who is suffering as well inside and eventually blossoms into happiness and can see that there is more than meets the eye with William (who's final act has all the suspense of a melodramatic thriller in what the audience fears his truth to become).
We feel his agony when no matter how he tries, he can't keep up that lucidity 2 days in a row.
Also when he takes care of another child while it's mother is gone for a few days, you start wondering if Keane is not going to hurt or kidnap this child!
We can viscerally feel his efforts to control his thoughts and behave responsibly when the stakes are very high.
i saw this when i was about 5 and i was convinced that gizmo was real.
this film seems to be on every christmas here so when i watch it it always brings back good memories.
Then you start to see how tortured he is, especially when you learn he's suffering from schizophrenia and he's basically self medicating himself.
You get that feeling when you are watching 'Keane.'
But it's not needed to have someone shout the hero's name, especially when the hero is either fighting, saving someone, trying to get something done, does his own thing, or is busy.
So it comes as a shock when the boy who owns him ends up breaking the three important rules that he must abide by, and all hell breaks loose!!!
The music plays a pivotal role in letting us know when we should be scared or when we should laugh.
The actors are not actually bad, they just made terrible career decisions when saying yes to this piece of crap movie.
And when the three of them finally sit down together next to the pool, Monk whips off her tiny swimsuit and sits down nekked, except it just isn't funny or arousing or anything.
People lobby to get, what is to them, grotesque and disgusting films censored; banned; pulled; destroyed; locked away in a vault somewhere so that no one can find them Â but where are these people when Date Movie is released?
Where are these people, in their infinite wisdom, when this faux-harmless spoof comedy is released into the mainstream multiplexes, capped at PG-13/12A, for everyone to roll in and get their kicks out of?
I like Alyson Hannigan, I confess when I was 10 I was addicted to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and I think she was trying her best with superficial material.
Awful awful awful, the reason i saw this movie was: I was surfing through channels on TV and i stopped when i saw Eddie griffin on the bus and i thought, hmm he made another movie.
!The only real funny part was at the starting when Alyson Hannigan was trying to be sexy,and that wasn't even all that funny.I think Date Movie was a useless piece of junk that should have never been made, because it hurt's the good name of spoof movies everywhere, basically meaning the Scary Movie series.I thought that Date Movie was one of the grossest, sloppiest movies ever as well.I mean, I can stand some gross humor, but this film went a little to far, and I am ashamed that the people in this film agreed to act in this nonsense, especially Alyson Hannigan.So I warn you, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!
I took my sister to see this movie on President's Day when we both had the day off.
Nearly 98% of the jokes I had to tell my sister I would explain to her when she was older.
I remember the first time I ever saw this great film was at an old drive in theater in my area when I was very young and to this very day, it remains one of my favorite films of all time.
The scenes just made no sense when you watch them all as one movie, they even had movie spoofs of films that came out literally like 6 months ago.
For instance, when the cat is sitting on the toilet with diarrhea for two whole minutes.
It was comical for the first thirty seconds, but after that you start to impatiently wonder when this scene is going to end.
Even more so is the opening sequence when Alyson Hannigan is dancing through the street in a fat-suit.
I'm sorry, but was I supposed to laugh when Alyson Hannigan popped a huge zit on her face and the force of the "stuff" coming out catapulted her through a wall?
As gross and ridiculous as all that is, the worst is when some old woman is having a romantic dinner with a fake cat and later makes out with it.
Laughs are supposed to ensueÂ   Just when you thought Hollywood has reached an all time low comes "Date Movie," a movie that proves that anything can be made into a film in Hollywood and no matter how bad something is people will dish out their hard earned money to see it.
This is a question I wondered when I first heard about the movie and now after seeing "Date Movie" I know it can't be done and shouldn't even be attempted.
I guess you should know that a movie is really bad when it's not screened for critics and the trailer tries to sell you a movie by saying "from 2 of the 6 writers of Scary Movie" but there is always that small part of me that says it can't be as bad as it looks but in this case it's worse than it looks.
These guys have no right what so ever to make a movie when they put out a movie like "Date Movie."
And Hollywood wonders why ticket sales are going down because when you pay $6-$10 to see a movie like "Date Movie" I can totally understand why people aren't going and would be leery of what Hollywood puts out.
This movie doesn't even deserve a 1 because nothing worked at all and people shouldn't have to be tortured like this when they see a movie.
I mean you know something is wrong when the funniest part of a movie is a cat crapping into a toilet.
I really have to say it's as witty as it gets when Frodo delivers a swift kick to the nads of Gandolf, and he screams, "My precious!"
Gremlins probably is under rated, but it thourougly delivers when your looking for a comedy and a bit of tame horror(theres hardly any).
We went to the theater about 15 minutes early and when we first came in we were the only ones there, which surprised us.
Surprise, surprise, as old pal Gomer Pyle used to holler when he found out something surprisingly pleasant - and Moon 44 is all that and more.
The fact that we barely ever see Gizmo's feet when he runs, or the Gremlins lower bodies is wonderful.
It's never a good sign when the DVD costs just Â£1 and comes in one of those very thin cases.
Neither is it when there's just the bald title printed on the disc and there's no additional material.
But like too many in the Spielberg/Lucas action-fantasy genre, film is gory, unpleasant and mean-spirited when the going gets tough.
I think the only thing that made me chuckle at all was the very end of the movie when Michael Douglas' character is hitting on the other 'ghosts'.
At a screenplay level, what did someone see when they green-lit the script?
To the great actors Michael Douglas and Robert Forster, I ask: "What were you thinking when you agreed to appear in this film?"
Arrogant playboy bachelor photographer, Connor Mead (Matthew McConaughey of "Failure to Launch"), dumps three women during a conference call when he feels that they are complicating his lifestyle.
He opposes marriage on any grounds later to his childhood sweetheart Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner of "Juno") when they collide with each other again at the wedding rehearsal dinner for his kid brother Paul (Breckin Meyer of "Road Trip") and future wife Sandra (Lacey Chabert of "Black Christmas") in Newport.
Connor is standing in the men's room when Uncle Wayne materializes at a urinal and relieves himself.
When Connor tries to touch him to prove that Uncle Wayne is only a figment of his imagination, Uncle Wayne shrinks away from him: "Don't touch a man when he is hanging a wire."
Later, when Connor goes to his bedroom for a rendezvous, he finds red-headed Allison Vandermeersh (Emma Stone of "Superbad") waiting for him.
He sneaks off into the night and she doesn't speak to him again until ten years afterward when they meet at Paul's wedding.
Who would forget the early nights before Christmas, when young Billy Peltzer (Zach Galligan) receives the cute furball Gizmo as a present fro his dad (Hoyt Axton)?
And who would also forget the bad results when the three very important rules (1.
having watched Jenifer Garner in P.S I Love you i expected a lot from her in this film, but instead of being a leading role as she was a vital part of the plot she felt a lot like an addition to the thin story line, most of the time she looked like she was tripping over her tongue when Connor Mead was mentioned.
If you are a fan of romantic comedy, yes, you will be in your element when you sit down for a showing and most others will find the film bearable.
But, even so, lower your expectations just a tad, for then you will not be disappointed when you realize it is not in the same company as such classics as Notting Hill or Return to Me.
My favorite thing about this movie was it shows you to change you life around when something is not going right or that life isn't what you expected.
Also check out Garner in her latest movie, "The Invention of Lying" when that comes out on video soon.
Men, when you're dragged by your fem-boss like the vagina-whipped pussy you've become, to see GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST, at least take solace in the film's educative axioms during its first act.
Michael Douglas's ghost is hilarious when he's telling truths about staying powerful in relationships, but it's all for naught, as he is stuck in a Chick Flick that will ultimately emasculate him and make him confess that philandering will leave you lonely.
I usually like these kind of movies, even when the majority of people don't...from movies like Sydney White, Princess Diaries, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and 13 going on 30 to Mean Girls.
Other than Mean Girls, the rest aren't hugely clever, witty or original, but nevertheless, they are movies that I enjoy to watch when I feel like a no-brainer movie-watching session.
So, when I saw the trailer for this, I thought, "wow, maybe a slightly original twist for a change...might be worth a couple of hours of my time."
One scene that I shook my head in utter disbelief was when the lead character just groped an older lady's breast at a bar, and yet she made no effort to slap him or talk him down...would women seriously let a guy do this?
The only good parts or vaguely amusing were...and I'm really scraping the barrel here, were the times when Lacy Charbert freaked out in the way she does best a la Mean Girls.
Do yourself a favor and rent it when it comes out, at Redbox for $1.
We are lead to believe that Jennifer and Matthew were childhood sweethearts (that never kissed) who lost touch at 14 then reconnected at 24 when he not only breaks her heart but actually destroys her.
The three bridesmaids are dimwits pining to sleep with Matthew and when that fails they scrape the bottom of the barrel groomsmen because they just need a man.
Oh and when he's taking pictures at the wedding.
This is what happens when you have good actors in a movie together.
If the producers actually had an idea of when to release the film they should have done it around Christmas because of the closeness to "A Christmas Carol" and people don't mind a corny film or a corny song because it's Christmas...instead it seems like everyone got it wrong with this one
(Admittedly I wandered in from one theater to another when the movie I paid for proved to be a bust, so I can say I split the cost, but even then I feel a little cheated.)
Only the physical attractiveness of the players might cause a viewer to pause when scanning the channels with the remote control.
Only made-for-TV folk think it does not matter when the actors are clearly seen wearing underwear during "nude" love-making scenes.
There are just so many holes in this epic - when trying to determine if someone is really your daughter and hundreds of thousands of dollars are at stake - no DNA testing ???
Also, where was roger's body when the police and paramedics came?
Remember, when her husband showed her the pictures and she found out that the girl was in a scam with the investigator, she didn't disown the girl as her daughter.
Only the physical attractiveness of the players might cause a viewer to pause when scanning the channels with the remote control.
Only made-for-TV folk think it does not matter when the actors are clearly seen wearing underwear during "nude" love-making scenes.
Josh would have been around ten years older than Eastwick, yet they appeared to be the same age when they got old.
Accuracy of age, particularly where children are involved is paramount when making films.
So I just thought I would share this info with you as I had previously tried for years to get hold of this fantastic little known miniseries without success.Remembered watching it when it originally aired on BBC in 88/89 and since then it has always stuck in the back of my mind as aone of those "Must own" series.
I watched this epic when it was first released on Aussie TV.
I was in Australia when this miniseries premiered, and raced home each night to watch it.
Holy crap when i was a kid and saw this movie...well the first time i saw it i was 5. didn't think it was scary at all and loved it, until that night when i went to bed..i had nightmares for the rest of elementary school.
and i hated the movie from then on out...but as i hit middle school i basically mentally prepared myself over middle school about it and finally 8th grade year i watched gremlins: the movie that scared the sh** out of me when i was little.... And boy i don't know what i was missing.
I somehow missed this show when it was on TV, but I was happy I found it as many of the themes are reminiscent of Louis L'Amour stories.
Not much in the acting or dramatic department but who cares when the action is this hot.
There are many "poser" moments as well, which gives the movie a certain "sexy" look as characters preen and pose when they deliver their dialogues.
Zhou looks cool when she as Mingming.But her acting is limited in this movie,which is awful & boring.From 2003,Zhou's acting is narrow and powerless,for example,Baby in Love,Beauty Remain & A West Lake Moment.
The gremlins are the scene stealers here, at first they are very cute then all of a sudden when they start causing carnage they are quite the opposite.
This definitely makes my top 10 plot a man named randy peltzer is looking for a present for his son billy Peltzer just as he seems to have run out of luck he discovers a small Chinese shop and a strange creature known as a Mowgli after a small argument with the shop owner randy finally gets it when the owners grandson gives it to him as well as telling him three rules 1.
A friend and former roommate and I just happened to be sitting around watching TV, not expecting anything special, when this came on.
It really needs improving here and there and WHY can't I die when I jump off the Empire State Building.
i was expecting this to be one of my favorite games ever because ultimate spider-man and spider-man 2 games are my favorite games ever but this isn't huge let down its just conclusion of the game is bad if you seen the film harry dies he also dies in the game but when its all over they completely forgot about that and story mode is short to atleaset on the ps2 version but swinging around new york is just pure fun so is story mode but its disappointing that it is so short and playing has black suit is fun but its to bad you cant after you beat the game.
However, when the Black Suit gets to be too much power for Peter, he takes it off and it bonds with Eddie Brock, creating Venom.
Morbius and Shriek take up most of the story and make you wonder if you're ever going to get to Sandman and Venom, and I got a little confused when I read on the box "CHOOSE between 5 different story lines".
Zach Galligan plays Billy a young bank clerk, when his father (Hoyt Axton) brings him a some what unusual Christmas gift, a creature known as a mogwai which they name Gismo; his life changes dramatically.
A fun flick when you have the gang over with a fridge full of Pabst.
Even though the humor was dark and cruel,it was hysterically funny.For a movie made on a very low budget,this was impressive.It began with a gory scene in a thunderstorm and then begins years later.The actor that played Monty was perfectly cast.I loved it at the end when he got back at his tormentors since they sure had it coming!
I must say I wasn't expecting much from this when I bought the DVD, but ended up having an absolute blast.
Still that makes all the more amusing when the movie goes all out slasher in the final 20 minutes or so.
Just when you're thinking 'I know whats going to happen now ....' it doesn't.
I thought Feast was a satisfying film.I will say I was just a little disappointed, because I was expecting a tad bit more, but still, it was very enjoyable, and even though at some parts I felt as if they overdid some stuff a bit, it contained cool action scenes, and I believe really lovable characters.Also, they kind of throw you off guard, and do some of the things that you least expect, such as how they killed of Heroine, which when I thought since she was like, one of the most important characters of the story, they would've kept her alive, and also at the part where one of the creatures devours that child, I wasn't expecting that either, which I believe was clever that they were able to do that.There was even pretty laughable comedy, which one of the best mixes of genre is Horror/Comedy, and like I said before, I was really into the characters, like the old woman and Tuffy were some of my favorites in Feast.This was a good movie, and I think it has a pretty reasonable rating, so I have nothing further to say, except that if you absolutely flat out hated this movie, you DEFINITELY need to watch it again, and maybe you'll see the error of your ways.
Coolest was when whatever those creatures were had porn sex outside, Funny as all hell.
A bunch of people in a bar are slightly distressed when a blood-covered, shotgun-wielding "hero" bursts in and warns them all about ravenous, speedy creatures travelling not far behind him.
I can understand why some people wouldn't be able to stomach this film, particularly when Kate (Phoebe Cates) tells the story of why she doesn't celebrate Christmas.
Before I go, I want to say that writer turned director Chris Columbus's script does beg questions such as: If the wrong time to feed "Gizmo" is after midnight, when does the right time begin?
The action starts hot and heavy when Eric Dane walks into the bar with one of the creatures.
'Feast' is one of those horror movies that redefine a certain genre.In this case, 'Feast' redefines the man eating monster genre.The monsters in this film snatch up their victims one by one in grizzly and gory fashions.Even a young boy meets his own brutal fate.The monsters move so fast when they kill someone that you can hardly see them.Maybe you can see glimpses of them, but that's about it.Now that was a problem for me.
I have been making my way through some horror movies I had not seen yet (May, A Tale of Two Sisters, etc...) when I ran across this title.
The cinematography is good in some areas when it is not shaking from cut scene to cut scene so fast that it makes you wonder if you are having a seizure or watching a movie.
For the life of me, I still see no reason why the monsters decide to wear clothing and bulls heads when the bull skulls don't even cover where their heads are located.
There were moments when I was seriously shocked by the blatant violation of standard horror conventions.
This movie used to scare me immensely when I was younger.
I watched it when I was three, and while it did scare me there for a while, I still loved it a lot.
But then again this was the heyday of social liberalism during the New Deal when it was believed all of life's ills could be cured with the right government social program.
Henry Fonda knew the secret to getting and keeping a pretty girl: Get thrown in the slammer and when you get out take her to a few good bank robberies.
One of my very favourite films and further proof, if needed, that Fritz Lang did not leave his best work behind in Germany when he fled the Nazis for Hollywood in the early 30's.
A miracle is offered, but it arrives when he's distracted, at his most hopeless.
I first saw this film when I was 5 and I am ashamed to say that it scared me.
This keeps the viewer guessing as to whether Fonda's proclamations of innocence are true when he is arrested.
Henry Fonda is a petty crook attempting to reform when he is framed on a murder charge.
And when the show was hitting on all cylinders it was an absolute riot.
You could depend upon it when you tuned in.
It makes sense the same way it makes sense that the type three is not attacked by the screamers, when you understand what it really is.
OK, this has to be one of the best films I have ever seen, I saw it about 5 years ago when I was eight and can still remember it so well!
Am absolutely gutted that I missed it and would be grateful if anyone could tell me when it was next on Sky.
Anyway, an amazing film and I'll comment in a few days when I have fully watched it!
There are moments in the film, especially when they go upstairs for the first time to look for the alien where the suspense is almost unbearable.
This is also heightened at times just before a crucial moment when the film halts and a message appears to warn you about the following scenes, very effective.
A minor triumph in independant cinema, for a tv film, I was thoroughly entertained, and even scared on occasion, which I don't think I actually have been before when watching a movie.
But special mention has to go to the mother, who at no point was seen without a glass of wine in her hand, even when the family try to escape!
Zach Galligan makes the most of his film debut as Billy Peltzer, the young hero who tries to stop the gremlins; Phoebe Cates is effective as his girlfriend; the late Hoyt Axton is a hoot as the inept inventor father (some of his crazy inventions are hilarious, especially when the inventions backfire into slapstick catastrophes); Frances Lee McCain is good as the mother and housewife (who has one big scene with the nasty critters); Polly Holliday is wickedly funny as Mrs. Deagle, the meanest woman in town; and Dante regular Dick Miller is a riot as Mr. Futterman, the nice man who's always complaining about hand-made products being made out of foreign parts.
In a way like when you are really bored and find yourself watching "days of our lives" just cos the 'over acting' is quite odd.
The son with the camera runs upstairs to his room to change his pants and that's when he encounters a alien that seems to hypnotize him, but somehow he ends up going downstairs to eat dinner again.
I was so scared all night, that when my alarm went off for me to go to wake up for school, I was so terrified, that I just let it ring for 20 minutes afraid to move!
Bottom line - other than a couple of glitches (which I am sure to find when I watch the movie for the 2nd and 3rd time), a really brilliant movie.
Now when watching this we know that its not real because it shows the aliens craft and what they look like and this would be hard evidence of the existence of aliens and this wasnt in the news.
The video left you with a lot of suspense as it would just show scenes and actually leave huge gaps of time making you wonder what happened especially when characters started to disappear.
I saw it 8 years ago when I was 10 and now I am finally seeing it again now that I can understand that it's fake.
Well, i cant believe what a film that was, If you are like me, then you will find that horrors nowadays are not what they used to be, But JACKPOT BABY, I mean i know that it is made in 1998 but it does not stop it from being probs one of the greatest horrors to be made, Right from the start it actually maintains the course of looking like a genuine home video, and when they realise the aliens are actually after them, The horror on there faces, Some believe Sum Do not, it is just brilliant, And the Way that they portray that Rosie has been taken over somehow is just brilliant, Also they bring in the racist side of it tackling that view with great authority, they make every bit of the film as enjoyable as the ever, People who are looking for flaws in the film i have this message( My God Get A Life ) its a film go bloody have a pop at a Disney film or summit, As for me This is Danny Robinson Signing out with a big 10 outa 10
anyway i thought this film was real when i first seen it and i couldn't go anywhere alone i became paranoid that the aliens were gonna come get me.
i think this film is psychological and really gets to you.evan thought this film was fake some say it actually happened and this was the remake, ethier way it still freaks me out to this day not as much but i get those shiverer's down my back when i watch it.
I am usually not scared by films, only the Exorcist has had any sort of effect on me and I was 11 when I saw that.
I found out it was a fake because of the research I had done on the film when I was looking for it online.
Scared the hell out of us, but what doesn't when you're 8 years old.
The bickering between the 3 men was starting to bore me and I was about to flick to another channel, when they introduced the aliens and the ship.
when the film came out on TV around 98 or so I saw it and thought it was the best sci-fi film that was ever made.....bare in mind I was 8.
And the concluding story to her so called "calm acting" was when at the end when the aliens walked in she didn't even get drawn to the aliens like the rest, she just walked to join her flock.
And if you didn't pick up on this, the choice of putting her photo last out of the whole family (when if you think about it, it should be Tommy), and giving that image more on screen time than the rest shows she had some significance.
I never knew any of these actors when I saw the movie, so maybe I was at an advantage rather than always thinking "Thats the guy from Stargate!".
One of the talking heads featured in the film pretty much sum it up when he says: "The film really scared me....it was obvious that the people in the film were not trained actors."
Club Sand however, is nothing like the brochures, and everything from rude help, horrible accommodations, terrible food (when it can be found), over-sexed guests and even a burgeoning rebellion on the resort island conspire to make the Lollars' vacation anything but an escape.
It's an absurd movie but maybe you have to have seen it 20 times when you were 19 (and entertainment choices were more limited than they are now) to really appreciate it.
How can there be screenwriters when this film doesn't even have a real plot?
I saw this movie when it was released in 1951.
Being a golfer and a fan of the sport for many years, I was very interested in seeing this, which I did when the VHS first came out.
For example, when Yeoman Rand brings lunch to Mr. Sulu, or when Capt.
Kirk is eating a snack while on the bridge conducting a search, or when Uhuru is trying to make small-talk with Mr. Spock while he's at the helm.
We learn how intensely Kirk feels when he loses a crewman - check out the first killing here - and he has to go thru it a few more times in this episode.
AhhÂnevertheless, there is that one brief shining moment when this really shapely little number comes out of nowhere to peel down to pasties and fringed g-string that makes the whole 70 minutes worthwhile.
But, things get complicated when innocent Ms. Marquis goes home to live with Mother Compson.
Drake Hamilton's (Robert Kellard) mission becomes complicated when his fiancÃ©e is set up to make a call on him as a 'date' from the escort service, but the arrangement is so awkward you'll wonder why June (Margaret Marquis) just didn't explain the whole story when she got to his room.
I'm always amazed at the way times have progressed when it comes to how expensive things are today.
At first I was disgusted, but then when I started to get to know Art (poor big, rich teddy bear character), I couldn't help following his plight and unbalanced relationship which develops with his co-star (West - twisted, disenfranchised, sociopath) until the film presented a resolute conclusion.
for anyone who wants a complete change of pace when looking for a comedy.
has been discussed, praised, shunned, ripped and probably copied since, that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genius-ly original film, and when experienced over and over again, STILL never fails to amuse.
Disgust, hate, happiness, sad, pain, intrigue, and most of all, I laughed, when I probably shouldn't have.
I saw "I'm Telling You For The Last Time" before I actually got into the series itself (I was young when it first aired and so now I am feasting off reruns).
Of course it's much funnier when you can can see and hear him tell the jokes and so if this ever comes on TV again you can bet I'll be taping it.
I really liked this film when I saw it the first time in the 80's on television.
I was a preteen when I first saw this movie and I can remember going into my mother's medicine cabinet and taking some of her Alka Seltzer just to try it with chocolate sauce... After growing and having kids of my own...
So there I was, enjoying this weird and weirdly detailed movie with weird animation and a weird mix of styles (including real faces photographed for the expressions), and the credits start rolling when I think, "Wait a minute, is this music Joanna Newsom?"
It's not the story that's the point, or the relative clarity in the moments (in Newsom's work, the lyrics, in this movie, moments like when the heroine tries to learn music), it's the saturated tone of it all.
But when things like this come together so well and involve so many different styles and talents, it stands out as a beacon for deranged creativity, the chance that one person's unique taste will find other muses to create new expression.
He died when his couch caught fire after falling asleep with a lit cigarette on December 12th of the same year.
Yes, there are parts that are stupid, like when Bronson forces the french babe to drink alcohol.. What kind of technique is that??
I bought a VHS copy of Rider on the Rain in the early 90s when a video store was going out of business.
I saw this movie two or three times in the theater in 1971, when I was ten years old.
Jack Cassidy died not long after this episode was released; he died in bed when his cigarette caught his mattress on fire - a very 70's way to die compared to today's peanut-allergic world.
I first saw this movie when I had a trial subscription to Showtime, and a brand new VCR, and I recorded it in VHS.
I'm usually unaffected by romantic comedy, but I really enjoyed this film when I caught it late night many years ago on a cable channel.
Due to his business taking a nosedive and his debts rising out of control, pretentious Montreal architect Dominique suddenly finds himself in need of a job and is desperate to hide his predicament from his young wife and family - but what do you do if being gay is a requirement when your perfect job comes along?
The confrontation with his wife when she learns of his "alternate lifestyle" is priceless.
Mr.Claypole was always misinterpreting instructions - once, when asked to help Fred's parents move house - he did exactly that.
Even at the end when Columbo has him dead to rights and shows him the paper which contains the incriminating eveidence against him, Santini says" This one is burned!"
The film is one of the first full features made in Cambodia since the 1970's when the Khmer Rougue Regime took over.
I urge you to make better use of your time than to watch this crude, unfunny, MTV-made parody, especially when there are so many great things to explore on the Extended Edition DVD.
well whoever she was supposed to be, she was good, comical at most points, and especially at the end when she ripped the ring from jack's privates.
Cassidy's secret is that he was a guard in a concentration camp when he was young and it simply wouldn't do much for his career if his previous identity were to be leaked out.
"The trick is told when the trick is sold.")
I did not watch the 2002 MTV Movie Awards, but when I downloaded this 3-minute spoof from Kazaa, I found myself strangely entertained at this little piece.
Being a fan of "JAG" and its topical stories, I knew that this show couldn't be that bad, but due to my work schedule wasn't able to watch it when the first season debuted.
This is the best series I ever saw, Except then when agent Caitlin Todd died :(.
Otherwise, when I catch on to what is happening I realize I've enjoyed figuring out the threads & in the end the stories are pretty good.
I've spent many years watching shows that really lacked a strong female character and I'm tired of getting frustrated when they are supposed to be strong but end up missing every target they shoot at & the male lead comes in and "rescues" them at the end.
There are times when the show is a bit too light-hearted and quirky for my liking but this is easily forgotten when watching some of the more darker episodes.
NCIS had been on TV a while when I got into the series.
I used to see it while flicking through the channels, I quickly flicked over to another channel, just because I didn't think I'd like it but one night when there wasn't much of the TV, I had no choice but to watch it and as soon as the episode finished, I was so blown away by it and I have been engrossed it in ever since.
He is the father, who can be strict and unbending but he clearly cares for his team and goes to bat for them when they are in trouble.
I do like the relationship between Gibbs and Tony, I always laugh when Tony says the wrong thing and gets a slap across the back of the head, that has me in fits of hysterics as the situation is never sent up in the same way.
Okay I'm really starting to get sick of these people who say that this show is a CSI spin off CSI is a bad unbelievable show that is totally fiction they can do forensics in 10 seconds when it takes more then 10 hours, its pure Science fiction CSI is but NCIS is closer to reality its always enjoyable, funny and I'm sure more people would watch it if they could not view it as CSI spin off/Rip off because its not watch one episode and you will see its more about the Federal Agents.
First there's Gibbs the boss played by Mark Harmon, Gibbs is a great character he is serious when it comes to the job but he also has a humour side to him that works well with other characters.
Just when you think he's got away with his crimes, nothing could be further from the truth.
Tony is perhaps the best example of this - when the show started he was a goofy, slightly moronic field agent, and he developed into the professional, trained officer who keeps his sense of humor in check or uses it to his advantage.
Cote de Pablo (Mossad Officer Ziva David) replaced Sasha Alexander (Caitlin "Kate" Todd) and I'm probably in the minority when I say "THANK YOU" to the casting department for that.
The writing on this show, like others, is usually tight but like other shows there are episodes where the writing was clearly 'off' when the idea was dreamt up or the script approved.
It is rare to get a compliment for him; when you get one, don't ask why.
Sometimes he can behave in quite the juvenile way, and when he is, a good headslap by Gibbs will help him put things straight (this two have also what could possibly be the strongest homosexual subtext - more of an almost-text - in TV History).
Tim is a computer whiz, but is at a loss when it comes to social life; has gotten a tattoo on his butt to impress Sciuto - and it worked.
Has been mercilessly teased by DiNozzo when he first joined the team, getting the absolutely-not-flattering nickname 'Probie' ('Pivello' ('Greenhorn') in the Italian Version).
He likes the music Abby plays, but not distorted by speakers, lives with his mother, who, wearing only Chanel NÂ°5 when she goes to bed, hosts very awkward slumber parties and has various dogs, he is the one who has worked the longest with Gibbs and looked like 'Ilya Kuryakin' when he was younger.
Harmon's so sexy in this role and McCallum is always a joy to watch as Ducky especially when he's on the role over various anthropology lectures which to my amusement everyone on that shows roll up their eyeballs.  
Before I saw it, I had little idea what it was about, even when I consulted IMDb.
Martin, in an attempt to understand the Projects problem as explained to his father and family by Tonya, visits the Projects and meets Shawn (the very fine and handsome young actor Paul James) who cautiously helps Martin discover his sexuality only to succeed in allowing Martin to discover his true sexual proclivity but meets a sad ending when he is rebuffed.
I saw this for the first time when I was 13, and have been watching it ever since.
The half hour format makes these a bit lighter than Freaks and Geeks - and when this show was canceled they weren't quite as able to still wrap things up as with the earlier show.
My reaction to "Undeclared" was the same as when "Freaks and Geeks" went off the air - sad that I wouldn't see these characters anymore, but really glad that I'd seen the few episodes made.
However, I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred.
At first Micheal thinks that it was just a hallucination but when he hears about Debbie's death & that of another one of his friends at the sÃ©ance Peter (Mario Ivan Martinez) on the news he becomes convinced that his vision was real.
There isn't even any nudity either, in fact when Micheal & Alexandra have sex it is squeaky clean stuff, Galindo merely shows them kissing each other on the lips while in bed.
One of the cheesiest scenes in slasher history is when Michael goes to Alex's house, becomes mad, and starts shooting!
The scene happens when Alex is in the graveyard...
Will try again with The Yards and eventually Mansfield Park, when it comes to video, but if I don't care for those I'll stick with the Hollywood-released films.
And when her former bridesmaid, Mary McCoy, has her brains accidentally blown out by another IRA bullet, she recruits a friend and they begin to lobby, first in churches and town meetings, then on TV, for a cease fire.
Well, I was born in Belfast in 1960 and lived there till 1982, and I can tell you that when you were yawning at the news about people being murdered, tortured, kidnapped, beaten, burned out of their homes, intimidated and imprisoned without trial, the people I lived among were going through it.
In this short-film, Castro is grilled specifically on dissidents, and the moment of truth comes earlier on, when questioned on the 'closed trials' and why Castro did not allow the prisoners to see their families, Castro, in his unique orator voice asked of Stone, "Why is it that over 800 prisoners held by the United States at Guantanamo Bay have not been allowed to see their families for over two years?"
Why is that when a director decides to make a "Cool" film they completely ignore the things that make films enjoyable, ie a decent story and interesting characters.
Two teenagers, Amy Blue and Jordan White lie in their car pondering the meaning of love and life when Xavier Red jumps into their car and starts the first of a string of violent happenings.
Eventually, they get what they deserve when they run into a gang of crazy nazis.
Generation X director Gregg Araki delivers a gruesome but entertaining look at what can happen when three potentially dangerous teenagers can do when they get very, very bored.
I suppose that, in a way, making a pathetically bad film is daring, especially when you put your name on it.
In a snowy and sinister December at the height of the Victorian Era, Watson, as a teenager, is sent to Brompton, a private school in a fogbound London, when his old one is shut down due to lack of funding.
Things get personal when Waxflatter suffers the same fate and stabs himself in fit of madness.
And speaking of Harry Potter, one cannot deny that JK Rowling was inspired by this film in many ways when creating her Potter universe.
And when I say kids' films I should really play-down the negative connotations of such a label.
spoiler alert:  this movie was so bad, that i did not feel sorry for the protagonist when he was anally raped while having his penis cut off with pruning shears by a band of shirtless neo-nazis while his girlfriend and best friend were wrapped in plastic and beaten.
I wasn't expecting this film to be as good as KALIFORNIA, but i was taken agog when i discovered what it really was.
I usually hate it when a film does these sorts of things, but here it fit perfect.
What makes this scene funny is the fact that they have already murdered several people throughout the course of the film, and yet when they hit the dog, they show more genuine emotion for hitting this animal than for murdering another human being.
There must be something wrong with a film when the only scene in the film where the viewer can feel anything relative to the characters in a regular human being is in a particular scene right at the very end which involves hedge trimmers and Nazis.
The problem arises when it is talked about on local news programs that begin the discussion of how the head was sworn to be talking at the scene of the crime, and how a necklace was found at the scene of the crime along wit several other dead bodies.
The film reveals its thematic message when the most innocent and selfless of its three main characters asks the other, more self-centered, two if they ever think about the meaning of existence.
when violence occurs in this movie it's usually very quick, explicit and bloody.
In fact, when other people finally reach the cabin, it slows the whole thing down.
In the middle of the movie,some totally new characters show up and it's pretty obvious they're only there to get killed by the demons.But then again,what other purposes can characters in a horror movie have anyway?This second movie in the "Evil Dead"-series is kinda different actually,it gets more surreal here,mainly because Ash has really lost it here in the first half,and the demons appear to be even more over-the-top and more evil.However,they both grab themselves together near the end for their final showdown.Ash is accompanied by a bunch of idiots but as they're idiots,they don't help much and get killed in some rather original ways.I'm not sure when this movie is situated,but I'm guessing this movie acts like the first one never existed.Not that it completely retells the story,it merely summarises it.And as I took this walk on gross-out lane,I found myself very entertained,somehow shocked but I don't have a clue by what exactly and I did laugh along with Ash and the deer head I must say.That scene really puts a spell on you.Almost as great as the first one
Bruce Campbell returns as Ash, the foolish but cool hero who has to fight for his life and kill his friends when they get possessed and turn on him.
Then when EVIL DEAD 2 came out director Sam Rami give it a new turn on the first one.
*The Evil SPOILERS 2* Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) go for a weekend in a dingy cabin in the Michigan woods, hoping for a good time, but it seems that Fate has other things in store for them, when they unwittingly awaken the Evil Forces luring nearby, that possess Linda and try to do the same with Ash...
Unfortunately it was being used by professor Knowby while he translated "The Book of the Dead" and when Ash plays the recording evil spirits are summoned.
Having to chop up your girlfriend makes you a little loco and when demonic forces are screwing with you it just gets worse.

The best part - hands down - was when Campbell, after having taken his hand off, places a bucket over it to restrain it and then puts a bunch of books on top.
"The Evil Dead" is probably one of the most popular horror films of all time and it has inspired too many horror flicks to name.It is not only extremely scary,but also gory as hell.In comparison to that masterpiece "Evil Dead 2" is nowhere near as gruesome,but it is still worth checking out.The camera work throughout the film is spectacular and the special effects made by Mark Shostrom are pretty good considering the budget.The cinematography is really beautiful and the action is furious.Some scenes are deliciously funny especially when Ash cuts off his own demon-possessed hand or when a woman swallows a flying eyeball.Sam Raimi was a really talented guy,he could be a real horror master but nowadays he is making Hollywood garbage.What a shame!!
ASH versus his hand is some comic gold and is a great way to give you some breathing room when you're not terrified of what might happen next.
Can you guess it, it's when Ash "saws" off his own hand with a psycho laugh, while blood splatters across his face and his laugh slowly grows into agony and screaming.
The marketing on this film was terrible causing many to pass it by when first released.
I eventually don't laugh about when a man is breaking himself dishes on the head.
I don't think it's funny when a man is repeatedly beaten up by grotesque characters.
For example, when Linda's head tells Ash that "she is being tormented, and suffering in hell; you can feel a little scared but the next scene has a corpse without a head holding a chainsaw.
I was really young when The Jar was on TV, so I don't specifically remember all that much about it, other than it appeared to be very murky and curious.
I remembered many details from it and was amazed when I saw it years later.
If you read the box then you are ready to get your heart warmed when you pop in this Bergman scripted film by Bille August.
He strikes her several times, usually when he has been in the wrong.
He keeps sleeping with his other fiancÃ© without breaking it off when he starts sleeping with Anna, but neither of them can really hold it against him because apparently (though I don't know why) he's such a good person.
Pernilla August deserved her award, I saw every lash landing; All I could think in the last frame when she reaches out to him again was "NOOOOOO!"
It's always kind of staggering to think of other films that deal with love and marriage and the twisted ties that bind when compared to what Ingmar Bergman does in his scripts.
Many specific scenes, like a very harsh (though always under the surface) scene between Karin and Henrik, when she tells him point blank to leave and never come back to see Anna, or when Anna is told after the death of her father Johan (Max Von Sydow, always great to see him even in limited time) about how she destroyed a letter she found that she meant to sent to Henrik.
It's all made for dramatic sake, anyway, but what ends up sticking most is the friction in their marriage early on, when they move away to a small, working-class village where Henrik wants to work as the village pastor.
And with the ending, it's satisfying, in a catharsis way though it's not as great, or even perfect, an ending it could have been had a certain decision been made on Henrik's part when he sees Anna outside.
Gone are the days when audiences would be satisfied watching scenes linger on pointlessly or endure unnecessary sub-plots in the name of entertainment.
There are some deleted scenes on the 3rd DVD & my favourite, which I wished they'd kept in the film, is when Akbar says to Jodhaa whilst out on a hunting trip............well you will just have to buy the whole package to see the scene in question.
The music fits into the film perfectly and vice versa, especially when Akbar goesinto a trance whilst listening to Khwaja Mere Khwaja.
You will be drawn into the prayer just like the emperor when he gets up and shows his excitement to God.
Firstly, there is no proper story line ..... just taking a boy meet girl story and putting it in a historical backdrop doesn't make sense at all .... specially when it is not authentic at all ... its predictable and boring ..... more so because of the constant Urdu dialogs which was hard to comprehend ..... many people are saying that the fight sequence portrayed are good but its not worth it ... when you are portraying a vicious battle a little more gore is expected ... not pushing each other and making them fall to the ground ... thats bogus .... i liked the other films of AG they were good ... but this one is worthless ... the only good thing about the movie is aishwarya her ... acting is really good ... hrithik looks misplaced .... and he is often out of sorts if the role doesn't demand his dancing skills ... so it was expected .... if you do want to watch it ... go with your friends and chat your way ... through the movie .. because what happening on screen will not appeal you at all ... for such a stupendously bad story the movie is painfully long ... on the bright side it gives you a lot of time to talk with your friends ..... and carry some medication it might help .. u may need it ... good luck ...
Even after when I came to know that Ashutosh Gowarikar is directing this movie, one who gave us amazing experience in "Lagaan" and "Swades", I was still skeptical to watch it.
But as a movie critic when I got an invitation to watch first day first show with a guest, my mother convinced me to go and take her too.
I can't believe it is from Mr. Gowarikar who gave us "Lagaan" and brewed the love story between Bhuvan-Gauri-Elizabeth so beautifully even when the plot was about getting rid of the lagaan (tax).
But in Jodhaa Akbar I was cringing in my seat thinking when the movie will end and what the end would be as the story was not developing any climax.
Bollywood's director's may not be the smartest of the lot but these showmen do a disservice to history and reality by painting everything rainbow when India's past is filled with loot and murder by crusaders and "native" Moguls.
It's not a good sign when you're looking at your watch and wondering when is the movie going to end.
I just didn't see a Mughal Emperor when I looked at Hrithik.
His physique is top notch but it's hard to take someone seriously when they have green eyes.
He gains a reputation on the battlefield, which could parallel those in Hollywood in terms of sheer scale and grandeur, even utilizing hordes of marauding elephants and settled into some icky territory when elephants rampage and stomp on soldiers.
There are a numerous plus points in this blockbuster, and if I'm telling you I'm getting the DVD when it's released, I'm already giving this a vote of confidence that it's a contender to make it to my top 10 movies of the year.
So when Sharifuddin got out of his bath and wrapped himself in one, it was impossible not to giggle.
They try to be good and comfortable with each other that's when more problems arise from the enemies.
I did not have much of a choice when my brother-in-law bought a CD of this movie home & my wife insisted that we should view it as a family...I have been hearing rave reviews till now & so was just a little bit intrigued...however after sitting through the entire movie, I am wondering what the hype was all about...without doubt, this is an above-average film and has been made with a lot of care & effort....however does it deserve all the accolades heaped on it...can I, for once, cry out "The Emperor has no clothes"?
Let's take a look at the various reasons why I am panning this movie - 1) Hrithik, with his chocolate boy good looks & razor-sharp features is Bollywood star material...however he does not fit in the stereotype of a powerful Mughal Emperor...when you think about Akbar, a powerfully built, swarthy & regal figure springs to mind and Hrithik is anything but...with his soft, melting eyes he looks more like the poster boy of movies such as Dhoom 2 & Krish...
Period films, when well made are a visual treat.
The chemistry and the directorial genius can be seen in scenes where Akbar acknowledges his ignorance to read and write, his confusion when offered arati, the sparring and scenes when the couple have their private moments.
Let me get rid of the flaws first: Ashutosh Gowariker is not an action director, so the battle scenes and even the action sequences lack panache Â when they could have been executed brilliantly Â especially since Hrithik Roshan can do action fabulously well.
The first battle scenes are reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings, down to the swinging of the swords in linear movement, much like the Elves did when the Orcs attack.
Also the director's vision was to show the Mughal Emperor as a sensitive soul and that is what Hrithik evocatively brings about either in the vulnerability he portrays, while apologising to Maham Anga, or the passion tinged with restraint he exhibits when dealing with his distant wife.
Although perfection comes when restraint is used over unnecessary unravelling and digression.
Roshan is at his best when Akbar is wooing a banished Jodhaa and when he ventures off into his kingdom; in many ways, Akbar remains a symbol of tolerance and benign authoritarianism throughoutÂdespite the fact that he is the one who sets much of the narrative's action into play, surprisingly few scenes give us insight into his inner workings; the opposite is true for Jodhaa.
Nandini was a flighty romantic, Umrao Jaan a forlorn romantic, and Paro a languishing fool who settled for survival when love literally slashed her away.
The film works best when the narrative focuses on the interaction between its two leads who are more similar than they perhaps ought to be: both are icons of physical beauty, sexuality, and glamour, but thankfully this has been tampered down by Gowariker's interpretation of the characters.
But such considerations are immaterial when you're telling a love story.
A young Akbar, sets out to conquer Kingdoms and those who don't join him, are brutally executed but after a while he begins to pardon them and that's when many of his opponents begin to realise that they had and have, misunderstood him.
It also deals with intercaste marriage, which at the time was not heard off due to the fact that when the Mughals invaded India, the Rajput Princesses and Queens became Sati when their husbands, the Kings were killed in battle so as not to be captured and, or, forced to live with the Invaders.
His injuries were related to those of when he was filming for "Krissh."
I'd only seen this movie once before, when I was about 12 or 13.
Milady de Winter was 16 years old not twenty when she married Athos and Athos was 25 read the chapter in the novel Three Musketeers called the wife of Athos.
When D'Artagnan first sees Milady in the beginning of the novel which started in the year 1625 and ended in 1628 Milady was twenty to twenty two years old and towards the end of the novel Athos in the chapter called How Athos found his outfit Athos when he finds out that his wife is still alive describes her as beautiful,tall,well-made,blue-eyed with a strange look to them (which might have inspired the screenwriter of this adaptation to make it appear that Milady was a demon possessed secret Satanist) and blonde who would be 26 to 28 years of age.
The action (well that's when it gets around to it) is too little and unexciting martial arts... because we have to wait through long dry spells of talk.
To begin with, it is based (very loosely) around a truish story... the song itself did cause a stir when reports of its association with suicides were circulated.
At the beginning when the 80 yr old man dropped dead after hearing "the famous song" and people saying that it's cursed, I already had impatience for it.
As the older Watson says in recollection when Holmes finds the trophy with seconds to spare, "It was a wonderful, heroic moment for Holmes.
moment when young Holmes and Watson take off on a pedal-powered flying device to soar over London at night in pursuit of the villain.
I don't know if or when this movie will be wider release in North America.
Unfortunately the good times do come to an end when the Nazis sweep into Hungary and decide forthwith to eliminate the Jewish population.
Stories taking place during the Nazi regime and WW2, especially when made by Germans, sometimes tend to be ultra-politically-correct.
The son smiles whimsically on two occasions when he's looking at another young male character.
The pub scene when Wally comes back after the goat race was a hoot to shoot with free beer flowing all day.
The film copped some flack when it came out, but I think most of that was tied up with the very bad rap most Australian comedies got in 2003.
There was also a bit of controversy when the film was chosen to open the Sydney Film Festival (a pretty snooty affair usually reserved for 'arthouse movies').
(If you keep this in mind as you view the piece it will be easier to find other clues and make sense of the myriad allusions to anatomical development, sexual differentiation, and the period of embryonic sexual development - including the period when the outcome is still unknown.
He lost a short battle to keep Tonight to the consummate Leno the same way that Letterman did when Carson left.
However all is not what it seems when Charlie, Emily's violent invisible friend.
Well that's not true, I did guess it, but when you're pointed in every direction then you will end up wondering about every possibility.
The ending though is intense, the final scenes with the girl and the flashing torch really did get to me, it was one of these scenes I'll bring up when I'm asked about the creepiest moments in cinema.
There's a degree of distance about the character De Niro plays, and he seems inaccessible, a problem I feel when he's playing a Father.
They move over to a house by the countryside when De Niro's wife is mysteriously murdered.
The scene turns ugly when Charlie starts killing people.
The special affects where great when victims experience the effects of the drug when shot with a blow gun.
He starts to get worried when she starts to recreate what she saw with her mom in the bathtub blaming him.
Such as why was she not afraid of her father who is the alter ego "Charlie' when her father is her father and also how did going to the country side bring out this alter ego which I'm assuming came about when he killed his wife.
Also, I found some parts of it gross, like when that police officer is in the basement and they show his icky face...o_O Although I rate this movie 8/10, overall I found this film scary yet interesting.
The trailers really made the movie look amazing, but when I saw the movie, I thought, "When is something actually going to happen?"
I found it disappointing that it took a long time for something to happen, and when it finally did, it was a very weak way to finish off a movie.
the whole time i did not throughly pick up on the whole base of the movie as well as the plot until the near end when everything was cleared up.
Look, when I see a creepy little kid, I will say that that kid is a creepy little bastard!
Nevertheless, this is a film best seen when you're young.
It amazes me when people always seek perfection.
I have watched this movie a few times, the first time when it was first released in 1972 and I was barely 4 years old and it has left an indelible mark on me ever since.
Their paths did not cross again until many years later, when he wormed his way back into her life, and took charge of her affairs when she was most vulnerable.
No wonder I hardly noticed the song when I first saw the film.
But this is one of those films in the Thirties when the rich actually put on tuxedos to dress for dinner.
I feel that she is sadly overlooked when the films of the 1930s are discussed.
The best of these is near the end of the film when Joan has to pull off a dinner party for some of John's potential clients without having them know about the mayhem going on behind the scenes, yet she is thwarted quite hilariously at every turn.
Cromwell did wonders with Betty Davis the next year when they did,"Of Human Bondage"...
Wouldn't you think the director would employ the 'letting down' of her hair, when she is 'liberated' by Mr. Young?
Then I thought when the young crippled boy appeared, she would have warm scenes with him.... there were barely any emotion shown towards him, even when she saves his life.
He's surprised when she says yes.
Stephenson is a decent sort (when was he not in most of his films?)
One is the reappearance of one of the wealthy women (Lillian Bond) who thrived with Powell (or seemed to do so) when he was a playboy.
Apparently they had a heavy duty argument at one point, when he agreed to pay off a big clothing bill, a few months after the marriage - he telling her that she better change as he was not rich enough to stand this kind of extravagance.
The bill for her trousseau comes to well over $ 3000 at a time when $ 100 per week was a lot of money for a family of four.
I saw this on TCM a couple of nights ago, and stayed up late to see it a second time when it was screened again later in the evening.
This picture was not available when Ted Turner bought the RKO Pictures catalog.
My mother was growing up when this film came out.
Normally, when you think of RKO in 1933, you think KING KONG or Astaire and Rogers as a team, but there were other good films that might rank just below them in quality and entertainment.
We purchased this movie at a drugstore while on vacation because I remembered watching it a loving it when I was younger.
She blurts out the truth of the marriage trap when Harding refuses to again pay off her debts.
This usually happens when I liked a movie but when there is some aspect that doesn't really fulfill my expectations.
Young Sherlock Holmes was one of the best movies I saw when I was a kid and it amazes me up to this day.London was pictured perfectly by Barry Levinson with the help of course of Stephen Goldblatt (the cinematographer).
when he/she wrote the screenplay?
Thankfully, it got the acclaim it truly deserves when it won both the grand prix and children's jury prize -- a feat never before achieved -- in the 2004 Berlin Film Festival.
Unfortunately, I never got the chance to watch this film in Germany when it won its awards at the Berlin Film Festival in 2004.
I only had the chance to watch it when I came back to the Philippines and I never really expected what impact it would have on me.
Acting - What do you get when you put Lorna Tolentino, Albert Martinez, Gloria Romero, Celia Rodriguez, Mark Gil and (now) Jiro Manio in one great movie?
A kind of humor that moves from intelligent talk to the purely slapstick, but always in a universal way, that everybody can appreciate and enjoy.It's a movie that tries to make you feel how pretty are love and life, and if you let your senses and soul go into the story, when the movie finishes you can feel yourself better than at the beginning.
And when they meet a genius as Hrabal the outcome is excellent.
The children must learn five lessons: 1) Go to bed when you're told 2) Get up when you're told 3) Can't remember 4) Can't remember 5) Do as you're told Overall, if you got kids, take them to this movie.
Out of all the scenes that are featured in this movie, I liked it most when the nanny used her powers to make a donkey dance on two feet.
I assume that the book on which the movie is based provides some background on the character, but curiously the film never does: we never learn a thing about where she came from or where she'll go when she's done with the kids.
The movie has one great line, when Thompson explains to the children, "When you need me but do not want me, then I must stay.
The girls made me promise to buy the DVD when it comes out and we went straight to the book store to get the stories of Nurse Matilda that the movie was based on.
It is rare when it happens but yes, the movie was a FAR sight better than the book.
The children also deserve much praise, especially when you consider most of them are not only very young but had never acted before.
Saw the film this morning at a Sunday Times preview and I'd like to think that more than a few of you will be eating your words when you see the finished product.
I didn't get a chance to watch the whole thing, as I had missed the beginning when it was being shown on SBS.
She was 48 when this film was released.
Debby showed that a girl could still get a gorgeous hunk like Burt even when she was 48!
You guys just can't imagine what us middle aged gals feel when we see Debby and Burt finally doing the wild thing in that living room!
Interestingly enough, when Lancaster was on this film he had just gone through a divorce.
And, if I had been around that area when this film was being made I would have been one of them!
I am one of those who quit watching ER back when it was airing because of all the stars who left.
Miss Kerr was approaching 50 years of age when this movie was made, but was able to been seen close-up and naked with Burt Lancaster in what what must be one of the few (if the only) scenes where Miss Kerr reveals all.
I would remind her of what she said 36 years ago and ask when she would be able to take me to see her agent.
Gino, as an ex con, is forced by French law to take residence anywhere but in a city and so he settles with his young wife in the country, where fate turns against him, as first his wife is killed, then he is hounded by his former crime gang to return to his former lifestyle and also one of the arresting officers from his case years previously, the now chief inspector Goitreau is in charge of the area and has a grudge against him and becomes even more suspicious when he finds out Gino's new girlfriend Lucie is working in the local bank With the help of his now good friend Cazeuenve and his new girlfriend Lucie (Mimsy Farmer) he tries to battle his demons and fight against the troublesome cop.
While inside he penned the script for Le Trou, French slang for prison literally meaning "The Hole", a script that would gain him one of his first steps into the film industry, when it was filmed by Jacques Becker, who turned out one of the best prison films ever made.
So I was high on expectations when i began this film.
He'd have been as stupendous when young.
Instead, I see on the show when the idiot asks for more hot sauce in Mexico there was no please and no thank you, just an assumption and very little effort put in to speak the native language.
This is a great rent when you want to tune in and tune out without having to think to much.
It's a campfire tale not meant for roasting marshmallows; a homespun creation myth rendered by the elder which coincides with the sudden departure of the grandfather as the scene's focal point, when the camera tilts down, then passes slowly across an expanse of fire and grassland.
Although the violinist helps the resistance in an auxiliary capacity, he's a performer first, who succumbs to the lure of a captive audience, as in the scene when the old man puts on an outdoor recital for the laxing soldiers.
Don Plutarco realizes this, after the vanishing act in the cornfield(on his return trip to retrieve the violin), when the captain emerges from the compound with his stolen instrument in the autocrat's clutches.
In the city he scratches a living from busking with the assistance of his son and grandson, but later his instrument offers consolation and catharsis to his fellow-villagers when they are uprooted from their homes by brutal Mexican soldiers in search of rebels harboured in the rural community.
In fact the officer is playing cat and mouse with him, as revealed when the violin disappears from the grandfather's ammunitions hole in the cornfield and reappears in the hands of that officer.
I saw this about 15 years ago when my mother rented it.
And when they start killing each other off over nothing the movie went too far.
I watched this movie with my grandmother when I was about 6 years old.
It is good to see that I am not the only one who was impressed with this obscure film from when HBO was in its infancy (channel 6 anyone?)
I found it to be slow at various points especially when she finally discovers about the stigmata thing and then tries to solve the case.
Then when Dakota and Aubrey meet there was no response from Aubrey.
The story-line is a bit surprising at times, when you don't overthink it.
The big surprise comes later when Aubrey regains conciseness and insists that she's not Aubrey Fleming at all!
Far too confusing to really follow "I Know Who Killed Me" leaves so many loose ends that you feel in trying to understand it's storyline that you'll slip and fall on your head like you would if you forgot to tie your shoelaces when you got dressed in the morning.
Everyone fears a serial killer, particularly when Aubrey disappears.
Everyone thinks she's Aubrey, but when she wakes up, she claims to be a stripper named Dakota Moss.
Of course, I don't know, but my guess is that many of them are reacting to what is happening in Miss Lohan's off-stage life and are piling on with the bile and venom, kicking her when she's down; how chivalrous of them.
The plot, however, is solid enough to carry you entertainingly to that point when everything become clearer.
especially when you consider that I sat through "I Am Legend".
But when she is interviewed by the FBI, she claims that her name is Dakota, and she has no recollection of her attacker...
And she is suffering from this conditioned called "twin stigmata", kinda like the twins on GI Joe (You know, you have to hit one to hurt the other type of thing), which is how I know how to write my only crappy story about her cause deep down inside I know she exists, and that is also the reason that she is randomly losing limbs while she is poll dancing in a strip club where she in the only one who doesn't take off her clothes (of course flashing her hooha to all the paparazzi is totally acceptable, but parish the thought that she flash a teet and get paid for it) is because that when you cut them off my body it falls off of hers.
At the time of it's release, Lindsay was in the media constantly for partying, doing drugs, getting DUI's etc, so when the movie finally hit the screens, most of the public categorised the movie with her personal life - this is unfair.
But when she awakens in the hospital, Aubrey claims to be somebody else... a woman named Dakota Moss, a rough-living stripper who says that she is being mistaken as Aubrey, and that the real Aubrey Fleming is still in mortal danger.
They are always avoided in the movie, and her whole life is unveiled slowly, so that we are led to believe her when she says that the city dumpster was the best thing in her life.
Aside from the occasional, "I almost died laughing when....", I heard scarcely a good comment in the lobby after the film.
I should have guessed when the cashier gave me a funny look while getting my ticket.
I was really looking forward to watch this when it aired during Christmas 2005.
Their lives seems to be like one long running soap opera and of course when it comes to scandals this one takes the biscuit.This program was meant to make the public symphasise with Camilla, but instead really shows her up.
When they first meet they both know that they have something special, but before long when Charles is off in the navy she gets engaged with hardly any thought.
There are bits when Camilla seems to feel sad and cry, but that dosen't match her actions.
You want Diana to run away when she confronts him about her fears of his adultery before the wedding, but you know she isn't going to.
There are factual errors, the most blatant being when Camilla tells Charles Princess Caroline is a prospect and probably still a virgin (this takes place in Fall 1979 when Caroline was married about a year to Philippe Junot).
And the camera shows that: when she talks about herself, the black and white becomes vivid and plain.
Two teenagers called Sandy and Danny spend their summer together and are sad when they have to leave each other.
However, when they realise they are at the same high school, things take a turn for the best - or for the WORST..?
While it had fun dance music and hits (although I am usually not a Bee Gees fan, even when I was younger) with several famous and soon to be famous actors, the reason I give it a 7 versus something higher is that it gets a little too serious regarding Sandra and Danny (inconsistent with the rest of the movie, even the possible pregnancy is taken less seriously) and it did not keep true to the original musical.
It to me is more nostalgic of the 1970's and the actors who became the stars later on and the music that I heard when I was a kid.
I used to watch it every week when I was at school and even now it's as much fun as it always was.
Grease was the first movie that I saw when I was a kid that caused me to go back and see it again and again.
On the one hand, it's easy for me to watch it so many times because it's a musical and when you find the tunes catchy you can't resist it.
I loved this movie, it was really good and seemed to take me back in time to that time when guys wore leather jackets and greased back their hair.
  I think I laughed once at this film, watched it when I was ten or eleven, because it has a scene where one dog humps another.
This is one of a number of movies I saw back when they were first released, misguidedly enjoyed at the time, and now find I have major issues with.
Grease is not just a 70's fancy musical, it is a symbol to an era, an era when you could make a musical that had enough character to be great.
I met the girl of my dreams when I took her on a date to see the play, so this film has a special place in my heart.
I hated this movie when I was a teenager and I'm so pissed at myself because of that.
It's funny because I liked "Saturday Night Fever" better when I was younger but now I don't care for that movie and the exact opposite happened with this one...go figure.
Final Synopsis:  Movies : I did see this when I was in high school because it was re-released in the late 90's in theaters but stupid macho me back then didn't care for it.
Caine and Moore must cringe when they ever stumble on this!
These movies give the appearance of fact, when all they are is a thinly-disguised judgement.
Arjun and Ganga befriend each other, but the real trouble starts when Ganga is taken to LA to live with Kishorilal's huge NRI family before marriage.
I don't think Ghai tried to show NRIs in a bad light, because such differences and difficulties are to be expected in any kind of transition from one country to another, particularly when moving from a conservative and traditionalistic society like that of India to a liberal country like USA.
There were many great and touching moments in the film, my favourite being when Ganga talks to her father in India on the phone and feels very lonely and sad.
"FrÃ¼hling auf dem Eis" shows a large number of well known Austrian actors and the ensemble of the Vienna Ice Revue, world-famous at a time when I was young.
In 1947 when my mother probably already was the best European skater and at least the second best in the world, Austrian skaters were not admitted to the European and the World competitions.
In her teens she would get up at 4 am daily to run to the Vienna ice rink (Wiener Eislaufverein) to practice her school figures before school -- and this at a time when Austrian skaters could practice only in the cold season as there were no indoor skating halls as there were in the US and Canada.
I remember to have seen her in the programme of the Vienna Ice Revue in Brussels in 1961 when I was 5 years old.
In "FrÃ¼hling auf dem Eis" I saw her again when I was about twenty years old in a retrospective on TV.
"FrÃ¼hling auf dem Eis" shows a large number of well known Austrian actors and the ensemble of the Vienna Ice Revue, world-famous at a time when I was young.
I'm not saying that ad-libbing and straying from the plot isn't standard fare for comedians, but when the whole show is like this, when the "mistakes" are so deliberate, it becomes patronising.
And when Woodley just ignores him and puts the fire extinguisher on various parts of Colin's body, going, "I'm going to freeze your back-knees, and then I'm going to freeze your right eye, so when you walk down the street, everyone will look at you and say 'oh, look at him.
Anyone who has seen this show will know what I say when I say, I loved the stage hand Clem.
AND, when Woodley says, "Oh, I was just worried you'd fall off the stage and land on your cock."
My absolute favorite bit though, is when, at the very end, they are in Heaven and on wires and spinning around.
I loved the part where Frank ask's the neighbour to feed their cat when they were away, only to come back to the neighbour, moment's later, to tell her that they don't have a cat.
Sometimes, he's very good, but when he's bad, he's really boring.
so these two impulses - towards psychological truth and towards a mystery story which necessarily precludes the audience having any access to the character's psychology, puts it with the same level of knowledge of characters as the other characters, making for an effectively tense film, which, beyond its mystery trappings, asks whether we can ever know anyone, when trust, or self-confidence, or faith in 'reality' is gone.
At once a subtle play on the nature of lies, floating the notion that when everybody's lying there are no more lies, and another of his portraits of small town petit bourgeois suspicion ("You never really know who you live with.
I'll be interested to pick this one up when the U.S. release hits to see if the storyline measures up to my expectations...8/10
While traveling by train, Kim recalls an incident two years ago in their last year in school, when they had been abused by their couch and lover of Panor when they found their affair.
Once in the village, they spend the night with Ta and his stepmother Panor in their isolated house in the jungle nearby a river, when creepy things happen and their horror begin.
The story is really scary, and has some nasty and cruel scenes: the worst is the sequence when the teenager is tortured with hot water and burned by a torch.
I think it's something about the Jack Benny persona, a sort of benign pompousness that audiences enjoy seeing deflated, even when he's the 'good guy'.
Regarding the storyline,I'm not writing to spoon feed anyone;you can read it for yourselves but I am stating that when it next pops up on Turner,take a peek.
Why, I don't know, but it's no doubt good to relax with when the presents are unwrapped--or any other time of year.
I found it more amusing this time than when I originally had seen it.
To appreciate it you have to remember two things - firstly, it was made in 1942, and thus there are quite a few patriotic themes in the movie, since that was the kind of film being made at the beginning of World War II, when the U.S. didn't yet know if it would be successful fighting a two front war in which everything was at stake.
He did this deliberately, because Jack had insisted Kilbride play the part when Jack Warner just wanted to insert one of his contract players.
Jack Benny got his way, but every time Jack Benny looked at Percy Kilbride when he was shooting the movie he broke into hysterical laughter.
This film takes advantage of Benny's comic timing and deadpan delivery of comic observations when confronted by outrageous behavior and situations on all sides, but it is just not a role for a cheapskate.
Benny was most popular when he played himself in roles tailored to his talents, but although this role is a bit atypical his talents are well suited to the constantly harried Bill Fuller--and he has remarkable rapport with co-star Ann Sheridan, an underestimated actress who shows tremendous flair for comedy as his determinedly optimistic wife.
I was really moved when he tries to put a contract on himself, oh that sense of sadness and despair.
when he lets a poor old lady not to pay the full price for whatever she was buying).
Katie O'Neill (Susan Hayward) first meet Paul Van Riebeck (Tyrone Power), a leader of the South African Boers, when he comes to Ireland on a horse-buying trip...
Her quest takes her to Los Angeles, a city that proves to be not too friendly to Esperanza, but in which she ends up finding love when she meets a wrestling star that falls in love with her.
"Santitos" made quite an impression when it was presented at the Sundance Film Festival.
Hot Bubblegum - as it was titled when I saw it - is in the line of "Porky's", "American Pie", "Revenge of the Nerds" ... but it just seems to beat all of them.
If I had to see stuff like this when I went to the movies I might have tried to tunnel out of the country too!
Again it doesn't help when it's all about superman, if DC wants to expand with their media then they have to do more, not just focus on lesser characters but give those the characters the decent animation drawings, plot and script they need.
It's quite laughable and sometimes even ludicrous when seemingly uneducated, or at the very least, unknowing and uncultured individuals write a comment that is nothing more than trite, shallow, insubstantial, and crude in the hopes that they will sound intelligent or even worth reading.
The story of the Legion of Superheroes also gives an insight into the sheer heroism of Superman Prime back when he was still quite heroic and not tainted with the insanity that made him into an intergalactic scourge.
Wincott delivered some great fighting and action in movies like "Martial Law 2", "Mission of Justice", "Deadly Bet" and even "Martial Outlaw", and that means that I got really disappointed when it turned out that this film sucked to the extreme on that level.
Dr.Ann Kendall (Terri Hawkes) is the last one of Wincott's list but he finds himself falling for his prey and when the time comes for the kill, Quinn ends up protecting Kendall from the assassins now gunning for them both in this intense thriller.
This is a sort of strange epic spectacular film of a time when the genre was not in high demand.
The more than 20 years elapsed between both films shows clearly the different cinematographic techniques of one time and the other; but both products have many similarities in their conception such as the crash between two completely different civilizations each one with their own religious, social and political standards and also the search of gold and riches by both "conquistadores" and their total lack of scruples for the achievement of their target (clearly leaving aside the pretended conversion to Catholicism of the natives that was the excuse of their kings to support the expeditions in a time when the church ruled in Spain).
The atmosphere that not very prolific director Irving Lerner obtains in his film is excellent transiting a sort of a mystical sensation at times and when required; the final sequence when the Incas are waiting for Atahualpa's Sun-father to raise and bring him back to life is outstanding.
Well maybe some of them do..., but when They have to choose...
This is a great animated feature film.It was so cool to see He-Man and She-Ra and Skeletor and Hordak together!I loved it when He-Man and She-Ra did their transformation after each other near then!
Secret of The Sword with He-Man and She-ra is one of my favorite children's movies when I was a kid!
In fact I still remember when I saw it and where I saw it!
Since 85, when I was only 11 years old, i have been watched every type of movies.
My favorite part is when He Man gets captured by Hordak and is chained up in Hordak's castle.
I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy the magic of the cartoons they remember from when they were kids.
By Phil Villarreal Arizona Daily Star  One of the resounding proofs of my mother's love was seared into my brain on Saturday, March 23, 1985, when she took me to see "The Secret of the Sword," succumbing to my relentless begging the day after the film opened.
The animated film hooked me from the opening frame, when the monster ballad theme song "I Have the Power" blared over the speakers.
"I never knew I had a brother, but when a woman in a sword told me so, I knew it was true," She-Ra deadpans.
The script is straight from the pioneering 1953 TV series, when spying on earth from a satellite was a futuristic idea, and travelling in a spacecraft 500,000 miles from Earth was a step into the unknown.
I was seven when I first watched this movie and am still captivated by it as a 26 year-old.
And he soon meets Adora, who just might be the owner of the magic sword...  Back then, when I was a kid, I was very fond of the "He-man and the masters of the universe" show and it's "sequel" "She-ra".
Mostly when it plays back in He-man's world( why in the world would He-man and She-ra just leave Skeletor in Snake mountain after they defeated him?!
I remember seeing this movie when I was about 4 years old and let me tell you that it was great.
It was one of the most fantastic animated adventure made when I was a child.
When the movie came out, pre-multiplex, kids of all ages rejoiced when Adora 'held aloft her magic sword and said, "For The Honor of Greyskull!"
Mixing the original He-Man series with She-Ra was done effectively, meaning it was a buyable story-line... and when all was said and done, and Adora, nay She-Ra, realized her true identity, she decided to stay and "defend Etheria against the evil forces of Hordak."
Pure cheese, but when you're a kid, who cares?
And for a high school student just researching the realm of mythical and fantastic literature, this movie was addictive when it first came out.
The vision of the movie is fluid and only gets slow at certain points, which is totally understandable when considering the task of trying to fit in the whole Authorian legend into one movie.
Thankfully, the scenes are erotic and beautifully filmed in stark contrast to the dark and grim life these people lead when not killing.
He tells the stories of Uther, Merlin, Arthur, Mordred, Morgana, Perceval, Lancelot, and Guenevere, when a single story about any one of them could make up a 90 minute movie.
Carl Orff was a good choice as well), some beautiful cinematography and sets (some scenes almost take my breath away, like when The Sword is thrown into the water), imagination (I've never seen intercourse in full armor before), and a great story.
I found the acting flat, the special effects non-existent (if you want to leave it to the imagination of the viewer-do radio) and the script ludicrous (example reaction to man in lab when apparent tramp wanders in)
I felt a strange elation when Arthur drew the sword, one of the most meaningful and defining moments in literary, and now movie, history.
I trembled and rejoiced when Arthur handed Excalibur to Uriens and was knighted.
And my eyes welled up with tears when the ship took his body away to Avalon  And the music... That glorious music, never intrusive, but always suggestive and underlining the drama subtly.
Furthermore, much of the myth surrounding King Arthur that many are familiar with comes from a work published in 1485 (Thomas Mallory's Le Mort D'Arthur), a time when armor design was at its zenith and plate armor was common amongst those who could afford it, i.e.
I was not in the least bothered by the depiction of Arthur and his knights in full plate armor when engaged in battle.
She was only a small child (played by Barbara Byrne) when she witnessed the rape of her mother Igrayne (played by Boormans' daughter Katrine) by Uther.
Another is the strange rhetoric that Arthur and the land are one, and when Arthur becomes ill, the land of his kingdom becomes barren.
If the scenes when the knights go riding through countryside with their pennants flying behind them doesn't give you the shivers, this is not and will never be your kind of movie.
But when Morgana pronounces "love", one would expect Merlin to answer "hate", but he just says: "O yes."
When she steals the "charm of making" from Merlin, Morgana gets stronger... We feared her lines when she affirmed: "I can ease your loneliness."
He dreams of a fight with himself... And when he wakes up naked, he sees his own sword stuck in his side...
I can remember that when it came out, a film magazine reviewed it twice, feeling that it had to do so, since its two reviewers had such contrasting opinions.
I remember how suddenly I found myself immersed in this world when I first saw the film, and even now the hairs stand up on the back of my neck thinking about it.
He's sharp, but often is the comedy relief character when it comes to Lupin.
He always leaves notes saying when and what he's going to steal.
But I have some goofs I would like to report, in the scene where she is putting her groceries away in the fridge, we see her pull out 1,2,3 vitamin waters and stick them all in the same place but when the camera backs up, there is only 2 vitamin waters.
Another goof is when in her vision when she is the only one alive, she is driving home but in the background you see a gold car parked in the street.
I got about 45 minutes into it when I realized that I had to go to work.
In 50 or 60 years, when many of us were dead, someone will watch this movie and he will say: "IT'S WONDERFUL... WHY PEOPLE DIDN'T APPRECIATE IT?"
I got REALLY excited when I saw this movie in a Blockbuster one day.
Her problem was originated when her husband cheated her with the nanny of their children, breaking her confidence on him.
This situation is very clear when Randy tells that she cannot forget and forgive him, after the incident with the police.
We watch Columbo or Monk intensely because we hope that in the end it will all come together; when it simply does not, we are robbed.
I kept watching it to try to figure out just what was going on, and was so disappointed and confused when they revealed the ending.
Is this all just a dream and Suzanne Plechette is lying next to us when we open our eyes?
I thought it would be as well (based off of the DVD case description) and I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was wrong about that when the final credits rolled.
'Danika' is not terribly bad, but frankly, I was utterly disappointed when the good atmosphere and the few achievements were suddenly overshadowed by the silly ending.
A mixture of critical pieces of disastrous events flash before Danika's eyes as well as flashbacks to some years back when her children were young.
The characters in the movie have no idea when this bomb is going to go off.
They also have no idea when Jack is going to fly into a rage or have another flashback.
It's a tale of a dysfunctional family in the 1950's when it was uncommon for the public to see the truth behind closed doors.
More importantly, though, Rose makes the viewer aware that at a time when the U.S. military was developing weapons powerful enough to devastate any foe, some children were feeling nearly powerless in their own homes in the face of real threats to their safety.
The story is set in the '50's, at a time when the U.S. is testing nuclear weapons at a base north of Las Vegas.
That other time wasn't till the next year when I picked up the game around 2004 and played it I figured out what to do and spent months training up playing the game.
The main characters own special powers according to their type (for example the earth guy has powers related to earth and so on) which are necessary when you need to solve puzzles to beat the many different dungeons.
i think people should really watch this film and come to an understanding that NO one can tell some one else who what why and when to love - cause it's a free right - no one is entitled to take from another person.
I can't recall when I have ever been so moved by a film.
There is simply not enough time to really go into the characters or the plot, and when the movie was finished, I was wanting more.
The characters are captivating and at the end of the ambush, when Yossi finally admits his love, I was crying.
The relationships which they form is beautiful and it's only when something tragic happens, Jagger is about to die, that Yossi expresses all his feelings for him.
The scene in the snow is thus not only the victory of joy and will to live over war (because we aren't allowed to forget these guys are in a war area), but also the liberation one feels when one is finally allowed to express feelings forbidden by society.
I hope that when they re-make "Quatermass 2", they give it a *slightly* bigger budget.
Specially in the last few minutes, when Yossi was watching Lior's photo in which he was dressed as a bunny rabbit, he suddenly shocked by something, Lior told him about the picture the day he died.
At first I couldn't understand his smile when looking at the picture of his dead lover.
Watching a film like this oddly makes you feel as good as when you watched 'Amelie'!
Even near the end when there is a "Hollywood" type moment between the two protagonists during a military ambush, the film returns to the truth with its ending that shows that not everything is about Hollywood happy endings.
I fell  off my seat when I heard it.
Which, of course, is normal for young people in their early twenties... and more so when they are in the front lines and could die at any moment.
They shouldn't be spending so much energy when they might need it in the next few hours, but they can't help it.
This moment in the film shows so well how lonely life can be for gay lovers... especially when one dies.
Unfortunately for their love, it is torn from them when Jagger is killed during a night skirmish.
I respect Yossi for coming to grips at the end when they all go to visit Jagger's family and Yossi is the only one that knows the most about his love-Jagger.
The other is his companion and secret lover Yossi who despite command responsibilities, yearns for a time when he and Jagger can openly express their love.
Strong pain in heart when that sad mother (Mrs Amichai) says " people don't have time to know each other...I don't even know my son favorite song..."  Commandant Yossi, not the beautiful soldier Yaeli ,answer: "BO, from Rita".
Strong pain in heart when he sees Lior picture as a rabbit... A movie FROM HEART , in a so terrible time , in Golan mountains.
It's stunning Â you wouldn't guess they're a couple because they learned to hide it very well, but when they are alone you get a hint at how much they love each other.
There's a now-famous scene, early in the movie, when Yossi and Jagger make love in the snow (don't get excited - all you see are some lingering kisses and the aftermath, in which the two characters are entirely at ease with one another, free from the restraints imposed by Army discipline), but their romance takes up a surprisingly small amount of the movie's running time, which appears to have been curtailed for reasons of length (there's a number of images doing the rounds from scenes which were apparently shot but didn't make it to the final print).
But within a running time less than an animated film, this movie delivers a complete story with genuine feelings, touches many grounds, and manages to be moving and leaves your heart ache by the time when end credit rolls.
There are very few belly laughs - one I remember was when the protagonist Eric Linden says to his not-so-clever girl (Cecilia Parker) "I was born 100 years before my time" and she responds "I was born 10 days before mine."
But I was particularly impressed with Helen Flint playing the vamp who Linden gets involved with when he was drowning his sorrows.
But it has some terrific moments, as towards the end when Nat warns Dick about fallen women/prostitutes as "sepulchres".
The scene of the 4th of July morning, when all the young boys come out with their firecrackers never fails to put me on the floor laughing.
Perhaps the best film ever made, 'Sunset Blvd' follows the story of lonely and struggling writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) who is thrown into a web of romance and feuds with aging silent actress Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her creepy butler Max Von Mayerling (Erich Von Stroheim) when he accidentally stumbles across Norma's mansion when he uses her garage for his car so it doesn't get taken.
This movie was made back in the day when Hollywood produced incredible movies with incredible story lines.
He goes through the forms of saying he doesn't want Norma's gifts, but he takes them, claims to be surprised on New Year's Eve when she throws a party just for the two of them, but surely he has known from the first that she wants not only a writer, but a young man to reassure her that she is still attractive.
Wilder creates an exceedingly absorbing effect here, because when he escapes to see his old pal Jack Webb, and tension grows between him and Betty, Norma's world sure has gotten stuffy by that time and we feel a great deal of solace from her twisted realm.
But then again, classics only get that designation when further times arrive.
The obsession with the car is witty and when he first appears on screen in dealing with the finance agents is cool and collected deceitful, establishing the character's core exceptionally well.
The prevailing interpretation of SUNSET BOULEVARD assumes that Norma is one of Hollywood's victims; that the town and the industry turned its back on her when she was no longer a star, her career sabotaged by the coming of sound in motion pictures.
But apparently, it didn't matter to her: she dabbled in acting now and again, when the part amused her, but she had better things to do with her life.
No wonder Louis B. Mayer went wild, when he saw the film.
But this is Swansons show, she keeps the small balance between madness and a sane mind until the end, when she finally slips into madness.
Spiritual and emotional emptiness, and the price of fame, greed, narcissism, and ambition is at the heart of this devilishly stylistic film, with the somber mood beginning almost immediately when a dead man is found floating facedown in a swimming pool.
Betty is gradually falling in love with Joe, but when Norma finds out, that he's been sneaking out to meet wit her, all hell breaks loose.
There's also the hilarious appearance of a skinny and madly grinning Jack Webb as a happy-go-lucky assistant director, and viewers will get a kick out of the excessive exuberance that Norma displays when she towels down a hunky and hairy-chested Joe at poolside.
The funniest scene in the movie is when Norma rolls on top of Joe while he is reclining on a couch, and then does an imitation of Charlie Chaplin in order to cheer him up; the scene is an uproarious mixture of the sad, the funny, and the pathetic.
A broke screenwriter, down on his luck and desperate to take on any job, he stumbles upon what looks like a deserted mansion, when he's hounded by some creditors.
It shows what Hollywood does to people like Norma--it makes them stars, tells them that they're great and dump them coldly when they're no longer needed.
Everybody thought this was a bad idea when it was being made.
You see the pity, anger and helplessness on his face when he realizes Norma is falling in love with him--and he's trapped.
On my first viewing, I wasn't particularly impressed with this movie but I liked it a lot more on the second and by the third - when it's magnificently transferred on DVD - I was fan, too.
This is a good visual film, particularly when it shows the inside of this incredible mansion where a lot of the scenes take place.
That is why, when he commits suicide, Vicki goes into seclusion.
Supposedly when Von Stroheim was being directed by Billy Wilder he wanted to throw in various tics and sexual habits for Max (like his carefully washing Norma's underclothes) which Wilder managed to push aside.
Finally, the entire sequence when Holden returns to find Swanson phoning Betty Shaefer to tell her the truth about Joe Gillis, Swanson is in cold-cream and "wings" to smooth her cheeks and eyes -- an actress completely exposed and without vanity.
Even more so when, after intermission, the second act began with her character giving a Q&A session at the local Rotary Club.
Swanson walked down steps and into the actual audience, greeting "old friends" (that night's audience members), reminiscing about her career -- even sitting in a man's lap and "teasing" him for not remembering when they "dated" -- as real film clips from her silents played on a giant screen onstage.
I was in first grade when "Sunset Boulevard" was released.
I was in my 20s when I saw Swanson onstage in "Reprise" in Hollywood.
I know the film well, & was intrigued when I heard about this version & how it would compare.
"Sunset Boulevard" is a bitter and tragic masterpiece of the genius Billy Wilder that exposes how Hollywood uses people and forgets them when they get old and are considered decadent by the industry.
It's interesting to watch the film during different times in one's life Â when I was a child watching this film, I thought the story was good and that Norma Desmond (Swanson) was a pretty scary lady.
Now, in my late 20's and early 30's I found it to have a different impact on me Â I was saddened by Desmond's mental illness, and when she makes her final descent down her staircase and utters her famous line as the camera pans the faces of the people around her, so full of pity, and the care her butler/ex-husband takes to make sure she's happy for maybe the last time in her life made more of an impact on me than any other time in the 20-odd times I've seen this film.
I don't think this film could have had that same effect when it debuted and maybe this added dimension holds so much more appeal for today's audiences.
The series had a special look when it came, very dark, nearly entirely humorless and very brooding characters.
Although the critics may have been wishy-washy when reviewing this film, I had only one word going through my mind while watching it: brilliant.
Even now, recalling the mobsters 'flying' through the air when being shot in the beginning brings a smile to my lips.
He plays the part only moderately well, certainly not as well as would be expected when compared to some of his better movies, but nothing to complain about.
The plot is tight, but I will say that the love interest (Sandra Bullock, who he meets when he visits for an enema) could have been completely taken out of the movie and it would not have lost anything.
He falls in love when he least expects it, finds friends in a very unlikely group, and manages to keep going despite the circumstances.
The original BBC version of THE QUATERMASS EXPERIMENT shocked a nation way back in 1953 but this remake barely caused a ripple when broadcast three years ago and it's not too difficult to see why .
It's similar to watching a whodunnit unfold when you already know who did it so there's no surprises .
Kudos for that, no doubt, belong to the director (who also wrote it), who assembled a remarkably colorful group of actors and fashioned one of the funniest ensemble performances I've ever seen on the screen, a comedy that unfolds with a paradoxically poetic visual style that keeps you howling even when the actors aren't speaking.
I did not know what to expect when I started looking.
Even Sandra Bullock is amusing, especially when giving a colonic.
MANY men keep that part of themselves hidden in a homophobic world, especially when your father is one of the heads of the Colombian Cartel.
This is an honest, funny view of what happens when Liam Neeson's character, a former DEA golden-boy, starts getting job-related panic attacks... Add Oliver Platt as a high-strung gangster with marital problems, Jose Zuniga as a secretly-homosexual drug lord, and group therapy, and the result is GUNSHY, a smart, wicked, sweet, fast, and funny look at the modern gangster flick.
The show only came to life at the very end when she did all her songs from "Cabaret" (No "New York, New York"--that was 3 years later).
I can express with great certainty that the editing could have been better as often there are instances when the screen goes dark for several seconds in between scenes, leaving the audience wondering what's next.
But then again, one can hardly blame them when they're being forced to say the most ridiculous lines in the history of people talking to each other.
The story of this film takes place in 1972, when the sexual revolution was in full-swing in suburbia.
Especially after her husband threatens to walk out on her, when he gets fed-up with Viva's excessive sexual shenanigans.
But it's always there, waiting to shine starkly when the waters are still at last.
I think that it is such a rare thing when the whole 'directed by, produced, written, costumed and starring..' gimmick works and it only works when that person can act AND write (in my opinion she couldn't do either).
It attempts to satire late 1960's,early 1970's soft core pre-porn films (when they had wall to wall female nudity,but no actual graphic/explicit sexual intercourse depicted on screen).
I watched this with some friends and there were times when we had to actually stop the DVD because we were laughing so hard!
3/10  FOURTH MATCH- SEAN 'O' HAIRE W/ ROWDY RODDY PIPER VS. RIKISHI Not a bad brawl from these two men but when did Sean 'O' Haire & Roddy Piper form an alliance together.
The Rock/Goldberg match was probably the best of the night it took ages for them to start but when they did it was a very intense match.
This was a period when story telling was paramount, and movies unfolded gently, with a respect for both real and theatrical time.
It cares about the last short period of Scottish poet Gowan Mc Land`s life.He had a dismissal from a professorship of poetry and now unfortunately is condemned to earn money with celebrating his artwork in clubs of interested housewives, New England.The housewives, which are shown there, don`t have real ambitions with artistry or poetry;they hope it could be entertaining to watch a person, whose only purpose is to make weird things like poems.This becomes very clear at the end of one of Gowan`s public readings;no one in the audience becomes aware when the performance is over, except the artist himself;he has to give his "fans" permission to applause.
That`s a main subjekt here.The span beetween Gowan`s art and the demandings of ordinary life are heavy to handle for him.But,God almighty, suddenly,at a point,an artist can be overwhelmed by the power of profanity ;when falling in love with a beautiful young student-Geneva.
Frederick Knott wrote Dial as a play in the early fifties and the Hitchcock film version was released in 1954 BUT the entire plot (our old friend the 'perfect' murder) hinged on the fact that in those days only the upper and middle classes had telephones at all and those were in fixed locations and in this era of jack points and cell phones the idea of someone obliged to answer a telephone located on a desk in front of heavy drapes behind which a murderer was lurking ready to strike when the phone was answered would be ludicrous.
And yes, there were certain brief moments when she looked (rather than sounded) like her mother, but she's all LIZA.
I saw her on Broadway in CHICAGO in 1975, and caught her first "Post-Betty Ford Center" tour in 1985, and she was still brilliant (That's when she starting singing "When I gooooooooooooo - I'm NOT - going - like - El - sie!")
The movie made up of sketches ,as I said, has always been Duvivier's forte.Here ,there are seven flashbacks,one prologue and one short epilogue :strange how this final resembles that of Mitchell Leisen's "to each his own" (1942),when the boy says to Olivia De Havilland:"I think it's our dance mother".Having directed with a topflight cast "tales of Manhattan" (1942) in America,Duvivier went even further in the "sketches movie":in "sous le ciel de Paris" ,he used intertwined little stories till all these subplots became a seamless whole.
At one point, the scenes in Mordor get so far ahead of those in Gondor that they had to add narration at Mount Doom saying "Sam searched for Frodo for days..." when the subsequent events took place only seconds later.
I hated the opening sequence at rivendell then the flashback to the story which didn't even start when 'The Lord of the Rings' ended and that was why the movie was made so it could finish the story.
We have really come a long way in terms of visual storytelling and the types of shows that get produced on television, but when I was watching it, the one thing that stuck out was Bob Fosse's choreography.
On another note, I think you get a somewhat good glimpse of the 70s when you watch this show.
Unfortunately Bahksi did exactly half of the story, so when the return of the king continues with the last, third part, some of the most important pieces of the story are missing.
I have to say than when I pictured Orcs, they did not dance and sing a song called, "where there's a whip there's a way".
People shouldn't even listen to it when they read the book.
I will ignore the obviously superior films by Peter Jackson when evaluating this low-budget cartoon.
(even if it got worse here when the skeletor-nazguls showed up) Still, The Hobbit (1977) worked in my mind (I gave it an 8 vote here), Glenn's songs were great there, the voices were very good, the story was a children's story, my 4-yr old girl loves it (I saw it for the first time just a month ago).
Having said that, the film works best when it deviates from the original story, as with the singing orcs and the dream sequence with the waving orcs or when Sam conquers Mordor.
His version was perhaps too ambitious, and when the money ran out they had to cut short the process and the resulting film is not what Bakshi planned nor what fans wanted.
My only real complaint here is that (spoiler here) Frodo puts on the Ring halfway through the story, when Theoden dies.
when?
And when he returns to his household and family "Do you love me?"
The lovers secretly meet in an upper room in a hotel...the so-called blue room...usually on a Thursday when the coast is clear.
I'm sure when this film was made in 1934, it was considered a breakthrough and sympathetic.
A fortune is made on Delilah's recipe and when Delilah is asked to sign for 20% of the proceeds that her recipe created she states that money is not important to her, but, she would like enough money set aside so she can have a grand funeral, "I loves me a good funeral."
(spoiler) Bea basically steals Delilah's pancake recipe, uses her image to sell pancakes, and makes a load of moolah, while Delilah, like a good slave, doesn't mind and turns down a cut when offered.
She is simpleminded, seems to be able to function only in a relationship of dependency, as is illustrated when she turns down Miss Bea's offer of a 20% stake in a multi- million dollar business that was based on her pancake recipe because she wants to stay a housekeeper.
A moment earlier on in the movie is particularly offensive when she is asked to hold a goggle eyed, smiling "darkie" pose to model the sign for the pancake business.
What was Universal thinking when they wasted their time and budget on this waste of film?
Louise as Delilah, though she had a difficult and groundbreaking role to play in Hollywood history, when compared to one that may be as difficult if not more so as Hattie McDaniel in GWTW, she pales shamefully in comparison and her abilities as an actor (if any) simply don't come across.
The movie skips ahead years later when Beavers' daughter (Fredi Washington) is trying to pass herself off as white...and things go out of control.
Later, when Beavers is getting rich, she refuses to get her own house and insists on staying with Colbert--living in the basement no less!
I will say this though: I've heard that most guys, when they grow up, fall for women similar to their mothers.
Stan Musial when he was making big money as a baseball star had a mother who took in washing back in the little steel mill town of Donora, Pennsylvania where he came from and not because he wasn't willing to provide.
And there are those stubbornly over-committed to a work ethic when they don't have to be.
I saw this for the first time on TV when I was a child.
Halston's costumes were gorgeous and even when he put her in knickers (which believe it or not were IN for about 5 minutes during this time) she still doesn't look dated-you just think "Wow, I didn't remember KNICKERS looking that amazing"!
It does hurt me to see her turn against and deny her mother as the movie ends, but when her mother then dies, it's even more sorrowful that Peola never has the chance to tell her, "Yes I did love you and I should have claimed you as my mother from the start" For anyone who loves a warm, heartfelt classic, you should certainly see Imitation of life (The year 1934)
But in the real world, how frequently did white and black people cooperate that closely when millions of dollars were at stake?
My mother, who was a child when this came out, used to talk about seeing this several times and crying each time.
At the beginning of this version, do you remember Delilah's response when Bea asks why she hadn't taken the streetcar?
There was probably some "imitation of life" to the movie when it was made, no matter how silly or stereotypical it might have been, even for its time.
Yes, the 20/80 split when the pan cake business went incorporated might seem unfair now, but it was better than the 1950's film where Annie just waits on Ms. Lora, dolling out wisdom with a spoon full of sugar.
Liza may never be as fit as she was when she performed on stage in a live production in 1972.
However, when it works, it really works!
Granted, he grew up during the sexually repressed '50s, so when sex became an acceptable topic in movies, he was ready to show it.
But in terms of experimenting with form, it is one of the very best that Woody has come up with, at a time when he was making his "early, funny movies".
The highlights for me include the climactic (err, maybe pun intended) end sequence showing the inner workings (with Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds present in the control room) of intercourse; the faux game show involving sexual questions (and yes, that is Regis Philbin) with a truly belly-laugh of a finale involving a Jewish mother; best is the Gene Wilder sheep scene, which was my favorite when I first saw the film as a kid.
Interestingly enough, even when there are segments that aren't as funny as the others (the sci-fi spoof with the giant boob, or the opening segment sent in medieval times), it does become a little more humorous in future viewings.
Or, at the least, have wondered what it's like when Wilder puts S&M garb on a sheep, it's worth a viewing (some of his dialog with the sheep is a killer every single time I see it).
I sneaked into this R rated film when I was 13 thinking this film was something it was not.
Catch Woody when he was funny.
i was lucky enough to have seen the show when it was originally broadcast.
Yet in its juvenile way, there is something almost innocently naughty about the movie that makes it almost quaint -- especially when compared to today's standards of vulgarity.
As such EVERYTHING YOU HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX* is something of a period piece, reflecting a time when being outrageously tasteless was something unique and not something tiresomely routine.
I think it would had made the movie all the more incoherent when Allen would had played the main lead in all of the different segments.
THE POSITIVE: This was made when Allen was at his absolute peak.
It's finally captured when Allen lures it into a giant brassiere.
There is no question that when funny the film is at Allen's most memorably zany and inspired: his homage to Italian film-making, dealing with exhibitionism is hilarious and effortlessly stylish, a send up of campy science fiction showing a giant breast rampaging the countryside is gleefully hysterical madness, and his legendary final sketch, detailing the inner workings of the brain and sperm during sexual intercourse is a masterpiece of comedic cunning and genius.
Nonetheless, it remains a testament to Allen as a director that even with such a potentially disastrous cinematic undertaking, even when severely flawed, such a daring undertaking remains irrepressibly enjoyable and memorable - it is just a shame that enjoyable is as far as the film reaches, considering the comedic depth and psychological resonance a more confident, present Allen could have mined from the subject matter.
Still, Allen's mark is all over the skits, even when he isn't in them.
In the films that followed "Annie Hall" he seemed to be trying to be Bergman at times and Fellini at others, when I always thought he was better just being Woody.
I wonder if David Reuben realized that Woody was actually mocking his book when he sold the rights.
Even when you were at the top of your game, doing things like 21 Jump Street, no one would have called you a genius.
It makes you wonder, when Stephen Cannell came up with the title "Dead Above Ground", was he describing himself?
I "heard" a lot of the same comments when "Evil Dead" first hit the scene, but they were smaller in volume due to the inability of a--holes to be able to post their remarks everywhere!
That's when the killing begins.
I will never understand why two people must physically try to beat each other up when one is a cop (with a gun) and the other has a big ax.
i think some the actors was high when making this movie.
I will just assume it is in Orange County, because that makes me feel a little less disturbed when teenagers die.
This is totally irrelevant until the last few minutes of the movie, when weaker souls will have already walked out.
For instance, when the coach dies (which is cool by the way because the coach is an ass clown), the killer tapes up a picture of Mr. Hadden.
The very best part of this movie was when I remembered that I had some juice in the fridge and I went up and got it.
Some events in the movie are just odd, like when a grenadelauncher, or some sort of big mega gun is thrown in the water and floats ashore.
To be fair it doesn't try to hide it's 'influences', but when they are performed so badly it's hard to forgive.
DNA rip-offs so many movies... First there is the beginning when you think this is going to be an Indiana Jones rip-off... Then you get the feeling that you are watching a rip-off of Jurassic Park, but near the end it becomes a total rip-off of Predator.
But near the end when the helicopter crashes, the effects are probably the worst you have ever seen.
Story plot: At a small border-post on the Yugoslav-Albanian border, yet another generation of soldiers suffering the usual amount of boredom awaits the end of their service, counting days to the moment when they should take their uniforms off for good.
(In "Karaula" they're, of course, led by a wise-crackin' Belgrade bad boy and his constantly smiling Dalmatian tag-along buddy - all of which seems lifted straight from that 'Bolji zivot' episode when Boba (Dragan Bjelogrlic) goes to the army and is entrusted with forming a multi-ethnic band.)
So when you start watching the film you get the feeling of a happy story, maybe even comedy, but the film goes deeper and deeper.
Same plot as always when it comes to Yugoslav film school-everything begins with funny plot and everyone think it will end funny, too.
the plot: syphilis appears in the small Yugoslavian army unit on the border with Albania and a soldier-doctor is forced to visit lieutenant's wife to send her his regards, but he falls in love with her... but the main problem in this film is bad adaptation from novel of Ante Tomic to scenario... so we see a lot of lack of motivation and when the comedy is turned into tragedy we can't understand why.
What exactly is the point of making a sequel when you don't actually retain anything that was good about the original?
At the same time, the film pauses where you want it to, gives you a silent moment to watch Bambi's ears fall slowly when he is disappointed, or freeze with him when he's terrified.
The methods here in conveying emotion are excellent; you really feel it when Bambi is sad or trying to earn his father's pride, and there are moments when you feel him growing up.
It was as sequels usually are...  Bambi was a such a huge movie when I was a kid.
Anyways, when compared to the other sequels Disnaye has been releasing, this flaws are really minor, as "Bambi II" makes a nice addition that at times surpasses the current theatrical released Disney films.
It's an intoxicating feeling when a movie excites and enlivens us like this -- and there's a particular giddiness to be had in thinking about what movies can (but don't often) do for one's soul after imbibing such a fine vintage!
Anyways, when I heared that Bambi 2 was coming out I rolled my eyes and thought that here goes another classic.
But I looked at Bambi 2 in a whole new light when I heard that Andreas Deja (one of Disney's best animators) was on board for the project.
It's a great in between story about from when Bambi's mother dies and he is reunited with his father the Great Prince.
I had no expectations whatsoever of this movie when my family and I sat down to watch it.
Sadly, poor stop motion effects mean it is a disappointment when it comes to seeing the screamers attack but it is not hard to overlook special effects for a good story.
We also get to know Ronno when he was little.
The time when this takes place makes one wonder and to make this question even more difficult, there are things that do not make sense when we look at the way how things happen in the original.
I loved the return of Thumper, it's always a pleasure to see him on screen, I loved when he was trying to show Bambi's father that Bambi could be brave, but Bambi needed more time, so Thumper does his best to distract Bambi's dad, it was so cute and funny.
See, Disney has lost its charm by this point (it's lost it for years--at least since the 70's, when the films became more savvy than charming) and they were trying to necromance a charming movie.
Instead of the atmospheric silence of the original film, we have hideous pop songs slapped in when the characters aren't yapping.
I watched the original Bambi movie frequently when I was young, so seeing such a great sequel of one of my favorite childhood movies really heartens me.
Especially when compared to many other substandard Disney sequels, Bambi 2 is definitely a superb continuation of the classic masterpiece.
I'm an 18 year old guy, and I watched Bambi for the first time when I was 3 years old and I still remember how sad I felt when his mom died.
I was really worried when I heard there was going to be a sequel.
After bidding a tearful farewell to her favorite leopard (which is shown making choked-up faces when she walks away) she sets sail for Hong Kong with Mighty Peking Man chained to the deck of the ship, and from then out out it's more or less like "King Kong" only funnier.
However, when they lives longer and longer, the father and son relationship grew.
I used to watch this show when I was a little girl.
Now, in conclusion, when and if this show is ever brought back on the air, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
Now, "Newhart" had a lot more going for it than "Seinfeld" did when they started.
On "Newhart," Joanna's role was as a pillar of strength for Innkeeper Dick to hang onto when everything was going crazy, while Emily and Dr. Bob took turns skewering each other and their friends and situations with devilish 70s glee.
But when they switched to film and they added the talented Peter Scolari and Julia Duffy, things took off!
I notice that this series & some others that are linked to it -- Bosom Buddies (Peter Scolari) Mary Frann, describe the series has having 3 or 4 episodes, when we know that the show ran 8 seasons.
This series ended on a high when (spoiler) in the last episode they tied it back directly to The Bob Newhart Show.
Please do not make the same mistake as I did when I believed the positive critics this film received.
But because of the intensity of his love, when the lad vanishes, the soldier must hunt in the Thai jungle for him.
The lovely performances by Banlop Lomnoi and Sakda Kaewbaudee, as the two men drawn into this surrealistic drama, help to ground the film enough in reality so that we go along with it even when we don't always understand it.
Tam tells the women she can restore his humanity and claim him, if when the faeries pass on Halloween night, she will wrap her arms around him and not let go no matter what happens.
Keng gives Tong a Clash tape but later tells him that when he gave him the tape he forgot to give him his heart.
You might be surprised when I point out that Carter never fought Griffith for a world championship in 1963 though he did fight for the middlewight championship a year later against champion Joey Giardello who beat him on points with plenty to spare .
You might also be shocked to know that Carter was never in fact much more than an average fighter who was well past his prime when arrested for murder so why this movie is making out that Rubin Carter would have been a boxing great if it wasn't for being WRONGLY convicted of murder I have no idea .
Meekly Rubin forgives his captor because that's who Rubin is - A noble forgiving paragon of humility , we're only three scenes into this movie and we're weeping tears for the guy , in fact you have to wonder why such a great guy was ever convicted of murder when he was a decorated war hero with a chest full of medals and we don't have to wait too long because it transpires that the cops are racist .
Thankfully justice is served though be it belatedly when a bunch of Canadians expose this terrible miscarriage of justice and Rubin is set free .
Everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint (except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife) but why wouldn't it-after all, it is his point of view.
Ruben Carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to.
My personal favorite is when Selleck's wife is awoken in bed by a voice whispering her name.
Another good scene is when the wife as a witch is stripped and whipped.
You'll see multiple head-scratchingly bad conversations between characters, and when they're over, you'll ask, "what was the point of that?"
Everything is heavy handed, and when it seems that the filmmakers couldn't think of anymore ridiculous action sequences they filled it in with over-drawn, slow motion explosions, slow motion scenes of John Cena running, or slow motion scenes of a car flying through the air.
The action, when it happens, isn't bad, and it would seem that the only thing John Cena CAN do (because he certainly can't act) is beat the crap out of people while grunting and growling like a caveman.
Or when the main villain was trying to get his cable upgraded with a sports package while trying to hide from the cops was just unnecessary.
Remember CRITTERS, the 1980s movie about small alien creatures that looked like balls of fur and they rolled all over the place when they attacked unsuspecting earthlings.
when his wife thinks he dies, she doesn't even changer her facial expressions...she just shrugs it off like it's no big thing.
About 2 decades ago, people witnessed the age of when the action genre in films was at its finest.
I mean the problem basically occurred by chance and coincidence when Triton and his wife just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time at the gas station.
Especially the part when Morgan is telling about his experiences with his camp counselor and Rome ordering him to find the generator.
And towards the end when Triton surely kills Rome in the blast, then after reviving his wife, Rome suddenly rises again with severe burns and then Triton kills him for good, VERY VERY B movie, if you ask me.
His face remains exactly the same plain thing during the whole movie; when he kisses his wife, when he's angry, when he's sad, when he's happy, when he's a douche.
But about 1/3 of the way through this poor excuse for an action film, I was very happy that they had him wear a camouflage Army cover (hat for you non-military types) instead of a cornered Marine issue cover when he saluted that officer because neither he nor his character deserved to wear a Marine uniform.
when this is done, a contestant is asked why they choose the person.
At first glance you might think this wouldn't be a Paul film, but when you consider my love for picnics and the outback, maybe you'll realize this has many of the ingredients i love in a movie.
The novelist was always evasive when asked about the events, but it seems certain they never occurred.
The director clearly is a fan of Hitchcock, and it's too bad that the film was not better executed, but in fact, it is nearly a parody of pulp fiction, including the soundtrack screeching at us when we are supposed to pay attention.
It's all cliche, all predictable, and, even worse, the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously, (even when the plot developments are laughable).
The stereotyped characters that I had enjoyed any years ago only annoy now, and Josie's lines when she returned to the show during the big 'shout' made a roomful of viewers laugh with embarrassment.
A critically important component of virtually all successful cinema is suspense, a perception of uncertainty within the viewer as to what may ensue from the events occurring upon the screen, whichever genre, present even when we know an outcome (Apollo 13) if the work is done well; all of which is meant to point to a total absence of suspense in this weakly directed feature, which dully plods from scene to scene until its flat ending.
Also, the main characters want to keep the railway going purely out of a desire to uphold tradition, when alternative forms of transportation are far more efficient and a Hell of a lot safer.
It makes it difficult to believe that everybody should be so keen for the railway to continue when every journey they go on is fraught with safety hazards and delays; most people would sod it for a game of soldiers and get the bus instead.
The lines were dumb especially when Ociee Nash met the president and fell down when nobody moved out of her way, then saying a little later to the president her opinion of "hurrying slowly" which the president and everybody there found to be a great idea.
The only part I liked was when Ociee Nash did something heroic and "unladylike" which also pleased people later in the film.
If that's all you need then tune in, but when it first aired in America, few did, and it ranked 152nd out of the 156 original series produced for network television in the 2005-06 season Â and was then dropped after eight episodes.
Even when I was a kid, I had no problem with that because I knew that rabies just wasn't treatable in those days.
Why didn't they keep the dog inside when they couldn't keep an eye on him?
For one, the song played on E.S' car radio when pulled up alongside a very right-wing Israeli driver was "I put a spell on you" by Natacha Atlas.
But mostly it's long, long scenes of nothing happening - or things which look like they're dripping with meaning (a checkpoint tower crashing to the ground, an Arafat balloon floating into Jerusalem, a crouching tiger women deflecting bullets into a halo) but when you try to derive some meaning, there's no there there.
Then, just when you and your friends think you can't possibly laugh any more, amidst all the Chinese actors appears a beautiful blonde westerner!
ClichÃ©d, tiresome psychological thriller/horror movie with a one-note central performance by Liv Corfixen, whose titular feline is accidentally possessed by a demon, when it happens to gate-crash an occult seance by the upstairs neighbours.
It was really frustrating when again and again, scenes would "chop"--with chunks missing and the scene abruptly changing.
Excruciating 'tenderfoot western' has young, overeager greenhorn Gary Grimes begging bearded, salty cattle boss Billy "Green" Bush for a job on his cattle drive--to get away from life on the farm with Ma, but also to be a real cowboy, apparently an occupation you take up "when you can't do nothing else."
It's too bad that someone took such a good name for a movie...I mean the title alone gives anyone an idea or three about what this movie could have been...(almost famous, requiem for a dream...just to name two extremes...and extremely good, creative movies with similar resources)...It's like when a band takes a great name and shoulda' just named themselves 'another lame-ass band'... Well, the same thing holds true here...a great writer could have taken the same concept (forget the name) and driven this movie into a completely original direction with some real drama, real comedy and real emo-tion...instead, we get what we get...plus now this great title is attached to this run of the mill, halfass storyline with so-so performances...
So I really don't get it (or maybe just let down) when I see something that has been given great resources and it's not even nearly the best it could be..Specifically, when I see a movie that has had a decent budget thrown at it and it turns out mediocre (at best)..well, it's just too bad...someone fell down somewhere...I think in this case it was a combination of people not giving it their all...starting with the screen writing and then dribbling down to the casting...then onto the direction and the actors themselves...it's just not as good as you would hope for (especially with the great movie name, again)... and that's all I gotta' say about that....F...F.G.
Things to watch for: the explorers climb a cliff with no supplies, but somehow a huge tent filled with sleeping cots is set up in the next scene; the plane diary is in English in a Chinese movie and although the jungle girl can only grunt, she can read the handwriting in the diary with no trouble; the "costume" she wears keeps peeling off when she runs...you can even see some of the glue peeling in a couple scenes; AND, the tree-climbing scene is NOT to be missed!!!!
While Poe's text was full of eloquence (The days have never been when thou couldst love me- but her whom in life thou didst abhor, in death thou shalt adore), this script is driven by pretentious voice-overs.
Munchie is ancient, grants wishes, but doesn't really do anything cool besides fly a pizza into the kids room when he is denied dinner.
Every step of the way, every participant must have known that the movie was an absolute failure...when it was written, when the actors were hired, during production design, during editing, mastering the DVD, writing the crap on the back cover ("Our three astronauts are running out of air...Blake must be caught and forced to tell the password that will reactivate the shuttle's life support systems.")
They said JMV had a huge drinking problem (it's also in the trivia) and that when he got on board the producers or whatever hadn't met him.
The viewer can decide what sort of leauge it is.First things first,some reviews have given the impression that the bad girls/innocent boy scene is more graphic than what it is.It's a scene that's more like 50% visual-50% imagination.The newspaper in the film states that the young man was attacked,it doesn't use the r word.Some reviewers are stating an act happened that the law says is not possible.At least that was the law when I was an adolescent more than 40 years ago and spent time researching important information like that,I'm still trying to figure it out.
:) (it looses a lot when translated)  It was sooo sad when Ivo Caprino died, who created this.
This is a low-budget little drama written by Ed Wood Jr. focusing on what can happen when parents don't make enough time to spend with their children.
But the film still provides a good lesson for young filmmakers about what to do, and especially what not to do, when making a cheap movie.
And, when they raped a man and left him and his girlfriend as witnesses, don't you think they could have identified the girls?!
And, later in the film, when one of the father's co-workers comes to the house and one of the girls' boyfriends pulls a knife and threatens the visitor, don't you think perhaps this MIGHT have clued somebody in to the fact that the girl and her friends were up to no good?!
I particularly loved it when two of the bad girls just told a crook that they shot a cop---and then this crook picks up the phone and tries to call the police!
But their misfortunes actually start when they do camp in an allegedly abandoned cabin that's not so empty they think; then the terror really begins.
Special cameo in flashback as a paramedic of David Naughton, the starring of the classic 'American werewolf in London'which the hikers comment when they're walking.
I mean the woman who is supposedly getting raped just looks bored and the hillbillys obviously have their clothes on when they are supposed to be raping her.
This has gone down in my personal history as THE movie to reference when I want to talk about bad movies.
I don't like it when I have seen a great actor many great movies and in many great roles and then some director or someone has them in role that makes them a total joke and I don't care if the actor agreed to it or not it shouldn't be done in My opinion!
They sure gave this thing a good write up on the DVD box but sadly it was no surprise at all when this movie turned out to be a major piece of junk.I was pretty drunk when I watched this thing so I may not get all the details exactly right BUT it was bad ,that much I do remember.
In fact it was sort of a relief when he would kill one of these bad acting idiots.This was a totally lame and totally forgettable piece of junk that isn't worth your time.
But when a film racks up a kill count that reaches double figures (I counted ten, including several by pick-axe), but prefers to suggest the carnage rather than gross out the audience (probably 'cos it's cheaper that way), you can't help but feel disappointed and cheated.
I think the coolest scenes was when Mario Lopez, then that 2nd guy (baby daddy) discovered the girl lying beautifully in the woods and realizing that her head was on backwards.
Then a zombie comes knock down the boy (the girl were enjoying with her eyes closed) and started licking the girls toes for a little time when it Bytes her toes and she starts screaming because she thoughts that there was the boy licking her.
I even fast forward some parts when they where running.
Another example is when the survivor groups meet up.
We hear a gunshot when a survivor of the army meets group B and group A run towards the camera after hearing it and claiming "we're saved".
Remember this isn't the early 1930s, when the effects for King Kong were pretty amazing in that context.
An example is when Reodor(the mecanic), Solan (the bird) and Ludvig are watching tv.
There is a dead moose head on the wall, and when they are watching tv it looks down with its eyes for a while!
Also most of the film's action is in the last 30 minutes and even when you finally reach that point of the film you are simply not interested anymore.
He is probably best known as the archaeologist who screams so memorably well in THE MUMMY when the monster approaches him in a tomb.
If you like realism then i wish you luck when watching this movie... and worse still it sucked 3 hours of my life away!
Check out the character of Randolf who starts off by speaking in a scouse accent then when he gets found out reverts to an Australian accent .
Many historical questions must be raised when dealing with something so historical such as a holocaust.
There's a moment of the movie when Benigni manages to reach the lowest Â an endeavour you had thought not possible after one hour and a half of the previous ordeal Â it is when he, very underhandedly, provides the viewers with a thick mist in order to veil, that is to hide, a pile of corpses of prisoners murdered by the Nazis.
And when his team mates are let-down you'd think they'd come down hard for his lack of commitment to the team.
I have some pretty stupid goofy movies in my collection, for when I want something mindless.
Like I said when I started, it's a mess.
The 'recupero,' as the Italian film industry dubbed it, was one of the most forlornly hopeful forms of film-making: offsetting part of the cost of the film you wanted to make by filming another on the cheap back-to-back with as many of the same cast, crew and locations as possible in the hope that at least one of them would be a hit even though just about the only recorded case of that ever happening was when Il Magnifico Straniero, shot back-to-back with Bullets Don't Argue to 'use up waste materials,' became a surprise hit after changing its title to Fistful of Dollars.
The closest it comes to charm is when the real cold that Stone is obviously suffering in one scene is clearly caught by Chamberlain in the next.
Like most fans of the series, I was ultra-excited when I heard that the original director was going to make his own sequel to his film.
She doesn't cause any problems for anyone, so when the people who harass her the most begin to meet their deaths, the audience can silently cheer.
Typical teenage behavior is shown, and when the campers begin picking on Alan (who again, DESERVES IT!
I first watched this movie when I was about five years old (already at that time it was old) and I've seen it many times since.
My expectations are rather low when we're talking about sequels.
Let alone, when the budget is evidently low and the story looks predictable to begin with.
Alan (that's the main character's name) is everyone's favorite target when it's time to pull pranks.
This is the worst sleepaway movie I have ever seen.What a travesty and even the killer was lame and overacted.The cast if you can even call them that couldn't act for nothing.Especially the so called victim who was too much of a jerk to care about to begin with .His acting was absolutely horrid as was pretty much everyone else's in the cast and the ending WTH was that made no sense whatsoever and just ended abruptly for no reason.It was hilarious how most people reacted when they were killed talk about BAD acting totally horrid.
When I was watching this movie, i thought, huh, maybe it will get better and when it didn't i though maybe it will actually go somewhere but no.
He doesn't earn a lot of money, he drives old ramshackle car, and live in a hovel, when everyday he can be beaten by his neighbors.
Evie Decker was played by Lili Taylor - who is pretty enough when she has her hair done and some make-up on - which she very seldom does in this film--but that works for the type of character she is playing.
I saw this with a friend on the spur of the moment, not knowing anything about it, when the film we went to see was sold out.
I got to tell you, when I saw this film last week.
Because I have a Surround Sound so when the action sequences are on, the box will tremble.
In an era when we can see SIX FEET UNDER and SCRUBS on the box, who would want to go to a cinema or pay good money to buy or rent this?
Yes, I have been impressed by the good animation on recent animation movies, and some of them even have a darned good plot, but they don't even come close when it comes to sheer entertainment value.
And even when it comes to animation, this movie,despite it's age, are better than some of the new ones!
Some highlights include the music score, which is slightly more creative than most films from this genre, but I laughed out loud when Lamas confronts an art museum tour group by pointing at a photo of a homeless guy and angrily yelling, "Do any of you see that the man in this photograph spends the night freezing, out in the cold?"
and then the end just when u think things couldint get any worse they do.
i hate when guys take advantage of innocent girls its soo cliche.
The description on this title is misleading, i.e.,: "Tensions arise when a newlywed has her husband move into the house of her verbally abusive mother."
I guess when you see the title "The Boston Strangler", you expect to see a remake of the 1968 classic, brought up to date, with modern film making, but no such luck with this title.
In a film about a serial killer you expect, suspense, danger,twists and turns, a psychological thriller, in this remake i am afraid to say the only twists and turns, is when you switch it off.
I first saw this movie when i was 11 years old, and it was love at first sight.
You will surely laugh at the awful singing when you watch this movie!
I thought this movie was stupid when I first saw it when I was 14.
It's a boring mystery tale, that never manages to get you involved, and when everything is revealed you don't get any particular pleasure from the resolution.
Lisa (Streep) must, of course, show a certain reserve when treating patients.
Where is Molly Goldberg when you need her?
The first time was funny, shocking when you first see it.
My favorite example would be when Rafi points out that when one lives in Manhattan, a few hundred square feet of one's apartment is all one has.
Perhaps this is why it is so hard to swallow anything when either Rafi and Dave claim that they love each other.
Younger never gives the characters real dimension or qualities that would make the audience draw towards them, so when the film ends, you don't feel the connection with the characters that is needed for the ending to be felt the way Younger wants it to be felt.
Younger seems to focus too much on the topics that come to people easily when thinking about relationships with such a great age difference, such as one person who wants a baby while the other person wants the newest X-Box game, etc..
The most clichÃ© topics are touched on throughout the film, like being carded when buying liquor, playing video games instead of having sex, or being old enough to be his mother.
Why is she the therapist when SHE is the one who needs the therapy???
There are more questions remaining... how can we go through this farce believing they are mother-and-son when they ain't got a glimmer of resemblance??
Funniest (not wholly intentionally) of all is Streep and about half way through the film I roared out loud (causing some of my fellow passengers to look up) when I realised who she reminded me of - it was Dustin Hoffman in drag in Tootsie - the spitting image of Steep's Mama/psychoanalyst!
Imagine my surprise when the movie ended that it had only been two hours since it began.
Further, the flashback scenes were so out of place the viewer can't help but lose track of what is happening and when it is happening.
I first saw this when I was at Universitet i Oslo and I went to the film festival in about 1990.
Rafi gets cheesed when she learns Dave is dating.
Why, for instance, should it be taken for granted that fatherhood would spoil the life of a 24-year-old man, even when he has made the decision himself to go through with it?
Why did David have to be so pitifully immature when others his age are already in, and enjoying, responsible positions?
The skits suffer from what I like to call SNL-ites (even when they are not funny to start with, they STILL go on way to long).
Get back to me when you become funny again.
Also, if you've seen this movie and watched the scene where the entire backstory is explained via scroll, you will know what I mean when I say: whatever happened to the dog?
(Another is when the group has defeated the giant centipede demon, which had approached them disguised as an old woman, and one of the samurai astutely remarks, "THAT wasn't your mother!")
The writing was "sooo" atrocious, I realize that screenwriters have a certain latitude when writing the story but, this story was pushing the envelope a wee bit too much: The mother starts in on a long diatribe on the matter of love the moment she meets the husband to be, also the cooking host on TV says this is a "family show" but continually uses the "F" word, or can you just imagine a man stalking a house in the bushes in broad daylight in an upscale neighborhood and all the neighbor could say was "you asshole", also how did they get the time to fix the truck and also not be seen, so it could stop on cue and how did Keeler get the time to get into the back of the van; where were the police and why was the couple moving themselves, don't lawyers make any money in Florida?
***SPOILER WARNING**** I do give away some plot points, but trust me when I say you will see them comin' down Broadway.
The mental patients give unbelievably over-the-top performances, and the sex scenes involving Goldblum and the nurse (I will never forget his line when she gets on all fours for him and barks- "Less like a shnauzer, more like a wolf!")
He is "resurrected" when he finds a young boy who was raised as a dog and he attempts to cure him.
I remember when this came out it was the first kung fu film ever seen around our way and we were all excited about seeing it for sure .Although the action was mediocre at best it gave us our first taste of kung fu and our first taste of bad dubbing as well as bad film making or more precisely the way Chinese people were making films at the time .
I remember seeing it when it was first released, but seeing it again as an adult revealed lots of details:  1: Look at the eyes of the moose when the main caracters are watching tv.
Because I'm a sadist when it comes to bad films.
But worth a look when you're free  Needed Ryan Reynolds.
The film, also, has little reason to ever be released to DVD; however, inevitably when it is, a price of more than $1.05 is too expensive.
The lead snob lays it on really thick, which makes it somewhat enjoyable when he gets his comeuppance.
This movie made me cringe from the moment in the opening scene when "Taj" starts waxing philosophical to the dog with scrotal elephantitis, to the obligatory sword-fighting climax, when the hate-me-I'm-a-prick antagonist gets his ancestors' cremains in the face.
You know things aren't going well when the title character doesn't make an appearance in the 'sequel'.
I'm sure nobody is watching this type of movie for compelling characters and riveting plot, but when almost every single joke falls completely flat... every other blemish on the script becomes glaring.
Short of changing the actor who plays the lead character for a sequel, the worst thing you can do when making a sequel is get rid of the main character who is in this case also the title character (how can it be called Van wilder 2 if Van Wilder isn't freaking in it?).
The movie starts with the 3 hero's doing a pretty cool obstacle course at their grandfather's place but learn a valuable lesson when he turns off the power and then makes them attempt it backwards.
I was like three when that came to video.
I was 12 when I first watched this and I thought it was awful then as well.
I'm sure when this movie came out it was the greatest disappointment of whatever season it was released in.
I'm a man with, admittedly, unusual and quirky tastes when it comes to film and film actors/actresses.
At the end, the bad guy offers a fight deal against the grandpa when he is his prisoner.
When the ninja kids do their moves, they do not look realistic and they do not actually hit the targets when they do the moves, but the bad guys get hit anyway.
My favourite part was when the little kid went POW!
I actually laughed when Loni Anderson said "Rest in pieces".
The first two movies were cute, the third was...blech, but when a movie stars Hulk Hogan.... slow up on that, you've already lost all the money that you put into this flop; and then some.
when the original came out i was a little kid and it was great.
There are a few pop culture references there simply for the parents (and then, some parents are too young to appreciate them...I swear I was the only one in the theater who "got" the Poseidon Adventure reference...perhaps the other parents were still in diapers when that movie came out in the 70s...) but other than that not too thrilling.
But when their split up they have to fight their way back to camp.
okay this is a very funny show i remember when i first saw it i could not stop laughing but i after a while i had hear all the jokes and it was starting to get lame.
Unfortunately, Ms. Emerson's carefully planned plot to rob the "Central Trust and Savings Bank" of $40,000 goes awry, when her getaway car driver, a young Jackie Gleason (as Wilson), parks in the red.
I heard when it came out on DVD in Norway it shattered a lot of DVD records, anyone know when/if it is going to be released in US?
Something gotta give when almost everyone is speaking in their very own stilted "high-style".
Having said that, I notice the stories flow better when people other than Milch write.
Plot comes first, it seems, when others write.
None of Owen's pranks, and the situations that arise from them, are particularly original, clever, or compelling and so when you come to the highly predictable end you are almost relieved.
That was the only time I tensed up when watching this.
I saw this movie in Russia, Moscow in 75-76 when I was 8 years old.
I was in Norway once, but it was in spring and I missed your X-mas show :)  Can you picture my excitement, when I suddenly found FlÃ¥klypa Grand Prix on IMDB.com?
I am not familiar with the NJ corrections systems but if in fact this young man was in a maximum security prison (which the movie said it was when he was admitted) nothing really made any sense.
Even more so when the ex has proved that he is capable of entering her room, even when the door is closed.
These hotel doors left ajar did provide for one point where I thought 'now the fun begins', and that is when Yella leaves her room and seeks out her companion.
However, when all is said and done Petzold's "Yella" is a film full of irrelevant references pinned under the title of "artistic licence", it would be better suited to a total running time of 30 minutes, rather than forcing the viewer to endure 86 minutes worth of scenes depicting the supposed ideals of the capitalist West.
A love of "Moonlight Sonata" and "Road to Cairo" may be admirable, but not when the absence of such masterpieces would leave behind a film without the capability to evoke an emotion otherwise.
Especially when he was supposed to convey some sort of feeling at the time.
Which is a good thing, because the last thing I need when I get hold of the actual books to read is to have the awful scenes of this production spring into my mind's eye.
There was no sense of history like you feel when watching Lord of the Rings or some of the better fantasy movies (Dragonslayer, say).
I'm not an obsessed fan, I just know when something is really good, and this TV production ON ITS OWN was the typical trash you see on TV every day (except I quit watching TV in 1999 so I don't have to suffer) - in that sense it's fairly normal, and OK production.
I first read the Earthsea books by Ursula K. LeGuin back when I was probably about 9 or 10.
It's a shame when production companies and television/movie studios are allowed to take some great work of written fiction and butcher it to the point that the original author is embarrassed about it (see Slate 12/16/2004 - http://slate.msn.com/default.aspx?id=2111107 for Ursula K. LeGuin's own words about how "SciFi Channel ruined my books").
The producers were clearly looking for a way to rip off Harry Potter and/or the Lord of the Rings when they stumbled upon this venerable series of fantasy books.
Let's start with the scene when Ged and his father spot this attack on their village.
Stay silent and whisper to each other when the wizard and his newly-reincarnated step aside to talk of course!
), somebody just finishes saying no upon the pain of death to one person when this character suddenly seems too afraid of dying to reject the next person wanting the same thing.
What happened to their staves when Ged was caught?
Which reminds me, why were they not being chased inside, and why did those inside not hear them when they entered and quickly slammed the door shut?
24) There is no 'Amulet of Elfarran' The thing that Ged and Tenar put back together is the Ring of Erreth-Akbe which when rejoined allows them to recover the lost rune of peace.
Ged did not rise from the dead; he was re-born when he received his true name, but that happened when he was seven, and is something he shares with every other Archipelagan.
A few key points of my utter disenchantment (pun intended): 1) Ged was the same age throughout the entire movie when in the books we get to follow him from age 10 to 80.
Anyway, things take a turn for the worse in every sense when evil baddie Grace Jones shows up to claim the tat (I mean, treasure) for herself.
We know offensive film-making when we see it and we see it here, cowering in fear beneath our steely gaze.
i was the "henchman" in the black shirt and backwards ball cap with a hellraiser box tattoo, close up when the grenade went off, and I'm about to laugh cause it was so cheesy, but hey it was an easy 225 dollars,but i knew it was a straight to USA network movie when i saw it...but the Germans probably liked it a lot more, it was filmed in new port richey, florida, in basically someones field, the city was so proud that there was a movie being filmed their, that they treated the cast and crew like royalty, and threw them a big party (i.e.
even the crew realized what a turd this movie was....one guy just walked off the set, and i had to double for him, look for when the kid falls of the back of the boat and two guys haul him out of the water, they switched us mid scene, because they were to lazy to do a reshoot, and i look NOTHING like the guy i switched with...I'm at least 60 pounds more than him and a half a foot taller...i was the only extra that would get in the water without a fuss, i worked as a plumbers apprentice once...a little water doesn't bother me
When his buddy does go back Pare seeks him out in 1984 and when he finds him the scene is so ridiculously written it kills the whole movie.
Obviously you cannot expect a hit when movies are shot with a low budget and with a skeleton crew(which I'm sure this movie had).
I did like the end when the guy being interrogated turns out to be a very significant character in the movie(do not wanna spoil it).
Anyone that liked this movie must have absolutely no taste when it comes to movies
He never even said anything witty when he killed people in his action movies.
I'm talking late Three's Company when Jack worked for that guy with the beard.
He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black's.
Was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel?
Since i saw the preview i knew it wasn't going to be a great movie, i just didn't think it was gonna be that bad...  What happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie?
It's like, remember years ago when you'd see anything with your fave actor in it, even some of their really early pap from before they were famous, and you'd be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop.
The only relatively interesting scene was when Hope and her boyfriend hook up.
The storyline is non-linear, which when done properly can be really interesting, but when done poorly (as in this movie) is very confusing and distracting.
On the soundtrack two voices can be heard, a Dr. Barker (Shirley Cameron, the IMDb listing is definitely wrong as her character's name is Mrs. Barker not Mrs. Cameron which is obviously her real name) & a Mr. Hodge (Max Phipps) who talk about Kate's conditioning & that she is a completely different woman from that of a week ago... Thirst then cuts back to presumably a week ago when Kate was just an normal Australian living a normal life who is about to take an extended holiday on her own as unfortunately her architect boyfriend Derek Whitehall (Rod Mullinar) is too busy at work to join her.
There is a funny scene when an old woman listed as blue rinse lady (Paddy Burnet) bites someone on the neck during some sort of ceremony, she looks like cross dresser Barry Humphries in his Dame Edna Everidge costume, now that's scary folks!
I remember watching this when I was a teenager.
The plot is as mentioned in the other comments here, but I remember most the vampire Candid Camera moment when the main actress is undergoing forced "vampirization" therapy which consists of a the fake vampire cult sneaking human blood into everything.
Initially shocking, when carried to multiple instances it all becomes hilarious.
Everything changes when his daughter is kidnapped and put into pornography films in California.
When, in the movie, Quoyle confronts the Old Qouyle who has been cursing the house, we can almost hear the banjo from "Deliverance"; when they actually show Guy raping Agnes (a needless scene - we know he does it, the guy just told us.
and in the movie when Quoyle discovers his grandfather was 12 when he died, and Agnes says "You don't know Newfoundlanders."
So when I finally got around to seeing some of them, I approached them with low expectations.
Now I've seen "Outer Space Jitters", and I have to say... when I heard that the Besser-era shorts were bad, this is EXACTLY what I expected them to be like.
I anticipated a new take on a three-way gun battle, and when that didn't happen there wasn't much agonising about anything else.
It is sad when decent actors are involved in cheap rubbish like this that squander their talents.
Most notable are Stuart Whitman, who is a very competent actor but when placed in a cheap jungle thriller, albeit lacking any thrill, one wonders why they stooped so low.
They even copied the salute in the end when the hero and soldiers saluted.
I saw this film a while ago when I was on a big Z-grade zombie movie kick.
Worth watching if only for the sheer enjoyment of it being a short, a long lost cinematic tradition in an age when so many pop-tart films would be served in an 10 minute format.
as a movie buff it always worries me when they reveal most of the next events so early in a movie.
this might have been believable in 1960 when this genre wasn't as overused as it uses to be, but nowadays this is simply not plausible.
She still shows her remarkable poise and maturity as a performer at a very young age (she was 11 when it was filmed), but this lifelessly conventional release doesn't deserve her.
One night, however, when they sneak away from the campfire to have a night-swim, Robin doesn't seem too worried when Amelia warns that she's not a very skillful swimmer.
It certainly doesn't help that her mother is often gone to Denver, and when she is home the tensions of the distant relationship with her husband are quietly manifested, as Robin watches with her worried, faintly melancholy eyes.
So it should come as no surprise that Dorothy happens to be the resident psyhco, hiding a baby monitor in Robin's room to listen in any conversation that takes place in there, surreptitiously taking photos of her from the balcony and angrily lashing out on her when she happens to put too much chocolate chips in the cookie batter.
**  The "climax" which occurred within the last half hour - especially when the parents are visiting the villainess' former apartment with the elderly landlord (or building super), and their frantic musings, were more amusing than dramatic or frightening.
also, when he attends the "skinhead retreat", they show a female with a completely bald head, as if she just had cancer treatments.
I'm sorry but I'm sick of these sun dance winner movies being touted as great works of cinema, when they are really just awful white guilt trips.
The director tries to portray Gosling as an intelligent underachiever with the wrong mindset, which is very hard to believe when they have Gosling slur out lines that you would think to hear on an Episode of "South Park", and to believe that he could have intelligent people listen and believe what he's saying is outrageous.
I'd heard about this film when it won the Sundance prize, and immediately thought, given the accolade and the premise, that it had to be great.
But when this anti-Semitic Jew brings his thuggish skinhead buddies into a temple and has misgivings, here is where the lack of character development really becomes a problem.
But this is minor in comparison to the nonsensical protagonist and the un-paid-off story lines: Balint shoots a fellow Nazi, Drake, when Drake discovers that Balint is wearing a prayer shawl under his skinhead clothes (again -- WHY???)
Another error, when Danny vomits on the street, his girlfriend (who is actually not yet really his girlfriend) comes after him and french kisses him!!
Okay, there's this explanation of banishment when he was a child, but I just don't see how you can choose for being a skinhead after that.
Another unexplained event in the film is perhaps the best part: during the resensitivity seminar when Danny and his friends hear stories from Holocaust survivers.
Why Danny showed no anger/emotion at Phoenix or Zane when he saw them making love, the make out scene the day after , right when Danny just threw up, what exactly makes Danny so incredibly valuable to Zane and the fascists, Zane's laughable hairpiece, etc etc etc.
Why is that "TERRAIN - PULL UP" or "TOO LOW - GEAR" alarm ringing when the aircraft is flying at cruising altitude?
Mother in business suit insists on joining commandos when her presence at any point could betray and undermine the entire mission.
Even when he punches out the big kid in the principals office.
the movie was actually that bad.....Yes it is one of the worst movie ever it is non horror at all , should be a thriller of a low grade and never be made as horror at all .True that the plot start promising but i just lost all interest after 29 minute of hardly trying to keep my eyes open ....why you ask >>>well thats a Thai movie who tries to capture a phenomena that happen to turn it to supernatural base it is purely cultural which is OK an all but the movie have set Zero effort to place any fear There is suspense I give u that but overall the film could have been made into a much better film and in my own review i say the idea is great but the display is very very poor just give it try when u have time to kill and u are Bored so just by then knock yourself out lol
That would never happen, especially in 1997, when this movie was made.
These jitters, shakes, blurs and flashes, especially when used during talking heads or emotion laden file footage, totally disrespect the experience of the film's subjects.
I wasn't sure what to expect going into this, but when I watched it on Netflix I was pretty disappointed by the end of it.
I watched this movie in order to gain a deeper perspective when it comes to the gang culture.
Terry would defend his friend right to the end, only to end up going down in flames with him when the truth was finally revealed.
How can you set out to make a suspense thriller when the outcome, for largely political reasons, is practically a foregone conclusion.
The British version emphasized the songs' emotional resonance in the characters' lives; when they lip-synched them, they generally remained in their ordinary settings.
The American version, on the other hand, stresses how removed the songs are from the characters' brutal reality; when THEY lip-synch them, they generally find themselves in opulent Hollywood-style musical productions.
Thus when the characters stop lip-synching and resume their dreary existences, the effects are more jarring than in the miniseries version.
If somebody knows a hundred odd things about Italian cinema then it must be assumed that that person must surely have heard of Gianni Amelio.He is a great figure of Italian auteur cinema having made important films like Colpire al cuore,Il Ladro di bambini,Lamerica and CosÃ¬ ridevano.It is sad to state but a hard to digest truth is that "Le Chiavi di casa" is a film for which Gianni Amelio has failed miserably.There are elements in this film which have the potential to emotionally stir a viewer but they do not have any effect as they are presented in a disconnected manner.This is a film about a father and his troubled relationship with his invalid son but so many questions are left unanswered.It is not sure whether this film is favoring invalid children or is just showing fake sympathy.Casting for the film has not been done properly.There are times when "Le Chiavi di casa" appears as a pathetic euro pudding as it features an English actress Charlotte Rampling sharing screen space with an Italian actor Kim Rossi Stuart in Germany.
Gone are the days when people seem to be satisfied with a happy ending.
Gone are the days when movie patrons comprise mainly of yayas and manongs.
You don't lose your dignity when you get married.
Its unbelievable..... and when they finally reveal the over hype twist in the story, I'd say oh yeah..... big deal.
Yeah, it's watchable and you won't feel like you completely wasted your time, but there's a lot of times when you'll be thinking "Okay, someone either needs to get shot or this movie needs to end."
Since when has Chester Arthur ever been mentioned in films?
I was very hurt when I read some of the comments especially the one that says "Remind me again NEVBR to visit the Philippines" by Scott Weinberg.
Just from slightly different angles, but it was amusing when we first saw the exterior of the police station, and then later the cop is driving to the Natascha McElhone's apartment and WOW, it's the same building.
I even stomached stuff like DAY OF THE DEAD back when it first came out and people were hurling in the aisles.
My friends and I were literally on the floor laughing when the mother said that her daughter used to play at the abandoned steel factory.
The lead character was never out of breath except when he ran out of cigarettes.
Well, FEARDOTCOM is certainly mindless; indeed, I muttered out loud when the credits were running, "Oh my God!
The number of bloopers is just astonishing SPOILER**Just as a for instance: When McElhone rushes into the psychiatric ward of the hospital to talk to Dorff (with no explanation WHY he's in a psychiatric unit), is directed to his room "first door on the left," she is instantly there, finds him having a full-on seizure (with no medical people in attendance, mind you), and suddenly -- when she, oh, so frightfully conveniently gets a phone call -- NOW she's got to go out the door onto a stair landing and through yet another doorway before she's back in the same corridor!
No offense to these folks, but when the best part of the movie is throwing it in the trash, you really need to reconsider what you're watching.
I was excited for this when it came out.
It wasn't like that, when a movie seems good at the start but goes downhill later; no.
This is the only movie I rated 1 on this site, and when the credits started rolling, I immediately put this movie into the AAAC-category.
At the end, the male lead summons his partner when they have the killer cornered, he says, "I don't have time to call for backup."
!Considering how high of a budget this movie had,it really had no explanation whatsoever for being as bad as it was.The special effects could've been done better by a toddler,the definition of "scary" in this film doesn't even come near the fright factor it needed to,and the ending and twists were completely unprofessional and mediocre.Basically,I felt I lost over half my brain cells when I was through watching this movie.This is the kind of filth that gives "horror",which if it could even fall under that category,a bad name.I wouldn't even recommend this movie for a good laugh at how horrible it is!!!!
Usually, when I see an extremely bad film, it's so awful that it's funny - which makes it somewhat entertaining.
It's simple: when you go in search of a killer, call for backup.
But, when the plot of a film is neither logical nor entertaining you get one movie: FeardotCom
It's almost at the end of it, and I will be glad when it will be over.
Yeah, it is sad when a show you watch ends.....but it is very different when something like this ends.
(but just for grins they (the unfortunates who log into fear.com) only die after 48 hours, because, I think, that's how long it took her to be killed) But I think you'd need a broadband connection, because somehow when you login, this girl living in the internet puts a hex on you, which involves you falling off your chair and eventually trashing your apartment and nose bleeds, and um, dying from the fright of your worst fear (like being cast in this movie) and I really don't think that could happen with a dial up connection.
I mean they threw that bit in there about finding the body, but then when it was found, it didn't count for anything!
I would highly recommend this movie to Christian denominations as a training aid to show the LDS Church's true feelings towards historic Christianity have never changed, how it glosses over its radical redefinition of terms, how it publicly denies it doctrines when convenient, and how the LDS Church continually attempts to divert attention from those attacks by wrapping itself within the claim that `they're persecuted!'
Yet when rebellion confronts her with the choice between fostering freedom and suppressing rebellion, she chooses suppression.
Vigil has some good ideas, and occasional moments when they're realized fairly well, but this is anything but a satisfying movie.
I don't usually give away the plot when reviewing movies, but the storyline of 'Pacific Heights' is so ludicrous that one cannot discuss the film properly without considering its absurdities.
equipment) which ends when he happens to falls onto some conveniently waiting iron spikes.
I almost gave up on it after the nauseating Ballgame scenes, but I became a little more interested when the plot picked up after Daryl is taken away by the government scientists.
You know how you just *have* to watch "BeastMaster" when it comes on, even tho' you know you shouldn't?
What a shame... when you have a child actor who is capable of stealing every scene, why not feature him in more scenes?
For the final third of the movie when he's back he's much better, funnier and it is a delight to watch him.
As part of her business dealings, she also likes to play sex games with her male clients, always beating them at their own game and dumping them when she wants.
And the movie was just *starting* to get good, he was just starting to loosen up and enjoy himself and then he dies ... and it goes even more downhill from there than when it started - hard to believe but true.
Who gets paid to write these idiotic movies (and gets them produced) when there are literally *millions* of good writers out there who struggle their guts out to get their stuff out there to knocked back at every turn?
Especially the sex scene when the woman takes off her clothes, then puts HIS pants on?
The only novel thing in the movie is the sudden shock it generates in the viewers when the Japanese guy dies unexpectedly.
In Israel as well when we want to describe the political complications or the effects of terror and war that always seem close if they are not present we talk about 'the situation'.
Needless to say, my thirteen year-old nephew was sorely disappointed when he could not follow what was going on!
I mean, who didn't cringe when they tried to explain away the force in "The Phantom Menace"?
All the other elements were fine, but if I'm not engaged by the story then I stop caring, and eventually lose interest, which is what happened when I saw this at the festival.
The acting is all fine, particularly the lead man and the voice on the phone (you'll know what I mean when you see it, it really is a lead role even though you never meet him) but there are so many wholes in the story that it never came together for me.
Lucinda is living the life of luxury and sure as hell wouldn't want to give it up for this oily and sweet talking Romeo who masquerades around as some big shot businessman Using his girlfriend Charlene, Beth Toussaint, to double as his personal secretary Scott has Lucinda think that he's a big success by always never being able to answer the phone, when she calls him.
The movie then really goes off the deep end of reality when we then see Gene and the man for all seasons-like Norm, who we were just lead on to believe was killed, in a restaurant looking at a number of hot photos of his wife and Scott in bed together giving us the impression that Gene knew all about Lucindas cheating on him and that Norm was really working for him right from the start!
The opening scene shows one of Harvey's thugs pumping gas out of the storage tank when the owner appears with gun in hand and threatens to kill the henchmen.
You see little blood and nobody is squibbed so that bloody explosions erupt when they are shot or wounded.
We learn that his wife died when an inebriated driver ran into her and killed her.
He shrugs when his father tells him that he going to see the FBI in Dallas to find a way to bring down Harvey Morris and his Dixie mafia.
It is never a good sign when the audience laughs at a film's most dramatic moments - and it happened several times during the screening that I attended of this film.
Strange vibes exist from day one when not-so-friendly-neighbor/pig farmer Jonas Dodd (Mark Boone Junior) refuses to say hello to Guy, creating an uneasy tension?, later resulting in many weird unexplained scenes, including a bloody pigs head on a stick during a casual walk through the woods.
The climax of "Sharkwater" comes when Stewart is laid up in a Central American hospital with what he describes as a life-threatening case of staph infection, or "flesh-eating disease."
Another thing that bothered me was when the photographer had to be hospitalized because he had a "Flesh Eating Disease", they didn't show the his leg and to movie makers that would have been the "Money Shot".
I think that the director should have consulted someone with more flair for journalism when he decided to make this movie political.
I was shooting documentary footage for several weeks last October in the Philippines, and this is what your footage looks like when you are shooting from a moving jeepney.
I have the man from Atlantis pilot and the City beneath the sea movie.And when i saw the movie The city beneath the sea i noticed that the character Aquila swam the same way that mark Harris dose on the show Man from Atlantis,did anyone else notice this besides me?If you did let me know.The show in it self was OK but not perfect.The year for city beneath the sea was [1971]and the man from Atlantis was [1977]If you have both the movie man from Atlantis/and city beneath the sea on VHS or DVD compare the two and see for your self that one was copied from the other as far as the swim moves goes,thanks for reading my comment
By the way when was the story set?
I saw the oldest boy wearing Nikes and jeans in one scene, yet when they finally left the house they were wearing clothes that have been outdated 50 years earlier than 1987 when the film was made.
i was so disappointed when i watched this movie.
I first saw this movie when I was about 7 and I really quite enjoyed it!
My guess is when the director yelled "cut!
Even more so when he announced, "that's a wrap!"
), but in one scene when the grandmother knocks over the daughters beloved (and highly fragile) music box, the daughter screams in agony and twitches her face as if she is enduring 15 lashes across her front torso.
I saw this movie when it was first released and I was so excited about it because of the profound effect the books had had on me.
The boy is the worst when it comes to standing up for the kids.
I was so disappointed when i saw this movie.
I read the book back when I was in college.

But when you cheap out and use a hack to write and direct, you get garbage on the screen.
Andrews, whom I think knew what she was doing when she had the story end the way it did.
And when it is stripped off that, it becomes a story that easily you and me or any John Doe could write.
So she and the equally cruel grandmother lock the kids up in the attic... until the fine moment comes when she'd win the old man's heart back and tell her everything.
And how wonderfully indifferent Andrews is when she writes about it, the storyteller being Cathy.
How can she act so blunt when she's the central character?
Charles Coburn was a fine actor and could be gruff when he needed to be.
Anna May Wong should have quit when sound came in.
She doesn't seem to have wanted to be an actress and was relegated to uncredited mother roles when she had to return to make money.
So, after flying across the Pacific, stopping over in Taipei and then landing in the Philippines, Adam is perplexed when his mother does not meet him at the airport.
It must have looked brilliant when they got Sean and Madonna in the same movie.
It is truly a sad indictment of the state of the British film industry when funding can be made available for predictable, plodding, saccharine nonsense like this at the expense of other more worthy projects.
So, apart from that dread feeling when you realise within 90 seconds that your money has been wasted, and that do I or don't I walk out of the cinema, what has the film got to offer?
The Murdles are so overlooked in this telling, that one may wonder, when Mr Murdle shows up at Fanny and Sparkler's apartment to ask for a pen knife (with which he later commits suicide), who he is and where he came from at that point.
Of course the real story was this: Old Mrs. Clennam's father had forced her and Arthur's father into marriage, when Arthur's father was actually in love with another woman (Arthur's real mother, who lived with and was provided for by Frederick), an affair that when discovered by Mrs. Clennam, sent her into an old testament rage, in which she took the baby (Arthur)to raise and drove his real mother into an insane asylum and eventually into her grave.
I would imagine that he cringed when he watched this for the first time.
etc The "plot" was paper thin, extremely poorly acted, the scriptwriter should be shot, the only shocks came from loud noises, there was no dramatic tension built up - the end of the film was always going to be simply when they got off the ship: there was nothing to "figure out" (like in Alien): no moral ambiguities were presented (like in The Fly): and there was no deadline to beat (a crude, but at times successful plot device).
"Virus" even quotes that film when an apparent survivor states that the oncoming crew must shut off the power-- for "it" needs power to survive.and to move in that madder.
I woke up one morning and saw that there was a new action thriller running called "Virus" I thought "yahoo" a movie for the international nerd, but when the movie started I soon relised that this wasen't a movie about a virus, but a horror thriller about a "electro" alien that is trying to take over the world using the help of half human robots witch it manufactures in a russian ship, a unlucky crew of a 5 stumbles upon the ship and tries to save the world from the evil alien.
I saw Alien and Aliens when I was little and they scared the hell out of me with their originality of the aliens, along with the feeling that you have been brutalized after you have seen them.
This is a surprise when one sees Donald Sutherland's name attached to this project.
I was laughing and turning my head a lot more times in this one then I was on the edge of my seat - except when I was ready to turn the movie off!
When I first watched this short, I actually was enjoying the new footage and when I saw the reused footage, I was quite dissapointed and when I saw reused footage from another episode, I was even more dissapointed and I think this short is only worth for the first 5-6 minutes and I understand that Curly was ill during this time and I think that Curly was more sick than usual in this short although Curly seemed more healthier in the next two shorts 'Uncivil Warbirds' and 'Three TroubleDoers' although his condition went even more downhill in the two shorts after that.
Deciding to attend his father's funeral, Adam arrives at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport now waiting to be picked up when a cell phone rings, which he promptly realizes to be inside his backpack enveloped along with some pictures of his mother and sister who an Abu Sayyaf member on the other line says have been kidnapped by their group.
Not really taking sides, the movie in the end shows Adam's girlfriend Dana (Dominique Gonzalez) explaining why she had to abort the baby: "ÂI panicked when I found out I was pregnant.
The movie seems to keep in line with reality when it comes to women seeking revenge over imagined slights.
The saddest moment is when that beautiful T-Bird goes sailing off into oblivion.
I am sad to say that the story is confusing, the audience laughed quite often when there obviously was no humour involved.
This is the when the titillation begins as we get to see Phoebe nude bathing and all of a sudden Willie's characters only interest is getting into Phoebe's pants and then turns into a spoiled adolescent who isn't getting his way.
Willie Aames is absolutely horrible in this film acting debut(which is probably why he didn't do much else in the movies) and Phoebe's OK when she's given a decent line.
I think the part that really set them off was when they showed the monkey miming what Aames did when he "pleasured" himself.
Fulci gets a lot of credit for "atmosphere", and I have to agree: Even when his films lacked a plot or a point, movies like Gates of Hell were just amazing because they gave off this weird, uncomforting feeling.
But when it comes down to it, they are just floating there, often times doing absolutely nothing, not talking or anything.
Alright, when I saw this movie on the shelves at my bro-in-law's mother's house, I figured it would be pretty good and asked to borrow it.
I mean, I know humans can never know what animals are exactly thinking which is why I love animal attack films, but come on, when an animal's hungry, IT'S GOING TO EAT, we know THAT much for sure.
And then when she submerges herself I said, "Is that it?
The first time I became aware of "Open Water" was driving home one night in 2003 stuck in the usual traffic jam when i noticed a huge bill board advertising the movie.
Being a big fan of Jaws and having been impressed by the Blair witch project I decided I would see it when released.
I was further intrigued when i read the premise for the story.
Despite my big surprise when I saw that this film got a low IMDb score (only 6/10) I decided to see the film because the preview looked promising.
LAter things go wrong when they marry and decide to have a child !!
After all they were foolish Indians- bred in remote Indian village - where it is thought that Abortion is a sin !SO when she was about to deliver, the Police Officer catches them - they escape yet again - but caught eventually but left on emotional grounds - marveling at their sharp brain and innocent hearts !!
Later , after a gap of 4 years when the child is 4 years old - the Police officer requests them to help the IPS Officers by rendering them their sharp brained services !!
A few opening scenes were okay which sets the tone of the film but later when the characters goes out of character, narration turns lifeless.
As the professor sets off to work, he and his wife are approached by their elderly neighbor Mrs. Niemoller who complains timidly that the boys in the neighborhood, including Timmy, make too much noise when they play and also heedlessly trample her garden.
Incidentally, Milland meets Hagen when he knocks on her door to complain about the loudness of the classical music coming from her phonograph player.
At one point she refers to his "big, thick head," when in fact his head is smaller than hers!
During the party Lana finds Katie dead & when the body is found the police accuse her & two other Omega Kappa girls of the murder, to clear themselves the girls have to turn detective to unmask the real killer & save Omega Kappa's reputation & them from going to prison...  Also known under the better sounding title of Pretty Little Devils this was directed by Irving Rothberg I wasn't sure what to expect from this going into it but even then I thought this was pretty poor stuff that feels like a thrown together mix of several genres none of which are done justice here.
Dunne is told not to emote as much as low A from her range when Tearle's around.
But when she mistakes the notorious bandit Stingaree for the composer, they're taken with each other.
But when he chances to hear Hilda singing, and gets to meet her, he abandons his plan and, instead, decides to help her Â his ruse is uncovered, however, and he is forced to flee, and takes the unwilling girl with him.
The shots last entirely way too long and when there finally is that cut you have been painfully waiting for it leaves you with a somewhat angry somewhat humorous thought in your mind.
Everything's gratuitous when you're not given anything to care about, and I certainly did not care about these people or their lives.
I wouldn't have laughed at that when i was in grade school (and yes, I get it.
The script was poor, and when a more humorous part of the film occurred, it was quickly wiped away by overkill.
It's understandable if a film is simply poor, but when the talent on disposal here comes up with something as utterly dull as what we see on Boytown, the frustration soon turns to sheer hostility.
The amount of hype that this movie received when it was released in the cinemas was complete overkill and did not justify the quality of the film, which really should be avoided like the plague.
Gary Oldman (HARRY POTTER films) stars as Paul, an Englishman on holiday in Spain's backwoods with his wife and another couple when they run afoul of the locals who are hiding a young girl away in what seems to be sickening conditions (they find her tied by the ankle in a dilapidated home drinking from a dog bowl).
Films of this genre, when well executed, are guaranteed, at the very least, cult-classic status (e.g., Deliverance and Straw Dogs).
However, when poorly executed, the resultant films can resemble a confusing, farcical mess.
At no time does he falter, even when he could save his life by telling the villagers where the disfigured girl is.
In "Cinderella man" with Russel Crowe, he was excellent and also in "In America," but in this movie, he was only interesting when he was not in a scene with Gary Oldman but in scenes with the other actors, he steals every scene.
Also, Serra uses the camera techniques of 70's directors which is OK at first but when he does this all the time it is distracting and does not serve any purpose except style.
Atkinson was reportedly going through a bit of a bad patch when this was made, and it shows as this is certainly not one of his best works.
It's a mysterious package with a ringing cell phone (think of The Matrix when Morpheus contacts Neo for the first time).
Thank God this film bombed when it was released; otherwise, who knows how many gay men would have committed suicide or stayed forever in the closet after seeing it?
Harry is the long-suffering partner who's recently been afflicted with alopecia and can't bear to leave his bald head unwrapped, even when he's taking a bath.
Charles needs Harry to wait on him hand and foot and to comfort him when he breaks down; Harry needs to feel needed, and Charles is the only person who can fit the bill for him.
Only once, when Charles fears that Harry is dead, does any sort of humanity come through.
These men sort of love their mothers, but there is a underlying feeling that they are both seeking a deeper relationship when various problems come between their relationship.
Supposedly according to the gay author, Harrison and Burton did it only for the huge paychecks of 1 millions dollars a piece which by todays standards would be the 20 million monster paydays you see the big stars get.Also,Harrison supposedly was disgusted with some of his dialog and left for Italy -only to come back when he was threatened with a lawsuit from the movie studio and Burton also only stuck around since his lover Elizabeth Taylor was filming a movie close by at the time.
I really wanted them to show some affection and maybe hug but the only scene for affection is when Harrison admits hes scared and falls into Burtons arms on the bed and Burton lightly strokes his hair.
Toward the end when he does his "not alone, not alone" speech, it's just hollow words.
The low point comes when Harrison picks up and brings home some ugly, aging prostitute.
The only interesting part is when Bosko cuts the head off a mouse that looks amazingly like Mickey!
I was SO relieved when I found the audio setup item which lets you switch to the original British voice talent!!
And when doesn't find his heart, he dies cause of agreement clause.
To balance my views , maybe that I was induced in error when realizing this was a bank robbery movie (I had no idea what the movie was about until I launched it), and disappointed in realizing that in fact it was a movie talking about social relationships.
Finally, I would like to say that when you are making a "made-for-TV" movie, there is no need to give it the feel of a "made-for-TV" movie.
It was shallow, disrespectful, and pointless to the end because you walk away knowing less about Dean than when you started.
I think the other dilemma of making a film about James Dean is that he was so young and still in the process of rising to fame when he died, that there doesn't seem to be many significant points of his life that can be stretched into an hour and a half film.
I should've bailed on this one when I had the chance.
- Joyce calls back immediately after seeing Derek's number on caller ID when Stacy and Barb accidentally call her with the computer, then proceeds to leave a message that makes it sound like she calls all the time.
Our dog just showed up on my doorstep, alone, rang my bell, barked in response to my calling his name, and when I went down he was suddenly under the stairs near the apartment below.
I saw this movie when I attended a free screening of it a couple weeks before it was released, and while I am no big fan of chick flicks, I had hopes for this film.
Actually, this is the only commendable part in the movie--when the lead star was asking her friend about truth and lies in a relationship!
After the famous verbal-hit-all-spill-all battle royale in the K-show, it's a downward spiral again when cosmic forces are called in to give a romantic twist in the movie.
Providence deserves the credit for forcing friends to acquaint me with the operas of Gilbert and Sullivan, when I was dead set against them (for no apparent reason).
But, in the case of 'Little Black Book' I am serious when I say that it is by far the worst movie I have ever had the horror of witnessing.
Really, the only bright spot in this movie is when Stacy gets what is coming to her (I laughed actually) and Holly Hunter.
Of course there is only one thing a decent person can possibly do when faced with this.
I remember when this show was announced several years ago, and all of the stops on the tour were laid out, I was wondering why any one would try to do a show like this when similar shows, Ben Hur and even Elton John's Aida met with mixed results.
The little boy character was trite, running away, at just the right moment when the paced lagged, cus thats what traumatized little boys in these kinds of movies do.
Plot twists are ridiculously contrived, as when the son disappears in the middle of a pitch-black night for no reason, and the daughter then does likewise, simply to allow an untended fire to get out of control.
Rather than having "zombies" pop up every so often and chase the leading characters around, why not show the quiet desperation people feel when they know that there are forces about to destroy them, but they don't understand those forces, and don't know exactly how (or when) they will be destroyed (which could mean actual death or a psychological "meltdown").
Much was made of "Topsy Turvy" when it came out, but if it's G&S music you're interested in, there's no comparison.
So what happens when you gather together a group of troubled teen undesirables (jocks, geeks, punks, cheerleaders, and dead-beats),a bumbling janitor, and a psychopathic homeroom teacher?
I'm not even kidding when I tell you that.
So believe me when i tell you, that this is the WORST HORROR MOVIE EVER MADE.
cause lord knows when i drive 4 random strangers to a concert for free i'm gonna do ANY of the legwork.
cause you know, when you get your hand cut off, you die right away.
A group of obnoxious high schoolers are on their way to a concert when they find that their car is running low on gas.
Clownish Zach(Brian Austin Jr), his fraidy-cat(..the kind afraid of her own shadow)constantly complaining girl-friend Justine(Lindsay Dell), annoying immature jock Josh(Eric Phillion), and high school hottie Taylor(Jenna Scott)find themselves looking for Drew when he leaves to find a possible fuel pump nearby the farmhouse never returning.
As they search through the farmhouse and barn, they encounter a backwoods psycho whose face is hidden by long messy black hair, quietly awaiting each victim before attacking from behind when they are most vulnerable.
The acting is horrible at best, the special effects are poor (when there is any) and the sound track doesn't fit in with what's happening in the movie.
One guy jokingly sticks his hand in a farm auger and when it turns on his hand is obviously mangled, but he dies instantly and his girlfriend runs off instead of helping him.
After all three boys are dead and the girls are being chased, one girl screams when she sees the farmer and the other girl actually asks her why she's screaming.
Another scene, the girls arm themselves with knives and when they come across the farmer, they hit him with the flashlight instead and run off.
Hmmm,three guys,and two girls who, together, are all too stupid to figure out what to do when low on gas.
Usually, when a director subjects you to this kind of terrible acting,ridiculous story,and pathetic props, they at least throw in a good serving of flesh as an apology.
The teens would usually overact or they would not act enough when the time called for it.
Why would they wait till they got to the concert to get gas when none of them have ever been in that part of the state?
In one of the more ridiculous scenes, the girls hitch a ride with an old farmer, only to have the killer come along when his truck is stopped to kill him.
A similar thing happens when they take refuge in a glass office.
This might be something like the First Officer suddenly developing a passion for early space exploration five seasons in, when it was more in keeping with the helmsman Paris, all because its the First Officer who has the rank to ignore the Captain and get everyone in trouble.
It gets particularly silly in later seasons when the ship is seriously threatened by shuttlecraft (I kid you not).
You can easily tell when they use the CGI for the dog and it looks terrible anyways.
You know, by 2004 I thought that there would be some standards when making movies but, I guess I was horribly mistaken.
Oh, and for the 'blink and you'll miss it scene' when a Tentacruel hugs Team Rocket!
This is like saying "ill go out in the rain with my best outfit on" Were they all blind when the animators were making this?
Let's put it this way: when it was shown on the cinema, it was a tie between the public, because half of them were children who loved the show, ergo they loved it, and the other half were the parents who went with them, and they probably fell asleep after the first ten minutes.
This movie portrays Mewtwo's encounter with humans for the first time, its reaction when its being controlled and its actions after it escapes.
I almost gagged when I saw the end credits, which was one of the best parts of the Japanese version.
Then when the main actually started, what we eventually got was...
This is what happens when too many people get involved in the development of a script.
Kelly is an odd character, he's a war buff because hey he has a vehicle and wears the clothing, and he works at a supermarket when there's nobody there, and he has a friend/co-worker named Sarah played by the adorable Shiri Appleby, another grossly under developed character who has a combined total of five scenes in the film and is never focused on.
She's a bit of a tease towards Kelly giving him little smiles and flirty come on's yet gets angered when he responds.
She's then given the plot that she's getting married to a guy named Miner to when she's ever asked about the marriage she quickly responds "I don't want to talk about it."
So Kelly confronts her in a really bad scene when she's crying complaining her fiance kissed another woman which leads to a kiss between the two characters.
None of Thesus's companions were killed and he took Ariadne when he left, etc ad nauseum.
I waited for something better, the effects didn't like me too much, especially when the beast was running, the plot was weak.
I had my hopes up when I saw the DVD on sale at last, having read already much about it.
The Minotaur was summoned up beforehand by the priest, so it could have expected its dinner coming down, but strangely enough it's no-where to be found when they all come down.
The acting was flat no feeling even when Todd's character tried to seduce his sister, sick and really had nothing to do with the movie.
Guys--recognize a stinker when you see one.
There was a flashback when the minotaur was born and he had eyes.
omg.. such as (spoiler) when one is trying to climb up from the maze, you can clearly see he is hanging by a large string..  everyone is going to disagree that i GAVE IT A two!
The worst part was that, when trapped in a series of caves with a killer critter, what would a person do?
The immediate air support didn't turn up until later when everybody had gone home, had they flown all the way from America?
Things get a bit more complicated when a thief enters the building.
Unlike Gianis Oikonomidis, Giannaris was never a director who went for perfection when it came to acting.
Usually when movies are filmed based on true stories, I tend to find out something about what happened before seeing the movie.
Chassity says she has no problems with gay people and even works on the gay student union, but when her mother is attacked a side of Chassity comes out.
Why was it that I adored the offerings of one Roger Corman all these years when his films and Boll's are very similar in their results.
In short, Corman and Boll both produce films that are un-watchable alone, but when enjoyed with friends, while having beers and yelling Mystery Science Theatre type comments at the screen, they can be fairly amusing.
One by one they go into the tunnel when the ones that went in prior don't come back out.
The bamboo stick through the neck was good and when the enemy circles in around the platoon in a wave of explosions and gunfire, there are some good dismemberments to keep you interested.
Death Touch later has sex with another prostitute, Jessie, but when he starts to hurt her (well, she is apparently supposed to be in pain even though she is smiling), the hotel manager comes running and Death Touch attacks him.
Jenks is in the arena looking for some cash when Taskin rushes in and starts a fight with Jenks.
"Le boulet" is the perfect definition for the word "disaster" : it happens when untalented French movie-makers try to do a parody of a bad Bud Spencer-Terence Hill buddy movie.
But it's not easy for the winner MoltÃ¨s-Lanvin getting hold of a lottery ticket when you have to drag a goofy bloke (Francis-Benoit Poelvoorde) with you.
The film makes no effort to create any sort of "transformation" when actor David Bruce goes from golly-gee lab assistant to shambling zombie; it is a straight cut-away, cut-back-to shot, and the latter finds him in uninspired make-up and with very untidy hair.
Director James P. Hogan maintains a pace every bit as leaden-footed as the zombie, and as for the script... well, it is probably this sort of script that Evelyn Ankers, the studio's "Scream Queen" of the 1940s, had in mind when she walked away from Universal a year later.
It is very easy to understand the solitude of the unpleasant Delphine and I recommend to see this movie on DVD, since the viewer will be able to use the rewind (when he or she takes an involuntary nap) or the fast forward button in case of unbearable boredom.
The retard should have been treated when he first struck but then the movie would have ended half an hour after it started.
I stopped watching when the retard started force feeding his sick mother pills to "make her better".
Early in the film when still portrayed as a happy idiot the father is constantly abusive and stern.
The sorry piece of movie will of course give us all some bad taste in our mouth when they make awkward and embarrassing scenes like seeing a retarded son trying to help his mother when she is seriously ill and crying, scenes where the retard tries to force his mother to eat pills because "the more you take, the better you will get".
Of course, when one does a little further research, one finds that the film was universally panned by just about everyone, and, in its one week engagement at actual movie theaters, it became one of the lowest grossing films in history - a whopping $360,000 or thereabouts.
It goes into horror-territory (almost) when the tunnels are introduced, but still keeps it realistic.
I love his popcorn-flicks, but I love even more when he comes in to more darker territories and shows us what the world is about.
A creepy moment early on, involving the ghost of a little girl on a swing, proves that the guys can create atmosphere and deliver an effective scare when necessary, and a delightfully twisted scene in which a pervy old man spies on his granddaughter in the shower earns them points for being willing to push the envelope, but to really do their ideas justice in future, Adams and Picardi really need to drum up some more cash for that professional finish and get themselves a decent cast.
It's quite tragic when a fresh idea gets thrown out in the form of a horrific film, but this movie delivers just that.
The opening dialogoue between the two main characters is a perfect example of what you're getting into when you view this film.
Several of my friends that saw the first tour said it was good, but when they saw the next tour they felt that the Get Back Tour was just a rehearsal for the one in 1993.
Paul hadn't toured in thirteen years and when you watch the DVD it really shows.
And Bergman has some hilarious dialogue, like the old lady at the train, comforting Ingeborg when she wakes up after a bad dream:  "You must've eaten something unsuitable.
I usually dream about a big negro biting my toes off when I have eaten something unsuitable.
Vidor mixes sentimentality and excitement a little ham-handedly, as when Colleen Moore regains the use of her legs so she can drag the unconscious John Bowers from the burning church.
On the other hand, some of the scenes -- as when John Bowers stands off a herd of stampeding cattle so they won't trample the obvious dummy standing in for Colleen Moore stand up very well.
What gave it away was the fact that the actors cast as high school students looked WAY too young (they only looked 23-25, when we were in school, we all looked at least 29).
I remembered this film was pretty violent, but there wasn't even a hint of blood showing when the barbarians slewed one another.
Whether or not he's the guy in the basement with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm is up to speculation, but it is mentioned in the movie that the doctor performed devious experiments when he was alive.
But no matter how you look at it, they all die and you'll also die a little inside when you go to google this house so you can stay there for a night and make your own bootleg ghosthunters TV show and try to sell it to the travel channel only to find out that you can't even find this house because nobody cared enough to put it's real location anywhere on the internet.
A good case in point is when the creepy babysitter, who has allowed caterpillars to roost on her face where other people have eyebrows, stupidly locks herself in the decrepit basement.
This farce of an action sequence descends all the way to the ninth level when DianaBob, having finally opened the basement door, finds himself in the same predicament as his babysitter.
Now, when most people, even small children, close their arms in doors, their basic instinct is to open the door a bit to dislodge the arm.
After hearing so much about his films when i was a teen, and seeing all his gory make up on Fangoria magazines, i decided to finally rent some of his stuff.
She was always in the house, even when the parents were there, and spent most of her screen time staring into space!
Only one scene stood out for me in this movie and that was when the realtor backs out of the driveway after leading the family to their new home, accidently knocking over a tombstone to which she yells, "DAMN TOMBSTONE!"
There is a weird babysitter who keeps popping up out of nowhere and a landlady who may as well walk around with a big sign saying "Next Victim" around her neck when she comes to visit.
The sub-professional screenwriter .....of this movie....., Arriaga, then reaches for the blow torch again when the Barry Pepper character 'escapes' from captivity and enters a cave to hide only to be bitten by a rattlesnake!
Repeated flashbacks can be acceptable in telling a story but only when the question is answered, "Would the story work better being told in a more linear fashion"?
During the early parts of Three Burials I was confused several times when characters I was just beginning to learn about were time shifted backwards.
Is this something you would do to a good friend when talking about your death and how you would want your family notified?
I'm generally in agreement with a lot of people's opinions on films, so when I was recommended this as being a simply awesome film I had to watch it.
when they would cut from one character to the next, it did not line up right.
I'm glad that when I was a kid I have better shows to see , this is just a stinker without redemption .
I might be so wrong,because I haven't seen this show in years,but how is this realistic?And what the hell is with the slang?I'm around lots of gangs nowadays,and I've never heard anyone say I've never heard the word "shoobee"or whatever it was.Even when I was at the beach in Maryland,I never heard one surfer kid say that.And what's with he word "lame-o"?Honestly,these kids are like 13 or 15 and they are still using baby ghetto talk.I haven't said "lame-o" since I was like firkin ten!
And when he does he always gets out of it, except in one instance.
The show is entertaining, but you don't want it to be, and you feel guilty when you like it.
Gee, if only Henry Kissinger would feel a little guilty when he undertips a waiter at a Vietnamese restaurant.
Anyone who lived through the years when he was Secretary of Defense knows that he personally lied constantly to the American people and he was, and is, guilty of war crimes (at least he admits to this point).
As such, this documentary is a shameful attempt to seek forgiveness and is just another lie on the part of someone who wants us to believe that he was a peacemaker, when in fact he was a contemptuous war criminal.
This film does not leave you feeling the need to throw out one liners with your friends over a couple of pints, it does not leave you believing they had some fun over in Vietnam like in Hamburger Hill when they go to the local massage parlour and get laid and drink beer (although Hamburger Hill does hit home), this film shows exactly what fighting that war was all about.
This film is very much a political message and what a shame these films were not made earlier when the actual war was taking place.
This is done early in the picture when it seems the movie might actually recreate the fun and excitement of "The In-Laws".
The jokes are so few and far between that the audience is itching for them when they come.
There is perhaps only one half-decent scene when a man is set alight and falls into a swimming pool, but apart from that the pace just plods along like a tortoise.
Trouble starts when Teri (Theresa Cooney) accidentally shoots and kills Weller's kidnapping henchman while hunting with her dad.
The world looks more colorful and uncertain when you are aware of its capacity and emptiness, rather depressing.
I almost wish that Boll had used a different name when he made it since I doubt the film will ever get the attention it deserves because of who he is.
Ian is meant to be from Sydney, but can't even hold his accent for an entire sentence, let alone even hit the right Aussie accent when he does.
My suggestion for the creator; centre on one plot, pay more attention to their acting talent than their bodies and be more assertive with your actors when it comes to direction.
In this standard sci-fi romance, the widow Andrea lives on a Greek island with her son Timmy and, like the other islanders, is amazed when a stranger Keir Dullea washes up on shore during a magnetic storm.
At first seeming to suffer from amnesia, the stranger has a mysterious quality that comes more into focus when he performs certain miracles.
I would say, that this is one of those films that work best when being viewed, home alone, late at night, with all the lights out, preferably on Halloween.
For example when Wil Wheaton's character views the Orb on the second night.
A struggling farmer believes God has blessed him when his crops begin to grow substantially after a large meteor lands in his field, dissolving into his soil and water supply after the local doc, Forbes(Cooper Huckabee), pokes a hole in it.
However when the animals start acting crazy and the humans shortly following suit, the devout father begins to think it's God's curse for his wife cheating.
And when they're left to die all on their own a thousand miles away from home, they don't feel like heroes at all and pride and glory are about the last things that they think ofÂ   The whole pointlessness of war is a constant and reoccurring theme in TUNNEL RATS and just like war itself ain't exactly fun and enjoyment, this film is also far from being your typical good time bubblegum blockbusterÂ TUNNEL RATS is very slow-paced, very raw, very dirty, very brutal, very pessimisticÂ and very honest.
Its sole novelty is the replacement of faux-hick accents (the norm when Hollywood films shitstorms like this) with broken English with eastern European accents and Croatian (with English subtitles).
The original "Basket Case" is a pretty cherished favorite of mine that, you could say, really 'rocked my world' when I inattentively rented it as a kid.
His mother wants him to get a job, but when he goes out he gets together with his friends and they spot a busty woman and flirt with her.
Truck warns them against trying to find the woman or the club, and when he learns Tymez was touched by her, he instructs them to duct tape him to his bed.
At the club, they're pretty happy watching women dancing, but when the call Truck again they're warned again, and indeed most of the people at the club are vampires!
The funniest scene in fact would have to be at the church near the end of the film when Sammy's rather heavily sedated sister attempts to walk down the aisle with daddy.
Funny, I saw this as a young kid and the only thing that made an impression on me was the beginning when Molly Ringwald's parents forget her birthday, and the final scene where she gets her happy ending.
*War and technology* Besides that, the tunnels and the jungle give a fairly well impression why no technology (so far) was a major help in such a fight - when it came down to man vs. man.....  Resume: not your average good-night-movie!
This movie begins when a cult called "The Sisters" are going through an initiation in which a bullet is put in a gun and fired off to test the courage of the new members.
when they get there they get taken by two random goofy guys to the house where they're supposed to meet.
Hey, this is more than what the recent Rambo film offered when all we got was a plethora of gore and disembowelment as 'justified' warfare was played out between those poor, poor Christians and those evil, evil Burmese soldiers.
This makes the scenes later on when a character lights up a cigarette down there even more harrowing.
The tunnels, however, remain off screen and we know what awaits the group, giving us a position of power Â a position of power that is further emphasised when we witness entire scenes dedicated to the Vietcong, the American's enemy, one occurrence of which sees the camera crane directly below a Tunnel Rat to reveal a makeshift Vietcong war room.
Shooting in low light and keeping his camera rock steady as his subject scurries and struggles about erratically, we feel frightened when people venture into the unknown and horrified when altercation with the enemy arises.
Yet, when it comes time to get some sleep, they all go to their separate bedrooms.
Why is it when people start getting killed, the characters do things like take showers, away from the rest of the group.
Liz is shot when a live round is loaded into a single-shot derringer instead of, one assumes, a blank.
Although the duo has been paid only to transport the quintet, the pair is with the girls when the fence around the estate closes, locks and electrifies.
Calling the meeting to order, the chairman blurts the stupidest line in cinema history when he says "GENTLEMEN, THE SITUATION BEFORE US IS SO BAD, IT'S WORSE THAN IT'S EVER BEEN BEFORE!"
However, when I took my girlfriend to see the Forbidden Kingdom it was painful to sit through the entire movie.
I had only been let down once this horribly from the overall rating before on IMDb and that was with Across the Universe when it got a review of 4 out of 10, when I thought it was a work of art.
As far as the technical side of things go people have to realize that when 98% of people will find the costumes and props fine, the studio isn't going spend a bunch of extra money to satisfy the extra 2%.
(life must've been great bad in those times)  5 - Our friendly heroes (now 2) get in another stint with authorities when they try to pay for their beverages with US dollars.
Even when looked at as a series in it's own right, completely set apart from Red Dwarf, the series lacks both a good plot and convincing characters.
This is the kind of movie Hollywood excels at and when they make a good one, it can be fabulous.
I know many girls have excellent taste in movies, so don't take it the wrong way when I call this movie a chick-flick.
She lies to the man she loves in both cases; runs away when times are tough ("for good times and bad, til death do us part" yeah right); publicly humiliates her friends (several times); betrays confidences that in the deep south could mean life or death--Give me a break!
I think that as moviegoers paying good money that we need to be a little more critical when a bad story, bad dialog and unbelievable situations arise in movies.
Imagine back to when you were 11 years old.
I was somewhat put at ease at the beginning of the film when it became obvious that this film did not take itself seriously (which CANNOT be said for most bad movies).
This is not exactly an Ed Wood movie, though when I got it from Netflix his name was plastered on it--not the director and co-writer's, Adrian Weiss.
Either way, when the film finally ends, it gets REALLY creepy, as the male gorilla doesn't exactly kidnap the lady but she goes off with him willingly--supposedly to become his lover.
Her expression is even happier than Ed Wood's in GLEN OR GLENDA when he first tries on an angora sweater!
However, it takes a greater person to admit when they were wrong and give credit when it is due, and it most certainly due.
I can imagine that when contracted to make Hollywood films, there is a lot of pressure to appeal to the attention deficit audiences out there, often the very ones that hate him, and therefore he aims too far above his mark.
It is the hight of arrogance to laugh at their efforts and belittle what they made when truly there is nothing really wrong with it.
Every film, when made earnestly, has something worthwhile to show us.
Except when she cries and really tries to express some feelings.
There is no intelligence to these characters as in a scene when Lowe starts yelling at Moore because she won't throw her tampons away which 1 minute later results in Moore storming out of the apartment.
This movie considers what life is like when 2 people attempt to build a relationship with sex as its foundation.
This is all well and good but problems arise when 2 of the characters mistakenly try to have a real relationship based on their like appetites for sex.
There weren't anywhere near that many spiders on the plane when it left Ecuador.
Eventually the things all converge on the local warehouse which is full of oranges, and the townspeople rig some kind of ridiculous device up that will cause the spiders to go into a sort of immobile state when they hear amplified wasp sounds.
I know, it's lame but I had never seen the film before today and then it all came back to me when I saw the scene.
And by the way, when a criminal moves into your home uninvited-CALL THE POLICE!!
She must have had him when she was 14 or so.
Omar Gooding as Sweatpea: A numbskull that curses out the same girlfriend and her mother that allowed his stupid a** to stay with them when he had no place to go.
Johnson, Taraji P Henson cant act but their characters are underdeveloped and poorly written Shouting and arguments turn into sexual situations and the most asinine scene in the movie has to be when Jody backhands Yvette after she punched him.
the longest conversation they had was about who had sex who when.
which reminds me, the worst scene was when Jody hits his girlfriend, and then goes down on her.
In the end when he is out,(this is, I presume, eight years later) he gets the money(so well hidden in 60 seconds eight years before that no one found it by accident in 8 years, including the police) and heads over to "his place".
Also, the movie didn't go by all the facts, even though these things were small in nature - for example, Billy Flynn was not a blond guy, he has brown hair and certain things in the film were altered from the true facts that were reported on national television when Pamela Smart was on trial for the murder of her husband, Greg Smart.
I think a lot of trouble with the picture had to do with the script - there just wasn't enough passion (not in the love sense, necessarily) in any of the scenes like when Smart (Hunt) is talking to Flynn (Chad Allen) about killing her husband, etc.
The plot has been explained by many others but (Spoiler alert) most missed the fact that Fonda had fathered a child years earlier when he and his "clean-cut" pals gang raped Holden's daughter and got away Scot-free.
It never sticks to one subject for long, and when it veers off in another direction, it fails to solidify into anything worthwhile.
Just as its known that for every time you have a good experience you tell one person, when you have a bad experience you tell ten, so goes this plot-less film.
I mean, shouldn't there have been something that made me feel sorry for Takashi when he died?
And why, oh, why nobody in the street was surprised to see a white girl walking around, when no foreigner had visited Japan for 10 years?
How does it fall so easily after two girls infiltrate it when it's supposed to be so powerful?
Max's speech implying that we the viewers are as bad as him because we have watched the killings didn't really seem relevant when we had been talking through most of them they were so dull.
After all, it was a time when the word "panties" was risquÃ©' in films.
Yet when all is said and done it is a pedantic court room drama with lots of court room and little drama.
I got a little disillusioned with the Mouse when their direct-to-video-sequel thing started.
Reminds me of when they have a "special" episode of a sitcom which is only recycled bits from the whole season.
Pam was crazy about Greg when he was a Van Halen look-alike but when he cut his hair and started to dress corporate (to work for an insurance company)did her feelings for him start to change then?
It shows about 6-7 different stories around the US that include a woman battling to keep custody of her son while the jerk of a father makes her life a living hell, a young man searching for the approval of his mother and estranged father - when his crazy aunt comes in early for their Christmas dinner to give him a new perspective, a young woman who is the maid of honor at her best friend's Christmas Eve wedding and the drama that ensues when it looks as if the wedding may be canceled due to weather not to mention the hidden feelings the young woman has for the groom-to-be, another woman who is trying to escape Christmas after her husband died last year at the same time, a conniving husband who is cheating on his wife while he tells her he is tied up at an airport, and finally the weather man who brings it all together during this once in a lifetime event.
Then again, look what happened to Ursula LeGuin's Earthsea when it made it to TV.
Morrie comes off sounding like that one sappy person in your family that everyone tries to ignore when you get together.
This remains evident even when all the occurrences depicted here were unfolding,   Story now skewed in her behalf, it's also boring as well.
She did not show any emotion when her husband was murdered.
What a surprise then, when I searched her on Google after watching the movie, to discover that she had written the required book, appeared on numerous chat shows, sold the film rights, etc.
Who could have possibly seen them that night - or was their 'victim' still alive when they dumped him into the sea?
I recognize a good movie when I see it, but I can still giggle and smirk during Bubble Boy (yes folks, its true); so when I say to avoid something, you KNOW I'm not kidding.
I expect to actually laugh or at least have some smiles when watching a comedy.
The characters are a silly mishmash of stereotypes--the paranoid Holocaust survivor, the neurotic, money-obsessed uber-assimilated (Dad makes Christmas ornaments), the neurotic, resentful Jewish mother, the "born-again" schnorring Hasid brother (whose ethics are less than sterling when it comes to his mom's glamorous cousin), the slut sister, the resentful lesbian half-sister and her black lover, and just for kicks, the secular, anti-religion Israeli guest .
I have never been one to hold up live-action adaptations to their source novels (I haven't even read this Agatha Christie book), and I think thought this episode was very good when viewed independently of the book!
How dumb can a Hindi movie be , when 3 people are sitting on a table and two are talking in Hindi , when the third one butts in and says 'English , Please' ?!!
However, this takes it to the extreme, such as when Ambar insults Nikhil day after day after day!
Near the end of the movie, when Nikhil starts looking for Ambar, random people all over Melbourne just drop everything to look for a pregnant woman in a black/white dress.
It is filled with slapstick comedy and romance that is quickly interrupted with deep rooted conversations about abortion and the definition of life when Preity turns up pregnant.
Movies like this work better when one lead plays the "straight character" that keeps the situations in the movie grounded in some semblance of reality.
Not so here, as both leads ham it up as much as possible only to interject moments of awkward seriousness when scenes call for it.
In such a scene, a concept of 'live-in" relationship looks promising but when you dig further what you are subjected to is another guys are guys and gals are gals type of Harry meet Sally clone very much on the lines (and influences too) of Â Hum Tum, Saathiya, Chalte Chalte, Kal Ho Na Ho et al.
Debutant writer-director Siddhartha Raj Anand, tried to delve into a mature topic and somehow manages to hold interest till interval with his some witty, smart, one-liners and hilarious situations when the film is still finding its premise.
Also, when heroine cries there is a Ganpati idol in the foreground and a Alaap in the background score.
Post-interval everything goes haywire when director gets into story-telling and tried to deal with too many themes and subplots without doing decent justice to even one of them.
I'm sure Agatha is in the great screening room in the sky loving the fact that her stories live on in the changing media of the 21st century - something she could never have dared to think when she wrote her novels....
Since the "living" dead girl of the title cannot speak when discovered by the two main male characters in an abandoned mental hospital, it is naturally assumed by the writer and director that at least one of the boys will instantly see the chained woman as a sex object, that is, after he kills her three times.
They simply use this dead-girl to satisfy their own twisted agendas and seem surprised when things don't go well.
The down side to having a creative mind when exposed to unexpected emotional and psychological horror of what humans can be capable of under the right circumstances is it leaves me upset and emotionally disturbed for days or weeks later.
The basement rapidly turns into a rendezvous place for horny losers, but then the fun is over when the girl bites back.
Myself, I went to Sunday school at the Temple, and worked with the stage crew in setting up the monthly illustrated sermon settings, and performed in many of them, from the late 1930's till just after her death when I went to the Navy.
I even played the kettle drums when the regular drummer did not show up for services.
The guy has gone psycho because of the violence he witnessed in Vietnam, and the fact that a Vietnamese prostitute (Charlotte Littrel) taunted and laughed at him when he couldn't get an erection!
Sad, because it starts out with a bang when the prison fakes Liotta's execution and he is then transported to Dafoe's lab to begin his transformation.
Do yourself a favor and skip over this film when you are looking to rent something.
Supposed to be a comedy, this dog stumbles clumsily along with a monotonous storyline punctuated with some comic relief which is so bad the only relief is when the film ends.
As I am quite old, I know people who saw her in public when she was young - say "Suddenly Last Summer" age (my opinion, her best) - say no one could take their eyes off her, she was so lovely.
But when a meeting goes bad and he gets framed again, he gets sucked in to another nightmare world of betrayal and red herrings.
My god, what the director and the whole crew members where thinking when they ware shooting the sequence when the main actor shoots at the two Koreans from 2 meters and runs out of bullet after depleting the gun trows at them with the pistol and hit one in the face.Come on guys even a 3 year kid will not buy something like that.
How hard is to make something good when the budget doesn't allow it.
Changing the House and Gardens tour into a Mystery Bus Tour was another problem, since I found it hard to believe that these people selected by Mr. Rafiel would willingly remain when they are visiting places connected to their past which they wanted to keep hidden.
That was Agatha Christie's clever twist, and while I don't mind changes from the source when it made sense, not using the most brilliant part of the story was a bad move and made this movie a weak shell of the book.
It's little more than a generic haunted house tale dressed up with the Amityville banner - and when I say 'dressed up', I mean with the same amount of effort put into making a Kalahari bushman pass for a diving instructor by giving him a snorkel.
(The book was a hans holzer novel) but when they got permission they did not use the amityville style house or anything for that matter!
You might get this off TPB at some point in the future, when there's a dry spell in the winter.
Simon Pegg jilts his pregnant fiancÃ©e at the altar, but comes to regret it five years later when he meets the new man in his ex-girlfriend's life, a successful American hedge fund manager.
Also for man who just had a nail jammed into his foot he isn't limping when he goes to see the Nike people.
It's never said exactly when the next scene takes place but Dennis is walking OK so I'd have to assume its at least 6 or more weeks later (thats how long a broken ankle would stay in plaster).
David schwimmer who was good when his scripts were written for him but how he thought he could write a British comedy when he has never lived here before.
how Simon pegg was able to walk those last 9 miles in about 5 mph while it was still dark and I'm not sure when i was supposed to laugh as its very poorly written with a small poetic plot.
There's no snap, no pizazz, and no chemistry between any of the actors, something that becomes painfully obvious when listening to the awkward stilted commentary track.
However, one corpse looks pretty fresh and when they remove the silver cross-like dagger, he comes to life as a wolf-man and kills them.
It was a neat scene--at least until the end, when the lady spasmodically writhes like a go-go dancer who is magnetized to the wall!!
Paul Naschy is turned into a werewolf when an annoyed Wolfman attacks and bite him .
At such a distance it is easy to forget the impact that Naschy's presence as either Daninsky or his werewolf alter-ego made on the movie-going public when it first appeared (proving obviously popular enough to generate the myriad sequels, or variations on the same theme, which followed) for, even if the monster gets a fair work-out here (scenes from this film were actually lifted outright for the abysmal THE FURY OF THE WOLFMAN [1970]!
The film supposedly delves into the tricky area of older man-younger man relationships when, in fact, the younger man is in his mid-teens and the "older man" is in his early to mid-twenties.
Having never been to Eban's home prior, when Charley is kicked out--albeit briefly--how did he know where to run?
If Eban discovers the spirit that love come before all else, in the face of all adversity, and that this is a good thing, one can't help but wonder what happens to the magical relationship when Charlie passes into adulthood.
A bit later, Bobby Ray -- whose brief acting career never firmly developed a screen persona -- performs an "impossible" gag that would have been inappropriate for Stan Laurel, when he pulls a long stepladder out of a much smaller toolkit.
I was impressed with one unusual camera set-up, when a fat pedestrian's face is dirtied and we see a close-up of his reflection in a hand mirror, rather than his actual face.
We can accept one or two extremely implausible events if the story requires it, but when near-impossible events happen again and again, with a new one each few minutes, credibility crumbles.
The US appear to run the UK police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that CID officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub!
when you are straining and your eyes cant handle it any longer, do some more of these in the dark kills where you really don't see what happened.
I can't detrimentally criticise the performances, I would be wrong to do so, but when a drama is billed as being based on an Agatha Christie novel I expect it to be, and expect to see, just that.
Full of stuff that just doesn't happen in the real world (since when were British police inspectors armed with handguns in shoulder holsters?).
What does it say for British police when helicopters and a number of officers at Snipe's location can't find Snipe's and he manages to evade capture by hiding behind some stairs?
All goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief, Windsor (Charles Dance) is killed, the blame falls at Dial's feet.
It says a lot that by the end the only 'contract' that's keeping you interested is when Snipes's will end with Sony and with it an end to any further sub par EL DVD action films.
But, uh, is it a story when nothing really happens?
It perfectly describes the feeling I had when I watched this film, which is supposed to be four stories about New Yorkers dealing with the trauma brought on by 9/11.
Only when she meets an old friend from the past and sees how he can laugh and care about the little things in life, does she open up to herself to try again at living her life the way she wants to.
Sadly, the characters were paint-by-number and the plots trite (when they existed) and the endings completely predictable.
Can you really believe Geraldine McEwan when she states, "I am Nemesis," in this mystery?
Each character has a seemingly decent, if not "wonderful", life and yet when the film digs deeper you notice all the things that are missing and the voids that are left behind.
Speaking of characters, at the video store, when I saw the cast, I thought, "What an awesome cast!
The beginning, with Peter Gabriel/Afro Celt's "Falling" is promising, but all that promise falls apart when the narrator calls one of the skydivers a "genius" and "modern renaissance man."
Near the end of the movie, when the Noah character has to gather the spinners he seems to know exactly what hes talking about.
The story is infantile, characters performed by the actors all have an IQ of zero, and the producers must've been drunk when they made this.
There is one riveting moment when in the middle of an action scene, the characters discourse on the topic of conscience.
In this conversation, our perception of both Rhames' and Oldman's characters change when we realize that one of the characters is totally without conscience and the other has been driven by the human emotion of guilt.
At the very least, the plot thickens near the end of the movie when we realize that the bad guy (who is a really bad guy and the movie absolutely will leave no questions about that) turns out to have a reason for his actions throughout the movie beyond just being a really bad guy.
The evil was heaped onto Charlie Strom, Gary Oldman's character, so heavily in the first half of the movie that it's difficult for him to escape from underneath the mountain of badness that he is under even when we see the reasons for his actions, but the good guys in particular, are not as good as they seem.
It's as if screenwriter Andrew Kotting has adapted the 19th century novel word for word in some scenes and then forgotten this when he's written his own scenes .
However it's important an audience can relate to characters in a movie and when you've got such despicable genetic mutations as the ones seen here it's difficult to connect with the story especially if you can't understand what's being said   So I've slagged off this movie and I have every right to .
The toy comes in a special box with some rocks, a green globule and a glowing rectangle that turns into stone when their mother, Joely Richardson (TV series "Nip & Tuck") touches it.
The cast of characters have little personality and will probably not appeal to the masses who look for obscure slasher fare, and when they die you could care less or feel little pity.
I guess the most memorable murder sequence will be when Santa starts up the plane while a pilot is working on the engine, the spinning propeller blade chopping him and a female student to pieces.
Then in 1972 his fortunes continued to improve when he was offered the lead role in Wes Craven's cult classic 'The Last House on the Left'.
Even when they uncover the heavily-mutilated body of Ralph the albino gardener, they still refuse to accept that a maniac is trying to cut down the guest list for their Xmas party.
On a side note did anyone else notice the white horse Guttenberg lands in front of when he falls out of the tree hit by lightening (don't ask)?
An (allegedly) accurate account of what happened when heiress Patricia Hearst (Natasha Richardson) was kidnapped by a terrorist group.
I can't really comment on that since I was only 12 when she was kidnapped and knew little about it.
All the "revolutionaires" ideals came across as extremely questionable and I actually started to laugh when Ving Rhames started spouting off about it.
Man, i can't even remember when was the time i saw this... A few years back, that's for sure.
Such a low state of affairs for a movie studio when they try to 'out-Disney' Disney.
There were times, too numerous to count, when the boom mike was in the camera shot.
I can only assume an actor such as Michael SegerstrÃ¶m, one of those who actually performed some acting in this piece, wasn't very proud when he saw the final result.
I'm from the northwest, and would have been 18 when this film was shot....there's lots of folks that have a beer with there kid when they just got outta prison!
This probably sounds very harsh, but when this actress came storming into the home of Ambrose Applejohn, I was just bowled over by how terrible her accents were.
How uplifting is it to watch a clown entertain a room full of cancer victims, old people, sick people, all without hope, and the big laugh comes when he burns it down by mistake?
What a shock when my wife and I ventured out for the new Babe Goes To The City.
Also when compared to original it shines considerably darker ,but by itself it stands firm.
I truly believe these woman had nothing but 15 minutes of fame in mind when doing these shows.
But he himself proved to be just as bad as the girls when he rejected Rachel in his own series.
A humorous moment apparently occurred when Rachel's father walked up to mesh a few weeks after the show had ended and said "you picked the wrong girl!".
Truly a boring spectacle awaits you when you watch this flick...at least for me.
I could've sworn when it's bobbing out of the water it likes to wave (not clawing), asking to jump in so it can hug you to death.
Where's Arnold Schwarzenegger when you need him.
Someone wakes me up when something starts happening.
A herpetologist named Dr. Annie Essex (Kathryn Witt) is doing some research in the hope of finding a new species, she becomes involved with Sheriff Keefer (William Steis) so when the dead, mutilated body of a fisherman (Ramon D'Salva) turns up she goes along, I have no idea why Keefer would involve her but what does that matter?
At first Keefer is somewhat sceptical as is his right as the local law enforcement officer but soon has to change his doubting mind when the bodies continue to pile up & he sees the 'terrifying' creature with his own eyes, it's up to Keefer & Annie to save the local residents from becoming fish-lizard creature food!
However, if you can stay awake long enough there is a scene when a fashion model takes a quick swim topless.
"Demon of Paradise" tells the story of Hawaiian fishing community terrorized by a man sized amphibious monster.I consider myself very tolerant when it comes to rating and reviewing Z-grade trash,unfortunately "Demon of Paradise" is simply dull.There is no gore and the bloodless killings are mostly off-screen.Admittedly Hawaiian landscapes are beautiful and the music is fine,but "Demon of Paradise" is a misfire.4 out of 10 for this low-budget monster dud.
Ashame that the biggest scare was at the beginning, when we get our first close-up of Lizzy, making you hope for more intense scares in the climax.
when in fact, any viewer with any brains knows differently.
"In the Dark" presents itself as "real" footage of the events that take place when a group of teenagers break into an abandoned, burned asylum, where years before, a few of them did *something* (raped?)
It would be so nice if when making a T&A movie, the people responsible would simply make a mindless movie with lots of naked female flesh and leave the really bad film making to Ed Wood.
The audience disbelieves Grace and believes the charming Bing, but it is shown the truth in excellent filmic style, and swings just when Bill Holden does, into trusting Grace.
This is at a time when nuclear power is necessary to our economy.
As for the scene when she holds up the Geiger counter, and says how scarred she is, either by a lie or incompetence, she is using it inaccurately.
Is Dr. Rynning really only 64 years old when he looks like he's 105?
These are the burning questions which will keep you on the edge of your seat when you watch 'Blood of the Horror-' ...
I did not watch this when it started as it seemed to be vulgar and violent in the first few episodes in the bits and pieces I saw.
These Vampires were created when alien Vampires landed on Earth centuries ago from the 'Spectrum Solar System' & that the infamous scientist Dr. Rynning (John Carradine) is heading a space expedition to the 'Spectrum Solar System' to do some research or something, I don't really care as Horror of the Blood Monsters is already as stupid as any film I've seen.
You know it's bad when you find yourself wishing that you were watching the original Filipino caveman movie, without all the stoopid sci-fi claptrap that Adamson & Co. added later.
(I think the scene that really put me off was when she drank out of an aquarium and spit out a beta fish...
Even when the master criminal is unmasked, the audience is forced to say, Who was this guy.
I long for the day when Spain stops making half-baked ripoffs of American hits and starts attempting honest genre movies.
Obviously, the director is trying to advice us, because the film is so bad that when I went out from the theatre I thought: "I shouldn't have come".
They do take on serious subjects, but always bail out when it comes to quality acting and directing, and then go for the "Men are Evil" conclusion.
I saw this on TV when I was about 13 or 14 and loved it.
AIP could only make decent comedies when Roger Corman was at the helm, and this film has good ol' Edward L. Cahn calling the shots, so you know it's going to be formulaic AND boring.
A perfect movie for when your mind is not totally on the movie; such as the drive in theater fare of the late 50s.
Unfortunately, I must have been hibernating somewhere in a deep cave when they did so.
The casting was alright but that girl when she was young lol now that was funny.
The whole movie takes place in an English-Hindi speaking town when Charlie Chaplin movies are releasing.
At first, when I saw Black, I was really impressed with the movie and the way Sanjay Leela Bhansali made it.
Only later did I realize (when I got hold of the DVD cover) that it was made much before Black even started production.
There are moments of pure magic -- like when Noah, the ten-year-old boy, learns sounds can affect how a spider builds its webs, and when Emma, his five-year-old sister, sets the "spinners" going the first time.
Boys tend to jump over each other, verbally, when they're talking; they don't talk, wait for you to talk, then talk.
However, 70 minutes or so into the film, she feels the need to strangle the girl she saved and cut her face off when she reveals she is leaving with the man.
This movie is an inferior remake of "His Girl Friday".I found it to be unfunny and laced with profanity.Where is Cary Grant when you need him?
They even fall asleep when detained by the FBI, allowing their kids to escape into the night.
Their father becomes very proud when Noah presents a magnificent design in the fair of science and technology, and his teacher Larry White (Rainn Wilson) and his mystic wife Naomi Schwartz (Kathryn Hahn) become interested in the boy when he draws a mandala.
And when played out on screen it was so so so predictable.
One scene in particular when the lead actress is captured and thrown into a holding cell.
I only watched this one because I have owned it for so long now when I quit watching the second series of Afterdark films.
What do they do, when one of their own gets killed?
even when he is being slaughter by a retard caveman he hardly even snapped out of his rubbish acting induced coma, they should have smashed that cleaver into his head for real cos nobody would even realise he was gone and those that did clearly would have rejoiced.
Just when you think it's over, you see that there is one cannibal still alive which implies the real horror of a sequel.
you can past that the general conceit of the whole film, America turning into a barren wasteland simply because they used up all the oil, is a straw dog impossibility and if you push aside that character's this stupid and ineffective could survive when nearly 2/3rd of the population have passed on, then this certainly had the capacity to be a fun little flick.
OR b) devise an elaborate plan to get one of your people to infiltrate the group, then wait until nightfall, when the building is plunged into total darkness, and take just one victim, leaving the rest for another night-time visit at a later date?
From last years 8 films to die for this is the story of group of people who have survived after society has collapsed on itself when the gas ran out.
A scrappy group of survivors holes up in a Philly hospital to try and rebuild society, but when their security is threatened by a roving band of cannibals, they must fight "tooth and nail" to survive.
And when one character paints herself up in tribal warpaint, you know it's gone from bad to worse.
Overall, the idea of society collapsing in on itself when the oil supply runs out was a pretty interesting conceit.
This all starts when three from the group find a fallen young woman, Neon(Rachel Miner, of the previous year's "8 films to die for" feature, PENNY DREADFUL)who claims that the cannibals are called Rovers and slaughtered her whole family.
I also felt that it was all too predictable that Victoria would be rescued when she was captured, and then she would be the only one with the brains to overcome the obviously stupid cannibals, which she is able to do through the simple trick of not showing her drugging bodies.
Another dud Australian film, which proves to me , that the quality of Australian films has declined since the good old 1970's & 80's when all the classics were made.
Remember when John Wayne tells the woman that he's a loner, gets on his horse and rides away while she cries and looks pained?
It's a big waste of time, especially when there are so many other movies out there!  
An apotheosis of bad taste comes when a paralytic wants to take a leak, so poppa and momma prop him up while Hugo Dugay is rummaging for his pissing gimmick.
My older daughter's heart was pounding so hard in the middle that when she clutched my hand I could feel it on my upper arm.
These have simply been "translated" for us, where necessary, or conveyed to us "as is" when they still make scatological sense today.
While as a portrayal of a moment in time, time and the world continue after the show ends, no matter when that is, the end of this third season will conclude with only the vague prospect of maybe (and that's a BIG maybe!)
Just when you're starting to enjoy the farcical parts of the movie, BANG!
The story mainly skims and summarizes the plot of Andersen's fairy tale, giving the feel of headline news when compared to the original book.
I really wanted to like this movie, especially when I saw that Patrick Stewart was in the cast as the voice of the raven since I'm a long-time Patrick Stewart fan.
I realize I'm a snob when it comes to "The Snow Queen."
The movie is almost saved when Margie (the hilarious anti-hero of the first film) arrives on the scene and makes Zenon's life a nightmare...unfortunately she becomes Zenon's friend, mistake #3.
But when Stone personally met Noriega, accused the script of being completely untrue.
I laughed once during this movie, when Dr. Meecham (Howard Duff) - heading to the basement of the mansion as the powerful storm strikes - says "It's like the last 10 days of Hitler!"
Rolf may only have been "seventeen going on eighteen", but the future storm-trooper sounds frightfully more mature than Melanie Freeland(Holly Hunter), or Stefania(Stefania Montorso), who is thirty going backwards, when she tells her niece, "I don't want to be a normal, old aunt.
The irony being: the aunt avoids taking any responsibility for the potential ramifications of Megghy's sex adventure, when she acts as a sister figure to her niece, rather than a surrogate mother, who in that capacity, would tell the young girl to wait, before dragging her back on the boat.
It's left to auntie to be the architect of her own doom when she seriously upsets the pooch.
On the acting front, their are just a couple of seconds when you would see some acting on the screen and that is by the warden.
when the leading lady prisoner undresses and approaches her, its the look in her eyes which makes you think that a good actress have been wasted.
Many scenes have no dialog and, when it have, it has no use.
despite the fact he cannot act and when he tries it is just very embarrassing to watch.
If you want to reminisce about television shows from your childhood and have a warm loving tone when you do so, then you can definitely find better ones than this load of rubbish.
I find that when me and my mates will discuss these shows the A-Team will always be referred to as our favorite where we will mimic characters and talk about particular shows.
Example : Delon and Belmondo do not know each other, but when they take their weapons for the gunfight (in an arsenal worthy of Saddam Hussein in his best days), they joke about an hypothetic "good old time" when they obviously have met... Another example : everyone knows that a latex ball (you know, the kind your dog likes to bite) is the perfect tool to steal a Mercedes or a BMW : just push it hardly, it's magic, forget the keys !!!
But the real problem is we were serious when we made it.
It brings its own array of bizarre characters and situations, mixing them with the locals, and then takes them away again just as quickly, until next year when some of them come back for more.
It delights as well as gives special meaning to putting a level of belief in what is unknown at a time when the rest of the world relies on hard facts and rigid control of personality.
It struck me less as a study of two otherwise decent men under pressure than an entirely predictable account of what might happen when an alcoholic chaos addict meets a shyster lawyer.
how dumb, come on people... i can't see this is a funny show at all, i even watched a million little fibers episode and it was not funny at all... they didn't respect Oprah's character and they made fun of her, i just wonder why we laugh to something while other's cry when they watch it... u know y i cried simply because media shows Americans and the whole world another face of Islam...a face they created especially for them.
The plots all involved him trying to trick people into giving him money or trying to trick women into sleeping with him or usually both of those things, all he did was con people and it always backfired because he was very bad at it and thought he was a lot smarter than everyone else when he wasn't.
I had already a bad feeling about this affair,when I watched the crappy trailer.
Especially when watching a parody movie I expect a hilarious firework of jokes without any pauses and not some small firecrackers burning down once in a while.
Good that they had Tanya (Kathryn Taylor, Miss Kansas USA) along to handle the cop when they got a speeding ticket.
Sorry about writing in CAPS earlier, I just thought it might be funny if the director saw that and got excited, then was let down when he read the rest.
This is a shame, because this movie does have a couple of nice scenes (when the crew doesn't go wild with the camera, that is).
I'll probably go see this again when it does open.
My theory is that when they read the script they couldn't help but fall asleep.
Who hires a director for a sequel when he disliked the original?
And that was when the first cracks in the band's image as a band of the people, only out there to provide alternatives, appeared.
So when one sits down to view Some Kind Of Monster with those facts in mind, it only further exposes what a bunch of ignorant, spoiled children Metallica really are.
The party with the most responsibility for the fact that the party is now over stares them in the face every day when they look in a mirror.
The latter because he speaks the mind of every truly musical person on the planet when Lars plays him the track the band is thinking of opening the new album with, by telling Lars quite plainly that he would throw it in the trash, never to be heard again.
And when I picked this game up I immediatly disliked it.
I bought it just to see Raven de la Croix as I remember seeing this when a youngster and her being this incredible figure of white on a horse (white star is her character name).
Unfortunately the film is only a 15 so there's no real sex but the image of Raven in some kind of very short, dream state when she has a snake draped round her neck is mind bendingly erotic and worthy of the purchase price.
While they were young in the 80s and beginning of the 90s they did not enjoy too much success, and it can be said that their legend and influence started to build only at the moment when they split.
There are parts which would entice self harm it was that bad.There was  one really good scene when the boy runs away,run run with him.
On the other side of the spectrum is Peter, a low-life hit-man (Mickey Rourke, fresh from his award winning turn in "The Wrestler")  The biggest flaw is the film's trying (in vain) to make the movie adaptation (somewhat) cohesive when the book was anything but.
Director Gregor Jordan's filmography is getting progressively worse since the amazing Two Hands, which was made back when he had little money to work with, away from big Hollywood influences.
The only good part about this movie is when it shows Amber Heard naked, but after those few scenes the rest of it is some more shallow and boring stuff.
And that's really disappointing, because when I first heard about it, before there was a trailer, before the characters were nailed down, when they were still talking about one of the Olsen sisters as an actress, I was thinking this film was going to be great.
Don't pretend you have said something when you haven't yet.
Now I am not a person who goes to films to see naked women (a little to old to make that the priority and was unaware of this one), but when the movie was over all I could think was "at least Amber Heard was naked / half-naked a lot and she looked good!"
But its sad when you leave a film thinking "where was the story" and you know you will only remember the girl who looked good in "THAT FILM" cause the title and film itself will be forgotten quickly!
And make sure the next time you sell your story to Hollywood to get paid enough money so you can take it a little easier when the "Filmmakers" butcher your work (who likely did not want you interfering with them cause THEY know how to make films, not some writer)!
I watched it when it premiered on TV out of a lack of anything better to do.
And many of the scenes are simply painful in memory (like the bad-guy speech right when he is prepared to kill an aging Robin, which gives the secondary hero an opportunity to regain his sword.
It's a re-watch indeed, but I don't remember ANYTHING from when I first saw it a couple of years back on TV so I decided to re-watch it again.
Well, when most of actors are from the family, the best actors from this movie are then the American secondary actors.
when the old actress (director's wife) forgets her lines.
For sheer stupidity, nothing equals the moments (several of them) when hero and villain could easily kill or at least maim each other, but simply don't.
This is one to avoid.The premise sounds interesting and as a film it owes much of its plot theme to David Finchers infinitely superior Se7en.Its an uncomfortable film to watch for all the wrong reasons.The characters are badly realised and the cop on the trail has to be the worst cop ever for the some of the situations he gets himself into.This is a film that will appeal to people when they read the back of the DVD in the rental store but upon putting the disc in your machine you'll realise why you hadn't heard of it before you came across it in the store.Its,save the odd moment,pretty rubbish stuff really and deserves its place in the bargain bin.Watch it you must be don't say i didn't warn you.4/10
It is often the case when reviewing that it is more enjoyable to write about bad 'art'.
Were they all on 'ludes when they edited this section?
Picasso and Modigliani were spinning in their graves when this pretentious insult to their memory was made!
The couple dancing in the dark at night in the street, the little boy (Modigliani as child), Picasso being the first one to recognize Modi's talent (He applauds first), the punchline "I 'll paint your eyes when I know your soul"...I'm pretty sure the director lost a bet and had to include as many clichÃ©s as possible.
What a terrible actress...especially when she screams.
What this film delivers is a rather annoying portrait of a young consumptive artist who drank and drugged himself to death at a moment in his career when renown was just beginning.
Destiny just practically copied everything from Seed, except doing them backwards, rather than the ZAFT steals EA's mobile suits at the beginning of the season, this time is the opposite...and ZAFT have shitty mobile suits this season, the only fights that are worth seeing is when Kira kicks ass with Gundam Freedom, and later on both Kira and Athrun kick ass with their Infinite Justice and Strike Freedom.
My first true experience with Gundam was through the Wing series when it was shown in the US via Cartoon Network.
Why make a lead character (who had an actually good story to tell) along with a set of new characters when their next step is to shine the spotlight on the old set of characters?
Unfortunately, the director, Travis Irvine, fails to understand that true comedy works when it is taken seriously.
I, however, haven't done that stuff in a long time so I was merely envisioning putting this one straight into the trade-in pile when I was done watching it.
To see big stars (Rose Marie from the Dick Van Dyke Show and David Hasselhoff) in our little meccha is unreal, especially when you see that Rose Marie is the owner of the hotel at the edge of town.
This film is one for the history books, and if you had the opportunity to see this film on NBC when it first aired, you would have probably seen the Apple Computer "1984" commercials a few times too.
However, he runs into even more pressure when he gets on the trail of a serial murderer who slays in exactly the same fashion as the notorious 19th century London killer.
She also falls in like with a young man and then creates a scene in a library when he won't just drop everything and have sex with her.
By the way, I could not believe in my eyes when u guys rate this movie 7.5 stars.
Failing to show the audience the couple's relationship when it was good before showing its collapse and the shallowness and incomprehensible decisions of both of them left me with no one to root for, nothing left to do but ask, repeatedly, "what the hell is wrong with these people?"
This is perhaps the finest example of how much trouble happens when the Odyssey runs the community.
OK really my comprehension of the film totally broke down when it got to the point that I didn't know whether it was the cafe girl or the original girl post surgery who was making his life miserable at about midpoint... sigh... all the while I just wanted him for myself to take him away from this witchy world in which these horrible women were there to make him so unhappy.
at one point (forgive my non chron account) he even agrees to see this one girl who is not very pretty and who kind of masochistically insists on making it very clear that he doesn't really like her, in spite of which though of course because there is something seriously wrong with this guy he's willing to be with her...in fact when she's shooting a gun it really makes him think she looks "awesome" OK sure why not, look on the bright side why don't you.
when the girl shows up with her old face pasted over her new one, I"m confused as to whether this is cafe girl or original girl... OK maybe Asian womens' faces don't make as strong an impression on me as they might .... but it seemed to me that it was in fact the cafe girl who stole the photo and cut it out and so would be wearing it... unless somehow it got into the hands of the surgery gal.
and so it seemed to me that it was cafe girl at the denouement... when boy gets we guess killed, or at least properly mangled, whatever he looked like at the end of the movie...he certainly looks worse off after his big car accident.
I heard the director had a few issues with Koreeans when he made this movie, because he is believed to portray his country in dark colors.
What does it say about a movie when the most generous adjective I can come up with to describe it is "watchable"?
And neither man has any moral issues when it comes to stealing from their neighbors, thereby helping to maintain the status quo of poverty.
I honestly don't understand what was going through Scott Alexander and Larry Kawazinky's heads when they wrote and directed this piece of drivel.
There's no gore here except one scene when the corrupt Sheriff has a root enter his mouth & exit through his eye socket...  Technically this is alright, forget about the continuity mistakes, it's quite well made & beats hands down many low budget horror films that are made these days.
One gets stranded at a small gas station, while the other is returning to her small town home after having left it and her fiancÃ© when she was in high school.
Why the roots would stop attacking, or why they would die, when the barrels are carted away or further buried is entirely unclear.
when it shouldn't matter and isn't something that should be bothersome or a mystery.
Why don't they just ask if the "Jaws" music is played when a big shark is swimming near you.
Why sit through this kind of drivel when you can watch the original "All That Heaven Allows".
It's very depressing when you come out of the theater more subdued than when you went in, and this movie will do that to you.
And he's surprised when his fellow Blacks shower him with the same one-dimensional hatred that all of Kathleen's friends shower upon her?
Possibly too high, particularly when Hollywood is producing poor quality films aimed simply at getting butts on seats.
People have compared this movie to the excellent "The Princess Bride" but as a slightly jaded and cynical viewer, I'd have to argue that "The Princess Bride" is a lot more enjoyable in every single aspect (swordfights - I weep when I even compare the two, dialogue, plot, characters, and just overall silliness) when compared to this movie.
This movie is sooooooo bad.....but that part when the bad guys are torturing Lou-Z and start cutting up his toupee is just too funny--I could not stop laughing!!
How can our air and water be killing us when we are thriving on it and living longer and healthier than ever?
How can ours be the path to over-population when the populations of industrialized nations are either steady or slightly decreasing?
Why aren't the unindustrialized, third-world nations a threat when their populations are increasing exponentially?
One thing that is highly irritating throughout the film is that the actors are always laughing or have big smiles on their faces when there is nothing funny going on.
It appears that the writers did not have their wits about them when they were attempting to develop a plot.
Guess he became that way by being such a whiny, angst-ridden little runt when younger, as "Tudors" would have you believe.
The very name of the series is a lie Â how can it be about "the Tudors" when it ignores Owain Twdwr and barely mentions Henry VII?
I had hopes, when I first heard that this series was coming out, that it would have the good sense to dramatize the background to Henry VIII's reign.
You know you are watching trash when the characters keep jumping in bed to keep you interested.
But when Henry looks like he's in his 20s and Katherine of Aragon looks old enough to be his mom, this makes me annoyed.
He wasn't a child when he died, either.
I have nothing against either of the two, but when you push everything into the background to make Henry's sexual escapades your sole focus, most of your plot ends up seeming irrelevant, a filler.
For example, Henry was 40 when he met Anne Boleyn (20 at the time) and pressed to produce a male heir to secure the continuation of the young Tudor line (he was only the second Tudor on the throne.)
There are a couple of slug fest scenes between cops and the mob, with kicks to the ribs when someone is down, heads bumped into walls, etc.
The producers ( One of whom is Martin Scorsese ) might think they're making a movie for everyone but I promise if you like one aspect of how the movie plays out you'll also be very irritated by the other aspects and when you make a movie with something for everyone you're in serious danger of making a movie with something for no one
Some people say an actor acts "effortlessly:" when he gives a good performance, however in Deniro's case that seems to be opposite as their is hardly any acting all.
A cop who despite his own morals decides to break them when it suits em, doesnt obviously appeal to me or audience.
He has the right attitude but the wrong delivery - when Allen is acting with body language he's great, but when he opens his mouth he manages to overdo the already trite dialogue even further.
The plot is incredulous at best but when it has holes in it there isn't much left.
Eventually a scrap of paper turns-up amongst his effects; but beyond that he seems to have kept no records beyond whatever he might have carried on his person when he was killed.
Perhaps she looks forward to telling him about it when he gets home.
The irony of the first legendary "POTA" movie was that everyone had to object to the way the humans were treated, when we did just as bad or far worse to our captive animals.
Rating 4/10  As a science fiction fan, I can easily suspend disbelief about various scientific concepts (ie: intelligently evolved apes travel back in time and conceive a child(chimp), force-field doors, etc...) However, when various common sense concepts and human behavior are flawed it usually ruins the movie for me.
Scenes that take place in Provinceown, when they first live together, rival similar scenes in Love Story and carry the naturalness of the escaped lobster scene in Annie Hall.
Bishop told us that he was about to begin directing a Quentin Tarantino produced biker film and that he hoped to bring Christopher Jones back to the big screen, as he did when directing Mad Dog Time.
The film they screened was in pristine condition until the last two or three reels, when much of the color had faded so that everything had a pink tone.
It is without doubt the most realistic portrayal of the West and sometimes this can be annoying, for instance when Wild Bill Hickock is shot dead I was furious at how easily it was done but that would be how it was.
The most moving moments to me are a toss up between the confrontation between Dan Dority and doc Cochran over Sofia Metz or one single moment when Swearengen watches Reverand Smith mad ranting from the balcony with a tear in his eye.
The acting is so dry that I found my self falling asleep in my chair when I should have been jumping out of it.
But dear reader, trust me when I tell you that this movie is one fat BUST and if you decide to waste your time and dollars on it, you can't say you haven't been forewarned!
Lets put it this way, when I returned this movie one of the employees gave me a free rental after "Over" apologizing for allowing me to rent it in the fist place.
I was about 15 years old when I saw this movie, in 1969, I think.
), dumped by the boyfriend (for the company of the day drinking town hooligan; a guy that hangs out across the street from the hotel and flips off the manager when confronted - oooooh....scary), and a sweltering shiner (beware of the dangerous library book).
Believe me when I say I am making this movie sound better than it is.
My dad and I were at the local video store trying to find something to rent when we saw this.
A college-campus Casanova (Jones, who looks a bit like James Dean) keeps three girlfriends at the same time, and when they find out about each other they lock him up in an attic, where they take "revenge" on him by alternately having sex with him - thereby draining him of his energy, will-power, or something like that...
God knows what those semi-literate Hollywood bozos had in their tiny little heads when they made this... (Well, apart from trying to make money.)
I was a little young when I watched it, but still, it was entertaining.
I was mislead into watching this piece of garbage when I spotted the cover at a local Hollywood Video rental store.
The good: the first two minutes of the movie, when I thought this is going to be a reality style horror movie shot on video instead of film.
The directing is amateurish and so is the camera work, especially halfway thorogh the movie when the camera-person decided to play with the zoom lens.
The scariest part of the movie was when I knew there was going to be a ghost in the shower, that guy was freaking creepy looking.
I'll admit that I did like this movie when it first came out, but I've since graduated from Junior High.
While watching it, I couldn't figure out when it was made, who was in it or why it was made.
I'm sure the Japanese producers and censors have a lot of fun when they see what has Takashi done now!
and other bloody carnage that gives the makers an opportunity to throw in plenty of blood geysirs and splatter that satisfies some viewers but is not enough when the film is by talented director like Miike.
Neither this or Ichi the Killer are to be taken seriously (hardly anyone takes, at least Full Metal Yakuza), and especially Ichi, despite its flaws and negative sides, tells something about the audience, that laughs looking like a bunch of monkeys and as sorry characters as those inside the film, when someone's being tortured and brutally murdered.
There's not much story to it at all, except that a lowly gangster gets gunned down when his mentor, a yakuza previously in jail for 7 years, gets out and gets killed too.
Not that there aren't any other "special" modifications too, like in the groin area to be precise (not just quick blue electrical flashes go through when he gets charged up).
Then the exploitation-fun continues, as the bare plot wheels away until I couldn't really care less about whatever really happened with most of the characters, and just wondered when the next big huge violent gush of blood would occur.
I believe something like that really happened, but there's so little hint of it earlier in the movie that it's just confusing when it happens.
But then again, who cares about that when the movie is a total waste of your almost 2 hours, hours that will NEVER come back.
I just caught this film when I was away on holiday and being a martial arts movie fan I thought I'd check it out, but I have to say it was diabolical.
He's fortunate most of the time not to be exposed since he's done little research to pull off his deceptions and in one instance is unmasked when he accepts credit for a film most people know he didn't make.
it seemed to me like they filmed several separate "incidents" that they found funny, then remembered that films are supposed to have plots, so they threw in one scene introducing his roommate as some guy smoking pot on his couch, and then we were expected to have an emotional reaction later on in the hospital scene when he's there and malkovich is pretending not to recognize him?
as kids story's go,this ones no different-something happens,hero has to fix it(save/find/insert relevant problem here),has abit of trouble on way but alls OK in end-that much am pretty sure can give away without being accused of mentioning spoilers,in fact that could probably describe any child orientated film.If your kids like animated movies,this will make them happy regardless what i think.On other hand though,if they expect anything different on the animation front,they will be disappointed-most of the animation could have been done just as decent(or badly,depending on point of view,) in the 50's,in fact it looks like they may even have had that in mind intentionally when they made it for all i know.
You must wonder about the intelligence of TV viewers during the seventies when this gibberish was on top.
But who could give a good performance when asked to do mindless garbage like this?
I felt sad for the white chick (grilfriend), not because of her colour, but as a women I could relate, when you think you know somebody but and realising that you don't and in such a matter is just so painful....., but on another hand....there was that element for me, of our black brothers going for white chicks... when they are loaded....even though in this movie that wasn't what brought them together.... interesting story indeed...
Our dreams, when they shatter and fade painfully silently and the dark talents we discover in desperation for a moment to live the life we once aspired to.
Perhaps when it debuted in 1939 people knew nothing of Vietnam--this is the only way I can explain the insane casting of the Viennese Hedy Lamar as a woman who is half Vietnamese!
If I were to rate this film based on my memories of it when I was ten years old, it would be a straight nine out of ten.
She only gets naked once and when she finally does drop the dress it's far from mind blowing.
An alcoholic ex-cop private investigator is hired by a friend of the model to investigate it as a murder when the police decide it was a suicide.
"when a thug or goon he runs into calls him an S.O.B.
With only a passing reference to Tim, the main character in the first Boogeyman, this film should not be classified as a sequel because when a second (or third) film in a series is made, there should be something there to make a positive connection.
The actors and directing is OK i suppose but whats the point of watching a sequel to a horror when its basically a completely different film and genre.
This is not what you would expect when you see the front cover of the DVD.
I hope the fans of him were just and p**sed off as I was about Van Damme, when he was dumped from the series.
...........sadly this film is not it.While I admit to watching this film several times,I really think that like most sequels to stand alone movies it suffers from lack of a good plot device,when the main character of the first movie is conveniently disposed of in flash back and quite easily at that and a new hero is introduced as a previously unmentioned brother you know that you are in trouble.
I'm also curious as to why every couple in this film invented reasons why they should stay together, when clearly there exists no believable chemistry.
It must have been a slow year at Sundance when "Myth of Fingerprints" slipped through with such shining notices (and, for God's sake, how did he assemble THAT cast?
Even when I watch a bad film I can normally guess what the director was trying to do, even if he/she failed... but here.... nothing, it's just totally pointless.
Not too mention the non-humour of most of the "funny" parts (like when they are picking on the foreign fellow).
It's a dangerous life and when armed rivals steal their taxi, Lucky decides to return to crime.
), self-centered jerk who only acts like a decent person when his girlfriend Elaine (a cute and perky Maggie Gyllenhaal) rightfully leaves him.
(I started applauding when Duchovny tells Billy Crudup's character to shut the hell up.
I did understand what Jay meant when he said, "You know, I wish I had your heart.
I kept (back in 1999 when I first saw this movie) seeing a mad Ross trying to be bad whenever I looked at him, but now looking back on it and putting Ross out of my head (I really dislike the show anyway), Schwimmer does an effective job... however he doesn't really have dimensions and depth.
I don't want to over do it with the praise, but when you can't recognize an actor from role to role, you KNOW he's good.
A certain scene when the director and his assistant meet the man who wants to produce the movie is rather hysterical.
Embellishments don't take you far when it comes to poetic drama if the raga happens to be not in sync with the rasa.
It doesn't build (except a viewers annoyance) and when the final twist arrives, the movie finally offers viewers some mercy and arbitrarily ends it there; but calling it quits forty minutes earlier would have been just dandy.
I had never heard of the movie before but when they showed it on TV it had a great review and since I like everybody from the Friends cast very much I thought let's give it a try.
I overuse the metaphor in my reviews, but a movie this unoriginal is like a joke you heard in kindergarten and then someone tries to make you laugh at that joke when you're 80-years-old.
People will defend it by saying, "There was nothing like it when it came out!"
We have to believe the film is going one way, when it is actually going another.
I even know exactly when the film started going astray.
Worse, is when the other character does so.
Why can't the producers hire some decent writers, I know you are supposed to suspend your belief when watching horror movies but it would be nice to see a more believable plot and maybe a few better written characters.
It's got be insulting to the Afro-American community when they are mostly portrayed as Jive talking, foul mouthed and overly horny people in this type of movie.
What the hell were they thinking when they came up with this one?
In one seen, that I think is incredibly stupid, Jennifer's character is in a tanning machine when the psychotic Gordon's fisherman locks her in with one of those cable ties and turns the machine to full blast.
As stupid as her friends are, they waste time breaking the machine when they could simply pull the plug.
The first one was good, but what the hell happened when they made this one.
How scary is it when a man runs around (or should I say, WALKS around) and kills characters that only have 2 lines, or less.
I Know What I Did Last Summer when I watched this movie...
But when they get on the island, it's rain season, and as the killer murders... people we don't give a darn about (which could very well mean any character), including a scary rastafarian Mary Jane smoker (Jack Black?
Why didn't Julie ax Ben Willis when he was trying to break through the door?
If you're ever stuck in a slasher situation, KILL the murderer when you get chance, and use a bit of logic.
Mr. Garrett drinks Budweiser beer when he goes out to pick up women.
It makes the movie kind of pathetic when it could have been excellent entertainment.
U know the old construction set for kids, as most of the movie was about struggle against the toys many of us was building when really young.
So when Robinson puts together a new mob and starts warring on Bogart, he shouldn't have been surprised when Bogart takes him for that last ride.
And when Sothern is the one who sets him up, what's there to say.
Robinson and Bogart are always great when they get together.
is pretty far from the first thought that comes to mind when seeing that).
It's classified as a "reality TV program" when in fact Pauly Shore himself admitted a great deal of it is written because he is bored by reality TV.
The show also suffers from more than a tinge of "Providence" syndrome - the heroine is SOOO perfect (albeit in a "bad girl" way), almost always right when she bucks the system (except for a few "very special" plots where she makes a mistake and Learns Something About Herself), and every man is in love with her.
Ah yes, Santa Inc is corporate and has silly contractual obligations that would put Kattan's elf with delusions of grandeur into position as a potential substitute Extreme Santa when said CEO considers taking the year off.
( I was saving that for when the US was nuked ah la Jericho, but this is worse... far worse).
I could go on, but I keep twitching when I think of the movie.
If you've ever seen the first one, you will understand when I say: STOP RUINING A GOOD THING, Hollywood!
You had to have known what a junk-fest this was going to be when you saw the script.
I was actually fortunate enough to watch part of the filming of this movie in Natchitoches, LA and never would have believed how bad it was when it hit the screen.
You know you are in trouble when a film includes John Goodman, Eddie Griffin, Harvey Firestein and Michael McKean (and a scene-stealing Carol Kane) and is still dull.
I was excited to see John Goodman as Santa, but he wasn't weary enough in the scenes where Santa is weary, and certainly wasn't jolly enough when Saint Nick needed to be his old self.
Where's the Burgermeister when you need something burned?
I think that these horror movies have turned quite a bit more non-scary when I stopped smoking hashish and weed prior to the experience few years ago.
It is very difficult to get scared when the wig moves around like it is some sort of pet!
I'd have to say I was very disappointed when the guy who questions the motives on America's war on Iraq turns up to do his bit to fight for his country.
Basically, a film is bounded to fail, when the story does not work, nothing really tend to happen and along with fail performances from the leads.
While it is interesting to think about the prospect, the filmmaker fails to add an human touch to the proceeding and the effect is by the 45 minutes mark, the audience is looking at their watches, thinking, when is this film going to end.
i assure it is not.IF the subject matter would been different and not propagandistic i would give this production a 6-7 due to good acting but slower towards the end( another observation point i have in spotting propaganda; when the movie slows down towards end to make sure your sentiments and feelings can properly have a meltdown, get you to sleep, hypnotize, and make your dreams play the role of influencing your conscious when waking up).
and sega puts tails together with a female plant called cosmo who adds nothing to the series when he should be with cream.
and Cream comments on a game of catch in such an awkward, mangled fashion I was on the floor laughing), often for no reason, but that actually makes things entertaining, as you never know when he's going to do it next.
Don't get me wrong, I'm extremely happy that they made a new show in 9 years (I was 15 when this first aired) I believe.
Oh yes, the action scenes, well i don't know what passed through Woo's head when he decided to show half of the film in slow motion.
I used to be a fan when he put the moviegoing audience first and he gave us some great actioners when he first arrived in Hollywood (e.g.
The gimmick, with the masks IS cute and would be a nice addition to a movie, which contained some real intrigue, however when it is as over-used, as in this film, it is only silly.
How is it that his bike doesn't explode when his gas tank is hit but everything he shoots blows up?
Being a tomboy, I absolutely hate it when women in movies have no personality and are just added in as a love interest.
The script seems to be written as an inside-joke, but it's hard to laugh when the actors on-screen are humiliated (and in such a lifeless vacuum).
None pose much of a threat and are easily disposed of when the time comes.
But I don't particularly like it when movies fail to entertain me, as "Bloodeaters" did.
There is not a large amount of gore, unlike what the box lead me to believe, and when gore is inserted, it is extremely fake.
With that said, amazingly enough I WOULD recommend Blood Lake to any SERIOUS horror movie fan, if only to see the good old days of the horror genre, when a films like this could get made.
None of the characters are particularly interesting and you won't feel any sympathy when they die.
The decent bits are when a man gets his hand severed, complete with spurting blood, and a few splatter scenes such as when one of the zombies is killed at the end.
What irritates me even more is that when 'Double the Fist', one of the all time greatest Australian TV shows ever made won the AFI for best comedy beating this show, every newspaper article afterwards winged about how this got it's arse kicked by a more deserving show.
One of my pet peeves is when a film features a song clearly written by an older songwriter with a background in show tunes and the like, and tries to pass it off as a big pop hit.
It annoys most horribly when it could have entertained us at least a little bit.
The scene is of course when Buffy and Spike are talking at the end of the battle, and Buffy reaches for Spike's hand, their hands embrace and a magic flame bursts out from their hands, in my interpretation; "the flame of love".
And I'm almost crying of joy and the intensity of the moment, only to get a "slap" in the face 2 seconds later, when Spike replies; "No, you don't...
Xander is also very indifferent when he hears of Anya, the love of his life's death.
At the end, when the survivors are standing around, looking at the big hole in the ground, not much is cleared out.
I was devastated when the episode ended.
I never watched it on TV because when the Buffy movie came out, I hated it (of course, a lot has changed since then).
I even began to get Willow-y when I talked at times haha.
I had a lot of problems with this episode, but one thing I did like was the Spike and Buffy scene (even though I never wanted them together, esp after he turned stalker-y and built a mannequin and a sex-bot, sniffing her undies...etc) I didn't understand why the spell had to turn all potentials worldwide into all out slayers when the major battle was in the school.
5 was the best ending when they planned to end it the first time.
I watched the film hoping for redemptive quality; instead, I stopped the film when they kissed passionately because it was evident that the plot progressed beyond the point of no return.
I draw the line with entertainment that includes adult and under-aged sex even when it's packaged as a lesbian love story.
If Simone were driven merely by flattery and lust, then the coupling might seem understandable, but the story seems to go out of its way to show that there is a deeper connection between the two, one that drives the poised, thoughtful and otherwise careful Simone to throw caution to the wind and bed down with jail bait when it isn't even clear that she was able to do the same with a woman she knew for years and loved.
I think the only scene that moved me was when Simone was in church speaking to the priest.
Well i'm stretching to meet the 10 minimum line requirement, which is hard to do when dealing with ultra-crappy short films.
There is one funny part in this film and that is when Will Smith tells Whoopi there is a white man at the door.
My favorite scene in the movie is when Whoopie Goldberg and the guy from "Three Men and a Little Lady" go to a Japanese restaurant and Whoopie Goldberg takes a whole gulp of Wasabie, that's the only funny scene in the whole movie, trust me.
The movie is characterized by feedbacks of Irena's past, when she was a prostitute, forced to have children and sell them.
The one that sticks in the front of my mind is when Peck lets the poodle out of the bedroom where he is hiding from his wife (Bacall) with his shoe in its mouth.
By the time the film is finished one knows no more about these characters and how they feel about anything or what their hopes, dreams and heartbreaks are then when we first meet them.
It was a face that I grew so tired of by the end of the film, that I dearly wished the wicked and capricious (per Chevalier's fictional interpretation)Catherina would have given it a good slap when she went all out in her tirade in the final scenes.
There are long sequences in which absolutely nothing happens (when I say "nothing" I mean nothing).
My two roommates and I were totally pumped up to see this film, we set a timer on the TV and all ran into the living room when the timer went off and sat attentively on the couch like dogs about to be fed.
Ironically, director Apted misses few opportunities to denude his leading lady, but when the story conspires a reason for the strapping Neeson to shed his clothes, tellingly Apted suddenly becomes coy with showing nudity.
To betray these traits is offensive to me when there aren't many others who could have held a candle to him and most likely never will.
Actually, when I first saw `Portrait of Serial Killer' (at much younger age than generally recommended) and not knowing who Rooker was, I really was convinced he was a real madman!
There were some good parts though, such as when they zap people with Orgazmo's working gun, (especially the dog, I got a kick out of that), and a few other scenes.
Essentially the film is a kick in the face to religion and caused a lot of controversy when it was released.
The only other thing this movie has going for it is cameos by a number of real-life porn stars; but when there's not so much as a bare breast on display, what on earth is the point ?
So, when you hear that Trey Parker of South Park fame wrote, directed and starred in a comedy set in the world of porn you had to think this would be a movie that had the potential to be excruciatingly bad.
My life was never the same...(until of course I saw Jaws 4 when in fact it was 'exactly' the same as when watching this!)
Sound of wind didn't match very light snowfall;hardly any snow falling which undermined the isolation one is supposed to feel.3.Very cold outside but no steam when they spoke?4.What did they not turn on the car heater?5.How could the battery last so long with the lights on?6.The guy early on mentions somethings spooky; i.e.
But showing his insight, no footprints are ever mentioned when the 'ghosts' appear repeatedly.7.Though in real life not too far removed from a college-aged kid, E. Blunt appears a decade older than the character she's playing.8.Overuse, with little payoff, of spectral figures fleeting by.9.Why not start walking back on road they just drove on?
Whats funny is that Reese Witherspoon is billed as a main character, she is on the cover of the DVD box but she is hardly in the movie, and when she is on screen she shows what talent she does have, but how much of it is wasted.
The only other movie I have seen Mr. Connolly in was an old Columbo episode where he was caught partially by the evidence of him marking the rum bottle with his thumbnail so he would know when he had enough.
It's become his calling card now -- it's like the first thing he says when he walks on camera is "You talking' to me?"
Cartoon characters Bullwinkle Moose (voice of Keith Scott, who is also the voice of the narrator) and Rocket J. Squirrel (voice of June Foray) are yanked out of their endless re-runs by perky, hopeless FBI agent Karen Sympathy (Piper Perabo) in order to combat their arch-enemies, Boris (Jason Alexander), Natasha (Rene Russo) and Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro) when THEY are brought out into the real world.
To begin I cant really say I am the best person to judge a movie from all directions and then I mean by acting, script, directing and so forth, but I can say when I see a bad movie and this is 1 of them.
But I am sure I would have liked the movie when I was a kid so maybe there is still hope for this movie for some age group but for those that are older then 14 or around that age and know the movie culture at some level will see those many flaws is this flick.
In fact the costumes and overall quality of the movie is so low, that when we starting to watch this movie, I freaked out a little: I thought I'd mistakenly put on a porn flick.
Hell I was in a movie when I was 4, in Europe.
I'm sorry but I now a good movie when I see one, and yours are not.
It was when Long John Silver (Lance) tells one of his crew that he would "put a bullet" in his head, and there is no way that a pirate would refer to a pistol ball as a bullet.
i was about to wager that Asylum Home Entertainment was a company trying to break in to mainstream producing, when i noticed comments elsewhere that it appears their M.O.
You know you're onto a winner when the same location (in this case, the treasure island of the title) is described on separate occasions as being, 'hidden in the bowels of Satan' AND 'the devil's playground'.
1 finger when you're unconvinced by a CGI insect, 2 fingers when someone inexplicably gets shot, and 3 when the camera deliberately repositions for the best angle of our leading lady's bosoms.
The acting seemed contrived (example is the scene when Jane is being spanked... the crying is so fake).
Just when you think we're coming out of the Dark Ages, along comes a film like this one ready to fling us back about 500 years or so.
Sometimes when i hear a bad review about a horror movie, I just blow it off because I like to experiene the movie myself, but this time I should have taken the advice.
He says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his father's job.
Beware a Michaelangelo-inspired visual motif towards the end when Soderbergh really begins channeling the spirit of Stanley Kubrick.
The dialog was a hoot: when Judy wails "I want to be with you.
Hitler himself fought in the war and was lying in hospital when the war ended and all these factors had far more importance in the creation of Nazi Germany than Hitler's father being a civil servant .
It's so amusing that I burst out laughing when someone made the very predictable cry of " Help get a doctor " - " I am a doctor you idiot "
Characters act in totally unbelievable ways (the famous nazi hunter isn't the least bit interested when somebody tells him about a serious nazi plot, the apparently calm and sophisticated Dr. Mengele nearly strangles somebody to death for no reason) and just about everything else, up to the overly dramatic score, is exaggerated.
The only interesting scene was at the end when Olivier shakes hands with a clone.
It's a tossup; Peck's attempt at a German accent was not outdone in hilarity for almost twenty years, when Brad Pitt in "Seven Years in Tibet" seemed to use it a model and outdid himself.
When a young lower class black fellow from the ghetto,who aspires to be a journalist,wants to meet his idol,a black tv newsman while that tv news reporter is at a crime scene,and then when that same older classy black tv reporter,who turns down the young man's offer to see a video of the young man's work,gets killed in an accident while at the crime scene,the young black fellow takes his place reporting from the crime scene and becomes a hit with local viewers and the tv station and its' news producer.Such is the story of Dexter Jackson in the 1991 film Livin'Large,about a young black man who learns that despite the rewards of fame and money to never forget where you come.
Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student.
So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego.
There are so many low points in this movie, I would be cruel to list them all, but the worst is when all the main characters are swimming nude, and they stand up in shallow water to greet the monk...we are forced to view their saggy, pudgy naked behinds and trust me, it's not a pretty moment.
There are so many other movies and plays that have handled this topic with better grace, even when showing middle-aged men behaving badly.
For example when they were spoofing the famous scene in "Goodfellas" where Joe Pesci gives that "Do you think I'm funny?"
Compared to this, "Mafia" is actually a fine film (and I hated it when it came out!)
The biggest disappointment is when the screen says "The End" and its not over, there are 20 MORE MINUTES!!!!
But of course when all you have is this kind of drivel, that's the only thing you can resort to to pretend what you're showing is actually funny.
"Aideista parhain" is about the unexamined feelings between Eero and his mother Kirsti during the period of their severed existences, in which both parties are forced to revisit when the former "war child" returns to Sweden for the funeral of his foster mother, breaking the complicit silence they maintained throughout the intervening decades.
But when Signe's moment of transformation arrives, the emergence of the nurturing mother beneath that gruff exterior we predicted all along seems entirely arbitrary, as is her epiphany about Eero's sudden lovability.
But when the administrative woman suggests that Eero would be sent to a children's home, Signe has a change of heart, but the audience will be hard-pressed to allocate that change of heart's origin.
The film would be riveting if we, along with Eero, had a harder time deciding between both mothers when it's time for his return to Finland.
year old housekeeper Alys (Kate O'Mara, who was actually 31 when she made this).
The problems mount for Victor as his friend Wilhelm gets cold feet over the experiments, an old friend Lt. Becker (Jon Finch) starts to poke around as he investigates various murders around the Castle, Alys tries to blackmail him and he has the added hassle of having Elizabeth move into the Castle when her house is repossessed as he sets about trying to control the monster to do his bidding.
Also whilst in Vienna, he befriends another student, Wilhelm Kassner (Graham James), and persuades him to return to the family castle when the teaching term is over.
Frankenstein inherited the castle, along with a buxom housekeeper named Alys (Kate O'Mara), when his father was killed in a shooting "accident".
Slowly but surely, he assembles all the parts he needs to construct a man, but when the crude, disfigured human monster (David Prowse) is eventually reanimated it has uncontrollably violent tendencies, and smashes its way out the castle to go on a killing spree in the adjacent countryside.
Thankfully, the series bowed out in style three years later when Peter Cushing re-teamed with director Terence Fisher for the dignified swan song FRANKENSTEIN AND THE MONSTER FROM HELL (1973).
There is a climactic moment, at which Howard finally guesses the secret of the voyage, when we can almost sense a first-act curtain descending, because of the way that Howard delivers his lines and the fact that the camera lingers on him several seconds as he stands frozen, a demented, untinentionally hilarious, pop-eyed expression on his face.
Other actors are also hammy, though they don't all reach the level that Howard does when he goes momentarily berserk.
It starts off well enough and plays through the first 30 or 40 minutes as a black comedy... Then things get darker and not so funny anymore and that is when the movie begins to fall apart.
The ending, especially, leaves something to be desired.. You never really feel the ending coming and when it happens, it's not only a surprise, but a disappointing surprise.
They miss people cheating in the contest, they miss Benny deciding to drop out, they even miss the most vital moment of the contest, when the first runner-up takes their hand off the truck.
I was under the impression that being the victim of rape was just about the worst thing that can happen to a woman , a horrific violent ordeal that I can barely imagine , but when the lead character Billie is raped by an unseen attacker it seems all that rape involves is a woman getting her face rubbed gently on the ground .
Worse than that when Billie finds out she`s pregnant by the rape she hardly bats an eyelid .
he walked like he had a gimp leg and he was INCREDIBLY nonthreatening, especially when he started STABBING people with a scythe.
Grim Reaper is a ghost type creature and when she her her boy friend hide behind crates right in front of the Grim Reaper, the Stupid ghost did not see them.
The whole point of a film in my opinion is to entertain, if a film entertains me for it's duration & I have fun then I can forgive almost anything but when it comes to a film such as Grim Reaper which is such a chore to watch I find myself rapidly losing the will to live.
The ending is awful too, since when does dying for a few minutes enable you to travel back in time & change past events?
I had a feeling when i rented this movie i may not like it because of all the horrible straight to DVD movies these days.It reminded me a lot of the movie "room 6" that came out a year earlier.Literally the exact same plot in almost the exact same screwed up hospital which no longer existed.Hallucinations and weird nurses running rampant as some chic is trying to escape encountering other weird patients who are trapped.Finally some soul ripping creature dressed in a black cloak is killing off each patient in her dreams.This movie makes no sense.There is no way to tell what is really happening and it has no continuity.She wakes up from a nightmare to find out she's still in it.
I read the novel, or rather, I was forced into reading it, and I am only being honest when I say that the novel was not one of my favorites.
That Miss Pross girl, when arguing with Madame Defarge, was talking and baring her teeth as if she was going to bite Madame Defarge like an animal.
But, I'd have to say the worst part was when Carton and the seamstress started making out randomly while they were at the Guillitine.
warris charters does not exist and most confusingly of all lucky and dario do not hate each other later in life when they should.
& a stupid hand to hand fight (why bother when you've got a handgun?).
The guy playing the clueless highway patrol officer is a dire actor, not once does he return fire when shot at.
Bad script, bad acting (never saw anyone that's stupid enough to let some guys (zombies, if you could call it zombies) put a bomb in his laps, and just stare at it, as it is just a toy or a girl who looks very ready to scream her guts out when something approach her), bad make-up (the zombies look like a man who got a gray paint all over himself), bad music (using some kind of rock music, didn't really up the heat of this movie), and even bad plot (never seen a zombie who wants revenge only.)
when they shoot the guns no flash or bang goes off, the actors just twitch backwards to show some kickback.
I also loved it when, in the "police station" (cue outside shot of a police station, before cutting to someone's spare room), the FBI agent asks if there was a phone she could use.
The fact that the townsfolk are eventually revealed as 'slaves' of the giant ant community Â after having dissed their existence when reported by the vacationers who fell foul of them on a proposed island resort Â links the film with INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956) which, incidentally, was about to be remade (the second of four versions, so far!)
Her plans fall apart when the group discovers the area is populated by dangerous ants who have apparently come into contact with the nuclear waste mentioned earlier.
I had not seen it since, until a few months ago when I caught it on cable.
No wonder Joan Collins has refused to even discuss this dreadful picture when asked about it.
This was made during the 70's, when disaster films and giant animal horror flicks reigned supreme.
Producer-director Bert I. Gordon, the genius behind such stuff-grows-really-big films as The Amazing Colossal Man and Village of the Giants, brings us a cautionary tale of what can happen when pollution, real-estate scams, and social insects mix.
I recall when the opening credits had the symbol and words "American International" he would laugh and say, "Oh, this must mean this will be a really bad movie."
From the ants that look just as bored as the audience, to the ants that change shape/species from when you see the real to the models.
And when I was a kid, bad acting, bad special effects, badly made "giant ants" wouldn't stop me from watching.
You wouldn't think so, when you hear the ants scream, or them "walking on air" in some hilarious scenes.
I FORCED myself to watch this movie to not only see how much I could stand since I was bored anyway, but to see it entirely so I can be totally correct when I say it is the worst movie to ever see.
The part that really, really irked me was when this older couple, knowing darn well that there where killer ants everywhere eating everything in sight, decided while running away from the ants (while the other characters were trying to find a boat and go down the river to escape the ants) they were going to take a different route and go DEEPER in the woods - how idiotic was that!
The sounds of the ants sounded like children screaming and when they showed a close up of the ants grabbing some of the people, it looked more fake than the guy who wore the rubber suit for "Godzilla"!
I'm sure that when Ms. Collins made it big on the show DYNASTY, she wanted to buy up every copy of these films, but they remain as a testament to just how low her career had sunk in the 1970s.
This film totally ignores the original book.There are also many, MANY changes in this one from the original, like this one:The main character is changed to female Katy McLaughlin, when in the original it was male Ken McLaughling.Horses even died on the set of this film.And I'm sick of EVERYBODY saying ''No horses died, its just a rumor.''
This isn't the story of a young boy daydreaming about owning his own horse, and when his dad allows it he chooses one thought to be too crazy to tame, a boy who learns about love and responsibility.
Her father sells it when she gets hurt, then she turns around and steals it from the rodeo.
My super-favorite part, though, was at the end, when the DAD apologizes to Katy.
The young girl here goes against the horse's natural nature and defies all safety/acts bratty towards her Father when he tries to correct her.
I also think that hunky Tim McGraw was superb, and was jealous of Maria Bello when they did the slow dance!
The thing is he is participating in a good length of these reasonably long fights, especially when you compare that Seagal regularly gets doubled and sometimes isn't even there for his master shots.
Daniel Bernhardt, still in his action man prime, is also wasted and of course when he fights Chuck, the simple fact that they are filmed to hide Chucks double and Chucks lack of speed, Bernhardt can't do much.
I wasn't impressed by the performances either, especially Chuck Norris who reminds us that he just can't act and when he tries, it's more laughable than anything else.
And when they do, they are definitively more convincing than our friend Chuck.
the movie the perfect weapon was probably made for just about the same amount of money when that came out and that looked 100 times better than this movie.
A few years later, he is working with his friends Sam Dalton (Bruce McGill) and Rodney Bedecker (Wil Wheaton, from Star Trek), when he detects an abnormal movement of the tectonic plates, provoked by Alan's new enterprise.
As for casting, I think the only criteria was who was unemployed when it came time to shoot.
The start of the dragon race all starts off when young Quinn stumbles upon a dragon cave and awakes a dragon.
Now, 20 years later when the Earth is dominated by a race of dragons, Quinn (Bale) has become the leader of survivors from England.
The 1980's were the decade when many film studios decided to use their new freedom from petty censorship to convince everyone that eye candy in the form of a little nudity was an essential pre-requisite for any modern romantic comedy.
Its creators would probably be very happy with this consensus, they were not attempting to create a future classic - only to create a comedy which would succeed when it was released and would give them a great deal of fun whilst making it.
Future Doctor Who William Hartnell is the army sergeant on the verge of retirement who makes a wager that his platoon will come out on top when their training is complete.
If you consider it illogical to mention him and "Grindhouse" while reviewing this movie...well, I consider this movie as much a piece of crap as any of the 9/11 hijackers, and I think that I speak for at least most of my generation when I say that we far prefer gross-out exploitation movies to anything starring Doris Day.
Almodovar doesn't even need to be branded an author, he proves it every time, even when his movies are not on a par with his best works.
Moretti could have been brave and have shot a movie about Berlusconi when he was elected head of the Italian government years before.
Or even ten years ago when he was already Il Cavaliere riding through Italy the way he liked.
And why, when in species danger, do humans have to dress up as medieval persons?
The plot breaks down when we realize none of this could actually ever happen.
Commentator 'vranger' of the United States is obviously full of him/herself when it comes to intelligence and the ability to understand plots, thrillers, intrigue, mysteries and scripts, whilst justifying abracadabra, mumbo jumbo and plain junk.
As I alluded to, the action ranges from non-existent to being harshly neutered and you know when one of the 'tense' scenes comprises of jack diving out of the way of a random fire truck, this ship ain't coming in.
Maybe the best of his generation, but when was it?
And when he tries to run or jump stairs, what we see is just an old man limping badly.
I understand the concept of adding red-herrings but when everyone from Jack's students to the campus security guard seem to be hiding something, it just gets absurd.
And please--when was the last time an all-covers band was mooted for a European tour?
I was pretty sure, when I saw that Liam, Julia and Justine Bateman in a movie together, it was going to be somewhat decent.
The best part of this awful film is when the ending credits are rolling and you hear the band playing and singing the title song.
4 teenage girls and a young guy embark on a summer of fun when they land a job playing as a band at a beach resort.
It would have been interesting to have seen this in the theater to see how much the audience groaned when the song started for the third or fourth time.
The "villain," Lucinda, is an ugly troll-like hag who can only spout gibberish when she's not busy hacking useless side characters into giblets.
Sometimes I feel like I ramble on and on when I'm writing one of these.
Even when Grandma shows up and hacks up a few people, it's met with the same ho-hum enthusiasm as the rest of the movie.
Movies that try and portray "facts" as true, when they aren't, aren't enjoyable.
For instance, when we watch "It's a Wonderful Life" we have no trouble in discerning that it is a fantasy.
I saw this movie back when it was first aired in theaters, and it is the only theater movie I've seen that was roundly booed by the audience well before the ending.
I enjoyed James Deans three films and other performances, but I make it a point to not get personally involved when actors die.
If you like dragons, darker themes and that isolation feel (like in Waterworld) and you like to think to yourself "that is the most fuel efficient helicopter" (you'll know what I mean when you see it) go then, see it.
A 9 and 6 year old had me turn it off when I got sick of it, and very lightly suggested we watch Toy Story or Monsters Inc. instead!
I like ENTERTAINING fluff, but PC take no chances we don't want to offend anyone and use jokes and clichÃ©s that were old when Atok made his first comic cave drawing is a colossal waste.
This worked out pretty good a few years ago when Pixar released "toy story" and "a bugs life" because then it was original and groundbreaking, the new visual style made you forget flaws in the story.
I was both when I actually paid money to see this trash.
This credo is put to the ultimate test when Rodney leaves home to Robot City in hopes to get employed in Big Weld's big corporation as an inventor.
Like when Piak throws Tiuri his sword.
Piak doesn't throw it further than a few feet yet when the camera changes its angle, all of a sudden the sword flies another 8 feet.
And when Tiuri meets the lord of the toll I got an emotional response from this performance, even though it doesn't really make sense in light of the book.
So when I saw the trailer and read about it, I hasted myself towards the cinema, assuming this would be a great two hours movie.
Nevertheless - when the endless dragging thru the woods is finished - some beautiful castle pictures.
The jist is that a long-time, unstable employee of Funland is eventually given the heave-ho when the park's ownership changes.
There is big hair though and to further confirm the fact this flick was made in the 80's, has a soundtrack that was almost surely made entirely on one of those big ass sampler keyboards you used to play around with that were on display when you first walked into Sears circa 1984.
Not a lot really happens until the final act when Leslie faces off with the killer.
Also, there is a scene with Jana when she is changing clothes that shows a different actress in her spot with bigger boobs doing the nude scene!
Nothing happens... and when it does it's so slow and totally without enthusiasm, from the makers side.
I did not seem to miss anything during a coffee break during which I did not pause the movie nor did anything important occur when I fast forwarded for a few minutes.
Entourage watchers: Do you remember when the Variety columnist told Johnny Drama that he took a star off his "Five Towns" rating as soon as he saw Drama in the show?
A truly terrifying example of what happens when the studio are determined to make a cookie cutter that they think will make a few quid.
It is enough to say that this film is pure trash and to watch it would be depriving yourselves of 2 hours when you could be putting out rubbish, poking your eye out with a needle or fantasising over Martina NAvratilova.
So I was very happy when I saw a preview a long while back that there was going to be a movie about the book.
I wish that when people decided to make a movie out of a book they would make the movie just like the book.
And, when the perpetrator comes to look for the body, he's caught by Tim.
The most entertaining part of "Bulldog Courage" occurs when Paul Fix (as Bailey) arrives to blow-up a mine; he really uses his "noodle."
It was like when I saw "Evita", "The most talked about movie of the year!"
I smiled when a crash helmeted soldier answers the phone.
The Italian woman leading looks great (like an early Elizabeth Shue) and the funky sixties party when the Slime comes to light is just great.
We will also use jump cuts when focusing on foreign objects that float in space, such as perfectly round and spherical asteroids.
This way, we will not have to watch the object move from being out of focus to in focus, we can sit back and rely on the computer technology to show us the picture right when it is centered and clear.
Space suits will be a shiny silver color and will come equipped with matching gloves and motorcycle helmet visors for when that sun is just a little too bright.
**May Contain Spoilers**  I feel sorry for kids 34 years ago who were enticed by green-tinted newspaper ads and entranced by a cool Famous Monsters cover; they must have been truly disillusioned when they actually saw the movie.
Horton and Richard Jaeckel in one of his many thankless roles argue over who's fit to lead the expedition, when they're not fighting over Luciana Paluzzi.
They shoot at the slime creatures anyway with ray guns and when their guns run out of ray, throw them at the monsters.
Critics here in the UK panned it when it came out, saying that it needed more special effects, but they completely missed out on the charm of the film, which was in the ingenious ways that it showed the human race had been changed by the onset of the dragons.
Boy when you watch it you can see why.
  Oh, man....I finished watching this movie a couple of hours ago and I'm still laughing hysterically when I think about it.
This is Japanese SciFi cult ( even though they used American actors, they STILL dubbed it...badly ) coming to you straight out of the era when cinema actually had evoluated a lot.
It got here as an uninvited visitor when some heroes destroyed an asteroide.
The action begins when Chloe and Jimmy Olsen decide to have a romantic evening in at the Daily Planet offices, when suddenly a gunshot goes off and they find Lana Lang in the lift unconscious, clearly the victim of a shooting.
The movie takes a turn for the worse when the opening sequence presents itself.
In all honesty I loved the first film, Romancing the Stone, so I when I heard there was a sequel to this I was excited to see it.
I'm a big fan of Christie, not just Poirot and Miss Marple, but also her other characters, most of these novels have been made into decent programmes (although when her short stories are adapted for television there is obviously some padding put in,) but in most cases they tend to stick quite close to the source.
To the point whereby when my brother recorded this for me at it's first showing, he entitled the cassette "The Murder of The Murder of Roger Ackroyd".
The cinematography is quite good, but that's what you'd expect when you're filling the screen with dragons.
I wonder what title they'll come up with when they release the film on DVD today.
I felt like this was a Dodgeball rip-off; there was the handicapped trainer, fat and lazy rags to riches character(s), fighting for something barely obtainable, and the gung-ho girl ready to do it all (play dodgeball or pingpong), and some sort of try out where the team/person lost when it appeared to be a sure win.
The story begins in London in 2008, when a tunnel crew unearths a massive underground chamber containing a dragon who, like most of us, is a little cranky first thing in the morning.
The dragon, oddly, sleeps through the breaching of its den with a massive roaring drilling machine, and only wakes up when it is nudged.
Like most monster movies, "Reign of Fire" suffers badly when the monsters are offscreen catching a smoke break, and we are left with flat characters speaking silly dialogue in a tepid story.
Wong makes Randy appear foolish when Wong's slim, sexy, athletic niece Maggie (the woefully underused Maggie Q of "Live Free or Die Hard") whips him repeatedly at ping-pong.
please listen to me and give it a miss , in fact when its on terrestrial TV (in about 4 weeks i'd say) just go out for a picnic or something ... anything to get away from it !!
I picked this film from the local video store when noticing that Christopher Walken was in it.
The so called "jokes" were desperately trying to be funny and I found myself shaking my head and wondering what was going through Walken's mind when he agreed to be in this one.
I wanted to unwind a little after a long day at the University Library and so when I went to the local Cinema, guess what?
Unfortunately, those strategically cut previews were the ONLY good parts of the movie which weren't even nearly as good when shown in the uncut full length movie.
The only positive this film had was that Maggie, the daughter of the over-exaggerated ping pong master Wong, was fairly cute.... but why waste 10.50 to see her for a few shots when there's google images?
I kept thinking to myself "No, when Christopher Walken shows up, this movie will get better."
Don't waste your money - even when this pile of poo comes out on DVD.
But when they write movies, the results are well nigh unwatchable.
), and Robert Ben Garant often fails to sell the jokes, even when they are potentially amusing.
Even when the comic performances are good, as is the case with Walken and co-writer Thomas Lennon himself, the editing is so poor that the gags almost never hit.
Balls of Fury wasn't the total disaster, but when that's the highest praise I can offer, well, that's a problem.
I was only two when the original miniseries came out, but ever since I was in about grade 5 or 6, and first saw it, I've absolutely loved it and even created a webpage dedicated to The Thorn Birds.
Although I did like the part when Ralph fought with Luke.
For instance in the original the first time Ralph sees Dane is when he is a teenager.
Dane also had a strong Aussie accent compared to the original when it was a US accent.
The baby wrecks his room, breaking and throwing things all over the place, and he starts to have a violent fit of some sort when Lucy and Gino try to christen him in a church.
At home the baby cries weirdly and when he is checked they notice that his room is tore up.
Now when she looks at her child sometimes she sees the face of him and she keeps telling Dr. Finch that something is wrong.
Your probably bemused in what I've written so far, but that's how you're going to feel when watching this quite silly, out-of-control baby horror flick.
But more often you'll be waiting for something different to happen and the constant flashes of the dwarf's face on the baby when it's chucking a hissy fit and knocking off the unexpected victims it's just far from menacing.
Why didn't she do that when she first arrived?
(Bates seemed to specialise in horror films- he also acted in "Dr Jekyll and Sister Hyde", and this is referred to when in a hospital scene we hear an announcement for a "Dr Jekyll".
The genre declined in importance in the second half of the decade, largely because the broadcasting authorities were becoming more permissive about violence provided it was shown late at night, and in the eighties the industry, freed of its addiction to horror exploitation movies and silly sex comedies, underwent a revival when it returned to making intelligent and watchable films.
Actually she was 42 when this was produced and she's amazingly attractive for her age , unfortunately that's not a good enough reason for making this movie .
i still dont know why i rented this silly movie.. Steve Martian was so weird in this one.. as was Bill Murray... what were these people thinking when they made this movie???
In fact, when the two main characters get down and do it, the scene cuts just as they start, a baffling methodology of the director and editor for a supposed sex spoof.
The ridiculousness of the whole thing shoots through the roof when Charles Bukowski wanders drunkenly through a party scene wearing a shirt that says "Water boy for the wet T-shirt contest" (maybe they lured extras by advertising free beer).
As they travel, he learns more about his aunt's life as she tells her story in flashback, including when she first met Mr. Visconti.
Given the timing of this announcement - when Henry is wavering about pulling a scam - one wonders.
If we go on the premise that she's exaggerating and lying when it suits her, I think Smith's take on Augusta is excellent.
How did an Alien race capable of interstellar travel manage to get anywhere with shuttle ships that fall out of the sky when struck by lightning?
It's not particularly funny, it doesn't work as a 'documentary' because you learn nothing slightly interesting or fascinating about the characters nor do you gain any insight when you see them or him in action, and the acting is so unnatural that it comes across in some parts as a bad improvisation game, it doesn't work as a gangster film because the majority of the film is spent on dull conversation.
"Hey, let's see what happens when we use a flame-thrower on a stereo!
I just finished watching "High School Confidential" on TCM, and it's even worse than I remembered it was when I first watched it 50 years ago at a Drive-In theater.
The dialogue is outrageous - especially the scene in the classroom when one of the male students talks about Christopher Columbus going to that "deep pool" of the Alantic Ocean with his "non-stop studs" - which now, out of context, sounds more like a line from a gay porno flick instead of a 1950s b-movie (!).
And by the time the ending has rolled around, all vestiges of the source material have vanished completely, an unforgivable crime in my opinion when working with an author as great as Greene.
But no, when you look at this movie you'll realize that it also is far from a perfect one.
Buck is in perpetual pre-pubescence, and while Chuck had moved away when they were kids and developed into a normally functioning person, Buck stayed behind in the town and developed a psychotic, homo erotic fixation for his old friend Chuck.
All Buck seems to want to do is to revert back to the times he remembers when they were kids.
Chuck may be able to fend off the guy at first by simply going back home to L.A., but when Buck moves there and injects himself into Chuck's daily routine, he becomes harder to avoid.
Worse, while Chuck tries to avoid his exceptionally creepy friend, it becomes exceedingly difficult when Buck fails to grasp any sort of reality that things are different and forever will be.
But it becomes more or less offensive when you consider the messages it essentially offers on homosexuality and to a lesser extent, women.
Too much happens, especially when combined with the hormone cocktail that is puberty.
Did Buck just sit in the house until he was 22 when his mom got sick?
Considering the kiss, one would think he really wanted to, since even when a lot of guys 'experiment' with other dudes, kissing is rarely on the menu.
At least I can relate to wanting an intimate connection just once when having a powerful crush on someone, but don't think that getting it physically would suddenly make it all better... probably the opposite.
Maggie Smith's performance (and I am a fan of Maggie's) was just too loud, too dramatic, just way too over the top, so that when her sad side emerged, it came across as equally phony.
Her makeup as a very much older woman is flawless and when she played her younger self, it was a much more controlled performance.
I wasn't very excited to watch this movie when I first saw the commercials.
Then when I actually watched it, it was worse.
I don't like when the songs in the movie are set up to be like a music video.
Also, in the book, when the reader learns about Pavel being hurt and his imminent death, the grandmother encourages Jimmy to go, as well as making sandwiches.
Towards the end of the film when Jim returns to visit Antonia and her husband and children, the narrator states that it has been fifteen years since he last saw her.
In the book, the time between when Jim last saw Antonia and when he goes back is set at twenty years.
Alec McCowen is fine as Henry Pulling, the bank clerk who fusses with dahlias in his spare time and fumes prissily when cannabis is mixed with the ashes of his mother.
On the Roger Corman timeline, this is right after he got done using 'big' budgets (for BATTLE BEYOND...) and right before he started cannibalizing his own stuff for footage (BATTLE BEYOND... okay, so 'during' the period when he was ripping himself off, but I was thinking of RAPTOR), and the end result is something neither good nor interesting.
Similarities include (but are not limited to: a homemade flamethrower, a chest-bursting monster, lots of drool, a pair of engineers- one black, one white, an aging male captain who is somewhat heroic, a tense scene in something resembling air ducts, Creature reproduction includes humans, and a pet that is orphaned when its owner is killed.
The most obvious ripoff is the scene when they are searching a storage room (cargo bay) for the creature.
Bright spot is Starr Andreeff as Stevens' beautiful love-interest who may possibly become a victim of the rampaging gargoyle..in the plot, the gargoyles rape and impregnate other human females so that their race may breed and grow;Sue, when attempting to assist her hurt lover, is captured and victimized by the rubber fiend.
3)The hero (Andrew Stevens) is obviously more upset when his dog gets injured than when his black colleague and even his girlfriend get torn to pieces.
The story had little meaning other than not to let love go when you have it.
And when it's all finally over... all you seem to have done is wasted 2 hours of your life... ...and then the bad cover of "Every Breath You Takes" starts up.
If you're looking for Scott Bakula eye candy, then this is not the best you can do - he has a terribly fake moustache and the only scenes he is remotely attractive in, is when he has a singlet on and you can only see his back.
A couple of scenes are halfway cute and some are tear jerker's, though the part of the movie I liked the best was when it ended.
Further on, when she gets sick, she claims that she all the time are forced to lie to the children, for their own good.
When hero burglarizes a dentists office you'll be on the edge of your seat and later when he gets beat up by a flying sheet of plywood?
It all begins when a storm knocks down some power lines, drawing all the earthworms in the area to the surface of the ground.
Yup, it's hard to be "artsy" with a film about a horrible outbreak of billions of killer worms--and even tougher when your total budget is $39.95 and your actors have never even had the experience of doing TV commercials or community theater!
The movie has the usual unexpected shock scenes when the story line drags and the special effects don't really work well at all.
Well, when I watched the uncut version, actually I have to in some ways admit that this wasn't the worst film ever made, worthy of MST3K sarcasm, but I would say that the problems are minor and the film just needs a band-aid, lol.
Absolutely terrible, I read this novel when I was very young and although I didn't fully understand it, I was as haunted by Rebecca as everyone else in the novel was.
There is no chemistry between the leads, despite the script showing them kissing passionately at a time in the book when he barely touches her.
There's no romance between them, in fact their kisses seem awkward and forced, and a bit disgusting, given how much older than her he looks (not to mention his lack of sex appeal and passion) The script itself is terrible, deviating from the book, having her challenging him at a time when in the book, she can barely speak to him.
While director Condon may have started in horror (this is the only one I've watched, actually), he really came into his own when he branched out into other genres Â and, quite frankly, I wouldn't have bothered watching this hadn't he been involved...
For the most part this film is pretty lousy as the acting is some of the worst I've seen in a flick with a budget as large as this films' is, the scares are also somewhat predictable as well as unoriginal---however though, when I think about it now how psychotically creative (for lack of a couple of better words) could one really be with a hook anyway?
The rest of the film revolves on Annie Tarrant, who becomes dangerously close with the hook-handed bogeyman when she starts investigating her family history.
Unfortunately, when the original is a load of blah, you're always going to be on to a loser.
As a white male, when I said this, most people gave me a look as if I just said, "I'm thinking about investing money in 'Phat Beach II'!"
Check out Kate's entrance when she is first created!
It is best viewed when drinking or sick so that the pain can be numbed a little.
I wanted to cry when I read the summary, as it had absolutely nothing to do with the book.
Well, my objectives were a little less grandiose, but when I got a chance to see this on TCM, I was excited that I would be able to view this, and mark one movie off the IL'IMDb list.
Ulysses S. Grant shows up.I don't mind talky sf pictures when the talk means something (The Day the Earth Stood Still is great), but this is just drivel.
An example "Oh, Whatsyourname, all I know is that when the rocket does explode, please hold me.
My guess is that the film was finished and in the can when RKO went under and was sold to Warner Brothers to distribute.
However, when you make a movie called FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON, it's not unreasonable for audiences to expect to get at least what is promised in the title.
I had vague memories of watching this film on television with my parents when I was about ten years old.
I reacquainted myself with this film when TCM broadcast it recently.
Everything is changed, from the type of aircraft, from what happens to it, from the characters that end up in it, from why people decided to get into such a canon ball in the first place when, in the original story, nobody was supposed to fly in it.
I do wonder what people think of when they are making garbage like this?
I saw it for the first time when I was 11 and I must say I liked it.
But then I saw it again as an adult and the awful truth came out: 1) it is impossible for Steve Reeves to even try to act; 2) it is impossible for the supporting cast to act; 3) the sort of monster the argonauts face when they find the golden fleece is definitely funny (though he probably puts on the best acting of all); 4) Reeves's hairdo is unthinkable in ancient Greece; 5) any other ingredient you may think of.
There's your typical dark side in this epic schlock, but time starts to drag at scenes when you'd rather see the Herc bending iron bars across his skull.
Where was PETA when this happened?
I watched this movie because of the fond memory I had kept of it when I watched it when I was 12 and that peplum movies were my favorite genre.
Some of the characters make no sense at all (such as the princess who loves Hercules but fights with him when Herc sets out to do EXACTLY what she'd asked him to do) and some are so one-dimensional they looked like they were written by a 3rd grader.
It's amazing, though, how much more interesting I found Sylva Koscina this time around than I did when I was a kid.
I would have liked to have seen more tits and the odd clunge shot thrown in, if only in the bonus features as this would have given the film a higher mark when it comes to production values.
The tantrum she throws at the Trailer Show completely reminded me of a child (maybe me when I was younger?)
Even when he puts his foot down, like a mischievous child she circumvents and tricks him, which inevitably turns out badly because the thing he was standing for indeed held disastrous consequences.
What do you get when you cross a low-budget zombie movie with a story about a team of masked wrestlers?
I think instead what happened is the would-be director found some change when he was vacuuming under his couch cushions and thought, "What the hell, I'm calling my pals and we're gonna make a movie."
I'm guessing they cast him as a zombie on the misunderstanding he was acting, and when they swapped him to Ulysses and realised it wasn't an act... it was too late, the budget was blown.
Ulysses was so flat I could use his character as a coaster, and thats really a problem when he's supposed to be the hero.
I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this film.
Akitas are LOVELY dogs, and animal abuse is sick and gross; Pseudo Bon Jovi was a recovering addict, yet everyone was overjoyed when he and perpetually jonsing Mimi become a couple--and given it was a previous girlfriend that had gotten him hooked in the first place--Maybe NOT such a good coupling; I noticed as they all patted themselves on the back at the bar (I frequented the real one, it looks nothing like that inside)for their avant garde status, they were completely loathsome to the wait staff...dudes, chances are the servers are boho, too---THEY just take responsibility for their lives.
Director Chris Columbus makes little effort to experiment in staging or editing the musical numbers; when he isn't obviously copying A CHORUS LINE or HAIR, Columbus gives us an endless array of static shots of characters standing and singing; so much so that the rare inventive moment, such as Rapp and Tracie Thoms nicely doing "The Maureen Tango," seem strangely out of place.
I remember when RENT opened on Broadway.
The most honest moment in the film comes when the Mark films a homeless women who was being harassed by the cops.
The actors take a moment to reflect before the songs take off, and none of the songs are worth humming when you leave the theater.
They are quite poor, and when the girl (Henri) meets a rich boy at school, she wants to be part of his family.
I'll be waiting for when it goes on sale.
Douglas Fairbanks jr had already been in the movie business for 14 years when he made this film, despite being a youthful 21 years old.
I even have read of a cult following with this series....   Now this movie even given when it was made was so bad that I couldn't stop watching... the acting is horrible even for an independent film that I think was to be the horror part of this movie...
But only when you haven't seen ever any other movie before.
I was deeply saddened when this show was canceled, as it seemed there should have been one or two more years left to finish the story of Deadwood and these remarkable characters.
So, when all is said and done, what can we make of this movie?
Next major issue, if the "goblins" were vegetarians, then why turn people into vegetables when they can grow their own!
specifically i mean the one that the sister turns into when they are in the car.
I didn't get into how Elliot was getting naked with his friends and watching porno stuff with monkeys and bad music, but since your friends are not even worried about how corn and vegetables will kill you, then it makes sense that you button up your shirt when your girlfriend shows up unexpected.
One of the strangest scenes in the movie (there are a lot of them) is when the kid receives a vision from grandpa that he must pee on the green icing covered dinner his family is about to eat to keep them from becoming trolls.
Another wonderfully horrible scene is when two guys venture into the weird troll witch's lair and one of them is turned into a plant, which doesn't really seem to bother him too much.
Which by the way when eaten turns you into a goblin.
I have not seen this movie recently, but I remember wanting to see it when I was very young, right when it had just came out.
Maybe somebody was very drunk when they decided to make this film.
Or when they made it.
Or when they went ahead with all the stages of production.
The plot focuses on vampires; in particular, the legendary Count Dracula and the action kicks off (eventually) when a businessman receives a mysterious package from London containing a case of brandy.
The ONLY valid reason for this piece of (expletive deleted) to exist is to show to film students and budding actors how to try to act when the material is SO bad....Viggo and McHattie, i always knew were undervalued actors but they are positively heroic in my mind, for continuing to move and speak what was given to them by Beth B.......  And Dominique Davolos was actually the emotional center of the film in that Beth B gave her marvelous NATURAL speech to speak, while reacting to the bullshit that Viggo and McHattie had to utter....she was the ONLY normal relation to the average experience of the film-goer...  i personally despise Christianity, but this garbage of film-making is an unfair insult to Christianity as religion...  AND THE MUSIC WAS HORRIBLE!!
I think the point when it really goes over the edge was when Fabian's eye patch actually switched from his one eye to his other eye and back again.
He is running on a dock when this happens.
It's hard to believe that Karen Black appeared in this terrible, extremely low=budget travesty, when she was already established as a star.
"Time Walker" starts out iffy, gets worse, then when it just starts to get interesting...IT'S OVER!
Apparently, he hates it when he loses his marbles.
I love towards the end when the campus president's evil assistant enunciates every syllable of his lines.
I saw this film when it came out in the theater 23 years ago and I'm still mad about the $4.50 I paid and the precious 83 minutes of my life that I will never get back.
The rest of the cast comes off as somewhere between "unlikeable" and "despicable", (I have no idea what they are like in real life, so please don't take this as character assassination), so you actually sort of enjoy it (instead of being horrified) when the mummy kills them.
I can boldly state that because I had actually seen it in the movie theaters when it came out, and on MST.
That urge awakened recently when I found this obscure gem on an old ex-rental tape, so this was my chance to re-watch it.
The movie builds up towards a nice twist-conclusion too, but sadly when you know the tagline to this movie, or just take a glimpse at the front or back cover art, you already know what's going to happen.
There's a few cool scenes such as when the mummy attacks a woman and pushes her against a wall, and throws a man in the air.
In the end, the mummy retrieves its tacky jewelry and is about to beam itself up(to what, we'll never know, since I doubt the mother ship actually hung around waiting for it to return for three thousand years)when a security guard tries to shoot it.
Katherine Hepburn) doesn't show up very often, but when she does, she's somehow riveting .
Were then treated to yet another 'lets tie the woman up and torment her' type of scenarios....we also have not so shocking 'could this be incest' moments when the lone man suddenly has a daughter type tagging along to help him in his deeds.
Trust me when I say, a dollar was too much.
For example, they rent a lodge, talk on phone to owner before, and are not greeted by him when they arrive.
However, on the bright side, this film was dumb and unrealistic, but at least when somebody is dead, they stay dead.
Oh and Stu was already out of the band when they recorded "My Bonnie".
The story begins with Terry(Joyce Hauser) is very upset when she does not win a Journalist contest.
If you haven't seen it, buy the DVD when it's released, and I'll guarantee that you'll love every single moment.
Robert Altman, when asked which movies influenced him the most, said: "the movies I hated the most," he'd see a film and think "I'll never make a movie like that."
Bad Trip is aptly named; that's how you feel when it finally ends.
In the novel, Cathy and Heathcliffe are both around 12 when they meet the Lintons.
Everything starts when Valerie (Sheila Kelley), a daughter from a rich industrial, decides to go on holiday herself and as she is the typical dumb blonde who is born for bad luck, she soon get kidnapped.
Well the biggest problem is that the goal of this film is Martin Short doing slapstickgags and after 5 minutes you know when you see a staircase he will fell or when a door is closed he will bump into it.
And it goes on and on, till the moment it really is embarrassing (see the moment when he is stick by a bee and his body swells...).
The froth of Harper's success fizzles when he learns that his ex-college flame, BET-TV producer Jordan Armstrong (Nia Long of "Friday") has circulated an advance copy of his semi-autobiographical effort among his close chums.
Things come to a boil when Lance suspects the worst.
That was the year when "Le Professionnel" and "La ChÃ©vre" was released.
I sometimes really hate way American film-making works: when they got so tired of their own clichÃ©s, they do a remake of a foreign film, which has foreign clichÃ©s.
Many words come to mind when describing this film but, unfortunately, `funny' isn't one of them.
I can't in good heart call it a bad film but at the same time I can't really say I enjoyed it when I didn't.
However, in an effort to sneak in smut, small studios created films to shock adults when they learn about terrible social ills, though they were REALLY intended to titillate and slip adult themes past the censors!
First, when the stupid lady falls in the lake (thus allowing the audience a cheap thrill when she flashes her boobs), the bad cousin pushes the stupid girl's clothes into the fire (where the had been drying).
However, when a nice reporter gets involved, he is able to rush in and save the day at the end--convincing everyone that the lady is only a dim-wit, not a slut or drug user!!
Such as when the doctor is called because the Dumb Girl's sister is "in a bad way" after using pot.
Yes, it's a romantic comedy-drama full of moments that we've seen done before and while unoriginality is not a cinematic sin (or, good grief, we would rarely see any film released in cinemas) it isn't a good thing when everything has been done BETTER than the movie you're currently watching.
The dubbing is just awful, even when the characters appear to be mouthing in English.
"Make the characters pay no attention at all the huge lumps of rock are floating around, crashing into each other, generally raining destruction all over, and which could kill them all at any moment -- but make them stop and gasp in fear when they see a harmless-looking, almost pastoral green rock in the distance."
Its actually a true account of events that had occurred between the friends when enrolled in college.
A fluke of film that happened to hit at a time right when that whole indie Clerks/Pulp Fiction thing was big.
Heck, you know it's lame when instead of blowing away bad-guy Weathers, she shoots him with pepper spray.
And, when the evil assassins strike, they only chose methods with the lowest probability of success!!!
His mincing homosexual routine is pretty embarrassing--as well as awfully offensive when seen today--at least to some in the audience.
Things get sticky when one of the group has written an about to be published novel, where the characters are just thinly disguised versions of his friends and how revelations in this book alter and shake the foundations of these relationships.
The most amusing part of my whole viewing experience was when a man in his mid 30's, young family in tow, began to walk out of the cinema and then, once he reached the aisle, turned to face the screen and shouted "B*ll@#ks!!!"
I saw this on television when it first aired , and remembered it as being terrible.
It's quite uncanny that transformation occurs for certain characters especially when it's needed.
I don't mind programmes like Till Death Us Do Part in which a character is bigoted but their attitudes are shown as wrong and I also don't like extreme political correctness partly because when there are cases like this and people comment on it others defend the sexism by complaining about "PC madness".
But of course I'm just spouting a load of feminist rubbish because we all know women were treated much better when their were no laws protecting them from sexual harassment, no refuges for battered wives and a woman could be ostracised for leaving her husband even if he hit her which is what happened to my great aunt.
One moment he appears to be frightened by Jacob Marley's ghost, the next he's calmly helping lift Marley's jaw when his jaw-wrap is untied.
Yet when he visits his Christmases Past, Present and most of the future, Stewart is oddly stoic the whole time...even during tragic moments.
There's a moment when the Ghost of Christmas Present tells Scrooge Tiny Tim will die, Stewart just folds his arms and looks down.
Think of a great episode of the Cosby Show re-written for an adult audience, bearing a PG-13 rating and you know how you'll feel when you leave the theater.
Ten years ago, when I first heard that TNT had made a new version of Charles Dickens' timeless Christmas story, I got very excited, and looked forward, with great anticipation, to Patrick Stewart's turn as the miserly, cold-hearted Scrooge.
In those moments when Stewart does attempt to inject some color, his instinct is all wrong.
It seemed frozen in a perpetual glare, even when he was supposedly happy.
The only warmth I got from the entire production was at the very end, when Cratchit's family was on Scrooge's doorstep.
I know that books rarely make to the screen (big or small) without changes, but it always amazes me when the changes are apparently made by a writer to "improve" a story.
However, when she moves to a suburban New Jersey town she realizes that her chances of being famous are pretty much zero.
It was kind of scary at the part when she gets disapointed when she finds out Stu Wolf is a drunk and she can't talk about his music with him, something like that just recently happened to me.
I got so mad at her when she was telling everyone that Lola didn't go to the party and everyone believed her, because I know how Lola must have felt.
The scene at the end when she sings "That Girl" was really cool too.
I really like that song, but the song that got to me the most was the very last song when she explained the end of the story with Sam and everything.
When i saw the whole scene with Lola and Ella when her friend told her how she had changed her life, i couldn't help thinking, "I wish I could do something like that for someone."
I have to say Lindsey Lohan was dressed wonderfully for the most part, but when we got 2 the part where everyone laughs at her I couldn't help but feel satisfied after having to watch this rubbish!!
9 also why was everyone so shocked when she sang for the first time?
And what was with her friend following her around all the time crying and saying " oh i can't lie to my parents", but then doing it anyway and being so happy when she got grounded?
I expected more of this movie when watching it.
But clearly when watching this movie, you realize, she's just a spoiled teenager, who wants what she wants, and will do anything to have it that way.
This movie leans toward Lola becoming a actress, but then completely turns off that subject, when Lola discovers her favorite band is going to be in New York, and absolutely has to be back for the ultimate concert, dragging her best friend along with her.
There have been lots of movies about obnoxious kids, but "Drama Queen" really has raised the bar when it comes to movies about spoiled bratty selfish obnoxious kids.
Parents really resent being dragged to this kind of film, especially when there are films around like Finding Nemo, which are actually entertaining for everyone.
So she is crushed when her Mom moves her from New York City to a suburb.
After executing his last legally ordained job as a Montana marshal, Seth Bullock moves to a gold-mining camp known as Deadwood, where he and his partner Sol Star strike a deal with Al Swearengen, on a lot for their hardware storeÂ   While suspicions arise that 'road agents' may have been the true perpetrators of the killing of an entire family on the Spearfish road, competition arrives for Swearengen in the form of the Bella Union, a new joint from Chicago operated by Cy TolliverÂ  DeadwoodÂa town without any laws or courtsÂis the center of a gold rush and is presided over by Al Swearengen, a saloon owner, and a brothel operatorÂ His showing makes two different things between the coward and the lapse of momentary fearÂ Let him doubt those he's trusted, this camp will run red with bloodÂ  The show centers on Seth Bullock, a young man with a powerful temper who got a lot of Hickok's qualitiesÂ But being a man with an active conscience Bullock declines to accept the horrors around himÂ  We are rapidly introduced to most of the other important characters:  Wild Bill HickokÂan asset to any saloon, and any joint he frequentsÂcomes to look for business opportunity and sits there, losing at pokerÂ He is the fastest gun aroundÂ While his respect for Bullock grows, he commissions 'Montana' to do a review of the Garret claim...  CochranÂthe town doctor who takes heat from Al Swearengen every time one of the whores is poorly sickÂwas full of opinion and took the most comprehensive view when he treated the bright widowÂ Now he doesn't feel at such perfect liberty to opine on her husband's case as he did on hersÂ  E.B.
FarnumÂJudas Goat looking fellow, coyote-moving typeÂis Swearengen's water boy, the innkeeper of a thousand faces staring straight at extinctionÂ  Brom GarretÂthe naÃ¯ve city investor who had to go all his $20,000 to turn Farnum away and purchase a gold claimÂpursues his remedies in some other fashionÂ   SophiaÂthe little survivorÂcould settle who killed her people, road agents or SiouxÂ  JewelÂborn with difficulties and hardships that got no cureÂwants the doctor to brace her leg so her dragging it doesn't drive Swearengen crazyÂ  Charlie UtterÂwho considers himself an important hand at the freight businessÂ plays a man too loyal and honest for his own goodÂ  Whitney EllsworthÂwho saw something he shouldn't have, a man pushed off from a ridgeÂseemed very competent and trustworthyÂ  Mr. WuÂthe only source of opium in the campÂfinds a common language with Searengen when an opium theft occursÂ   SmithÂthe Reverend who has a distinct, clear set of moralsÂknows from past experience that it's a solace having friendsÂ   Ian McShane is a joy to watchÂ He gives a first-class performance as Al Swearengen, the oppressive boss who can order the execution of any man in the settlement with just a wordÂ McShane who runs his Gem with the help of his cronies, emits power in every order he givesÂ  While McShane is a marvelous villain who generates a palpable menace, Boothe is maniacally evil as Cy exuding despicable charm Â Well dressed Cy is the gentleman on the outside while more cruel as Swearengen in beating, kicking, and killingÂ  Such a performer was found with Timothy Olyphant, very effective as a formal marshal who understands the danger of his own temperamentÂ Seth Bullock stood before Alma Garret as a married man to his brother's widow after he was killedÂ He took their five-year-old boy as his own sonÂ  The 4 show women that are trapped in a man's world are: Molly Parker as Mrs. Garret, the beautiful addict wife who suspects foul playÂ She inevitably feels she's had some part in what befalls her husband; Kim Dickens as Joanie Stubbs, the very attractive solitary woman who uses to make Cy warm; Paula Malcomson as Trixie, the prostitute who must've done some fancy to keep Al from Killing herÂ She tries to help Alma with the orphaned child while keeping her master in the dark; Robin Weigert as Calamity Jane, the sewer mouth that follows Hickok aroundÂ When she confronts the greasy-haired dangerous man who pulls all the strings, she fell apart, broken and weakÂ  There's something powerful and moving about 'Deadwood'Â It's truly a drama of memorable characters, dark and ultra-violentÂ If you love Westerns, don't miss it!
I don't blame the lesser denizens of the Hong Kong film industry for trying to make a buck when the biggest breakout sensation of that industry (probably ever) suddenly died and the industry lost its biggest marquee draw.
If you don't crack up when someone says something totally pointless or if you just don't like worthless humor then you'd do best in staying away from this movie.
In this movie you'll see situations when they "want" you to laugh.
Why would you want to waste anything on this movie when there are so many other, MUCH better, movies out there?
After seeing a movie like Scrapple, one wonders how this film isn't being distributed on a national level, when so many undeserving movies are.
I shiver when I recall the crass manner of "acting" in this "thing"; please do not make the same mistake I made in watching this.
Judging from the user comments, a lot of people took the film too seriously when really this sequel is a harmless movie.
When they did, be it shells from one of the ugliest-looking tanks I've ever seen or bullets from a handgun at point-blank range, Ice Cube was able to dodge every last one, even when he was in an APC.
From when Ice Cube and that guy on the aircraft carrier exchanged playful banter to when Ice Cube was talking to his girlfriend...
The characters were so two dimensional and used so many clichÃ©'s, I literally had to turn off the movie and return later when I could compose myself.
I mean, everyone knows when you have a horrible movie, the effects should serve as a happy distraction, but in this movie, they just blended in with the rest of this poorly developed plot.
There is a line where xXx says "I was born looking guilty" but this is lost when the rest of the black characters are portrayed as crooks and thugs... in positive light!
I had not seen the first xXx movie when I went to watch this so I basically had no idea what was xxx all about, except for guns and high-speed cars of course.
So in the end i think this "James Bond on steroids" will probably attract a lot of 15-yearolds that like when things keep moving and lights keep flashing.
I had no idea what State of the Union was going to be about when I went to see it last weekend.
Diesel can deliver the action and stunts solidly but he's so annoying when it comes to dialog and comedy moments.
I did notice however that the action in the sequel are more military in nature when compared to that of the first film wherein its action is more related to extreme sports.
Trading in Vin Diesel (his character is written out by someone saying that he got killed in Bora Bora) for Ice Cube is no improvement; not only is he not the most expressive actor, but he's not that convincing in action (when he's being chased by Scott Speedman you just KNOW that Speedman would catch him like that (snaps fingers) in real life).
In fairness to Mr. Cube, he's far from the only thing wrong with this; Simon Kinberg's screenplay seems not only to have been aimed at emotionally and intellectually stunted 13-year-olds but written by them as well, with the plot starting idiotically and continuing from there - the villainous Secretary of Defence played by Willem Dafoe is so pantomime villainous that when he makes a speech to Jackson you're surprised he doesn't laugh maniacally.
Suspending disbelief is one thing, but when you have a movie that expects people to believe that tanks can be handled like motorbikes... and which works in such daft plot turns as characters having their deaths faked just so they can be around for the climax (why not just kill them there?)...
Also this film is under the 2 hour mark a sign of a film that does know when its wearing out its welcome.
But when Rampling asks Dussollier the following question: "Was it one of your b******?
A suitcase full of counterfeiting equipment worth millions comes into his possession when he literally walks into a shootout.
James Marshall stars as an ex-crook trying to go straight however this is hard because his criminal record keeps haunting him and ruins his chance for any decent employment, however when he gets his hands on a counterfeit plate, three sets of mobsters come gunning for him.
I was there when it was playing.
Not only was Jackie better when he was younger, he still IS better and he is more than twice the age of the stars of this movie!
I had been drawn to the film when I had read several articles that mentioned its bad reputation, so when I found a cheap copy I figured I'd give it a try.
There are plenty of explosions and the real bomb is when you start watching this film and wonder when it will ever end.
Whenever there is action in the film, he just disappears from the picture and re-appears when the shooting and fight is over.
It is SOOOOOooo terrible that you can use it as reference point for the rest of your life when judging other films.
And when the Japanese troops spoke Japanese, the subtitle was "Asian Talking".
But when Mandarin Chinese (I assume its Mandarin) is spoken, its also couched as "Asian Talking".
You never really notice his weight until the very end when he is walking away.
If your a seagal fan don't watch it, he was probably depressed when He made it..and now I am.
What is a surprise is when there's a gunfight scene and a dozen characters appear who have no other part in this movie and kill each other.
"Making of Black Dawn" can be summed up as "let's show the main characters filming the helicopter sequence" and Tamara Davies laments that she finds it hard to feel tension when she's sitting in a fake helicopter on the set.
Whenever there is action in the film, he just disappears from the picture and re-appears when the shooting and fight is over.
It is SOOOOOooo terrible that you can use it as reference point for the rest of your life when judging other films.
when Cold tells her to throw the bomb out the window into the action that seems the most ridiculous.
Jump to Los Angeles where the deal is to take place & where CIA agent & Cold's friend Amanda Stuart (Tamara Davies) has Donovan's brother James (John Pyper-Ferguson) under surveillance, however when she is caught by Donovan's men Cold has to blow his cover & rescue her.
Now the Donovan's have plans for a nuclear weapon & the equipment to build it that they intend to sell to a bunch of Russian suicide bombers who intend to become marters when they blow Los Angeles up, that is unless one-man army Cold can stop them...
There's this really dumb twist at the end when some guy we have only seen once is revealed to be behind it or something yet for some reason he is there to start the bomb & kill the Russian terrorists, why not just let the Russians start the bomb & blow themselves up & like just make sure your out of Los Angeles well in advance?
His screen presence is a draw, but not when he ain't on the freaking screen.
Alain Delon is a competent actor when well directed (remember 'A Plein Soleil' or 'The Leopard'), but here he is awful and unbelievable as the sissy Governor, and only slightly better as the heroic Zorro.
I knew it was going to be bad when the presenter of the film described it as a "guilty pleasure."
I was very excited when I was going to rent this movie.
For directors shooting movie such as Elisabeth comes with great responsibility, when Ridley Scott was watching this movie he was probably laughingÂ
She becomes highly upset when learning one of her court maidens is having his baby.
She had God's divine protection when a firing squad was ordered to shoot her.
People always want to think that they were the first to do something, when things like profanity, substance abuse and prostitution have been around since before man walked erect.
Feminist wet dream of putting a tough masculine straight man in the position of a woman when handling the emotional and psycological problems brought upon them by a rape.
You know a man can go through the same thing a woman can go through when they are met by any kind of violent crime,being shot,getting carjacked,being robbed at gun point,getting mugged,it is always hard on the victim no matter who it is.
One example is when he tells Stevens his friend is dead then asks if he can make himself an ice cream soda.
I used the hypnotherapist Kyrah Malan, when she was in Sacramento and got great results with my goals.
I know that she works on a donation basis and does a lot of charity work not charging people for her services when she feels they really need the help and couldn't otherwise get it.
I had to laugh when they take the stack of Bibles and start reading the damning quotes from the Bible "in context".
I will just state this though, when it's their time to die and I hope thats soon cause their stupid asses shouldn't be shown on TV anymore they will find out that our consciousness survives bodily death everything unexplainable in this world points towards it.
The fact is that it is hard to take anything Penn and Teller propose seriously when they've let down the ideal of scientific fairness and objectivity on several occasions.
I mean, who listens to a magician when it comes to global warming and long term problems with genetic manipulation?
this show is horrible, and it becomes even more horrible when you realize that some people actually think that this show has a shred of credibility.
It's called creating fake accounts in order to not lose face when shopping around for financing.
it was bad  when i saw it in the theater 2 years ago, it is bad now.  
The best one is when Derrida rambles about how he'd love to know more about philosopers' personal lives because its so strange that they never speak about them.
Unfortunately I know very little more now about Derrida than I did when I came in.
During the Cultural Revolution photos (and most anything else like musical instruments, art, foreign clothing, books, or even nicer furniture) were not allowed and were destroyed or buried, as you could be severely punished for having them, since they were considered "foreign" I even heard of a lady putting her family photos in soup ( when her house was being searched by Red Guards) to get rid of them lest she be caught.
The most insulting part about the event was that when Dick and Kofman spoke to the audience answering questions, they intellectualized this all.
If you dont know Deconstruction before you go in, you wont know a thing about it when you leave.
The questions she (the director) asks are pitful and stupid and what I expect a student would ask, when put on the spot.
and people kept laughing when  The absolute worst parts of the movie are random shots with voiceovers reading from derrida's work.
That does get boring when done wrong.
(The inspector in the '25 film was that story's "hero"-- if you discount Erik himself, who despite his murderous antics was admirable right to the end, when justice and a murderous mob caught up with him.)
By (1976) when "Keoma" appeared on the scene, the "spaghetti western" had clearly become an exhausted genre.
I saw this movie on TBN, when they were playing it in honor of Nora Lam, of whom this movie is about.
The first comes five minutes into the film when a damaged B-17 is landing with one landing gear down.
and selecting a capable cast, the entire effort was shot in the head when it came time for the script - not to mention some model sequences which, in spite of emerging technology, still just flat don't 'work.'
Yes, I know that there were only five real ones and that most were not the correct model, but let's face it; when there are so few left of the thousands built, you take what you can get and be happy for it.
Good Western in which the Reno gangs raid bank ,treasure offices ,train,robberies in post-civil war Indiana.Stylish,fast paced,solid ,meticulous and a violent look with numerous shootouts.Randolph Scott leaving times ago the secondaries roles as when he was still playing supporting roles in top films as Â¨Jesse JamesÂ¨(Henry King), Â¨Virginia cityÂ¨(Michael Curtiz) and Â¨the spoilers'(Ray Enright).Scott also played an famed outlaw in Â¨Doolins of OklahomaÂ¨(Gordon Douglas).The support cast make equally notable performances.
The movie is a perpetual searching for his mother who left him in the door of a Catholic priest when he was a little baby.
It intrigues me when a director claims to be an auteur by leading the credits with " A Film By Eric DelaBarre," when it really should note that it's "The Film By Eric DelaBarre."
I'm not trying to be witty when I say that War of the Robots makes Starcrash look like Revenge of the Sith.
Basically a professor and his assistant are kidnapped and it's up to john (kirk ripoff) (god i hated that guy) and his crew to save them because apparently the aliens kidnapped at just the wrong time when if the professor's gone, the city will explode.
Wow, I don't believe it - the special effects are more than a decade out of date - strings show all over the place, especially when the captain goes floating through 'outer-space.'
Sure, it feels like a rip-off of "Star Wars," "Star Trek," "Dark Star," and even "Cave Dwellers" (which came a few years later), but it's low-budget fun in the same way that playing with "A-Team" action figures was fun when I was 5.
Made in the days when science fiction films were the worst film genre in the business, War of the Robots is an utter waste of time and the producer's nugget.
ACTING: $ (Antonio Sabato looks like he'd rather be doing anything other than taking part in this film but he grins when the script calls for it and issues the insipid lines of dialogue when asked).
The war begins when the Brian Joneses kidnap a slightly megalomaniacal college professor who seems to have a singular genius for mechanical and electrical engineering, nuclear physics and genetics.
One of the Reno family, Denver Pyle, has nothing to do with the crimes and Scott falls in love with Mala Powers, his sister, who is bitter and unhappy; of course when he turns out to be just another bank robber, she turns against him, despite their obvious attraction and his courtly manners.
Some suspense and excitement near the finale, but it's long and talky when it should have been a gripping docu-drama.
And be reminded that when the original series was canceled, a massive fan response got the show rebooted, this was their fan base.
Just what we need when condensing a year's worth of episodes into 90 minutes is to add a new character and subplot.
A music student, Kate Martin begins to personally investigate when her ex-husband, Mike becomes a suspect of attack upon a neighbour, Anna.
There are a few scenes that almost seem stolen from Halloween, such as when the killer is behind a washing line.
The acting was very bad, and when the ape lifts the cop car, that was just too ridiculous, it looked so fake, I think this film would have been better if a different approach to the ape was used, and they limited the blood and gore, the movie had potential and that's why I give it a three.
Colonel when he died, although I looked hard to see his rank, and couldn't see it.
The one tell tale sign that the writers of this film were on to the real Custer is when he said that Juan Pizzaro conquered the Inca Civilization with less than 200 men.
She's not very motivated to continue running the place and her reluctance even increases when strange occurrences take place on the estate.
The trappings are luxurious at Mrs. X's apartment, but things go sour almost immediately when Mrs. X's demands on Annie become excessive.
The only semi-bright spots are the icy rich mama played by the talented Linney ... when she flashes that smile or the stare, it does have some impact; and the power broker rich daddy played by the always excellent Giammatti - this time with a stuffy accent!
Recent college grad Annie Braddock (Scarlett Johansson) is all set for a career in business when she quite literally falls into a position as nanny for the four-year-old son (Nicholas Art) of a snooty, self-absorbed Upper East Side socialite named Alexandra X, played by a sadly miscast Laura Linney (among many of the movie's wearisomely cutesy touches is not giving a surname to the family that hires her).
All told, Johansson is really the only decent thing about "The Nanny Diaries" (well, little Nicholas Art is pretty cool too), but even her staunchest admirers would be well advised to look the other way when it comes to this film.
Far from "great paying", one big point the book makes is that the very rich are awful cheapskates when it comes to their "servants".
The sharpest detail of the novel is when Nan leaves the summer cottage, and Mrs. X has only paid her $50 for a whole week of 24/7 work -- because, after all, wasn't it a "free beach vacation"?
So when I heard about a movie adaptation I couldn't have been happier.
I have no problem when film adaptations of books are done differently, if I enjoy the book I might enjoy the movie as well no matter how much the film is changed, as long as those changes are positives one.
Check out the character of Randolf who starts off by speaking in a scouse accent then when he gets found out reverts to an Australian accent .
I was going to a lot of movies when this movie came out and I noticed in the paper a listing for Bad Moon.
A man, while having a sexual intercourse with his girlfriend, gets bitten by a werewolf, and his gf gets torn to shreds (yes, you've guessed it, she was in mid-orgasm when the beast attacked).
I saw it when it first aired, but I couldn't watch it again since it brings back such bad memories, plus it's so biased.
It's just too strange to watch a movie that is based on the real-life tragedy of people I know very well, especially when some of the facts and scenes are altered.
I hope when he is set free the producers come back to Baltimore and do a sequel to show just how wrong the first movie really was and show that he is innocent after all.
A rare thought provoking moment is when Suresh Oberoi's character questions Munna, about escaping responsibility.
Just when you are wondering - is there going to be a murder???
These films may have been crudely made but at least they were a realistic interpretation of the Afro-American way of life at a time when white America was still laughing at Stepin' Fechit.
So is a movie worth watching when the direction is even clunkier than the acting, when the acting with only one or two exceptions is embarrassingly amateurish, when the plot is chopped up and dull, when the jokes and comedy relief aren't just flat they're concave, and when the murder in the title is barely squeezed in 55 minutes into the 58 minute run time?
The only interesting camera angle I saw here was when it cut to the top of the judge's wig before he looked up and his face came in close-up.
That, and the orbiter cannot be launched into space from a 747, especially when it lacks the necessary rocket engines.
The only good episodes where when Don Knotts came on - because he naturally is great.
Don't be fooled by the friendly Andy Griffith, the show is really retarded when you look at it away from the TV screen.
Almost every show, when the prosecutor makes an objection based on hearsay or speculation, Matlock screams to the judge that his question is "absolutely vital to his case" and the judge lets it in.
There are several times when the film has a poetic beauty, the opening shot of Jesus on the Cross, and a few shots with in the crucifixion are quite stunning.
Being one of John Carpenters biggest fans, I am usually very biased when it comes to rating his movies (I loved Escape from LA).
Screenwriter David Seltzer went on record as not really believing in the stuff when he wrote "The Omen," but this tale of the End of Days is truly lacking in conviction from Joseph Vitarelli's clichÃ©d choral theme onwards (whatever you might think of "The Passion of the Christ," you can't deny that Mel Gibson genuinely put his money where his mouth is); instead of being thought-provoking and chilling, the first four hours are nothing but build-up with nothing going anywhere, and when it's not teasing you it's being ridiculous (ominous supermodels dressed in black hanging around?
The miniseries also lands us with two main characters - a relentlessly serious professor and a nun who would make Mother Teresa seem like a hedonist - who simply don't register (pity Bill Pullman, if not Natascha McElhone), leaving Michael Massee as a Satanic mass-murderer to prove that the Devil gets, if not the best tunes, at least the best lines; the dire job "Revelations" does can be summed up by a failure to care when our villain, having launched the plot by kidnapping and murdering Professor Pullman's young daughter, lures his unlikeable teenage son into his clutches (by way of a webcam fronted by a Christina Aguilera-type).
If nothing else, this does prove once and for all that when it comes to standing in for other countries, the Czech Republic is the Canada of Europe.
I have to admit when I first saw Fred Durst, I wasn't really sure if that was really him, I think I spent more time trying to figure out if it that was really him or not than I did trying to figure out how this show would end.
Since Charlotte's attire wasn't conservative and she was seen dancing with Jim and because she didn't physically struggle with Jim when he raped her, it is not surprising that no one believes her when she claims that his advances were unwanted especially since, by this point, Jim has already bragged to his entire fraternity about his encounter with Charlotte.
-- but when you've got such low-quality acting, cheesy effects, a meandering script ... blah!
So imagine my excitement when I started reading in genre magazines that a new Invaders was going to be made.
Though they had the outward appearance of being human, they were very different inside: They had an irregular skeletal structure, no heart, and no blood; when cut, they would not bleed.
It always makes me want to get a seasonal job at a department store when I watch this movie.
I saw this movie on cable when I was a kid, and I hated it.
Little Ricky Schroeder is vacationing with his folks in the Australian outback, when out of nowhere they are killed!!
I don't think I ever saw a horror film when I was little that upset me as much as this "family film" did!!
Even for folks who want to watch them - like myself - these Nazi sexploitation films are acknowledged as being pretty hard to surpass in terms of bad taste, so when one is executed as dumbly as SS Experiment Love Camp, it sort of topples over into a zone where it could easily be viewed as a complete insult to humanity.
There's almost no development, no suspense and no engagement value of any kind, except during the last twenty minutes, when they throw in the testicular transplant plot development which I haven't previously mentioned.
The purpose of the experiments is to find the best stud from this Aryan select and transfer his balls onto the camp commandant who, as we discover, lost his when a Russian woman he was raping bit his off.
Funny scene #2: The second hilarious scene begins when Helmut discovers, just as he is about to have sex, that he has no balls.
The only highlight in this movie, is when the hero has his testicles removed, so the Kommandant can have them implanted (he lost them on the front, to a russian girl).
They handle about an unpleasant substance, the production values are extremely poor and the videostore lady always looks at you like you're some kind of dangerous psychopath when you rent them.
This cheap little indie touches the semi-documentary bases at a time when Hollywood was boosting the image of federal agencies in general.
You get happy and excited for her when her life finally starts unfolding.
"The Hills Have Eyes Part 2" is truly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen.The plot concerns a bunch of annoying youngsters,who are attacked by cannibals:Pluto(Michael Berryman) and his uncle Reaper(John Bloom).Absolutely no suspense,even no gore to satisfy gore-freaks(although there's a nice throat slashing).The acting is diabolically obscure and the final twist is obnoxious and stupid.The scene when the pet dog has a flashback to the previous movie is extremely dumb,but also hilarious at the same time.Avoid this junk like the plague.Not recommended.
Thats when Ruby gets attacked by Pluto and kicks his a**.
The most effective scenes occur when it has the blind girl unknowingly stumbling across her dead friends.
I can never be sure what movie I am going to see when the names are the same.
I don't know what Wes Craven was thinking when he made this one.
Though Robert Houston (Bobby) is also on hand, his character is conveniently put out of the way at the very beginning: he freaks out when a motor race is set to take place in the desert near where his family was attacked all those years ago and opts to stay behind Â Ruby (who's even changed her name) and Beast, however, go along and, though the former's confession about her past isn't taken very seriously by her companions, both of course prove instrumental in the new victims' safe-keeping.
Incidentally, Craven knew when he had a good thing going and, so, reproduced here two death methods from the original Â Berryman himself, in fact, expires yet again at the hands of Beast (though he's met with the fate that had previously befallen his brother Mercury), while The Reaper's come-uppance is an even more elaborate and protracted stunt than Jupiter's demise in the 1977 film and which would have been more appropriate for a Road Runner cartoon!
Her wishes begin to come true, but they all have a slight twist to them when they do.
If you're looking for any incestuous, inbred, radioactively mutated hill killer like the first film this is certainly not the place to look for it; especially when the mutants in this film can drive motorcycles (stylishly so).
Sure, the hillbilly father in the original film could have kept something from Big Bob Carter and not told him of his other mutant offspring but it's just...illogical, especially when Reaper is so unintentionally funny.
For me, Craven is a hit-or-miss film maker but when you read up that he needed quick cash then you should be well aware of what you're in for; The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 is it.
Due to the fact the music of 'Hills 2' is composed by Harry Manfredini (who composed the incidental music for most of the Friday films), you could often be forgiven for wondering when Jason Voorhees is going to pop up.
They stupidly decide to take a shortcut, and when their bus breaks down, they end up in the same area where the first film took place where they're set upon by two survivors of the cannibal family.
There is also too little happening and when there is something happening it isn't being very effective, due to its build-up and overall story.
It looked as if they approached the cheapest and most worthless actress and paid her an extra $50 to bare her ugly breasts when no such thing was due, needed, or fitting at all.
For example, when Lizzard is holding a machete but you can only watch his boots.
Will buy when it is as I can't say enough about the film.
I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw The Hills Have Eyes Part II at Blockbuster, I didn't even know that Wes had created a sequel from his brilliant classic.
You know you can't take a movie seriously when even the dog has flashbacks!
You know a sequel is bad when the only good scenes in it are the flash-backs to the original film!
Speaking for myself I can truthfully say that no teachers save one ever did anything for me hormonally back when I was a student.
So when he attempts a rape and gets no for an answer it's damaging to his ego.
I'm sure that by now most people are aware that IMDb reviews are a breeding ground for hype from the people involved in the film itself, if not then beware of all the high ratings/reviews a lesser known film receives, especially early on when the film's newly/barely even been released.
It has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it on ABC Family Channel when it first come out.
You know, to be honest I was sitting there watching Broken & I was just thinking to myself when Hope slashed the back of that guy's leg but he still had her back didn't he realise things were not going to work out?
Also when Hope was trying to break the door down why didn't Jennifer say anything?
There is no explanation about where they are and how the women have been kidnapped and transported to the middle of nowhere; Hope is an imbecile, and I do not understand how her character does not kill the sadistic maniac when she has the chance and after being tortured the way she had been; the schoolgirl screaming all the time is really irritating, provoking the nasty situation with her tongue.
And we're supposed to believe this guy has been living in the woods when he's wearing clothes that looked like they were freshly bought off the rack from some new Western store.
The first scene had a woman go through torture to stay alive only to kill herself when she got through the hard part.
Yet, the main point of the story is how everything came together for her when she decided not to 'wait' for anything anymore.
It was only when Melody stopped wishing and actually did something that all the pieces fell into place: like going to that swanky restaurant even though she had no escort, and joining in the fun with the other diners.
Some eye-candy to watch when you come home on a Friday night after an exhausting week.
We also get confused signals to just what happened to Amanda when she's later murdered in her parked car outside the Marlin Bay Club.
You figured that she must have been with the bartender, off camera when she walked to her car?
Why then go by herself when Amanda was so terrified to leave the club with Yule snooping around outside?
The movie gets even more confusing when the off-the-wall Yule after threatening Tom, by phone, at the textile factory is later shot to death by the police as they catch him trying to break into the Deese's house.
My favourite part of this sequel is when Kiara & Kovu are playing together.
Imagine my dismay when their cruel parents separated them.
Simba (Matthew Broderick, again) is now The Lion King and has wife Nala and a new daughter Kiara to be Queen, she is voiced by Scream's Neve Campbell when she is older.
It's all much better to watch when you're a kid, though.
The first one always made me cry even when I was older plus the music and visuals were cool so it made it a really good film but this one isn't.
The Lion King is a great film and the whole family was keen when I rented Simba's Pride.
Myles Jeffrey can't act yet, and his eye movements during times when other actors are feeding him lines are distracting.
I like a good vampire film as much, if not more so, than the next person so imagine how I felt when I had the misfortune to see this so called 'artistic' effort.
You see, when Wes Craven includes a character named Van Helsing, it can be a bit of a gas.
It is funny, mildly relevant, a bit respectful, and ultimately lost in the wake when the film provides some genuinely frightening moments.
Boris Karloff's character is somewhat the patriarch of this island, and he certainly doesn't like it when an ambitious police lieutenant arrives to clean up the place.
The zombies look deader than when they actually dead, so certainly don't expect any brain-devouring monsters that hunt down everything that moves.
I just recently purchased this movie Snake People, and when finished I was just as confused as at the beginning.
There are times when I thought this was a comedy.
I will admit that I was finishing an "art" project for the first fifteen minutes or so, but even then, when I wasn't really paying attention, I could tell that this was going to be a terrible movie.
I laughed a lot when I saw this movie the first time, and I will definitely watch it again.
Either way, the fact remains that someone actually financed this tripe after reading the script, actors thought it was worth reciting this awful dialogue and somebody had the brains to release it on video when the negative should have been quietly thrown in a nearby dumpster.
Ford is so picky and methodological when picking scripts it makes you wonder how this ever appealed to him.
I have a hard time believing Ford gave a crap about this movie, when he can't even convey that he cares about his wife or family.
It is not realistic at all which is obvious but sometimes people forget that when they watch this type of movie.
There are no hysterics, no tears and no signs of any inner emotional struggle when strangers threaten her with guns.
Stick to Jack Bauer, Mary, and I'll stick to television when I want a good thriller.
I wish Hitchcock knew what would follow when he dreamt up this ruse for The Man who knew too Much (1934).
Occasionally when he's stretching artistically a script lets him do both!
He pretty much runs the gamut of emotions from highly enraged to enraged when he plays these roles, be they in "Frantic" (1998), "Patriot Games" (1992) or "Air Force One" (1997), all of which I enjoyed far more than "Firewall."
No one knows what to do when the kid answers that dreaded telephone so they all flip out, point weapons and look scared.
The exposition in this film is so obvious - like the family dog who appears in the beginning of the film and is gone again until about 1/3 through when the mom seemingly needlessly points out the dog's special GPS tracking collar.
But of course this bit of exposition sure does pay off in the end when the kidnappers take off with family in tow.
For example, the family dog Rusty, plays a prominent role when the bumbling fools take him hostage.
I will first point out that I do not go out of my way to watch this show but when I do sit down and watch I find it quite enjoyable and at times very funny.
This invariably leads to them having better story lines and when they do get a great story line none of the actors involved of making the plot work.
The actors who play the characters, with the exception of Ma, are terrible and their characterizations when compared to their loyalist counterparts I consider to be very lazy.
Since the movie failed to attract much of an audience when released, its title was changed.
Even the IMDb is confused and when you click the Amazon VHS link for "Forbidden Zone" you end up with "Alien Abduction".
Meredyth Holmes gets the most screen time and has one of those strange faces that looks gorgeous when framed by a hat and rather ordinary otherwise (maybe her horrible haircut and dye job).
They describe passionate fantasies to each other that somehow fail to be passionate when cut in as flashbacks.
Nothing against Judge Reinhold, he's a decent enough actor when it comes to lighter fare like fathers inhabiting their sons bodies or flinging coffee into a robbers face but in this film we're expected to believe that Judge Reinhold is an ex-Black Ops Officer?
Sure, there are a great amount of high spots when you look at film technique (such as the moving camera in part two that zooms in over the heads of the crowds - and the grand sets of Babylon are stunning to say the least) but the film is a mishmash of ideas that are forced into employment as examples of 'Intolerance' when you could view alternate characters as equally displaying the trait.
I suppose a couple of moments work in the film, but I am guessing that is by accident when compared to so much else that didn't work.
The plot is, besides non-existing, stupid stupid and stupid, and the fighting scenes were already made in the first movie (except when the only two female characters of any significance fight in a pool of mud).
I'm a fan of the game, and was excited when hearing of the movie coming out, and then a sequel, right on!
This movie was truly the bottom of the barrel when it comes to Hollywood.
I had a bad feeling in the back of my brain when they replaced him with a...well...character that not only looked wimpy, but acted like a fly-swatter.
Believe me when I say ANYTHING is better than watching this garbage!
The only good one was when Raiden was fighting all the Reptiles, that was actually pretty cool.
I watched the original Mortal Kombat when I was about 10 years old, and it was bloody brilliant to me back then, it's still "ok" not absolute garbage, unlike its sequel.
So I was like..."Damn, this is a glorified power rangers..." I could see from the start it was, when Raiden fires lighting at the beginning, it looks as though someone has put a giant bitmap overlaid onto the movie and moved it around a bit.
MKA however became a pastime for us at University, when we were in that frame of mind, to throw it on and laugh ourselves silly with the absolute shambles that is this film.
I made the mistake of going to see this movie, first show, first day, in the theater, in 1997 when it was released.
So we have characters from all 4 games running around and interacting, which is goofy as it is, and things get worse when sense is tried to be made of it.
There's nary an actual hand-to hand combat scene that lasts more than 30 seconds, and when you see what else was thrown in instead, you'll want to kill someone yourself.
Things (don't) pick up later on, when Liu Kang randomly encounters Native American character Nightwolf, who explains that Liu must harness his "animality" to succeed.
It comes to something when you look at a film and can honestly say the best actor in it is Brian Thompson!
Clearly nobody would go into this expecting much more, but the fact that this is pointless gets more annoying when you consider that it's also rather dull and none of the characters are interesting.
But during the first half of the movie we see various shoots from the bank robbery, when the robbery itself has little importance.
But this finale -- as a whole -- was disappointing, especially when the previous episode, "Static," suggested a huge pay-off was on the horizon.
But when a show as maverick as Six Feet Under has such a TV-typical finale, one has to speculate on exactly what caused such a tragedy.
However, the movie falls short when it comes to telling Team Canada's story and creating an engaging story that tries to explain and uncover the particular dynamics of this great series.
Heck, I even felt like rooting for the Russians at some points (like when Clarke is ordered to immobilize the Russian star forward).
However, when the movie already has a hard time explaining why we should care about these players the goon aspect just makes us even less likely to sympathize with them.
Great for a comedown Sunday when you're brain is shot to bits, but that's it.
Different lighting...different mountain, different snow, but what does it matter when you get a good chuckle.
I am not kidding when I say that two damsels in distress get harassed at a dive bar by a gang (leather jackets, motor-huckle boots, you name it) that has driven up to the bar.
Oh man, I have to give credit where it's due, because when this scene unfolded before my eyes, it was the equivalent of cinemtic masturbatory bliss!
I guess that wasn't good enough when it was released in 2004, so they renamed it and brought it out again in 2006 as a story of greedy people after $300,000.
The kind of film that you spend 30% of your life watching, because you can't help yourself... especially when you have nothing to do late at night except to channel surf and watch B movies...  Good premise of a film, got me interested, forgave the cheesy acting, didn't mind the simple FX, but the script was real bad.
I just wasted 5.50 cents renting this movie when i could have rented a nice Xbox game.
Ah, the old days when movies were really, really bad.
Since the time of The Day The Earth Stood Still, when all Klaatu wanted to do was give the Earth leaders a groovy gift and got thanked by having it shot out of his hand, and in a multitude of other films since, Hollywood has taught us that when we are confronted with something of superior intellect, or of mysterious origins, if we don't understand it, if it doesn't look like a fluffy kittie, we are to shoot first, and ask questions later.
The only good thing I can say about this movie is it would be great to show when you have a few friends round so you can pick it to bits for fun.
"Celebrity" is about three childhood friends who are bound to each other for life due to a tragic event which occurred when they were teens.
This mini-series actually got quite a few good reviews when it first appeared on TV.
I was intrigued ,when I first read the plot outline and saw the ratings here on IMDb , so I decided to watch it.
I didn't think much of this when I first saw it and don't think much of it now.
To me, the only really good parts were when they found Angus with the sheep and, of course, the sheep killing all the people at Angus's presentation.
What was he thinking when he agreed to be in this horrible movie??!!
I won't say anything more about what's in this movie, but during a time when Neil Armstrong put his foot on the moon, the success of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was still strong, and there was a cold war (see the opening cartoon for what I mean), MOON ZERO TWO was slapped together to cash in on all of it.
High point includes fighting in zero gravity and when everyone is killed when the airlock opens (just kidding, though wish it happened).
Peter Hyams had the good sense to forego such puerile shenanigans when he made his own 'Space Western' with Sean Connery, OUTLAND (1981).
thing when the actors appear.
For one, it offers nothing new to the genre, all of the actors are wooden and look constipated when having to display fear.
After co-eds begin turning up murdered around the campus, Jeff Kramer (Ken Roberts) is immediately put in the frame when it is revealed that he was the last person to see one of the victims before she was slaughtered.
Part of the story involves an un-engaging romance between the two emotionless leads, and there are plenty of inadvertent laughs to be had when the couple go cycling to the strains of an eighties pop monstrosity.
I had never heard of popples or this show when I was a kid.
The identikit, do everything killer is so bad it really is funny and Madsen and Penn spend the whole movie being over the top and macho when they should be taking fingerprints and watching smarter, techically competent movies of the genre.
It loses its edge about halfway through, when Joey starts being nice, Vera starts being nice, the puppy is nice, and everyone gets to live happily ever after--what a precious moment!!!
Someone needs to seriously get someone new to head up the programming for SciFi, someone with the ability to tell someone no when they hear a bad idea.
I can also understand the need to draw in the young adult demographic, but having the tweenaged girl be a complete genius and outthink the adults in almost every scene smacks of badly written Mary Sue fanfiction, especially if the concerned father seriously makes such a stupid decision as to take the kid into the heart of the war in Iraq(wearing bright pink no less), let alone repeatedly exposing the kid to an invulnerable monster when there's a perfectly good hidden sanctuary where she'd be safe.
However his performance is practically Oscar worthy when compared with that given by his real-life mum, Filomena Spagnuolo: she plays his on-screen mother and somehow even struggles to make this role convincing!
Most effective element is the parodying of the supposedly glamorous industry of film festivals, where people think everything is a publicity stunt (even when persons go missing and top actresses hysterically run through the hotel lobby only dressed in a towel).
One knows one is in trouble the minute the film begins, when one is assaulted by an insipid rock-and-roll (circa 80s) song instead of a witty or tuneful Mancini score.
One knows one is in further trouble when there is not one single note of Mancini music in the film, even though he receives credit for Original Music.
Of course, what one comes to realize are that these "reviews" are written by people who were kids when they saw the films in question - and when that's the scenario, they love everything they saw as kids.
You can pretty much guess my feelings of this movie when I say that the two best things about it are the movie's title and the presence of Edwige Fenech.
The mood is still there but it's impact is lost when seeing in WS.
I immediately recognized as 1 of 2 movies that I saw when I was a starving (pretty much literally) student living away from home for the first time, in 1973, and couldn't resist picking it up and giving it a look, that many years later.
In a time when viruses are a real threat to humanity, its hard to get scared by a poodle and a Labrador running wild in a forest.
Having heard so much about it online, The Mad Death ultimately turned out to be a disappointment when I finally obtained it on DVD.
I'm not sure when I'll be able to keep food down again.
I also choked on my drink when a certain person died from being bitten a couple times.. sheesh, I survived bike accidents with more wounds than he had!
I expect blood and guts when I watch these movies, which there is very little of here.
Xena, where are you when we need you?
But that's not good when we're supposed to be enjoying the locusts.
Probably the dumbest scene in the whole movie is when they're in the helicopter and Lawless starts trying to kill everybody.
It was guffaw time for me when he walked into Command Central and was introduced as a leader in some sort of scientific field.
You know when you pass by a car wreck and you know that it's something bad, but you just have to look at it.
The only reason that I'm giving it a four is because the Locusts actually look really good when grouped up and close-ups are real Locusts.
cutting short what should have been a romantic interlude with her chiseled-torsoed boyfriend (played by the wooden Dylan Neal), who whines like a child about how her prestigious Washington position takes her from his bed; the school bus scene when the daughter of the locusts' breeder calls for her daddy; the meeting with the USDA and the Dept.
of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
They should have taken clues from the newest Resident Evil (that latest tag-along gal DUCKS when you tell her to and automatically gets out of the way of the weapons when you're trying to attack.)
I found myself cursing more than usual at any time when I play a SH game, and the fun level deteriorated rapidly after she joined up with me.
I simply play up to the part when she joins and then lose interest every time.
The film benefits from stylish cinematography and a pleasant funky score, but when the killer appears, we hear the strange sound of a knife thrown into a piece of wood.
The first sign that this movie going down hill fast is when James Brolin asks Hal Holbrook 'how many people know about this' and Hal replies something like 'only a few' but we have already seen about 75 people involved which later turns into about 750.
The second worrying sign is when we realise that OJ has a speaking part.
We start to ask questions like how does a car accelerate like it's on a hill in San Fransisco when it's on what looks like a flat stretch of road in Houston with no foot on the gas and why when Elliot Gould is arrested by the conspirators on a fake charge is he released the same night to continue his investigations.
Things start to go wrong, however, when, on the return journey, their spacecraft burns up while re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.
What is never made entirely clear is whether Kelloway planned from the beginning to murder the astronauts so they could never expose his deception, or whether he originally intended to let them live but changed his plan when the spacecraft burnt up on re-entry.
We are then asked to accept that the one acquaintance who does notice also has powers of deduction that make Sherlock Holmes look like a rank amateur and is able to work out precisely what has happened to the missing astronauts from the most tenuous of clues (such as the puzzled look of one of the astronauts' wives when her husband mentions where they spent their last family holiday).
One of them is when the unfunny guy meets his blind date.
I couldn't relate to the humor, if indeed humor was the aim, and when Chris Tuker speaks I get angry.
My response, no the movie sucks why watch a movie that I already know sucks when I can watch one that doesn't suck like Varsity Blues.
Obviously Sonny Tufts was really hitting the bottle when he appeared in this film.
This theme was so successful that it has been repeatedly followed right up to today when everyone has a much more sophisticated understanding of the realities of space.
Scientific improbability returns when they travel back to the surface wearing casual sports clothes and encounter a fairly normal gravitational pull.
But when Sarah Jessica Parker, as a recurring character on a children's show, started singing about how she was my 'extraordinary friend', I lost it.
Things get real bizarre when Megan thinks she is being contacted by her sister from beyond the grave.
Well, those are the words that come to my mind when I think of Solstice.
Maybe I'll try it again, but if you've ever seen Downtown created by Chris Prynoski, I think you'll find that this doesn't compare when it comes to humor.
I was surprised at how cute Alan Arkin really was when he wasn't in "Wait Until Dark"!
I remember when I first saw this and thought "Whoa, Rutger must be pretty embarrassed to have done this", well, he did get to do a pretty hot chick in this one, and it's surprisingly graphic, with only penetration the only part of the act not directly shown!
Do you know the feeling, when you'd like to turn the clock back to the moment you came home from work and decide what to do with your "rare" sparetime?
Could this be any further from the truth when we consider the Media blanket placed during the conflict.
The acting is over the top and frankly awful, neither one of my friends with combined army experience of over 20 years who experienced both gulf wars had ever experienced moments when their troops had lost their heads at all during combat, no where near as much as the characters in this show where!
Again, maybe this is a fine chapter in a longer story when viewed with the other Saint films, in order.
Although she was past being a teenager when the original silent version of "The Road to Ruin" (1928) was made, beautiful Helen Foster (as Ann Dixon) is still an innocent young thing.
After hanging out with bad girl Nell O'Day (as Eve Monroe), Ms. Foster begins to smoke, drink, and have sex - nothing too unusual, when you consider the characters routinely being played by the likes of Bette Davis, Greta Garbo, and Mae West.
Don't wanna give spoilers, but when you grab what the movie is about, you will realize it doesn't necessarily have a happy ending, and that's what keeps you on the edge all the time.
I sat through it ONCE when it was on TV, never again.
I was a kid when I first saw it, but when it was on TV a couple years ago I realized how confusing it was because they're twins and you think both of them are equally hot, but Stew has the best hair, but Phil is better because the ranger girl wants to go out to the forest to eat worms (like the gross white maggot kinds!
A whole lot of work when he could just use some machinery to re-route the water.
In short, the Catholic Church has been hiding and supporting the fugitive, because they have also been guilty of anti-semitism, and they believe that he just obeyed orders when he killed 7 Jews and later repented.
The Caine character is interesting because he has touching moments (like when he leaves money and a penitant, caring, thankful note for his estranged wife) and seems genuinely emotional, open and desperate at times.
To be fair, there is a little nod to France with the occasional French accent, when pronouncing French names.
And now adding more content to satisfy IMDb's requirements: Michael Caine plays an ex-Nazi French collaborator; he "acts" exceedingly nervous throughout the film helped no doubt by the liberal application of some oil-based lubricant to his face; Church officials are of course portrayed as deeply corrupt and dishonest, protecting their pro-fascist sympathies until the heat gets turned on them when naturally they sell out their own man, and so on.
D.H.Lawrence, James Joyce, Gustave Flaubert, Leo Tolstoi were all censored for "Lady Chatterly's Lover", "Ulysses", "Madame Bovary", and "The Kruezer Sonata" when they came out, but today these books seems very run-of-the-mill in terms of their steaminess.
Wesley Snipes stars as Dean Gage, an ex soldier who has emotional baggage, however when he is injected with a truth serum, Gage finds himself vulnerable and the bad guys on his trail, but who can he trust?
The main thing is that Snipes should have said no when someone put the script on his lap, I imagine it had grubby fingerprints and jam stains on it or something, or came in an X-files folder with scribblings all over the front.
One has to wonder what in the world was going on in Wesley Snipes's head when he accepted this stinker.
Wesley Snipes used a stunt man to perform a kick, since when does he use a stunt man to kick, I know Wesley isn't that old.
Lifting several cliched ideas from The Omen and Amityville Horror, London Voodoo tells the tale of an unlikely American couple who move to London in an attempt to salvage their relationship, but whose fortunes take a turn for the worse when they discover that their new home is haunted by a voodoo spirit.
Also worthy of note are the businessmen in the office scenes, which demonstrate that when Pratten is not trying to make a load of spookery convince, he's actually quite a good writer/director.
The "plot" only just starts to unfold itself after an hour into the film, when a courageous boy stands up against the vicious gang but then gets falsely accused, threatened and targeted for vengeance.
Moral of the story: look the other way when violence is being committed near you!
It is very weird and entertaining; it has some great thrills and the audience will find themselves smiling at certain moments when they have a sense of.
I wanted to like Martha Gehman's character as Brown's assistant, but she lost me with her gleeful "I wish I could have seen the look on his face" when she tricked the pursuing detective into thinking he had run over a woman.
But doesn't the old man have to provide identification when he crosses the border?
Sylvia's character development also suffers, as it's difficult to understand why she loves her father so much when he never cared about *her* welfare.
Ditto at the start of the film when she's still a girl - she's more demure and softspoken, but the high pitch of her voice mostly succeeds in conveying YOUTH, moreso than GENDER.
And, when he wasn't blubbering and acting foolish, Hepburn was doing much the same!
The only decent scenes in the film occurred when Sylvia fell in love with the artist.
As if there was a chance that when he opened his suitcase the diamonds would come out of his shoe.
And then, 5 minutes later, when they are in London, he is completely broke and so are they.
Without any clue, we suddenly watch Henry dreaming and yelling out Maudie's name as if he were her "beau", and when he wakes we suddenly realize by the way he is treating her, that he really is her boy.
What can one say about a movie like this?I feel like I've been in a pillowfight,where all of the pillows were soaked in Ether.I can't believe anyone thought that this would be a good idea.Apparently some of those guys in Hollywood,drank too much wood alcohol during prohibition.I still can't believe I saw this.OK,imagine this,if you will:A Roy Roger's style western,complete with its stupid translucent plot line,extremely lame acting,pathetic special effects(assuming there are any),lousy stunts,silly slapstick comic relief,and horrific,lunatic singing.Now,shrink all of the characters down to 1/3 their normal size.And,Viola' you have,the Terror of Tinytown.Sort of a Roy Rogers on acid,if you will(or if you won't).Although, in all honesty, when I first saw the "cowboys" riding around on shetland ponies,I nearly busted a gut laughing so hard.But, other than that,its pretty much a waste of time.
Well, despite being a very bad and offensive film, in a way it was still oddly fun when it wasn't being creepy.
In a "Bevis and Butthead" sort of way, I suppose most people might smile when they first see the diminutive actors and actresses riding tiny ponies and acting like "normal" Western actors--though this enjoyment is a bit unsettling when you think about it!
I was particularly amazed at Curtis' horsemanship when he stopped the runaway midget stage coach.
But I was unable to dismiss the stature of the actors amid much of the non-dwarfed surroundings: There is a point when a saloon singer is obscured by a bannister as she descends a staircase.
Not surprisingly, when you put an all-midget cast in a "B" western, you get a "B" western starring midgets.
This evaded me when it first came out.
Especially when he is quizzing someone.
The passing in and out of realities begs the question of what will happen to the characters when they make it back?
The main reason it is a classic, of course, is that the cast is made up entirely of little people (or midgets, as they were referred to back in the 1930's, when this movie was made.)
Ok, so when I voted I gave it a low score, but that was cause Terror of Tiny Town has very little cinematic merit.
I saw this in the theater when it was released (getting truly rave reviews in New York newspapers) and was baffled by this extra-slow version of La Ronde or of one of Woody Allen's many comic movies (but with two quite physically unattractive lead characters).
The furnishings are nice - including the sets in the play within the play, the references to Goldoni, Pirandello and Heidegger obviously intrigued me when I first saw it, but the only reason to see this film is the appeal of the enthusiastic, vivacious, lovely, gracious Helene de Fougerolles - and it's not enough to watch this slow-moving unfunny dud.
There was no emotion or excitement when she was on stage prompting me to question whether she was this 'infamous' actress that they claimed her to be.
I had never heard of this movie, but it appeared on cable and when I saw the cast, I figured "how bad could it be?".
Estevez is great in this movie, and the real laughs start when he gets busted by the cops.
I had no need to hear what Gore Vidal had to say, particularly when he went on about Lennon representing "life" and Nixon and George Bush representing "death".
Above everything else, it is always a pleasure to listen to Lennon, even when he wasn't thinking much about what he said.
What we have here is another "modern classic" which looked much better when it came out, but failed to stand the test of time.
It's not a good sign when the secondary plot takes the cake, relegating the core of the story to a role of pretty-but-shallow dressing.
Of course he succeeds, when in reality this guy would have had as much chance of winning the day as he would have had successfully hang gliding off of Mt.
Watch this once, preferably with the MST3K coverage to get you through the roughest spots, on a lazy Sunday afternoon when you are too hungover or sleepy to watch anything more ambitious.
And even when it was established that you could interfere with the past, the movie explored the theme that you cannot change the past, which would've also been adequate, but we all know this is Hollywood.
I mean when I think of all the people naive enough to believe that this movie contained actual snuff footage, I laugh my ass off.
The script was apparently based on the real life case of William Grone & the 2 and a half minutes of footage that was found when police raided his house, this footage is supposedly presented at the end with a warning that 'veiwer discretion is advised' but this so-called real footage is probably the most fake & unbelievable scene in the whole film.
The whole film goes to plan exactly as one would expect & when there's a clichÃ©d flashback that suggests Grone's current state is down to childhood abused you realise there really is nothing here that you haven't seen before & that The Great American Snuff Film really isn't going anywhere new or revolutionary.
Horror movies buffs will be very disappointed with this flick.It is never never frightening,and the derivative screenplay borrows from "the exorcist" "Rosemary's baby" "the tenant" "the omen" and more.The first scenes ,notably the moment when the young couple enters their brand new flat (complete with a fountain in the yard) where a man committed suicide directly comes from Ira Levin/Roman Polanski 's story.All in all it is rather a -very soft -erotic movie where Lisa B. tries her best to be at once sexually attractive and threatening.The lines are very vulgar and use the word "f...." a lot more than they should.Do not bother.
They are cute but largely devoid of personality and the times when 'Hollywood Capers' comes to life are when they are not on screen.
There are a couple of fun but ever-so brief skits with caricatures of W.C. Fields and Charlie Chaplin at the beginning of the short and when Frankenstein's monster enters the narrative he gets to perform a camera-eating and self-repairing routine which is the highlight of the cartoon.
Scare Tactics was entertaining for the first two minutes of each show when Shannen Doherty was on.
For instance, when the killer has his two adversaries right in front of him and walks away without checking to see if they are dead, it isn't smartly written.
With that premise, the film could have been A LOT better  Unfortunately, one of the waxworks is, as I mentioned, based on "Return of the living Dead" or some other zombie movie, and there is only one thing you can do when faced with a horde of zombies.
this is one bizarre movie.it's sick and twisted and perverse.and it has to be dun tongue in cheek.there's just no way this was s opposed to be a serious movie.i guess you could call it a black comedy/horror-if you really wanted to.most of the movie is atrocious,including the very hammy overacting,the even worse dialogue and the even worse than that script.yet it is oddly(very oddly,)entertaining at points,and very boring at others.it's between 95 and 97 minutes,depending on whether you watch the rated or unrated edition,not including credits.the one positive thing about this movie is that the makeup effects weren't half bad.still,i'm glad it ended when it did.i don't think i could've taken anymore inane dialogue.the most i ca give this thing is a 4/10,for it's entertaining moments.
Rachel is apparently the one who caught Patrick Bateman and killed him when she was a young girl, something that was never mentioned anywhere in the first film.
I apologize for being mean, but it's a bad idea to have a voice-over narrative when your actress has a terrible lisp.
I have to admit that there are some errors (the-country-hurt-my-feelings explanation for the bad guy turned to a terrorist is at the least laughable, the time-travel theories cannot be minimized into a 2 minutes analysis such as portrayed here), but after all, when you see a film of this kind you do not expect everything to be clear as the stars in the night sky (without clouds of course).
It is like this scenario; Artist A does a painting, Artist B does their own painting, but then places scenes and subjects from the work of Artist A. I am not sure how long this sequel was in planning or when it was decided, but thats the situation as I see it.
As far as I am concerned we left the world of Bateman in the novel when the final page was turned (even though I never read it properly), and in the film when the end credits began rolling.
If that was the part when you were supposed to laugh or cry, i'd not know which one to do!
i still can't believe when business in America count on American stupidity...they win...because it's true...how could anybody misinterpret such a concise ending...how exactly do you feed a kitten to an atm anyway...arrrrgghhhh.
Sure, the stolen identity idea works, just about, but even that falls apart when we consider that college records usually include photos of the students.
Give me a concrete answer on why there's two of him (and how he makes it back to the future when it hasn't worked before--why this time?
My last huge qualm about the movie is- when he heads towards the bayou at the end, he's in SUCH a hurry - yet - at the girl's house they spend so much time bandaging him and are in no hurry.
Realising this unlikely scenario the director wisely often cuts to a different scene when Rachael bumps off a victim .
But this doesn't stop other massive plot holes like the police not checking for DNA when the victim of a car crash is found at the end of the movie   AP2:AAG is yet another cynical attempt to sell a stupid movie as a " Black comedy " but this is done in an even more cynical manner since it's a serial killer screenplay marketed as the sequel to a totally unrelated movie .
The movie keeps you waiting for something to happen and then disappoints when it does.
He just happens to pull over to look at horses when his car blows up.
he didn't have it when he ran back onto the ferry.
For example, when there is meaningful use of shadow, it is only to produce simple silhouettes.
My jaw dropped when I saw a 1958 Ford and that "Jackie Kennedy-esquire" dress worn by Agnes Morehead at "the afternoon tea".
The cold reaction of the women in the mansion when their close friend Judy Hollander dies due to the insistence of Dale Bailey to leave their locked room is a shame.
(I guessed it when I noticed it was supposed to be taking place in Kansas City, Altman's home town.)
I know I was in trouble when it starts off with a narrator telling the audience that this is a cautionary tale of where their kids might end up!
It's horribly edited with inappropriate music cues (there's some thundering music when Scotty just comes out of a cab!).
Also the script has lapses--especially when Bill inexplicably wants to help Scotty.
All the actors were unknowns when this was made.
The only one that went on to become famous was Laughlin when 15 years later he did "Billy Jack".
Of course, there is no one better than Tony Scott when it comes to telling a story with pictures, and he's as good here, if not better than in Enemy of the State.
Still it did make me chuckle a couple of times, laugh once and cry lots when after ten minutes discovered it still wasn't over...
Trent (Brian O'Connor) and Jimmy (Cameron Smith) are two Nam vet buddies who escaped a POW prison camp only to face worse horrors at home when the past literally comes back to haunt them.
They're harassed by a soldier they left behind and a sadistic traitor who helped torture them, and when they're attacked in their dreams, they emerge with real scars (a la A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET).
I was very surprised to see that this movie had such a good rating, when i checked it on IMDb after seeing it.
It looks like a good movie in the beginning, but when he comes into surgery i couldn't believe how bad it got.
If you didn't burst out in laughter yet, you will surely start to when you see the surgical scenes.
There were more people in the room when my wisdom tooth was getting pulled.
Sam Goldwyn, ever understanding, cut him from the payroll when he failed to show up for a couple of days.
Our meany terrorist quotes Thomas Jefferson, claims he's not killing people because the U.S. military hurt his feelings when they rejected him for being "too much" of a patriot (I kid you not), and all he wants when he's captured is to confess like he's talking to a priest.
But when our fearless hero, Denzel Washington, goes back in time the energy problem miraculously disappears.
Keep in mind, when most people recover from going into cardiac arrest, they are usually not strong enough to waltz out of the hospital a couple of HOURS later!
That's when I gave up.
Believe me when I say 5.4 is WAY TOO HIGH A SCORE to be believed!
Sam Goldwyn's creative juices must have been frozen when he came with the idea of this film, a bad remake of the more successful "Ziegfeld Follies".
And when I try to watch their movies and enjoy their brilliant anarchistic comedy I get stupid, irrelevant songs that interrupt my enjoyment at regular intervals.
That's especially valid when you consider most cartoons from this era also assumed children were idiots and were so cutesy-poo that nowadays they seem not only silly but sickening.
I realize this is a low budget film, so when we see the crime scene and it's two "FBI" guys, a guy digging in the garbage who is apparently unfamiliar with the term "contanimating evidence" and an ambulance (which serves no purpose at all, the director must have known someone who works at an ambulance service), it's clearly evident there was no budget.
The only resemblance was when Jo says the familiar "Christopher Columbus!"
Hurdle's crooked buddy that visits the school with him gets his coat stuck in the school safe when he accidentally opens it.
It's particularly annoying when characters are made stupid so that screenwriter get the story the way he wanted.
But even when he was sent to the past, after the girl's rescue, the screenwriter created suspense by making characters once again stupid and complicating everything.
Why didn't Denzel try to contact ATF and just warn to abort that ferry travel so that they could safely dismantle the bomb, without risking all that people's life... Well i'll answer that, because screenwriter wanted to break people's heart after his death, just when love between he and "Claire" (Paula Patton) had been set.
Then when the movie gets to the subject matter that was advertised, we're subjected to a few "gross you out just because" parts.
But when a movie with no plot is injected with a few gross-out scenes just to make it more like a successful movie of its kind it gets to the point of the viewer being insulted.
Every event has to MEAN something to the plot but when you don't have a plot that creates a problem.
I'm not sure what Eli Roth and Quentin Tarentino were thinking when they put this crap together, but it's a laughable attempt at a shocking horror film.
Creative writing professor Jack Harrel, in his essay "What Violence in Literature Must Teach Us," defines violence as gratuitous when it is "free, unearned, or unjustified.
How is this suspenseful feeling supposed to happen when the characters are constantly saying crude things like "you're so gay" and "pu**y" and taking pictures on their phone of their sexual exploits in a bar bathroom stall, and screaming when a male character puts his hand on their leg?
We care not when some of the people who are doing the killing get killed because we are not sure if they are the ones in charge.
When the main character rescues her from the hands of the killer due to her screaming, which reminds him of when he let a little boy drown a few years ago, we are surprised to find her in the "green killing room".
But when she takes a look at her reflection and then throws herself in front of a train in very dramatic fashion I become upset.
And when the pay-as-you-torture psychos pause to bare their souls to bound and bleeding victims, these scenes visit real torture upon moviegoers in the painful forms of pathetic acting and pitiful dialog.
I usually like sci-fi when it's pure sci-fi.
I usually like present day drama when it's believably real.
Disaster, at least for me, looms large when sci-fi meets real life drama.
Roth himself later claimed to make this film "to show Americans' ignorance of the world around them" and in the process only shows his own ignorance when it comes to film-making.
But it never happens and when the lid, towards the end, slowly slides off on its own accord it turns out that the ones you suspected were bad guys were in fact...bad guys.
The two girls and guy who set them up are easily killed when they luckily appear in front of the getaway car.
Both movies are about young travelers getting into horrifying situations, however in "Wolf Creek" the characters actually act like normal human beings therefore you feel disgusted when they get tortured and killed.
This is an American movie, about torturing people, made at a time when America, right or wrong, is receiving flak for torturing prisoners in Iraq and elsewhere, and makes no mention of the current world situation.
I'd been having a good day when myself and a couple of friends sat down to watch one of the 2 shiny new movies I'd bought.
However, the casting manager must take the blame when there are so many good Indian actors hopelessly underutilized in the film.
I have read many of the other reviews and have to agree that this is not one of David Leans best and the Academy must have either been drunk or high when they made their Oscar nominations.
Back when I was in college, instead of going to parties or trying to be "popular", my roommate and I watched a lot of movies.
It's probably because that is what struck me from the very beginning, particularly when there is so much going on in the opening sequence.
I truly can't remember why I decided to watch this one; probably because it got regular attention when it first came out.
Bones is quite good when he's perving up the girl.
Okay, i was at my local video store to rent some movies when I came across a tape.
It pales when compared with the Spencer Tracy version.
Having Hemingway in this story was an interesting idea, but all of the scenes with him are either parts from the book modified to have him in it, without really changing them, or really boring, which just makes it longer and makes it take more time to get to the interesting part, when he catches the marlin.
It was also really fake looking, when he saw the giant marlin, it didn't look all that big, and also, it was just a movie on a green screen and it looked like the fishing line went through the marlin at one time.
Things get shady when crooked real estate developers 'hoodwink' poor honest cattle ranchers.
Gene and his sidekick Frog Millhouse(Smiley Burnette)put the kibosh on the white-wash, when word circulates that gold has been found.
What was unbelievable to me is when Meg Ryan leaves the house while newly human Nicholas Cage is in the shower just to get a peach or pear or whatever fruit it was.
I just can't imagine that she would be apart from him for even a few minutes when they are finally together.
That and he watches her when she can't see him, too, which is just a shade too close to angelic stalking for comfort.
The only time, in fact, when he doesn't whisper is when he's ecstatic that he's bleeding.
And I almost burst out laughing when Seth said "red... COLOR" after he became human even though the whole film was shot in color and nothing hinted that he couldn't see colors.
No spoiler here: remember when Cage and his angelical companion Cassiel, standing on a skyscraper, mention the beauty of the view -which we are carried to see; and there, all over the screen, stands this awfully big Marlboro ad.
I cannot understand what would possess anyone to commit such an atrocity, and I cannot recommend that anyone waste their time on this piece of trash when they could instead be watching the original, "Wings of Desire" (1987), and its sequel.
She looked like her neck was snapping back, especially when she was jumping for Mme.
And I will agree with auwhite that it was indeed very disturbing when, let's just say, certain aspects of her wardrobe were missing, and that part of her body was sticking right out in front of the camera.
On the one hand, I'm happy when I read a review, where the user states, he wants to visit Greece after watching the movie.
With a reuniting of semi-regular star Denzel Washington, DÃ©jÃ  Vu proves that when Bruckheimer is paired with a like mind, his usual drivel can become great.
I only gave it a 3 because Slaters performance was good enough,but i'm sorry to all Wes Bentley fans,as i get angry when people slag Slater,but this guy really can't act,the last 10 minutes of the film,he gets a pass from me,but up until then,he is like a lump of wood,again,i apologise for being negative about him,but in this movie,he deserves it.
This movie dragged on building up its climax only fizzel out just when things looked good.
I believe you should suspend disbelief to a point when watching a movie, but the movie makers also have a responsibility to keep things within the realm of possibility.
I am a professional firefighter so I understand that in a crisis a lot of people do stupid things and use bad tactics when facing life threatening challenges.
I was floored when I saw it back in the day, and I could not understand why it did not receive the recognition it deserved, but now I think I understand the undercurrent which it churned within the industry was not good.
Then when you get to the half, even if you were trying to still believe its contrivances, the storyline becomes so incredibly stupid and fragmented you start thinking you must have dozed off at some point and missed something.
This is cemented when the campfire Jason story is interrupted thus a newcomer still wouldn't know anything about the origins of Jason.
How was that any better than when he found the mask in Part 3?
Since when did Friday the 13th turn into porn?
During these scenes it appears as if Jason is watching from behind a tree or something and masturbating, when it stops he recalls oh i'm here to kill 'em.
Killings are exaggerated, he/she would be dead when machete pierces their bodies in the first place.
I have come to realize that when Michael Bay says he is producing something, what he really means is that he is projectile-vomiting it.
I understand having a roundabout cast for appeal purposes (or more realistically PC purposes), but when you have the only African American character calling out his very existence in the movie, it is sad.
Though I was less than thrilled when they announced they were remaking one of my favourite franchises from the 80s, a little part of me wanted to see how they will remake this.
I'm not looking for social commentary when I see a slasher film, but all of the references to marijuana seem like they're being made by people who have never even come in contact with it.
It's almost like when you're in High School, bragging about how high you got, and the guy you're talking to lies so that he doesn't feel stupid for not partaking in substances like that: "Man, I got SOOOOoooo freaking high last night.
This is not a compliment: just before his "untimely" demise, he talks to a mannequin, and asks the mannequin if she "remembers that night, when (she) took (his) virginity".
I noticed this early on, but at one point later in the film, as a flashlight goes across the screen, there is actually a sound effect applied when the lens flare hits the audience.
Instead, I'll just mention the two most memorable non-spoilers:  1) There is gratuitous use of sudden loud noises to create shock or suspense when none would otherwise exist.
Lots of movies do this when they can't be scary - I can't think of another one that does it so often or so loudly.
It was a badge of honor to be mugged in Times Square back then, when you'd have to beg for a token (!)
from the Times Square Police Station (now an Army recruiting outpost) when your wallet got lifted in the balcony during a Bruce Lee triple-feature.
Everything is rather dull when Jason isn't slashing and gashing his victims.
We only get one "Kill, kill, kill, Ma, ma, ma" when he finds the hockey mask.
Absurd was the plot point of Jason holding the girl hostage (for reasons that were never truly made clear)-- since when has Jason EVER done anything like that?
when they were confronted with Jason.
And if Jason was playing possum the entire time, why didn't he just kill them when he still had access to a wood chipper and a barn full of tools?
Why did they bother doing makeup for Jason when they show his face for maybe two frames of the whole movie?
I was actually glad when some of the characters die.
Hey, Almodovar, Amenabar and friends - where were you when the decision to make the film was set????
Perhaps most offensive of all in this film is the performance of Kate Beckinsale, who looks like she is about ten years old, and the director is always making her take her clothes off so he can have another look at her breasts, and when they are covered up, the tight little garment over them keeps them well in view because the director is apparently obsessed with her and her sexuality.
The arrogant vanity of all of these people, who clearly believe themselves to be the most beautiful creatures on earth when they are in fact extremely ugly (except for Beckinsale who qualifies as cute but disturbingly vain and rampant), is nauseating in the extreme.
Well, there is no point in going on, because who cares, when a film is so terrible, what the original story was.
I feel a lot like the old crank in the episode when I say that the sight of a lot of oldsters running about pretending to be children is pretty embarrassing.
My issue is when he (or she) targets episodes that I think are pretty good.
I'm not kidding when I say this is a stinker.
It's a fascinating glimpse into Japanese culture in 1987, when the picture was made.
But when it isn't, you get "The Curse Of King Tut" (DVD titled "The Curse Of King Tut's Tomb"), a meandering wonderland of nonsensical cuts, bad dialog, magical explosives that cut 90-degree angles straight down and characters who add nothing, and I repeat, NOTHING, to the development of the plot.
At three hours it was a too long for me, but I remember watching Tarzan movies for hours on Saturday mornings when I was his age, including those awful Mike Henry in South America Tarzan movies.
The only reason I can fathom for hanging on to this DVD is to use as a coaster when you get unexpected company.
Almost all of the acting is completely covered up by the continuing narration until later in the movie, when the actors finally have time to present their characters without someone telling us what to think of them.
I don't know if that's true or not, but I know that when I watch a movie that's supposed to be about a heroine fighting for god and country, I expect to see her fight.
To make this approach credible, Besson introduces the murder and subsequent rape of Joan's elder sister, which she witnesses when she is 10 years old through cracks in the door to the closest where she is hiding.
Joan was close to her parents, and left them, sadly, when she went to Vaucoleurs (sic).
Thirdly, you know a movie is bad when it has to resort to creating jokes out of farting, urinating, and hurling swear words in a different dialect.
You know it was a bad movie when the only thing you hear coming out of the theater was a young kid citing the swear words that were repeatedly used by one of the leads.
Thou it's started like a comedy and social criticize of the famous Singaporean 'No U-turn', Jack Neo's movie turn, itself, quickly in a poor copy of Black Edwards' comedies when Fann Wong and Gurmit Singh exchange their souls to find themselves in each others body.
As I watched The Survivors, I couldn't help but wonder what was going through the mind of director Michael Ritchie when he was presented with the script.
There had to be a mission or a reason in Ritchie's mind when he decided that Robin Williams, a fast-talking comedian that can sometimes be uncontrollable, and Walter Matthau, a slow-methodical comedian that appeals to the "every man", would be his key players.
"That," I thought of the movie when it was over, "after setting aside all the comic exaggeration, is the real Japan."
These two appear to be starring in different movies even when they are on screen together.
Perhaps a satirical look at the difficulties of big business which is suggested in a funny opening scene when Williams is fired by his boss' parrot.
Not hopeless, necessarily, but it is melodramatic and theatrical when it should be subdued and forceful.
Case in point: the two main villains are silly when they should be chilling.
It is especially bad when anyone has to act as though experiencing extreme emotion, as during Richard's ordeal.
The fight direction is also amateurish, as when Hunter fights the Black Friar.
one involving a second London under London utilizing the underground tunnels, could work impeccably, but not when it is weighted down with boring light filters, ugly art design, grating actors, uninspired direction, appalling dialogue, and bad production.
On the surface it seems the message of this film is that when you reverse the roles 'gay people are just like straight people', which would be perfectly fine if: a) it were true that all people are alike b) society was progressive enough to have reached such idealistic levels Equally objectionable is Yiannis' 'seduction' of Sofia.
Is prejudice OK when the oppressed become the oppressors?
Actually, what would the film do without you, because they always seem to make you the talking point when they get the chance.
You could see that lizard had enough of his singing when he decides to disrupt the dance, where Chase is having a good time spreading his talent and making some time to dance with his gal.
After an hour, when the film is almost over, the Sheriff is asked: 'Have you heard the stories about a giant lizard?'
It's like going to a hip hop show in Toronto, and it's a pleasure when the gila monster busts through the wall mid-number.
While the film could hardly hold a candle in comparison to even the average A-list release of the time, when considered in comparison to the similar monster sci-fi films of the era, the quality invested is unexpectedly exceptional for the genre.
Even the depiction of 1950s teen culture is hardly as cringe-worthy as it could be, far from taking the condemnatory stance of many of its contemporaries (crucially, it is a teen who finally saves the day) and even the inherent racism in the genre is challenged, by having the sole non-American (the teenaged protagonist's French girlfriend) act as the proverbial voice of reason, the only one feeling uneasy when the Gila Monster lurks nearby.
Fred Graham is also a sturdy presence as the honest sheriff daring to look beyond the conventional answers when examining the disappearance of missing teenagers, and Lisa Simone laudably resists melodramatics as Sullivan's girlfriend, managing the two rarities of providing an intelligent female lead, and not spending the entire picture screaming.
Lowest point of the film is when one of the town's leading idiots tries to sing a stupid song while pathetically twanging a ukulele, first for a crippled little girl, then for a group of moronic teenagers.
One is called "And the Lord Said Laugh, Children, Laugh", which consists mostly of that particular phrase repeated for three solid minutes, and the other one has lines like "my baby rocks me when she rocks and rolls me when she rolls", whatever the hell that means.
I couldn't help noticing those facts when I watched this movie.
As the film progresses, the creature seems to grow in stature, as when he's sized up against oncoming vehicles or when he manages to destroy a railroad trestle causing a train wreck.
He was subsequently killed when he "fell" from a hotel balcony, an apparent but suspicious suicide that was treated by the police as a possible homicide.
In the film, when this conversation starts, one is left wondering, "What?"
One part near the end illustrates the problem with the story as filmed: In the book, when Gutman claims a thousand dollar bill is missing, Spade makes Brigid get naked in the bathroom as he inspects her and her clothes to see if she took it.
It was interesting to discover how much the Japanese were taxed (at least when this movie was made) and what lengths they will go to cheat on their taxes!
Just as when Action/Adventure films cover up a weak story with expensive CGI or Hi-Tech action sequences; this fiasco does the same with eloquent dialogue and the grace and beauty of the 'period' part of the story.
You really have to see how they jump to conclusions and somehow come up with these clues pretty much when they snap their fingers.
"A young man with a passion for hot rods and pretty girls finds himself in trouble when he gets mixed-up with some criminals.
Randy's most heroic struggle though is with his wealthy father(Charles Shaughnessy), when he falls in love with Hallie(Stacey Dash).
Hilariously, Kathleen finds time to serve everyone drinks from a  tray before getting beheaded by a sickle when told to go check a  window.
I personally would have enjoyed him kicking Cabos' ass when he encounters him in the bedroom, instead of beating his poor friend up.
Dinner guests for a professor/archaeologist find out they're on the menu instead when the undead, from a crypt unearthed by their host, come a calling.
There are scenes of gut-munching and neck ripping for the fans who desire this sort of thing when they watch their zombie movies.
'Burial Ground' is one of those movies we horror buffs used to pass by when going through the horror section at the video store.
I stumbled upon this movie when a friend was going to throw out an electric guitar of his and decided to give it to me.
And the obvious flaws, like the doctor saying he was going to do an epidural when she was obviously way past the time when one is possible.
What The Waitress does is take a case, where dumping the jerk IS more than appropriate, and causes lingering anticipatory angst in a woman's mind, seeing similar things in the men she lives around, stretching now to find them, when, in fact, those things looked for so hard are not even close to really being part of what the men around those women will do or are being, in degree nor goal, even being capable of mimicking.
Women and men, both, tend to blame the wrong person, the easy one to blame, the man, in this movie, when it is many times their own sadness they cannot deal with.
as she said many times, will be too often a result for many women after seeing that movie, when that is the stupidest thing they could do, not warranted and not beneficial, thinking life is better without men altogether.
However, there are two person I enjoyed somehow: Old Joe (Andy Griffith) and Shelly herself (as "Dawn", especially when she confessed about her new boyfriend).
They could have gone deeper into the relationship between Bob and Walt, but they barely go into that, and when they do, it isn't funny (except for the `We're Off to See the Wizard' thing).
Being the movie geek that I am, I eat up anything related to Hollywood, so I was excited for when Bob and Walt were going there, hoping to hear some good Hollywood jokes.
I think the only six shots in the entire movie were shot-counter shots, even when both characters were the conjoined twins.
I looked away to see if when I looked back, I could imagine what the screen would look like in my mind, purely based upon the sound.
Even if you like this movie, you have to admit that there are plenty of talented writers and directors out there that could make a better movie, but I guess the American audience is too dumb to know talent when they see it and instead liked this movie.
In my opinion, the actors are good, anyway, this kind of movies are good for distraction, laughing, and when you want to have a very good time and want to forget your own problems.
The writer Ray Bradbury, saw this catastrophe coming, even he was embarrassed when "Martian Chronicles" was released.
even without commercials (on the DVD of course) you'll feel as if half your life is over when it's through.
but you should have some fun watching it because as corny and horrible as THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES is, there is a feeling you will have, like when you're home sick: that at least you get to miss work or school.
However, when the movie focused on it's anti-Bush slant, it made me wonder if they were really being accurate.
I think most politicians are a waste of our taxpayer money so I'm not partial to either party but I hate feeling like I'm subject to someone's political agenda when I watch a documentary.
I found no value in portraying the Bush's as Kay-lovers when Democrats received just as much Enron campaign money as Republicans did.
first of all, since when is it okay to have sex with adopted family?
Meanwhile on the Island itself the three survivors, the pilot (Jimy Hefner), a real estate guy named Deutsch (Richard Fancy) & a pretty young girl named Kelsey Cunningham (Kimberlee Peterson) whose Father is interested in buying the Island, are deciding what to do when a group of vicious genetically altered Baboons kill the pilot.
Ron Perlman has the lead; a broken man unable to have a life because he stayed alive when many others did not.
Well, the director, master craftsman Robert Anderson, who also has credits The Young Graduates and The Hoax (not the Richard Gere one, remember that for the exam), movies no one but his wife has probably seen, and so with Cindy and Donna, his first film, he puts everything he knows into his art... which means, basically, we get a scene like when Donna is totally 'doing it' with her pot dealer in the car at night, and Cindy is looking on but, you know, the angle of the car is so radical so that there's no way Cindy is looking in on the car that the angle of the camera is and... Maybe I'm getting ahead of myself, this is, after all, Grade-X trash that has basically no value; a Cinemax late-night flick probably has better production value, and maybe slightly worse music than the repetitive garage rock here.
The material is spartan when it comes to plot development and really is just one sleazy scenario after another.
Where was a gun in the hands of a decent shot when it should have been in other scenes?
The movie takes a little too long to get to the new mutations, so none of the thrills really begin until then, but the action is exciting when it's there, most particularly in the final half-hour.
Speaking of the mutations, it's basically a medium-sized creature with legs and a huge appetite, but lacks when it comes to eyesight and sound.
Suddenly all his sex addiction problem ends when he finds the girl of his dreams (that's like for the fourth or fifth time).
Unfortunately i have watched it, it ruined one of my evenings and the only thing that this movie showed me, once again in my life, is that when you don't know what you want you ruin your life and the life of others around you :)
What was he doing surfing those websites when he found out, anyway, who is he to judge?
My reaction to Caveh was mostly disgust with his self-absorption, ranging to being absolutely CREEPED OUT when he groped receptionists' breasts at massage parlors.
Just when I thought the "Eeewwww" factor couldn't get worse, I listened to him reminisce how much he enjoyed himself by groping and getting thrown out, how it was a big entertaining game for him.
I finally caught on when, with the third girl, he freelances all night, then comes home to Christa and kisses her and says he wants to try to kick the habit.
It gets boring when you see he's going nowhere and he succeeds again in alienating yet another woman who started out being understanding.
"Matando Cabos" is the title of Alejandro Lozano's debut film, that even when it shares some similitude with American Films, such as "Pulp Fiction" and "Taxi Driver", it stands as a great movie, bringing a refreshing breathe to Mexican commercial cinema.
The story is about two best friends, Jaque and Mudo, that are involved on a critical situation when they accidentally kidnap their boss, the sadistic and rich Oscar Cabos, and they hide him on Jaque's car.
We argued when you were young but now I love you."
And yes, you argued when you were young but it wasn't that bad."
But in this third "Aladdin" movie, the two are about to wed (in their plain, white wedding digs) when suddenly, Aladdin's random father, (who never even existed up until this point) along with his forty thieves, crashes and destroys the ceremony.
Yet, when the bad thief Sa'Luk touches the Hand and turns to gold, he can no longer move at all.
By 'they' I mean the people who told the young lady at the video store when I asked her "Do you know anything about this?"
i always feel a little guilty when i do it though.
I know a movie's in trouble when I can sit there watching it and say to my partner, "So, when do the lights go out?"
Or when Patsy Kensit goes to use the phone and I say, "The phone is out," and Patsy comes back and says, "The phone's dead."
if you want to see softcore lesbian porn with Ally Sheedy (not BreakfastClub!Ally Sheedy, when she was kinda cute in a weird way, but AgingAndReallyCreepilyOver-Aerobicised!
The only good parts to the movie was when Grandma got nervous anytime Ghost got near her.
The credits tell us it's based on a screen play from Paul Corvino; it makes us wonder if the writer must have been under influence when he conceived this pathetic thriller.
Between the 3-4 rounds of sex they have (when they are "regenerating") they start to chat discovering each other and finally they get friends.
Is it about how sincere (Callas) was when she refused to complete the hoax and demanded to terminate the movie within the movie ?
I didn't hate it because it's not understandable...I hate it because it doesn't want to be understandable, and I've always thought that when you finish watching a movie then give it a lot of thinking to discover totally nothing about its own meaning or its special message, so this is the definition of a "Bad" movie !
One can not be but startled by the incredibly high reputation that Zeffirelli has in some quarters, where he is revered as an artist, an author, Visconti's heir, a consummate aesthete ,when the guy is so obviously much more banal--a buffoon, a hack, a charlatan, a bluffer, a hustler, a swindler.
This was a fun film to see on TV reruns in the early 1980s, and to see it now would be fun simply to remind me of when I was a kid.
In 1978, when this movie was shot, I lived in East Lyme, CT and I was an extra for this movie (the big crowd at the railroad crossing, waiting for the train to come - I was paid $35, a fortune to a 14 year old in 1978).
I watched the movie when it came out (and again when it ran in reruns about a year later) and from what I remember it was typical shlocky '70s action-adventure stuff -- actors trying to either start a career or resurrect one, a suspenseful moment every fifteen minutes or so to allow the director to fade to black and go to commercial, horrid disco-inflected "Charlie's Angels"-ish soundtrack, etc.
And now, when my kids are a little older, I can tell them their dad was in a TV movie with William Shatner, and they can say "A what with who?"
Nevertheless, when confronted by other supposed adolescent boys (they all appeared about 25), he can't even figure out when it's in his best interest to keep his mouth shut.
(Why language gets recast in TV dubbing is beyond me when sitcoms now include some of the raunchiest allusions imaginable.
As for the child molestation business, and the claims of ripoff -- both irrelevant when this banal, derivative film sinks itself in its own morass of cliches.
He is waiting around for a mail order bride from Scandinavia, and when she arrives he mistreats her.
I do understand when it was made and what was happening to the world.
Mimi Rogers basically plays the same character Helen Hunt played in "Twister"; someone who experienced a family death during a tornado when she was younger.
I am a fan of pink panther films and when I finished the movie I was left crying and not they way the movie wants you to.
The film follows the story of when the famed diamond 'The Pink Panther' is stolen once again.
Things start to go wrong when the Sellers footage runs out, at the moment Closeau's voice is dubbed in with the worst imitation imaginable.
I think this film is awful it was done when Peter Sellers already was dead.Maybe there are funny clips when Peter Sellers are in but I still donÂ´t think that this film are a little bit funny.
(More Likely) Bottom-Line: Maybe it's just me, but when a world-renowned physical comedy actor passes away it is insulting to clip together a film intern creating a mockery of what Sellers believed so hole-hardily in - an original honest laugh.
I should have stopped the tape when Somebody takes the Pink Panther without even tripping one alarm.
The closest anybody comes to trying to solve the mystery is the scene when the reporter is threatened by the mob boss.
This movie's comedy leans heavily on Dreyfus' new relapse, a subplot that was getting tired ever since they disintegrated him in "Strikes Back" Just when it seems that the movie is going to start moving again, it does.
Blake Edwards on the other hand showed no such scruples when it came to the star of his Pink Panther franchise, Peter Sellers.
Second, he wanted people to know who was behind the Panther franchise, a point made at the very start of the film when the name "Blake Edwards" fills the screen, before becoming "Blake Entertainment Edwards."
Some dead actors have managed to reappear after they died in films, like Jean Harlow in SARATOGA, but usually they were shooting the film when they got sick and died.
The sequences with Sellers at work had his energy, but the gaps appeared when Lumley or rest of the cast struggled with the vapid plot.
She is quite good too, but her role is confused by the script (her best sequence is not with Loggia - a sad lost opportunity by two good performers - but just before when she realizes her taxi driver is being forced to kidnap her).
If they had done it (presumably if the performers were available or when they were) more time might have been spent on the script.
However, when there are no more outtakes, or even scenes to steal, from the other films, the movie fades quickly as the entire story shifts to a memoir of Clouseau's life.
Even when it attempts to be funny on its own, Edwards resorts to stealing these gags (as opposed to the footage) from earlier triumphs.
and when he does speak (cursing the "swine seagull") it's clearly Little's voice doing a bad Sellers impression.
Don Wilson stars as a cop who enjoys the occasional virtual reality fighting game, however things go wrong when the people behind the game decide to take virtual reality to a new level by making real people from the video game, okay actually they make the cybersex models as prototype but the main bad guy from the video game awakens and starts killing people and now the only man who can beat the guy is Don Wilson, who in the mean time falls in love with the cybersex model.
The only time i laughed was when Dante kept saying in funny voice, "Nobody can beat Dante, Muhwa hwaa."
OR they needed to just let him use his real voice (and move his mouth), and maybe give him a costume that would not make him stick out like a sore thumb when walking down the street.
You'll know it when you see it.
All I could ask myself when watching this movie was "when is it gonna go off!"
I say this because I told my brother the whole plot ending at the first commercial break when we were watching the original 1966 broadcast as pre-teens.
Reasonable viewers will make allowances for cultural differences when it comes to how bossy in-laws are tolerated.
Reasonable viewers will make allowances for cultural differences when it comes to what extent the bossy in-laws are tolerated.
Thoughts wander about easily when the mind is unable to embrace the story.
I'm not sure what it is but there seems to be some curse when it comes to films about the elusive Bigfoot.
Lance Henriksen plays a billionaire who leads an expedition into the pacific northwest in hopes of finding his daughter as she was on board a small plane when it crashed in the mountains.
I can not remember when i watched a movie about the "abe" and got touched, or even scared.
And you know your watching a bad "B" movie when in the middle of the pacific northwest a hot chick decides to go to the nearest hot spring and bathe!
********SPOILER ALERT********  And the Sasquatch himself is not bad when you don't really see him and he's just a blurry image behind some trees or bushes but when you finally see him at the end your of course disappointed.
To summarize how bad this movie is, its best scene is when Marla Lawson, the character of Andrea Roth, is wounded, and the guide of the expedition says that she needs to have an injection of tetanus vaccine.
The sasquatch is unseen, but sees the mountain climbers' body heat (like the alien in "Predator"), and I did wonder when it was going to strike.
And when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, though nothing great.
But there is a seen I personally enjoyed: which is when the blonde goes to take a bath in a pit of boiling water with a man watching and for about 10 seconds you see her whole body with no towel on!
That was the best scene in the whole film because you see sasquatch starring at them but the last 10 minutes is when we see his whole body.
I remember when we got the first photos back from the set we were all talking about how much of a shame it was that this creature was in a movie that would probably be pretty poor.
Do you like it when the screen fades to black during a TVM ?
The movie starts out in typical film noir when a research team crash lands somewhere in the Cascades via airplane.
It was a late night when I poped this into my DVD player.
You know a movie is going to be bad when its sole star power is Lance Henriksen.
For some reason, he left a scene about cave art in the film when it either needs more exposition to justify getting there, or it needs to just be cut out, because it's not that important (the monster's intelligence and "humanity" could have easily been shown in another way).
Yes and no, because they were all unknowns when this was made.
Just remember the painful scenes when Hugh Grant tried to speak American/Brooklyn/Italian slang.
Or when Jeanne Tripplehorn laughed about the way Hugh Grant runs.
When an actor is only able to do one kind of character, who cares when it is done well?
and what can you do or say (except fall in love with it on the spot and say "I love you," respectively associated, right there in the orchard of neon horror that is the movie rental place)--and then so imagine your heartbreak when you get home, undress it from its plastic case and discover to yourself the fact that it is completely: affectless, toneless, actionless, heartless, penniless, paceless, plotless, heartless, and, perhaps most horribly, humorless--you and your best bud cannot, for the glory that the world holds, come up with a single joke to combat the ceaseless waves of offense to your senses and sensibilities that this offers--not to mention devoid of a) evil and b)seeds of said evil...there are no effects: it features untold minutes of floral footage, which cause the actors to expire at completely surreal and random moments--with which occasional happening you can utterly sympathize...I went looking for a movie too bad to be believed, and I found it.
VIOLENCE: $$ (Houghton hacks Rita Gam's hand with a gardening blade when Rita is engulfed in vines.
The fundamentals that make up this movie's meager `plot' are recognizably familiar: The Avarian bank heist, the bickering gangsters, the Yakuza double-cross, the James Whalian ersatz-Frankenstein who crosses a line man was not meant to cross in order to reanimate his beloved dead wife, the Bay-esque macho military men with their Sam Elliot moustaches and Manuel Noriega-like skin, as well as the hilarity and wackiness that ensues when these forces clash.
it didn't start out to bad at the beginning since there were yakuzas acting sort of funny but then it went downhill from when the main characters went into the factory.
You really can't go into any post-Hellbound sequel expecting anything resembling a good film, and that is truer than ever when it comes to the ones directed by Rick Bota.
When the film finally reveals itself in the final ten minutes, the short sequences that put everything together are miles better than the rest of the film, and it makes me wonder why the writers decided to make the film work from the standard hallucination filled plot when there's was a far darker, much more interesting and, most of all, far more relevant to the series, story waiting in the wings.
It is OBVIOUS that the writer and director of this movie had only seen Inferno when they made this garbage.
(Also, the back of the box says she is trying to stop Pinhead, when she actually is very civil with him, in one whopping flashback.
The only wonderful moments were when Maggie Cheung onto screen.
The great part of the film is when Maggie works in a Chinese restaurant and quits and she speaks something spontaneous in Cantonese, which was very authentic.
It's somewhat tender and ironic, too, when you notice that, in the end, they're trying to seduce each other in a very childish and innocent way when they have already spent three condoms and about half an hour doin' it.
I've always been her fan, so perhaps I'm a bit biased when saying this, but you're completely captivated by her character.
it is a tired excuse for film making when directors, writers, actors and actresses come together and make a 'harrowing', 'powerful', 'grim' movie about drugs, sex and whatever else they care to throw at the screen.
Further, he has a large selection of different hats that he self-consciously picks from every time he has to go and perform some task; when he has to delegate an arrest to his sergeant, he even delegates the appropriate (fishing) hat to him also!
(If the movie informed us that Flor was undocumented, I must've missed it when I went to the kitchen to get some coffee, and I'll stand corrected if that's the case.)
His professional life seems to be modeled after master chef Thomas Keller, who was exalted in the same way by food critics when he opened his "French Laundry" restaurant in Yountville (which is indeed fantastic).
This is a man who doesn't make films often, his fame being grounded mostly on his TV shows, so when he does, one tends to believe it's because he really has something to say.
I just managed to bear the movie as it got worse and worse and was thankful when it ended, which is when I realized that it didn't just feel long to me; it's also that the thing is way too long!
The voice performances of the actors who lead them were astonishing when the main thing to pay attention to is to your ear (very clever).
His enemies in Spain never relented and Columbus was charged with thievery and ineptness and was brought back in shackles in a scene similar to Charlton Heston's Moses coming in to the kingdom in shackles when it was discovered that he was the deliverer.
What do you get when you mix a big star like Gibson with a sappy script and a mediocre director like Steve Minor: A sappy and contrived film.
I remember when children's stories had a logical progression of the story line.
-- G.K. Chesterton, _The Man Who Was Thursday_, Chapter II  See also:  Chesterton fans will probably remember when Chesterton's priest-detective, Father Brown, first interacts with the great criminal Flambeau, who was disguised as a priest.
I bought into the hype and watched Moral Orel when it first premiered.
The dialog was made of one clichÃ© after another suitably punctuated for effect such as when Walters (Luana Walters that is, here credited as Susan) announces to her husband Dixie Logan "Even if you were framed I know now that you're ROTten" (emphasis on ROT).
At least it announced when something of interest was about to happen.
The highlight was when he was in the nightclub with Luana Walters, and the angle of the shot had a table light covering the bottom part of his face.
That might make it a lot of fun for some people, but I was hoping for a clearer line that actually mattered when it got twisted.
In fact I go a shock when I check the clock and found that I had only been subjected to it for 1:30mins... it felt much longer.
No one really seems to "care" about anything even when they're shot or shooting at someone.
I love a lot of foreign cinema; I have a real soft spot for coming-of-age movies; I enjoy slower paced storytelling; and I'm happy to spend time with interesting characters even when there's not a lot happening in a film.
Many other scenes are marred by being a little *too* over-the-top (as when a prisoner slobbers all over the naked bosom of a prostitute pressed up against the window to his cell).
I hate to break this to all the Dwight fans out there, but when it comes to film making, the emporer has no clothes.
Usually I hate it when someone talks during a movie.
In my opinion, when people go to the movies, they want to enjoy themselves.
The happy moments of this film, like when Val kisses Bridget Fonda on the balloon, or when he is making love in his office are just great.
The westerns of the fifties had a certain cheerfulness in them, even when the story was sad, and that is what is lacking in this film.
The script of the film is potentially interesting... and I bet that's what the impressive members of this film's cast thought when they signed up for this project.
The real confoundment came to me when leaving the theater (To this date, I have never walked out on a movie for better or worse) and my friends totally loved it.
I wanted to love it, but in the long run didn't care when the credits rolled...
I mentioned the taxidermist, one who preserves the dead in a life-like state, and the other passengers are those who can be seen as people who are chartered with protecting and/or killing other people, but when it comes to a single person, that is more trying.
First,some of the lighting during the night scenes weren't good.I had to turn the brightness up on my TV during the night scenes.Second,some of the scenes kinda linger on and you just wait for something happen and when it does you think "Finally!"
of the different animals was extremely annoying and irritating, as was the kids when they would be loudly singing off-key.
Johnny Depp plays a detective with clairvoyant powers, and you might think those powers would come in handy when looking for Jack the Ripper, but you'd be wrong.
Heather Graham (who's accent also slips out - when it should be her tits)is gratingly out of place as a prostitute her colleagues all look like hags while she looks like a model.
but i wanted to talk a little about 'Ghost', played by 'young' Tatiana Maslany, i have written young in lines because when i watched the movie i thought, about 11 up to 14, not older, no way, but she was 19 at the time, unbelievable!!!
Reading the other reviews on IMDB Andrew Johnson hits the nail on the head when he says there is no emotional involvement with any of the characters, especially the Unfortunates (whores), and it is this dis-attachment that finally kills ÂFrom Hell' off.
Usually when things are this dire you can laugh about it but not in this case.
Yet things somehow do when their friend Ann is kidnapped and they are drawn into a conspiracy with links higher up than they could possibly imagine.
Abberline becomes deeply involved with the case, which takes on personal meaning to him when he and Mary begin to fall in love.
As a great fan of Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's original graphic novel and an admirer of the Hughes Brothers, I had rather high hopes for "From Hell" when first I heard of its production.
In one scene, Scott's brother is sitting in his wagon and shot three separate times when being cross-examined by the Baddie (Richard Boone).
Then, when Scott chases down the runaway wagon, you can CLEARLY see the stuntman moving about--crouched down in the buckboard.
But then, only a second later when Scott stops the wagon, the guy is splayed out--dead as a doornail!!
There are also fight scenes where it's obvious that the people are NOT the actors--especially when a dark haired guy is standing in for silver haired Scott!!
It perfectly shows "What one should avoid" when writing a script and directing a movie.
And when a cast list contains Randolph Scott, Richard Boone, Lee Van Cleef, Skip Homeier and Dennis Weaver-that's a crime as much as it is a shame.
You know you're in trouble when the title of the movie makes no sense.
Yet, when Boone says Scott has no witnesses, Scott doesn't challenge him.
The point I'm trying to get across is simply this: I'm thankful that no one had to endure this treatment in high school... especially when it's portrayed so poorly!
(I liked the part when she tells the Indian at the newsstand not to talk to her because she is of a higher caste.
Generally when an inconclusive ending is presented it is because the producers are leaving you something to play with or leaving room for a sequel.
It is not the sort of bad of the Pearl Harbor breed of terribleness however, where one is left spinning in an ocean of the terrible wondering when the sheer horror will end.
It is a special thing when two children and their talking dog buddy need to chase down someone, so the dog somehow transports itself into the driver's seat from where it declares, apparently without irony, "Get in!
This joke reaches a crescendo when a whole bunch of carts, all chained together, get nudged and end up rolling downhill, all passing over his foot one after another.
How about the opening scene, when the overweight boy is on the ferry, finds a pet rat on the floor which everybody sees and as a direct result causes all of the passengers to puke over the side?
Or when the kids are trying to sneak past the moronic inventor, the girl has a fantastic idea of disguising his son as a female.. by slipping a two piece swimming costume on him (while neglecting to do anything about his appearance).
On the technical side, I suppose I should mention the safety threads that stand out like a sore thumb when Sherlock is dragging the kid along the ground, and the three most obvious dummies ever which are supposed to be the bad guys as they're clinging on for dear life to a speeding ship.
But all these pale in comparison to seeing the dog actually talk, as the mouth movements hardly match the words and sometimes you hear it speak when its jaws are firmly closed.
What someone with half a brain who has read any SF will be asking themselves for most of the running time is, since these time travellers from the future have nifty stun guns able to gently render anyone unconscious at a touch of a button why, when presented with a situation where they have to prevent someone from being in a particular place at a particular time, don't they just stun the poor sod till it's safe for them for him to wake up?
when there are dozens of films like this crying out to be remade - and, with just a bit of care, got right.
I was very disappointed with the movie when I first saw it (but not as much as now) as there are few movies that come from true sci-fi writers (Hugo winners and the like) and I was really looking forward to it.
The movie captured me when it started but when the first plane crashed, the movie crashed.
Naturally, potential disaster occurs, when a device used to stun passengers before their abduction is accidentally left on two separate flights, one in 1963, the other in 1989.
The final stupidity occurs when Robert Joy tells Ladd she will have Kristofferson's child, after she has made it clear she is sterile.
The final suspense chase, when finally the truck driver shows up, and one cannibal is ran over, then Leatherface chases the girl, and the long awaited ending is near.
I saw this movie Manny years ago when it come out, it whats a big CHOCK to me.
But when i realized that this was in fact the movie and that it really was this ugly i almost laughed until i started to cry.
I got really shocked when i saw that they called themselves experts and that they said something about how this movie should set the standards for the next coming 3d animated movies, NO WAY!
Regardless of how bad a movie is, when I write on of these user comments, I usually try to add a touch of humor or a joke here or there (how effective I am, I don't know).
I don't know when I've been less entertained by a movie.
I gave it 1 star because:   1) there wasn't anything lower available to give it here other than 0 stars, and it ain't getting off that easy, and   2) I did enjoy some of the music in the movie (when it wasn't trying to sound 'comical' when the twin vampires were doing whatever the heck it is they're doing while the cameras were rolling... it sure wasn't anything funny, that's for sure.)
The tearjerking that tugged though was uniquely caused by suppressed hilarity - when I wasn't yawning, that is.
(That's when they're not projecting an 'earthier' vibe as an act to try and get laid, of course...
I saw this on tape in the '90s instead of when it came out in the early '80s.
Maybe when I'm years older and further away from my own passage into adulthood, I will find this movie nostalgic and charming.
What was he thinking when he wrote this?
You know it's a bad western when all the actors are wearing new clothes like they just walked out of a western clothing store!
Craig Hawksley brings comic relief to the film when everyone is about to be massacred in the films final shoot 'em up scene.
Weep with relief when no one accepts Katie's offer to extend their stay even longer!
Unfortunately, when the dialog isn't smart, it's downright smarmy, completely off the mark.
& the 2nd reason i forgot to mention was the #1 reason i watched it off Cable was it's an Early film that "Roger The Man Corman" produced when he had NOT long before had quit directing films.
The problem with this concept arises when it is stated that the engines were acquired as scrap.
The main reason this seems so unfunny to many younger viewers is that a lot of the humor was topical, and topical humor becomes unfunny as soon as the topic is no longer "current events"--how funny will "Dubya" jokes seem by around 2084, when they'll be about as old as the jokes in "Boo!"?
", and the only reason I got most of the topical jokes is that I'm a big fan of 1930s movies thanks to having grown up when TV stations showed movies late at night instead of infomercials (yes, kids, they really used to do that!)
The only high points to the film are the presence of Robert Forster, who is still good even in dreck like this and gets a few good lines and one scene later in the movie when the banker deals with his blackmailer.
Also, when we got this movie it was listed as "Street Zombies", not "Ozone".
It's a fair indicator of a bad film when there's more than one title involved-- alas, we had no warning.
Anyone expecting something along the lines of the standout far east films such as the Ring, the Eye, the Grudge etc is in for a massive disappointment when viewing this effort.
The hitchhiker is unceremoniously booted out of the van when he goes bonkers, cutting one of the teens with a razor.
Whoops I forgot my 3D glasses to experience those mind-popping images (where we are informed when to put them on or take them off), but I doubt that gimmick would have saved this already below-average, if bizarre supernatural/slasher tale from Hong Kong.
It looks like it had a bit money behind it, but it feels second-rate when compared to others of its field and that ending is a complete wimp out.
Before I start this review, I must admit that when I saw this movie, it was the wee hours of the morning and I was slightly intoxicated.
So when the nincompoops at NBC decided they weren't going to give it a fair shot, it must have been a bitter pill to swallow.
So, when the series begins, Christine's spouse has already walked out on her, for a younger, NICER woman, who is also named Christine; hence, NEW Christine.
It is only at the end when Sally in placed into situations of intense danger do we feel any sympathy towards the protagonists.
The only time I laugh is when Matt is making fun of his ridiculous sister or someone else is saying how lame she truly is.
It may have worked in the 60's with an actress (Lucille Ball) in a class of her own, but in the year 2006 "The New Adventures of Old Christine" is a pretty scary concept when one considers that it made it onto the most influential media format (TV) around the world.
when I read about this movie it sounded like it might be a little gem like Orgazmo (by Trey Parker).
I expect to be offended when I see a Waters movie but the story has to be complete for any movie to be recommended by me and this one wasn't.
And although cinema has gone through a major evolution in the past 30 years, most nowadays thrillers don't come even close to TCM when it comes to atmosphere and "creepyness".
Really, I thought that I had seen it all when I saw movies like "Freddy Got Fingered", "The Nutty Professor 2" and all those teenage comedies full of toilet humor and humor about other bodily functions.
And how do you know when it is all getting too much for the normal, even liberal, thinking person?
Well, when you go to the cinema, find 2/3 of the seats empty and, before the movie is half, see more than half of the viewers leave the room before the movie has ended...  Talking about the story will not take very long, because there just isn't much of a story to be found in this movie.
But when Sylvia is hit on the head during an accident and suffers from a concussion, she all a sudden turns into a sex-addict herself.
I'm not sure why it bothers me so much in this movie when I can let it go in movies with similar racial incidents like any of the Tarzan movies, but it really bothered me here.
Our heroes looking at African animals from the air with binoculars, yet when we are shown the "binocular" view, it's taken from ground level.
Yet when the woman spoke the broken English, it was with a Mexican accent.
Then Pam begins to get suspicious when he doesn't return.
In agony and shock, she is forced to watch Leatherface dismember Kirk's corpse with a chainsaw, all at once aware that Kirk is dead and that she herself is certainly doomed, when just ten minutes beforehand, they were outside looking for a swimming hole.
The two protagonists get in the plane and fly away, and the woman makes dreamy comments about how when she gets back to civilization she immediately wants to buy a hat.
I think the fact that I saw this movie when I was about fourteen, at the height of my FPJ crush and still didn't like it, really says something.
Apparently the guy can act when given good material (He was in Kenneth Lonergan's 'This is our Youth' in the West End), but unfortunately none of his movies so far have been able to evidence that.
this is probably the question when the people wrote the script.
Where was the humor that usually happens when the sexes start talking?
Also, the preview/trailer for this movie, had Jason Biggs and the 4 chicks when they say "have you ever been with 4 women before?"
Mainly because when this low budget movie was originally released by its unscrupulous distributors it was dismissed as another trashy drive-in horror movie, when in fact few realized the brilliance to be found within it.
It's totally original with its brazen, full-throttled approach to horror when most films made in those days were static, slow and poky.
The "fans boys" that followed Jamie Lee's films were too young when TCM was released.
But the thing that always gives me the creeps when I watch TCM is the scene at the beginning, when they drive by the cattle ranch and we see the poor animals while Franklin talks about how they are killed and everything.
Their ordeal begins when they enter a sinister old house (don't they always?)
Even when the sensory chaos is broken for a while so that our genre expectations can be fulfilled as the crippled guy Franklin mutters to a couple that leaves the abandoned house to make out "Yeah, see you in an hour or so" (followed by a drone in the score) and we just know he's never gonna see them again, a typically ominous foreshadowing common in slashers, that only lasts for seconds.
Eisenstein must have been clairvoyant when he spoke of how powerful montage can be.
Even when Hooper overplays his hand (as in the dinner scene) it's all done with deliberation that cannot be ignored, like maybe the director is as insane as the characters he's depicting and he takes great pleasure in basking in their insanity.
Especially when the political angle was so clear.
Geez, Adam Sandler can be really funny, but when he bombs, he really bombs.
I'm not saying Leatherface spared him for last out of mercy(He had just met Franklyn when he kills him), but because they are similar symbolically.
Even more strange is that it's Franklyn who inadvertently causes their deaths when he gives them the faulty directions to the swimming hole, as if he's unknowingly getting his revenge.
adam sandler is probably my worst actor of all time, the only good film he's ever been in is air heads when he wasn't popular.
i don't hate this film because i was a young teen when this came out and did find it pretty funny but never thought it was good.
The storyline is implausible, the humor crass, satire entirely lost; I wonder what was Meyer thinking when he made the movie!
Ken Corday let go of an incredible amount of potential for amazing storytelling when he decided that "Jack" had to leave with "Jennifer".
I'm saddened to see that a show that I watched from 1965-1992 and then started watching again when Steve and Matt and Mary Beth returned is still going to be so terrible.
This is what happens when the writers run out of ideas and take to bizarre stories just to keep the show running.
Second, the movie is more than explicit when it comes to male nudity.
Even though the actors are believable in their personification of homosexuals, they are simply not convincing when it comes to human emotion.
This was not fresh , this was not original, and this in no way gave me confidence in my Defending Canadian Cinema argument I sometimes bring out when there's an awkward silence at parties.
The film might even flash forward to a committed, long-term relationship when the boys are older.
I think the British are very biased when it comes to their own films.
Toni Collette's face is still in my memory - her terrified-to-do-or-say-the-wrong-thing rabbit eyes, her rapture at feeling connected to her 3 fellow temp workers (and specifically, seeing her nose crinkle the way it does when she smiles), the desolation of seeing their bond destroyed by wretched but inevitable bone-chilling office politics and fear.
Another commentator is right on the button when he says that we the audience do not care who wins because both antagonists are childish.
Though they are the reason why some changes have been brought about in his actions; introspection leads to the development of wisdom on account of which he is able to continue fighting crime, even when he is incapacitated by old age.
I really don't like it when it's forced on someone.
batman/bruce wayne isn't cocky("I hate it when they put up a fight").
Batman (Christopher Stapleton) is in the midst of a massive clean-up of Gotham's underground drug circuit when an encounter with a thief (Trip Hope) leads Batman into the fight of his life The only good aspects of this film are that the direction is good, the film looks pretty good, and the basic underlying ideas are unique.
Unfortunately, these ideas are lost and muddled, because the film keeps switching teams; one minute it's about vigilantes being wrong, then the next minute they say the hero is needed; then the villain gets all of the sympathy, making you want to hate Batman, and then when it ends, they want you to sympathize with Batman.
Furthermore, this is a hard sell when it comes to Batman, given his continuity as known by fans.
We're talking about a man who saw his parents killed right in front of him as a boy; got hell from all his trainers as he prepared to become Batman; saw a close friend's double personality destroy him; after failing save a girl from drowning, got addicted to a steroid pill for which he had to lock himself in the cave for a month to recover from it(hence the unbelievability of the heroin addiction part); had his second Robin brutally murdered; had another sidekick (Barbara Gordon) paralyzed at the hands of the Joker; saw his other best friend, Gordon, stripped naked, tortured, and tormented with pictures of his daughter, also stripped, just after she had been shot and paralyzed; after going a week with less than a day's sleep rounding up all of Arkhum's inmates after they had escaped, got his back busted by steroid-laced madman; saw his beloved city have its own Black Death from the "Clench" virus, then further carnage when it got leveled by a 7 point earthquake.
It was made in 1949 when its shallow plot would have barely made political sense to movie goers; but wasn't released until 1957, four years after the US Air Force had trounced the North Koreans and Russians in aerial combat in the Korean War.
Also, it's hard to feel there's realism when both the good guys and bad guys are flying the same type aircraft, just painted differently.
But I wonder what it would've been considered if released back when it was written; Just as poor or rather interesting?
is a sham, the "Commies" are treated as the usual moron's we were taught to believe them to be in every other propaganda flic, but it still serves to remind us of a time when even seduction was innocently provocative.
It is hard to imagine that the movie-making craft had already been around over half a century when a story as preposterous as this was committed to celluloid.
You see, when you stick a red star on it, it becomes the spitting image of a MIG-15.
To play the sexy object of Chase's affection Aykroyd used his own wife which is kind of masochistic when Aykroyd's character shows no interest in her at all.
So what we are left with is many cheap jokes about camels, since Chase and Aykroyd are dropped in the Middle East, we get lot of innuendos from Chase when trying to bag Aykroyd's wife and finally we get lots and lots of images of rockets in space.
Two nudnicks (Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd) think they're being trained as spies for the United States government when actually they're being used as guinea pigs against the Russian defense.
However, when he's called away on some national security case (he's supposed to be like a ninja or elite power ranger sort of guy--yeah, right!
She stinks, so the boys find a greasy hobo, Rudy, with amazing soccer skills to coach the team (that's exactly what I did when my baseball coach disappeared when I was a kid--and we then went on to win the world championship...really!).
How come people are giving budgets to people to make bad films when there are plenty of creative talented directors out there struggling to make their first feature?!
But trust me when I tell you, that is the only reason (and one other I'll mention in a moment)  The scenes are shabbily put together (everything looks rushed).
Lets see what AAmir Khan would do when he does the remake.
4)Relentless Horror (Leatherface RUNS not speedwalks after his victims with a live chainsaw... there's no time to trip and fall or your booty is chainsaw bait)  5)The ability the film has to scare you with almost a complete lack of gore (the only "gory" scene is when Leatherface accidently cuts his thigh with the chainsaw).
when this director will direct a original film..Surya acting is very artificial.
I hear that this was a hit movie in Tamil when it was released Â so explains the taste of Indian audiences.
I remember when Aamir Khan gave a good bashing to Amitabh Bachchan and said that his movie "Black" Was a copied.Although I agree with him,but now Aamir Khan's new movie "Gajni" is a blatant copy of Memento .
And i could not believe it when I heard in the media that Aamir Khan said his movie is totally original.
There is not special in Ghajini.A copy of Memento Movie which far better with style.The Tamil Director has made the movie in the Indian way has the medical student searching for the character who has the problem amnesia.The flashback tells that the rich man who loves the girl till the end of first half does not tell her till he reveals the secret.The villain will come and hit the hero in the head when the heroine gets killed during the incident he losses consiousness.Avenging the twin villains will be done like Matrix in the climax Watch the English version better than this one.
I saw this movie and was impressed first only for one reason .The new concept of short term memory loss .But then later when I saw the original one Memento I was totally awestruck by how beautifully the screenplay was done ,you in fact live with the character ,which you can never feel for once in Ghajini .Well thats not the only flaw the whole brilliance and intelligence of Mememto is diminished in Ghajini .
Asin is graceful as his lively love and cute when she narrates the Bombay airport story.
She has also shown maturity in the scenes when the inevitable occurs.
The worst is when you have to see too much of him (I don't want to spoil that horrible suspense).
You'll know what I mean, when you watch Memento.
Before I start I did watch this movie twice, i didn't like it at all when I saw for the first first then watched it watched it second, i did find it bit more funny then before.
I was ten years old on that summer day when my little sister and I were taken to see this.
Saw this dud in London when I was heading East in '82.
Not having read the book on which this was based, I found myself wondering quite a lot during the movie: a) I wonder what's going on b) I wonder what this has to do with the plot (if there is a plot) c) I wonder why I rented this  The soundtrack is very poor and there are moments in the movie when the dialog is unintelligible.
The 'idea' is kind of cool: A man discovers that when he reads text in books, the things he reads about become reality.
I hate it when all I can think of while watching any movie is: "when will it end?"
I went to see this when it first came out at my local cinema, I was excited about the movie it looked like it could have been great.
The effects were good when they were in existence but they were so few and far between that it was almost pointless having them, they could have saved themselves a lot of money by doing some creative shooting and just axing the SFX.
And that's when things get really good and inventive.
Granted the time has come to show something other than the time in Helen's life when Annie comes to live with her and teach her, but this is not the way to go.
The actors tries so much, too much, and when you do that you always stumble and fall.
Of course, at 4pm and 4am is when there isn't nothing worth watching on TV.
I know that I don't care when somebody tried to find their baby's daddy, or the guy turns out NOT to be the baby's daddy.
Hopefully, kids are in school when this trash is on but what about people unable to leave the house because of illness?
Basically it is a show that pretends to care when all it does it exploit its guests.
And how are we supposed to know what people are saying, when almost everything that comes out of their mouths is a "beeped" swear word, and then when they don't get the result they wanted they run off crying on stage or get violent?
I also don't like the construction of the show, recapping what the guests are saying before they arrive on the stage is unnecessary, when they can just say it when Maury asks them to.
Or, when Gregory Peck asks Martin Landau how many men he has left in Love Company.
I was a big fan of Maury Povich when he hosted "A Current Affair" back in the late 80's.
So when he got a chance to host his own show, it seemed very promising.
The therapist character was also incredibly annoying, that that she was completely unemotional and subdued the whole time, even when Adrian's character attempted to murder her.
When I rented this movie, I had very low expectations......but when I saw it, I realized that the movie was less (a lot less) than what I expected.
Are we using that word like folks used the word "ghetto" when they didn't know how the hell to describe something?
Local physician Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve) and government scientist Dr. Susan Verner (Kirstie Alley) join forces when the women simultaneously give birth," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis, "and the reign of terror begins."
He didn't know that Hollywood didn't know, or maybe didn't care, that he was a black man, so when he was told his character would be featured prominently in the movie he assumed a well known black actor would be cast in the role.
In this version John Carpenter, the director, gives us a livelier opening in full color, presenting the cast of characters, which is an okay choice, but when the spell descends on the small town and scenes show us unconscious bodies all over the place, the visuals are accompanied by an irritating assemblage of electronic noises that, one supposes, are designed to be "eerie" or "spooky" but simply don't compare to the matter-of-fact but ominous silence of the original.
Even the more promising projects floundered when confronted with his increasingly pedestrian handling.
More like Village of the Darned, the most mysterious thing about it is just how Michael Pare managed to get such prominent billing when he doesn't even make it past the title sequence.
We're the Brits really that blasÃ© when confronted with terror bombings, destroying their homes?
It's sometimes said that Gregory Peck is a wooden actor and I guess I'd agree he's nobody's idea of Cary Grant when it comes to light comedy.
The special effects are mostly terrible - when Kristel is in full-beast mode, she looks more like a werewolf than a vampire!
Only things go terribly wrong when her target is murdered before she can make a clean getaway.
Unfortunately, it's at this point, when our expectations are highest, that BURGLAR begins to fall apart.
I recently saw this movie in a bargain bin at a store and became excited when I read the back cover.
I eagerly popped it in the DVD player when I got home and it starting off fairly promising with a suspenseful burglar scene and cool 80's soundtrack music.
Lot's of movies had soldiers and sailors bucking the system, living it up and playing small time rackets ala McHale's Navy but when the chips came down you could count on them to come through.
They were called upon to be with Theodore Roosevelt when he followed them up San Juan Hill in Cuba with the Rough Riders.
In reality, the US military has been at its busiest when there are not conflicts going on.
In a time when made for television films from HBO in particular and Showtime et al seem to be taking more chances with riskier topics than those flooding the theater screens, along comes CARRY ME HOME with a thud that hearkens back to the whiny tearjerkers of twenty years ago.
Marlboro, NY 1947, a time when the country is recovering from WW II, which includes the families of GIs killed in the war and the economy in ruins.
It just goes to show that even a work of genius can be destroyed when placed in the wrong hands.
In the end, Ann Miller's character dumps her wealthy fiancÃ©, and William Wright, when questioned as to whether he loves her, steals Clark Gable's line, "YES!
Being a lover of both when done well I found Darkside Blues yo-yoed from obvious imagery to ridiculous obscurity.
Other viewers have summed it up perfectly with the word vague, but ambiguous can be applied liberally when describing this movie.
Generally international trade creates losers only of those not taking part, but when your currency goes down the pipe you might not be so happy.
and then when you try to remember it later you can't.
I saw this film when I was a student back in 1988 or 1989.
Could be...could be that when it moved deeper into violence and intrigue, into dramatic seizures(!)
Sure, the Eastwest "pan and scan" person probably was asleep when this cropping atrocity was perpetrated, but that doesn't explain the poor dubbing, poor acting, poor plotting, silly exploration of the landlady's attic by first a cigarette lighter and then a struck match (what DID happen to Julie's landlady, and, more importantly, WHY?
While watching this I began to think that "Il diavolo a sette facce" might be Italian for "women in goofy wigs" when it became more apparent that it probably meant "waste of 90 minutes".
It's one of those typical God awful movies they play on Sci-Fi channel when it's "Dinosaur Week."
The writing is terrible mainly because the subplot of the soldiers trying to capture the bad guy, but where the film really fails is when it takes an entire magazine to make the raptors stumble.
These soldiers are the WORST shots ever put on screen, as bullets hit twigs and branches 50 feet in all directions and occasionally clip the dinosaurs themselves; when the bullets do hit the raptors, it takes nearly a hundred shots to put them down.
The people couldn't shoot worth crap and when they did manage to get some hits on the raptors, the corny blood spat out and there wasn't even an entrance or exit wound.
And when there's a fast-paced action scene, the cameraman shakes the camera wildly to try to give the effect that the action's more realistic and scary than it really is.
Another thing I hoped was that they would make the raptors smarter than this... when hunting, they stood there and watched the people as they fired at them.
Man, seeing the previews of the movie hyped it up, but when I clicked on it to watch it it was painful to watch.
Spoilers omg its like a video game man like sum of the other reviews its so fake i laughed my head off when 1 of the raptors ran up and killed the bald headed seals dude lol!!!!!!!!!!!
and when the dude get chewed up at the end .
lol and when the raptors follow the helicopter into the water man what does that even suppose to mean i mean how can they follow when their that small and the ocean is that deep????
it don't make sense i mean I've seen some goofy special effect tricks in my day but this has to be 1 of the worst ones I've ever seen man its just stupid i mean even i could tell it was fake when i saw the first Raptor man i mean i know all effects is fake but when u can even tell its fake first off then ya thats bad  another thing that i laughed about this movie is wat one of the other guys said about SEALS pose to be a crack shot and then in this movie they don't even aim at nothing and half the rounds they fire r misses man ?
And a second, more important, lesson: when you do watch this, keep your expectations as low as humanly possible.
And when they get shot?
the raptors look terrible, especially when shot at, apparently the effects are similar to the video game DOOM where the blood splats occur for a second and disappear.
And when a "Raptor attacks someone, in less than two seconds there's nothing but a blood stain!
Now when I say bad I mean by today's standards, if the film was released 25 years ago it might have been received better.
The raptors were funny to watch simply because when ever they would get hit with a bullet it would make a really unrealistic blood splat and then just disappear without a bullet hole or any mark at all.
During the scene where Hack and Jamie are holed up in the plane wreckage, their breath is clearly visible when they speak.
Actually, there is some good CGI in the movie, like when they're in the cave which is the "incubator" for the raptors.
But most of the raptors that are running around in the woods, well, they look a little worse than the ones in The Lost World TV show, and when the SEALS shoot at them and blood starts spurting out, it's straight out of a video game.
While I can't blame MOONBIRD completely (after all, Columbia studios, Creston Studios and others produced cheap animation well before MOONBIRD), it is shocking when you compare the ultra-simple Eric Carle-style cartoon here with gorgeous MGM or Looney Toons cartoons in their heyday.
Not really, though I'm sure you'll see it when it hits cable..
The only good thing to say about this film is, it has Christopher Eccleston in it, so maybe next time when they re-make it better, set in England with out the stupid commercial, American-ness they'll have him again.
Well, I have to say i wasn't expecting much from the movie when I saw the trailer.
People should beware when movies of the same genre appear in big numbers; it will mean that at least 3 of 4 will be mediocre,bad or no redeeming value,whatever.
Yet, the prophecy from which he was unaware, suddenly takes part over his life, when he mets "The Raider";he pursues Will,with some dogs you wont see again, he babbles something like "Give me the signs" and runs away scared of some people that calls themselves "Old Ones".
One of my friends almost guessed it during an ariel shot of the 'village' when she said "it looks a bit German doesn't it?"
The setting for the book held half of the mystery as did the time when it occurred.
Even when they try, they only get killed or injured.
He goes back in time when he sees a sign.
Will is driven by self-pity and only gets interested in the battle when he finds he has real power -- and then he becomes a rather self-righteous little jerk.
The biggest question is what were they thinking when they disregarded the story contained in the book?
That's quite an amazing feat when you consider it centers around a kid with numerous superhuman powers, and surrounds said kid with themes of time travel, villains who can summon swarms of crows and snakes in an instant, and an apocalyptic snow storm that could bring about the end of the world.
At one point, Will's younger sister discovers her brother's power first hand when she accidentally travels through time with him.
The last time a superb book-turned-rubbish-movie angered me this much was when I was forced to see Jim Carrey prance around as Count Olaf, who should've been one of the greatest villains to scare the wits out of little kids everywhere.
I was beside myself with glee when I first heard of this movie.
* EDIT: I urgently have GOT to add severe corrections to the following text, but reading thru it, you'll see I do by myself uncover the lies of this movie, when I write that Mitnick "just accessed some data":  I read thru the other comments.
But we only stand up when we OURSELVES got nothing' to eat.
The movie does a good job between not too obviously demonizing hackers and between in fact doing exactly that, for example, when Kevin is shown having trouble getting along with a girlfriend.
Although when i first watched the film i liked it.
The movie is fine, but what makes me flush it down the drain is that the people creating it portray it as a true story, when it is in fact BS!
"takedown", when you take into perspective the articles/books john markoff has written about his dealings with kevin mitnick [and the subsequent bling-bling-cash-money], is just a lot of lipservice for him and shimomura.
No one has as much as a backpack on them, but suddenly about five thousand candles appear all over the house to illuminate their fun and games and right when you get into double digits counting the fake slap-on-the-shoulder scares, a psycho pops up to plant lethal booby traps everywhere.
He believes in carrying out orders whatever they may be, but his attitude is put to the ultimate test when he is instructed to lead an attack on a tactically insignificant hill in the dying days of the war.
The film is at its best when delivering its anti-war sensibilities, especially the bitter scenes showing honest young soldiers losing their lives for no particular reason.
Back when I was a kid in kindergarten, we always used to sing a song about a crocodile named Sophie and, according to the lyrics, her jaws were never closed because she always gossiped about the rest of the animal kingdom.
Gustave is big, but not over-the-top big, and he looks genuinely menacing when speeding through the swamps and destroying cages of solid steel.
It drives me up the wall when a scene featured in a trailer isn't in the movie, but I can understand the editing process.
As well, how dare Hollywood Pictures have the gall to advertise a horror movie when it is a lame excuse of a somewhat political agenda.
I was so mad when i realized the killer was not going to be a human, and also that the advertisements fooled my friends and i (probably as planned).
I, along with other viewers,was duped into thinking that this was about a serial killer when in fact it was about an animal that kills humans.
All I know is that when I started watching the movie & realized that it was just another "Gator" movie I was not only disappointed, but just plain mad.
I like movies where I'm wrong when I guess what comes next.
this was the worst movie ever....i can't believe i paid to see it... this movie tricked you into see it by claiming "based on a true story of a serial killer still at large" please...very very mad...i really would like to beg people to not see that movie...they'll thank me when they see it on tbs in a couple of years or something...and one more thing why did the black guy die???
one of my favorite scenes was when they meet the hunter and for like the next five minutes all his dialog was exposition.
my other favorite was when they meet the shaw-man and hes like having a spasm.
Even though some of the action sequences are kind of interesting,(with the civil war and all), and the special effects are okay, it just doesn't make up for the film's garish cheesiness (seriously, when the crocodile was chasing Orlando Jones through an open field, was it supposed to be serious?).
We do get the Croc and when it was on screen it was a bad sucker unfortunately they opted for more CGI then you could shake a stick at but it was not of "The Mummy/Mummy Returns" crappiness so I guess we can let it slide to a point but would a prosthetic monster Croc be too much to ask for in some of the scenes as it would have been more effective.
It actually starts off quite well and shows promise, but when the movie more-or-less forgets about one of it's main stars - The Crocodile - it slips into a boring movie about a group of people being attacked by angry African soldiers rather than being a movie about a group of people being killed off by a big nasty croc.
The movie isn't all bad though, the crocodile is quite nasty when it pops up, there are one or two nice, brutal kills, some laughs and good CGI for the crock - as well as like I said before, good acting and a good cast.
Wait for late night TV or pick it up when it's a bargain...but either buy some alcohol with it or watch it really late...cause it is one boring flick and you'll probably fall asleep due to it's slowness.
The script was also in some ways done in poor taste and wasn't well thought out, like I'm not offended easily usually when it comes to racial jokes, but Orlando going on about slavery in Africa went a little too far and was ridiculous.
Some person who was so pregnant she could hardly walk, but seemed just fine stalking down the rabid killer at the end...oh, and she was in the snow when she did it.
I'm sorry when a punk documentary includes these bands you know its complete bullshit.
You know, I had to laugh when I saw the "I'm gonna die' guy under the influence.
The star of the film is Lila Leeds, a promising starlet who had very minor roles in earlier films, but achieved worldwide notoriety when she was arrested along with Robert Mitchum and other for smoking pot in 1948.
She spent several months in jail, and when she was released this was one of the few film roles she was able to get.
Believe it was the best war movie when it comes to depicting what it was like for a ground pounder in korea.
Now on to DBGT, it makes me sad when I have to comment so bad on something in-line with the dragon ball series.
I have nothing against the music style from DBGT but Bruce Faulconer's music style in DBZ should have been continued in DBGT, I was so upset when I didn't hear the good old Bruce Faulconer music playing within the battle scenes in DBGT.
Why oh why give vegeta a hair cut, since saiyans hair stays the same from when they were born, vegeta's hair was so awesome in DBZ, unlike DBGT.
While dragon ball and dragon ball z are two of the best animes ever created the pitiful ending that it was given doesn't do it any justice.Dragon Ball GT was clearly poorly written while it was some what entertaining it is a utter disgrace to previous dragon ball sagas.The fact that is was canceled was shame enough.The creators should have just ended it with Dragon Ball Z as the original plan was.Another thing,Goku in his super saiyan 4 form is as cocky as Vegeta since when Goku has the cockiness of Vegeta.All he is babbling about is what he is capable of when really there doesn't seem to be much strength in that form.Its Super Saiyan 4 for God sakes at Super Saiyan level 1 he seemed to had more power.How the hell you could get trashed so much at level 4?Very disappointed in this stupid end to a brilliant anime saga.
This dud was in the theater for one week before it disappeared, and when I went I was the only person in the audience!
Everyone loves a love-story, a sort of 'princess and the pauper', or in this case, 'maid and the prince'.But when the lead actress, trying to woo this 'prince', lives on a quiet street in a seaside town, in a three story house, with wealthy parents and a scholarship at a grammar school, the story is meaningless.
You know you're watching a bad film when a cinema room filled with the film's key audience, young girls, is deathly silent throughout what was meant to be some sort of modern girly coming of age comedy, and the only laugh you get is when a Steve Jones makes an almost cameo-like appearance, and turns out to be a homosexual, which for every one who watched the film who was over 16 had already guessed.
I think that they were trying ti make it too much like Bend It Like Beckham, when really the books have enough merit to make their own, even better film.
This movie was rated PG when i went to see it, it should be PG 13.
I think when movies like Saving Private Ryan or Platoon came out people thought that these represented "new" insights on the war movie.
Obviously there was a major plot point when I wasn't looking.
So, after a lot of boring events laced with clichÃ©s that are too tiresome to think about, let alone write down, Georgia and her bestie, Jaz, split up and throw catty insults at each other during a netball game, the grand, dramatic finale when Georgia stomps on Jaz's foot.
I begun reading the Georgia Nicholson series when I was around 15.
I haven't read the book therefore when I was about to watch this film, I really didn't know what to expect, and quite frankly I found it very boring and quite tedious.
Yet even the usual standards of embarrassment I normally feel about queuing with a Who video were intensified when I saw K-9 and Company in a sale for a fiver and went to "treat" myself.
Producer John Nathan-Turner was never really conversant with the word "taste" and so you just KNOW when K-9 mentions the Doctor the incidental music will segue into a skit of the old Who theme.
There were also several instances of foreboding-the wife telling the nanny that she won't be back for a while and when the dog breaks free and swims to the boat as if to save the wife.
Think about that when u see this!
The commentator only rarely speaks, and when he does, his comments are gibberish and just to poke fun at the mayhem what unfolds.
That FRAUD- trying to pretend he's a big time movie producer, musician, alleging that he graduated high school when he was 12 years old, etc.
This makes the film just that much more disturbing if you ask me because when you're looking at live and in motion footage and can see exactly what led up to that person's death, one has a tendency to want to play that terrible scene over and over in their head for days after; and for me it isn't always done intentionally, it's just that it get's in your head and doesn't want to leave until you are able to focus your thoughts on something more pleasant instead until it goes away...which is easier said than done I'm afraid!
Please wake me up when they release "Wrath of the Spider-Man!"
I mean he was portrayed as somewhat of an idiot and someone who doesn't get anything, even the part when he was eating the dog food was completely wrong for the character he was supposed to play.
The fighting scenes for one was very slow, it seemed like they were both scared of injuring each other when they were fighting, even though they were wearing god knows what inches thick.
I mean an apocalyptic world is a good setting for a movie I've found with watching others such as Children of Men or The Matrix, but the difference between those movies and this one, is that they were very well written and everything about them was great and provoked the right reactions out of you when you watched them.
You could get them from the huge Sears catalogue when I was a kid Â and I think director James Tucker got one for Christmas one year and based the mask on the memory.
The visual of the prune-face mask becomes relevant when one of the crazies, Edgar, escapes and dons the mask before embarking on a murderous and pillaging rampage that ends in an abduction of Delilah (Bacelar) and the quest for her rescue by boyfriend Brandon (Joshua Nelson).
And she runs into a very unexpected turn of events when trying to escape from LA (if only Kurt Russell had been there).
One laughable premise is followed by another when the feds order the evacuation of Los Angeles, and we're asked to believe that the local and national authorities can 1) actually carry this out, and 2) do it in just a couple of days.
This guy doesn't recognize a spoof when he sees one!
But please watch this movie, and when I say watch I really mean purchase and I'll give you two reasons.
When I was a kid I saw a promo for A Kid in King Arthur's Court and got really excited for it but when I actually sat down to see it didn't make much of a impression on me and for the most part I forgot it.
However, everything goes wrong when they hold up a small-town bank.
As it turns out, when Rudy shot Jed, Rudy's bullet lodged in Jed's cell phone and Jed resolves to catch up to Rudy.
Moreover, when Jed tries to flag Hunt down, the sheriff sees the jacket taken off his murdered deputy and shoots first before he can confirm Jed's story.
George Parkman's 13 year duty has arrived and promises to sacrifice his granddaughter Alexandra who was sold into child pornography by her father when she was six years old.
I just found myself gazing at her legs more than paying attention to the dialogue but then that's probably always going to the case when it comes to Melissa Bacelar.
In particular, the scene with the Russian woman telling the story of how Brandon had "Pink Eye" when he was younger just felt like padding.
Then there is the boyfriend who raises objections over a certain priest as he kind of gets fresh with the main girl and it is obvious and the girl keeps going "Don't attack him" and stuff, though if I were the boyfriend I would have dumped the gal when she told me why she was hesitant about having sex as she had a bit to much baggage.
Watchable in a bad movie sort of way, its the sort of thing that is best seen only when going through a multiple film set since its not worth the time or the effort to see a film like this as a stand alone.
The characters are uninspired, the sets are run of the mill, and the killings are non-existent (despite one okay moment when Tunneler drilled a guy in the crotch.
Worst of all, the puppets hardly ever make an appearance, and when they do they are obviously being held up by just-out-of-the-frame stage hands.
what I don't understand is why is he carving a humanoid body, when he ends up as a TANK!?!?
Tank spends the whole movie carving this puppet out of wood, when he is transferred into it, there's a TV screen?
Honestly, I have no idea what Gregory Peck was thinking when he decided to make this incredibly awful movie.
Catch the sequel, #7, when it comes out, I guess.
One more thing: Quebec's critics rarely say bad things of Quebec's own movies because of the small market and that they want to protect themselves but even Le Dernier Tunnel got bad reviews so believe me when I say it's worst than bad !
But its the froth of the horror indie slaughterhouse floor, and its reminiscent of the 80's when horror was low budget and raw, without trying to be.
Hell, I like low budget, foreign made Westerns, especially when they are made by Italians and starring someone like Lee Van Cleef.
The most annoying aspect of the film is that as you sit there witnessing it's length you can successfully predict what will happen next right up until the moment when I decided I'd had enough of this crap.
This was during his later years when he was getting a bit long in the tooth to believably play those nasty, tough guy parts... but he is still the most interesting thing in this movie.
Forest Whitaker is a religious TV host who does not seem to care to much about God, but when disaster strikes his personal life he remembers Him and starts praying and believing - are we supposed to believe as viewers that this sincere?
During the 80's and 90's,director Abel Ferrara was one of the leaders of the independent cinema making amazing films which challenged the spectator.But,his recent works are far away from his previous works.New Rose Hotel and R Xmas were a little bit disappointing but they were interesting experiments.But,I do not know what was Ferrara thinking when he was making Mary,a tedious and boring movie and,by my point of view,a huge let down in his career.During 83 minutes,the movie shows us three stories which are totally boring and uninteresting.I think Ferrara wanted to make an analysis about the religion but,still with that,I think he had to do a better work to make a coherent connection between the stories.For me,it is very disappointing that Ferrara,who made excellent films with very little resources(like,for example,Bad Lieutenant,The Addiction,Ms.45 and The Body Snatchers),was behind this crap.I hope Mary is only an unexplainable false move in Ferrara's career and that,he will get redeemed soon.But I cannot recommend Mary,which is a tedious film.
Modine and Whitaker, both plainly uncomfortable playing their roles, end up giving us melodramatic performances that, when arriving at the moment of spiritual catharsis, cause them to start chewing up the scenery.
Humphrey Bogart is an independent gunrunner in Damascus in 1925, when Syria is fighting off the occupation of French military invaders.
He killed himself in 1965 when he was 55.
I first saw The Zoo Gang when I was a child of about five.
But I would also have to say that Sirocco takes place at a time when certain movements and issues were coming to the fore.
My mom is a semi fan of Christopher Walken and this appealed to her I guess though I am usually baffled by what she picks up when I let her choose a movie to watch.
I liked them when I was in primary school , but that passed almost 20 years ago .  "
I was living in Prescott when The Zoo Gang was being filmed.
Across the street from the Hassayampa was the old Library, I used to go to that Library when I was a little girl before they built the new one.
The hill that they take the motor home down on is Elk's Hill, we used to sled down that hill when we were kids in the winter when it snowed.
I went to see this in the theater when it came out.
For some reason the director fell in love with shots of them leaping through the air in slow motion, Six Million Dollar Man style, toward our heroes when they attack.
Needless to say they are slow and unthreatening and when they speak sound like gay Hispanic, lisping Daleks.
Later on in the movie she wimps out when she can't beat Ilias and Mace and promises to make herself the sex-slave of some ancient warrior dude if he kills them for her.
The bolts can also shoot through solid rock when necessary.
Hey, we can all use a good spurting wound once in a  while, but when you get into spurting wound overkill, it gets boring.
And (**spoiler, maybe**) when Ally Sheedy's character is talked into wearing a painters smock on a first date (she's a designer for God's sake!)
This horrible picture really shows what the 80's horror genre was capable of when it comes to the blood factor.
The worst part of the movie is when Kids are showed acting/playing as kidnappers.
Gary, a rather bad dime-store romance novelist, soon after watching a sensationalist tabloid news show about the recent rash of people that have been dying in their sleep, is worried about his girlfriend who is having trouble sleeping (he's an insomniac himself) So when his war veteran neighbor tells him about the Sandman he's frightened (not by the vet's story, more his demeanor) add to this the fact that Gary's worthless leech of a cousin has just moved in to his trailer.
So when the feud with their rivals get out of hand, they rivals take advantage of the lack of property claims and so the Zoo Gang (named for their rock club) as the underdogs, have to do what they can to save the club.
It's not sexy, it's like watching a medical documentary, or when the woman runs across the screen in Airplane!
Overall though, while it might be worth a watch once either on TV or at a friend's (when they've rented it), it's not one that I would generally recommend.
Upon seeing what they had wrought all three committed suicide when they were overcome with deserved guilt.
When it's over, you don't feel like you learned anything, you don't feel like you enjoyed it, you don't feel relieved when it's over.
I expect all of those things when watching a movie like this.
Look, I know that there are things that directors do to save time when shooting a low-budget film.
Because when a film gets ANY kind of theatrical release (even if it's only a week) and the distributor (especially a distributor as big as Lion's Gate) asks people to pay $9.00 to see it, I expect that film to adhere to a certain amount of professionalism.
If you look on the back of the DVD box, you'll notice that the word "attraction" is spelled wrong (talk about inexcusable and amateurish) and just try not to laugh when, in the special features, one of the writers (the one with the man boobs) admits that it took him four months(!)
You can tell when production level is a hindrance to relaying a well executed plan and if some of these film makers were to get their hands on decent resources I'm pretty sure their final project would be much more enjoyable.
I knew I was in for trouble when that line was uttered early in the film.
But when a film like Dark Ride comes along with no regard for originality or even any attempt to really be good, it just makes me angry.
But when I feel insulted, I feel I have to speak up.
Um, did anyone actually see any tracks when the teens were roaming around, going in all kinds of directions, rooms, etc?
Reminded me of Farley Granger disappearing early in The Prowler (1981) and even when a character in Scream 2 was just NOT there for 2/3 of the film and shows up again near the end.
go on about it being an homage to those 70s and 80s slasher flicks, including The Funhouse (which didn't scare me when I saw its initial run in theatres in 1981).
I first saw and read the cover and it sounded promising.It was nothing like "Joy ride"(which is my favorite movie)or "I saw what you did last summer" like it implies.If i rented it instead of buying the bloody amateur movie i wouldn't be as mad.There was nothing interesting about it including the ending.If the movie had a bigger budget for better effects and better camera's and actors it might be OK.It did look promising up until they all got to the motel.After that it was lame and annoying.The characters were so aggravating that you wanted them to get killed off as quick as possible.The part I hated the most was when the 3 survivors had a man trapped at his home and tied up.They all screamed at him to shut up like a bunch of psycho's while he was pleading "you have it wrong it wasn't me".This Gawddamned scene made my blood boil it was so painfully annoying.
I'm not sure when the name changed from the trip to hell ride, but I had to look up the director/writer to find this movie.
This movie worked as a mockery of art school, it didn't work when it turned dark.
For example when they make the students compliment the childish paintings of cars and tanks.
We stayed to the end of the film (which seemed an eternity) but just when you think it can't get any worse, it does.
This movie tries to be intelligent and witty, but totally falls short when it can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a satire, a murder mystery...etc.
They obviously have their own agenda, but in fact the picture in question (which suggests eyes seen through a veil of hair) actually has a certain amount of expressive power, and when Jerome objects, you expect him to say, 'My five-year-old nephew could do better stuff than that!'
Maybe Zwigoff knew all along that he'd attract a certain audience - the type who assumes it's coming to sneer at these tired, overblown, kiss-ass stereotypes - when, in fact, the tables were turned and he's actually laughing at our banal sense of superiority, not to mention our eagerness to project greatness onto any schlock he throws our way.
Of course, this is a propaganda film, so the upper class are portrayed as fat, hysterical beast-people and the lower-class are all rough-hewn and beautiful, but WHO CARES when the movie is this good!
The firsthalf of the film was amusing, but when it turned extremely dark in the final act, it just didn't feel right.
I had remembered it as very creepy and scary, but the last time I saw it was when I was 12 or so.
Even the occasional random dip into soft core pornography with the lovely Lisa Bonet does not raise even the slightest flicker of interest, neither when the buggies come and circle round our "political prisoner" (He was imprisoned for writing a slogan on a wall, oh yes...).
Most of the gags had been done before and better in other films and on TV by the time this was made so it was like watching reruns of reruns.3 Chairs for Lefty, which stars Bill Murray is rife with the sort of prison jokes that have been around since the 1930's,including giving Lefty a roast to cook when he finally goes to the chair.
The daredevils in Daredevils Of The Red Circle consist of three circus stuntman who when the little brother of one of them is killed in an arson fire on that circus.
And just when things couldn't get any worse than Helena Bonham Carter's speaking with an annoying lisp, enter Martin Short.
This was especially true when the love Keitel had for Winslet became apparent and he began chasing her up the hill.
The comic relief became even more apparent when Keitel had the vision of the three Indian women singing to him.
There is hardly a life lesson to learn from this movie, except one should perhaps not spend one's life on the Australian countryside, and the fact that sexuality is a strong force that's easily misinterpreted when it comes to true spirituality.
Why make such an enormous issue of Daisy's choice, when we all know what will satisfy Breen almost as soon as the picture starts?
The detective is made to appear as a buffoon when he is actually GETTING EVERYTHING RIGHT.
We're supposed to be amused when minor characters are interviewed on TV saying how strangely Pigeon acted -- after everyone assumes his wife is dead -- but he WAS acting strangely, so strangely that you wonder why no one reported him to the police while he was staying at the resort.
Carole Landis was 29 when she committed suicide.
I don't mean to be so U.S.-centric, but come on - when one of your main characters has to have his every sentence translated, it gets awfully annoying, and calls undue attention to itself.
Since we don't care about, or even understand, the characters we are cut off from their personal rapture at the landing; since the aliens' plans or general purpose is never articulated (or even suggested), there is no tension generated by wondering what they are going to do when they get here; and since the entire movie has been so deliberately slow and ponderous, this scene has to be even slower - you know, to show how important and climactic it is.
Hated it when it came out, still feel the same.
Talk about a time when this film could have used one of those two composers or James Horner instead.
Neary is an electrician who experiences a "close encounter" one night when a UFO seems to attack his car, and then flies off into the distance.
Many will disagree with me when I say that "Close Encounters of the Third Kind" is an overrated, disappointing motion picture with few redeeming qualities.
Why in the 7th game of the series do all the Detroit fans cheer when Pittsburgh wins?
Why in two different games when the visitors are up the scorekeeper changes the home team's score?
Why did it look like the card was signed in ink when Wagner asked to borrow a pencil?
Why didn't he buy something to protect it when he was at the card dealer?
Why wasn't he more upset when Wagner threw the cards in the fire.
Mrs. Young offers him a few bucks to clean out her attic and when Joe finds an extremely rare and valuable Honus Wagner baseball card, he runs home without telling Mrs. Young he's found the card.
There's no explanation for the transformation but without it, the film's scenarist will not be able to pull of the clumsy scene in the film's denouement, when Joe takes the place of Honus in the last game of the 1909 World Series.
While Cobb was known for being overly aggressive on the field and having a bad reputation amongst his fellow ballplayers, he's turned into a virtual criminal when he attempts to blackmail Joe after stealing the Honus Wagner baseball card.
'The Winning Season' admirably attempts to recreate the look of the "Dead Ball" era but as other reviewers have pointed out, little attempt has been made to be historically accurate (yes, why do the Detroit fans cheer when Pittsburgh wins the Series?).
And when the teens refuse to sell it to him, he turns the whole town of middle-age and senior ogres against them.
...in September 1986 when I was 13 and caught it on opening weekend - the only weekend it appeared at a theater - because it sucked so bad no one saw it besides me and some others that barely helped it crack that weekend's top 10 grossing film.
I like acting and all, but when movies go on about "being an actress" and "trying to make it big" and all that Hollywood crap, I lose interest fast.
For instance, I doubt very much that the scenes when we see the actresses ice skating or dancing would have been included in an American production.
This moment happens when Vernon and Thorson are shot.
I can`t say I laughed once, and the only good feeling this movie gave me was relief when it ended.
I saw this movie three years ago on tape when i rented it.
i came across shark attack 3, shark zone, shark hunter, when i came across a tape of shark attack.
while walking home, i had to stop every five seconds to look at the boxart and read the back and look at the tape, it took me an hour to walk 5 hundred feet when it usually takes me 20 minutes.
  I have just seen this movie and have to say that it was pretty poor, I mean there are hardly any attacks and when there are they are all "stock footage" of actual sharks.
I wouldn't bother with this film, and for starters the back cover of the film stuff it up by saying that it's a hammerhead when it's clearly a "great white".
The director in my opinion should have focused more on the shark attacks because in the movie there isn't enough to satisfy the audience, even though the sharks shown in the movie are actually real and cool to watch, the movie lacks any thrill or scary moments when the main cast actually comes face to face with the sharks.
"...which is pretty remarkable when you think about it.
The plot is fairly meaningless until the very end, when everything gets impossibly complicated.
It is about a woman who leaves her husband for no reason when she becomes pregnant.
I watched this whole story to find out the reasoning of a religious event that happens in the first 5 minutes of the movie with a sick child becoming well after a spring of water appears out of the ground, at the very end of the movie the spring appears again, when the lady who runs stops running, I don't see how the 2 relate to the story line that seemed to be full of holes, and how a woman can leave her child and have that child have peace suddenly at the end of the movie is a bit to far fetched for me!
Rose actually berates Cecilia for driving the seriously injured Son to the hospital when there was no other reliable means to safely reach the place as though Cecilia had taken a joyride!
It's easy to go back to "rediscover your roots" when you have a gorgeous house with the best view in the city and a beautiful girl (portrayed by Kelly Hu, quite obviously not Chinese, let alone Shanghainese) who conveniently speaks English waiting for you.
Or, when someone just steps off a trans-Pacific airline flight, how likely is it that they are immediately going to go someplace where -- you guessed it -- women are eagerly waiting to pleasure him?
The photographer lost his head strangely when facing the unattracting but typical Greek woman.
She looks better when her hair turned into fully white.
The other brides on board are also strange when throwing themselves into the arms of the buyers.
Adorable Cora Sue Collins plays "Pearl" Shirley Temple-like -- this is understandable, given the time of release -- consider, especially, the scene when Ms. Moore and her little girl take swords, begin a dancing march, and chant, "Boom!
The idea is good and I have nice memories from the 80s when I saw some parts of it.
Now when watching it with the kids I feel cheated by my own memories..
This perhaps is the most frustrating aspect as quite often one is left with an uncertain feeling... Was there something to be learned - ow was that a simple joke.. Then when the story goes to describing real historic facts these are often fast paced listings of years, names of important people/fights, etc.. Perhaps that is the part for adults as the kids have no chance of learning from that level of details coming at that pace..  Transitions from the life of individuals to the world events is often surprising and would benefit from better justification / preparation.
I feel he has the chops and when younger was a sexy, bad boy, actor.
all things considered this movie is pretty unremarkable.it has too many slow spots with nothing happening.then when there is some action,the scenes are way too long and protracted.it's your typical "nut job takes control of an airplane and the good guys try to regain control" movie.i also found it even less realistic than most movies of the genre.the dialogue was pretty lame too.the characters are your run of the mill characters for these types of movies.the acting wasn't great,either,though i did like Ice-T,who plays a federal agent in the movie.the runtime is about 94 minutes with end credits,but it sure felt a lot longer.the bottom line for me,this movie added nothing new to the genre and was certainly not as good as any of the other movies of the genre.if i were you,i would check out "Turbulence" Passenger 57",Executive "Decision" and "Con Air",which are all better examples of the genre.for me,Sonic Impact is a 4/10
Also the outdoor scenes,when you see the airplane over snowy mountains... the jet, the helicopters.
The film is in English and is terribly predictable with Django digging up his fake grave which contains his machine gun coffin and just when all seems lost toward the end, the main villain's (Christopher Connelly) jealous servant sets Django free.
Besides, where does this guy get off being so high and mighty and, well, *preachy* when he's far from perfect himself?
I was a small child when this ran during its one season in 1970, and it had a profound effect on me, although at the time I had no idea why.
I especially like the very end, when she's reading the comic, and she says something like, "And off she went on her reign of terror, to vanquish her mortal enemies, of which there were many."
The comedians are funny when you do get to see them on stage, but most of the movie is spent looking at a "Raiders of the Lost Ark" map trace the trip across America, cut with footage of the tour bus and then an audience laughing.
Why was money spent on it when people in the world are going hungry?
I remember this one when it was passing on the french CBC Network.
It maybe bad and dumb for others, but leave your seriousness at the door when you'll watch Lance and Mata Hairi make the move on the Baron, the Dragon Lady and all the CHUMP villains...  A.P.E.
However, when his game stinks, the manager punishes him by sending him to pick someone up at the bus stop.
I was running a movie theater when this turkey came out.
It's now nearly 20 years since it was made, but my two daughters can still recite the entire dialog, and we still "crack-up" when we think about it!!!
Sometimes, however, the follow-ons can be a little disappointing when compared with the original, especially when the original is so brilliant.
Granted, AJ Johnson is funny in most of his roles, but when given nothing to work with, what can you do?
However, when chaos ensues through mixed-up receptions, Black and Blue find themselves on the run from angry customers, federal agents, and gang members.
Review: First off, let me inform you that this movie is put together like a live-action cartoon and never takes itself seriously, even when it wants to.
I used to love this movie when it came out when I was like 7 or 8.
Now that I look back on this movie I simply think of it as okay whereas when I was 7 or 8 I thought this was the junk.
Horrible friggin' movie I didn't like that movie when I 1st saw it and i now haaaate it.
I saw this when I was 11 and even though they say kids will laugh at anything,that's not necessarily true.
I watched Pink & Jeff go through their cue card read shtick but I sat there as blank faced & confused as Bart & Lisa Simpson when they don'tunderstand their parents.
What did the writers think when they watched the original?
The movie generates a lot of tension because we never know when the touch of a hand will trigger a new vision.
But when it doesn't even have the budget to pull it off?
I saw this many years ago when it first came out.
It reminds me of the funny segment from the movie UHF when they advertise the fake movie "Gandhi 2" and feature Gandhi kicking butt and driving a sports car.
I remember seeing this short film when it first aired on Amazing Stories in 1987 and I thought that it was the funniest thing I had ever seen.
I cannot get it out of my mind (I think the same thing as the robber at the end, every morning when I have to walk my dogs).
Its been awhile since i saw it but the one repeated thing that comes to mind is the character's inability to accept that no matter how little milk he puts in his cereal there is always some left when he's done eating.
That is what I thought when I got this film.
I wonder if Tsuruta had this in mind when he made this film.
I was prepared to enjoy the movie when I first got my hands on it.
Sienna Guillory plays Julie, a young au pair working in Italy and still traumatised by the death of her mother in a fire when she was 15.
Despite this, she works for a middle-aged couple (Derek de Lint and Alice Krige) looking after their infant child but before long, tragedy strikes when the baby is also killed in a fire.
Even thirty odd years ago when I first saw it.
Why in the world would anyone want to watch a remake of Dawn of the Dead, when you can watch the original?
The zombie action was good when you saw it, but that was sparse as most of the action took place in the warehouse.
It's only when I saw so many credits at the end I realised the 10 year old directing the film must have a lot of friends, who also must have seen the Australian film called Undead which used similar opening well sort of, but was one heck of a lot better, in fact it was good.
A stake-out drug sting operation is thwarted when the cops are interrupted by undead zombie bums whose condition derived from fallen meteorites carrying a type of infection.
Weatherman(Cazimir Milostan)is a television personality whose wife is pulled from his convertible by the zombie bums as he looks on in horror, abandoning his vehicle, intruding upon Mitch's warehouse as well, put to good use by Caesar when attempting, unsuccessfully, to retrieve his vehicle.
Soon, however, Caesar takes advantage(when Campbell saves him from being swarmed by zombies, risking his own life in the process)of an opportunity presented to him, and takes control of the group using his hand gun as a tool to do so.
The most memorable death sequence comes at the end when a face is ripped apart from the mouth.
What happens to a Hispanic gang and a Black gang when a meteorite causes the dead to rise?
It also doesn't help that the majority of the characters are essentially uninteresting and unlikable (even though the actors for the most part are actually better than expected), and when they die, you don't feel anything other than indifference.
I won't spoil it, but there was one potentially cool twist that came too late and fell flat when it was finally revealed.
This is obvious when Devgan talks in terms of $ instead of Rs to explain the exchange rate.
So after 5 years when he decided to make Shikhar, it's not an exaggeration to say that the same audience expected the film to be if not more, at-last 5 times more powerful and impact making than Sarfarosh!
There is nothing redeemable about the film, except Shahid Kapoor who has a reflection of youthful Shahrukh Khan when it comes to projecting honesty, passion and dedication.
So when you take portions of 'Swades', 'Bas Itna Sa Khwab Hai' and possibly scrapes of 'Guide' or 'Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman' and churn them together, you would have manufactured Shikhar!
But the fun of hating this movie (that occurs while they're cruising around L.A. drinking generic beer, which becomes banally involving) withers when the actual party begins, and for the next (what feels like an eternal) forty-five minutes we cut back and forth to various people who look like they're all buddies of the director as they drink beer, swear, philosophize, swear, drink beer, snort meth like it's cocaine, quote classic films (mostly Apocalypse Now), and swear some more: while drinking beer.
Not only is it memorable in the fact that it was written by a woman in a time when women were considered the lesser of the two sexes, but it also set up new standards for science-fiction and horror that were expanded even further with following plays and ultimately the 1931 James Whale film of the same name, which featured Boris Karloff as the mutinous, growling monster created from dead bodies fused with electricity.
But, when Branagh is about to have sex (finally) with Ms. Carter, Mr. De Niro interrupts.
Also it is hard trying to concentrate when the film is constantly switching from scene to scene, and it's jumpy camera is making you dizzy.
Karloff's make-up was green because when filmed under proper lighting (on B&W film) green make-up looks deadly pale, almost pure white, not because the monster in that film was supposed to be green.
Grown adults were pointing at the screen and laughing, and not just when John Cleese showed up.
You've got to wonder what people are thinking sometimes when making a horror film - did Branagh, or whoever had final cut of this thing, get chills up their spine at any point?
This film obviously has no understanding of the original plot (which is still current and worthy of discussion today), but the person(s) responsible did see "Bride of Frankenstein" and managed to screw up that plot as well when they tried to incorporate it into this film.
John Cleese's rabbit teeth were hilarious but by far the two most hilarious parts of the film were the look on Brannagh's face when the monster tells him to meet him up on the ice in a few days (he's thinking why not do it now????)
But the MOST ridiculous part was when Frankenstein tried to regenerate Elizabeth.
Why could he not make the one girl with the perfectly fine body come to life, but magically when he hacks off her head and stick's on his lovers, she sparks to life.
Yet this same moral reasoning does not apply when attempting to reanimate his murdered wife like 2 days later???
How is he able to count down perfectly to when the lightening will strike?
Given that there were only FOUR tenants in the whole block, wasn't it verging on the ridiculous to start killing them all off - what was he planning to do when they were all dead?
It was the first case in my life when I left the cinema at the half of the movie.
Top marks for scenery and lighting - the use of shadows when dealing with Batman is nearly an art form and they did well here.
As I warned, I am a batman fan and I cringe when there are blaring inaccuracies - as I did all throughout Batman begins - but when you have horrible errors like there are here... *shudder*.
We had Cindy on tape as kids but misplaced it when we moved.
This is absolute junk when you consider this was supposed to be a comedy.
There is no real suspense during the movie until the last 25 minutes or so when we are hoping to find out what happened to Saskia.
The only time worth watching the screen is when he is on it.
And when it attempts to recreate Dr. Strangelove (which is frequently), it borders on being unwatchable.
The only part which cracked a smile from me was when they were (trying) to sing "Born in the USA."
If that isn't bad enough, and this is a spoiler, (as if this movie was unpredictable to have that matter) the hero all but give up when he is lead to believe the great love of his life is dead only to be given renewed hope from a weed sticking up from a crack in the floor!
There are a couple of scenes which try to recreate the comic book feel like when Kenshiro kicks someones face & dislocates his jaw to an amazing extent or in the same sequence where he punches someone in the back & a big bulge appears on their chest from the force.
5) Ken doesn't scream when he punches people.
One thing of note though, is that the makers seemed to keep some of the shots from the anime (like when Ken and Shin jump kick each other).
I actually liked it during the first couple of minutes during the time, when the main character, Kenshiro (Gary Daniels) hadn't opened his mouth yet, but after he spoke and revealed, that besides the looks he hadn't slightest bit of acting talent I quickly stopped liking it.
My favourite scene of the film is when a Finnish ex-WWF wrestler and a (yes sad but true) member of parliament Tony Halme gets the smirk kicked out of his face.
It's the fighting that makes him so great, and when the fight scenes didn't deliver, there was so no hope for this movie.
His pacing and scene times are awful, he rips off tricks from movies such as "Requiem For A Dream" and when he isn't stealing ideas from other movies his camera work is boring.
As noted earlier, Tweed attempts to make use of every "neat" shot in Requiem for a Dream, and misses the mark completely, his reasoning being that such shots will add "depth" and "meaning" to the picture, when instead they come off as merely baffling.
This movie became a disaster at the end, when Chambers has been taken by tornado.
The ending is shocking when you put all the pieces together of what he has done earlier in the film leading up to this, even involving his children screaming to see how far it travels!
Perhaps the most hilarious scenes are the afore-mentioned rites, Ann Michelle's photo sessions (a modeling agency serves as a front for the coven) and especially when she, a newly-inducted witch, puts a spell on her rival Haines - having suddenly become an expert in the occult merely by reading a book on the subject (Michelle burns a photograph of Haines, and we see the latter's expression in it change gradually to reflect the pain she goes through!).
The film was actually shot in 1970 but the BBFC refused it a certificate - realizing, perhaps, that it was pure exploitation and not really a horror film at all; in fact, it only got released when the producers took the film to the apparently more lenient censor boards of individual towns, after which the BBFC relented!
The agent falls in love with one of the girls and the only lesbian scenes in this movie are two in which she looks at the girl in a mirror as she undresses and the other is when she kisses her.
Even though I was a kid when I saw the original, I can remember it being much more endearing and convincing than this Sharon Stone remake.
The first film was about what happens when the powerless get power.
And Sharon Stone's acting ability seems laughable when compared to Gena Rowlands, who originated the role in 1980.
The use of the bookends felt like it gave the film a more authentic feel at first, but when they were revisited at the end, I felt slightly cheated and still confused.
as i watched the movie, when the protagonist is presented with the choice of finding out what happened to Saskia by undergoing the exact same treatment, i almost turned the movie off.
The opening scenes establish the happy couple; an ominous turn ensues when they stop at a gas station and Saskia disappears.
Yet when the reality sets in, and the truth is revealed we almost wish the movie hadn't told us, just like Rex, who had his life destroyed by Saskia's unsolved vanishing, comes to the realization that maybe he would have been better off not knowing either.
The movie moves so subtly towards its shocking conclusion, that when it comes, we believe it.
As I watch John Travolta walking around looking like a Jamaican trapped in a KISS video, it makes me wonder was this the project he envisioned when trying so hard to get this sci-fi film off the ground.
What bugged me is that when he sends one of his men to his doom we never see an ounce of emotion.
I was watching TV this morning and saw a few minutes of the (far inferior) American version of this film, and asked myself why I was watching this when I have the original on DVD?
The glass that the aliens use for the dome appears to be almost a foot thick as it hits the ground, but this doesn't change the impact of a couple boxes of ammunition and explosives from causing a severe chain reaction when detonated from a central location on top of the dome.
I forgot to mention that when you implode the dome, various buildings will start blowing up... for no particular reason.
In all that time, the Psychlos never found Fort Knox, though gold is high on their shopping list, nor did they stumble on the jet fighters that the humans themselves find when the aliens send them out to find gold.
After returning the video I honestly asked the clerk that even when I'm very drunk to stop me from renting this movie ever again.
I thought the critics were exaggerating when they said how bad it was but they weren`t BATTLEFIELD EARTH is one of the worst films released by a major Hollywood studio.
Why do they think rats are the favourite food of humans when it`s the only thing they`ve seen humans eat ?
especially when they consider the " man animals " to be a primitive species .
Some day when you need a good laugh, rent this or borrow it from your local bad film collector.
However, when she claims to be attacked several times, the police and her doctor start to wonder if she is imagining it.
i don't know WHY the 70's loved doing this so much when the film's alternate titles are so much better .
The sheriff guards Ingrid's house until the morning, when the  deputies can come and dig up Frankie.
The sheriff also gets a surprise when Uncle Carl flies in from New  York.
I'm not exaggerating when I say that at least thirty minutes can be cut off this clunker without missing any plot lines whatsoever.
Number one on her list is the town rowdy Frankie who also works as the butcher in the local market when he's not having a very inappropriate relationship with the sheriff's seventeen year old daughter.
After this brief introduction, the movie follows a very religious woman named Ingrid, played by Swedish actress May Britt (the synopsis on my copy of this movie refers to her as a "religious young woman," but given that Ms. Britt was in her mid-forties when this was filmed, "young" may be a relative term here).
Unbelievably, we are expected to care when one of these ciphers gets killed (cue the cheap-looking mannequin) by Stalinists, or Fascists, or Anarcho-Syndicalists, or anti-Castro Cubans, or the CIA, or whatever.
You even have trouble hearing what the man says when English not is his native tung!
but when Bradley met that doctor i was no way, most doctors are NOT nice and pretty like that, that was so Hollywood "chance" meeting right there.
But when she fails to return to the car, panic ensues, and Rex begins a frantic search for his missing girlfriend.
And when that moment happens, it's scary because of how realistically depicted it is.
I like a passionate love scene as much as the next, but when you have EVERY sexual encounter involve the woman grinding away on top of the man (who of course isn't showing any of HIS private parts!)
Thus drama ensued...  Another scene that stretched my credulity followed quickly afterward when Greg Kinnear's character decides his body must feel the same pain as his heart and slices off the tip of his finger.
There has to be something wrong, when you start to sympathise with the second leads instead of the two leads, which is the main problem with Griffin Dunne's mildly amusing, nasty, mean and cruel romantic comedy about obsessed and crazy ex-lovers Matthew Broderick and Meg Ryan combining their powers to separate their past lovers Kelly Preston and Tcheky Karyo from one another by playing tricks on them.
What else happens when a bunch of stoned young men get together to make a movie on Grand Cayman?
The leading lady was set up to have turned sixteen that very day, when Orlando Mister-Twickenham Bloom pops over to make love with her.
Jeffrey Dahmer, the serial killing cannibal, might have not gotten caught when he did if it weren't for that horrific stench of decaying corpses that permeated from his apartment; because on the surface he looked and acted just like a quiet, ordinary guy.
What follows is the unfolding of a mystery that moves so painfully and methodically, developing into such a real horror story that you find yourself stunned when the credits roll.
It really makes me mad to see fellow Canadians praising such a dumb movie, especially when its as horrible as this.
A lot of times you can find out just how good a singer is when you hear them in person, instead of the studio making them sound perfect.
I found it amazing this movie was given any credibility (however underground it may be), as every aspect was entirely banal and seemingly ignored during production (note when a passing SUV passenger sticks his head out the window to look at the camera crew).
Other characters tell us what was going on between this unholy trio instead of just showing Ted, Generosa, and Danny interact (except when she goes off her nut.)
I enjoy politically incorrect movies when they make fun of people's ignorant perspectives, but this film was flat out racist.
I thought when I hired the DVD, that there were subtitles available but after a phone call to the Video shop, I was informed that if you look closer, there was no tick beside the word, subtitles.
The sun sets on their short romance when they stop at a rest area and she disappears.
Just when you think Affleck can't get any worse, he, and his movie choices do just that...reliably so.
It is hard to believe that someone with an academy award for screen writing (undeserved, boogie nights deserved it)can't select even a halfway decent script when it arrives for him.
As one of the posters said, just when you think he can't sink any lower, he does!
You'd think Jack A-Hole would figure out how his minions REALLY think of him when they haul him to that dentist!
After beating the crap out of the guy who beat the crap out of him, he goes back to the SAME DENTIST when he should be hauling the clown into court for making him look like Tom Cruise's retarded cousin!
I don't want to bag on Ben - he's actually good when used correctly = I blame the script and direction that left him standing around with egg on his face (and on his Armani suit).
Sure, every man's life is suddenly ameliorated when a supermodel lands in his lap.
And if there is no feelings developed for any of the characters, there is no drama when something happen to them.
He seemed very uncomfortable--almost to the point of hostility--that there was some small contingent of the gay community that might find him desirable, and that doesn't go over so well when you're playing a gay man on a gay-themed comedy.
Since when does the army(of any country)take the time to have each soldier laboriously sponge bath one another?
Why, when a soldier comes into the barracks drunk and late while everybody is asleep, does he pee on another guys face?
For instance the time when the soldiers were all standing in a group.
Then when the camera got the end it started panning back in the other direction.
I thought it funny that the doc didn't seem to think it was a big deal when one rat he injected with a serum killed all the other rats!
There is only one mild shock, when an old lady patient suddenly lunges at a nurse.
I thought it was a masterful depiction of what would probably actually happen when someone you loved just disappeared out of the blue, and the turmoil of emotions that would be unleashed.
I remember bullying my then-boyfriend (now husband, in spite of my demonstrably bad taste in movies by wanting to even SEE this) to go see this in '76 when it first came out.
I remember Playboy magazine had a spread with Misty Rowe when this film was made.
All his claims were never proved as a matter of fact his marriage claim was totally disproven when a check dated at the same time of their wedding and signed by Miss Monroe proved that she was in Los Angeles at the time.
Two things that really stuck in my mind is the theme song, a soft rock/folk rock tune that went "Norma Jean wants to be a movie queen" and the other thing is when she finally gets her big break she utters the immortal words "I never have to perform fellatio again", except in a more graphic term.
and later when Fisby offers to learn the language, Purdy replies "No need; we won the war!"
One-joke material about cultural assimilation isn't exactly politically-correct when seen today, but were these stale, frantic jokes ever amusing?
A pleasant holiday excursion goes horribly wrong when a man's lady friend goes missing at a crowded rest stop.
Of course, keep a few handy responses in mind should you watch this with your better half when they ask the inevitable, almost rhetorical question, "What would you do if I went missing and you couldn't find me?"
Take the scene many bring up in "Pat Garrett's" favor, when Slim Pickens and Katy Jurado face mortality on a riverbank to the strains of Dylan's "Knockin' On Heaven's Door".
"Comes an age in a man's life when he doesn't want to spend time thinking' about what comes next," he says, a contrast from the forever-young come-what-may Billy.
Regardless, when 37-year-old Kris Kristofferson appears on screen as the 21-year-old "kid," reality takes flight.
Six friends fly off for a camping trip, but when their seaplane suffers engine trouble, they are forced to land on the beach of a remote island.
Pa nearly has a heart attack when Lynn (Fiona Hutchinson) lights a cigarette at the dinner table, and Ma is very disappointed in Cynthia (Sarah Torgov) when she fails to clean her plate.
I felt Saskia's fright when she thought she lost Rex initially, and her description of her dream made me feel chills.
A particularly powerful moment was when he slammed the car door shut so hard the window crumbled into pieces.
I found the professor's description of his actions appalling in many cases, the most notable one being when he fixates on Saskia and we see his POV.
Rex undergoes one of the most harrowing emotional ordeals of any movie character ever, and when he is at the end of his rope his crucial decision would seem so insane out of context but viewers understand that it really is his only choice.
One was Psycho, which I saw 10 years ago when I was only 12.
This isn't great film-making, but when you're a horror fan, you can take anything and usually find the good in it.
Their plane is giving them trouble when on a trip so they land it near an island.
They just barge into an obviously occupied home on an island to ask for help but when they see no ones home they play a record and start dancing around like losers.
First of all Maria Conchita Alonso is a famous for just being famous, but she is NOT a good actress or worst yet she is not an actress And I don't get Kuno Becker I never liked him when he used to do telenovelas and I don't like him now, he's not handsome or talented or nothing at all.
I saw this movie two days ago,In hope to show an investor, examples of independent films thank god I had Napeleon Dynamite on hand,a true sample of what an ultra low budget should look like.I can be a forgiving viewer when it comes to independent films.I've watched my share of garbage-amateur-horrible-z-grade horror, but Leigh Slawner's: The Beast of Bray Road Flats must be the worst ever!
The only positive thing about this movie was the ending credits and when I tab open on my DVD player.
First I was actually offended that they're showing the town it took place in as wide spot in the road where all the woman have to do is whore themselves out, the men beat the women and work of cars, that is when they're not at the bar.
It was cool when Spielberg did it in Jaws, but now every talentless director thinks it'll give his film suspense, but it's just irritating.
)Also of note are the episodes when Pastorelli has a heart attack (or rather his Fritz does), which is not in the U.K. series, the U.S. version of Fritz talking to his dad, and the final episode where Robbie Coltrane stars as a Hollywood star.
You know that when a horror film is turned into "Roadhouse" for an instance just to keep the story going, it becomes painfully clear that you're not watching anything resembling entertainment.
Even when The Asylum isn't ripping off another movie, they still suck.
I love horror movies and when this came out I was determined to watch it because I live only 40 minutes down the I system from Bray Road.
True, the video was pretty clear, but surely a real scientist (even a cryptozoologist) would have been more skeptical than to use the old Sherlock Holmes line "when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever's left ... etc.
I first saw this movie visiting my uncle in Florida for the summer when I was 10 years old.
In a major climactic battle, when Misquamacas calls on the main Satanic demon to assist him, Erskine's love will help the computers' manitou spirits(!)
Especially when it has a pitch as insane as The Manitou, which sees Susan Strasberg growing the foetus of a 400-year-old reincarnated Native American medicine man in her neck and calling on Tony Curtis' psychic for help.
This message is made very clear when an old lady starts yelling, floating 6 inches off the ground, and throws herself down a flight of stairs, completely taking out the railing.
My favorite part is when the nurse's head flies across the room.
My favorite line is when after an entire movie about this medicine man, John Singing Rock goes "He got away!"
For starters, I was eighteen in 1978 when THE MANITOU was released.
Like when a surgeon is forced to carve up his own hand with a scalpel.
In classic fashion, if you can still find Graham Masterton's novel (which made the best-seller lists back then), when you read it you'll discover that what was great in print didn't necessarily come across that way on the big screen.
So, not that I don't think the guy has talent, but it's kind of hard to take him seriously as a Native American medicine man, because when I look at him, all I can see is the Klingon General Kang, whom he played in the STAR TREK: TOS episode "Day Of The Dove."
Keeping in mind that this was made in the technologically challenged late 70's, one of my favorite lines was when Tony Curtis' character asks the hospital administrator about how much computer equipment is available that might be used to kill the evil spirit.
I was a huge fan of this series when it first aired.
Meredith refers Curtis to a present day Medicine Man (Ansara) who is reluctant to help out a paleface woman, but does anyway when he realizes the severity of the incident.
Unfortunately for everyone, she's had so many X-rays to find out what's wrong that when he comes out, he's dwarfed and deformed, though still quite powerful (as demonstrated by his stripping the skin off a live human male and freezing the entire floor of a hospital, one hapless nurse right along with it!)
), surgeon Cedar being forced to cut himself with his own scalpel by the unborn ancient hobgoblin, a nod to the 70's disaster cycle in which a hospital office shakes and rattles as if it were unused footage from "Earthquake" and the heinous space effects when Strasberg's room becomes an inter-dimensional playground (complete with her doffing her hospital gown and taking on the creature TOPLESS!)
Mr. Manitou is one heck of an ugly character and like I said when I was little he was enough to make me pull my blanket over my eyes.
The greasy little monster that crawls out of Susan Strasberg's back is a powerful shrimp (shrunken and disfigured because of the multiple X-Rays done when trying to figure out what was going on with this goiter gone bad).
I remember it being one of the best shows of the season when it was released.
The show has a great deal more depth than much of what's on, plus a large dose of simple everyday realism compared with most current dramas (where's Bochco when he's needed?)
Wow!I am quite disappointed that this could not compete with his recent sh*t called 'Kaalai'(The Bull-It was even more pathetic) Vallavan-has no story,screenplay and direction.It only has a good original score by Yuvan Shankar Raja.If he hadn't been there,the movie would have fallen flat.Even when he is there the movie still falls flat.
This is a very early Our Gang comedy, yet oddly when the film begins it says it stars James Finlayson and Charley Chase.
There's one very unpleasant gag sequence early on, when the kids harvest fleas from the beard of a sleeping man, accidentally setting him on fire when their magnifying lens works as a burning-glass.
I couldn't help being reminded of real-life occasions when juvenile delinquents have deliberately set fire to a tramp or homeless person as a 'joke'.
In this movie, when the burning man jumps off a quay into the water, the scene is shot in a manner that emphasises the danger he's in, rather than playing for comedy.
The black kid's dog shakes some fleas around the musicians, and when the black kid is picked up crawling around by his legs, he manages to drop the jar filled with all the kids' caught fleas.
"Uncle" finally gets a retrieve, when he develops a notion of parenting.
Jack Lemmon is capable of brilliant work but he can be lousy when he goes too far over the top with slapstick humor (loved that chicken suit, Jack) and I defy anyone who doesn't need serious help to watch the last scene without groaning audibly and reaching for a barf bag.
At the conclusion, when Lemmon smooched his "son" full on the mouth and then dropped his pants, the reaction shots (especially hers) were just plain sick.
i thought this show was awful cause new york didn't win and she was the one who went back for flavor the second time when she could of had someone else her mom was right she was the only one who really loved flavor not that dumb face ugly girl he chose gross what a fat hag gross new york is way hotter and sexier she is way more than the other girl flavor you made a bad choice you just better hope new yorks mom don't come after you but i hope she does just playing but why didn't you pick new york she is all you need telling you the truth she really loved you and you made her go home again after again sad but i guess thats you and whats up with the grills at the end i think its cute but i still think new york should of been wearing them
In a time when reality shows are "the thing" and most everyone is cute and pretty on these dating shows, it is refreshing to see a show where someone who isn't cute or pretty...but has a lot of money is looking for someone to love.
This movie is an average, watchable and very forgettable story when you have nothing wiser to do.
Zal was disappointing (so promising actress in her early movies like Testament or Amelia, I hoped she'll become something like Mare Winningham, but this movie maybe didn't give her enough opportunity), Perry was better in flashback scenes and quite inconceivable when dealing with her wife's death and being a suspect for her murder, Greene had too small part and I wonder how low can she fall, while Benzali was the only reason one could enjoy in this movie.
This movie is definitely a good example of what happens when you let those things take place.
Halfway through, the episode completely shifts gears and turns into a vampire story, and gets even more ridiculous when the revelation is made about who the head vampire is.
However, the downfall of the movie comes when the first laughably ridiculous decision is made: when a terrible thing occurs in front of one of the main characters, he just turns around and stands there thinking about what to do.
Drake is plain stupid, and Megan just doesn't know when to quit.
Drake, Josh, and Miranda are all horrible actors, and most of the guest stars are useless when it comes to acting.
this movie as most other recent HK martial arts movies (with young unexperienced actors when it comes to chinese kung fu movies) is too dependent on CGI, what's the point in watching a movie filled with CGI's???
As someone that was born and raised in New Jersey, a huge Howard Stern fan (back when it was free, that is), and a fan of both baseball movies and R-rated comedies, I had high hopes for this movie.
Boy, was I off when I finally got to see this thing!
It's a shame because some of biggest laughs I ever had in my life came from listening to the Howard Stern radio show which Artie helped tremendously when he was added to the show, but the comedy involved in Howard's show wasn't stale one-liners that fell flat.
Mark Burnett's other show, "Survivor" also raised questions for me when Johnny Fairplay stages his departure when he clearly had just a short time before his child is to be born.
What were they thinking when they accepted this script to be made into a movie?
What were they thinking when they agreed to act in this movie?
What was I thinking when I rented this movie?
I saw this movie when it came out in theaters last year, not by choice, by force!
For too long the movie basically lies still when it isn't heading toward one clear direction and the characters and situations aren't interesting and strong enough to keep your interest.
You know something is very wrong with a comedy when the highlight of the movie is a extended cameo from a well known comedy actor.
VIEW FROM THE TOP is not particularly offensive but a considerable disappointment considering the talent involved,and La Paltrow's career since her Oscar nearly a decade back has not really developed as it should've done,not surprising when she takes on roles as trivial as this.Maybe she's being punished for that notorious acceptance speech..........
Even the likable Mark Ruffalo came off poorly when confronted with the terrible direction and revolting writing that backed this travesty.
The nadir occurs when Appelgate and Paltrow fight in the galley of an otherwise empty plane, spilling peanuts and drink carts along the way.
Maybe that sounds amusing, but when you see the actresses looking for things to knock over you know you are in the midst of a bad dream.
The nadir occurs when several of the students, including our heroine, first go to Sally Westin's (Bergen) house for dinner and we are subjected to a stream of jokes surrounding the homosexuality of Randy Jones (Josh Molina) that are at best unfunny and at worst offensively homophobic.
This movie gave me that same sinking feeling I got when watching "Cellular".
of the school (And understandably, the police would never search the school where she was last seen, and of course the school wouldn't start to smell when Mary's body rotted inside that chest, so it remains unsolved for 30 years).
Only when they order their own deaths as a joke do they realise this is all actually happening in real life.
This is the only one good part in the movie - That part is when spiders come out girl face was really good it is bit over the top scene but the Rest of the movie is garbage 3/10 just for that scene
I love Urban Legends quite simply because it is from the Scream era when all teen slash horrors were worth watching, even the rubbish ones.
(MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD IF YOU CARE) Hell, Kate Mara's character is hardly even phased when a character is revealed to have killed her brother (END).
I have to say I saw this film when I was 14-15 and I found it amusing.
second thing is i just can't believe what they did when they handled this flick in the post production: at some points, the scenes are completely out of order so again the story lacks!
the foxy-woman, and turned this movie into a documentation about what happens/what you see when you get hold on some really good shoot (your comment contains prohibited words!)
I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this movie when it came out, but my first warning should have been when it went straight to video and not in theatres like its former installments.
Seriously, I felt when she came on screen she was the fairy good witch, not scary at all.
The only slightly decent part of this film is the makeup done on Mary Banner herself when she's attacking people.
Mary Banner(Lilith Fields)is a victim of accident when a prank by a certain jock in particular goes awry.
Chasing after her, the jock tries to grab her when Mary bites his hand.
The ending when Mary finally meets the one responsible for her suffering is embarrassingly awful.
I have heard that they cut out the part when they run into each other at the hospital.
The film has nothing to do with the actual legend of Bloody Mary or what she supposedly does when summoned.
You can immediately sense how lame this movie will be from the very beginning when the model is showering nude (why are people always so happy when they shower in the movies?)
in full make-up or when Yaphet Koto is being shot at in his helicopter by ground terrorists, and doesn't seem the least bit bothered by the fuselage of gunfire.
Yes, she should have had the final call but when have the Scoobies attacked the Big Bad without proper preparation and evaluation of the options?
I thought thought we'd be seeing a bio-pic on Monica Lewinsky I seriously did but instead found myself watching a black comedy road movie   This is a co-production between the BBC and the Irish film council made at the same time when British film production was picking up thanks to TRAINSPOTTING and THE FULL MONTY .
You'll know them when you see them I'm sure   Having said that I WENT DOWN is a lot better than many other movies that were funded by public bodies in the British Isles round about the same time .
Footage from Cyborg Cop 3 (1996), Cyborg Cop (1993), Project Shadowchaser 4 (1996), Warhead (1996) and Never Day Die (1994) was used for almost ALL action scenes, except for those when we see Pare running / shooting or talking.
He has blocked out the memory all of his life, but when a series of events triggers him to remember his dark past, he must get vengeance for his family.
I stress online because when was the internet ever like what it is in this movie?
I saw this when it came on TV once, all i knew about this movie before I watched it, was that it had something to do with a werewolf.
Why are we researching Hydrogen power when there are ideas like this?
The acting is monotone for almost the entire production, even when a zombie is disemboweling some unfortunate victim and even then you can't even rely on the violence to carry this one.
***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***** The good news for this film is that I have seen worse....Children of the Dead always come to mind when trying to pinpoint the worst in the genre.
One of the most laughable parts of the movie was when they were held up in an abandoned building.
Huh, no one seemed to notice this when they let him in.
It almost reminds me of the horrible editing in the early silent movies when film was so expensive you had to take the shot you got and often the cuts didn't match.
The only real instance we are 'some-what' presented with a feel is when a still shot of the school/warehouse/prison/business building is darkened using Photoshop for night and re-lit for day)a virus has changed FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE!!
And that is the feeling you get when you watch this; that it's some high-school student film project which got misplaced and by some horrible freak accident wound up on the shelves of the video store.
The pinnacle of the awfulness was the scene at the stairs when the zombies broke through the "barricade."
I almost took the DVD out and broke it in half when, about 10 seconds later, pitchfork guy requests a bullet to the head before having even been touched by a zombie.
They're so poorly delivered I actually cringed a few times (when I wasn't laughing and rolling my eyes).
I was glad when it was over.
In one scene a couple is listening to the radio on their car stereo and when the girl reaches to turn it up... the scene cuts to live news broadcasts on a television highlighting the zombie uprising before cutting back to the pair in the car discussing the "magical" TV broadcasts?
A cheesy movie is acceptable when done right - this wasn't.
But when it comes to bad horror movies, it is nothing more than a poor attempt at getting guys to pick this crap off the shelves and say "Hey dude, let's get this one!
The acting is bad most of the times, and even when the acting in the first one was no Oscar-worthy, John Franklin's Isaac is in many ways superior to Ryan Bollsman's Micah as the leader of the cult.
Specially when compared to the first one.
The film is not quite without merit but when the credits roll there is a strong feeling of what was the point, and "He who walks behind the rows" is mentioned so many times I wanted to throw the DVD case at the screen.
The only 2 good scenes were when the character Micah is possessed, he gets zapped and then he's falling through a strange shaft, gets his body dismantled, he who walks behind the rows enters his blood, and he gets pieced to together and falls out into the cornfield.
How on earth can some fly directly sideways (staying in their wheelchair the entire time) when being hit straight on?
Of course this film is corny because it is all about corn Thought that there were only one or two good scenes for example micah (bollman) is in Church and has a wooden doll and knife there is someone sitting across from him then micah starts putting the knife up the doll's nose and the guy across from him nose starts to bleed then micah keeps on doing it until the guy dies and the other good part is when micah dies.
Now that is quite original, and when I was first told of this by my Cousin I pictured it vividly.
This film does have its good scenes, mainly when Danny is arguing with his dad, the teenage wit and angry demanding parent though stereotypical is realistic and at least gives the movie some sense of reality before it generates into the monomania of your average American teen horrorfest.
Focusing on the new inmate, Solitaire (Carla Greene), a tough girl who Shadow was planning to sacrifice when she was a baby, it isn't long before the zombies of the prisoners led by Shadow himself are out to finish what he started.
I'm not one to trash other people's movies, but I make an exception when they waste an hour and a quarter of my time and return NOTHING.
Despite a preponderance of exposed breasts, it's very like the first film, all innocent fun, the sex is at the level of a geeky teenager, which I was when I saw this, so it suited me fine.
However, when HALF THE SCREEN IS MISSING IT'S HARD TO APPRECIATE THE HUMOR!
There's the irony of two men of the cloth talking about the soul building merit of sport, as they pass a bloody-faced 'sport' being hammered into a boxing ring turnbuckle, BUT that's all lost when you don't see the bloody-faced 'sport'.
There's the maid in the house forever hovering like some dark force of unrequited passion, together with the swish-swish of her dress, BUT that's all lost when you RARELY see the maid, and you certainly don't see the expressions on her face when the action is allegedly on the other characters in the scene.
The dialogue is silly: when a conspirator tries to suck up to Sheba, he says "You and I have much more in common than you may realise; you are very beautiful".
Sheba even gets to lead her own horse to water when they reach an oasis: I suppose the budget didn't stretch to servants and other such inessential items.
But I can't pretend I tried to follow the storyline, as I kept missing bits when they spoke too softly while I was laughing.
I'm not sure when I'll be able to keep food down again.
There are brief glimpses of Argento's class, the nicely lit blue tones as Mel is killed, or the sequence when Argento's camera pans across the floor for what seems like an eternity with lots of people walking past to come to rest on the killers & their victims feet by which a few seconds later her decapitated head lands but these scenes are few & far between as although technically Non Ho Sonno is good it's all pretty bland & forgettable for most of it's duration.
However, when Clark is eventually caught (and rightfully so--she is after all a thief), she vows to destroy a man who worked for a department store that insisted she be prosecuted (Ralph Bellamy).
The worst is a bit later when Clark is caught committing another crime and Bellamy could have just let the police take her away--yet he vouches for her and prevents her arrest!!
That's one of the basics you learn when you are being taught how to create/design something.
Swamp Zombies by director and star Len Fabianksi is the story of a doctor who is trying to bring the dead back to life, but when federal agents come to inspect the hospital he is working in he must ditch the cadavers quick.
You mention that the scene where the old man runs screaming through the trees is supposed to be funny, well i didn't know that when watching because that guys acting skills made me believe that was his best attempt at being terrified.
I didn't pay to watch this film, which i am glad i didn't and when i can get the directors second film 'curse of the wolf' for free i will watch that too, out of pure curiosity as the director mentions that it is a much better film which shows that he has advanced as a film maker.
Maybe you should hang up your film makers hat Mr Fabinaksi, your first two ideas for films have been zombies and werewolves, so your hardly original, you have 0 talent when deciding what angles to use and you cant write a script.
No-one puts any effort into anything & they just sort of either stand there or jog depending on the scene, the scene when the old man is first attacked by the zombies & runs through the wood waving his arms in the air letting out a little wailing noise is hilarious & the bit when a fat redneck guy comes face-to-face with a zombie & he says 'oh my god' like he was asking someone to change the channel on the TV.
Swamp Zombies is possibly the worst film I've ever seen, I'm sure no-one sets out to make a bad film but when it's this bad & we have to spend our hard earned money & time watching it it's difficult to cut it any slack or have any sympathy for the filmmakers.
This was, I felt, a very touching story about a man who chooses to stay with his wife even after a miscarriage (when the whole reason for the marriage was the pregnancy).
And when Ms Sen puts her relationship with her soon to be husband on the line and tells lies to the police to save her boss, Anil Kapoor, who would think something like this can actually occur in real life.
Well, can't really blame these producers when the rest of the bollywood producers are also doing the same except a few who I will list later.
I guess when they put part 2 on a movie it usually is bad.
Chuck Norris looks bored replaying his role in the first film (Col. McCoy) for vengeance when his pal's wife was killed by a merciless drug dealer named Ramon Cotta (played with surprising menace by THE UNTOUCHABLES' Billy Drago), who has been freed numerous times after being captured.
It was so funny that I haven't ever laughed as much as when I saw it for the first time.
Also, It used to be scary for me when I was young.
Pretty uneventful slasher film about a cheer-leader try-out competition at Camp Hurrah becoming a tad sour when someone starts knocking of the cheerleaders.
Further confusing matters is the fact that all these pretty young cheerleaders look about the same, so once the bodies start dropping it's easy to stop caring who gets it and when.
Now, as for the movie, this was a surprisingly good slasher film, especially seeing as it came out in the late 80's when they were all becoming parodies of themselves.
In case you're not up on your trivia, Leif was Brooke Shield's first boyfriend when she was a 13-year old sex symbol (although it was Dean Cain that got to break her in at Princeton).
Rounding out the casting coup are two Playboy Playmates, which is always good for the trivia buff, especially when one of them is Terry Weigel, the only playmate I know of who went on to make hardcore porn.
However, some intense close-ups of the insects are unnecessary and drag the film down a bit as "The Birds", "Jaws," and any other frightening thriller involving nature is the more frightening when you can't really see the terror.
Boring, underdirected, overplayed, overdramatized, inconsistent -- these are just a few words that come to mind when watching this garbage.
John Saxon adds what little life there is to this as a rival to Janssen but when he left, the picture became a boring slog.
), and watered-down action (when there was any action!).
To finish this off i promise i was trying hard to think something nice to say about the movie but it happens to be so long and so slow, that when you get to an action scene or to an important part of the story you are so bored from what happened before that they go unappreciated.
The statue itself looked very weird and creepy and I liked it when the camera zoomed up towards its eyes.
(There are Spoilers) Having been into the Black Arts all his adult life London antiques dealer Neal Mottram, Jack Palance, secretly has monthly, when there's a full moon, jam sessions with his coven of witches.
Ronnie when he finds out about his boss' dirty deeds comes apart and starts to hit the bar scene drinking himself almost to the point of passing out.
It's even worse when you try to do the same movie again in the US.  
But these minor details shouldn't matter, should they, when we watch "Bread and Roses"?
The demonstrators, when asked for their names by the police, give the names of Mexican revolutionary figures, and we are supposed to laugh at the stupidity of the American policemen.
I also choked on my drink when a certain person died from being bitten a couple times.. sheesh, I survived bike accidents with more wounds than he had!
I was more than a little shocked when i saw the high ratings on this movie.
This actually makes the characters seem completely different when they are speaking English vs. Italian.
The dialogue is infantile, the plot ridiculous ( why would Jimmy get 4 other crazy thugs, and split the $50,000., when he do it himself, or just hire one or two of the crazies for a couple of grand?
I expect blood and guts when I watch these movies, which there is very little of here.
The epitomic moment of this film is when Critical Bill insists on playing a cop and Jimmy caves in and lets him do so with the insurance that he's not allowed to open his mouth.
Rover accidentally ruins an illegal deal being done by Connie's mean boyfriend Rocky, so when Connie leaves for a couple weeks, Rocky disposes of the dog, and Rover ends up on a farm.
They say that when you put together a film in which the characters are the story, you best have good actors behind them.
And when your cast includes the men who played Bishop or Lex Luthor, it is hard to blame the problem on the actors.
The final moment when Harmonica's flashback is completed in Once Upon A Time In The West is such a gob-smacker in its original form that smart directors know not to try and ape because it was more than just a means to an end.
During the entire film, The Kid is only a whiny brat who starts to bawl when things do not entirely go his way.
This partly leads me to believe others may be right when they say that The Quick And The Dead needed another hour of footage (or script) in order to accomplish its goals.
And when one remembers that this film was put together by the same man who gave us such a haunting, creepy atmosphere in The Evil Dead, or such a horrifyingly real tragic hero in Darkman, it makes The Quick And The Dead such a bitter pill to swallow.
What do you get when you throw a 13-year-old girl and a fifty something old lady in a room together and tell them to churn out a script?
This garbage heap of silver screen melodrama tells the story of a 13 year old girl named Tracy who, over the course of what seems like a week, is turned into a drug-using, self-mutilating hussy when she befriends a "popular girl" named Evie (is it just me or is there too much business over who's "popular" and who's not in films about adolescence?).
Tell me, when was the last time someone won an Oscar for acting stupid and clueless?
Especially when it's a bad move like when he teaches his girlfriend to defend herself from being choked.
Heavy stuff, always trying to explain the world to us, and/or trying to educate the audience when it is not called for.
The Free Will was not in itself awful, but there were so few points of interest that I found myself becoming restless within forty minutes, and when the credits rolled in what will doubtless be considered a brilliantly emotional finale, I still felt little attachment to the characters.
This movie is the best example for what happens, when someone does not focus on the script while making a movie.
On the contrary when Theo breaks into a woman's apartment to rape her we see him leave, but we have no idea whether his demons got the upper hand or not.
So there is sadistic curiosity when someone is raped, but when the free will has it's short time, it's too much to just state the fact and the audience is left in the dark.
it is sad when Jason is the barometer of good quality.
They should have known when you use a sentence like "give me your suffering" that you should give people real suffering.
The teenager Madison McBride (Sarah Roemer) is traumatized by the loss of her deranged father when she was nine yearÂold and the suicide of her beloved brother Brandon one year ago.
I wasn't expecting anything when I saw this movie for free.
I found it hysterical at first because it seemed almost natural the way it was spoken, but then it becomes totally repetitive and soon falls apart when the killer finally shows up.
And when I say falls apart, I mean it for all the characters.
I payed attention enough to want to strangle nearly every character in the scenes when they aren't dancing.
Xena, where are you when we need you?
It's kinda funny, when you think about it.
But that's not good when we're supposed to be enjoying the locusts.
Probably the dumbest scene in the whole movie is when they're in the helicopter and Lawless starts trying to kill everybody.
But when a friend of their's, Luther is running late for their meeting.
Buck is unaware of what is to happen when his friends take him to the bank and he finds out that maybe he'd rather just go to jail then be with these blood suckers.
And when I learned that there will be one prequel and one sequel, I was very happy.
But when I watched the movie this Saturday, I was totally disappointed, I mean, this is the most meaningless, plotless and unnecessary sequel I ever seen.
The major one is when LUTHER goes to the "Titty Twister" Bar and becomes a vampire, but even that one was terribly short and spoiled.
It isnt too hard to mistake them when the people who released this movie retitled it and put some pictures from these movies on the cover.
For example when she's leaving Chevalier's apartment, and she's leaving the key.
Her facial expressions are way too pathetic and remind me of the silent movies, when everything had to be over the top to convey the meaning.
Still I can't quite figure out how it's possible to get lost in a forest near Frederica when driving from Copenhagen to Barcalona?
It hurt the film when the lady that first played the Grandma was used to play the mother and the young woman used to play the daughter played her own daughter.
I was coming down from a hangover state when I saw this movie ... and it still couldn't satisfy me.
I was excited when looking on this site I saw that there was a movie made based on the books by Persia Woolley, I have been a fan for a long time.
In an era when the work of Freud has been greatly discredited this movie seems compelled to propagate the stereotypical image of a psychiatrist as one who worships at the feet of the master, having busts of him in his office and in his vacation home, and even naming his children Sigmund and Anna.
It rambled all over, and when everyone came together I could tell it would get worse.
I was seriously annoyed when I saw that idiot US Paratrooper officer (played by Michael Madsen).
The other day i watched the war film Sophie Scholl - and even though it didn't have half the 'big' name actors in it and was foreign produced and acted it was the most brilliant film I have seen for awhile and the fact that stupid stupid films such as the last drop (more like the last war film for these film makers) are made, do not do justice to the real stories and real suffering that the occupied countries went through when the Third Reich was in power.
It was guffaw time for me when he walked into Command Central and was introduced as a leader in some sort of scientific field.
The countryside and settings look very little like Holland...its almost an insult to our intelligence and sad when you realise that it wouldn't have taken a great deal to get it right.
I had to admit i had my reservations when i saw that Michael Madsen had a cameo role, that usually consists of him strolling around just thinking of collecting his paycheck and as for introducing David Ginola !!!!
I turned it of when the SS officer in full uniform runs through a British platoon to get to a truck and gets away with it just after he says to his side kick we will use the artillery as cover, because artillery good for that.
I am a big fan of WWII films, so when I saw this one at Blockbuster I picked it up.
I can't really comment on the quality of the acting, because I think it is impossible for an actor to turn in a good performance when he/she is given nothing to work with.
What I liked is that many characters were not black & white - something that reflects true wartime conditions when the very best & worst in men & women comes out.
The directorial choices vary from very fine (mixing black and white grainy shots from war footage with stagy though competent settings in color) to questionable (allowing a musical score including steel guitar music and contemporary sounds to intrude into a time when such instrumentation was not even known) to mediocre (allowing the actors to be caricatures instead of players in a tense drama).
You know when you pass by a car wreck and you know that it's something bad, but you just have to look at it.
The only reason that I'm giving it a four is because the Locusts actually look really good when grouped up and close-ups are real Locusts.
Who ever did the music hadn't a clue, especially when Mr Madsen appears and its some sleazy late night bar jazz music going on and as for the lame rock music in parts..well not exactly on a 1940's theme are they.
They made Emilio the center of the story when, the bond between Mark and Bryon was supposed to be the center.
Morgan Freeman has a good act for Charlie Woods,but in the scene when Charlie comes out with his shotgun, honestly your suppose to be in the scared moment,but the way he walks in with the shotgun makes you laugh.
When Bryon visits Mark in jail, Mark tells him the only reason he wanted to see him is to make sure he hated him and that when he gets out of jail he will never go home.
Especially when compared to the vast sea of other made-for-TV-movies, it stands out ahead of the pack.
The film-makers prove themselves incompetent when her bad-girl character is killed off towards the end.
Those much parodied big-band Bond themes sound a lot better, too, when compared to the irritating sub-surf-pop theme that opens the film.
But the locker room type humor that typifies the Matt Helm series was definitely wearing thin when The Ambushers came out.
Something in the atmosphere when the switch is thrown kills all members of the male species.
Well at least we know that the hormonal kinks must have been worked out before July of 1969 when Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins went to the moon
The characters are uninspired, the sets are run of the mill, and the killings are non-existent (despite one okay moment when Tunneler drilled a guy in the crotch.
Worst of all, the puppets hardly ever make an appearance, and when they do they are obviously being held up by just-out-of-the-frame stage hands.
what I don't understand is why is he carving a humanoid body, when he ends up as a TANK!?!?
Tank spends the whole movie carving this puppet out of wood, when he is transferred into it, there's a TV screen?
Honestly, I have no idea what Gregory Peck was thinking when he decided to make this incredibly awful movie.
Catch the sequel, #7, when it comes out, I guess.
cutting short what should have been a romantic interlude with her chiseled-torsoed boyfriend (played by the wooden Dylan Neal), who whines like a child about how her prestigious Washington position takes her from his bed; the school bus scene when the daughter of the locusts' breeder calls for her daddy; the meeting with the USDA and the Dept.
of Homeland Security, in which Lawless briefs a panel wearing full dress uniforms while she is dressed in skin-tight jeans; the inevitable expression of remorse from the entomologist, prior to his bloody demise; the scene in the Pittsburgh office, with the b-day party being interrupted by a picture window full of bugs (plus the revelation that the office hunk is even wimpier than Lawless' bf); the scene in the chopper when Lawless declares she's hormonal due to her pregnancy, and just might kill everyone in the chopper if the DHS doesn't change its drastic plan; the climactic kiss that is interrupted by the buzzing of the swarm; and just about every scene in which people are warned about the locusts' pending arrival -- first, they're in denial; minutes later, they're running for their lives.
The only time I smiled was when the end credits starting to scroll up the TV screen - that was a happy moment.
This was just a poor ripoff at a time when poor ripoffs weren't as common as now.
Clark seemed pretty harmless, but I was waiting for an exciting moment at the end of the movie when he revealed his true, merciless character (The Gunslinger)!
So when I saw the ninjas magically appear fully clothed and with weapons, I was thinking, "Since when do mechanical robots and their trappings materialize from nothing?"
Then, when we find out that these new insidious creations are flesh-and-blood, that still left me thinking, "How on earth would you create a human clone from thin air?"
I like a lot of movies so when I started to watch this I figured it couldn't be worse then something like Crossroads.
The plot was hard to follow, and when I did figure out what was going on I didn't feel any better.
Right... my original interaction with this movie was last May (2005) when I was given a CD of various Broadway songs... one of them being the revival (1998) version of the song "Cabaret," from "Cabaret" of course...
So when a production of the show came to my city this last month, I was eager to see such.
Regarding Elizabeth Hurley, let me just first say that when I first heard that Tomb Raider was going to be made into a movie, Hurley was the ONLY actress I saw playing the role, since, a) she looks exactly LIKE Lara Croft AND b) she's ALREADY English!
Anybody who wants to know what really happened that fateful night in 1873 when two Norwegian women were murdered on an island off the coast of New Hampshire won't find out by watching this movie.
Between dreadfully dull scenes of chinwagging between Agren and Warbeck, as they attempt to discover who or what is responsible for a spate of recent murders, viewers are treated to a touch of light gore, plus some nudity courtesy of Agren's busty fashion model sister (who displays very unusual techniques when it comes to both modelling and taking a shower).
JAANEMANN.... 1 Leave your mind at home when you go to watch this film 2 direction is great in the beginning (as it apes musicals such as Chicago and moulin rouge) but fails miserably towards the end 3 Screenplay starts off well, then falls apart.
The only suspenseful thing about this movie was wondering how much longer it could go on, how much more hideous torture we would be subjected to, and when the totally predictable ending would finally arrive.
I am being honest here when I say that I gave the movie a chance.
Makes your skin crawl when you see it.
The clues are loosely presented to represent The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and what will happen to mankind when the veil is lifted.
Also, when the cops go to the store where they bought them, the owner of the store says he's only sold 4 of them to a bunch of teenagers.
Alex: I knew he was one of the Horsemen right when I first saw him act shy, blame his father for not being there for his mother when she was dying of cancer, taking care of Sean while his father is busy working, etc.
The Ending: At the end when Aidan comes home after his son dies, he wakes up Sean and Sean asks where Alex is.
That was all lost in an instant when Ziyi Zhang's character suddenly revealed herself for "what she was" - in the process suddenly going from normal middle class immigrant girl to ludicrous, evil, wry, hissing, (awkwardly) seductive, bloken engrish Oriental villainess.
Still, when Minnelli sang, the movie was fantastic and Joel Grey was slimy and scary as the M.C.
In it's first scenes I thought the movie was promising, and it kept me going for like 20 minutes, without complaining, but when the plot begins to twist, I began to think that it was not worth watching, and then that it's one of the worst movies of the year.
Like I said, the beginning was promising, but the plot twists are so unbelievable and dumb, that when the final twist came, I could not believe that I wasted two hours of my life watching the worst serial killer movie I had ever seeing, when I could be watching "The Silence Of The Lambs" again.
Unfortunately, when it's revealed (well fully, all the clues are spewed from minute one) why the bad things are happening, it's so off-center and contradictory (There are no four horsemen!
And when the four horsemen comeÂwhat?)
Tensions mount at the big party and MJ's self-destructive personality causes the friends to break up when the party ends including a couple that just got engaged during the party.
There are some uncomfortable scenes such as when Bullock's 16 year old brother jumps into bed with MJ and says that she will be the one to "deflower" him and then immediately falls asleep.
I think I laughed once during this movie, when someone made a remark about the "Lambada", and even then, I was only laughing because I kind of knew what the lambada was.
I won't tell you who wins, but (***spoiler alert***) the film's amoral heart is revealed when the party house, led by smirking Dean Cameron, choose to cheat in order to compete.
i pride myself in avoiding crap when i go to the movies, i don't watch blockbusters or lame comedies with former SNL comedians, but this movie falls right in there with the worst of the worst.
Especially during an era when films began to be very spectacular and explicit ("The French Connection", "Deliverance", "The Godfather"), a love-story set amidst the rising Nasism seemed like a very bad idea.
Moreover, there's ponderousness in GuÃ©diguian's style and it is particularly true when the film turns to comedy.
For example, it doesn't avoid vulgarity (when Marius shows his bottom in the bar) and doesn't exclude implausibilities either: Jeannette's daughter wants to go to Paris to study journalism.
He is more at ease and convincing when it comes to make a gritty and realistic representation of Marseille.
Clint Howard makes an uncredited appearance & when he goes uncredited you know your in trouble.
It's hard to decide who to blame as well, when they use a director who has no previous comedic directing skills.
Getting even a glimpse of her when she's not the person talking is enough to spoil the movie.
When he's not on screen you can still hear him and when he's on screen but not staring he's always fidgeting.
And what the hell was when he started shaking for no reason in the car?
There is really no good time to watch this movie, with the possible exception of renting it when you're blind and deaf.
One of the few bright spots was the brief chemistry between Tim Curry and Ed Begley Jnr, bringing back fond memories of Tales of the Crypt, when Curry played three members of a family, with Begley playing a salesman.
I was in junior high school when Liza won Best Actress for her tour de force as Sally Bowles Â I was furious because I felt that Diana Ross got robbed.
The premise of this film, a family reunion of the Addams family, is utterly preposterous considering there was a family reunion all the way back in the first Addams Family film, when Uncle Fester had a party thrown in his honour.
A town which is occupied by a sausage-factory which comes to life when the meat-plant workers come in for rest and relaxation and perform the lessons and morality-tales which are learned from safe and unsafe handling of food and objects around different life-forms.
I know that when the film was made, Raul Julia(may he rest in peace) had died, and that Christina Ricci was getting a little too old to play Wednesday; but did they really have to recast everyone else, too?
This one's not the usual gore-fest, there's a cool scene when someone messily melts into ice cream but why did the previous two victims not melt in this way especially the first one who one moment is standing there & the very next he's melted to nothing within a split second?
I mean we have a clown and the kids that tormented him and he comes back when they are adults to exact his revenge.
Then, when the kids eat the ice cream, the parents melt - like ice cream.
It must also be appreciated when a child actor manages to seem evil or cruel, and it must therefore be mentioned that Samuel Patrick Chu does a very good job being a truly sadistic little bastard in a flashback sequence.
There's some sort of unexplained voodoo thing going on with human-shaped Popsicles which causes the adults to melt (like ice cream) when their child bites into it...
I have to say when I first saw this actress I thought she looked truly amazing.
Woody Brown is fairly convincing as the obsessive guy but when he goes crazy he becomes a little less convincing.
He sits down next to her on a tatami when she is alone.
One of the peak experiences of my movie life took place a few years back when the Music Box Theatre in Chicago held a month-long Kurosawa/Tifune festival, playing every film made by the pair.
Here the director apparently wants us to cry and sympathize with our hero, but all I felt was a creepy feeling that one might feel when observing something so utterly false and cheap cheesy that you want to shudder.
I wasted time watching this garbage when I could've just watched something else.
Sometimes it looked like he was giving a decent performance when he was yelling, but I wouldn't be surprised if he was really yelling because he was sorry he got stuck making such a horrible and worthless movie.
The most memorable scene is when a youngster stands up and sings a patriotic song.
There is a random, grotesque kill where Chucky pushes an innocent man onto a conveyor belt, and he is killed when doll eyes are punched into his face.
A person gets killed on screen and there's no tragedy, but yet everyone gets upset and mourns when someone dies in real life.
My favourite is child's play 1 saw the the 1st chuck film when i was 9 and i loved it.
I can't have fun here, not when there are real monsters in the world.
I tell you, she still is as adorable as when she played her role in American Werewolf in London...only older, of course.
Geoffreys plays his role WAY too nerdy and is even lousy when he's killing--and he was so good in "Fright Night" four years earlier!
It was dragging on and on at snails pace punctuated by a series non shocking/exciting moments and when I looked at the clock I couldn't believe it had only been on for 45 minutes.
In an era when good film songs were at a premium, that was inexcusable.
With Englund's first time behind the camera, you would expect something truly unique or at least something close to being even remotely frightening like "A Nightmare on Elm Street" (1984), but when things get interesting "976-EVIL" devolves into typical slasher/possession stuff and thus joins the ranks of so many other "B" horror movies from the 1980s.
Then District Attorney Rainey shows up, showing all the indignation and righteous anger he might display when breaking up a back-alley poker game.
His greatest moment would be when he rehearses the famously bad rhyme from the first film, and this is a pretty embarrassing moment, to say the least.
And since when can a sheriff and detective reveal evidence about a case to their families?
But then again, I didn't exactly have high hopes for this film...after all, how good can a film be when Roger Clinton plays a guy called Mayor Bubba?
Pumpkinhead II: Blood Wings starts in the isolated 'Ferren Woods 1958' where a deformed boy named Tommy (J.P. Manoux) is happily eating his slop that his guardian Miss Osie (Lilyan Chauvin) has left for him when a group of six teenagers come along, capture him, beat him & eventually murder him... Jump forward to the present day & New York City cop Sean Braddock (Andrew Robinson) is returning to his childhood town to become the local Sheriff together with his wife Beth (Caren Kaye) & teenage daughter Jenny (Ami Dolenz), at first things seem perfect but while trying to make friends Jenny becomes involved with Danny (J. Trevor Edmond) & his gang.
It tries to create some atmosphere but it's all so silly & whats with the constant flashing lights when Pumpkinhead appears?
There is one hilarious bit when a dead woman comes back to life & she sits up in bed & all these lights suddenly shine on her & she starts speaking in a daft voice to the local Sheriff who begins to interrogate her!
Jumping back to the black and white beginning (rip off of the technique first used by the Wizard of Oz), I know we watch these movies for blood and gore, but the opening scene when the deformed Tommy is chased down hanged, sliced and diced, then dumped down the old iron mine was truly shocking, I found my mouth hanging open and I am no pansy when it comes to violence, blood and guts.
In fact, I have the same vision-style when I'm drunk...
Surely this must be one of the movies that made a deep impression on Randall Wallace when he was a kid.
Now, that was really a pretty gutsy move on somebody's part since the war was still going on when the movie was released in 1952.
But when your own life is on the line, what do you do?
I was disappointed when I saw this movie in 1954, probably because I was expecting more "ancient Egypt stuff."
Taylor was much better in "Camille" when he but a sprig of a lad, but very sincere.
This is what happens when a void of talent meets a megalomaniac personality.
Honestly, what recourse do we have when we buy/rent a product of such inferior quality?
OH I love it when a writer says "the heck with realism, research, and writing a good script; all I care about are Zoolander-ish shots of me in the lead role."
It is always nice when a movie has a point.
But when it doesn't, the director should take a cue from the Italians and move from set piece to set piece with the greatest of speed.
Back in the '70s, when Jeff Fahey was on One Life to Live, I stepped into an apartment house elevator and there he was.
The man made a good plot for the movie but when it came down to actors and doing it....he was way in over his head.
I didn't even care all that much when the guy dies in the beginning, even though they tell us we should.
It is sad when a film so badly gets so much money and produces such a bad product.
The rest of the movie is filled with drastic over explanation of points the audience throughly comprehends and with 'intelligent dialog' that the majority of viewers actually found intelligent back when they themselves were asking the same questions when they were 9 years old.
First of all, when you slide some title off the shelf that never made it to theatrical release with a cover that features Dennis Hopper staring out at you in all his squinty-eyed, slightly soulful I-Am-a-Raving-Lunatic intensity.
Fun galore on an evening when you've got nothing better to do.
The director needs to take some of the blame for his failure to reign in the actors and the script (although when your lead actor is also the writer and the producer ...).
"Mein Herr," a rare moment in Hollywood History when Minnelli's camera-centric sleazing actually works.
I absolutely loved Highlander part I, but when I saw this movie, I didn't understand the story at all!
Why do our hearts break when her father stands her up after she spent the first half an hour lying about how much he cares for her?
Look at the giddy expression on her face when Max volunteers to "corrupt" her and Brian.
Another sad fact is that when showtunes become standards, they lose almost all of the potency they have IN CONTEXT.
She's lost a good man, friends (I doubt she'll be seeing much of Fritz after the wedding), and in the end her career is in the same spot it was when the movie began.
The songs, all performed in the night club, avoids the suspension of disbelief required for other musicals when characters randomly burst into song on the sidewalk.
"Mein Herr" is sung when sexual tension begins to arise between Sally and her new roommate?
Number 1, Bambi, when his mum dies....
Number 2, City Slickers, when Norman the Calf gets dragged down river and nearly dies... and finally, Number 3, Highlander II, as it soooo bad!
In an attempt to summarise, whilst the creators of "Highlander" produced a simple action film which was simple to relax and enjoy, when they created this first sequel to it, they created an abomination.
For some reason these exiled aliens become immortals when on Earth (sounds like a pretty good exchange to me - exile for immortality).
I don't want to know which drugs the script-writers were using when coming up with the plot for this movie.
Liza is the heart, soul, and centerpiece of the picture; when she's on-screen, everybody else is irrelevant.
is a knockout, as good as any of her musical numbers, and when he lashes out in anger, she sighs, "If you wanna hit me, why don't'cha just hit me?"
You know a movie cannot be too good when the headliner is Ayre Gross.
(this begs the question: when is Julie Brown ever funny.)
The movie attempts to analyse all the phases of a relationship, and barely achieves its goal; I would recommend you turn the opposite way when you see "The Opposite Sex" on tv or the video rack.
I would be forced to break down the plot lines (when they existed) the humor which was being pushed upon everyone.
OK or how about a "live" sketch where Eric is on the street wearing a sign saying "Handy Twenty" then when people think he's going to give a H-job he really just wants to give hand shakes- brilliant!
The only time I laughed out loud was when John C. Reilly showed up as Dr. Bruse.
It's a pretty poor indication of a show's quality when the episodes are a mere 11 minutes long, and I kept checking the DVD to see when it was going to be over.
Some nimrod here on IMDb actually compared this show to Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, in terms that when The Rite of Spring first appeared, the audience was shocked at the performance of it, and it split the audience.
I have nothing against sketch comedy and find others such as SNL and the Chappelle show amusing, but where Tim and Eric when it comes to actual humour?
Randomness can be funny when done correctly, however just being random doesn't automatically mean that something is funny.
As I stated earlier, randomness can be funny when it's done correctly (examples are Stella, Aqua Teen, and of course Monty Python, etc).
So when the show premiered, I watched it.
Story number one is about husband and wife (Nadine Van Der Velde and Marc McClure) who take the long, scenic route home late at night and when the inevitable car trouble takes place, they venture inside the obligatory Spooky Mansion Where Grisly Murders Happened.
You feel scary when you listen to a song "Tomorrow belongs to me" and see that the boy singing the song wears the Nazi emblem on his shoulder.
It gives you this sort of "I-know-what-will-be-in-the-end" feeling you have when you see newspapers and videos made years ago - yet it reveals some sides you didn't know about.
There are moments when it seems incredible how bad it is.
Thomas tips his symbolic glove in an early scene when a collapsing mine triggers falling plaster and cracks in the walls of the 'big house' in the mining village, which is home to the eponymous sisters, who pledge to rebuild the homes in the mining village destroyed by the collapse.
Why does this case rate a Major Motion Picture when so many other journalists, soldiers and civilians have been kidnapped and killed over the years.
At the time of this tragedy it was international consensus that Pearl had a death wish going into Pakistan with an obvious profile as an American Jewish Journalist at a time when Muslim Extremists and terrorists were at their most volatile state.
Its a sad day in Hollywood when important media events are exploited as soul vehicles for Academy Award Nominations...It is very sad to see the most conspicious consumers in Hollywood pretend to have a heart to place a Golden Statue on their Mantles in the name of Art and Intellectualism...Film is the avenue to the consciousness of the world we live in...My Hope is that people run out of the theatre and cringe in dismay at the abysmal performances of a technological facsimily of Acting this film gives its audience...Hollywood should be disturbed at what is considered good Acting among its elite and rein in the obvious exploitation of story, plot and heart...This is truly a disappointing and non-academy award winning film.....................
If you want sick blood and guts, get your kicks from a horror film, and when you leave the cinema you can be safe in the knowledge that you have just been shocked and exhilarated by the skill and genius of a special effects and make up team.
It is a sad day when footage from a film like this becomes public, an even sadder day when people want to watch it.
2/10, and that's only because I smiled when Bill Murray drank straight from the pot.
You think it's cool to like movies that you don't understand, when really you don't understand them because they are crap and there's nothing there to understand.
It's even more artsy to change the whole premise of the movie halfway through when the tables stop having black and white checkers and the coffee turns into tea and the cigarettes turn into one person smoking and the other commenting on how cigarettes are terrible.
And when the child is kidnapped they put their differences aside and join forces in the search for the kidnappers.
So Mike and David must fight off a vast number of scumbags using their martial arts skills(..and handguns at their disposal, when necessary) in order to do so.
I had to laugh when this movie got name checked in Scream 2.
I remember when it first came out how the kids in my class at school were so excited by it.
There's a tribe of men who steal the skull from Gramps when he had just gotten it back thanks to Charlie and Jesse's "trading" a piece of raw meat for the skull(the Ptierodactyl actually enters the world from his jungle as does a caterpillar dog!
when Jesse falls off the tree trying to pry the skull away from the friggin' bird).
There's eventually a showdown between Slim and Jesse for the rights to the skull and the cops come a callin' when gun shots are heard.
Slim tries to shoot Jesse(but his head is gone when Jesse shoots it off with a shotgun)and hits a policeman outside instead commencing in a round of fire into the house burning it down.
when someone crushes a milk carton you don't grieve the milk carton unless you can anthropomorphize (msp) it in some way and these characters weren't; they were empty.
There was vomit on the bed linens when he went to the ER.
It is not surprising that a cabaret buff such as Bob Fosse took interest in the Weimar Republic period in Germany, when "divine decadence " was the name of the game.
you showed a clip of you making fun of country music and then showed a clip of people falling asleep during your show, and then you get mad when the teenagers say you suck.
the movie was cool when he wasn't in it but when he was all he was doing was telling the world he sucks at comedy.
you ask people you obviously know are gonna talk trash about your show and when they do you get offended.
The only funny parts of this movie are when someone is actually heckling, or when Kennedy actually interviews his "hecklers", and critics.
As someone who paid to watch the performer, I really don't appreciate that in principle, but I have to admit that some of the funniest moments I've ever experienced at comedy clubs were when the performer responded to the heckler.
Sybil Danning is an extremely stunning sight to behold when she's wearing just a smile, sure, but there's only so much so can do when saddled with an abysmal script (and that's 90% of her career's work).
As I said before Danning is the ONLY reason for someone to watch this (and even then only when it's on cable, as it's not worth renting).
Additionally, it's obvious Universal simply didn't care when they made this film.
So when this was aired, all my friends told me to watch it, because it was really good.
People aren't that shallow when it comes to politics!
It is an interesting object to look at the problem in the conflict in Iraq/Kurdistan from another perspective but when this perspective is from a fascistic point of view, (Turks superior compare to Kurds) and seeks no dialog or a message about understanding the problem there, makes the viewer to leave the theater as soon as possible to go home and feel sorry for a director with so many hate within his chest!
Just when I think Hollywood is utterly stupid, I see a movie like this and realize how good we have it in America.
If they were not, Openly Gator wouldn't be so upset when Queer Duck tries to live life as a straight duck and marries an old buzzard akin to our world's Liza Minelli.
The film shows Queer Duck having a wonderful relationship with Madame Buzzard, but when she dies, it never shows why Queer Duck wants Openly Gator back so badly, except that perhaps he is lonely.
About 60% of the jokes in QUEER DUCK: THE MOVIE hit, but when jokes bomb, they bomb big time.
It doesn't help that gay humor isn't as shocking or original when the series came out in 1999.
I saw this "film" the first time when I was a teenager, late at night, on broadcast television.
I can say this unequivocally because I liked this movie when I was a teenager.
I'm gonna overlook the celebration of pornography and disco, make no comment on the pot smoking, but when it comes to the promotion of homosexuality, well, that's where I puke.
Everything about this is horrible and I didn't even have a laugh like I usually do when a watch things like these.
About the only good thing in the whole thing is at the end when the credits roll.
It's a wonder what the hell Jamie Lynn Sigler was doing in this thing when she's on THE SOPRANOS.
Well, in the scene were they are in the car, one of those guys was laughing like crazy, then, why would someone like to kill a person that hasn't done nothing to you, and to worse the thing, those guys couldn't act good, not even the Indian when is dying.
I mean seriously this movie is so unfunny and that it tries but it can't seem to land a funny joke the only people who say that this is funny like jenny mccarthys movie but seriously it sucks just that it does not even try to crack a decent joke it fails when it delivers and becomes lame as hell I wish that pornstars were funny but they aren't and putting a bunch of low rate actors who are not even good.
Don't pretend to have a "broken" arm when its clear your "acting" and if your going to enlist the help of your friends to kill a mentally retarded handyman, don't have your weapons of choice be a croquet mallet, lacrosse stick, and a hockey stick.
I knew this one was going to be trouble when I saw a talking skull engulfed in flames at the beginning.
Two unfortunate college males, heading for a shin-dig with girls, flatten their tire when coming close to hitting a hitcher(Jamie-Lynn Sigler of "Sopranos" fame)on some highway surrounded by woods.
They get in over their heads when the boys "chase" him into the woods and truly realize just who their up against.
I didn't have much faith in this movie when I bought the dvd, but it was cheap and I figured it had to contain at least a couple of scares.
A couple of years ago I did manage to speak to writer/director Merlin Ward who like nearly every British screenwriter was having problems getting money for his projects and was suffering the heart breaking experience of seeing his screenplays sitting on a shelf gathering dust , so when I heard one of his projects was finally going into production I felt happy for the guy .
Rmember when you saw RETURN OF THE KING in cinemas ?
It seems that towards the end of Brett's life, when he was at his weakest, they gave him the weirdest, melodramatic and nonsensical adaptations to showcase his talents.
Mr. Doran (when he struck it rich) would have nothing of Moulton, pulled Alice away to Europe, and decided to buy a title for his daughter.
Conan Doyle was poking fun at this ridiculous right of passage of a new snobbish American aristocracy, and showed that Lord St. Simon really was not worth the trouble (when he learns the truth St. Simon will not congratulate the Moulton's on their marriage).
I read the script of this film when it was going to production, and saw the result at the Finnish premiere last night.
I am not a fan of movies about people who live their lives in a pointless way, and when given the options to act sit like zombies and let the river of life float them downstream.
What are we supposed to make of a man who, when given options to change his situation, simply sits and waits for the inevitable to happen?
You usually get to know a movie character best when he's alone.
Things get a little more interesting when Mort starts thinking that maybe his estranged wife's new boyfriend might be behind everything, that he might have sent this psycho after Mort in the hopes of speeding up the divorce but things have gotten out of control.
I could not believe the movie was not over when the main character died, he came back to life again to bore us even more.
What Toorop (Vin Diesel) thinks is an ordinarily dangerous mission soon becomes much more when he discovers that his guest is carrying twin babies, thought to be the next Messiahs.
It looked like to me that somebody pulled the plug on the movie when it was only half done and so they just edited unfinished scenes together.
I appreciate when some movies wait to fully explain things in the end, but this movie makes one feel like an explanation is coming at some point -- yet it never comes.
This journey should be leading somewhere, but when we get there, we wonder why we bothered.
So we fight out way to the border with a few weak plot devices to make sure there's only the 3 of them when they cross.
So they take her downstairs to deliver her when Vin has a change of heart and starts fighting them... with an army or Russian bikers and an army of sect goons standing around making sure he doesn't.
The movie could have ended there... say maybe use the premise she was just coming into her powers and when Vin dies it's because she doesn't need his protection any more.
Then flash forward and she dies in child birth (so much for super advanced medicine of the future when a healthy 17-18 year old woman dies in child birth) and makes Vin promise to take care of the kids.
I'd first like to say that,im usually generous and optimistic when i see movies, and usually films my friends say suck, i say they are okay, or when my friends say they are okay, i say it was great...This one failed in 2 very important aspects of storytelling.
I'm hoping that when Babylon DVD comes along it will include the uncut, 160-minute version that the Europeans saw, along with an explanation of why it was so badly butchered before released to American audiences.
I always liked Shannon from her Beverly Hills, 90210 days and felt the show sunk down when she left, I thought she'd make more of her career afterwords, but then again, who on that show did?
If you want to see what the poor raincoat crowd had to settle for back when, I guess check it out.
I pushed fast forward to get past the plant and get to the sex scenes but when I got there, there was this creepy guy, Henry, who stands there and grins.
That really ruined the whole scene when they cut to him playing in the bushes.
While watching this movie, my wife said, "Well, they must have thought this was going to be a good movie when they read the script."
Dr. Howard Glass (Sean Kenny) and his girlfriend and fellow medical professional Nurse Angie Robinson (Monika Kelly) are having a bit of a chat when after giving her cat some Lotos cat food it attacks Angie.
There is a funny sequence, and at the same time totally idiotic, when Caleb pulls a gun on Landau and forces him to pay him money that he owe's, after Landau has given Caleb the money Caleb hands Landau the gun!
The cats can't get enough and when the flesh tainted food runs out the cats turn on their owners.
There is very little gore, and when the corpses are ground up all we see is them being put into a machine, and a pink pulp coming out of a nozzle.
While for Stephen King this may be rather good, i find it just a disgrace when you compare it to the original.
The most ludicrous example being near the end of the movie, when one of the Good Guys thinks they won't have time to perform the spell which would defeat the Bad Guys.
For instance, when one of the girls loses someone dear to her and finds herself in danger (I'm being cryptic so I don't "spoil" the "story" for you - Ha!
In his other works, King is good at occasionally creating scary moments, some even filled with prolonged dread; yet what makes his novels readable and other television projects such as "Rose Red" watchable when wading through the banal characters, plot points and scenes, is here lacking, which is strange.
Then I saw this series when it originally aired and I could only get thru 4 eps before giving up.
This was filmed in a much more conventional manner, lots of overdressed sets, music that was so present that it lost its effectiveness when it needed to be, CGI that stuck out like a sore thumb etc...
If you started watching this when it first aired and never finished, then don't bother, it only gets worse with every episode.
I don't know what Stephen King was thinking when he began writing this but I wish he hadn't.
I agree with PenGuhWin, the story works when it follows the original, but completely falls apart when they try to change it.
But this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Andromeda.
Always blaming others for their flaws and never admitting his own even when they nearly get everyone killed.
I noticed several times it looked like he smiled when approaching his crew after they just had great personal loses.
It got fast boring and when you finally get the secret it is really not interesting.
This was tragically cut short when Wolfe was fired.
Andromeda soon began to buy into nearly every science fiction clichÃ© in the book, and when it ended was a pathetic worm of its former glory.
James has got all these girls in short skirts who are robots, you see, 'under my complete control' as he boasts, who kill on command, and when they are not needed, he or Daliah Lavi presses a button in the neck of the girl and she goes to sleep.
Son Of Sinbad is a film that follows the old studio rule that when you have an expensive picture and build an expensive set, get some use out of it.
Then, there are other times, when I feel quite ashamed.
The actress Kim is overacting as a bitch and the story is so dumb that I really can't believe the hype when it was released.
There were no sound effects of the robot whatsoever, except for a clink noise when it walked.
I saw the last hour of this movie on TV when I was about eight years old and the robot walking along the deserted city street was an image that has stayed in my brain for 40 years.
I never learned the name of the movie until recently and, of course, was disappointed when I viewed it again.
He's generous with his credits and he didn't mind if people laughed at the crummy effects when the picture was released and he still doesn't mind.
So when the Dolt (we can't really call him a Man) gets shot with an arrow he should have had antibiotics etc so he wouldn't die.
The poorest decision comes when the two find a friggin' BOMB SHELTER FILLED WITH FOOD AND WARM BEDS, but after a couple days they need to abandon it because they heard somebody walking around up top.
It isn't long before the wardrobe girl gets a pick axe in her head, and when the body is discovered the police and the media show up.
Then when he is walking into town; the pirate ship leaves him--there is no explanation at all....
The Mongols are threatening the Sultanate; Simon Aristides and his daughter come to court just in time to save Sinbad and Omar from being executed; when the old man is murdered for his secret of Greek fire, the atom bomb of the ancient world, Sinbad is allowed at his suggestion to take Omar with him and try to retrieve the weapon before the Mongol General who stole it can get its secret from Aristides' daughter and deliver it to his Mongol Khan.
Its not even live action animation, its friggin cartoony as hell and reminded me of when I was 10 years old being amused by the childish pokemon crap, If you watch any other DBZ they barely do that corny Animee face gesture bs, and if they do it its appropriate.
The novel's author Ruth Moore must have flipped out when they tore her story up and created an entirely different one.
Or when the Cult Leader claims to be Jesus Christ reincarnated, Stryker simply replies, "No, you're not."
Although there are some violent deaths (my favourite being when a pretty goth chick gets axed), everything is shot in such poor lighting that it's almost impossible to see any of the bloodletting clearly.
But can someone tell me what the hell was hanging from the ceiling when the fat kid with the lisp looked up?
And when we do, it ends quickly.
Fred Vogel is obviously a talented director and he proves that in " Redsin Tower", but he's not good when it comes to writing scripts for horror flicks of this kind.
Finally the acting is just awful... at times it just seems the actors are almost looking at the camera when delivering their lines ...
I should have been happy when it finally ended, but I was only left wondering why I had wasted the last hour of my life watching this movie.
There is no sense of interconnectivity between the individual subplots, not really even at the end, when a totally gratuitous bit of violence brings just two of the sub-plot protagonists accidentally together.
Only one thing made us laugh -- when Shakes is trash-talking with another clown in the clown bar and the clown is at a loss for words and says something like, "Well, you're the captain of the diarrhea club".
Not being able to pronounce the letter "r," she sounds like me when I was 5 before taking speech therapy.
I can see why he would be so successful, as he is very over the top here, great for cartoons, not so much when you have to see his broad facial expressions that go along with the words.
I love to see modern adaptations of Shakespearean drama; I think the texts are more accessible to the general population when they are put into familiar situations/contexts.
The coup de grace is the scene when she fully goes mad and goes cross-eyed as she's flinging polaroids about.
This Hamlet is style lacking substance, as Almereyda tries to bind the limitless space of Shakespeare's text within a nutshell, only to find that there's nothing left inside when he's done.
Unfortunately, in this offering, Gertrude has been reduced to a role of silent observer in most scenes; when she does speak, however, her words are well spoken and meaningful, and it's a shame that she is so grossly underused here by Almereyda.
I'm a great Fan of Ginger Snaps and was really excited about this film when i first heard about it, unfortunately when it arrived at the cinema I was to young to see it.
There are suggestions that Palestinian refugees all "fled" Palestine when many were forced in fact forced out by Zionist militias and/or terrorism.
I actually amuse myself by playing the "3 joke game" when I happen to flip across Corner Gas.
In the first one (Mannen som log), Rolf LassgÃ¥rd did an admirable job of portraying Wallander, but I was mildly irritated when the film ended in the complete opposite way: the villain got away!
In 1916, when he switched to Mutual Studios, his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy--in many of the previous films he was just a jerk (either getting drunk a lot, beating up women, provoking fights with innocent people, etc.).
Perhaps it's due to this movie being over 90 years old when I saw this, but I could not tell what exactly happened between Chaplin and the reporter (played by director Henry Lehrman).
But, when viewing this sort of thing, I think its important to keep two things in mind ... #1: The film industry was new and inexperienced.
Overwhelmingly unattractive, obnoxious, and virtually illiterate (because why go to class when there are handbags to be bought and hangovers to be overcome), the majority of these kids have absolutely NOTHING going for them but their riches.
Like the scene when Demornay puts the cuffs on her uncooperative arrest-practice partner after sweeping him off his feet.
Though, "Growing Up Gotti" has got to be the WORST show that A&E has ever aired which in all honesty is saying quite a lot when you compare it to the asinine and mind-numbing fodder that is "Dog: The Bounty Hunter" and "Airline"!
And to think there was a time when the channel used to be tops in classy, intelligent programming that showcased the better side of American culture, not anymore unfortunately.
I mean when you're a mobster you really don't need a job at the local supermarket to put food on the table.
I cannot endure it for more than the 15 minutes I was exposed to by a not-all-that-well-meaning friend when it's a case of "Watch us!
Not by any means good (except when borrowing British whodunits) but so much better than this purposeless, offensive yet somewhat strangely impossible-to-make-compelling farce.
They weren't actually hit by a train, and when they were abducted, they were in a stopped and safe position by the tracks.
Also, when did Melanie find out that there were none of the other kids buried there?
I don't suggest watching this movie even when you have much time to kill.
But I couldn't help but notice when the flick started to dive into its "serious territory," it was becoming more and more apparent that this wasn't her forte.
And just when I thought the bar was as low as it could go, Cory Rouse stepped on the set and opened his mouth.
A good movie to watch when you're stuck at home in a blizzard, there's nothing else on TV, and you've seen everything else in your collection.
I thought that they went a little overboard when Daphny was fighting like Buffy the vampire slayer, And the worst part was Fred.
Don't get me wrong, I have nothing against rap when you can understand what they're saying.
Where's Will Smith when you need him (doing the deplorable, almost-as-bad-as-this MIB II...)?
It also seems odd with their appearance in the film that Sugar Ray didn't write an original song, instead recycling a song off of a 9 month old album (though the song was probably new when they began filming, but still...).
Cates job goes on the line when he kills a suspect who's gun cannot be found after the shooting.
And the so called surprise when the identity of the Iceman is revealed is about as believable as Frosty The Snowman.
By sheer coincidence I saw this movie again about 24 hours after I wrote the review(purely coincidental)  I had seen this when it first came out and then seen part of it again and did not like it AT ALL.
I love you to death will never be my favoroite movie but knowing what I do now I can say it's an interesting one(I just wish I'd known the true facts when I saw this years ago).  
2: You can use the time to contemplate what exactly Ted Danson was thinking when he decided to get with Whoopi.
3: It will show you everything you'll be missing when you go to one of those "good" movies.
Despite her strong feelings for her soldier, she refuses to become the wife of a member of the British foreign service, and chooses rather to be a spinster, and to love whom she wants when she wants.
The film does come briefly to life when the nuns from the first film do a cameo number, but the main returnees such as Maggie Smith (I hope she was paid well), Kathy Najimy and Wendy Makkena are irrelevant.
Even worse, when the lame-brained singing competition caps the film, you know the show is in trouble when ALL of the competitors seem better than the group you are supposed to be rooting for to win.
It's the best played scene in the film, tipping from comedy to genuinely heartfelt emotion (as opposed to Hollywood sentiment), although it's almost spoilt by the reconciliation, when they fall into a typical movie clinch.
There's this one chick that's a computer hacker and her 'pleasure model' girlfriend that has orgasms when she blinks, she says.
First of all, Buzzy's character was more like annoying than ever and the short role that she did play as a charismatic church lady I was glad when she was finally killed off in this film.
I don't know if this one's a joke but I know that it was very funny...when it was supposed to be scary.
Sheriff Bill Osco, who dresses like a truck driver, even when at the town station, is to the rescue, ready to kill the monster if he doesn't bore him to death first with his non-performance and monotone voice.
I imagine that those still populating drive-ins as this flick came out(..I'm guessing, temporarily)probably cheered when Buzzi was on her way out of the picture.
It's one thing to have star names but when their presence distracts attention from the dramatic production itself, you are in trouble.
I was laughing all through the film, particularly when those who made it took themselves seriously.
Nor was anything said about serfdom in Quebec (when you buy and sell land you get the people who work it as well) that existed 'til about the time of our Civil War.
How could it be when you had slave holding states battling other slave holding states?
They might be able to pull the new timeline crap in a new Star Trek movie but it doesn't work when we're talking about a new history of The United States.
Ruling counties like the British Empire did is one thing and could very well have worked (since the British didn't turn the people into slaves), but when you enslave the people, you fuel the embers that heat the fire insurgency.
Hitler did a similar thing when he made documentaries showing the Jewish people to be sneaky, perfidious, and greedy.
Also when the sister appeared it was kind of forced.. it didn't seem like she was a delusion
He gives us no explanation why the United Kingdom or France would come to the aid of the CSA in the spring of 1863 when the CSA was in serious trouble--i.e.
while they were racist and perhaps apathetic when it was convenient, they were by no means the fascists that kevin willmott portrays them as, and many slaves were freed before the war was over.
And when you see the mountain base from above, where's the dam suddenly gone?
As for Brosnan, a prize cheese if ever, he cosmetically smarmed and smirked through the movie with the clumsy over-confidence of an actor who thinks he's extending his range, when he's really showing off his limitations against the backdrop of a more skilled supporting cast who unfortunately looked like they were outshining him even when underplaying.
The worst and most offensive example takes place when Bond has a car race with Onatop.
What never ceases to puzzle and amuse on a personal level is when this film is rated highly by Bond "fans."
I first read about this in Fred Olen Ray's fantastic "The New Poverty Row", so when I saw it for $5 at Grimsby Giant Tiger, I scarfed it up.
Thomas suspects the women have been brainwashed into believing they're actually vampires when it fact they're not, and sets out to get to the bottom of things.
What are they thinking about when they make drivel like this.
This miserable show was shocking when it was on, taking the "celebrity reality show" to a drug-addled new low.
: Entertainment Television station that was intended more or less to be an unscripted (yeah right) update on the ditsy, southern-tinged, child-like and obviously obese former Guess Jeans and Playboy Centerfold-cum-plus-size Lane Bryant model Anna-Nicole Smith as she attempts to piece her crumbling and severely unstable life back together after numerous career failures, long public court battles with a former son-in-law over the would-be inheritance (supposedly worth millions) that she was supposed to receive when her *shudders* 90 plus year old billionaire oilman husband died back in the mid-1990's.
I know that's how I felt when I tuned in, and to be quite frank, I could only hope that no one ever makes the huge mistake of offering someone like her the opportunity to have their own reality show again!
Even when she gave her a makeover she didn't think of that!
The only decent scene is when the vampire, played by Victoria, has her head chopped off.
Even when the werewolf's identity is revealed, we don't get so much as a nifty contact lens effect or wry-fanged smile.
It's hard to stay interested as the film goes along because the characters we begin to sympathize with are each killed off in turn...which is fine as an element of surprise the first time it happens, but when it continually happens throughout the movie, the end result is that it distances the viewer and you're not left with much to care about.
in makeup, when in real life he looks nothing like Roosevelt.
My favorite scene involving Lithgow is when he is receiving very dire news from his allies and they wonder if the U.S.A. can provide just a little more aid per month.
Doesn't work when there is little attention to acting, and the script is poor.
The best part of this movie is when they drag the main character in and beat him with clubs.
Question>What do you get when you mix a bad storyline, with a bad director, bad writers, a horrible theme, and an extremely outdated moral message?
I'm still certain that somewhere, behind the propaganda, there's an interesting story - how did hatred of Catholocism spread so rapidly when only a handful of years previously, everyone in England was Catholic?
I hate it in Football (soccer to the statesiders) films/programmes when one player gets the ball and runs past everyone to score... all the time.
The kidnapped coaches escape when the two goons who have lured them into the mobster's limousine stop for gas and both have to go to the men's room just as the refs are figuring out what's going on.
No worries though cause when the refs try to call the police on the limo's phone they find out that the mobster owns the phone company too.
Finally, when Mona tries to hang herself, Phil loses his religion, and Mona packs her suitcase and trots over to Tamsin's house.
It all makes sense when you put it all together, with each reinforcing the other.
All of her biographers have noted that Monroe was furious when Dougherty told Photoplay in 1953 that she was so in love with him, she threatened to jump off the Santa Monica Pier if he left her.
Little wonder how she'd react to his claims that he created "Marilyn Monroe;" that she was forced to divorce him; and, even when she was the biggest star in the world, she yearned to return to him.
Not only is there no evidence they stayed in contact, according to the 8/6/62 New York Times, when her "dedicated friend for life" was informed of her death, he merely said "I'm sorry," and didn't attend her funeral.
I loved the TMNT graphic novels when I was little.
Why would a psychiatric ward be co-ed, especially when some of the teenagers are seventeen and some are thirteen?
Her character, who cruises for sex in public places, is in turns pathetic and fascinating and drives the film forward even when the plotlines lag.
The plot is very predictable at each step, except the last scenes, when we discover the identity of the killer.
(Quite a surprise when her alter-ego Bonnie Parker emerged,eh!)
I'm always surprised when actors of the caliber of George Kennedy and Barbara Eden have their names associated with such turkeys as this movie.
It's just hard to suspend disbelief for "Bushy Bill" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy.
They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE, and free of charge, you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters, eventually striking "pay-dirt" and fashioning a homemade Dr. Frankenstein-styled cancer-stick, all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of "Aqua Velva" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise.
Much like Survivor, every week one member of the tribe "Leaves" the "Island" when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local Institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full-blown schizophrenia kicks into gear!
Well, those big city gangsters are way out of their element when they're tangling with Gene Autry.
I remember the buzz about this movie when it came out.
The faults: 1) the mystery, when revealed, didn't ring true.
For instance, when General Bogan and the Russian General are discussing their time in London (the 1964 film), here the location has changed to Paris.
I was very very disappointed with the liberties taken with the TV version, not only did they change parts of the story (an unforgivable crime when presenting a masterpiece), but to my taste the casting was WAY off the mark.
I put Post-it notes on my mirrors and doors so I wouldn't forget ... and when I finally saw it I wanted to throw up.
Americans in our zeal are always trying to improve on things that need NO improvement ... and we generally screw things up when we do.
Dreyfuss was doing everything but somersaults in the bomb shelter apparently not knowing when enough was enough.
As it stands, this documentary works only when seen in your history class and followed by a lecture explaining it.
Often times I found myself laughing when the mood of the film was meant to be serious.
I remember watching it when it first came out.
However, the calmness of the household is broken when Jekyll starts to stay out all night, he then says he will be collaborating with an assistant named Mr. Edward Hyde (John Malkovich) on his experiments & he should be treated as they treat him.
This would give any period Hammer Horror flick a good run for it's money, then again I suppose you can stage a film like this when you have nearly 50 million dollars as your budget.
Mary Reilly is in my opinion a terrible film & it's as simple & straight forward as that, when I watch a film I want to be entertained & not bored out of my skull & that's just the way it is.
Robert's accent was really bad and the acting by both leading actors looked as if they were thinking of something else and were really bored when they were making the film.
People must think I'm exaggerating when I say this show is bad, I'm not, I myself didn't realise how bad it was until I was watching TV one afternoon, I didn't know what it was I was watching but I said to myself: "Man this show is even worse than Neighbours!"
I agree with one of the reviewers when they said that the most interesting characters are the pets.
I first started watching Neighbours when I met my girlfriend about 2 years ago because she watched it.
It makes me want to vomit over and over when people like this are licking each others a*s the whole time (Carl and Susan) One episode is enough for a lifetime, wait, no, one scene...
Don't even rent this one, but my dad seems to like this one when he watch it late one night.
Second, when Gooding gets out of his car in the end after quitting the asylum, he climbs out of the car and with more sappy music swelling does the Tim Robbins Shawshank-escape Jesus pose in the driving rain... unbelievable syrupy tripe.
Why shoot a movie when you do not like the story?
Further more it seems stupid that the movie begins with a strange story about a nuclear bomb, when that hadn't even been invented yet at Dorian Gray's time.
Looking at the message board on this page several people are asking when this film was released while people who've actually seen THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY are now asking why it was released .
I'm wondering why it was produced and when it is set .
Director John S. Robertson, used to handling costume pictures during the silent era, should have realized that less is more when it comes to baby grins and baby pouts.
It's when the negative elements of the story are overemphasized (i.e.
The movie is not bad, but when the story becomes subordinate to the movie star, it becomes a distraction and the whole production suffers.
That's find when you have a solid jumping off point.
I hate it when people say that if you win all the challenges then you should win.
Although there were 2 pointless episodes when Jenna and Sue quit.
His over-acting in every scene, even when doing nothing but lying on a bed, was a joy to behold.
One last note - I knew I was in trouble right from the start when I noticed that both of the vehicles the main characters were driving had right side steering wheels.
"A scientist has developed a matter transmitter that he is able to demonstrate for two people, when an earthquake occurs, disrupting the test and plunging the trio into a parallel universe.
What kept me watching it is Kay Lenz: she's both endearing and feisty, and she looks particularly sexy when she's angry.
(when the male lead suggests that they should follow a man).
Red Dawn starts like any other day in a small Colorado town, however the normal tranquillity is soon shattered when Russian soldiers parachute out of the sky & start killing everyone.
And besides, who's to say that USAnians won't fight as hard as any Viet Cong or Mujahedin when their nation is invaded by a foreign power?
I'm extremely critical when it comes to television and there aren't many shows around that I DON'T pan.
For some strange reason I particularly find the contestants more attractive when they're in their natural state and in their element than when they're back in the studio, all "glammed up" and civilised.
The second was when the film inspired my friend to say "He literally **bleeped** Dostoevsky in the face".
The three main characters are well rounded, interesting, and you care about them so much that the human characters seem somewhat less relevant (though not entirely because they serve as motivation for the characters to when they will return home).
What were the writing team thinking when they cooked this up?
Not forgetting, in the first film, Chance explained that before he was adopted he was a stray dog, and was abandoned when still a puppy, so he'd know a little about living on the streets don't you think?
This looks like the kind of effort you might get when you say, "Hey lets go to all these exotic locations across the world and take some pictures?
But halfway through, when I started groaning and rolling my eyes more than laughing, it became less and less worth standing in line at the Philly Film Festival for.
Of course, when the man-eating CHUD toxies show up they are guys in stupid rubber costumes, and they remain guys in stupid rubber costumes no matter how tight you cut the shots.
At the end when the bad guy drives his flaming truck into the manhole after his men have pumped the sewers full of deadly gas, you're like, great - New York is gonna blow up.
Not much is happening in its first halve but also from the moment one when the cannibalistic humanoid underground dwellers show up the movie doesn't really know to become exciting.
From the trailers I thought this movie looked awesome when I was a kid.
The dialog is hard to believe and its annoying sometimes because half the time it makes the movie go by very slowly when I wish I saw some action happening.
You never actually see the monsters, and when you do see them, the masks and makeup are poorly done.
There is also a funny part where one of the characters swallows a quarter when preventing someone from making a phone call.
Molly puts her neighbor to shame when it comes to being humane.
Someone else was correct when they said it was like an LSD trip.
Christopher Lloyd must have had De ja vous of "Thing" from "The Adams family" when filming this little beauty.
A fun movie to watch with your mates when your all broke and drunk on cider and cheap wine!
I sat watching this today on FOX, all along thinking, when is it going to get better?
It is truly one that I will always keep in my collection and never forget what it meant to me when I first watched it.
How disappointed was I when I realised (15 minutes in) that this movie was more than a disaster movie, it in itself, was a DISASTER.
But again, when Mr.
Some of these things don't really matter in this type of film but it becomes more noticeable when you don't find the movie entertaining.
The movie hit rock bottom when the characters got out of their ship into a geode that couldn't possibly exist.
The only good part of the movie is when the guy who made DESTINY dies.
Can you use a 3000 degree nuclear reactor as a power source when the temperature outside is 9000 degrees- A WIZARD DID IT.
I remember when I picked up 'Ginger Snaps' I was expecting another mediocre or below-average werewolf flick.
Ninthly, when 'virgil' was tunneling downwards, why could the people walk around inside as if it was horizontal?
Eleventhly, when the ship springs a leak?
Fourteenthly, when the power cut out from the lack of reactor rods, they hook up the power cables to the inner hull.
Why do they leave out the main character's descent into madness when he is left on the island by himself and sees the beastmen degenerate into animals?
One mistake is very apparent- far too many of the scenes take place during the day when they obviously cry out to be shot at night.
I clearly remember standing at the back of the theater watching from between my fingers as some oaf was fornicating on the bonnet of the family car... when it was revealed - ha-ha- he didn't know it was (wait for it......) his daughter!
Taking advantage of the Cineplex's "free pop refill", I exited the theatre once to get my self another large vat of cola to continue what up to that point had been an sometimes funny comedy of errors, but when I returned things simply stopped being funny.
I had to wait for the 2nd 30 minutes or so before I could see a laugh coming and when they did they were mediocre at best.
Taking advantage of the Cineplex's "free pop refill", I exited the theatre once to get my self another large vat of cola to continue what up to that point had been an sometimes funny comedy of errors, but when I returned things simply stopped being funny.
So when people start doing things that are not explained by an underlying mental disorder, I get confused.
Craig, the leader of said gang doesn't like that David isn't falling in line and when he saves some "bull dykes" from getting raped by the gang, he pays for his insolence.
No adults are seen in the film until the last 10 or so minutes, I'm not sure where all the teachers and parents are or the police when the students start having 'accidents'.
Maybe I wasn't in the right mood when I watched this as I could see why someone might like it, but for me it was a bit of a snooze fest.
True, Dom De Luise, when he finally appears on the scene, does liven things up considerably.
Critic Pauline Kael hated it too--she hit it on the head when she calls this "minimalist film-making".
Stoler as Martha has an early scene where she quits/is fired that's priceless and when her mother plays the guilt card on her ... that rings as true to life for anyone raised Catholic.
There are scenes that play like comedy when they should be tragic: the lake/picnic scenes w/ our main LOON trying to drown herself stops any pretense to dramatic tension in it's tracks.
There's some dramatic redemption towards the last ten minutes when the story finally delivers the best sequence as Martha orchestrates the murders (mother and child) that will eventually close the grisly story.
And when we are expected to believe without question or hesitation that an Italian Lothario would shack up with a fat, frumpy, hysterical nurse, the movie loses any credibility.
And they all act hysterically when they find out the truth.
Naturally, the couple murder them when this happens.
Well, I nearly laughed when the scene came on.
Usually I don't pay attention to titles when mindlessly adding to our inventory.
But yesterday I was struck as if by a malevolent satorie when this DVD came through.
"Double Team" even had Mickey Rourke when he was an a-hole everyone hated instead of The Wrestler reborn a-hole that everyone suddenly thinks is cool because he is in Iron Man 2.
Like exploding on the arena - when eventually whole the building is got blown away - what 'bad guy' of Mickey Rourke was thinking about when placing mines of such explosive power there?
:) Or what was on 'good guy' of Dennis Rodman's mind when swapping some mine marks?
She was 36 years old when this was shot but Karl Struss's soft focus cinematography helps.
If you can imagine this, you can imagine why the audience applauded when Albert Finney's character finally died because it meant that the movie was apt to be over soon as well.
It however gets really, really tasteless when the main character has a flashback of how his girlfriend died.
So I was utterly disappointed when I watched the television version it is nothing more that TV fodder to fill a gap between two other television programs.
But when I started to watch this and got about halfway through, I realized that it has absolutely none of the charm or humor of the original, and that it wasn't getting any better as it went along, so I stopped it.
I am a great lover of the original starring James Stewart, and was today flicking through the TV channels when I came across this remake.
Leslie Neilsen gives a dreadful unconvincing hammy turn as the doctor, and the other actors are similar pantomime-esquire when compared to the 1950 version.
Ford and Reynolds are actually a good screen match, but not when paired with this leaden script.
And for those who are still deaf and are wondering when they see people dancing.... 'Nowhere' is about the direction-less kind of life and thinking, people in general, have.
"Sextette" might be fun to watch on a boring, rainy day when you are home sick from school or work and want to see how many guest stars you can identify - or if you don't want to take a sleeping pill when you have insomnia - otherwise forget it!
I didn't even know that this one was readily available to watch but I immediately snapped it up when I saw it was available for rental from the local DVD store.
Despite her writing talents, West's main assets were always her figure and appearance so it's no surprise that she bowed out when she didÂwhich, of course, makes her eventual re-emergence as a heavily cosmeticized octogenarian all the more outrageous and baffling!
The Beatles also make another appearance of sorts when Mae's agent, Dom DeLuise bursts into an exuberant rendition of Lennon/McCarney's "Honey Pie"Âand guess who he was thinking of when he was singing it?
Ken Hughes helmed some good films in his day Â THE TRIALS OF Oscar WILDE (1960) and CROMWELL (1970) Â but, I guess, the producers of SEXTETTE only knew him from his comedic, big-budget extravaganzas like CASINO ROYALE (1967) and CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG (1968) when they engaged his services for this misbegotten enterpriseÂ
I first saw this movie when it came out.
Her romantic interested is played by Timothy Dalton, who mumbles a tone deaf rendition of Neil Sedaka at West, and who deserved an Oscar for keeping a straight face when he sings the lyrics "Young and beautiful, your looks will never be gone."
The director seems to have made a conscious decision to film scenes in such a way as to minimise Mae's screen time, and when she is in view of the camera it makes sure that it never gets too close.
when people ask you about Christmas films, what do bring up?
So naturally, when the new one came out I just had to see it.
If you enjoy the feeling you get when you eat way to much or when you had a really hard day or when you have a killer headache then watch this movie.
I was sad to see though that when I went to see this my childhood images and memories were reduced to a glitzed out pop film with no substance.
But I can see where this film would play well to kids who never say the original they would just see it as another movie and one the can hold in their hearts to be destroyed later when they remake it our some garbage like that.
I saw the first one when I was about five I loved it.
His humor is an acquired taste to start with, but the man is known for creating quirky characters that leave you amused by their human flaws, and touched when they realize the error of their ways.
Lame comedy that stars Tony Danza as a widowed father who freaks out when his daughter (Ami Dolenz, yes the daughter of former Monkee Micky) sports a new look.
To me, this movie is priceless because it has a high school prom scene, which, when done is the 80s, was just too cool.
I saw this when I was 9 and remember thinking how cool all the clothes looked.
On the one hand this is funny (such as the scenes with him walking in on a party and then befriending her "misunderstood" boyfriend, which winds up costing him his Jaguar), but on the other, the repetition may start to weigh on the viewer as the story becomes insurmountably ridiculous (I'm not sure where Danza was going with the explanation about being involved in the lunch counter sit-ins when he is under the impression that Leroy might have come to pick up his daughter for a date).
For some reason I liked this film when I was young, but now I can't imagine why.
Of course, now when I see 1980's pictures and see those fashions and hear that music, I'm always amused because I think, "I actually lived through that."
Here, by 1943, MGM had been producing the series for 5 years and allowed it to descend into what might be called benign disinterest only to be summarily shelved when studio bean counters pointed out the last several productions had actually lost money in their initial release.
As far as gags go, this is a far cry from "Mush and Milk" when the kids would rig a vacuum cleaner for the cow (though a lot less abusive, I will admit).
Pretty likely that some highly considered gems of today will look a little flat when the fame has faded away.
2) when a woman dies and goes unidentified, her nude mutilated body is put on public display.
This film is like when you're sitting around drunk with your friends and some guy says something clever, and then you're like "Oh dude that would make a cool movie!"
The only suspenseful thing about this movie was wondering how much longer it could go on, how much more hideous torture we would be subjected to, and when the totally predictable ending would finally arrive.
I am being honest here when I say that I gave the movie a chance.
Makes your skin crawl when you see it.
The clues are loosely presented to represent The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and what will happen to mankind when the veil is lifted.
Also, when the cops go to the store where they bought them, the owner of the store says he's only sold 4 of them to a bunch of teenagers.
Alex: I knew he was one of the Horsemen right when I first saw him act shy, blame his father for not being there for his mother when she was dying of cancer, taking care of Sean while his father is busy working, etc.
The Ending: At the end when Aidan comes home after his son dies, he wakes up Sean and Sean asks where Alex is.
That was all lost in an instant when Ziyi Zhang's character suddenly revealed herself for "what she was" - in the process suddenly going from normal middle class immigrant girl to ludicrous, evil, wry, hissing, (awkwardly) seductive, bloken engrish Oriental villainess.
In it's first scenes I thought the movie was promising, and it kept me going for like 20 minutes, without complaining, but when the plot begins to twist, I began to think that it was not worth watching, and then that it's one of the worst movies of the year.
Like I said, the beginning was promising, but the plot twists are so unbelievable and dumb, that when the final twist came, I could not believe that I wasted two hours of my life watching the worst serial killer movie I had ever seeing, when I could be watching "The Silence Of The Lambs" again.
Unfortunately, when it's revealed (well fully, all the clues are spewed from minute one) why the bad things are happening, it's so off-center and contradictory (There are no four horsemen!
And when the four horsemen comeÂwhat?)
One guy explodes, and when the blood settles, a giant beetle is in his place.
Ice must have been working on his own skills because I am sure this film is not something he brings up when discussing his past projects.
This is pure formula with too much unbelievability, like when Ice-t rats out William Sadler's character to the president and his staff.
What happens when the gangsters of New Jack City meet political terrorists?
Pam, admits that she is very angry and resentful of Kathy when she first moves into their home, but now, 18 years later, she loves her and can't imagine life without her.
His motivation for choosing her becomes apparent when he admits that Denise has made the payments on his house that kept them out of foreclosure.
Brian is out riding his motorcycle when things don't go his way.
The only redeeming moment was when Denise finally left (even if it was not of her own doing).
Especially when it was him who brought in the extra wife, anyway.
Then when picking out a ring for that same wife, he wanted her to pick out a ring that he liked.
And at the end *SPOILERS* when the other two wives wanted her gone, all he did was get up, pat her on the head, and leave.
Anyway, chaos ensues when a third woman shows up on their doorstep; Brian's third lover and soon-to-be 'wife', Denise.
I was actually glad when Anthony Robbins came on, and that's saying something.  
To be honest, the first half of the film is in fact quite amusing due to its low production value and completely dysfunctional storyline, but it becomes somewhat aggravating to watch the latter half when these redeeming qualities get old.
Maybe I'm getting carried away, after all it is for kids, but even when compared to the Elizabeth Taylor Lassie films this just doesn't cut it.
More specifically are those people who, when in reference to some of the recent animated features, say things like "Oh it's such a great film, because, not only do the kids love it, it's funny for adults as well!
There are moments where the film is beautiful, when the couple are in the forest, but ultimately the film is just VERY BORING INDEED.
Maybe I missed it, I am no expert in movie making and all BUT I know a good movie when I see one, and Blissfully Yours is NOT one of them.
Regular viewers will know what I'm talking about: when they changed the excellent original theme music (moody saxophone solo from the pen of Barrington Pheloung) and that accompanied a change in line-up.
This movie can only be viewed as some sort of "what not to do when shooting a movie".
I have never seen so many walkouts, (this was a Gala premiere remember) especially when the content was not in the least bit shocking or challenging.
At film festivals there are times when one is forced to watch absolutely bad films.This happens as a particular time slot is booked for a bad film.If there are no other films on other slots,one is inevitably forced to experience a lousy film.This is also the case with British film called "Rag Tale".I encountered this film in 2006 at Women's International Film Festival Film de Femmes Creteil,France.
The opening scene in the office was a little amusing and I wondered whether the character would brazen it out when he received the call from his boss.
She's beginning to change when she's taken in by a youth facility and locked up for drug abuse.
It seems that if there is a sex scene, that is when we see her act her best.
I was moved by this wonderful piece of art and excited when they said that there was going to be a movie.
So when Janie shows up in a sleeveless shirt to work in the muck.
So when "Dark" finds an amazingly true moment amongst the usual Araki violence, hilarity, sex and clutter (a moment to simply relax and hold the person in the bed next to him) it rings true to the heart of experience.
Because I never got to see the childhood that would have defined the characters' independent free thinking ways, I saw Janie as a slut when she kissed the boy.
On screen she comes off as lazy and irresponsible when she hates doing the work on the farm.
He only gets angry when Amos is coveting her.
It was a hot summer afternoon and I was happy to stay in and watch this John Ritter movie when I saw it featured in the TV guide, but it turned out worth not to be watching at all, unless you are planning on doing a thesis about the 70's "Me Generation", the I-want-it-all and the I-want-to-have-sex-with-anyone-and-everyone lifestyle, or maybe you're interested in 70's disco costumes and puffy super-sprayed mullet hairstyles.
This may have been a good drive-in film 25 years ago at a time when VCR's never existed.
Rarely do I ever complain so much about a soundtrack, but it just hits you like a brick when the film begins.
For example, just when the rich guy is about to kill the wolf, his wife inexplicably stops him from shooting it--even though this wolf is tearing apart their doggy.
so taking all that in to account this is a great movie to share with friends (and confuse the heck out of them) or to watch when you're feeling a little bored yourself.
Why would he even come at Brian like that when they were double dating?
Those are the best love stories, when a man or woman has to choose between two great people, leaving them no choice but to follow their hearts.
i thought it was a so called "movie" movie but it wasn't so i kept looking into it and thought it would be funny and entertaining  and then when watching it recently i was excited and then watching it i was shocked by its stupidity  boring jokes, unfunny views and Andy Milonokas.
it lacks the slightest of the humor when it comes to comparison with them!.
I remember one scene where Penn literally ran away when he saw the camera.
Shepard was a pit of lies as he attempted to push the idea that this was not about his life, but instead a "father/son" themed performance, when in actuality there was documented proof that Henry Moss was a very close representation of his father.
I remember the guilty kid with the family story and she new the kid would phone, but when the add the personal bagged which takes away from the plot the creators lose the audience.
The physical similarity between the two men is explained when they turn out to be long-lost half-brothers; both (implausibly, given Hemmings's blond looks) are illegitimate sons of the Chinese Ambassador.
As for the suggestion that Josephine Pacefoot is a satirical portrait of Dame Josephine Butler, I cannot for the life of me see why Norden might have wanted to satirise someone who had been dead for more than sixty years when the film was made and who the great majority of his audience would never have heard of.
I saw the promos i was interested especially the first promo but the last few promos gave away and i hoped the film won't be as bad but the film is worst  Abbas-Mustan tried to make a commercial potboiler instead just to appeal to the masses who like such nonsense films  The film starts off okay, 2 songs at the start itself and then slowly each characters are introduced but then the film gets boring because All characters are jerks  Paresh Rawal- Johny scenes are stupid and too loud and crass Shahid- Kareena scenes are worthless and boring They is little hope when Isha is murdered but the director is too involved with comedy, romance and nothing makes sense in the end  The Johny- Tanaaz finding a dead body in the briefcase is too childish and then the entire investigating scenes are not that great  But the end takes the cake, one of the worst climaxes ever Even the CID episodes have better culmination  Abbas-Mustan give their worst ever film Music is good  Shahid and Kareena who were a pair that time are truly wasted Shahid just keeps making big eyes trying to look funny and make weird noises while Kareena irritates Akshaye imitates his dad Vinod Khanna at places and is the only actor worth mentioning here Tanaaz and Johny overact Paresh Rawal overacts too while Payal Rohatgi and Isha are dismissal Upen Patel with a dubbed voice is painful rest are poor
and how come police not able to find passport of Kareena Kapoor at the murder site when someone has dropped it there.
"Angel Eyes" is the opposite of "Casablanca," when what happens to two little people is worth more than a hill of beans than the rest of the world.
Though you never forget it's Hollywood -- Jim Cavaziel, the primary reason I went to see it, has the saddest face since Emmett Kelly, so when he suddenly smiles you think "Gosh, what a beautiful smile!"
The camera adores Lopez as much as it did Garbo and just when you're thinking for the zillionth time "Gosh, she's beautiful" Sonia Braga as her mother leans into her and says "You're so beautiful!"
No one was more surprised than I when he sat in at a jazz club and played a version of "Nature Boy" that Jack Sheldon would have been proud of.
Here, Lopez' empty life is changed forever when she's rescued from a near-fatal confrontation with an armed criminal by handsome stranger Jim Caviezel ("The Passion of the Christ"), who seems to come out of nowhere.
Ambiguous endings only work when there is at least one satisfying disambiguation in there somewhere.
The device he thought was fake, the one which would purportedly a distant wiretapper to turn any telephone receiver anywhere in the world into a live microphone, in fact WORKED, and Harry destroyed everything in his flat looking for newly-planted bug when the only bug present was the one that had been there all along.
In this case the right circumstances mean "when the child has a severe disability."
Also for my money the narrator who is assigned in the film to "voice" her thoughts is an extremely insulting touch, how on earth can she think up more wisecracks than Mikey from "Look Who's Talking" when we already know she has the maturity of a 2 year old?!
(2.3 when I submitted this.)
A quick fact-check indicates that the cast was between 19 and 24 when making the film, and there's a huge difference between high school and college age.
Found myself mostly looking at my watch wondering when the bear would finally just eat them all and be done with it.
Even when she's covered in dirt and grime she looks great and is the only reason I sat through this thing.
Where was Daniel Boone when these kids needed him?
There's one scene in particular that stunned me, it's just after the first attack when Rich is killed & as Wes drives the jeep away next to a sheer drop & Sean grabs the steering wheel & they have a struggle which sends the jeep over the edge of the small cliff & causing themselves all sorts of problems.
Then there's the ending which feels like it has five minutes missing & a plot that doesn't make any sense with the main character's splitting up (when Sean decides to run for help why didn't all three just go?)
& at the end when they have the killer Bear trapped they hold hands & walk away very, very slowly (running would be a good idea at that point, no?)
Second is the waste dump it self why so many shots of it when they never bothered to say why, was it the reason the bear was so aggressive/seemingly intelligent, was the bear put there to guard the dump, where did the dump come from, why has it not affected the trees and ground water to get noticed by rangers and or nearby communities as from the rusty barrels it has been there for many years.
Intelligence on the people, a tire iron is not going to do much against a adult bear, going off alone over and over when as a group they would stand a better chance, not trying to make weapons such as spears at nigh they sit around 2 flash lights instead of building a large a fire as they can for light to give warning of the bear but also to use as protection not to mention to maybe signal someone that at least they were in a no trespassing area to get rangers interested.
The cabin seemed to be set up as a defensible position but they don't use it or get any of the weapons from it, also who built it when and what happened to them and when, as recent chicken remains are shown but the cabin it self look long deserted.
This film is about when 4 teens (Wes, Shaun, Ritch and Lauren) go wild after they graduate from high school, brake into private property, and kill a grizzly cub whose mother goes on rage to kill them.
These people also sustain some incredible injuries, such as falling on a bear trap, which are quickly ignored when things need to move on.
I used to watch this flick on HBO in the middle of the night when I was a kid, around 1980.
When it's deadly serious, I laugh, and when the characters crack a joke, it falls flat.
Yeah when I first saw the commercials for this movie I was like.
The cabin scene is the only scene that was remotely well done, but then it's back to stupid behavior by the next victim who leaves the safety of the cabin when he hears the bear growling.
I had to laugh when i saw the rating: 6.5!
Gone is any fear or tension when Bill rides off on his bike with Stan (it was Richie in the book, but that's not important...It's supposed to be a moment of escape, but they just simply ride away, ruining all reason for Silver to matter until the end, when the makers suddenly remembered that they needed it.
Personal Bastardization: I felt jipped when they finally confronted It and the whole deadlights business was dumbed down.
There are some beautifully horrifying scenes, such as when Beverly exits her childhood home and sees a balloon bouncing down the road, laughing.
And there was the great scene when they were children, where they hold hands in a circle and Stan suddenly finds himself holding hands with the clown.
I actually laughed at the end, when they exhibited that stupid spider-puppet as the final monster.
"I saw this movie when I was a kid and I'm still scared," or "It's the best movie ever!"
But don't hold it against him Â Michael Caine and Bob Hoskins are ropy when it comes to assuming a dialect, and even Robert De Niro fails to engage as anything other than an Italian American.
Or how about "You folks are long-winded when a small breeze will do just fine" and "Some say when God comes down to vacation on Earth, he stays at Noah's."
Find out when you watch MOVING!!
It is mediocre when compared to other simulators like Back to the future and Spiderman.
Kind of like Jessica Biel when she did that stupid photo shoot to get out of her contract on Seventh Heaven - but she got a good publicist that was able to keep it from ruining her career ...
In short, when it comes to Rock-a-doodle, just say no.
I was in a stage of my life when I never wanted to call a movie bad, so if it was, I'd lie.
Before I get into this film, I'd just like to comment on the last few minutes, when little Edmund enters into his fantasy world of singing daisies, talking birds and day-glo skies for the first time (can I take some of what he's having)?
Just when you think the movie couldn't get any worse, there's that atrocious song and dance number at the end.
I don't know what Don Bluth was thinking when he made this silly, nonsensical animated musical about a singing rooster, but I know what I'm thinking: "Why?"
There are also two live-action/animation sequences in the movie, but unlike WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, they come across as very patchy and unconvincing--the real-life surroundings don't mesh well with the drawings, and it looks especially bad at the song and dance finale when the kid actor playing Edmond, Toby Scott-Granger, is brought back to the cartoon world.
Patou the dog looked like one of the typical Don Bluth characters with over-exaggerated mouth movements so when they talk they look as if they're struggling to talk and their lips are stuck together.
Of course, Chantacleer's job (to bring up the sun) is the only job identified; everyone else just lays around or joins in when he randomly belts out a tune.
The movie practically forces him on us, and when it becomes obvious he's not working with the script, we are actually reminded that he's supposed to be funny ("He was more a hoot than he was dangerous."
No, you've really seen it all when you see a pig scared of being eaten by an owl.
I saw this movie when I was 7, and was confused by that.
And when the movie sticks to following the book it is rather entertaining in a 1950s Disney sort of way.
But when J.W.
Put short: I would fire the scientific adviser (if there was any at all) - science fiction usually does not need to care much to obey existing science but when a story is being formed around known scientific processes, errors in logic hurt the educated viewers ears and eyes.
Even Lou Gossett can't sound intelligent when the lines he has to deliver are palpably foolish.
Strange that the EXACT SAME THING happened to him eight years later when he played a Nazi in "Raiders of the Lost Ark."
This was one film i wanted to watch always when it released The promos were eye catching and Govinda in a negative role was a surprise  But the film isn't that good  It has lot of flaws  The start is good and till the murder everything goes well but the film falls flat when the romance track starts between Govinda and Karisma and the songs that follow  Then the twist about Govinda and Tabu being in love leaves more doubts and flaws and then How come Govinda turns into a rich criminal from a poor villager?
Back in 1977 when I saw this movie at the theatre with my husband (then boyfriend), we both sincerely wished we'd found some paint and watched it dry instead.
Hes got movers who won't deliver his stuff, a crazy guy driving his Saab, he got scammed on his house and hes getting blamed for all of this stuff at his new job when all he did was sharpen his pencil.
I thought they were only funny when they were together, but Pryor did a great job in this movie.
However, when she marries Wayne Morris, their marriage is a very bumpy ride.
As for Bogie, unfortunately, this film was made during his "limbo days" at Warner--when he was under contract but they had no idea what to do with him.
Reagan and his parents survive faltering patriotism, due to boredom; but, they rally 'round the flag when the Japanese attack.
(anyone who starts down the road of bad movies is aware of this almost instantly- but I digress) There are times when you watch a movie you can feel your brain being cut up as it claws in desperation to get out of your head.
Later when i learned that this film was predicted to follow Beauty and the Beast's footsteps and Beat lion king, i was increasingly disappointed.
This is what happens when you try to restrain Richard Pryor's talents to a relatively safe and formulaic setting.
Now understand, I am NOT an America-basher or live to destroy our national heroes--I just don't like it when something sacred like our history is treated with such blatant disrespect and cynicism.
my father contrasted it to world war ii when the vets came home to a hero's welcome and star treatment as opposed to what vets come home to now.
Jackson is as Jackson does and can do no wrong when it comes to acting.
beil needs to realize that she is best when she is a comic book heroin type, and cannot by any stretch play a normal average house mom school teacher type.
It is depressing, bringing out the worst part of any war, and is not representative of what our brave troops do, or what the vast majority of them live with when they return to our country.
He has absolutely no talent when it comes to acting, and when it comes to music for that matter.
My son and I love to quote those one liners when we see each other and my daughter will join us when we discuss the movie.
If in the event you would like to judge for yourself, don't say I didn't warn you when your cursing out the Movie Theatre manager for not giving you a refund.
There's no focus to this effort; the pacing plods, the performances are all over the place, and there's not a clichÃ© in the war movie book that Winkler doesn't embrace (when Chad Michael Murray buys the farm early in the pictureÂto my immense reliefÂWinkler actually has his best buddy Presley run to him in slow motion, screaming "NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!").
For example, when he visits his buddy's widow (Christina Ricci, whose tiny role in a film this bad is entirely inexplicable), she asks, "Was he a hero, Tommy?"
Victoria Rowell, as Samuel L. Jackson's wife, has a long monologue where she lists all of the things she did for their family while he was gone; he's aware of all of them ("I supported you when you enlisted!
He's awful, all dead eyes and mumbled dialogue; given moments that require a real actor (like when he accidentally takes out an Iraqi civilian), Jackson's face registers nothing.
Samuel L. Jackson is good enough, I guess, but when is he going to get back to making good films?
Shane Black is gone, in fact he walked away from Lethal Weapon 2 when they refused to make it as dark as he originally wrote it.
As well-intentioned as this may be, it doesn't belong in a film called Lethal Weapon, especially when you consider the gun violence in the 2 previous movies.
And when he's not using this completely inappropriate sound he's nicking music from his own Die Hard score.
- but keep in mind they are cops, and Riggs especially goes from funny to frenzied car-chaser in a second-and when that happens, his left behind slow apprentice, the ever-retiring side-kick Murtaugh finds himself shouting on top of his lungs "Riggs, Riggs, wait for me" , reminding me of Daniel-San in Karate Kid calling out for his Master Miyagi for the entire duration of the movie, with a not-so-bright look on his face.
-Ah, but then the fun begins again, and they forget about their troubles and make fun of Leo Getz again and the saxophone plays again,and the mood is :)...and then Riggs is a "son of a bitch" again, and Murtaugh in insensitive not to take Riggs in account when he decides to retire for yet another time...?!?
Everything that happens in this film is so incredibly implausible, ONE (there are several I could provide) example of this is when the two heroes come across a room guarded with laser death rays that can supposedly cut through stone and also flesh.
This movie is a relic from the 80's, when there were thousands of 'cold war' movies.
And when the previous owners joke "we're taking it with us!
Things really get muddled when Col. Vojnovic ends up getting murdered by the person guarding him, Constantin Barbulesco, who's not only a Croat but who's family was massacred by the Colonel's Brown Hat's during the savage fighting in his native Croatia!
I only watched this movie for two reasons: 1) it was on sat TV v late at night and I was wide awake working on some emails and 2) I was actually working in Bucharest when this was filmed - it was filmed just near my office in fact.
How could you not make a good action pic when you have: a) a great location.
Does the Romanian air force really paint 'Romanian Air Force' on its planes when Romania has a perfectly good language of its own?
I was certain that I was wasting my time through the first 80 minutes of gratuitous TV-preacher bashing (which might actually be appropriate if it were not handled with such apparent fiction and superficiality) when suddenly, at the very last moment, it seemed that a story was about to emerge.
On other hand, frequently funnier than a call to Dial-A-Joke, especially when Stanwyck (one of the strongest film actresses of that era) repeatedly, and unconvincingly, bellows "I'm a sick woman!"
They end up in the mansion of a rich lady (Irene Pappas giving a performance less lively than some of the furniture and obviously wishing she were elsewhere) because they run out of gasoline, and when she finds them in her garage syphoning off some fuel she realises she has a use for them.
Barbara seems edgy and nervous, especially when she finds them attempting to steal her husband's petrol, but nevertheless invites the couple to stay.
It belongs to an age where you had to make your own entertainment, when you only had Dixon of Dock Green on the black and white telly, while going to the movies to see a big colour film - and a woman get her kit off - was a real treat, real decadence.
Shortly after, when his assistant (played by Bill Gunn, the director) commits suicide, Dr. Hess comes into contact with his widow Ganja and sweeps her along in his strange and depressing 'vampire' universe.
What's more Diamond is thoroughly unprofessional when he tells Brown at the hospital that he would like to 'cut him open' as if he were conducting an operation and is afraid to find out "what's inside".
Mingo is devastated when Fante is killed and agrees to testify against Brown, not for Diamond but for his beloved gay lover (the Big Combo does win points for suggesting that Fante and Mingo are gay which is unusual for a movie from the 1950s).
So when I ran across this film while channel surfing one late night, it was a foregone conclusion that I would settle down to watch it.
It doesn't help when random names and faces appear at any given time; it was difficult to remember what the plot was- before you realize that there is no plot.
I generally don't, especially when the movie drags on as this movie does.
Early in the film, when Arthur and Curt are out in the snow surveying the dead cattle, snow is falling when the camera is on Arthur, snow is not falling when the camera is on Curt - over and over and over again.
And should I mention how when the panther/"painter" attacks and kills Arthur, no blood or wound is ever seen?...
Even when Curt takes Arthur's coat off...
Even when Arthur's body is draped over the horse.
Tensions boil over on a snowy Winter, when a dangerous mountain lion descends on the valley and begins to kill livestock.
Imagine my shock and disappointment when I found out that Pat and Jack were not in this sequal.
And that was when my perfect day ended.
The acting is beyond amateur, the dialogue is risible when it isn't laughable, scenes go on forever despite having already made their point.. the whole experience is beyond comprehension.
Colman was not a bad actor and when cast in tosh like "Lost Horizon" or "Random Harvest" managed to bring a touch of class to the daft proceedings, but this is way too camp even for Colman, ("I suppose queens do play around the streets of Baghdad at night", says Harry Davenport's old Agha at one point).
This travesty of a movie is the kind of thing that happens when talentless people fail to recognize their shortcomings and start trying to be the next Tarantino or Lynch.
The movie is just summed up when the i become aware that Satan was in fact just a man, with pure white long hair, which is a key stereotype for a angel, so just from that aspect any one can tell this film was so bad that i demanded a refund, i stronger recommend no one buys this movie and watches it for that matter.
The cinematography is amazing as having been to Beijing, it truly feels like it when they are out and about.
All I got out of it was--wow, why didn't I go check out this place called The World when I was in Beijing.
when i saw the trailer the first time i thought "wow", that will be a crazy movie.
I saw this alleged film when someone on a forum linked to it as "something creepy that will give you nightmares."
I knew nothing about it, and when I saw it, my thoughts were: "That's not too bad for amateur internet stuff."
And even if it doen't, there's been no sign that it's going to ring an annoyingly long time when Emily starts moving to answer it.
Of course David was recording the murder plot, when Steven laid it out at his own apartment.
That ain't a look of passion Garson's giving out with when you see this.
So when this 5'1" dynamo married a sexy Swedish bombshell on the show, credibility took another hit.
It's from a long series of "Screenliner" shorts from RKO and were intended as filler when people went to the theater to see a feature.
They accuse the (understandably) pacifist survivors of complacency when they refuse to take up once again the weapons that destroyed their world, to wage an unjustified eugenic war of extermination against the deformed (but obviously human) surface dwellers.
Vic Rondell the new fire chief has just arrived, and when one snake attack after another occurs.
Oh, & one more thing why is this called Silent Predators when it features rattlesnakes?
Actually I only saw the ending a week or so later when I caught it being televised again.
It all has a certain well-measured charm, even if the whimsical wordplay gets overbearing quite often, and ultimately it loses this charm when it is decided that the character Marie is maintaining her dignity when refusing to read aloud pornographic material by de Sade for a geriatric judge and his friends, while finding no moral objection in allowing herself to be seduced by another client.
Believe me; the only cut he should have made was to his abdomen when he fell on his sword.
Many of the English-speaking actors overact; and, when there is this much overacting, it's the fault of the director.
However, the most laughably absurd element is expecting us to believe the Japanese scientist could escape on foot from "ground zero" of an all-out nuclear war and find, several thousand miles later, a colony of two dozen or so people, when he hasn't a clue where they are going to settle.
No-one is saying that the English did not do terrible things when they settled the American continent, but to suggest that the natives lived in some kind of paradisical bliss is equally absurd; moreover, the film supplements this simplification with a dangerously inaccurate implication, namely that the only good Englishmen were the ones who settled America!
There`s other anachronistic details when the action ( Inaction more like - This is a boring movie ) tranfers to England which I won`t bore you with since you`ll be bored enough without my help .
Yet, when Arenas' writings are quoted, the soundtrack switches to Spanish, translated into English subtitles.
Why didn't the protagonist leave Cuba when he had the chance?
A person's life story could make a very interesting film, particularly when the person has had as much adversity to overcome as Reynaldo Arenas.
And when you consider that Arbuckle himself plummeted from a position of wealth and celebrity to genuine and lasting disgrace, due, according to the most credible research, to a tragic misunderstanding, the weepy close-up of Roscoe in his jail cell that concludes this film is even more disturbing than it might otherwise be.
Reality check Hollywood; men run for the exits when they encounter women like Marty Durand who all but has a sandwich board sign declaring her bi-polar/border line psychotic personality disorder and women loathe self-centered attention seeking vapidness that she represent.
There are few things more disturbing than watching someone play chipper and happy when their eyebrows and forehead are frozen stiff.
i don,t understand at all what has to do Albanian restaurant with Arabic music,,i saw the scene when they were in sk Albanian restaurant and the only thing Albanian there was the flag,,nothing else,,albaniens does nor have bellydancers in their places,,but i guess ,,someone when wanna make fool of albaniens did payed a lot of money to mix Albanian people with middle easy people,,probably it was Russians or Serbs who payed those money to George gallo for mixing albaniens with Arabic people,,nothing wrong ,,people are all same everywhere,,good or bad,,but AL least when you try to make something Albanian,,make that in right way,,not only lies there,,as an Albanian,,i feel humiliated by that horrible music,,pretending to be Albanian music,,but it was not Albanian AT all
I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to romantic comedies, especially those out of Hollywood.
Maybe the knife slipped and the surgeons cut something else out when they were redesigning her face.
That Porky; just when you count him out - here he comes with the whole Angel Beach High gang to strike one final blow against a series that degenerated so far down the tubes that even Bob Clark wouldn't have anything to do with it.
And when his little girl Blossom (Wendy Feign) falls for good old Meat (Tony Gainos), it's time for Pee-Wee (Dan Monahan) and the rest of the crew to kick into high gear and save their buddy from a fate worse than death - marriage.
Do not tell me about "social awareness" when only profit to powerful monopolistic companies was involved!
I think what really irked me was this film's supposed commentary on America's penal system, when really it seemed like a snarky attack on the Deep South.
With some films, when I'm not quite sure, this "probation" time is prolonged to 45 minutes.
It's a sad thing when the best you can say about a movie is a person's figure and looks.
In the part when the lava began to "burn" the city it looked like I was watching a cartoon.. To sum up I wasted 2 productive hours of my life watching this movie personally, this film may deserve a score of minus 4.
A note to film makers: a shouldercam is only to be used when using anything else wouldn't be practical or for trying to give a quick and temporary intimate "you are there" feeling.
Wa-a-ay too much use of shouldercam here when a tripod-mounted one should have been used instead.
The characters were wasting precious moments futzing around when moments were too precious to waste.
Apparently thrown in for "dramatic impact" when in real life, you know the characters would be hopped up on adrenalin and moving their butts like greased lightning.
Travel is a constant theme visually and of conversation - when a country bumpkin shows up, the surprised greeting is "How did you get here?"
There are moving scenes when immigrants with different languages try to communicate to share the commonalities in their lives -- a Russian immigrant is terrified when her passport is taken away, while the Chinese woman is envious that she even has one.
It is a bit confusing keeping up with the various characters, in and out of their work costumes, especially when the two main characters seemed to change so much without explanation, but they are enormously sympathetic so it is devastating as we see their hopes and dreams, however unrealistic or selfish, defeated.
I started watching this movie when SyFy broadcast it a few years back, but couldn't get past the scene where the guy's intestines literally fell out of his stomach (not terribly realistic, but still a bit upsetting).
However, my curiosity got the better of me, and I did sit through the whole thing when it was on a few weeks back.
She doesn't believe Matt when he says he saw lava in the tunnels.
Dr. Levering is badly burned, and left unconscious when the volcano starts to erupt at the drilling site.
Such temptation should be firmly resisted, especially when the worthy name 'Michael Ironside', whose character utters the immortal line in the title of this comment, appears in the credits.
On the other side, you've got a tunnel digger and a geologist who just happens to be the tunnel digger's ex-wife and when they meet in the movie for the first time, you've got the sappy music for them.
Throw in some incompetent DHS and FBI investigators; an incredulous mayor and his scheming, corrupt deputy; a female Sand Hog whose daddy was a legend among Sand Hogs; a foreman who is overly safety-conscious, except when he's not; and the unfortunate but gruesome deaths of several supporting "color" characters and you've got your standard disaster movie fare, all dressed up with nowhere to go except straight down the tubes.
Perhaps we can console ourselves with thinking that we can have some control over terrorism when faced with the towering realities of volcanic activity.
The employees live in overcrowded dorms or sleazy hotels and a group of Russian performers have their passports taken away when they arrive and some are forced to become prostitutes.
The begining starts off promising, it moves in to a beautifully shot hunting trip, and then pretty much when you get to the crap weasels and stupid looking alien its all down hill.
May be it is very hard to make a good Stephen King adaptation when it involves creatures not from this earth, or in a different time, or et cetera.
The "ride" seems interminable and there's almost no conversation between them, so when they finally begin to show an interest for one another, you may find yourself asking "Why?"
okay maybe i am a little to hard, but when i watch a film i expect certain things and so it should be advertised as an experimental film.
Some of the characters were given dialog that sounded like it was copied straight from a community service announcement, then there was the plot which was so thin it was generally hard to find, and when the director seemed to be totally lost, he would throw in a sex scene.
This ride was WAY ahead of its time when it was new, and is still a great ride and lots of fun.
I can imagine this got produced when a TV exec walked into the TV writers workshop and said " The Brits have produced a great little film called 28 DAYS LATER so who`s got a script about a virus ? "
Designating them as writers seems like a shortcut to make us think these guys are "deep" when in reality they come off like characters from a bad American Gen X 1990s movie.
Also Wtf is with the mine scene that was SO bad they some would have died and your going to jail for ever anyways you terrorists just kill someone seriously toy soldiers is Way better and they would of killed the cops when they shot like 1000 bullets and them like what the shiz what are the cops doing just charging thats so stupid i would just kill the children I'm not even and the terrible sewer scene yet that I've herd so much about.
It's just grates my guts when shoot out movies are called slasher movies... oh and this movie is so awful, it's hilarious.
So, as you could imagine, it is pretty boring and even after that, when Ricky explains what happened to him after the ordeal at the end of the first one (in which his brother is shot dead in front of him), it does not get much better.
The plot doesn't matter, it in fact just shows clips from the first movie through the middle of the movie, but when you meet the title character Ricky face to face you realize that the movie is taking a turn for the best/worst.
but lucky for the movie i love laughing at movies whether when it's meant to or not.
In one scene he flashes back to when he was a newborn baby, because, of course, vivid memories are easy to keep for a baby.
Even when his flashbacks are of new footage, they're still boring, and extremely poorly acted.
It has everything -- a lead actor who moves his eyebrows up and down to convey strong emotion, unnecessary (ludicrously unnecessary) nudity, idiotic death scenes (the best one is when Ricky shoots a car with a handgun and it flips over and explodes).
Yes he DID try to rape her beforehand but still... And when Ricky and his fiancÃ©e go to the movies they end up seeing the first movie which means we get to see it TWICE!
The most inventive kill comes when he attacks bookie with an umbrella that opens after being thrusted through the stomach.
Even more despicable than that is when Ricky attacks a wheel-chair bound, facially scarred nun with an ax.
Ricky's flashbacks date back to when he was less than a year old in some cases, where it would be almost impossible to have any memory.
I didn't know this film actually was a re-cut of the original when I begun watching it (remind me to check this site ALWAYS before renting a film!)
The first thing anyone will admit when mentioning this movie is that it is terrible.
Just when you thought this film series couldn't make LESS sense, here comes "The Prodigal Planet" to show us how very wrong we are.
Much like the aforementioned movie, I came across it when different friends of mine attempted to discard a movie that they said they could not stand through the opening credits.
And for some very weak plot reasons when Quinn has a chance to let the mob dispose of the 'traitor's' son John Derek he chooses to save him and keep him in the palace.
The only problem was he was an idiot when he used them.
I rented this movie from my public library along with Beverly Hills cop 1 and 2.The first two were really great and when I was about to put it in I had a thought of 'how bad could it be'.Well the first 10 minutes were good but then all the comedy and good acting got taken away.I only became excited once when they had George Lucas has a cameo so thats not really saying much.
From the brutal approach to movie action of the former ones (thanks to Bruckheimer), this one has scratched most of this off (no more social realism of the first and no more really bad guys of the second) and replaced it with superficial layer of humor and Murphy's funny faces, which really aren't funny when you've seen them before in his stand up comedy shows or The Nutty Professor.
The comedy, when it comes, is forced and weak - the bizarre reappearance of the hideously annoying Serge (Bronson Pinchot) signals the sheer desperation of the writers.
I saw it in the 99p shop once when I was looking for wrapping paper and on a whim I purchased it.
The convoluted story of a Hollywood legend unable to live up to her famous past is exactly what happened to Wilder when he decided to direct this film: Wilder was too old to direct this film.
FEDORA, the film itself, is a pale example of what the director could do when compared to his films of the past, like SUNSET BOULEVARD and SOME LIKE IT HOT.
Needless to say it is still on our list to catch when at the Disney parks.
I want at least SOME try at disbelief suspension when I watch TV, SOME chance to get into the story.
For example; when the baddie throws a passenger out of a 747 door whilst flying above the airport, on a stormy night, just to prove a point, the body just happens to fall through the glass roof of the control tower where the team are negotiating with the hijacker.
Then, as the plane flies over the airport, he carefully and judiciously calculates wind speed, vector problems, and trajectory so that when he drops the poor sap, the body will rip into the Control Tower like a missile.
My favourite part is when a terrorist starts babbling in Czech, and Jennifer Beals offers to try and interpret since she learned a few words of Polish from her Grandmother as a child.
One amusing part was when the terrorist threatens to blow up the anthrax bomb in the plane.
Another amusing part was when a passenger attempts to talk to a Czechoslovakian terrorist.
The only decent part of this movie is when the bloke gets chucked out of the plane.
His methods are tested to the limit when outlaw Frank Brand (Rod Taylor in a surprisingly sadistic performance) and his gang rob the local bank.
For example the mother in law refused to look after the children when the main character (Owen) had a business trip to make.
The girlfriend refused him when he asked her to look after the kids for a few days.
I've been a fan of Crash since I was 7 and when I was 13 and saw this game I thought it was going to be a breath of fresh air ever since Naughty Dog no longer was in production of this game.
Another thing that annoyed me was the fact that Aku Aku SUX at protecting you he's says he will but when you walk into those TNT/Nitro boxes (even if you have three masks) you will DIE!!!
The Niece-They seriously jumped the shark when they introduced her to the game!!
They are utter psychos, however, when it comes to production quality.
I was giddy with girlish-glee when I found out about this movie shortly after seeing Spirits Within.
It hurt even more when they reduced the Turks to less-than-just comic relief.
like when all of the characters from the game show up just in the nick of time for their obligatory screen time so as not to upset the fans.
A bunch of scientists end up making giant wasps (Hate it when that happens) so they have to trek through darkest Africa to stop them or something.
They honestly don't seem intent on stoping them, nor are they truly prepared to handle them when they find them (A good deal of the crew are slaughtered).
Have you ever wondered what a giant wasp looks like when appearing in a zero-budgeted 50's movie?
But when your mind is set on watching a low budget movie perfectly fit for the drive-in theater, MONSTER FROM GREEN HELL will suffice.
Makes a whole lotta sense when you're a young kid paying to be frightened.
This is typical Fifties science fiction when all kinds of radiation was the explanation for these creatures.
Directors should not be allowed to get away with hijacking a masterpiece such as Les Mis without the necessary criticism when they do not produce something truthful to the text.
I put up with the characterization errors (the characterization that made the novel so wonderful) but then I turned it off when I saw that they'd made Valjean the mayor when he couldn't read or write.
- Enjolras is a necessary character - ABC is pronounced "Ah Bay Say," it's a pun - Eponine isn't entirely necessary, but the movie would have been more enjoyable with her - Cosette is not a teenage rebel without a cause who throws a tantrum when she does not get her way - Valjean would sooner hit himself than hit Cosette   I could go on, but I won't.
- After six weeks of evacuations, there are still people waiting at the airport when the big day comes.
Bet they felt silly when they got back to their base and found that all their work was lost cos they were too dumb to notice something as obvious.
I have to admit, when I first heard about this film, I hoped to watch it and rate it was perfect 10.
The potential family comes in to meet theirs and naturally they wonder why the older one isn't married yet, so the propose that one of their other sons marries her, that is when Rani's character drops the bombshell on them all that she is already married.
One afternoon, she spies her husband hugging a woman at a train stop and mistakes it for an affair, when she later finds out that the woman her husband was hugging was none other than her little sister, she races home to make things right with her husband again but meets a very bad accident.
That's when the Yashraj Peep whip out one of two people who probably brought Saathiya the crowd it did at the box office.
Naturally, Somers was the only one surprised when the network, one run by Australia's answer to Rupert Murdoch at that, was no longer interested in Somers' ideas.
Red Faces, even when its contestants were as boring as the rest of the show became, managed to entertain because of regular judge Red Symons.
My personal favourite was when a man dressed in a bad chicken suit attempted to do a twisted keyboard and vocal version of These Are The People In Your Neighbourhood.
The problem is that getting anything canceled in Australia is an uphill battle at best, even when advertising revenue is not a tenth of what it could be.
But when an Irish gang kidnap the guy's family in order to get him to cooperate in a little heist they have planned, they don't count on his resilience.
5) Kuki must deal the compiling stresses of being a ranch hand in Africa, especially when people close to her heart pass away.
I hate it when 4,000 babies are being aborted a day in the USA, and yet I'm supposed to cry over a dead rhino which is far more important in their eyes.
This probably would have been a good book - something about perseverance in the face of tragedy and everything that nature throws at you - but for a movie to plod along like this without you ever really caring about the characters **Spoiler** such as when the husband is robbed - his emotion and her face as she held him were just NOT there.
Even Maurice Jarre's music did not seem much inspired, as it careered rather hesitatingly among various influences, and indeed the best was when the native chants took over.
I swear they were on drugs when they thought a rip-off of Sydney Pollack's Out of Africa was going to profit, with a budget of $34 million.
I watched some of this when going to see another movie, while waiting.
Sometimes fairly good, but when deep emotion comes in, seems forced and unreal.
(I recommend this film to any serious balletomane for that reason)  It's when he has to talk that the film runs into trouble, and since he's the entire film, it's major trouble.
But let's face it, this is a very clumsy attempt at retelling the life of Valentino and while Nureyev was excellent showing us the tango, he looked like a fish out of water when it came to dialogue.
later when one vanishes they look to find his video camera lying on the beach (farther away then he dropped it.)
when the corpses of fellow boarders come back to life they do what "kill" which isn't much of a climax, after a few die only two are left to leave and fight off the dead (which is choppy by how the camera is moving so fast to catch all the action)none the less once they leave on the dirt bike which was left there they meet the pact leader to decide there fate.
But when they get there the brother and his friends are nowhere to be found.
There are awfully silly lines, and I believe that the winner is when Lucky asks what "km" is and Colin (I guess) replies that it is a shorter mile.
The camera and lighting are terribly poor and the best scene in the movie is when Rose removes her bra and shows her wonderful breasts.
Gave me a lump in my throat when I thought Suhani was going to die.
You'll wanna go get in line again when the ride's over!
In one priceless scene, when, without inter-titles, the Bill Boyd character whispers the explanation of a word (often found in the Bible), Wollheim's expression almost makes the whole movie worthwhile.
Phony sweetness (when you know the kid is really a murderer) plays, for awhile.
An utter waste of time & I can not stand when people say to please not remake this.
Hepburn has trouble making the big finish because she "chokes" when her boyfriend is around.
It was funny when she wet her pants but I think that everyone was too hard on her.
I didn't think that it was that big of a deal and she seemed like a good maid except when she went completely nuts.
This sort of thing was done better in the 90's on ITV when Rendell's books were divided into 120 minute episodes.
I didn't mind when they used Suhaani's accident as a plot device for the ending.
Eccentric young man has chance to mend errant ways when guardian angel pays a concerned visit.
From the title and what little I knew about its subject-matter, I was expecting a BELLE DE JOUR-meets-JACK THE RIPPER kind of thing but imagine my disappointment when, after an intriguing start, this is forsaken for boring political machinations which ineffectively breach thriller territory towards the end.
We ran into early problems when few actors we approached for the female lead were willing to play this kind of a role.
Just when there seemed to be some sensible movies started to come up in India, in 1994 this movie got released and brought us back to where we were 10 years back.
Many of you are familiar with the feeling when after watching a film (or midway through it) you think that this was a complete waste of time and money.
He matured in a simpler time, when white hat vs. black hat was expected, not just acceptable.
I knew I was in trouble when all the actors were wearing the cleanest, neatly pressed dirty clothes I ever seen in a western since 1934.
I had a bad case of the runs and a fever when a 'friend' brought this flick by hoping it would make me feel better.
Because when someone you love almost passes away or does pass away, everything doesn't matter anymore.
So, when I heard that production wrapped up, I was saddened...no more Chairman Kaga and no more Iron Chefs!
Another problem is that when Americans watch the Japanese shows, they have no idea who Chairman Kaga is--and so it makes the idea of a real kitchen stadium seem almost possible.
I only laughed once, was when one of Mike's friends, sucked in helium n began 2 speak in that squeaky voice.
Every killing is in slow motion and when the lady is being kidnapped she doesn't even try to escape.
If you pay more than $5 to own a DVD of this movie by itself, you will probably be looking around for a throat to slit when it is over.
I wish it had stayed that way, because once things start happening that is when the movie gets really annoying.
(Like Sting's famous song-line: "Life was easy when it was boring", or "This film was easier when it was boring".)
I admit, I was incredibly excited(..maybe, TOO excited)when I found a rare VHS copy of this at a local rental store going out of business, so a degree of disappointment was too be expected.
These were the days of the 'video nasty', when the likes of Wes Craven's Last House on the Left, Meir Zarchi's I Spit On Your Grave and Sam Raimi's the Evil Dead were available to rent, uncut and uncensored, from your local friendly video library.
There's none of the fast-paced, joke-a-second, semi-hysterical mayhem that marked the best of Everett's television work, and (surprisingly for a film scripted by Barry Cryer) there are very few actual jokes - indeed, when director Ray Cameron presents the viewer (in the opening moments) with a barrage of shockingly violent murders, shot and staged in a bizarrely straight-faced manner, one has to wonder what on earth is going on.
He doesn't even try to build suspense around the possibility of sudden violent death at any moment, and the deaths when they occur are indifferently staged.)
Things get even sillier when the protagonists go to a bizarre "resort"--hence the retitling "Club Extinction"--that's like Club Med meets Jonestown meets "The Prisoner."
The Portuguese had only fled Angola and Mozambique 6 years earlier when Portugal and Spain threw off the fascist yoke themselves.
The reason is that when the British government received the huge pieces of land in the Berlin Conference of 1884, they simply did not know what to do with it all.
when they say that the visuals and the VAGUE fundamental mood of the film is good.
However I was really disappointed when I found it was for all intents and purposes an American film shot in Iceland.
Beyond the b-grade artistry lies a filmmaker with a promising talent for composition, often showing his best, least obvious strength when setting up succeeding, more important shots.
As well, the script might have seemed a lot more convincing when on paper (which would explain some of the big name interest), offering a humbly ambitious, localized little guessing game centering around insurance fraud.
I wasn't excited when I watched this movie, I was somehow looking forward to the end of it.
Cate opens her legs for an RAF flier the first night she meets him (slut alert) and, when he disappears in France a few days later, she decides to find him (getting a number of French underground fighters killed along the way).
Whatever was Cate Blanchett thinking when she accepted the title role in this stupid little number?
Reminds me of that story of a very poor Anne Frank's Diary production where the audience were motivated to shout out 'she's in the Attic' when the German first came on stage.
The script essentially relies on sexual tension to function properly, and it doesn't, because the gentlemen cast opposite Kate are such bland pretty boys -- soap opera sidemen -- that you only feel uncomfortable for them when things start heating up in the bedroom.
It may be that there actually aren't any leading men fit to play opposite Ms. Blanchett in this year 2002 as a consequence of 10 years of increasingly vapid and effeminite chiseled-jaw frat boys taking over the screen, but regardless of the systemic explanations, there's not much to do but blush or laugh when you note that Billy Crudup's voice is registering about an octave higher than Ms. Blanchett's.
This film recently surfaced on Channel 4.I saw it when it came out and thought it awful then and my view has not changed.What grates with me is the fact that it trivialises the role that many brave women played in SOE.Cate Blanchett is approached on a train.Well that just would not have happened.She seems to have been sent to France without a defined role.One minute she is a courier then she is involved in the blowing up of the train.She is constantly asking people for their names,and then if that is not bad enough she tries to find out about her RAF boyfriend who is hiding in a French village.Then she becomes involved in trying to avoid the roundup of Jewish children.None of this is in any way true to life.Watch "Odette" or "Carve Her Name With Pride" to find a truer representation of SOE agents in France.
Then when she finds out that Doug loves someone else, she's just happy for him?
Tone it down a little bit so that when you finally have that big makeover scene, there's a real reason to be impressed!
It doesn't stand very well on its own but when compared to other culturally-centric films such as "Like Water for Chocolate," "East is East," it brings up the bottom of the spice barrel.
I went with 2 of my sons who are major film going people and when asked to describe the plot line,simply could't.It is long- and feels long.Dylan McDermott is easy on the eyes- he uses all the usual tricks to allure- unshaven,motorcycle,architect....but there is essentially no chemistry between him and Ashwarya Rai.
that scene when they're in bed together felt like watching the weather channel, no scratch that, it felt like watching my grandma cutting her toenails while watching the weather channel.
I cried when I hit the stop button, but I just couldn't take anymore.
You are in a strange fusion of bus and spaceship.The cool thing is that the simulator is very realistic and loyal to Star Wars Saga, so you can sense a great speed when you enter Hyperspace or when you are evading laser shots at the Death Star.
It is like when you know which spices provide what relief, I would not visit that store again.
Aishwarya is absolutely beautiful, and I'm sure that she can act - when she's given something to work with.
A vengeful father misses out on his sons life and takes out acts of violence on the people involved surrounding his suicide, maybe Vengeance would be a more appropriate title, the storyline is awful, it has no actual links with hell until the very end when Pinhead finally makes a short appearance.
"Hellworld" is a fine movie when you don't see it as a "Hellraiser" film.
They should have used another actor to play Pinhead, this movie surely couldn't have been made worse by it.What were they thinking when they made this garbage?
When sci-fi/modern technology mixes with horror, when has it EVER been good?
Usually I think people just haven't given a movie a real chance when they give it 1star out of 10, but this movie do not deserve anything but the worst possible rating.
Now, it does nothing but cause fleeting moments of despair as I recall a time when Pinhead was effective.
It's actually a mystery why it was even made part of the series, when it'd worked quite nicely independently...
I have to mention two positive things about the movie: Lace (hey, it doesn't matter if it's a brilliant masterpiece or Z-class production when Lance is in it!)
We're in a perpetual state of not knowing what we're supposed to be concerned about until 80 minutes into the film, when instead of revealing the answers to the mystery by making connections in our mind for ourselves, we're dealt a five minute scene of the villain saying, "Let me explain my dastardly plan that's been going on for the last 80 minutes, that you as an audience were completely unaware of, while you watched random scenes that still don't make any sense or have any connection to the plot, even after I've explained it."
There is a perfect illustration of the solution near the end of this film, when Chelsea gets locked in the room and Adam starts calling to her from under the floor.
When someone in a horror movie does something that stupid, it is generally because the filmmakers need to have the character killed off but can't think of a really clever way to have it happen, so they just have the character do something monumentally stupid, but the problem is that this places the blame for their death on themselves, and in a horror movie, it's not only not scary when someone is attacked after doing something as idiotic as putting her hand through the crack in the floorboards because she thinks she sees her dead friend down there, it's satisfying, and not in the good way either.
It's kind of an ominous sign when even the director doesn't know what his movie is about.
The story follows the death of their friend, something about that game, and then cuts to a few years later when all of his friends get invited to a party celebrating the said video game.
And, of course, A. R. Rahman's score is terrific -- particularly when pouring out of a theater's surround-sound system!
I'm all for keeping Cenobitic appearances limited, but then when you DO use them, for God's sakes, use them WELL.
when the movie ends one feels why did i even bother to watch it.
The daughter in law(Nandana Sen) has a family secret when her brother comes in the picture.
The part that I liked was when The Antichrist (Franco Macalausso) was bragging about his history (being Lucifer, having a throne in heaven with God, and how he thought he was better than God).
And when a guy comes along who does solve our age old disputes and brings world peace, inherently he HAS to be evil.
For some reason the story then becomes a work outing on Brighton Pier, but when everyone does get back, everything is resolved.
Also starring an annoying Hattie Jacques as Beattie Plummer, Jacki Piper as Myrtle Plummer, Patsy Rowlands as Hortence Withering, Worzel Gummidge's Bill Maynard as Fred Moore, Davy Kaye as Benny and Margaret Nolan as Popsy, but where's Barbara Windsor when you want her?
Some family is sailing at sea, the mother tucks the kid into bed then hears a disturbance from above, when she resurfaces and father is clinging to one of the sails by his fingers, in the clutches of a giant squid's tentacles.
The Kraken never looks menacing, not even when its tentacles embrace a medium-sized ship.
They should make a law against the spreading of TV-movies in video stores, especially when they do not indicate anywhere it's a TV movie!
Director Tibor TakÃ¡cs might consider a late career change, as he hasn't accomplished anything special since the late 80's, when he made "The Gate" and "I, Madman".
In many ways the story resembles another Benchley story THE DEEP which might not be a problem as such but when you've got a film called KRAKEN:TENTACLES OF THE DEEP then a prospective audience is expecting a giant squid to be the focus of the story rather than humans .
The producers seem aware of this shoehorning a squid attack just to remind the audience there's a squid central to the plot when in fact it's the producers themselves who obviously need reminding   As it's produced by Nu Image Films the production values are rather poor with the squid being a rather obvious CGI creation .
Like nearly every film featuring a giant squid it makes a roaring sound ( Squids are mute ) and can grab people off the decks of ships ( Considered impossible by leading scientists ) and of course when someone gets devoured underwater there's a big bubble of blood rising to the surface .
The character's are bland & forgettable as is the dialogue, the giant squid isn't in it nearly enough & doesn't do anything particularly special when it does make an appearance.
An illustration of the low budget is when a motor boat is "destroyed," you only see this as a CGI image from a distance.
Can anyone honestly believe any of the characters when they say "I love you"?
The only thing I liked was when Portman's character finally realizes, at the end of the film, "I don't love you anymore".
You know when a movie isn't working when you start to see the script roll in front of you like an autocue, and when you think you can see the crew looking on as the actors work through their lines.
10) The new Hollywood formula requires a "surprise" twist at the ending, even when it's not a surprise.
Get it for the kids, watch it with the kids (cover their eyes if you don't think non-married adults naked under the covers is kid-friendly), and maybe keep it around for those long Christmas vacations when you've already watched all three sets of Lord of the Rings, Extended Editions.
Her first artist name was "Lady MacLeod" after a supposed lord father, and it didn't disappear from the posters until 1912, when the real MacLeod (her former husband) sued her.
That the name of Mata Hari has become synonymous with a master spy is definitely a factoid, considering her very short career as well as her very limited skills in the craft (even when compared to her colleagues), not to say naÃ¯vety.
(Like when she attempted to discuss her mission in clear in ordinary mail or over a plain telephone, or when she refused to use invisible ink.)
To be fair the cast are not given much to work with when the scriptwriters blatantly copy dialogue from Dirty Harry movies and write one liners that are to humour what an elephant is to skateboarding.
Shahin still insists on using songs & dances in his films which alienate viewers from the serious continuity of the film, when it exists.
My girlfriend walked in the room when I was watching it and it literally took twenty minutes of viewing to convince her that I wasn't watching a porno.
And when two might turn into three a crisis ensues.
If Hawkes has any short-comings, it's when he brow-beats the men and has half the ship's shore patrol laboriously construct a sailboat for the purpose of building 'morale'.
It drags the movie down to the depths and just when you think that it's about to get even worse, Mitchum and Tommy Rettig (the child) bring it back to life.
Whenever one of the stupidly acting muscle fighters appears, you just wish them away and would like to see more of the lovely harbors and landscapes and sheep... and when the film is over, you wonder why they haven't shown more of the beautiful sites of Ireland and just haven't erased the whole plot and actors from the film... the whole film could have been a really nice holiday documentary.
People reveal their thoughts aloud when alone just for the camera.
But if Matheson ever saw this movie, he must have upchucked when he heard Lysette Anthony's impassioned occult incantation, in which she invoked the great and mighty god Tetragrammation.
As this is taking place after the battle of Endor, how can there be another Death star that is completely built up like the first one, when the second one was no where near completion?
So when I saw this playing on the Sci-Fi channel, I didn't hesitate to watch it.
Well, the first story is about a woman where her husband dies and she discovers his grave is missing and encounters horrible things when she finds out there is more than what meets the eye.
The only thing I enjoyed about the last story was that I did get more than a few laughs, especially where they did her grabbing the blade of the knife from the doll when he is trying to get out of the suitcase she locked him in, and she goes for the blade once, gets cut, she acts surprised, but does she learn anything?
(I love it when the woman and the security guard suspect a killer is in the multi-story building and the guard insists she stay in the lab with the door locked while he checks the place out, even though the door to the lab has a flimsy glass window on it).
The story then serves as a strict remake of the first one, with Anthony trapping the doll in a case, cutting herself while trying to grab the knife when the doll saws away at the case, and then becoming possessed by the spirit in the doll at the end.
(Yes, you can tell this was made for TV...) Greenaway never knows when to get out of the way and let the images just breathe on their own... there is far too much information on screen at all times.
I'll give the cast credit with what they had to work with, I know amateurs when I see them, and at least half of the cast ain't that.
These 90 minutes felt like hours upon hours, and when it ends, it is completely ass-nine.
one of those it is so bad it is good movies) b\c it takes itself so seriously, when it should know that the audience, given the cast and the non-mass produced title, has already given it two strikes against it.
The script is unique & has at least some originality about it but that's simply not enough when the whole concept & execution is so bad.
grandmother when she misses with red lipstick.
For the most part THE BOX is not a bad film but its not a very good film either, plainly put I had mixed reactions about this film, it had a good concept, the acting was above par, it maintains a slow pace throughout but when it ended I felt really disappointed because I waited for something big to happen and it never did, there was no major car chase scenes but there were a few quick shootouts nothing more, there is just nothing to get overly excited about in this film.
And that's when the fit hits the shan.
However, Paramount are in really bad shape if no-one there has the power to say STOP even when presented with this load of rubbish.
Additionally Picard takes up with a Baku who has spent her last 300 odd years learning how to look like a pouting airhead even when tons of rubble are falling on her head, yet cannot row a boat or swim when she needs to.
Spike Lee might have had this shelved for a day when he was known as one of the best and would have all the say in his picture.
This was my first Spike Lee experience, and I have to say, I now understand why I'm laughing when comics make jokes such as "That makes about as much sense as a white person's script in a Spike Lee movie" ***SPOILER ALERT **** I thought it was hilarious that the first white man on screen kills himself, and the next white person shown is a complete and utter witch.
No two scenes make sense when put together, the premise about the businessman getting paid $10,000 dollars each time he impregnates a lesbian is preposterous and embarrassingly realized here.
This is when Lee and his collaborator get into the biggest pickle that they can never squirm out of, as up to now they have material that isn't terrific, but has some promise to be developed.
And as depicted in the movie, nowadays, when beauty is there, money is not far away.
I thought you were gaining back your ground when i saw the Summer of Sam.
)-wasn't absurd enough, we then get a subplot about a mafia chieftain whose daughter is one of the clients.He must be the new kinder, gentler form of godfather as he seems to have no problem with his daughter being involved in this.oh yeah, the ladies are worried about disease so they make the main character get tested for everything before the big night, when he has sex with at least 6 women in a row.how do they know the woman went before them was clean?
This movie is at its best when Spike demonstrates that regardless of gender or orientation; insecurity and jealousy are universal.
i recommend " 100th guest special " show ( if u have not seen )bec it is the only show where u can clearly understand how actors are.., i mean he complete mixture of sentiments, humor, professionalism, attitude, he way they were, etc.., and for general audience, it is Aone ENTERTAINMENT, especially when they show JULIA ROBERTS in between smiling, VOW... the amount i like is just doubled like hell, vow, hats off to Julia Roberts, well not only that, u will be finding your own favorite stars doing stuffs like that especially KEVIN SPACEY, STEVEN SPIELBERG, ROBIN WILLIAMS, JERRY LEWIS, man the list goes on...  great TV show - inside the actors studio   inside the actors studio's best - 100 guest special  continue enjoying the show  see u guys...
There are times when I wish I didn't have this determination to finish watching movies, even the abysmally terrible ones.
When Fatima tells Jack she always was a lesbian, even when she was dating him, and was merely in denial, she adds, "And I don't mean a river in Egypt."
It gets even worse, when Lee and co-writer Michael Genet give Brian Dennehy positively laughable dialogue later.
This film was made in the late 1960's, when the Soviet land troops (a so called "Warsaw Pact") was threatening a big part of the world.
These guys are hard-core but when the spotlight of the good-cop, bad-cop is shining on their sorry backside, it is the whole main feature that will give the game away and get you busted, sent-down and sent to solitaryÂ
I didn't feel sad when the movie wanted me to, I didn't laugh when the movie wanted me to, I didn't feel angry or sympathetic to the characters when the movie wanted me to.
Why do I keep saying "when the movie wanted me to" you might ask?
I felt myself laughing at scenes when I was supposed to be feeling something else.
"Dude", "Dawg", "Homey" coming out of a person's mouth 3 or 4 times in a sentence every sentence, makes it very tough to see and not laugh, especially when that person is Christian Bale.
Bale in particular, as always, got the notice of critics when the film hit the festival circuit, and came and went in limited theatrical release late last year.
The actors look like they are struggling to understand their motivations in every scene, and when they are not giving it their all, they just look confused and horrified at the things that are taking place in front of them.
And even when this muddled mess comes to its conclusion, there is still a blatant lack of satisfaction with where it has gone.
And how did they get away with openly breaking countless laws - when most people could never get away with it?
These are the kind of people who make the world a sh*tty place to live in: corrupt, lazy, lying, drinking-while-driving, gun-toting, dope-smoking, misogynistic, anti-intellectual, selfish, ignorant pieces of sh*t. These people corrupt the military, the police force, school-systems, essentially everything they touch, and yet I felt that these characters were being glorified throughout the whole film, except for towards the end when Bale goes nuts; however it is at this point that I felt Rodriguez stepped-up to being the hero.
People are already screaming Oscar-worthy, when the truth of the matter is that at best this movie should have gone straight to DVD, and I'm being generous.
Certainly this isn't the first film to do this, but that makes it even more problematic because by now filmmakers should know what to do and what not to do, particularly when you are working with the slasher genre.
The plot meanders along with no real purpose, even when the killing starts.
It is hardly a swash-buckling tale, it almost put me to sleep and I was overjoyed when it ended.
Funny how people tend to assume that, when two movies on the same subject are released competing with each other, one of them has to be "the good one".
There's some good swordplay involved - particularly when Robin and his men crash Marian's wedding - but in the end it all seemed a little too simple.
In particular, while Robin's victory over Daguerre and Folcanet was accomplished, I was left wondering what was going to happen when King John (OK - Prince John) returned with his troops to collect the taxes.
Heroic rowing star/bootlegger Nicolas Cage is his usual dopey, wooden, charming self, and he has some lively moments, especially when he comes into conflict with the starched shirt types.
Never mind when Pop Colby (Noah Beery, Sr.) shoots Grandpa down in cold blood, Dad Hayden takes an unorthodox and cowardly approach in some eyes, he calls in the law.
The Haydens move west and Colby when he gets out of the joint takes the family and moves to where the Haydens are to take up where they left off.
This is also one of the earliest films of Shirley Temple who's big scene is when one of the Colbys shoots the head off of her doll.
But, when laid beside The Hound of the Baskervilles starring Jeremy Brett, you have a turkey.
They cut to years later when Holmes is a world famous detective and Watson is married and a successful doctor.
Moriarty again comes into Holmes' life when he threatens Prince Alexis with incriminating love letters!
Arthur Conan Doyle must have been spinning in his grave when this came out!
Also he was 40 when he did this--and looks it.
This didn't come as that much of a surprise, though, as when the movie began it said that the film was based on the plays of William Gillette--not the Doyle stories.
However, when those ahead of him are killed unexpectedly, he calls off his upcoming marriage--such a marriage would not be acceptable to the nation.
So imagine the joy when about 600 rolls of work print offcuts (amounting in all to about 4,000 feet) were found!
George Eastman House then came to the rescue when the inter-titles were found in their vaults.
Since when is that cool???????????
c) Since when falls a bourgeoisie-woman for a popstar who is surrounded by groupies?
This hasn't really happened since 1970 when Don Shebib's landmark Canadian film "Going Down the Road" filled us with an extraordinary sense of pride in our Canadian culture.
Telefilm decision makers could not have known, more than three years ago when the film was struggling to overcome all the barriers that make it so hard for independent Canadian films to see the light of day, that this little film would have the phenomenal success it has achieved Â across Canada and in Great Britain, Europe, the United States and the Caribbean.
Apparently they were corrupt FBI agents, so when they were set up and killed, they ended up in the underworld, which is ruled over by Robert Goulet as the Devil.
He's good at droll humor, especially when he gets to play against Busey.
But then are you surprised when you see that the producer is Jerry Bruckheimer, (there is a lot of action), or the director is Joel Schumacher, hardly known for his subtlety in the past or for making films of a 'crusading' nature.
But when Brad get stuck in the game Jack has to follow him in and save him.
No, it's not a exceptionally good film, but what the hell were you thinking when you rented a film starring The Dragon?
Indeed those three movies I often sited as the worst examples of said genre where "Guy ends up playing video game in real life when game comes alive."
Imagine my surprise and my glory when I saw this puppy at my local blockbusters, having appeared out of nowhere.
Granted I have not seen all his movies but for a legendary kick boxer her certainly looks like he can't fight when it comes to his movies.
I wasn't expecting a lot from this when I rented it, but wasn't ready for incredibly bad cinematic cheesefest thrown at me.
He's just left with a bad part, and when his character isn't fighting, all he does is moan about his sons behaviour.
Even when Grandpa shows him this virtual reality game, he just hits out with "There's no way he's going to be playing this".
Somehow, thorough a "hilarious" sequence of accidents, Michael and his business partner are shirtless when 2 Japanese businessmen enter.
It was when Matthew Chambers copies the "I'm watching you" gesture Robert De Niro does in Meet the Parents.
She probably enjoys pretending, but you wonder when she goes out in public where is her self-awareness for herself and her material.
None of the crew is really introduced to us properly, so we don't really care when they die.
A computer that overheats because it doesn't shut down or go to power-save mode when cooling fails.
Alex Garland is a novelist, not a screen writer and this becomes very apparent when looking at his work.
Another idea, when your making a movie stick to one set genre, OK?
But wait, maybe I'm astray, lost from Sunshine's ambitious path...  Not invited by the movie itself, but by a state of boredom, stubbornly still not fully convinced of Sunshine's dark failure I start to wonder about possible philosophical implications the makers may have intended when abandoning simple movie conventions that enable viewers to see what's in front of the camera and to follow what's going on.
That said, I'm pretty generous when it comes to reviewing movies, I can normally look past problems and just get a few laughs, or shocks, or whatever out of a mediocre move and then be happy.
I already knew the story was about the sun going out, but I didn't mind that too much, a movie is allowed to bend physics for the sake of plot, but when a reported brightness increase from 2% to 3.1% changed from a dim glow to blinding white any suspension of disbelief I could have ever attempted was crushed.
these problems ranged from the relatively benign; such as when near the start of the movie a crew member did all the necessary procedures for changing the ship's course entirely on his own, not even asking another crew member to skim his work for problems; to the absolutely ridiculous "We'll cross that bridge when we come to it".
Even then they were "neat" but nothing to write home about, and for those hoping for a fancy flashy colourful special effect when the "Plot Device" activates at the end, there isn't one, seems you just can't win.
computer that will override their vital mission to fix the shield in a vital, life threatening way but it wouldn't bl**dy well make the one point something angle correction to the shield when they changed course in the first place!
(Which thus also endangered the mission) Since when do we let computers make judgment calls?
What was going to protect the bomb when it entered the Sun and the heat could come from behind?
- All remaining plausibility flees at the end, when Capa detonates the bomb and has a leisurely gaze at..what?
And all of you in the cast: How high was the bar tab when you signed on the dotted line...?
It's when Capa makes the decision that they change course for the Icarus I that things start going wrong.
But it's when Sunshine tries to be a psychological-thriller and a sci-fi and a horror flick and an action movie that it all starts to go horribly wrong as a film.
Individually, each graphic trick that Boyle tries looks really, really cool and usually flows properly but when he throws them into the movie like Picasso throws paint, it gets very tiring awfully quickly.
There were immediate problems from the very beginning (such as using a calm voice when it should be awed, and the exact opposite as regards the music), but I liked the fact that none of the crew members were either particularly heroic or evil, but just ordinary people.
will plummet when more people (such as actual SF fans, and people who're not friends of the the director) see it.
Then, later, when he and Capa and another of the Icarus II's hapless crew must execute an ill-advised human-cannon trick between two crippled airlocks (a situation that falls squarely between "Don't ask."
As in, a computer that talks to you and calls you by name and yet can't tell you when half your spaceship has just caught on fire?
Selective flammability: Not only do Capa and the film's Mystery Slasher not burn up when Capa, hoping to effect a desperate getaway, yells "Full sunlight!"
By comparison, when the show's nutter psychologist (again: don't ask) tries the "full sunlight" thing, he burns up just fine, thank you.
It's a split: Chris Evans, who tries so desperately to be the voice of reason (if only for a moment) on this ship of fools, and Underworld and John Murphy, who were obviously watching a much more intelligent, moving, and dramatic film when they concocted the score.
It's low-budget dreck, that is certain--but through its persistent incoherence, it kept my attention, even though the one feeling I had when the credits started to roll was absolute indifference.
Now I feel that I have to be a little more choosy when I see a Jeffery Combs movie on the shelf.
I still remember a scene in which the female leader character was talking about her rape when she was a child and she defines the raper as "The soft man", everybody laughed at that and the dubbing of the Spanish actress Monica Van Campen was so ridiculous that again everybody laughed when she talked (Despite her undoubtful beauty.
Naturally, Jaspers jumps at the chance to sell his soul for revenge, but he later regrets it when he turns into a horned demon...
It reminds one how shallow are the "reality" TV shows when art can imitate life in such a telling fashion.
Divoff has a chick by his side, Claire(MÃ²nica Van Campen, melts fervent heat right from the screen) always trying to seduce someone into robbing her master of his power since Lucifer's human shell is weakening(..I don't know, ask those who made this damn thing what the point is of Lucifer staying in a weak body when he should be able to invade many of those who worship him).
Tougher, more realistic westerns were just around the corner (Ford's "My Darling Clementine", Gregory Peck's "The Gunfighter" and James Stewart's collaborations with Anthony Mann, to name but a few examples) and Cooper was to find his last great role when he eschewed the overdone country hick in favour of the dignified seriousness of the marshal in the classic "High Noon".
I had the album when it came out, but the movie never played anywhere near me.
I did not get to see this movie when it came out.
He displays none of the energy and humor which so defines his music, even when lip-synching to his own songs.
Waldemar Daninsky (Paul Naschy) also used to be Countess Bathory's loyal servant when they were executed several hundred years earlier for their gruesome crimes.
THE CRAVING, when it was released in the states was horribly butchered because of its violent content.
A batsman described as left-handed but depicted otherwise, fielders described as leg fielders moving to the offside when the opposite is the case, etc.
Come to think of it, the men in the film often come across as boys, particularly when in the presence of the women in their lives (whether wife, girlfriend or mother).
One vampiress is constantly complaining that she can't go play on the beach or get a sun tan, but when the orgy scene comes up, she's got giant tan lines.
This was the routine EVERY Foghorn Leghorn cartoon followed and I have never liked, even when I was a little kid.
But when the military appear, the whole storyline collapses.
I hated that Gail's parents couldn't bring themselves to tell her she was adopted, how Gail's adopted mother told the birthmother that her other two children "were their own", Gail's look of icky disgust when her birthmother was lower-middle-class (Gail looked at the woman as if she had leprosy), the fact that the birthmother was portrayed as common, and the snippiness of both the adoptive mother and the 16-year-old sister.
Meanwhile Natalie Wood has all but disappeared from the story, and when we finally do get to see her again she is no longer the yakkity funny little pest, but reflective and quietly concerned about her sister's state of mind.
She suffers silently with the shocking news of her adoption until one night, after an ugly (by her standards) meeting with her natural mother, she stays out late and when she comes home her father asks, "Do you know what your mother has been going through?"
The only ENDEARING quality I can give the movie is that Colleen Rennison makes the Olsen twins look like something out of a Wal-Mart circular, but it's not worth seeing the movie when you can see her cameos in great T.V.
I thought such subplots were dumb when I was young enough to appreciate family movies.
So when a big city revenuer asks for Gator's help, what choice does he have?
Gator gets something else he hadn't counted on, however, when he falls for television reporter Aggie Maybank (Lauren Hutton).
There are times in Gator when Reynolds and Reed are on screen together that I swear it's like a test run for Smokey and the Bandit.
I was really looking forward to seeing this when I 1st heard it was on TV.
Another weak point is the original music, (a failing also of the much later "Dreamgirls") which especially when set against contemporary classic tracks by The Who, Kinks and Mamas and Papas, to name but a few, is sorely lacking in catchiness and leaves you wondering just how The Stray Cats actually got to the top of the charts.
Even after "Scotty Farkus" had been burned hard by a casting agent he still believed that a shady guy from "back East" was going to fund their movie and were shocked when it turned out he was just snowing them.
This show is a piece of trash,I hate it when people try to tell you what to do and how you live your life.It is cloths people,wear what you want.If you like it and it fells good than power to you.Yes,there is some place where you have dress codes.There should be no rules in they why you present your self,express yourself they way you like.The one thing I hate is that women Stacy,she seams to be very uptight and make very rude comments.So,what if the cloths do not fit her shape.if the girl like it than power to her.Clinton is OK but some times he kind of sounds to posh and act like he is the cream Dee la cream.The other thing is that some of the cloths are far too darn expensive.No one is going to buy a skirt that cost a person $500 dollars.no one can afford it.A person beauty is in the inside , not because she wears the latest designer cloths.At the end of the day beauty is in the eye of the beholder.Sorry but Stacy and Clinton get faces out of TV.We need to except people for who they are and what they like.
and I get frightened when I think of what those two would put me in.
The music in this movie sets the tone like it should, but also reveals when something isn't right - a good tool when figuring out the plot in advance.
The ending is expected as you will see when you watch Wicked Minds.
Normally I'll hang in there, especially when I'm watching a movie at home, since I can fast forward, but even that didn't seem like an option.
Andrew "Dice" Clay has been called a lot of things in his life, I'm sure, but when he was called "a comedian", I'm also sure that was said with condescending laughter, snickers and Bronx cheers aplenty.
Where Larry can make a redneck smile when he sees the couch on his lawn, it's hard to shake the idea that that same redneck is going to some home from a Dice Clay show and, y'know, beat his wife.
Every shot of a woman in the crowd is not one of laughter or genuine amusement, but more like they've got egg on their face, like they can't believe he said that, or that, or that, and they're worried that they're getting kicked in the stomach when they get home as her husband obsessively repeats his nursery rhymes and calls her a pig and a baboon.
It's funny, there's nothing lazier than a Nazi comparison when it's something you don't like, but for once, the comparison is eerily sensible.
What was Andrew Dice Clay thinking when he decided to film this inexcusable piece of garbage.
I saw this movie when it came out in the theaters and I was a fan of the Donnie & Marie Show...However, even though I was only 15 when I saw it, I was shocked and disappointed at how bad this film was.
Wow, I can recall this movie when it came out, but never did get a chance to see it.
In one scene, when Donny is pointing out to Marie someone who might have been one of the criminals chasing them in an earlier scene, she says she can't see them because she's not wearing her glasses?
Having seen episodes 5 and 6 from my local library (And also some scattered episodes from when I was small), I decided to pick this one up as well, thinking it was the End of Evangelion (It was wrongly labeled by the library, despite how obvious it wasn't from the big words DEATH AND REBIRTH on the cover).
The veracity Mitsukos horrific ordeal is challenged when, the possibility is raised that these events are fictional; taken from the manuscript of a controversial horror authors latest book.
and death has now become a metaphor for Game Over, so now, when a filmmaker reaches into their bag of handy shocks there is little left.
I believe that Sion Sono does a great disservice to genuine survivors of abuse when he presents Mitsuko in such a simplified manner.
But, when he visits his mansion, Fenton is chased off the property, by interloping inhabitants.
The Australian waterfront had been virtually held to ransom for years with one of the lowest lift-rates of any OECD nation, workers with "go slow" policies in order to gain valuable overtime rates, but which miraculously disappeared when the right hands were greased, and a unhelpful union intent on waging an "us vs them" battle of ideology against any sort of attempt to change a status quo that wasn't working.
well, in this movie when that stuff happened i just shook my head--most of the time they didn't have any diegetic justification for their plot twists--and rolled my eyes.
I think here also you are better off waiting for a few months by when this should be coming on channels.
In the climax when a gang of people reach the house and following them is a police team it might have neared 35 that's it and for most of the movie it is 15 people.
A particularly bad scene is when Donald Pleasance is telling someone something, and then they cut the scene and he finishes the sentence several minutes later!
I hope I'm not bumbing against people's cart when I say that with having just watched PHANTOM OF DEATH his directorial skills somewhat became a bit more questionable again to me.
Now, when you're wildly shooting a movie in a jungle, you can get away with that and the audience just doesn't notice it.
But when you're shooting a stylish crime thriller and trying to tell a decent story, then you better fine-tune your directing skills in that department too.
Michael York somehow does pull it off on some level, but his character is loaded with so much pathos - man, those scenes when he's talking to the blind dog - that it sometimes becomes painful to watch.
This scene, in the actual film itself, is no longer than the footage seen in the trailer - which, when I viewed it, certainly intrigued me.
It definitely doesn't say life or youth ends when your hair go off but it says that some things should be understood not by experience but for example by other people around us or art depicting these things.
For instance, when they ruthlessly make fun of Meatloaf's "I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)", they say it doesn't make sense - what won't he do?
The performances did nothing to engender the glowing reminiscence of movies watched when I was a child.
There is little sex to speak of and when there is its not sexy, its actually funny.
i think the second Die Hard was strong also, but when the wife's character disappeared, a lot of the heart was lost.
That is to say that they cannot cause even a ripple of mirth now, and it surprises me that they would have done when they were filmed.
As for the "Confessions" films, not one of them should raise a laugh at any stage, and it really does seem barely credible that standards of decency and morality have dropped so far that most people nowadays would find it hard to credit that these were X rated films when they were made.
I got maybe 25-30 minutes into the thing when I just couldn't take it and stopped watching.
The music is bad too, and just when you thought it couldn't get worse, the lousy ending seals the deal shut.
Usually I like that kind of thing, as when Elmer Fudd defies gravity.
The best scene is when Belial gets busy with a set of scalpels and plants them in the female doctor's face.
This is when you think it can't have been a True Story because it starts to get into the realms of fiction with plots and subplots based on the storyline of a woman lusting after her lawyer who tells her he's happily married.We find out later he DID once have an affair which nearly destroyed him.
It just seems as if the plot is being added to when the woman employs a hit man to bump the lawyers wife off after arranging to have his nightclub torched.It gets too silly I was glad when it finished the film overstayed its welcome by about an hour
But when malicious gossip endangers the peace of mind and the social status of a heretofore upstanding citizen, we must wonder about it.
I should have suspected something when I kept trying to determine whether I had stepped into something on the way home from Blockbuster only to realize that the odour was emanating from my blockbuster bag.
I think that it was very shocking when it came in the cinemas but now with knowing what happens, this film is nothing but a big joke.
And when it happens there is no reason for watching the film anymore.
You think about why doesn't he leave this pervert or when he doesn't how they are going to have sex.
And even when you don't know what will happen, which you now know because I said it, it is also not worth the time.
The end of the movie when they are all on the boat and they are talking about fiction and non fiction seemed to me like the director was explaining that in reality the way the movie was played out is the way it would happen in real life and not how most standard horror movies play out.
In fact, when I left the theater, I found myself feeling an overwhelming sense of disgust with both the film maker and the audience!
Imagine my absolute horror when members of the audience, and in particular, female members of the audience, could be heard laughing hysterically.
For instance, at one point one of the characters talks directly to the camera (and of course, by extension, us); at another, one of the characters when the victims rise up (as one would naturally expect after they KILLED THEIR LITTLE BOY!!!)
manages to rewind the action when it is unfavorable, and alter it so that the husband is shot dead, and the wife is bound and dropped into the lake.
But when you look at the brevity of the film, and the amount of cinema time actually wasted, it just didn't seem to add up.
The word "relentless" is usually associated with movies when giving a positive review.
Strangely that works out perfectly and we get to know everything about it, even though the movie actually doesn't spend much time explaining, it's just done so well and perfectly direct that we basically know everything about these two when the movie ends.
Not even when suffering from extreme sleeplessness in hopes that this might lull you into a restful slumber - trust me it won't.
I was being nice when I gave this two stars - Watch at your own peril and remember you'll never be able to reclaim the two hours of your life.
But when the two boys begin obviously antagonizing her, she realizes that their family is about to be taken hostage for a terrifying night of anything but "funny" games.
The most important aspect of this film when judging it is meant to be unconventional.
Although the movie fulfills its aims in its unconventionality, what we are left with when all the conventions are broken is only the shell of a great movie.
A film can seek to chase beauty, tell a story, delight viewers, convey a message, play on a theme, or invoke an emotion, but when a film does none of these it loses its value as a piece of art.
If you take someone's brain fluid, and then inject the brain fluid into your bloodstream (intravenously) then you might have a heart attack when the heart cannot filter the brain fluid, but I do not see how injecting brain fluid into your arm is going to cause anyone to relive the memories of the person whose brain fluid was injected.
Why does Linda continue to hang around when Ray basically USED her to get to her wonder drug, and he certainly never even gives her a kiss or even says he likes her!
Ray reminds me of Joe Cocker when he is singing.
In 1916, when he switched to Mutual Studios, his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy--in many of the previous films he was just a jerk (either getting drunk a lot, beating up women, provoking fights with innocent people, etc.).
After many years have passed I have to say that this movie kept me hanging as it did when I watched it was seems now like ages ago.
Unfortunately, when neither the plot nor the characters give us a reason to care, thrills alone cannot carry a film.
For instance (spoiler coming) at the very beginning of it, the psychological expert tells us about how, when a person sees her or his doppelganger, double, it's an omen of death.
When I saw KÃ´rei I've already seen the very interesting KaÃ¯ro, also by Kiyoshi Kurosawa; after that positive impression had someone told me that Mr. Kurosawa was capable of clumsiness when dealing with a fantastic story I wouldn't lend him or her ears, but unfortunately that would be true.
When I'm seeing a movie or reading a story I can suspend my feeling of disbelief and believe in a ghost, I don't have problems with unreality, whereas I cannot believe when the characters in a story abruptly and against their own psychology, start to act the opposite way they would.
Of course, you always can stop the DVD player when the display shows you 42 minutes; you'll be sparing yourselves the disappointment of seeing how the very decent first part of this movie helplessly wrecks.
And when it was over you felt like all you did was watch nothing evolve into nothing.
The  finale, when the criminal and friends are trapped in the woods, is  equally puzzling.
It's always a good thing when movies use real Indians instead of actors that are painted up to look like Indians.
If you're looking for a movie to watch when you're really feeling like simple humor and not too much thinking to do, this is it, else don't do it because you won't survive for an hour and a half.
Also there are more and more inconsistencies in the power of Peter Petrelli (replicating other's power) which is automatic when needed by the script (regeneration, be invisible, becoming radioactive etc..) and inoperative when really useful (replicating Sylar's powers at first, second or even third encounter, time travel from Hiro and so on) and not to mention that he never uses the ones he really need when he needs them (unlike Sylar), why did it take him the last episode to listen to anyone's mind (aside from the accidental encounter with Parkman), and why does he need his brother to fly him and play the firework while he can fly all by himself (his first ever duplicated power).
The cheap fight against Sylar, and the first few images of the teaser of the second season don't reassure me with the potential disappearance of Sylar's body in the sewage (how the Hell could anyone let him move even an inch) or Hiro in Medieval ClichÃ© type Japan....  Watch it when you really don't have anything better to do and watch Battlestar Galactica instead if you look for the best TV series ever (who said I'm subjective)
Right now, when I'm writing this, I've already decided to quit watching 'Heroes'.
Anyway, one of the show's biggest problems became obvious in th finale, when all the character came together for a mostly underwhelming showdown.
Somehow, Heroes was best when it did not follow closely to a plan, but allowed its characters some room to develop naturally.
It all grew naturally, and lost its momentum only when everything was yanked back into the intended showdown.
Had I known that from the start, I wouldn't have bothered - I started watching when he described the show to be about "ordinary people across the globe".
The flying guy seems like he would be the exception.... but when he spends every scene TRYING to remember to talk out of the side of his mouth (copying Jennifer Anistons manufactured facial tick???
My mom was just absolutely in love with this film and told me how much I should see it if I love action movies, also I had become a Bruce Willis fan, so when she mentioned that, I decided to sit down and watch it.
When John comes to see his wife, Holly, at her office building during the company Christmas party, he asks if he can be given a second chance, but that gets slightly interrupted when terrorists enter the building.
Next week, you've lost interest and when it returns, it spends twenty minutes recapping what happened last week as the show seems to think it's viewers have the memory span of a fish, then the exciting discovery to see whether or not a character is dead or not (which you could really care less by then) is finished and the party continues at a lagging speed, until it repeats itself over and over again...
Nikki also became popular with the men, probably because of that lovely crotch shot in the first episode, so they continued on her dull struggle to keep from becoming her alter ego, take care of her son and to not go to jail, when they finally put her in there, she murders some couple guards or something, and then... they release her!
Also, the show attempts to run four plots at once in one episode, which gets quite confusing and frustrating when one plot gets interesting and they flick to... say... Mohinder looking through books or something irritating.
I tune in for a good laugh at how crappy the content can get, and I'm amazed when the viewers actually find something to theorize about- why bother as it's probably going to be explained... Usually they're right though, but as all fingers pointed to the conclusion...
The other one is in THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON, when George C. Scott (as General Patton) makes his SINGING DEBUT by performing the the suggestively dirty little soldier's ditty "Lily From Piccadilly, The Blackout Queen".
The next hour is filled with tedious scenes as we get needless character development when what we want is to be scared.
I had seen the beginning of this movie when i was a lot younger on television.
So when i saw this movie on the shelf in the video store a few months ago, they had just re-released it on DVD due to the remake being in theaters at the time i quickly picked it up.
Thankfully, the film returns to its frightening pace at the end, when the now married Jill Johnson once again encounters Curt Duncan.
Another let down with "When A Stranger Calls" comes when we finally see Curt Duncan face to face.
Mister Michael Jordon) when he puts on his magic shoes(that may have been owned by a young MJ) and goes on the basketball court.
He doesn't talk very much, only when it serves his own purposes.
Not to talk about the camera work (probably a first time operator, at least I hope so), although the "day for night" they invented for this movie is shockingly interesting (I understood this only after the first half of the movie and when I mentioned it to the others watching the movie I could see that no one had understood the purpose of this strange color effects before).
There was a time when Franco at least tried to make entertaining movies - always sloppy (he'd shoot lots of loose footage, then resell/repackage the same stuff to different distributors under different titles); but this is even worse than Lust For Frankenstein - just a cheap amateur whack-job shot on camcorder by high school students.
There comes a point in every man's life when he must decide whether to gouge out his own eyes with a dull and fiery hot spoon ... or watch this movie.
It scares me when I see people rave on and on about how great this is.
In fact, the script writers contradict themselves near the end of the film when the two leads do everything in their power to desert one another.
The final fight is laughable when two siamese twins (connected at the back) grab hold of one of the protagonists and bounce around the room like a superball.
When this one is aired, pass this by or hold your nose when viewing.
This movie star Elden Henson as the boy with disturb past and Kieran Culkin as the disable boy, they two become friend and that when imaginary adventure begin.
Less importantly, I can't figure out why Sharon Stone is the number one credit when the story isn't really about her character.
However, there were a few scenes that just felt overly tense, such as when--possible spoilers--Kevin begins choking on his food and loses consciousness, when Max learns of Kevin's death (which is more disturbing than emotional), and even the scene where Loretta is strangled (but not killed), which is otherwise understandable.
McClane is a NYPD cop who came to L.A. to visit his wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), but he was able to escape himself from the terrorists when they invaded the building.
At first I was intrigued when I saw the posters advertising the show.
But when I looked up the creators I found that one of the guys was responsible for Evelyn: the Cutest Evil Dead Girl, a short film whose style was obviously taken from Tim Burton, and concept was lifted wholesale from Roman Dirge's comic Lenore: the Adventures of a Cute Little Dead Girl.
So when I finally saw the show, I was watching with lowered expectations.
For at least the first 10 minutes of Don't Trip, I was trying to figure out what the hell the deal was--I felt like I had stumbled into a timeshare sales pitch or multi-level marketing meeting by accident--when you know there's some ulterior motive occurring, and this isn't just a collection of more or less random people interacting in a general way.
And a couple times, when Harvey got serious, I thought he had something valuable to say (such as the speech about not discouraging your children's ambitions).
This time he acquires a pretty lady (Rochelle Hudson) when he commandeers her car, and she's almost a match for him.
Ha, ha, little girls, we'll talk when you can tell the difference between love and infatuation.
It's just stupid teenage melodramatic bull, aren't you supposed to go through that stuff when you're like 14?
The trader comes up with an outrageous high number of cows and shocks the town when he arrives with all healthy and the full number of cows he promised.
Another example is when the animals perform various comic scenes of stopping forest destruction (both inside and outside forest), but with the more serious intentions of saving their home in mind.
This is one of those type of movies you watch, and when you leave you get pissed at the movie theater employees, even though they relatively had nothing to do with why you're mad.
And he was so good when he started.
At this point they send someone up to take him out, and the person ends up getting killed, John having a wicked sense of humour (on both levels of the word) sends the dead body down the lift and takes as much as he can like the machine gun, and cigarettes as you do when your in that sort of situation, and tries on the shoes only to find they are too small.
I could talk for days about this film and it's action sequences from the very small gun fights to the massive C4 explosion and the plot which doesn't seem to lose it's appeal even after watching it infinite times, and also it's feel good factor at the end when John is back with Holly and they are in the snow (lets face it you knew they would live) but it's got something that does make you want to watch it over and over.
When you see a movie for the first time, it is usually good, but when a part two is released I become a skeptic about weather or not the sequel will be any good.
So when I heard about the sequel I couldn't wait for the DVD.
I actually had high hopes for this movie when watching it in the cinema at a film festival in Copenhagen, the director Amirkulov was also present at the viewing, so it felt like a special occasion.
Watching him work a case is just painful, especially when he does the big reveal at the end.
Cop shows have all been the same, when one ends there's a new one in a season or two that does the same thing the same way with no imagination or originality.
The main character, Detective Robert Goren, is all-wise, all-knowing, can give a psychiatric diagnosis in an instant, finds clues right away, regularly breaks suspects when there is no evidence available, etc.
People remember the things on the walls from when they were 12?
We hated it that when a character, inside a haunted building, sees a kid with blood trickling down his forehead, extends his arm to the kid and says "It's okay!"
Jesse (Jonathon Trent) has always been interested in the hotel & drawn to the mystery surrounding the still unsolved murders, he has convinced some of his high school mates to accompany him, during the middle of the night of course because going there during the day when it was light would just be silly.
Also it turns out that whatever the victim was trying to hide they hid inside an nearby air vent so when they were killed how could they have been trying to hide something when they had clearly already hidden it?
The film seems to take itself very seriously & there's no humour or fun to be seen anywhere which doesn't help when the plot feels so stale & lethargic.
I was also going to bring the James Bond franchise into the conversation but the series became a parody when Bond stopped speaking with a Scottish accent sometime in the early 70s  DIE HARD is different to the other 80s action fests with John McLane being a fairly believable genre character .
And the knife at end, what are the odds you would find one just when you need one?
There's not enough action or character analysis here to make this film anything but an exercise from Miike, which while I'm sure was a good workout for him, leaves the viewer with little else to say, except it was kinda neat when the character's sprouted wings, a non too subtle metaphor for their rebirth as "heroes".
I had noticed that for a big budget production it received ZERO Oscar nominations when they pretty much nominated every film that was released.
Then Twinkle sees and chases Rose round a bush, and when he gets to her father, he will only allow a marriage if he proves himself as a provider of fish.
A fun game, but it shows just how far Sierra has come when you look at King's Quest V and up.
Since when did Recce planes carry bombs and what about the flagrant disregards of any orders !!!!
(Talking of worse, the Italian and original title of the movie refers to the Ardennes-since when has Amsterdam, Holland, where the film is set, been anywhere near the bleedin Ardennes?...oh lord)
The annoying part in the movie that I'm sure never happened in real life was everybody going around hollering "How'that going to look when you do that?"
Some shots are clearly ripped from the first one, like the liquid nitrogen demonstrations and when the leader dude stands in front of the japan flag & his "army".
Why they need to research what happens when they do this, I don't know, but anyway, the hero reluctantly fires at the commander's order, naturally killing them, then looks shocked and horrified at the results.
Speaking of that, there's another scene where the prisoners are all in one room with huge numbers on their uniforms so large that the digits would be visible from another planet, and when they need them for experiments, a guard just walks in with a clipboard and calls out their numbers, and they call out "here!"
Two star-crossed lovers finally come to their senses when they are reminded about the lives they are ruining with their carrying-ons.
The Marquis has gambled the Di Fiore's family money away and by marrying one of their daughters off to a sick looking Dracula they think they will inherit his money when he dies.
There's a lot of naked flesh and sex on show, the girls even go topless when gardening.
There are only three gore scenes in the whole film, two scenes where Kier violently throws up impure blood and when Dracula is gorily killed at the end with an axe.
Andy Warhol as mentioned in other reviews had very little to do with the film, he was quoted when asked of his involvement that he went to the parties.
(the green light they shine on Drac's face when he realized the blood he's just sucked out of another pathetic daughter's neck is kinda funny, tho.
The movie's not funny when it wants to be funny, and it's funny when it's supposed to be 'serious'.
That is to say that any portrayal is not necessarily wrong, as there are no set teachings in what is right and what is wrong when practising the craft.
So to the person who said it was totally incorrect when the bird is stabbed with the needle as Wicca doesn't do it, no.
The first is when Kidman is saying that her boyfriend is from Bulgaria: "close to Transilvania... he's got the whole Dracula-cowboy thing going on".
I really hate when films from the USA get such basically simple but fundamental things such as geography wrong.
The second thing in the film, which is more of a goof... when Sandra Bullock had to go and rescue Nicole Kidman, the aunts were going to take the kids to the Solstic Celebrations.
This sort of statement activates my baloney barometer, but I felt better when I saw David Yallop credited as scriptwriter.
i was amazed when the credits rolled.
I saw it when I was 7 or 8 in a theater for a birthday party.
It felt at some points that is is a porno film, but when any girl got half naked the scene ended.
His best known comeback was in 1997, when he re-emerged into the A-list spotlight with "Boogie Nights".
But the problem comes when she expresses her objection to strippers playing volleyball, since that would bring the wrong kind of exposure to the sport.
I reiterate when I say that Burt Reynolds should probably get a new agent, because he has been in and can be in better movies.
Fellini exposes his great attraction for the clowns and the world of the circus first recalling a childhood experience when the circus arrives nearby his home.
Honestly, my favorite part of the series was when the middle break for advertising shows the returning segment....if you time it just right, you can make a fart sound just as her skirt lifts to show the logo on her butt cheek.
Becoming involved in his duties well beyond the operation and maintenance of his mini-company's surveillance equipment, Will is delighted as Nikki ostensibly matches his passion, as is evident from a cluster of scenes wherein the two explore each other's private areas, but complications appear when murder, rape and sundry other felonies occur in conjunction with their affair, Will being the primary suspect for the crimes.
"Die Hard" is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly.
The environments also look amazing, especially when the human world comes into play.
However, the director deliberately complicates the film when, by trying to achieve suspense, he keeps viewers guessing about the chronology of events, drops new characters into scenes without introducing them, only for you to discover the identity of the characters several scenes later.
There were the numerous battles over ships, the ships he won through those battles, the smoking hat when he boarded a ship and the fact that he was caught in a sandbar in the Pamplico Sound while trying to flee from Lt. Maynard.
Note this people I wasn't expecting much when I started watching this "film" and I use the term loosely, I just expected at least a history channel esq documentary at best, but instead I got a Pirates of the Caribbean rip off.
I was put off right at the beginning by Edward Teach (Blackbeard) having a Scottish accent when of course he was English.
The film still is all about the images though, and right from the start you know it's a Tsukamoto when you see his trademark: Maggots eating some rotten flesh.
Now knowing these things, when I saw ads for this movie I was eagerly anticipating this movie.
I dread to think how much money was wasted on this when there are fantastic scripts waiting to be made for a fraction of the cost.
Thank god I didn't buy it, although when i'm on my death bed and cannot stay awake long enough to say my farewells to my grandchildren, and children so forth I will remember that this was the 87 min of my life i'm never getting back !
In my opinion, the movie gets even worse when you figure out that you have seen it all before.
Just because you don't figure out the killer, doesn't make it a plot-twist when you find out who it is.
When the father passes away, there is much mourning, and then when the mother arises to use the bathroom in the middle of the night she encounters a VERY strange character that literally scares the life out of her.
John Wayne had been making low budget movies for almost 15 years when he starred with Claire Trevor in the William Seiter directed "Allegheny Uprising".
The younger John Wayne was much better when paired with talented leading ladies like Ella Raines and Cecilia Parker.
I can live with bad movies, but when it's a bad sequel to a bad original, than apparently the makers choose not to learn.
Even when it's your own movie and you're proud of it, you just have to admit that the original was a bad film.
It's like listening to a kazoo for 90 minutes - even when it's skillfully played, there's just too much synth, and it's way too insistent.
It's shocking when junk like this gets made- there have to be one hundred worthy scripts out there that are better then this.
As someone who loves straight-to-DVD movies like CAMP BLOOD and BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE, I was expecting another "so-bad-it's-good" movie in a similar vain when I put SERIAL SLAYER into my DVD player.
Just when it appears that something interesting is transpiring, the action comes to a halt and the seemingly never-ending boring conversations between the 3 main characters resume.
Judith O'Dea of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD fame must have really needed some money to supplement her retirement pension when she made this because this is the most embarrassing production any actress of her ilk could have appeared in.
The front cover of the DVD bares no resemblance to anything in the movie at all...the killer when revealed looks about as convincing as...well...something not very convincing...all in all a totally ghastly load of rubbish that's worth watching to see how not to make a movie... every single thing that you could do wrong is included in this film.
when their friend was attacked, they did NOTHING but let her sit in another room.
finally when one girl miraculously escapes the Wal-mart killer, she doesn't run to a neighbors house to tell them that this crossbow killer is on her roof, no she runs down the street past dozens of houses and stumbles across a guy and says "um, there's um, been an um, accident".
The only thing that really gave me a laugh was when the zombies were on the loose in the mall.
The problem with the movie though is that it takes itself too seriously when it's obvious it benefitted the most from the unintentional comedy.
Dunno...She and the "heroine" - the prostitute who begged her for help in the nightclub - sit huddled together listening to the driving rain (it wasn't raining when they entered the brothel), talking as if they were old friends.
Sutekichi is essentially responsible for the deaths of their parents, but his ulterior motive is re-entering the life of Rin(RyÃ´)who was once his lover and partner in the slums, with them separated after their thievery leads to possible trouble for the troupe when a man comes seeking revenge for what they did to his family after stealing jewels.
Choosing the mayor, symbolically siding with the higher class instead of the poor, Yukio will swallow a bitter pill when his brother takes him away from the comforts of living, placing him in a horrifying situation of confinement, hunger, and filth..there seems to be no escape as he looks up at his brother, who teases about ruining his practice and making love to his wife.
As always Tsukamoto brings an uneasy atmosphere and the character arcs are stunning to behold, exploring the psychological terrain of what can transform a person when placed in a difficult situation(..all the three of the principals)whether it be for the betterment or detriment of their existence.
Every killing is in slow motion and when the lady is being kidnapped she doesn't even try to escape.
If you pay more than $5 to own a DVD of this movie by itself, you will probably be looking around for a throat to slit when it is over.
That's what Shore figures when his mother Shelley Winters and her long time boyfriend Charles Napier get married and he's at loose ends.
Whalen is accused of butchering and dismembering several fast food managers when he's found sleeping at the place their bodies were stashed.
I first saw this movie when I was in grade school, so naturally I wasn't too critical.
There is a scene early on in "Jury Duty" when Pauly Shore stands on a bus and imitates a town tour guide.
The effect of the sound plus the image is a sense of dread and unease even when there is nothing out of the ordinary in the frame, few thrillers or horror films have ever been able to make you feel so off by doing so little.
In war ravaged England the two of them begin an affair only for Ms. Kerr to end it in thanks to the Lord when Maurice (Johnson) survives a bombing.
Then, when they meet in a restaurant, he tells her right away that he saw her kissing another man.
In addition Johnson is swanning in and out of Kerr's house, sometimes when the husband comes home.
I particularly disliked the characterisation of the relationship between Holmes and Watson - it seemed that Holmes held Watson permanently in contempt which is not something that I felt when reading the stories.
I sort of thought I was in for disappointment when they completely left out the analysis of Dr Mortimer's cane.
When he sticks to the original - such as when Holmes identifies the culprit from an ancient portrait - the film intermittently feels on target.
Roxburgh's Holmes is blond, bland and lacking in much charisma, which is painfully obvious when he's in his scenes against wily Richard E. Grant's Stapleton.
Supporting players come off best - Aussie Matt Day makes an appealingly naive Canadian Sir Henry Baskerville; Ron Cook is a nicely mysterious Barrymore; lovely Neve McIntosh is a Beryl Stapleton work sinking into the Grimpen Mire for, and Grant pretty much makes his scenes endurable when nothing else does.
Best of all the Hound ,when eventually seen, is obviously an import from "The Lost World" looking as it does a cross between a sabre toothed tiger and a crocodile.
Then things started going wrong big time when there was a party at Baskerville Hall, mmm this never happened.
With all displays of Holmes' deductive reasoning dropped (even the famous scene with Dr Mortimer's walking stick is gone), his disguises omitted (he just appears on the moor as if he were still dressed for Baker Street) and his drug use wildly overdone (rather than resorting to narcotics when bored, he even jacks up in a public toilet while working on the case in this version), he's such a blunt bull in a China shop here that rather than pay the cabby for information, he beats him up instead as if he were a 19th century Popeye Doyle.
Although I did enjoy this movie 30 years ago, I can't say I echo Bob's sentiments today, but I laughed along with him when it came out in 1977.
First, he changed the setting of the period-piece from the Showa era (1920s), to the late Meiji era when poverty was more-obvious in Japanese society.
For example, BROTHERHOOD OF DEATH is much worse when it comes to acting and production values.
A doctor today might push some unnecessary pills on you so that s/he will get some money from the drug company, but they would never go so far as to guarantee you are cured of syphilis and can now freely have sex with people when you actually weren't cured at all.
I love the assumption abstinence-only supporters make: that when you're married, you won't catch STDs.
It's unlikely that anyone reading this was even alive seventy years ago when the film was made, and that in itself is a remarkable testament to the staying power of a cult classic from a bygone era.
So when I watched LEATHERFACE TCM 3, I was underwhelmed.
The only part of this film I truly enjoyed was a darkly humorous scene in which Leatherface is playing with an electronic children's toy, and becomes frustrated when it shows him a picture of a clown, asks him what it is, and keeps telling him his answer of "food" is wrong.
They make the unwise decision of taking the route and end up with their car broken down and a giant guy with a chainsaw and poor manners when it comes to greeting guests on their tail.
I suppose it is a sad commentary on pop culture when the gruesome acts of despicable people on film has become so blasÃ© as to be boring, but that is where it stands.
It's not exciting when a movie is in a constant climax.
The ending made no sense when Ken Fore's character died by Leatherface in the pond and had his head cut off by the chainsaw.
Unfortunately, like all cave men epics, its hard to maintain any sort of pace when the people mostly fight, grunt and fight some more.
The conflict arises when the son of the king of Goona arrives by canoe, waving the white-wing of peace, to warn Wongo of the arrival of the Monkey Men from the sea.
I know that when I first heard of the title I couldn't rest till it was part of my library.
I'm always a bit leery when the opening credits signal the use of Pathecolor, for some reason a particular range of the color spectrum will dominate.
That's when they fall prey to the Wongo women and their snare traps.
Yes, that obligatory scene is presented when things get a little out of hand with Wana, she's the free thinker who wants to break ranks with leader Ooma.
I see three thousand copies of Dude, Where's My Car every time I step outside, but when I want to see a beautiful and interesting film like Gemini, I have to track down a dubious bootleg on eBay.
The most amazing sequence of this movie is undoubtedly this one: All the women of Wongo reach ecstasy when the High-Priestess performs her pagan Dance of the Dragon-God.
But be cautious when going into this one... some male persons easily susceptible to brain-damage might end up repeating the line "Me man!
This film must have been a great after midnight third feature in the drive-ins when folks could look at the Guna men and Wongo women if they needed a little extra inspiration for the night's fun.
There's a parrot who serves as a kind of Greek chorus to all the silly goings on and when the parrot gives the best acting performance in the film, you KNOW how bad this is going to be.
This all changes when one of the young men of Goona, the son of that islands king,traveled to Wongo by canoe to get the men of both islands to united against an invasion of ape-men from another island.
This was foiled by the Wongo women when they prevented their men from murdering the handsome Noona man which had them kicked out of the island by their man-folks.
They all live happily ever after with Mother Nature as usual correcting herself from the mistake she made when she at first created the incompatible, to each other, men and women of Wongo and Goona.
Why make any concessions to conservation of biomass when you can't breed up a viable population from two individuals anyway?
I actually expected something when I saw that Kal Penn (he was in one of my favorite comedies, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle) so I viewed it.
The film makers spent like a year pointlessly trying to whip up laughable script jokes to entertain the audience, when in the actual film, they ended up not delivering.
Yep, the time when Disco forged an unholy alliance with roller skating!
I wasn't one bit surprised when the family in front of us with 3 young boys under the age of 13 left the theater about 15 minutes after the film started.
I mean, I remember seeing him for the first time in Back to the Future when I was little, and now this?
Besides that, when I look out of my window, I see a HUGE wall which was more interesting.
The snake is eating its own tail when it comes to these spoofs.
I wasn't expecting much when I paid for my ticket to see this film, however this was the first time I actually considered leaving the theatre in the middle of a film because it was so bad.
Epic Movie temporarily halts the predictable, unfunny jokes close to the end of the film, when Kal Penn (who made two Harold and Kumar references, also falling quite flat, even amongst the largely tweenage audience) spells out the film's moral--a sappy and poorly placed monologue on the importance of family.
Seeing the trailer is a bit of a spoiler as well, as you can tell when certain parts are coming up, effectively ruining the humor.
Don't even watch it on TV when nothing else is on.
It appears that the budget was spent on midgets and a dance choreographer (apparently it is funny when medieval knights, pirates, dwarfs and oompa loompas dance).
No, actually there was no funny content in the previews at all, it just seemed that way when taken out of the context of the movie.
Remember the days when directors actually directed films?
But when a man comes to replace their beloved skating rink with a mini mall, she will stop at nothing to stop him.
I thought, this is what happens when Goliath puts on a suit and pretends to be a secret agent.
Well, I didn't choose wisely when I rented this movie.
I'm all for the suspension of disbelief (especially when watching a movie on the hallmark channel) but the idea that a guy could be riding his horse around in a war and *not* know it was pregnant strains incredulity to it's limits.
The only interesting footage is when musicians explain the emotional impact of Mozart's music.
Mary Lou hides in the trunk of Sonny's car, much to the consternation of Sonny when he finds her.
What follows is a film during which the two boys constantly act just an unrealistically as the Hardy Boys who, when faced with things like the sounds of ghosts in creepy mansions, are famous for uttering such things as "I don't feel obliged to remain in this house one moment longer!"
In this case, the game goes on for far too long, the plot becomes far too ridiculous, and when the players get tired, the DM wraps the ending up with far too much haste and too little closure.
I was just nearly five when this movie came out so I didn't get to see it until a few years later when Channel 4 showed it as a retro late night film.
I remember finally getting a pair of all white-leather roller boots, hard to come by over here, but they were the best present ever - I still have them and they still fit and I hope to be wearing them when I teach my niece how to skate too!
Mine came today, I've watched it, and I will probably watch it in the future when I'm snuggled up on the sofa, full of cold or maybe a hangover and just watch it - it is my feel good movie and one that few will ever enjoy as much as me!
Follow a group of slackers interacting with each other and then cut away to new group when new passerbys come on-screen.
when i saw the trailer to this film i had high hopes and then when i found out that Mark Jones was behind it i figured it would be good i loved the first leprechaun but even though the trailer was good sadly thats about the only good thing about the film, it trys to hard to be funny and you just start feeling sorry a quarter of the way through asking yourself why am i still watching this maybe it might get better I've seen it all the way and let me answer that question with a big no.
Having recently viewed Feast and Feast 2( two hilarious "A" for effort movies) I had the utmost faith when I saw the Dimension Extreme logo in the corner.
My friend's head was in the right place when he purchased Triloquist on a whim.
Years later, the autistic dumb Norbert (Rocky Marquette) and his seventeen year-old alcoholic sister and whore Angelina (Paydin LoPachin) are living on the streets; when the dummy slaughters a boy, Norbert is accused and arrested by the police and sent to an asylum with his dummy.
In summary, a waste of the talents of Sarandon and Baker, who have both done vastly better when given better material.
There were hilarious moments when the camera was trying to get the natural vantage point of an off road race, but because of the wind all you could see were tires and dust because tree branches covered the screen.
The worst were the uncomfortable moments when Joe Don whooped it up after knocking innocent, unassuming competitors into walls, off of cliffs, or out of focus (each ending in explosion and emphatic death).
I've never found her to be good looking, but I always figured she must have gotten in by being hot when she was younger.
Not only do plane crashes not leave mushroom clouds, but when the image is compared to those of military grade bombs, a striking resemblance can be seen.
Why make a move that links itself to such a pivotal piece of American history when you can't improve on the Hollywood version of United 93?
When the passengers rise against the terrorists it is very brave but they show the passengers pouring water on the terrorists when the are down.
The most hilarious thing about that BS was the fact that just about all of the relatives receiving phone calls were holding small babies when they took the calls!
when the Mark Bingham call was made.
But the clincher was when that light aircraft was reporting a visual sighting of flight 93.
Yes, I rated this a 7 out of a 10....I only gave it a 7 because I haven't seen it since I was 7 years old......don't know if it's the 10 I used to think it was hee hee I loved Roller Boogie hee hee...I must have watched that movie a million times when I was a kid.
I'm afraid that if I see it now I'll be supremely disappointed by my childhood innocence like I was with Saturday Night Fever...whew...I had no idea what was going on there until I saw it when I got older..again I had tunnel vision as a kid.
They watch a film (this one) that shows a hijacker wearing a bomb-belt, when he was earlier shown going through X-ray security at Newark airport.
It's up to Terry and Bobby to save the place but when word spreads that they have a taped conversation Thatcher attempts to stop them!
Add to that, so much potential arises within the script by Steve Slavkin for satirical jabs at the high school movie experience that you find yourself, when the movie mindlessly passes over these moments, banging your head against the wall at such wasted opportunities.
"Cutting Class," however, still receives a failing grade in my book when you think the movie couldn't get any more tedious, when it reverts to type and descends into typical slasher/haunted house movie territory in the third act.
Brian and Dwight were once the best of friends, but that turned sour when Brian was accused of murdering his abusive father and as a result was sent away to a mental institution for a few years.
A slasher flick is a slasher flick, but when the dialog is terrible and the actors aren't much better, it becomes just another ho hum event; one that I am sure that Brad Pitt would like to forget.
Someone is bumping off the teachers of a school and it's up to the lovely innocent Paula Carson(Jill Schoelen, always a sight for sore eyes, especially when bending over in a short skirt)to find out who it is.
It came out when the slasher era was about to end.
The scene I remember the most from the movie is when a girl (using no panties), goes under the gym's step staircases and gets stabbed.
Apparently, he'd been an artist but it all went to pieces when his love left him for another.
Not to mention the use of music- Typical twangy western music is used here, but the tempo is upbeat when it should be suspenseful- any attempt at atmosphere is usually ruined.
Complications, however, occur when a thuggish land developer blackmails Jammer to sell his rink, so he can raze the building and build a shopping mall.
I can suspend belief when it comes to TV shows, hence my knowing it was on Sci-Fi, but i can not even comprehend how this show lasted past episode 4.
Rebuilding the world, or what is left of it, is a topic that can engage us for a long time, but the people in this clueless town act like "oh, a bunch of nuclear bombs wiped out most of our country, when is Oprah on!."
He is also a fine mechanic (although not as fine as the sexy school teacher whom he initially patronises when she offers her help), he can handle a gun, he can give moving speeches and he is an explosives expert ("Where did you learn to do that?"
On several occasions, they stupidly squander resources - like when they have a giant town BBQ with the meat so it doesn't spoil instead of smoking or salt-curing it; or like lighting up the street lights with the limited electric power they have.
The only thing that I can think when reading the negative comments left for this movie is that the people who wrote them have *clearly* never temped.
Even when they run out of food they don't leave town - they simply find a wrecked food train just outside their city....
We also learn that the people of Jericho turn to the mayor and police when their utilities stop working.
Most of the gags had been done before and better in other films and on TV by the time this was made so it was like watching reruns of reruns.3 Chairs for Lefty, which stars Bill Murray is rife with the sort of prison jokes that have been around since the 1930's,including giving Lefty a roast to cook when he finally goes to the chair.
This is especially true when Werner meets a beautiful young model (Kyra Sedgwick) whose father is a comatose patient at the hospital.
The leftwing always tries to hide its bloody face behind anti-war/anti-American probanganda - but when they are at power, they become the most hateful and cold killers, though the hide behind that they are doing it to people who have the wrong opinion.
I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that it was coming out!
I don't think anyone expects Citizen Kane when you see a movie called Roller Boogie but I think it is campy and fun, especially the large skating scenes on the boardwalk and in the rink.
and when you do, he has on very cheap makeup that looks like a facial mask in a beauty saloon.
Seems the devil worshippers in Rural Backwoods USA have a tough time of it when they are beset by Tom Skerritt and Eddie Albert, who vow to destroy them after Satan-izing innocent people they hold dear - who happen to include William Shatner and Ida Lupino....
Then comes the rain, when....
Even when a "surprise" ending isn't all that much of a surprise, you know you're watching something bad.
Eddie Albert must have read my mind when he asks Tom Skerritt in one scene where they come into a ghost town, "The Devil's Rain?
But this is what happens when you make a smashing success like "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist."
Of all the actors, the one who deserves the biggest round of Bronx cheers is Borgnine, whose performance is utterly awful--particularly when he, believe it or not, transforms into a ram-man late in the film.
If you have a chance, try picking up a book or do a web search of Bosch's works--they are amazingly bizarre and unusual when seen today.
Believe it or not, when he was painting in the 15th and 16th centuries, he was very popular and others often copied his odd symbolism.
The Devil's Rain features a handful of performances from good, established performers...and it kind of makes you wonder what they were thinking when they signed up.
But at the same time he was very evil when push came to shove.
You know a movie is in trouble when it seems they are rushing things so no startling revelations here, only lets rush to the cool ending.
And when they brought him to the morgue I was like "Oh my God, they're gonna bury him alive!"
I was so relieved when he started crying and the people noticed!
My hart still starts thumping when I think about the episode.
I'm really picky when it comes to musical movies, and this one really sucked.
Tom Berenger must have been desperate for work when he signed on for this embarrassment of a film.
It has the feel and tone of the kind of made for television movie you might watch out of sheer boredom and exhaustion on a Sunday afternoon when you're too tired either to locate the remote or to fire a bullet at the television screen.
The acting is wooden and unnatural, and the music, which is supposed to be awesome, sounds curiously like a bad rip-off of Springsteen, even though the flashbacks in the film are set, for the most part, in 1963, when NOTHING sounded like Springsteen.
The movie works best when it's almost like a documentary, charting the failures and humiliations of the surviving "Cruisers" in later life.
I was a male prostitute when i was young and this movie is so way off that i can't believe someone even thought of making it.
Namely, Eric (played nicely by Jordan Brower), the kid who helps Johnny out the most when it seem many others won't.
Johnny and Eric get into serious trouble when Steven steals another kid's stash of drugs and money, and he isn't the kind of kid you just say sorry to and then treat to ice cream.
The makers obviously this is cool when in actual fact, it is incredibly daft.
The strange thing is, the bullets don't even scratch the windshield, even when the firer is shooting at close range.
A personal observation: when I first looked this up after watching it, I could not believe my eyes when I found out it was made in 2001.
Callew is away at the beach relaxing when he gets a call from an employee that was canned.
There are instances when different people approach the crash thinking Callew is dead.
Sure, the story's opening hints of romance when the world was young, but then can't decide if it was ten or a hundred thousand years ago.
Come to think of it, if the male tribe had a streak of cannibalism, old Guadi might have been on the menu when he became a crispy critter - yikes!
This was probably a lot of fun for a date movie in the local Bijou when it was released in 1950.
when I wished she could have had a more substantial part.In "D.O.A".
I was struck by Laurette's exotic looks and when I looked up her biography on IMDb.com, it did not surprise me that she was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.I have a serious weakness for beautiful 1940s film actresses with raven black hair.I have every film Jennifer Jones ever made as well as examples of Ava Gardner, Margaret Lockwood, Patricia Medina and Vivien Leigh; not that I am putting Laurette Luez on a par with those film goddesses but as said by a reviewer above she meets my need for agreeable "eye candy".
Films like this trigger prehistoric urges in all of us.I noticed when I started to pen my review that IMDb.com only rated it 2.7/10.That seemed a little harsh for the entertainment factor alone, so I scored it 4/10.
If the audience knows that the bomb is under the table but not when it will go off, that's suspense.
White Noise 2 starts when a guy has a near death experience and learns that he can see which people are to die soon by simply looking at them and checking them out.
It's when the movie delves into some kind of Satanic "twist" that completely took me out of the movie.
Basically Abe Dale (Nathan Fillion) has his wife Rebecca (Kendall Cross) and son while eating lunch in a restaurant, when they were shot by a man who then shot himself.
Abe passes many people who he can see lit up, and he finds out that this means they are due to die, and when he saves three of them, their light vanishes, including nurse Sherry Clarke (Katee Sackhoff).
While looking back at some footage of his wife and son, Abe sees the man who who murdered them, Henry Caine (Craig Fairbrass), and when he sees him (very badly scarred) he finds out that he was seeing light on people also.
To its credit, White Noise 2 starts in a promising fashion - displaying some genuinely unsettling statistics on screen - ones which when taken out of the context of the movie are enough to make anyone stop and take note.
This Tammy person talks about how she got to know Pandora's Box when she went there with Lance, then seconds later announces there's a rule that you should come alone the first time.
Even when the authorities and emergency workers arrive at the scene, he is still mistaken for a dead man.
That would have been inspired and very funny, but the only LAME attempt made at borderline cultural humor is when the Sellers character tells the party's host daughter that painting an elephant with slogans like "Go Naked" is "embarrassing."
when i watched this crap, it reminded me of the the title of the movie FIRE, Which is where this garbage belongs, in a fire.
This is an episode that I saw when I was a small child.
It seems that Ranger Jake with all his knowledge of the great outdoors didn't realize that a mine shaft that's leaking with dangerous and explosive methane gas is the last place to go when all the woods around it is on fire!
***SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON*** All this started some time ago when Ranger Jake in an effort to save the not that on the ball miner Tiny, Chris Harz aka "The Sherd", let him slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the mine shaft, or did he!
A paramedic comes to help him, but gets stranded with them when the helicopter breaks.
But then their injuries suddenly return when the plot needs them to.
The premises of four motor bikers out motto-crossing in a national park when one of them has an accident that needs a park ranger to come rescue them only for them to get caught in a forrest fire is weak and predictable that you know every beat before it happens.
In Germany ,in the 30's and 40', light Viennese comedies were popular on the cinema,like"The porch conscert",,1935,directed by Douglass Sirk.Well, Hitler was failing when this movie was being produce.
There are plenty of movies one can enjoy by checking ones brain in at the theatre door; but when a movie cloaks itself in a supposedly complex plot and encourages the audience member to engage his or her brain, and then doesn't even stand up to scrutiny, I find the whole process deeply depressing - more so when the film takes itself as seriously as this one evidently does.
The plot is set in motion when the good guys "knock list" is stolen.
...The "laughter" of a sophisticated Binoche when a banality is uttered.
However when Elliot's secret American son and a dangerous hit-man, John Turturro, show up the meeting is canceled.
The first involves the abandoned Paris meeting when William Pound arrives at the hotel to surprise IrÃ¨ne and Elliot.
But when she is shown at work as a secret agent, gun in hand, she is compelling.
Well when I turned on my Dirrect TV sat box and saw that show I read the description and it looked good.
This movie was a joke from the opening credits to the very end all I can say is that they got it right when they picked the lead actress.
It struck me as quite convenient that the scientific arsenal on the island included welding equipment just when it was needed.
Nothing is shown when the shrews attack someone and the first ones to die are (of course) the black guy then the Latino.
I remember after viewing this movie when I was a kid I always wondered where I would run if the Shrews came running after me.
Jerry resents this so he tries to kill Rosco when they go check out the yacht.
A carpet dog pokes his nose through some wooden shutters, so Rosco cleverly attacks him with the blowtorch, coz that won't cause problems when the house burns down.
Interestingly enough, these shrews look pretty much like dogs with cheesy costumes when they are shown walking or running, and in closeups they resemble nothing from this planet--they are just too weird to explain.
Although all this was really cheesy, what I thought was funniest was when people were holding normal shrews and playing with them, as in real life, shrews are insane and would have probably torn them to pieces.
The climax of this movie is the middle, which isn't a good thing at all, and that's when he is proclaimed dead by the doctors, and is sent to be buried in the graveyard, the same thing we've seen in the beginning of the story, but it hasn't touched a character we care about yet.
I remember when I this show came out I was about 8 years old when I saw that bubble blowing stand episode.
I mean I know this is going to sound stupid but liked it when it was underrated and not many people knew it existed!
I liked every game show that were Nick when I was little, and I still watch them today.
I can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music .The soundtrack will feature bands like Nirvana , N.W.A , Public Enemy , Soundgarden etc .The movie like this will be just as cheesy as The 60's and I gurantee you NBC will do it .See the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time .Next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project
I remember thinking Spongebob was the most stupid thing in the world when it first came out, but after my friend convinced me to watch one episode I found out that it actually was a decent show.
Other scenes , they call for a stuntman to take over when another actor cant perform.
I saw this when I was 15, in the theater...
This is a product of the 70s when movies like this and Fairy Tales, Flesh Gorden and such were taking almost adult movies(no plot lots of skin) to the mainstream theaters.
I did like the part, though, when that dyke's body splits in half just because she smashes into a tree branch, that part was both stupid and hilarious at the same time!
I about fell over on my rear end laughing when that part came up!
Another idiotic part of the movie (possible spoiler) is when the cop gets killed, the dude and the blonde get the keys to his police vehicle off his key chain attached to his belt loop...and...they...RUN.
Indian men are ready to wash dishes and be a waiter, drive cabs, sweep the Airport premises to keep it clean Âall this just to be in a foreign land as they get paid in dollars - which when converted to Indian currency makes him a rich and sought after groom in India.
Indian parents , of daughters especially, forget everything else when they see that a man is having a bank balance good enough to support their daughter for the rest of her life !
I think it's her 4th movie, so it's interesting for me to see her when she was "younger"--although that's only a few years ago!
Fourth, sometimes they were just nonsense--A great example is when they go to the "Grapp Family Lodge" towards the end of the movie.
A movie can have a message, but when you have 35 different messages...well, it doesn't work.
I've seen other Olsen Twins movies, and most of them were ok, (It Takes Two) And one, 'Our Lips Are Sealed', was probably the best, so I had high hopes when I saw this on TV.
It is not strange that US is leading so much wars, that it has so much drug addicts, teenage mothers and so on: when in movies like this you may see that it is normal to bribe people with magazines, video-games and jerseys to win a competition; black people with dreadlocks have never seen computer in their lives; nobles are evil; relationship between 15 year old girl and 22 yearn old boy( or should I say man) is normal and socially acceptable---it is just a step from pedophilia, people.
However, when one of her team mates cannot attend, Chloe's twin sister Riley step in (mostly so she can hook up with some guy on the team).
Also, there are times when you can see how low budget this movie is.
The relationship was almost redeemed when the word 'love' was finally uttered near the end of the film, but it was too little, too late for this dated and cowardly film.
The makers rush through it so much that there's little or no time to give the characters any character, with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time - the children's father is especially clichÃ©d - and then when they're back on BLAMMO!
Let's just put it this way - my wife, who has only been in the U.S. for half a year and speaks only a small amount of English - whispered this to me when the girl first appears in JG's pad, and I swear to God I am not making this up: "She go to house to kill girl.
Just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way.
I had read the book once before when it was first released (I had also read Angels & Demons which I enjoyed only slightly more than TDC), and a week before it's release decided to read it again to brush up on the story.
This also happens when the beginning hints at Sophie's falling out with her grandfather and later Langdon suddenly says: what happened?
Apparently this film and book offended some peoples imaginary friend.I can see why, such a waste of money when people are going hungry.
The story talks the investigation by Symbologist Langdom when happen the killing of Museum Louvre's curator named Jacques Sauniere(Jean Pierre Melville).The corpse is around with codes,cipher and symbols.Nearly from him they have found a baffling pentagram and a Fibonacci numbers.Solving the enigmatic questions,Robert along with the cryptologist Sophie are stunned to discover clues leading a trail of enigmas hidden,thus with the Leonardo's paintings : Gioconda and Madonna on the rocks find a riddling key with a flower the Lis .It leads them to a Bank where its director named Andre Vernet(Jurgen Prochnow) deliver the security safe containing a keystone.But a French police inspector named Fache(Jean Reno)chases Langdom and Sophie.Meanwhile a murderer psychopath and masochist monk wearing a cilice for inflicting pain so he can suffer as Christ suffered, is pursuing them.Besides an Opus Dei bishop named Aringarosa(Alfred Molina) is scheming odds plans.
The movie is a genuine ripping yarn with intrigue,mystery,tension,outstanding surprises but with a plethora of blasphemies.The film is an excuse for a merciless criticism at Catholic religion,the only one apparently can to be criticized.It's plenty of theories for nuts,this is an old wives'tale.There's virtually no empirical proof and venturing into the even more bizarre theory about relationship between JesusChrist and Mary Magdalena.Absurd theories about Â¨the last supper'the great fresco of Leonardo.The maximum ridiculous about female symbol when the chalice resembles the shape of a woman's womb.Besides inventing a new Gospel according to Philip what was rejected at the council of Nicea by emperor Constantino.A stupid lies concerning on women like a huge threat to the Catholic Church,accusing Inquisition publishes what may be the most blood-soaked book in human history: The Malleus Malleficarum,the witches' hammer,it is instructed the clergy on how to locate,torture and kill all freethinking women,during witch-hunt ,the movie tells, fifty thousand are captured ,burned alive at the stake,it's a complete lie ,someone can to be but no such deal.Besides the Templars slaughter was executed by ambitious King Philip IV of France ,isn't committed by Catholic church for hide the Holy Grial guarded along centuries by Grand Maestre and his guardians called the Senechals and forming a millenarian sect constituted in secret society called the Priory of Sion.
Also, the Louvre does not have steel gates that come down when a painting is removed from the wall.
Too many ludicrous things happen that made me ask questions while it is happening, not after it's all done when you would get the Hitchcock "refrigerator moment".
I watched this when it was first broadcast, living at the time in Washington DC, where the press was harrumphing about what a dangerous, subversive, anti-social act it would be to watch this paranoid fantasy.
The brainless lefty, Kris Kristofferson, when asked why he took such an uncharacteristic role (leader of a revolt against Soviet overlords of a conquered America) answered that he did it because he thought another actor might have been able to do serious damage in such a role.
I guess when they open a Mc Donalds in Moscow the signs where there!
I remember when this dreadful mini-series first played.
I watched this miniseries when it was broadcast, and taped it thinking it would be something worth keeping.
It was 100 times more interesting when we were fast forwarding it.
Chenoa Maxwell whom must be best friends with Christopher Scott Cherot to be in another one of his low-budget films looks like she works out with Hulk Hogan or something...when she was in Hav Plenty she was cute as hell...what Happened!?
This is not The Great Gatsby that F. Scott Fitzgerald had in mind when he wrote the classic novel.
Despite my high hopes, and, as one user commented, it's not a good sign when it takes 3 years to get a movie out there.
Technically, I am a Boomer, though at the time when all the "idealistic youths" of the '60s were reading Marx, burning their draft cards, and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives; I was still in grade school.
But the penny drops the more the film goes on when you realise it's not meant to be a serious film and couldn't have been made by a serious film maker   The plot revolves around a woman called Bella who moves to Brighton and is the victim of a stalker who phones her when she's alone , though the stalker is both written and played in such an over the top manner that he's somewhat difficult to take seriously .
Bella then takes advice from an Iranian clairvoyent ( As I'm sure anyone in her situation would do ) then it's revenge against the penis people all the way   As you can imagine I had this sussed out as a role reversal of DEATH WISH but about two thirds of the way through the entire tone of the movie changes when we're introduced to " The lady in red and spanky fat boy " .
Michael Winner is naughty and when he is that at the expense of power, everything is OK.
However, she's put off when the nutter (Rufus Sewell, the only cast member to maintain dignity), tells her he's got a bottle of acid.
I didn't pay very much for this movie when I bought it but I felt bad when I sold it knowing that it was not worth what I got for it.
I was so angry when I watched this movie that I threw it in the trash after I broke it in a million pieces and cut the tape to shreds.
April 15, 2004 was when saw this movie.
I slept on it and when I woke up I realised that there was so much more wrong with this film.
It bothers me when someone comments that an issue was not covered enough or it was not entertaining enough.
And when the Titanic came up in the book it came up the way they last saw TITANIC in 1012 stern first.
He eventually relented more than 20 years later, when "Sahara" arrived.
It's in an English cemetery, but of course opening graves isn't much of a story line when compared to raising sunken liners, is it?
What is much clearer is what producer Lew (later Lord) Grade meant when he said "Raise The Titanic?
It was more like a fairy tale when the byzantium turned into gravel!
Firstly, they meet when Susan comes up to him randomly and abruptly on some Boston street and asks him to walk her to the corner because someone's following her.
Cut to a light turning on when they are naked in bed.
Viewers may recoil at a couple of scenes but the movie is very tame when compared to movies such as the Killer or Hard Boiled.
I saw it about a week ago and when I decided to watch it, I didn't get my hopes up.
Not the film, but the review by RAROME when he calls the film, "One of the funniest Latino Exploitation films ever."
Paris Hilton (while stupid) is no dummy when it comes to money.
That will help them a lot when they get out in the real world, and think that having a pink cell phone and Vuitton handbag will equip them for reality.
" No Corporal " I replied " It`s the isle of Bute and they`re called Brandanes " But come to think of it when I walk down the streets of Rothesay on the Isle of Bute and see the inbred lumpen underclass drinking on top of empty heads I do think Corporal Williams may have been right .
The most excruciating example is the scene at the very end when the two FBI agents have this really presumptuous and pretentious theory session on murder and consumerism.
She says that when she first read the script (by John Byrum), she was taken aback by the untruthfulness's of it.
It has some rare Hitchcock touches, as with the superimposed "candidates" in the chair (I loved it when Minta sat down to take their place).
I find that when a movie is poorly written no manner of great acting can save it, not that there was any great acting in "Contagion."
Her phone's ringing constantly in the beginningÂ and for two days not a single call until the very end when she's walking away from the hospital.
The only good acting that happened was when Nurse Washington knew she was going to die and just had to make her loss felt.
The only good acting that happened was when Nurse Washington knew she was going to die and just had to make her loss felt.
I loved how when one of the doctors was studying the virus she started to rub her eyes and mouth with the same gloves that she was studying the virus with.
It's not that the movie wasn't entertaining when it was supposed to be serious, it was just trying to be too serious of a movie with a very low budget, it seemed.
There were some moments when it just got too long because it was supposed to be "intense" but instead it was just aggravating.
The only actor who was any good was the 10 year old boy, who actually had feeling when he cried.
Everyone has time to flirt when there is a hot agent that is air borne around a hospital.
However, when every other change of pace involves something that defies all odds, it gets old.
The ending was annoying, first with her cutting only one of the straps on the tunnel and it expanding and then when she made the last second phone call.
In fact it`s impossible to take seriously the whole idea that an idiot like this would be able to engineer such a virus , especially when the script points out that not even the defence department has the resources to create such a virus .
But it gets worse ( No small feat ) when it`s revealed that ugly American woman has got an antidote to the virus ( Like I said it`s no small feat the way this film degenerates ) so Irishman phones the president to tell him if he gets $100 million the president gets the antidote .
But the president turns down the offer because " The United States doesn`t negoiate with terrorists " Now let`s think about this , the president has been told his organs will slowly dissolve due to the virus and when offered something to stop this happening he turns it down on principle !
First of all the acting in the movie was absolutely terribly except for one minute part in the movie where Washington dies, she was the only person who showed emotion when she actually died.
I wish I would of been paying attention to the scene, when it was playing.
And the third tells about how she once got her husband to admit his philandering when they were stuck in an elevator.
Then when they were having the party why the police wasn't there?
Then all his stuff was gone in just a few hours when truly it takes more than a few hours to packed all of those things.
In fact, films like 'American Pie', which may be thought of as more modern equivalent of this 1980s movie, are (for good or bad) massively more vulgar and direct when it comes to presenting sex.
Even at a mere 46 minutes, the film is mostly a drag Â since the comedy is generally forced, thus unfunny, and the quality of the animation extremely poor when compared to the dazzling imagination displayed by the form in its heyday.
when i rented it, i thought it was some kind of joke.
One of the letters is "when you meet the perfect guy you should do anything to make him happy."
Firstly I would like to point out that the "spoiler alert" will spoil nothing as it was already spoiled when it was made.
There was little dialog through the film and when there was you almost wish there wasn't.
You can't really blame the actors when the actual script is that bad.
The best example to the sadness of this attempt at film, is when the headless body is shown.
The relationship is pretty much over when his severed head is sitting on the table.
The kids' parents flip out when they find out that the coach has been holding extra practices for his good players in order to make sure they stay sharp.
Why use CGI when you don't even have to?
This was when I started putting the DVD player on "x4".
Especially when there is little to no money.
If even the slightest bit of care was given to this thing when it was in idea phase instead of the "hey, mommy, look at me!
I hate it most when the wives tell us at the beginning who they are.
This movie (when viewed in context of his forgettable 'Razorback') prove he his a terminal lack of attention span for anything which requires more than 5 minutes of coherent screen time and filling more substantive than eye candy.
This is one of the worst movies I have ever-seen, even with its cast, which is impressing when you hear the all names, but they mean nothing, I doubt even if this had, the perfect cast(A Bond age Sean Connery) and Uma Thurman, even with them the plot would collapse, the cast would help, but not enough.
It's funnier when humans are doing/saying idiotic things.
I saw 'Hot Saturday' at the Film Forum in NYC, and several people in the audience made nudge-wink noises when Scott's character shyly admitted that he's not very comfortable with women.
Even more so, when one compares them to the Porter originals left in.
An example of the lunacy is when, in a lyric, "4-letter word" becomes "3 letter-word."
The Artemisa man Sandoval is a person that, within the time living in a Cuban system, understood that it was not good for his future and life of his family, but to put him as a 'contra' when he was a young man is doubtful.
The only part, which looked to me real was the the talk between Arturo and the American officer at the USA Embassy in London when Arturo wanted to leave Cuba because the officer raised the right questions.
But when they make a movie about real life things, like the space shuttle for instance, I expect at last half an attempt to make it believable.
And then when her husband climbs into a mini-sub and drops into the shuttle at the bottom of the ocean - all plausibility is completely gone!
It was such a flagrant steal that I expected pretty little water aliens to appear when the romantic leads get stuck in a collapsing DSRV.
However, their plan is road blocked when, Meridith, the creepy, stalker, spoiled queen of the school splits them up into different cliques.
Honestly, it's a toy I played with when I was little.
Whatever happened to the days when starlets got parts based strictly on their beauty with their acting skills irrelevant?
Bratz was on the bottom 100 when it was on the cinemas but still has a very low rating, which is fair enough.
It was boring with many daft scenes like when one of the four girls was changing her clothes while the other three were covering her.
One thing, is that I never understood when the phrase "Brat" ever became a good thing and how a high school teenager hitting on a 11 year old was ever a good thing.
My girls will not grace the movie in the theaters (I am sorry I did), and it will NOT come to our home when in DVD.
Ummm that deaf kid wasn't even deaf...when he first appeared I thought hey an interesting subplot...but I was wrong.
The acting was not award winning but the girls otherwise did alright...except for when they had to show any ~real~ emotion other than thoughtless glee; then, they failed.
Real High School issues revolve around violence, sexual identity issues, peer pressure, not having a CLUE what you're going to do when you get out, etc., etc.
SUMMARY: Plot - Ronald McDonald, Acting - None, Entertainment - You'll be REAL happy when its over.
i went to go see this movie with my friend when we were bored (it just so happened to be the movie's opening night).
If you feel any emotion, be it happiness, joy, elation or even sadness (in context to the film, as opposed to its existence) during the running time of this film, you are unfortunately a biased person...or are 2 years old, in which case you would not have the mental capacity to read this or form opinion throughout the film...except for when to soil yourself during its run time.
It also has enough montages to kill a few horses, Jon Voight with not only a prosthetic nose but a statue of his head with the same fake nose, a fluffy dog who gets beauty treatment along with her owner, a mariachi band that lives at the house of the Hispanic girl of the Bratz (and, for some reason, this doesn't seem too out of place, especially when they show up at talent shows), and...Jesus, did I mention the montages?
It also makes for some ample absurd moments when just seeing the four Bratz having a fight amongst themselves about sticking together or going off into their other interests (naturally, they have only one aptitude a piece, one soccer, one cheer-leading, one science, and one journalism/singing), and as well the diabolical attempts to thwart all of their fun by the nasty, less than one-note daughter of the principle, who goes for a 2nd super sweet sixteen party even after she's turned 16.
The first words that came out of my mouth when I found out my friend's sister wanted to see this for her birthday.
But don't worry, when she really needs it (for a dress), her friends have gift certificates.
i had high hopes for two came back.obviously the ending is predictable,given the title.basically,a group of friends agree to sail a yacht for someone from san diego to vancouver.along the way,they get caught in a massive storm and all but two of them perish.the main focus of the story centres not so much on the storm,but its aftermath.the crew is left adrift in the middle of the ocean and struggle to survive,as they hope to be rescued.of course as days pass,each of them deals with their plight differently and eventually,when they are rescued there are only two remaining alive.that is the gist of the story.i thought it would be a better movie than it was,but it was mostly a bore.most of the actors weren't convincing.then again,they didn't have a lot to work with dialogue wise,so they can't be faulted entirely.the scenes of the storm were pretty exciting,but fairly brief.pre teens will probably enjoy this movie, but if you are in your mid teens and older,don't expect to be too entertained.
In my later years I'm learning to appreciate Bing's movies more than when I was young.
What were the casting directors thinking when they cast these two in the leads?
And since when is a guy being a hunk criteria for granting a movie a positive review?
Watch this one when you can, but don't cancel anything important in order to do so.
The biggest surprise of the movie is when I found out that it's a comedy.
For example, when trying to convince a skeptical newcomer to join the team, Torrance says with a cheesy grin, "We work hard, we have fun, and we win national championships."
This movie would've been a hoot amongst some of the pseudo-intellectual Arts students when first released.
This just happened to be on HBO when I turned the channel and the description sounded interesting enough, and there were recognizable actors in it.
There were moments when character development threatened to appear, as some sort of depth was introduced to the 2D stars, only for it to vanish as if it had wandered in only by accident and didn't want to cause a fuss.
He works nights at the docks, and is only there when she is out).
There's a bit of humour injected when Iris informs a potential client that a specimen cannot be made out of a malevolent shadow.
Here and there, one may see bits of the original novel struggling to break through--as in Bette's rage when she is told that Wenceslas Steinbock, whom she adores, has secretly entered into a romance with her niece Hortense--but those glimpses are more tragic than anything else, for exposing the greatness that this movie fails miserably to approach.
No wives were arrested, no sons had to escape from money-lenders promising to "kill your wife and your child" when debts were not paid.
We don't think (as) much about our past when we are not on our own and with the same logic, relationships can be defined as different forms of escapism, and this goes pretty much unnoticed all the time.
this is what happens when a white director tries to make a film about black culture, do yourself a favor and stay away.
A jump back to the days, when you could make silly movies and really didn't try to do anything else or sell the project as something it isn't.
The characters are engaging enough to keep it strangely watchable (when they die, you may not be moved, but you aren't glad, either), but there are too many dumb inconsistencies in the action scenes (especially in the level of damage that the robots' weapons can induce).
The kids are enjoying themselves, having sex and whatnot, when suddenly one couple is murdered by the mall's high-tech security robots.
Dull in parts, even when the action starts.
), our dear homme de bois, was actually at times quite laughable (the audience did laugh when they certainly weren't supposed to).
The only thing I found kind of funny was when they cue to real photos in the show.
I am glad I read up on the film here, though, because when I watched it I thought Oosh's brother was "Doosh."
It fails when it tries to shock a few times as well.
I watched it one sunday afternoon when I was bored out of my skull and there was nothing on television.
The capper is when a ghost lady comes out of a bowl of noodle soup.
Avoid this movie when you can.
- When asked why she adapted this novel, Bertrand said when she first read the book, she couldn't stop, and had all these images in her head, which was unusual since the atmosphere in the book is not European.
But when Barbe's character tells Iris that she can't take the shoes off, she gives him a quick look that says "ok, so you want to play this game" and decides to do it, preferring to live something rather than nothing.
Possible SPOILERS Here: Unfortunately the DVD box presents this movie as more than it is, almost supernatural, when it's really a psychological drama.
It does drag on with seemingly no point and just when you think something big will happen... it doesn't.
The ending was terrible but I was so glad when it was over.
Remember when we made "Leaving Las Vegas", and we promised each other that we'd each try and make the worst film ever just for kicks?
Whatever the degree of truthfulness in Haley's work, Roots had completed its transformation from history into hackneyed fiction when it came to television screens.
I cringed when I saw Simpson running across the African grasslands, not because of his subsequent notoriety, but because of the very unsubtle association between African ancestry and modern day athletic prowess.
That scene is pure trash, especially when George tells Reed that she would like to be a "darkie" so that he would come to her cabin and take her.
I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie, but I wanted to throw it out the window when I came across the first scene of the dead animals.
The story could have been handled much better and when I read the back of the box I expected a sort of Miami Vice like movie but as it turned out Miami Vice had much better acting and much better dialog.
Extremely unpleasant slasher film seems like a relic of another era - of the early 80's, to be exact, when all the "Friday The 13th" ripoffs were made.
Mathis is incredibly hard to watch as it is, then when she shares scenes with all of the above it just makes her look BEYOND FOOLISH.
I dislike prejudice in any form so it offends me to hear statements like, "Women are better at politics because they can admit when they've made a mistake."
when a return is attempted they are pushed even further beyond into what can only be described as another place or time beyond what we know as space.
I had the dubious honor of being a part of my high school's production of HELLO DOLLY a zillion years ago, so there was a time when I was intimately familiar with both the play and the film.
I'm bewildered as to why he wasn't able to bring that style to the table when he's behind the camera.
Those sequences depicting Nero's particular skills reach an unheralded level of silliness when he sky dives into the water onto a moving shark and slits its torso open without batting an eyelid!
He was still fixated on sharks a couple of years later when he made THE LAST SHARK (1981), a film which was partly shot in Malta and featured such second-tier American actors as James Franciscus and Vic Morrow.
As a marine I do get a little sick when I hear the big red neck guy use his chucks and scream out "thats the Marine corps boy!"
You get a real good kick when the "villains" chase down there targets in .
Michael is supposed te be sympathetic... but you just don't give a rat's bum if he dies or not... Why he HAS to wear long black clothing when he becomes a vampire will always be a riddle to me, like the JFK-assassination.
Everything from Underworld to the original Dracula featuring the one and only Bela...So when I found this in a bin for only $5.50, I thought SWEET!!!
You'll CRY when you watch it because you can actually feel your brain cells dying and shriveling up.
I already started getting worried when I saw the first images.. the movie was recorder with a simple dvcam (or even worse)..
I had no idea which planet some of these people were from when they opened their mouth.
The main character mourns his wife, but we never saw her alive or get a clue when whe died.
2) Why is the first time that we even know this guy has a home life is when we are in his wrecked home where he wants to get his sword?
i was a little uncertain when i was first introduced to this film...my friend had bought it and it really didn't seem interesting, i mean come on...another nazi v. jew film but i was surprised...  this story is origional following a little boy who is left alone and is being hunted by the nazi's.
In fact when another character in the movie asks him why he does live there, he doesn't answer.
For most of the movie they were depressed when they were together, dispite apprently liking one another.
But even more unrealistic, Ben doesn't seem terribly upset when he finds out.
And the scene in the courtroom when he 'confesses' because Diana would want him to be honest.
He is one of my favorite actors ever and I love it when he goes completely over the top like in Heat: "Cause she's got A GREAT ASS!
Chronicling the true-life story of Frank Serpico, a police officer who exposed corruption in the NYPD, the film comes from that exquisite golden age of cinema, lasting from the late '60s through the late '70s, when paranoia infected the country and our most trusted and honored institutions were becoming suspect.
When I watched Cold Fish, I had heard rumors that when it was first screened people walked out, not because it was bad, but because it was very disturbing.
But learn from my mistake and avoid when possible.
It's saying something when the two best performances come from "cameos" from Christopher Biggins and Rose Marie.
He's supposed to be a virile, dedicated newshound and sex machine and yet....with his strangulated accent and tendency to go cross eyed when he's concentrating, I end up trying to curb my laughter.
You really feel&fear for the kid when soldiers come to find the last of the Jews again and again and again...
At least when the ending credits roll.
Mr. Woodbine has to overcome his prejudices against vampires, when he finds himself falling in love with sexy Chinese vampire Bai Ling (as Lucy Westenra).
There are certain rules one must follow when in production of a vampire film.
Some argue that these rules were created by Universal Studios when they filmed the old 30's, 40's and 50's black and white horrors.
I was disappointed by The Breed, it's one of those films that make a fantastic trailer when they show ALL the cool bits in the space of two & a half minutes set against some techno music.
There are no cartoon Culkin tricks: he is afraid, he hides as every normal kid would do, and sometimes when he seems to do something brave, it is more because of hopeless resignation.
My two daughters (ages 5 and 2) were the luckiest girls in the world when a friend of mine gave them her original My Little Pony videotapes from the 80s.
I don't think we ever did get to see this "perfect city" of New Angeles that was always talked about, in fact, when the main characters finally reached New Angeles, its set in a factory or warehouse full of pipes and walkways; hardly the kind of "kingdom" the owner/creator of an entire city would dwell in.
The "super-high security" of New Angeles was also always talked about, but only a total of 15, maybe 20, security guards were counted, even when the alarm went off; not even close to Matthias' approximation of "at least a hundred men out there".
My husband, who has a liking for epic movies, dragged me to this movie (and I'm sick no less) and when it was over I couldn't believe I'd only been sitting there for only 2hours and 15 minutes.
I saw this film, the director's first attempt, when it debuted at the Philly Film Festival in 2002.
It is quite clear that he was much too emotionally close to resolving his own demons when he made this film.
It actually achieves beyond "Jakob the Liar" -- Alex's courage, his creative ways in taking care of himself when he's all alone, his tenacity and steadfast belief that his Dad would come back for himÂhold its own.
I don't mind fantasy but for gods sake don't mix it with truth, especially when you have an audience which sadly seem to often refer to this film when they are in a debate about world war 2 or the holocaust, as if it was some kind of historical reference with any credibility.
How can you watch a mystery when there's no mystery?
And it's not as much fun when you can't play along.
He decides to spend his time lying dynamite at the entrance to the camp for when the miners return.
And return they do, and when they see their leader dead on the ground and the girl still in the cage, they start shooting at her.
But when the plane crashes en route, he and the other survivors (a photographer and his model, a Vietnam veteran and his wife, and a scientist's daughter) must attempt to reach civilisation on foot, without losing too many body parts on the way.
One scene though when Kevin (I think) gets all red in the face, that`s fun!
I enjoyed the TV series and Harry Enfield's sketches, but when he came to the big screen, He didn't do as well as i thought he would.
Usually, when telling somebody about a movie I would finish by saying' but you should see it for yourself'.
The actors were near to the forties, when they made the film.
You have to be a little suspicious of the need for a documentary about someone's life when 80% of the interviews are with his family, his lover and a single member of his old theater company whose insistence on the "importance" of the work she did with him in the late 1980's seems geared just as much toward her own importance as it might be to explaining why we should spend all this time learning about Busch.
When you get middling actors at the top and an ensemble of supporters who could, when at their best, steal their scenes, it often means that the supporters are instead lowered to the level of the leads or worse.
Suzanne Pleshette is likewise flatted out and must have suffered under that hairspray and make-up (albeit that was typical of 64-66 when this was likely filmed).
What amazes me is that it just keeps getting stupider and stupider as it goes along, just when you thought such a thing couldn't be possible.
He has psychedelic experiences there, nearly gets killed when the merry-go-round goes out of control, but then leaves.
It is suddenly night when he gets there.
I have to wonder if Reagan's mind didn't hearken back to those days at Warner Brothers when in 1981 he was really shot.
Just don't think too much when you watch it--it will give you a headache!!
What was Chase thinking of when she went before the cameras?
Probably, when she was Bette Davis's compassionate sister-in-law in "Now, Voyager."
Wife, Dorothy Stickney, plays his queen and I'm wondering what the casting people had in mind when they put these people in.
The plot centers on a young couple as they're traveling through a remote area when their car suddenly breaks down and nearly crashes.
The only explanation for my having seen this was that it was part of a period of time in my younger days when myself and a friend went out and saw a movie every Sunday evening without fail, for two or three years straight.
Another funny part about this movie is that they give the main villain a handicap...you are not supposed to give the villain a handicap that would make the good guy look like a wimp when he wins.
But I have to differ from other reviewers regarding Pyun's direction... when you accept the given that the set production cost about $1.98, I think the direction is the only interesting part of the film.
And when it comes to the final scenes, that was so typical B-action.
Poorly made actionflick, stumbles from one pointless scene to another without any real plot to fall back on, hits a nadir when Van Damme is crucified on the cross.
Deborah Richter looks pretty good, especially when she's at the beach stark naked.
Also later when she briefly shows her boobs.
The stupidest sequence was when Van Damme gets crucified (hanging by ropes with nails in his wrists).
I explored that the realism within was quite lacklustre, with reference to when Van Damme's character escapes from the crucifiction cross - then began a mighty fighting scene, which was highly disappointing to the viewer.
Said travel includes flashbacks for The Hero to an earlier time when he suffered heavily at the hands of the same savage gang.
Also why on earth does the main bad guy wear chain mail when he's in a hot climate half of the time?
Boy I could only roll my eyes, especially when he opened his mouth and got into his posing stances.
Derek Accora is ridiculously cheesy, especially when he goes into trances that supposedly lead to him "channeling" an evil spirit.
Quite why this film gets to be called Cannibal Holocaust 2 when many better films get stuck with thinking of their own title is beyond me, but there's no way that The Green Inferno deserves to be associated with the Ruggero Deodato film.
On the way, they meet a horny river fisherman and child smugglers until they finally face off against the treasure hunters when they find the professor and his tribe.
I must admit the most amusing part was when I correctly guessed the little doggy had something to do with he whole thing, I couldn't believe I was right, I was laughing, that was the first time I have ever laughed at a movie!
Only when bodies start appearing all over the place do brains start activating: "Hey...!
Then, when I finally get home I discover myself lumbered with possibly the worst, and easily the sickest of all the many JAWS rip offs that have ever been made.
Not that I care too much, but when it's in the tagline that they are failed experiments, wouldn't you expect to see more of that?
I almost expected to hear the blonde competitor say, "You're okay LaRusso", when she presented the trophy, or have one of Pierre's kids get on the mike at the end and say, "If I can change...and you can change.........everybody can change."
Honestly, I just couldn't believe it: when this movie was written, someone must have been following the how-to-make-a-corny-movie recipe, because absolutely all of the ingredients are to be found in this film.
Then when they bust out you know you are watching something choreographed.
Also there's a Suspicion of Disbelief ALERT on this film- it will behoove you to use it when watching.
He added depth to his character and made him very believable when he could have taken the stereotypical-Black-angry-"thug-like"-teenaged character he was given and made us not care about his life.
My God, the last time I checked in the mirror I was Black, and yet when I go to the movies I start to question it b/c my parents aren't drug dealers and I've never seen a gun before.
Be cautious when deciding whether or not to spend time on this film.
I'll admit that when I first started watching this show, at a friend's request of course, I thought it was vaguely interesting.
This may be scientifically proved to catch things that we have scientific proof of, but when you're trying to catch PARANORMAL things with EVERY DAY technology, you've got to know that you're going to get little to nothing.
They use their "scientific method" to try to rule out regular happenings before they can draw a conclusion, but even when they do rule out everything else, they STILL aren't willing to admit it's paranormal.
For example, if they had a camera get knocked over or something, they would test for ground movement, wind, drafts in the house, physical intervention, etc etc, but even when they rule that nothing normal could've possibly effected it, they only rule that it could POSSIBLY be paranormal, and that's being generous.
A show that in my opinion should have been canceled a couple of years ago when it was becoming clear that one of the investigators, who we all know now was Grant was faking evidence for the sake of the viewers.
It's still on though even though during a recent live Halloween investigation it became clear that head investigator Grant was guilty of trying to pass off a fake voice and on the same show tried making it seem like his jacket was pulled on by a ghost, when it was clear he was doing it himself by something rigged in his pocket.
So when we see him walking off into the distance or climbing down a bluff, he has to walk or climb all the way back to his camera to retrieve it.
I don't hold any illusions to be some master film critic but I know bad acting and a bad film when I see one.
Lingering (as in "when will something happen") shots with no point permeated this movie.
If you watched this film on You Tube, there would be long stretches when you think your computer has locked up because nothing is happening until you realized that the crawl bar is actually moving.
Story-wise, it would have been better off set anywhere between the Fifties, because technically it's akin to the much better FAR FROM HEAVEN in melodrama, or even when this type of movies came into vogue during the period going from the late Seventies into the early Nineties.
The same can be said when Zoe makes Gonzalo prove to her he hasn't had sex with other women, or when in a repeat scene, she makes Ignacio promise her he hasn't had sex with men.
a haus frau who has little to do but talk with her gay confidant, another brother that paints sometime (we never know when) the gay confidant who does nothing but pine for one of the brothers and a mother, who has lunch, because she seems to be perpetually out to lunch.
That's about all we know about these people, except when they run into each other.
Three story in one movie, but you never really knew when one ended and another began.
It starts out okay, with Combs as Lovecraft seeking the Necronomicon inside a monastery, but when he finds it and starts reading it, the unfortunate viewer must endure 3 tales that are dreary instead of frightening, dull instead of engaging or morose.
I appreciate when a film crew manages to capture the spirit of the book being covered.
It's really difficult to be constructive when criticizing this feature, since it doesn't really give a serious impression.
One more thing about her is that when the killer wants her to come down he goes directly without telling to her husband.
they lost their estate and all their money, and ended up living back in the area they were living in for Rocky I. I also could not believe how Rocky's son from Rocky IV looked about 8 years old when Rocky left to fight Drago, and then when he gets back, his son in Rocky V, (who is Sylvester Stallone's real-life son) looked about 13 & dorky!
Further issues show up when it is revealed that Rocky has suffered head trauma and further boxing can seriously injure him (watching this movie could also give you head trauma).
Spoiler Alert I have to say that when I first saw the movies Rocky 1-3, I was in bliss.
it was great tho because when he gets back from Russia later that ,probably year, his son is 5 years older.
And when the end came it was a horrid finish!
The movie wouldn't be so bad if it actually showed her character development from a more personal-inner perspective ... but the journey is clouded through the integration of two men in her life and a weak plot that just seems to drag on and on and on ... at least that's how you feel when the so called "mystery" is solved.
Until he put on Silent Scream (VHS)when we got back.
(Why write something thought provoking and original, when you can appear daring and cutting edge, by just watching the news for your plots?)
They are right when they say this isn't science fiction, but what they don't understand, is that it isn't a good thing.
The first thing that pops to mind when you start watching a Battlestar Galactica episode is "Why?"
Why keep the same producers on salary when they clearly don't know how to make a TV show?
Why would SciFi keep hawking this dreadful show when it's clear it'll never have a big audience?
They are so ignorant, selfish and dumb that I started hating them all so much I laughed when they found Earth to be a post-apocalyptic wasteland.
I enjoy because I think that most of us who started watching televised science fiction (When there were really only three channels, when the creatures were usually enlarged garden denizens, large bug-like sculptures, or just some guy wearing something that looked like one of your auntie's failed quilting projects, and when any sci-fi tended to be broadcast long after our parents had been safely tucked into bed and Johnny Carson had signed off.)
I went through all of the stages of dying before the third season ended, lingering a little longer at "anger" and "denial" than I think I will when the time actually does come.
It shows when Adama and Apollo --his son-- embrace after Apollo has been out on a dangerous mission.
It shows when Starbuck, all choked up and having trouble speaking, sincerely tells the heavily advanced civilization of the Ship of Lights who just revived his dead best friend Apollo "Whatever you want from me, you can have".
The original concept, that the Cylons were fighting a genocidal war against humans was thrown out when it was revealed that several key humans were actually cylon sleeper agents.
It was similar to when the movie Aliens 3 starts starts off with meaningless deaths of key characters from Aliens2 or when Brad Ratner had Xmen start killing each other off in Xmen3.
The father also has the nerve to get angry when poor, misunderstood Bryan decides to kill a pet rabbit.
Scott Grimes, who plays the grandson, is a lousy actor for a kid, he can only portray a chipper, bright-eyed sparrow on the screen even when the scene calls for a deeper, emotional moment.
He's still got that wry smile on when he faces down old friend Paden at the end.
Went to this movie with my dad when we were in Minnesota.
Also, as another reviewer has reminded us, Miss Marple was the ultimate spinster and only had one small "fling" when young, which was maternally cut short.
It is quite revolting, and when coupled with the dire script, which is so saccharine one would not be berated for thinking it was laced with pixie dust and sugar, it gives a hideous effect of jolly-hockey-sticks village life, so stereotypical and contrived.
One really tires of the same old things when it comes to vintage movies.
Narration separates the audience from the characters, especially when the person narrating is not integral to the plot.
Some scenes were just plain over the top, to the point where I was laughing when I should've been focused on caring for these women.
It was meshed together in 15 days, when clearly three more weeks probably would've solved a lot of character problems and plot holes left over.
However, when you consider the fact that prisoners are wrongdoers who are in jail to pay their debt to society, it's rather hard to sympathize with their "plight" in this film.
Let me just say that when I shut my TV off at 11pm I was less than happy.
I am a huge Monkees fan, from the time I was a toddler (I was 1 when the show premiered).
I was excited when I saw that VH1 was going to air this movie, and kept an open mind while watching, knowing that no biopic ever gets it all right, and since I know more about the subject than the average viewer, I didn't want to judge too harshly.
The best part of the movie was in the early scenes when they were casting the show.
The movie seemed to try out one too many ideas into one movie when they should have just stayed with the main point at hand.
The only scene I thought was halfway effective or interesting was when they were all in the car and Dobbs was driving and Claudia was forced to talk about her sexual past and her relationship w/ Dobbs.
OK I understand where everyone is coming from when saying this is incredibly cheesy.
God also commanded the Isrealites to destroy nation and when they didn't kill everything in sight in the book of I Kings they were punished.
You don't see them for very long so it scares the pants off of you when you do.
Why are these embodiments then at fault, when these traits all exist in us?
How true these words ring, since I can't even count the number of times supervillains used mad science to make me doubt my faith in God when I was a kid.
they don't pay for their tickets OR their popcorn) critics but we part company in a major way when it comes to this movie.
Everything about this movie is extraordinary, and when I say that I am breaking that word into two parts as in EXTRA ORDINARY.
There are times when you watch a movie and the flow of the story comes to an abrupt halt because some character does something that just doesn't make sense.
David Cronenberg's A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE is an endless stream of such moments when characters' behaviors just don't ring true.
The story finds Viggo Mortensen playing Tom Stalls, a small-town cafÃ© owner whose peaceable bucolic life is shattered when he thwarts a holdup in his folksy little establishment.
Gangster Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) is such a trite caricature that when he shows up out of the past to confront Stalls, you expect him to step out of his black limo wearing a pinstriped suite and a white fedora while carrying a violin case concealing a tommy gun.
While it's a great position between partners, it looks ridiculous when trying to show intimacy.
Especially when they acted like they were snacking on each other.
I really love his wooden acting when he tries to tell Maria that he thought he buried Joey a long time ago.
In summary, from the moment Viggo's family crowded around the little girl because she had a nightmare and all were there to console her (in Cronenberg's hackneyed attempt to show Tom Stall's initially perfect existence) to the end when Tom/Joey/Michael Myers comes home to find his family tensely sitting at the dinner table and little girl Sarah pulls out a plate to show daddy Tom/Joey/Jason X is still part of the family, the movie was a complete package of one terribly directed clichÃ© after another.
He dies when he falls out of a second story window.
She has a shower scene and she appears to be laughing when she gets killed.
*SPOILER* The mirror people bellowing out the sound of the alarm is so cool, the mirror ghost suddenly appearing when the lights flash scared the s***t out of me, and the mirror itself - for an everyday inanimate object really does strike a nerve.
Naturally, things don't go as planned when Uncle Avery (J.P. Leubsen, the creepy guy from WITCHBOARD) starts to use his powers to kill everyone off.
Also with a showerhead through a neck, a black character when threatens, "I'll tapdance on your face like Bojangles Robinson!," a fat voyeur groundskeeper, an exploding head, blood that looks suspiciously like Cherry Kool-Aid, Tenney's trademark AWFUL wisecracks, Linnea in the shower, a possession, a human meltdown and much, much more.
At its heart, I think Ultimate Warrior wanted to highlight the differences and more importantly the similarities between "peaceful hippies" and "hardened men" such as Carson and how the two react when facing obstacles in a lawless environment.
The plot turns were all contrived and some of the action was incomprehensible -- why didn't the agents get off the bus when told to?
While it doesn't use African genocide as crudely as "Beyond Borders," it is painful to see a fictionalized story when the United Nations is right now doing so little about the horrors in Darfur, Nigeria, etc.
The climax with the megalomaniac mastermind is just plain foolish, particularly when we've seen how a real mass murderer ends up in "Downfall (Der Untergang)" - devoid of regrets or self-awareness, whereas here complex national politics are reduced to issues of individual actions and consequences.
What killed me was when Penn asked her who she met with in the park and she simply answers, 'it's personal'.
And when it becomes available on an anthology, buy it.
Before and after the film, when the director spoke, he seemed like a nice guy, and was certainly very cute--so, I wish him well in the future, but this is really bad first feature.
It's a shame when gay filmmakers like this Q. Allan Broka can get films like this made and provide free ammunition to the right wing who want to impede our freedom.
I was looking forward to see the connection growing between these two guys, and just when you think they are getting there, they decided to get a video together.
Then we are taken to another level here when the phones ring and is Caleb's flatmate (Jim Verranos) who can't honestly act (sorry to say this, sounds like a nice guy though) and the very hard to take Gwen, Marc's flatmate.
Sadly, I can't resist pointing out that, with the mainstream cinema and media still completely allergic to even most innocently presented displays of same-sex affection, not to mention actual sex, films like this still do have a function to fulfill, even when they fail to live up to its audience's expectations.
The two lead guys are hot to watch but not much to write home about when it comes to their acting abilities.
It's time the USA caught up with the rest of the world when it comes to the nude male form in film.
Why are people so impressed when an actor portrays a intoxicated lout who lacks self control?
Carroll Baker's character, for example, is initially portrayed as a real bitch that protects her poodle from the burning sun rather than to rescue fellow human beings, but when the climax approaches she suddenly transformed into one of the most amiable people on board.
It should also be remembered Kosminsky made the anti war documentary THE FALKLANDS - THE UNTOLD STORY about a black and white conflict , so for him to make a pro interventionist drama about a deeply complex war is very hypocritical   WARRIORS is only worth watching to see Damien Lewis and Ioan Gruffodd when they were both unknown actors
What Odile doesn't expect when she takes up an offer to join the couple on a trip to an isolated island estate is the Count Von Karlstein(Daniel Katz)and Countess Wanda Von Karlstein(Carmen CarriÃ³n)a wealthy elite who are also into kinky sex with sado-masochistic tendencies.
Odile's mistake in trusting in Mario's(Maura Ribera)'s bi-sexual wife(Mari Carmen Nieto)who is the culprit behind her seduction..what Odile does not realize is that when you travel down the road to passion and ecstasy, embracing the sexually free lifestyle she soon excepts with open arms, comes a dangerous price when associating yourself with the wrong person.
The last portion of the film has us entering the world of the Count and Countess, where we see how Odile's life will be threatened when their masochistic appetites emerge.
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I was perusing the Foreign section of the local video store of rare and hard to find films when I saw "El Topo" sitting plainly on the shelf.
Eventually, one of the women drops something, and when he bends over to pick it up for her, she pulls him to her inner thigh and then starts screaming out that he is advancing on her without her consent.
You know there's something wrong when even Robert Downey Jr. is uninteresting in a character that made me wonder why he chose to do the movie in the first place.
Also, they didn't get the lyrics right, but that's insignificant when compared to the larger problems of this movie.
Did the bus always stop there, even when there were no students?
I see others saying the acting was good when I read other reviews on this film and I only have to say one thing about that.. What are you people taking?
Personally I feel it would have been the smart move to kill off the main character when he shot up.
I have news for you, when it comes to low budget we want slashers, zombies or something with blood.
I rented this horrible B movie last night before checking out people's comments first.I will never make that mistake again.I couldn't even get a credit for another DVD after asking for a one at the video store because it's just their stupid policy not too because it's a renter beware thing or something.I thought the opening scene was a bit funny but knew from there it was no horror and could not get into it because it dragged on and was boring as hell.It was filmed in the same cheap same format as a daytime soap opera.I trusted the stupid cover art when it said nothing but good things about this movie.Even Fangoria gave it praise.I'm not sure I wanna read Fangoria anymore after being mislead.I don't understand how it could win anything.The idiot who made this film has no taste and it never should have even found distribution.
The characters talk in the same tone even when someone is ripped open right in front of them.
I would expect some screams when one is getting hacked in half, or their chest ripped open, but I think there were a total of 4 screams in the entire film.
At first glance, it was a little bit disappointment, when I saw Melissa P. I had an expectation that Melissa P. herself would have played in this movie.
In spite of the movie has been showed with the sign 18 circle, when we look at the scenes in reality it deserves a sign 15 circle.
As if Melissa quit these kinds of sex games and correct her communication with her mother forever when she realized she was in wrong way.
There is a point during film-making when a director or producer can simply say "Stop".
Synchronizing your actor's voices to match what they were saying when filming and the emotions they were feeling is not hard.
Anyone, and I mean anyone, who writes that this movie is any better than a 1, was watching a different movie when they were told they were watching this movie.
Sorry, but I'll hold out until I can find people that, when placed in a soggy paper bag and told to act, would be able to find their way back into the light.
I always hate it when I see people that say this about a movie, since with all the movies in the world, I find it hard to believe that so and so could be the worst movie ever made, but honestly, I promise you, believe me, for the love of God listen to me, this is the worst movie I have ever seen.
I remember seeing this movie when I was about six with my mom and thinking "Turbo is the coolest thing EVER."
Unless I am mistaken, I do believe that this episode, when aired on TV, began and ended with a segment featuring a very old Indiana Jones.
And maybe one of these days when I'm extra bored I'll watch chapter 2...that is if I haven't used the laserdiscs for frizbees by then.
If you've ever been stumped at a cocktail party when someone asks you, "what's the worst movie you've ever seen", you may want to rent this movie so as to have an instantaneous reply.
Just when I think it could not get worse they bring out a county rap group.
A pale husk of what roasts formerly were, I just hope for the day when the Friar's Club and Comedy Central make up and let them do the roasts again instead of Denis Leary's company.
Comedy Central apparently knew this when assembling the guest list for their "Roast of Jeff Foxworthy."
I have 'You Might Be A Redneck' on vinyl, and when you play it backwards it goes 'heeere's your sign!'"
I don't know what it is, but it may have to do with how old you were when you first saw it.
I'm guessing that when the movie was first released, a lot of guys took their dates to see it Â women typically love romantic themes, even when done badly Â and got laid that night or something, hence they remember it fondly.
If she is otherwise when I find her I shall be very put out".
We see some people standing along a road, when D.A.Pennebaker makes a fast pan, cutting to another fast pan to Dylan and Manuel, climbing the fortress of Kronborg, while a dog is barking.
As a huge fan of the original Indiana Jones movies, I must admit that I did not take to liking the young Indiana Jones Chronicles when i first watched them at the age of 7.
Audiences still don't know when they're being narratively cheated, or when a slightly promising idea has gone off the rails, or become a bloated, maddening mess.
I never ever imagined when I rented this that I would be swearing at the screen as the unbearable latter two thirds of this movie wore out their welcome.
But I also know well almost all the science fiction films made to date including those with serious as well as comic presentations and WALL-E does not rate well for me when compared to them.
While the basic story transposes rather well Â a down on his luck prospector who sold his wife and child for a gold claim and rose to rule the town that grew up around it finds himself on the road to destruction when they reappear and he attempts to make amends Â it's little more than an underdeveloped skeletal outline that never grips, feeling less an attempt at subtlety, more underwritten.
By the way, the reviewer who posted the plot summary at this site stated that Jovovich was the daughter, when it was actually Pollan.
There are some nice moments, most notably when Jovovich sings about Portugal.
He's the savior of the town and hero when he takes the role as sheriff.
It seems that he is pretty much lost when doing his own material.
For all its Technicolor and A-list casting, it's at heart a B-movie writ large, from the era when Saturday-morning horse opera serials were standard fare and big-budget Westerns were just taking off: the next thirty years would produce some classics of the genre, but this isn't one of them.
So why didn't I just turn it off when Van Johnston turned up as a British air marshall.
The uninteresting plot moves slowly and gets increasingly ridiculous, reaching a real low point when the murdered is revealed and explains his/her motives (they are just as unconvincing as their delivery).
Errol Flynn looked far more at home with a sword than a six shooter, but, while not John Wayne, he's fine here as the goodguy cowpoke pressed into service as Sheriff when things in Dodge get a little too nasty.
You have to see this when you get drunk though, because it will be a whole night full of laughs.
Not only that, just how dumb "Sam" or "Uncle Sam" really is when it comes to killing.
Damn that marketing ploy by the army in using toy soldiers in getting kids interested ;) Hell, I was a nut for plastic soldier figurines and creating battles when I was young.
The odd second half is when the 4th July parade starts and exploitation comes to boot with the killer being resurrected and knocking off victims who disrespected the American way of life and not supporting the troops.
The b-cast is more then decent when you see the names involved.
Larry Cohen is definitely a huge talent when it comes to entertaining horror movies - films like The Stuff, It's Alive and, of course, Maniac Cop are camp classics if you ask me; but he really should stick to entertainment, as this screenplay is a mess and the 'message' is so jumbled up that I have little idea what exactly it's preaching.
It's hard to take a movie about a war veteran zombie seriously, and this is something that Cohen should have taken into account when putting pen to paper.
If there is a bright side to this story, and I doubt there is, it is when the family receives their dead brother home in a casket, only to place him in the living room like furniture.
The best part of the movie was at the end when they fire the cannon at Uncle Sam and you can see the string pulling him back through the house.
What about when they ship Uncle Sam's body home to his sister's house.
The only good part was after the credits when they show an out-take of an actor actually being injured, but you have to sit through a poem that sounds like it was written by a third grader.
An awful film with some hilarious scenes, like when the family is on the table and enjoying their breakfast together, while the coffin of the dead Uncle is in the same room.
The mother was always p issed about her son when he did something good and she was praising her son when he was doing shenanigans.
In the end sequence, when Uncle Sam gets shot you can clearly see thick wires on his back reaching to the house.
A reasonable inference is that a LOT of dope is missing, yet when the box of narcotics is finally discovered in a locker at Grand Central Station, it's only big enough to contain, say, three dictionaries.
He's an Irishman with Burt Lancaster's habit of sticking out his jaw in a defiant scowl when he's angry.
And -- this being 1949, the year when the Cold War became an undeniable fact -- his Russian accent fits the temporal template.
In addition, how does the director expect us to be engaged by the story, when it is clear he has no interest in hearing what people have to say?
Ambush journalism fails when you are being aggressive without asking anything of import.
At first she does not like Hatton, blaming Wade for the death of her brother on a cattle drive but coming to love him when he shows his courage in opposing the men who make Dodge City a dangerous place to live.
Normally you settle for these videos when the popular titles are gone.
I will give it a second chance when I find it because as far as I know, it isn't available on DVD.
Ever since seeing it when first released I have waited to find a worse film.
Unlike Dead Boyz Can't Fly, however, I know when to leave well enough alone.
Miller and Adams never make the protagonists seem sympathetic until the middle of the action when Adams and two of his friends engineer an escape from a Federal prison and a grudge-totting Yankee officer chases them.
Initially, when I reviewed this film (which I bought at a Movie Gallery sale, I berated it as "Dull Mountain."
Usually when you see low budget camp slashers, it's rarely set at an actual camp-- usually in the woods under a tent.
Not because it is at all bad, but because there are way too many Friday The 13th fans out there who really are stubborn and ignorant when it comes to movies using the "formula", not to mention psycho horror movie fans who spend every minute of their day on message boards crap-talking movies.
Even when he portrayed himself in "To Hell and Back" his acting style is plodding and dull.
Stewart could play a role low key and then show a range of emotions when called on to do so - he was a true artist in that regard.
)It seems as though this show was scraped together after Invader Zim was released and when Jimmy Neutron was in production back in 2001.
At least Nick is still smart enough to know when they need to cancel shows.
Nickelodeon fans saw this, and suffered through it when it aired.
Patricia Clarkson gets the one and only laugh in the picture when she has her husband stop the car, gets out, and without saying a word crosses the highway and sticks out her thumb to hitchhike in the opposite direction.
Thus begins the long crazy nutty quest that will end when the twain shall meet.
The acting is quite simply atrocious, the plot and dialogue (when the cast remember the lines) is just awful and minimal in the usual way of teen horror flicks the story is just there to get to the next scary bit....sadly they seemed to have forgotten to put in both a story or any scary scenes.
Not to mention the only time they didn't touch was when you wanted them to!
The film begins with a woman realizing she needs to spend time alone because she's been having "difficult times" (so we can later explain why she thinks she must be crazy when she sees things), then the big house inherited from her dead aunt (low angle shots here, with blue lights behind dead trees, a la Amityville horror) and a bunch of bad acting locals who act unkind to this lady almost as if just because the script calls for it.
The plot thickens (kind of) when the woman finds her aunt's diary and learns that she was about to marry a preacher, but then dumped him for a Satanist!
But when it came to actually watching the feature.
Haunted house films in general don't go down well with me at the best of times, but when the haunted house film in question is as boring as The Hearse, you can guarantee it's not going to be a winner!
The locals treat her like dirt, especially when they learn Jane is the niece of the previous resident, who worshiped the devil and whose dead body mysteriously vanished when the hearse ran into a bridge and caught fire.
And just when you thought it was safe to go back into the shower... it is.
I saw this episode when i was 10 and i was shocked at the ending but looking back now it was only a pun.
Imagine my surprise when I found that some people seem to enjoy this terrifyingly bad piece of rubbish.
The only bit of excitement came when some crazy girl was going to dig into this guy's pants.
I found myself clinging to the edge of my seat when the movie was over.
The only way you can like this movie is if you love clip-art special effects, shoe string budgets (and when I say shoe string I mean the director literally sold his shoe strings to fund the movie when he should've just wrapped them around his neck and hung himself), and putting emphasis on the wrong syllables.
I am a horror fan, and love the premise of ghosts, haunted towns, and other supernatural elements in a movie when handled well.
Of confounding interest to other filmmakers may be the fact that EVIL CITY sold to distribution with almost no effort a few short weeks after availability of screeners; DVD's hit the chain store shelves in the U.S. so fast that a star of the film found out when hewent in to rent a movie and saw his name on a film box he didn't recognize ( the working title of EVIL'S CITY was THE LAZARUS SPORE, and then CROSSING ACHERON by wrap of photography ).
As for Willie "Sleep & Eat" Best as the hapless janitor trying to help Harold during his predicament, his character was WAY too stupid (such as the "hose scene") and it is horrible to hear the beloved Lloyd refer to this African-American comic as "Charcoal," (especially when one considers that Lloyd is usually kind and polite to Black and other nonwhite characters in his films).
Constantly being shipped from back and forth, between their divorced parents, takes it's toll on Josh and Sam and eventually reaches breaking point when their mum decides to marry and live in France for a year with a French guy.
The chicks aren't damsels-in-distress for long as when they decide to get revenge, all hell breaks lose.
Cause that's just what all lesbians do in their free time when they aren't fixing cars or playing softball.
I gotta be honest when going in to this film i was expecting not much but i at least thought it would have been a half decent cheesy horror movie with plentiful nudity there was in fact a lot of nudity but in this case it did the film no help.
None of these characters has any emotion when they spoke, they were all dried up, and nobody (the actors nor the director) seemed to care.
"Slipery when wet" ??????????
I like watching it when I'm really really really board which doesn't happen occasionally.
Oh, yeah since when does Sebastain have a heart?????
I don't usually write a comment when there are so many others but this time I feel I have to.
I have spoken of taste in another review, saying it's all in the eye of the beholder but when it comes to this film, if you like it, it simply means you have bad taste.
In "Fight Club" there are flashbacks at the end showing bits where Tyler's true identity was cryptically shown, and when you watched it again you saw more, it really was a work of genius, how it was written, laid out and directed.
Also, do you really think that when you reach 20+ you suddenly don't like any teenish story lines?
Besides, I was 16/17 when I first watched it.
When I'm at my most vulnerable, when I'm least able to handle them.
Robin Dunn isn't as bad as Adams, but he is absolutely terrible when compared to Ryan Phillipe.
I watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning, a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies.
I know that teenagers do have sex, sometimes a lot, but when done on film or television, is treated very seriously.
One famous sense was when Daneille encourages Cherie (who is around 14/15 in the film) to simulate sex on the back of a horse to the point where she has a orgasm.
The jokes in the film fall flat, whether if it's a verbal gag like 'she goes all moist when she sees you' to a visual gag where Sebastian pushes Kathryn face first into mud.
However when the movie starts to take form and Errol Flynn gets his sheriff-badge, the movie becomes interesting and also totally likable to watch.
Gerard Depardieu was 35 when this was made & he sure was very handsome & sexy.
Lucille Ball plays a dancer doing odd jobs who works as a decoy for the Yard when one of her friends mysteriously disappears and eventually shown to fallen victim to this maniacal killer.
The public obsession first began proper when the Cannon Film Group released the Sho Kosugi outing, Enter the Ninja in 1984.
So when I sat down to watch this movie last night I was extremely dissapointed.
The love story falls completely flat when you put Lukas Haas and Lisa Bonet together, I would agree with others that they have zero chemistry and I found myself gagging when they kissed.
She seemed too old for him and although she was good at her part when not romantic with Haas another actress may have been more appropriate.
That's okay with me-- I am not one of those novel Nazis who say that you can't change a thing when translating a work from one medium to another.
Filmed in Technicolor at a time when it was rare to see films in color, the cinematography (by Sol Polito who worked for Warner Bros and for Curtiz's films is very beautiful, owing to the fact it was filmed outdoors in Kansas-like landscapes and realistic-looking sets.
If you enjoy Errol Flynn (he did his own stunts at a time when no one did) and Olivia De Havilland, this film is highly enjoyable.
The premise seemed interesting, it's just a shame that what was such a good idea is closer to having nails pulled when watched.
And Flynn should have kissed her in the last scene when she agrees as a new bride to take the next wagon train west so he can clean up another lawless town.
(Unfortunately but inevitably, the tape had deteriorated significantly when I transferred it to DVD at the end of 2006.
I also wonder why here in the States we had to wait until September of 2002 to see it when the first comments about it, from a viewer in Turkey, are from February!
If we forget his American adventure (Arizona Dream), the decay of his movies was apparent already when "Underground" came out, but it was still bearable.
Well, you make his neurotic wife run away with somebody else, and then make him get mad when the girl puts on his wifes clothing and only later give in to his feelings.
Living there in Morgan City when the movie was filmed in the summer of 1992, we members of the press, at the press conference for this movie, laughed when told what the movie was going to be about.
Though everyone laughed, the joke was on Ernest Polk when Andrew slammed into Morgan City after taking out south Florida.
The move was okay but when the real hurricane met some of the sets that were used in the movie, like the Berwick Civic Center, Andrew, quite impolitely, removed roofing off of the walkways and such.
The left-wing fantasy is completed at the end of the film, when Americans are found scrambling for entry into Canada.
My wedding video is technically better, and my brother was drunk when he shot it.
How can you set out to make a documentary about asking someone out when the protagonist is such a pussy??
I rate movies 1 when I feel like turning it off, which was many times during this film.
By today's standards it is rather surprising that the Southerners are seen as the heroes and the Union cause identified with Surrett and the villains, but this was the era of "Gone with the Wind" when Hollywood tended to treat the Confederates as romantic rebels, if only because a film which treated them in any other way would have done no business anywhere south of Baltimore.
Hatton's romance with the beautiful Abbie gets off to a difficult start when he is forced to shoot her quarrelsome, drunken brother in self defence, but the course of true love soon starts to run more smoothly.
This whole things smells like when Sony created the fake critic David Manning to promote their movies.
The description on the cover suggested a real movie, so it was completely disappointing when it turned out to be someone's poorly done home movie.
So when they fail to get the date within 30 days they keep going (cheating!)
Even casting aside memories of the infamous summer of 2005, (during which the Internet Movie Database's Film General message board was overrun for months by the director's friends relentlessly hawking this documentary - and getting extremely unpleasant when challenged about their behaviour, trolling the board - in a monumentally misguided attempt at viral marketing that ensured everyone who encountered them waited for it to arrive on television rather than pay to see it) this film is impossible to like.
3,50 is not much, especially when it's says: The most funniest comedy since "There's something about Mary" starring: Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Mike Meyers, Alanna Ubach and many others... Alanna Ubach is the hot number from "Meet the Fockers" and Janeane Garofalo (which i personally like as well) known for her work with Ben Stiller on "Reality Bites", "Mystery Men" and lot's of other projects.
So, when I see him, I know not to care much about him or I'll just have my heart broken in the end!!
And in the morning when he wakes up his hair is the same, he just looks the same as he did the day before.
There is also a golf bit that is supposed to be funny - it may have been a little funny the first time but when they pulled the same bit at the end all it did was elicit eye-rolling moans in our little audience.
but when the mob wants Frank dead Frank is put into federal protection.
It is very important that as the movie industry your try to help us do the right thing when there are children involved.
Hard as it was to watch him be such a jerk to his girl, she was probably ideal for him, since she let him treat her poorly, run off when he needed to, he screwed up- she apologized.
Then the great journey home begins and the movie for a few minutes veers off into Bizarro World when Dupea picks up a pair of hippie, lesbian hitchhikers.
Catherine points this out to him when he asks her to show him some love.
For example when things go bad at his house he leaves and goes and gets drunk in a bar.
Then days later Elton is really taken from him when he is arrested so Bobby is totally alone.
However, when a new voice or new action that the penguins did came on screen, it was a pleasant laugh.
My first thought when watching this is how did they get such known celebrities to become involved in this.
They compromise some humor in an effort to tell a story, which will be hard to do when you are trying to do so with only stock footage.
Plus, at times I found the humor to be entertaining when the editing made it feel like their conversations were getting awkward.
There is this notion out there that Bob Saget is actually a funny guy when not playing a TV dad or hawking home video footage.
What was shown was simply Bob Saget reenacting his job as host of America's Funniest Home Videos when he used to provide voiceovers to the five second clips in order to make them only slightly more amusing.
For example, when one penguin farts in the movie, a large transparent red circle appears near it.
The reason I didn't give this a score of 1 was because I'll admit that I did laugh a few times, and I appreciate that the movie recognized itself as a bad movie, like when penguins from the March of the Penguins scoff at how dumb the humor is, when the writers are depicted as a monkey banging on a typewriter, and when Samuel L. Jackson apologizes for not having the budget to make the penguins' mouths move.
It's strange too that she look like an ex prom queen when in fact she was born in, where, Tokyo?
That was better than the time I saw Planes Trains, and automobiles when someones date was talking to me and her guy was getting angry.
The character played by Sammo Hung would fit to any grey-haired, eccentric kung fu master but when it poses to be the portrayal of a mythical Chinese sage like Zhang Sanfeng (Chang San-fung), it becomes too light even to be taken seriously.
there was a brief period -- say, early to mid 90's -- when miller seemed poised to step into the stand-up pantheon and take his place among the greats (richard pryor, lenny bruce, bill hicks, et al), but apparently somewhere along the line the devil showed up early to claim his soul.
Written for the screen by Jo Swerling from the novel by Vicente Blasco Ibanez it was directed with a certain amount of flair, it has to be said, by Rouben Mamoulian who just the previous year had had his greatest success with Tyrone Power when he directed him in the classic "Mark Of Zorro"  BLOOD & SAND recounts the story of a young, ambitious and quite naive bullfighter Juan Gallardo (Power) who falls under the spell of a beauteous and attractive socialite (Rita Hayworth) wrecking his relationship with Carmen (Linda Darnell) the girl who has always loved him since childhood.
And finally in the end when he is gored by a bull in the ring it is the forgiving Carmen, his only true love, that comes to his side to comfort him as he lays dying.
An engaging and totally ravishing piece that was used to greater effect in "Forbidden Games" in 1952 when it was played by guitar genius Narciso Yepes.
By all means, feel free to see it for yourself and email me a few more of your own:   1) At the beginning of the movie, when Eliot needs someone to drive him across the country, he asks a kid in a very small-town grocery store to do it, offering him $10,000 cash (which he pulls out of his shirt pocket).
And when she gets in and sees this, she takes it in with complete equanimity.
She doesn't mention to the kid driving that she knows who he is, she doesn't SMS any of her friends, and, in fact, she makes no comment regarding the fact that she's aware of the situation she's in until five minutes from the end of the movie, when she says, smugly, "I guess you know the words to this one" as she and Eliot share her headphones and listen to the group's song on her IPod.
Add to this the fact that 3), Eliot's face is still covered in blood from the previous night's attack when he walks into the choir room, and no one in the choir expresses the slightest alarm at this.
In addition to giving Flynn technicolor and his favorite leading lady Olivia DeHavilland, Warner Brothers gave him a script with an Indian attack, a wagon train, a saloon brawl, a cattle drive and the usual results when at the end of a cattle drive the cowboys start celebrating and one blazing railroad train.
Olivia DeHavilland hated this when it was first being made.
This film is supposed to show the traumaitzation of a man who was abused by a member of the Catholic Church when he was a young "boy".
I remember I was in the fifth grade when we were given the crash course on sex, so at that age I was 10 or 11.
After the one when the main heroine withdraws from the encounter with another guy, and rushes home, I really expected her to reach out and turn a stereo off, or something.
good sex scenes and some where a little yuck when she f**k the dude with her high-heel shoe.
As for the director, when was was the last time that he made anything that was good?
I honestly believe that he got lucky when he made The Exorcist although I do think that The French Connection was pretty good.
It is laughable and silly and the only thing that I kinda of enjoyed was when I realized that Caruso and Crenna were once in a film together 13 years before this one.
It was probably funny when they first met on the set after all that time.
She obviously hates having sex with her husband, but he wants her even more when he finds out she's rotten.
There was a time when my best friend and I, as teenagers, decided to see every single film that a local second-run multiplex carried.
We learned several things; one- parents of children are very suspicious of older males without children, when they are in a children's movie.
The voice-acting is great, of course, but I cringe when I think of what the movie makers put their talented cast through.
Maybe adults will find it cute, but I didn't like it at all, and I was in my early teens when I saw it.
It was a sad story, but the sadness just seemed to make me cringe-especially when the mice started to sing about it.
He's shown as the show-runner and creator when he was neither.
How were Spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrah's oral contract when the others were signed?
This is why, when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting Farrah up as the "bad girl" (like Suzanne Somers), it fails because the groundwork was never laid -- that was where the "Three's Company" pic delivered.
Ashore, they put on a dancing spectacle for the crew, who are drawn into romantic relationships with the natives while living on Tahiti when the Bounty is at anchor.
With the mix of races, and despite the inbreeding, the residents are strong and healthy, even when one individual with the Christian surname marries another.
The fact that IN THE WAKE OF THE BOUNTY carries forth its story to the final outcome for the mutineers was recognized by MGM when releasing its 1935 spectacular, when the studio bought the rights and used some footage in the 1935 promotional shorts PRIMITIVE PITCAIRN and PITCAIRN ISLAND TODAY.
It's just hard to suspend disbelief for "Bushy Bill" eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make-shift bio-dome sipping frosty mochcinno's with moxy.
They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE, and free of charge, you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters, eventually striking "pay-dirt" and fashioning a homemade Dr. Frankenstein-styled cancer-stick, all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of "Aqua Velva" on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise.
Much like Survivor, every week one member of the tribe "Leaves" the "Island" when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local Institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full-blown schizophrenia kicks into gear!
I remember watching it when it first came out.
I thought the film coped well with putting the complexity of codebreaking in a viewer-friendly way and accurately portrayed the dynamic of the communication challenges inherent when "suits" talk to "geeks".
Christopher Guest's movies work--when they do--because he uses comic actors & writers.
There was almost no excitement or tension to the poker tournament, perhaps because it is impossible to build tension in the results of a game when that game is severely edited.
The other problem is that it's really 'not funny'...The characters aren't funny...they are irritating and I get enough irritating people when I go out in public...and they are 'sometime (usually) funnier!...So for my money, it's a comedy..THAT IS NOT FUNNY...
She is insipidly awful when she tries to act and the plot is so ridiculous that one can't take it seriously, even within the context of a musical.
Actually tell a lie, the other good bit was when the woman went to the Chinese restaurant and got served chicken soup, but she wasn't satisfied with it so she call the waiter over.
Didn't you realize what an utter piece of garbage this was when you made it?
The aliens' mouths don't move, and their rubber limbs crumple and squeak when they are touched.
Another advertisement for Western enlightenment occurs when a snake bites one of the kids and his brother cleans the wound; Railsback insists on taking him to the hospital so he can receive competent treatment; when he asks the nurse how the kid is doing in the next scene, she goes "I have no idea - but I cleaned the wound."
OK back in 90whatever in the UK,the episodes of different series were not shown a year apart in order to catch up with the years and also since I didn't have a TV for most of 94/95 I ended up seeing episodes either on video or in whatever order they were on TV,so I saw them in totally the wrong order and never knew which ones were series 1,2,3 or 4 until 10 years later when I found an episode guide online.
At one point Nukie is almost enjoying himself, when suddenly he's interrupted by his brothers howl " NUUUKIIIEEAAAAGGHHH!!!".
This movie doesn't even sell on EBAY when listed for 99 cents.
Honestly, when I finally finished this movie I felt like dying(it took me a while because I watched about the first half hour and needed to stop on account of the utter idiocy of this movie).
It was hard to imagine when I first watched this just how devastating the hysteria over Satanic Ritual Abuse was to families and communities during the 1990s.
Ms. Paddock is remarkable in her power to dominate the episode, even when not on screen, and it's great to see the agents (to quote a later episode with similar themes) not knowing which side they're on.
People don't believe me when I tell them this, but I kind of like Nukie.
That's when you look for pointy objects to thrust violently into sensitive body parts as a distraction.
Just when you think the movie has reached its nadir, a character begins dancing, or one of the aliens demonstrates a new power, or the computer learns a new lesson about feelings, and your brain tries to escape the pain by squeezing out of your skull through the pores in the bone.
In some cases these movies amount to little more than 10 or so minutes of wild slapstick, and when the prints are in poor condition even rudimentary plot-lines become incoherent.
I mean was I the only one that wondered who the heck was the big guy that they featured when looking at the death eater yet never told you what he's purpose was.
This also means, they put in the attack/house fire to replace the Christmas holiday when Scrimgeour visits.
Now my fears are totally realized when this steaming heap of crap came out.
And there, dear aspiring filmmakers, is the when someone needs to take a good piece of hickory and break it across the front of your face, leaving a "Louisville Slugger" logo imprinted across your face.
Let me start by saying, I know that you have to alter and omit scenes from a novel when adapting it to the silver screen.
it is easily the 2nd biggest moment in seven novels, next to the climax when Voldemort is killed.
I along with many others had been devastated when I learned that Warner Brothers had pushed back the release date 6 months and had waited in the theatre for 3+ hours for a movie that I was anticipating to be one of my favorites in the series.
Who knows...maybe Ron will know if we ask him....How can you fear a wizard when you can't understand why he is the way that he is?
I loved the essence of the first two films, but when Alfonso Cuaron took over as the director of Prisoner of Azkaban, it seems more and more material had been cut from the books on which they are based.
In the movie, he makes out as if it could be any old thing, a shoe, a can, a piece of paper... (better get searching then Harry, I found the ring, because "Magic leaves traces", but when I die, you're screwed!!!)
Ya know, I never even shed a bloody tear when they killed Dumbledore.
But then again, it's getting great reviews, so I think I'm part of the minority of people who were really, really hoping to get a Harry Potter movie that would make JK Rowling proud, at least when she cared.
The Burrow burns down during x-mas break due to Bellatrix and Fenrir (who is never described as a werewolf) perhaps for the lack of action at the end of the movie...the Dursleys are completely cut from the movie, meaning when Dumbledore picks Harry up for the summer it's at the train station for some apparent reason...The Ginny/Dean/Harry dichotomy is skewed, there was no break up between Ginny and Dean and Harry is clearly in love with her from the start of the movie which eliminates his confusion on his feelings during the school year...Hermoine prematurely spills the beans on her feelings for Ron which was only speculation in the novels...Lavender Brown becomes a obsessive and crazed girlfriend rather than simply over-affectionate (a reminiscent Unis from She's the Man)...the battle scene is missing from the end giving Dumbledore's death an anticlimactic feel making it all the more unemotional and disappointing...Harry hides under the floor simply holding his wand looking like a coward while Dumbledore dies, Snape sees him hiding rather than Harry being frozen under his cloak compliments of Dumbledore ...There is no funeral or break up with Ginny at the end of it (there is no relationship between the two either simply a kiss)...Hagrid is basically deleted from the movie as is Neville...Pensive trips are deleted and the Horocruxes are never explained, not even slightly...Luna finds Harry on the Hogwarts Express rather than Tonks...The Slug Club simply makes a cameo rather than a proper introduction and explanation...the Inferi look more like skeletons compared to the white bodies described in the book...I'm sure more discrepancies are present, however I can only remember so many of them.
I mean I didn't even feel emotional when Dumbledore was killed, I was too busy trying to figure out why Harry was acting like a stunned coward under the floor boards and not doing something, isn't that his thing...doing seemingly impossible rescue missions?!?!
I'm not sure how anyone thought this movie was amazingly dark when the theater was cracking up laughing the entire time at trite jokes.
And can someone please tell me how they are going to explain Dobby and Kreacher in the Deathly Hallows movies when they have essentially been omitted from the subsequent movies after being introduced?
The best thing in this movie I would say, was the scenery; and the only good gag is when the friend of the boy is in the swimming pool with the blond girl.
The movie begins when a "fourth assistant undersecretary" named "Steve" is stripped and kidnapped with his girlfriend from an A-frame house.
So many choices, but the prize must go to Cheri Caffero's nightclub number when -- swathed in a cocoon of blue feathers -- she tries to sing and look sexy at the same time.
Now there's nothing wrong with that, but when you set her up as absolutely hating blacks in the first one, you stick to the character no matter how despicable.
Anyway when seeing this when it first came out it already seemed dated & cheesy.
I assume that when a play or drama is cast the actors will be able to fit their parts.
(One jeep goes hurtling off a road into a river; Hagman himself puts on a surprised, comic, almost cross-eyed face when he gets shot and tumbles down a flight of stairs.)
and (c) Why do the British military people continue to drive the fake Churchill to the manor house even when they know there are German paratroopers in the village?
Thirty some years after its release, it is now clear that The Eagle Has Landed was a plucked raptor when it fell out of Sturgis' respectable aerie into 1970s theaters.
I remember when I was in class once and a guy got arrested in class because he tried to run instead of just escorted out to the hall.
These scenes are relatively effective and the killer does have an ability to appear menacing, but there are also some ludicrous scenes thrown in and some weird, unexplained stuff, and fantastic leaps of logic needed when the end is revealed.
How was that possible when we finally do discover who the killer is?
If you start painting all your fingernails and toenails during the opening sequences, they will be completely dry when the movie ends.
The movie ends neither too soon, which would leave them still tacky when you got up to turn it off, nor does it run long enough to disqualify it as a good excuse to sit down and paint your nails and let them dry thoroughly before starting in on any other projects.
The British don't see it quite the same way, of course, and so Sam West eventually shows up in the arrogant twit Aryan bigot role to throw up on his boots when confronted with the grim realities of trench warfare.
Samuel West has hardly any lines in this movie, which is sort of a crime when you consider the folly of hiring one of the most golden-throated actors in all of England to be in your short flick, and then not giving him much more to say other than..."Ooof....urp.....glgugggggghhhrrggg....<splat>".
Above that a year after initial filming when I knew a little more about acting they called me back to shoot two pick up scenes (easy to spot as my hair was much shorter--it went from '79 to '80 nuff said).
In filming he actually seemed to be in the moment and connecting on an honest level when you were talking to him.
But the film sprung a leak as soon as we get to the Nautilus, and the results of a small fx budget start to really stand out: uniforms that looked like my mom sewed them for the class play, tons of stock footage of the same coral reef going by the porthole endlessly, a night scene where I could swear they used lightbulbs to simulate stars in the sky, and finally (when I gave up watching), an incredibly silly and fake-looking sea monster.
In one last point about another longtime thesp, Stephen Lang comes across very admirably.......and when you're able to do that when playing against Light's extraordinary performance, you really are accomplishing something.
But the adventure is just starting for the Professor, his daughter and harpooner Ned Land when they are washed overboard and picked up by the mysterious and sinister Captain Nemo in a futuristic submarine.
Some decent underwater shots is all it has to offer, though they add a goof with that as when Ugly Haircut admires the sight outside the Nautilus scuttle the ship would crash into the corals as the camera suggest it is floating sideways.
However, when effects like that are mixed with bad actors, a half baked storyline and a plot basing on the most ridiculous idea that 2 guys would actually compete over a woman with an abomination as a haircut you get a silly film in the end.
You may argue that Kirk Douglas building a guitar out of a turtle shell and singing songs to a seal is silly too, it is, but that's what you get when you see a Disney film.
Jules Verne must be spinning in his grave to see his excellent novel turned into a shoddy little romance for those who move their lips when they read.
The movie starts on good basis, but when it reaches the last third, it seems that Luc Besson had no inspiration for the end.
There are many interesting ideas, but when it comes to tie them all together, the end is mostly stolen from "Raiders of the Lost Arch".
How is it possible that only Jean Reno and his friend can survive the flooding of their room, when they are bonded and all the other people present have their arms free?
But it will have you laughing when the bad boss is killed at the end.
And Dell's character is so loud, obnoxious, and unfunny, that the single best line in the film, and perhaps it's most dramatic moment, occurs when Greunier tries to get him to shut up.
I saw this movie when i was about 14 years old, and i thought Disney's "Cinderella" was more frightening.
Actor/Actress are middle but it's not possible to be good when the story is so idiot.
One aspect of the script that works is how it keeps you at the edge of your seat so that you really do not know what is going to happen until the very end when it does happen.
Anything that has to do with Anctartica is going to be very interesting and even more when Horror is mixed on.
As a matter of fact, this film carries several Women-in-Prison characteristics such as the copious amounts of female nudity when the patients are in the showers(..there's even a hilarious cat fight between Vera and another patient over another woman ending in bare knuckle fisticuffs!).
One thing I remember when home video rental took off was people would hire films they`d never heard of , the only way you`d get an idea of what the film was like was reading the blurb on the back which often wouldn`t do justice as to how bad the film was , and let me say no blurb could ever do justice as to how awful THE MAD FOXES is.
Mad Foxes is just as ridiculous as it's meant to be and then some...however, while I enjoy a good silly flick, the inconstancies and illogical nature of the film don't help it as the plot doesn't move well at all, and the film gets confusing too often, which isn't good when the plot is as simple as the one here.
Even my Mother, who is old enough to have seen this when it was out in the theaters, said, " That was the worst movie I ever saw.
He soon goes off to fight in the Napoleonic Wars for 10 years and when he returns, he sees a radiant woman who he thinks can't be Hepburn because she seems so young.
Plenty has been written about the 'Fog of War'--that is, the fact that when the bullets start flying, not only do politics go out the window (regrettably the politics seems to have gone out the window when the film cameras started rolling as well), but so also do the best laid plans and what small levels of good sense there were to begin with.
So what we have is Scott afraid to make a movie about the fact that war goes wrong just because war always goes wrong, and instead making a movie about how war goes wrong because our Special Ops are populated with people who either can't breathe when the going is tough, or having seizures when the going is tough.
Once, you have that set-up, that's when the politics really is deplorable--because of the fall back on such idiocies as 'heroism' and just looking our for your friends.
There are obviously certain historic issues that need to be addressed, but when a movie is this dull anyway, who cares?
In my country there are a lot of people that want to see both sides of a developing conflict, especially when killing is involved.
The acting isn't so good and clearly shows especially when the film is watched numerous times.
The main issue though was the excessive amount of action that, to me isn't that bad but when it takes over the basis and substance of the story it becomes quite hard to continue watching.
), therefore it is impossible to relate to or care about anyone, even more so when they choke out the typical "Tell my wife and kids..." line.
Personality is overrated, anyway--especially when the gory consequences of war are shoved in your face with unflinching horror!
Ridley Scott says that he came to the project without politics, which is what people often say when they subscribe to the dominant point of view.
Many years later, when the cast of the Saturday morning TV series, Saved By the Bell, became too old looking to be high school students, they graduated them and put in different students.
Both License To Kill and Casino Royale have been praised as "a return to the Fleming spirit", when in truth they are nothing more than shameless attempts to cash in on popular fads of their time: the Bronson / Arnold / Stallone action films of the 80s in the case of License, the Bourne / Transporter films in the case of Casino.
CR: Bond attaches bombs to bad guys, smiles in a sinister way when they blow up.
Has a villain who plays the stock market, and when that fails... plays poker.
Sometimes when we want to innovate ,we burn our past.Children with guns in Africa !!!!
Sometimes when we want to innovate ,we burn our past!
A Bond who falls in love then cries his eyes out when she dies?
There was a brief glimmer of hope when Craig returns from the near death poisoning experience to the poker table and says "sorry about that, that last hand nearly killed me."
There is no coolness factor to Bond here, especially when the film turns into THE NOTEBOOK in the last act.
Green was 25-years-old when 'ROYALE' was shot, Craig was 38 and looking over 40.
Why would security guys run towards the car to find out what has happened when there are security cameras in the security room which was left open for Bond to use the equipment???
Bond goes around a couple of curves and unintentionally (when was the last time Bond unintentionally?)
Just like everyone else, when I first saw that Daniel Craig was to replace Pierce Brosnan in the role, I was a bit confused.
If you go to utube and watch the series, you will see that this show was made from the time when they used to put decent parents and respectful (NORMAL) kids into our daily lives.
Having never even heard of it when it was released, I just now finished watching it, and was deeply moved by its even-handedness and lack of melodrama.
Shame on you for making this movie when you could have spent all that money on charities or on making several, cheaper, but much better movies.
I do not have any idea what the director or actors/actresses were thinking when they agreed to make this very poor example of a film.
It's only when Holly, an adoring, unassuming graduate student from England (Anna Friel, of TV's "Pushing Daisies"), expresses her belief in him that he reconsiders his theory.
It's easy to see when a comedian becomes so full of himself in a movie after a history of exceptionally funny ones.
My friends invited me to go along and see this film when it came out.
I broke my conviction on seeing this movie when my eleven-year-old insisted on seeing it for a buck.
I did not watch any trailer before going to watch this movie I just decided to watch it when I saw some posters of it in Manila and I did not even read any review or comment about this movie before going to watch it.
And when not being chased, the aimlessness doesn't stop, it just gets more persistent.
As the professor sets off to work, he and his wife are approached by their elderly neighbor Mrs. Niemoller who complains timidly that the boys in the neighborhood, including Timmy, make too much noise when they play and also heedlessly trample her garden.
Incidentally, Milland meets Hagen when he knocks on her door to complain about the loudness of the classical music coming from her phonograph player.
At one point she refers to his "big, thick head," when in fact his head is smaller than hers!
One memorable scene in this movie is when Gayle tells Mark, "I don't change people.
I hate this movie so much with love.I love French Stewart,but I hate him in this.This film makes no sense what so ever.How did claw get old when this film takes place 4 years later.Why didn't penny get older.Why does the town look different.Why is Gadget still stupid when his glitches are fix.Why ask why.This is stupid.Too many question,none of the answers.
I couldn't wait til this movie would finally be released and when I got it for my birthday I couldn't wait to go home and watch it, but after seeing i felt like i wasted my aunt's money.
I thought when I saw the first version, he would have played a much better character than Matthew Broderick.
Later, I was excited when I learned French had been cast for the role.
There was no chemistry between anyone, and when the clichÃ©s began to cause a horrid avalanche, I was caught with nowhere to hide.
So, when it comes to this film Â just don't do it.
I thought that the first was bad enough, but when I saw this I was shocked.
It becomes even more amazing that they pulled this off when the movie makers undoubtedly were working on a shoe-string budget.
Toho came to it's senses when they moved on to Godzilla vs Destroyah and reinstated the classic Akira Ifukube cues.
Oh, and somehow both of these are not only your size, but the space critter no longer has an entire carapace of crystals attached to his back when he arrives on earth.
Ruthless crime boss Randall (Paul Murphy) is intent on seizing control of SouthEast England's cocaine business, and is willing to kill anyone who stands in his way; but Randall bites off more than he can chew when he double-crosses fearless hit-man Walker (Nick Rendell).
I should have known when I saw Glenn Frey of the Eagles listed as one of the cast.
Director Stuart Rosenberg was so dismayed when he surveyed the finished film that he had his name taken off the credits.
I was a young teen when I saw this but was still on a high from "Star Wars".
Plus, when you have Darren "Carl Kolchak" McGavin studying the aliens, one can only envision Christopher Lloyd getting his inspiration for "Back to the Future", and that's not a good thing.
You know who's going to die, and when.
I love it when Tom and Jerry get away from their usual domestic setting to cause havoc somewhere new, and the seaside proves to be the ideal locale for plenty of inventive mayhem and violent hi-jinx: the cat and mouse get in trouble with a cantankerous crab, who is keen to use his pincers on the duo whenever possible; Jerry gets Tom to swallow sand, break his teeth on a shell sandwich, and leap head first onto a wooden post (which the cat is tricked into thinking is a drowning woman); Jerry is launched from a soda bottle into the sea; and Tom swallows an inflatable horse.
You'd be much better off seeing the anime (which is excellent) or maybe watching "L" when it comes out next year, because the same actor is in it.
Even more disappointing when you see former PM Entertainment exec Joseph Merhi is a producer on this.
They couldn't even agree upon the time of day (when in doubt, take wristwatches off your performers and off the walls of the sets.
It was when he noticed the co-writer's name in a dictionary.
However, the most hilarious moments of this short are when Tom drinks sand instead of sugar in the coffee.
But the problem is when you see L , you really start expecting something smart, something intelligent.
Believe me, when you see L on the screen, you will start thinking that he is upto something, or he will come out with something smart and surprising.
But you know something's wrong when your counting the good moments rather than the bad ones.
As usual, when McShane is on screen, you cannot take your eyes off him.
I'll agree that the movie is indeed awful, but it nevertheless brought a nostalgic smile when I came across the title as I was looking up some information on Ian McShane now that I have caught up on all the Deadwood episodes but still find myself wanting to see more of him.
I saw this movie when it first came out, over 20 years ago, and have continuously referred to it as the worst movie ever made.
If you want to see a movie about things that will happen when you stop taking your medication, then this is a movie to see.
He begins receiving mysterious phone calls concerning the girl and develops a perverted pleasure when he realizes that she will only consume blood.
I guess, the fact that the main character is insane might be enough of an excuse to push the bizarre factor to the extreme, but when a movie makes as very little sense as this one did, I cannot recommend it.
In the end is the Queen of vampires played by the eternal vampire Arly Jover (Blade) surrounded by an army of vampires, but when the "fantastic" slayers arrive only 4 vampires are left!!
And what about the "Grand Finally" when Bon Jovi blows her head with a shotgun???
At least he looks happy when he is smiling.
These scenes have so little suspense or build-up that when they happen it is almost funny, and there is no "horror" pay-off from the scene.
Aside from all of the other silly moments, there is a transfusion sequence when Natasha Wagner has all her Vampire blood removed, and the town people all line up to donate blood for her transfusion.
Tom is out for a fun day at the beach, but everything turns out to be a disaster, right from the start when his bathing suit gets stuck in the door!
I mean any normal person would suspect something is up when a strange woman suddenly appearing out of nowhere to seduce you, let alone an experienced hunter.
The plot is the kind of thing that deluded teenagers churn out when they're going through that "I could write a book/screenplay/award winning sitcom" phase.
A beautiful opportunity to use the classic sex and vampirism parallel is passed up when, in order to infect Bon Jovi's character with vampire blood from his ailing co-hunter, he is given a transfusion.
I know the first Vampires being set in New Mexico wasn't exactly the twilight zone in terms of creepiness but yet it still managed to be dark and foreboding when it needed to be.
Gavin's sweet happiness when he exclaimed, " at last, I got you something you really like" broke my heart!
The character of George was a stone cold witch and she proved it until the end when she intruded on Gavin's funeral like an unwelcome guest to hurt his wife (who had truly loved him and shared her life with him) only to reminded her that that she hadn't had all of his love!
I am an animal lover, and when I heard Animal Planet was going to show the story of military dogs in Vietnam, I was excited.
i know the public is meant to suspend your disbelief when you watch films, but this is the extent.
It is hard to like a movie when the story is unremittingly violent and barbaric while the characters are cold and (Donovan excepted) unappealing to look at.
Mostly it turns you on in the beginning, sliding through the story, keeping you thinking - when starts the thrill.
Lovecraft is incredibly difficult to translate into a movie Â only gifted directors like Stuart Gordon and Lucio Fulci occasionally succeeded Â and his devoted fans are very finicky when it comes to adaptations.
I watched the original version of this movie when I was a child ("Es geschah am hellichten Tag" -- 1958), and I remember it as a very nice experience.
The scenes of Kirk with Odona on the empty duplicate copy of the Enterprise on Gideon also don't make much sense especially when you consider that the planet is supposed to be chronically overpopulated.
The Gideon council chamber created so much free space for one man when they could have solved their overpopulation problem by having Kirk transport Odona to Dr. McCoy's sickbay for treatment?
There is a memorable line which Spock says when Starfleet and its officials refuse to give him permission to beam down to Gideon and locate Kirk: "Diplomats and bureaucrats may function differently but they achieve exactly the same results."
4) Since when does Kirk beam-down without a communicator?
There is a sadistic male warden (Herbert Lom) who coerces one of the female prisoners into seducing Marie for his pleasure, and there is one un-named prison guard who has the most hilarious facial expressions when introducing guests to McCambridge, but the rest of the film falls flat.
Maria Schell is not in the film nearly enough, and when she is, it's hard to determine what her true agenda is.
Simon saw "Mr. Travati" walking down the passageway of the hospital, hooked to an IV bottle, when he was brought after the car accident.
The "2002" was actually 20:02, military time (8:02 PM), when the emergency room doctor called Simon's death.
But such movies like "Der Heisse Tod"/"99 Women" (1969) still stand here in the now historic landscape like monuments of an epoch when the level of the German film sank below zero.
Sarah makes odd sounds when she sleeps, takes lots of medication, feels tired and cold on occasion, but spends most of her considerable energy, and apparently limited lifetime, prattling.
The Haunting of Seacliff Inn is set on the picturesque Californian coast & starts with Susan (Ally Sheedy) & Mark Enright (William R. Moses) looking to buy some property with the idea of converting it into a seaside inn when Susan spots a beautiful old house sitting on a cliff overlooking a beach.
The script by Klenhard & Tom Walla is far too pedestrian for my liking, nothing significant happens for long stretches, in fact when I think about it nothing particularly significant happens during the films entire 90 plus minute duration.
However there's not much acting to be had; with a script bereft of substantial dialogue and a fair smattering of time-consuming stunts, our two heroes mainly just get to bark at each other and mug at the lens, all the more surprising when you appreciate the screenplay is by William Goldman, late scriptor of "Butch Cassidy", the epitome of "buddy" movies and its little brother, the soon-come "The Sting".
Sometimes I get the impression when the produces/director/cast/crew for the "made-for-tv" movies cross the border into Canada (as they often do,), some sort or ray or odorless gas descends upon them -- causing movies to be less than they otherwise should be.
Without the ending Hangman would have been a decent thriller even with some really bad dialogue and plot holes the size of Texas but when the credits roll in you just feel like you wasted precious minutes of your life that you'll wish you had when death comes for you.
Just like the TV series "Lost", it seems all exciting while you watch and wait anxiously for the ending, which is supposed to explain everything, but when it ends, nothing is explained.
I must say though the sound effects for when they are fighting are top notch, the sound effects are so crisp and satisfying and ACTUALLY sound like punches not "PHsHHH" slashing noises from FUNImation... also out of the 3 Pioneer movies "Dead Zone, The Worlds Strongest" and "Tree Of Might" this one has the most stupidest lines!
There are some nifty miniature settings to recreate the destructive sequences that cost too much to film with real equipment and the monster Â when you eventually get to see it in all its glory near the very end Â is quite a massive and reasonably admirable construction.
I`ve very little to say on this except that I disliked THE EVIL DEAD movies and I disliked SEVERED TIES and it seems really unfair that films like this use an obscene amount of rubber when the third world is crying out for condoms
A young scientist is trying to carry on his dead father's work on limb regeneration.His overbearing mother has convinced him that he murdered his own father and is monitoring his progress for her own evil purposes.A young doctor uses reptilian DNA he extracts from a large creature and when his arm is conveniently ripped off a few minutes later,he injects himself with his formula and grows a new murderous arm...Admittedly the special effects in "Severed Ties" are pretty good and grotesque,but the rest of the film is awful.The severed arm is behaving like a snake and kills few people.Big deal.The acting is mediocre and the climax is silly.3 out of 10.
O'Brien's a bootlegger and when his warehouse is raided, Junior takes the fall because he won't rat out his pal.
What happened to the days when shows like MacGyver and cartoons like Duck Tales were on television?
When I enjoy a new show for a season or two but then find it growing stale or repetitive or degenerating into self-parody, prompting me to stop planning to see it and eventually to turn it off when I happen across it accidentally, that's a show that I will give a vote of 3 and then write a comment explaining that I'm not panning the entire run of the show but only the later seasons.
That is better than playing across from Newman or Steiger when it comes to bringing out true acting talent.
That's when carnival barker Eddie (Lee Tracy of "Bombshell") finds himself lured into the story.
Peggy blows her cover when she warns Eddie about a plot to murder him by his Japanese employers.
Yes, Eddie is so incredibly cretinous that he does things that a four-year old would never do when he tries to outwit the Japanese.
The only part which is interesting and funny is the part when he's naked and running around, fighting the bad guys.
Silly as it is with things on the cover that aren't in the film, the dubbing is utterly painful - totally out of synch - and when the story is as fragmented as is the case in the version I saw, one has to wonder if the dubbing missed out things, or if the Danish version has been cut, because the storyline is pretty much impossible to understand.
This comes as no surprise, especially when we know that the story got changed from the Chinese to the English version.
Since Alex has written, for therapeutic reasons, a not-for-publication autobiography, her supervisor, after learning of the opus, determines that she must be eliminated, and during her flight from homicidal pursuers, she unites with a discredited demolition expert, Will Rickman (Scott Glenn), who is fighting a lawsuit originating from two accidental deaths within his most recently demolished building and the pair exchange sexual bouquets when not avoiding being killed.
Reba does save the life of Kenny Rogers(Hawke) from the Mexican gallows when wrongly accused of cheating at cards.
I remember liking this movie when I first watched it but when I bought both DVD's of The Ring and Ring 2 I actually fell asleep, and I've never fallen asleep during a movie.
After all, she knows Samara has returned for them, yet when Aidan has a nightmare that he refuses to share with her, his temperature drops five degrees and he starts acting really weird, she still is entirely clueless to what's going on.
The first film was truly scary, and kept you on the edge of your seat, and when the end came it ripped you out of your seat.
There are several points in this movie when you feel like you begin to catch on to something that will eventually make sense (and make it worth your money), only to be let down at the conclusion of the scene.
Oh, and when the mother uses the F-word for effect - what a cheap movie ploy.
A sequel succeeds when it extends the story, not just retells it.
I mean, how many years was Samara at the bottom of that "SEALED" well and she seemed to have no problem getting out and about when she felt like it.
And when did Samara ever have a problem finding someone she was looking for?
What happens when you go to the cinema to watch "Just My Luck" but it is sold out, and so is "RV" and "United 93", and "The Ant Bully" and, believe it or not, "Curious George" where films you could see earlier?
The movie is so bad that it only gets interesting when the music is as bad as it: Ponchieli, Dukas, Mussorgsky, etc.
I grew up with this show and the images of that car jumping, the country scenes, the ethics and simplicity of the series, captured my imagination back when I was a child.
I even watched Sonny Shroyer when he did his short-lived spin off and I enjoyed the "Reunion" TV movie done in 1997, but this title isn't even worth the paper the script was printed on!
I found myself sighing with relief when I got through with it, and the sigh was that I was able to make it through without actually turning the movie off!
Any fan of the show would know that this episode(don't know when it aired but certainly not in the last year of the show) ends with Matt meeting Kitty and sort of convincing her to come back, which she does.
It's going to get hotter and the polar bears will probably die when that happens.
Your kids will cry when they find out the bears are going to die.
I've never planted a tree and when I do plant--um--plants they are usually the dark green kind of plants that absorb a lot of sunlight and radiate a ton of heat causing even more global warming.
My biggest problem with this show is that they play it off as a documentary, when it is NOT.
Now Just when you think the plot gets going somewhere, there's another cut to the bad guy (presumably the bad guy, he's really a scrawny kid) with his henchmen dropping nun-chucks on their feet and weather he's real or not isn't entirely clear as we cut once again to the 3 main characters and another training montage that is entirely identical to all the others before it.
I honestly question the mental health of the writers and seriously wonder if some of them were on drugs when I watch this scene, it makes me cry every time cause it hurts so very much.
These supposed kids were supposed to be black belts when they look like they should be wearing yellow belts.
The dialogue sounds like it was written by a 7 year old, the acting is atrocious (you can tell the people are reading off the script), there is absolutely no plot whatsoever, new characters are introduced out of nowhere and they don't even have a purpose to being in the movie, the camera work is laughable, the action scenes are the worst I have ever seen in my entire life, editing was so bad it was noticeable when scenes were cut out and replaced, the music was terrible (it didn't add anything to the scenes it made the scenes even more confusing and horrific), and the wardrobe was just rediculous (In a bad, bad way).
When I saw this movie, I thought of it as a cheap rip of the Butterfly Effect, but when I saw the year when this movie was released it might be the otherwise.
I hate to say this about a low budget film, especially when i know that the creators are trying, but I couldn't get into this.
There's some interesting humor in some exchanges between two of the main characters, and when the film is over, there are some well done credit images.
3 NINJAS almost worked, i loved the film when I was 2, but it lacked some appeal.
We almost fell on the ground when we first found out who the evil boss is.
I guess this is what you get when people without skills or talent try to make a movie.
His relationship with his wealthy family could have been interesting, however, we only see them in the briefest of scenes, and are not even sure who his father is until the final line of that scene when he calls a man "dad".
They feel smart when they recognize the reference.
He really doesn't do much other then driving the car and telling bad jokes (and supplying his own annoying laugh to tell you when something he says is funny).
There, he will leave and does not appear until the end of the show when the person comes back to pick up their car.
They will usually go over-the-top when "pimping" the car, adding at least 4 TVs per car and other expensive and unneeded items you would not use while in your car.
If your thinking of watching this, I would seriously think twice, due to the poor acting, little tips though... when you place a false hand made of silicon or rubber.. make sure that you don't shine a light onto that prop, and for the woman in stockings when you act dead, try not to clasp your hand around the other actors hand and most important of all... ( Don't Blink ) I am not going to spoil it for you guys as thats the type of person I am, so if your going to watch it.. good luck, oh by the way..
So, what better way to celebrate Halloween years later than to have a internet-camera view of every room during one night when a bunch of teens have sex in nearly every room for paying customers on0line to see (after, you know, conjuring the dead back to life in a wedgie-board set-up)?
This movie looks great when adverstised on the back of its box, but it was deathly awful having to watch it.
There were some beautifully placed dark and gloomy scenes, and a wonderful recreation of the act of dying and being brought back to life (exactly the way my grandfather described it to me when it happened to him... not to say that each resuscitation isn't unique and individual, but we do hear of a common trend: see the white light; see your body below you).
I think The Phantom of the Movies summed it up best in his review when he said, "it may well be the best 1943 war movie made in 1987."
By the way, I took an instant dislike to Montgomery when I first saw him in "Mr. And Mrs. Smith", and his performance in "June Bride" did nothing to alter my opinion.
Three years ago the two were almost ready to get married when he got cold feet and walked out on her.
Along the way, Carey decides to mix things up a bit when he discovers that the bride is marrying the brother of her ex-fiancÃ©e, and her sister is actually in love with the groom-to-be.
One wonders what went through Bette Davis's mind during the final scene, considering that this movie was made at time when she was having her famous contract feuds with the Warner Brothers.
In a pre-Code, Davis would have simply said, "Well, look me up when you're next in town and we'll hit the hay.
I was just thinking something to watch when I was bored and a little like the pacifier in terms of comedies with a baby... but with baby-napping...
There is no funny at all at least when I gave up at 45 minutes into it... Everyone's life sucks, main characters are: Jerk Of The Year, Jackie as Loser Gambler, Blind Dude with insane depressed wife... No part of it is happy...
It's just incomprehensible why when he needs no padding in his career he would subject anyone to this drivel.
Griffith strikes out as a police woman who goes undercover in New York's Hissidic Jewish community to solve the disappearance of a young jewelry shop keeper whom she ultimately discovers murdered..From one of the opening scenes when Griffith asserts her character as a tough talking, trigger happy cowboy, or girl in this instance, we know the plot is headed for ridicule.
Then things really take a turn for the absurd when one of the young potential Rabbis turns out to be disguised hunk Eric Thal.
And grows even more ludicrous when Griffith, with the help of one the young Hissidic girls ( Mia Sara ) gets a total Jewish makeover to go undercover as one of their own.
Thal is appropriately stoic throughout most of the film, but that skill betrays him when his big emotional scene comes and he proves himself not up to the task.
When the mobsters come back, they are arrested for extortion and conspiracy; and when one of Yaakov's diamond bags is discovered in Baldessari's coat, for suspicion of murder.
The sound score is a never ending string and choir act that doesn't add much for me, I just sat there wondering when all the racket would end.
ACTING/LINES The actors were way too aware of that this was a Swedish blockbuster, and when they played their rolls, one could see an All to relaxed (not living into their characters) actors.
I mean I can't believe that the Swedish language/accent hasn't change since 1150-2007Â The lines was empty and when the accents was so poor, this equaled in very low performance, and I sometimes felt that I was watching Swedish Big BrotherÂ I think this is because Swedish actors has not yet understood that acting is with whole body, eye moves, body-language, etc, not just standing there like a jukebox and saying your lines one after other.
I mean, when you're supposed to create a flashback, you want to do it good, like "I am Legend".
In Elizabeth the golden age, when they ride their horses, one catches that freedom, speed, carriage/attitude I am talking about.
Anyway, when he had a "bad intention", Simon chose the wrong road, because it eventually led to him getting involved in a car crash, and Anna blackmailing him.
When he had a "good intention" (when revisiting the past and trying to change things around), Simon chose the "good" road (the one to the hospital).
This movie's only redeeming features are the moments when you cant help laughing out loud at the overblown clichÃ©s.
Such as when Arn is sad and riding through the rain.
Or when Cecila is happy and starts to dance.
This leads to some cinematic problems, as always when you do this.
However I was utterly disappointed last night when I saw it.
I'm not sure what the director thought about when he made this movie, but I guess he thought that he could make about 100 scenes with people saying 2-3 lines, then another 100 scenes of scenery.
I looked so much forward to this film when it came out (had read the books), but was very disappointed.
Those people are greatly disappointed when they after a first introduction action scene, are turned back to calm scenes in the description of the Arn's childhood and youth.
Like when Banta gets stuck in the aliens' sticky web and the guys sit around for two days debating whether to go try to rescue her, all while they can clearly see from afar that the aliens are trying to conduct experiments on her.
this only shows that the twist is a poor gimmick that's easy to fall for at first, but when you rewind the movie in your head in light of it, you find it just doesn't work and the whole movie just doesn't make sense.
The director also thought he was being clever giving subtle clues that maybe Marie was a little nutty herself and that's great, but it's not clever when the killer is introduced as clearly a totally separate entity.
At least in Fight Club you never see anyone speak to both Brad Pitt and Ed Norton at any one time, they are never together with extra people and recognized as separate entities and when the flashbacks show they're the same it makes sense.
having the point of view switch when the cops see the video was not only jolting but bad movie making, because there was no reason beyond confusing the audience with facts that can't possibly fit the film thus far.
I can't believe this has got rave reviews from critics and moviegoers; it baffles me when the same people slag off Paul W Anderson and Uwe Bowl yet praise this pile of donkey shite.
I don't mind a horror film that stretches the logic barrier, I love David Cronenberg's strange and weird tales, but when this film does a Fight Club out of the blue, your left shouting at the screen WHAT???
Why worry about serotonin levels when you are making a clone?
Is all that necessary when making clone?
the movie portrayed godzilla as a crafty but mindless animal, so that when they finally killed him, the audience is saddened rather than happy about it.
But when word got around, it's no surprise that it was quickly forgotten (or at the very least, people TRIED to forget it).
Not everyone enjoys that when going to the movies.
After seeing all the reviews from other users, I was excited when the film was released in Tucson, Arizona.
It went down the way of the magical realism that we all laughed at when watching films such as Zapata.
This just added to the eye-rolling I experienced when watching the film.
She is a beautiful rag doll, and your only response when she is mistreated is to hope that getting taken for granted or slapped around (and her bleating sorrow that follows) won't mar her features.
In a general way, of course, you hate to see a movie doing some of the things to a character that are done to Joanna unless there is some point to be made, and the best point that could be made in this kind of Candide story when, for instance, Joanna's boyfriend philosophizes that women want to be treated rough and then he does just that -- as I'm saying, the best point that could be made from this is that this is the way the world is, here are some of the terrible cracks exposed in the world Joanna lives in.
I'm sure that writer-director Mike Sarne thought he was developing a new cinematic paradigm when he was making Joanna, but the end result is less than satisfying.
I can still remember what those still left in the theater, towards the end, spontaneously and simultaneously yelled at the screen when Joanna said "I'll be back!"
But, when one sees his single picture of note, JOANNA, on the big screen in a rare public showing - One discovers that the film world did not lose much.
The special effects sequences almost border on parody, not at all scary, but more unintentionally hilarious, such as when Robbie's(Oliver Robins)braces go amok or when Steve(Craig T Nelson)swallows a "possessed" worm in a Tequilla bottle, with Kane attempting to use him to harm his family, regurgitating it!
You have lots of special effects as Kane's supernatural power surfaces when Steve allowed him into the house(..such as an electrical wire and running chainsaw that go berserk)and icky creatures designed by HR Geiger.
It's difficult to watch a movie about evil characters trying to kill Heather when you know she died as a kid in real life.
The scene when Craig Nelson vomits that monster is stupid.
The make-up and special effects are visually good and that's especially when it picks up towards the end.
Some problems that the film faced are that there are too much dwelling on what happened in the first film, the film's pace is quite slow, rather humourless, some rather meaningless scenes, a lot of talking that has no real interest and overall it's rather a pointless sequel with no meaning to the narrative when it finally finishes.
Zelda Rubinstein isn't as annoying like in "Poltergeist", with a far less eccentric performance, but when on screen she's rather tame.
Pointless scenes drag on, filled with boring dialog about the family's power when they work together, blah, blah, blah, and the characters all become so annoying that you'll wear out your fast forward button.
Any decent horror movie worth its salt has suspense, or tries to utilise it because that is what terror is all about, the long silences waiting for something to happen, the build up to it... Poltergeist 2 simply does not even try in this area,For example when carol Anne sees Kane at the mall, menacing and staring at her, in order to build up the tension, Director Brian Gibson didn't need to show us that Kane was a ghost, any director with any idea of suspense would have let us make up our own minds, as soon as we see Kane walking through people and things we know straight away what he is and any suspense vanishes.
We soon learn that he has been in this hospital before, in 2000, which is when his brother Peter was killed.
But when his friends show up to party at the cabin, Steve has to keep them from figuring out that Amy's now a zombie.
Its best gags are ripped off wholesale from The Simpsons' 'Krusty Gets Busted' episode, the remaining gags are insultingly bad, and the casting is ill-judged (note to filmmakers: when the sidekick's funnier than the lead your film's in trouble).
I was both startled and disappointed, then, when he began laughing with the voice of a young teenager.
People only laugh for extended periods (without anything funny happening) when they are exceptionally tired or drunk, and the laughter in the film didn't seem to be caused by either of these.
But as The I Inside and that film were actually completed at about the same time, it seems like another of those too-numerous-for-coincidence eras when there was "something in the air" that led to a number of similar films.
It's even more complicated than that, as when he's playing the character in the previous temporal setting, he has to be two characters at once--the character as he was when that temporal setting initially occurred, and the character from the later temporal setting experiencing it again, as a voyeur, while piecing together the puzzle.
Unfortunately, when one gets into the interior sets, something goes awry.
Then again, more resolution (and yes, a 1.66:1 presentation has more resolution when 16:9 enhanced) means that the flaws in the image are easier to make out.
I was really excited when I saw a promo pic and a trailer for it but I was utterly disappointed when I finally confronted the real thing.
I have been watching the Star Wars movies religiously ever since I was a youngling and I know when someone does credit to the Star Wars Universe (Even if Episodes I and II didn't, lol) and this movie does not.
Talking about kids play, I remember when I saw "Alien VS Predator", I was very impressed about special effects but very bad impressed about actors.
Overall, I have to give the people involved in this short a hearty pat on the back for effort, especially when you consider the amount of time and effort that they obviously put forth to make something of this nature (something not many can lay claim to).
At the same time, time and effort do not equate to quality nor praise when the result is what looks more like a garage play put on by children in capes (with impressive CG).
I went to see this movie with several co-workers when it first came out in 1988.
The manager of the theater was aware of the unintended humor we found in it and when our whole group got up to leave at once, he offered us all free passes to a future movie to entice us to return to his theater.
The rich started taking advantage of the poor since the 16th century, when is agreed that capitalism was born (I would like to know what brilliant economic system ruled before that).
According to the director's view and people interviewed for this documentary, colonialism is responsible for the division between north and south that we see today, and that's when capitalism starts.
The Plank by Eric Sykes is one of my favourite Comedy Shorts so I was very glad when I found that a DVD version was available - that is until I actually bought one with the intention of replacing my ageing copy of The Plank on VHS tape.
For me the highlight is Charlie Drake failing to deliver a cake but it's also fun to see Diana Dors sending herself up - as she used to in later life when she lost her slender shape - in fact I just cannot watch this film without getting a very broad grin on my face.
The situations are effective for smaller children, but when those children are sporting horrible acne, cracking voices, and puberty mustaches it comes off as sad and desperate.
In fact, when it comes down to history, Malcolm in the Middle can be summed up in two ways:  1) As a skit on Family Guy that showcases how annoying the mother is.
2) As more ammo against Frankie Muniz when his career turns into game show appearances or episodes of Cops as the perfect juxtaposition between 'sitcom family life' and 'child predator/drunken mess/druggie/meth addict who gets caught urinating in a gutter and beaten by cops.'
But those times are gone, perhaps forever, and it's hard to see how this show is going to make an impact when nobody remembers it exists until the series finale is used as gum to keep people watching until Family Guy.
I give a show a 3 if I really enjoyed it for the first year or two, but then found it growing stale, stopped planning to watch it, and eventually turned it off when I accidentally ran across it.
There are some scenes of him Campbell Scott, our hero, running to find a train constantly blocking his path across the tracks and of course a "seer" commenting that "another will be along" when he misses a ride on the trolley.
And of course when he does get across the tracks he finds himself in a flophouse with the "po folk" and is rescued by one or the other of the two sisters.
Then he meets Firmin Carter (Jared Harris), a hopeless alcoholic with one up on Lionel, however, inasmuch as he is wealthy, which means that when he hits the floor, at least it's the best that money can buy.
But only when there's something actually worth unraveling.
Renowned adventurer Waldemar is part of the expedition, and the story picks up when he is captured by two demon women.
Waldemar is now infected with the 'curse of the beast', since when did being bitten by a Vampire turn you into a Werewolf?
There is very little gore or violence, a few bites, one brief cannibalism sequence and the most graphic part of the film when someone has the skin on their back sliced off.
(*) I was quite intoxicated when watching this film, so it's possible that I made some of those story lines up myself.
In DIL CHAHTA HAI this is not the case, you're gonna have fun watching Aamir Khan, Saif Ali Khan and Akshaye Khanna when they try to get their beloveds ... and you're gonna laugh!
There are simply times (often many times) when one decides to watch a film merely to enjoy watching a favored actor perform, regardless of the expectations of the film itself.
However, there are also times when one should not make the mistake of confusing the lowering of personal standards in order to enjoy what might not be a very good film, with just plain, out-and-out stupidity.
I went mad with joy when I found that English actor Richard Bremmer was going to be in a movie that was actually going to be shown on American television.
Horror fans, myself included - are generally quite tolerant when it comes to 80's junk, but one thing nobody can stand is a mixture of cheese and boredom.
The building up towards the killings takes far too long (up to seven minutes even) and when the creature finally strikes, we see absolutely nothing and the action promptly swifts to another scene.
There isn't the slightest bit of suspense or any attempt to create an atmosphere; all the potentially interesting sequences are dimly lit and when we finally catch a decent glimpse of the monster it looks like a poor imitation of "Alien".
I don't know when I officially had to turn it off before it put me to me sleep.
UFO effects, when it flees and crushes are bad,too.
The men are, a Bluto-like strongman, a grizzled dynamite expert (who when we first meet him is a suave card shark, but for the rest of the film he looks like a hobo, like they abandoned his original characterization), a Samurai (who is so tan he looks more South American), a young Jim Morrison looking acrobat, and `The Dutchman' Peter Graves.
Now, when Peter Graves is the driving force, the `cool factor' to a film, is there any doubt it will be lackluster?
Some truly horrible moments include Peter Graves faking a Mexican accent, the crew sneaking underneath the train in full view of over half a dozen soldiers, the cross stereotype of the Latino general insulting the Asian samurai, the crew stupidly fearing the trains cannon (which is so huge it couldn't be used at close range, and would only be good if fired at someone directly behind the train and three miles away), and finally, an extended piece at the end when the action is completely halted for an extended 2-3 min sequence of the samurai running across fields like he was on the intro to Little House on the Prairie.
Was the year when first Starship Troopers came out... Man, when I watch it now, it is strong as it was then... Good story, good CGI, good acting... That film was entirely good.
Maybe this review is to harsh, but I am angry when someone tries to make more money on fame of the previous installment.
The bugs have been brutally destroyed in every possible way, i remember the good old days from the first movie, when a bug was so intent on killing its prey that it would try by all means to kill it, focusing solely on it and nothing else.
I remember when i first saw the original starship troopers movie.
They looked more like over-sized toys than weapons, with a barrel that u could fit a tennis ball in, and a stupidly shaped design, it didn't look futuristic, it looked like a toy and i felt sorry for those poor individuals that had to use that misshapen device when they acted in the movie.
But when the Sky Marshal crashes on a apparently deserted planet in the middle of the Arachnid zone matters look grim indeed.
And they get worse when Rico get tried for insubordination and no one seems interested in rescuing the Sky Marshal.
Now I wasn't going into this film expecting something great (like the original starship troopers) and I wasn't expecting something completely garbage (like starship troopers 2); so my feelings were neutral (best when watching a movie for the first time).
Very bad outcome, especially because a lot of people were to watch this to see the conflict between the bugs and the humans when bugs were only present for around 5 to 10 minutes of the film.
However, during the movie when the religion stuff goes over the top(a.k.a.
when pilot and soldier are praying and there is a cheesy fading/overlay effect of explosions and things getting blown up, it just was really tacky).
I still remember that evening when I first borrowed "DIL CHAHATA HAI" CD secretly on the way back from mathematics coaching & very excited to watch it because my sister watched it two days ago & highly praised.
So, without diverting any further with my past numerous hidden movie experiences, when I first watched it, I was simply dazzled by the beauty of the movie.
I was terribly sad when the movie actually ended.
It seems obvious to me that some guys were sitting around (maybe drunk) when they thought of a handful of witty lines and wrote a script around getting them on screen.
On second thought, find it, watch it, and be on the cutting edge when it becomes popular.
On second thought, find it, watch it, and be on the cutting edge when it becomes popular.
It bored me out of my skull when I saw it as a kid.
I first saw this film 5 years ago as a University student when it originally came out.
I am happy that I saw it in one sitting because I believe this had to be a 2 night movie when it first aired.
This latest entry into straight-to-TV videos sees Tom Skerrit running for his life when disaster hits New York City.
I kept wishing I had learned how to darn socks for fun and profit when I was younger, so I might have accomplished something constructive while viewing this moo-vie.
I got the feeling several times in this film, that when the writers reached a crossroads as to where the plot should turn next, they just said, "F*ck it.
It was years ago I read the Henry James novel and I'm not one to criticise a film for not replicating the book,but I do recall the stupendous climax James achieved when Ransomemarched backstage at the Music Hall to literally carry Verena off.
"A British research scientist is working with various forms of bacteria when he is accidentally exposed to a deadly variety due to a lab accident.
I didn't think the monster is very convincing when the film finally unveils it at the end.
Remember back in school when you would get a tedious math assignment like long division or multiplication and instead of actually doing the work you turned to the trusty calculator and just wrote the answer in prompting the teacher to scribble across the top of the paper in red ink "show your work please".
It's really sad when i understand more of the movie from reading the one paragraph DVD sleeve in my Box set, but that seems to be happening more and more with these movies.
on the DVD sleeve it says "A British research scientist is working with various forms of bacteria when he is accidentally exposed to a deadly variety due to a lab accident."
We find that he's mutated into a horrible monster that avoids the light...not so much because he's photosensitive as that the makeup isn't really all that convincing when seen in full light.
But when they open their mouths, you feel like vomiting.
Also on this clip is when Bridget dresses up a black little dog for a costume just then the black dog lays down and does not like that costume.
I suppose some might argue when the old man kicks off these 3 hookers will have nice bank accounts and can move on to a real job.
But money can't buy you self-respect, and I would hate to wonder what these girls see when the mirror stares back at them...
Tamara and Nicolai Zarashoff are (when not pursuing espionage for their government in Moscow) bickering all the time.
One would have known this when reading BACKGROUND TO DANGER a few years later, when they reappeared.
Greenstreet in particular has two nice ones that come to mind: when he notes his favorite set up (a Strauss waltz on a gramophone and a dead body on the floor), and later when his plans have all collapsed, and he is informed he must return to Berlin (his quick look of horror at hearing what will be his death sentence is done very well).
You know how you can tell when someone doesn't know what they're talking about?
The denouement can be when he can't make it to the bathroom in act five, and urinates on himself.
I cant wait for the day when Monk is no longer aired on UK TV.
The point is, there's only so many things you can do with that when you refuse originality.
But things went downhill, or over a cliff, when the writers made the decision to sacrifice all realism in favor of putting their lead character in an OCD sufferer's worst nightmare every week, always thanks to some "Final Destination"-style inescapable twist of fate.
I put up with this insanity for about half of the show's duration, still enjoying the interplay of the actors, but the final straw came in season four, when Mr. Monk went to a rock concert (ho ho, he thinks it involves rocks) and mistook a port-a-john for a phone booth.
The extreme binary of her character makes for hysterical lines when she decides to convert to a cultish Christianity based on the notion of prophesy.
In legit film schools, it will become the best example of how to do EVERYTHING wrong when making a movie.
The day when Bobby Ewing died is a film about the origins of the green movement in Germany in the mid-eighties.
Sorry, maybe i used too much bad words, but i think any modern educated human will feel what i felt when they watched this movie.
Dil Chahta Hai was an amazing movie for me when I first saw it...and it's still one of my favorites.
I have much movies in this genre (shockumentary) but i tend to like them best when they stay without any political views.
In my opinion, The Germs,(as a band), died when Darby died.
I had the album "The Decline Of Western Civilization" when it came out back then and I thought the Germs portion of the record was cool, but I was more of a Circle Jerks, Black Flag kind of guy.
But Shane West always had this cocky smirk on his face even when he was trying to look sad.
Like when they were shooting up, they were in a conveniently lit spot just for them.
So i'm not biased when it comes to them and am not a fan.
It's not giving too much away to say that the cause of the human's strange behaviour is in fact an airborne virus which infects people, then leaves the host for another when that person dies.
So, when i saw the trailer 'John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars' on TV, i was so excited to see the film.
I freely admit I feel a touch of anger when reflecting upon "Ghosts of Mars."
The only scene where there was any slight amount of suspense was when we see the door off to the side slowly opening up, but that just lead to another cheap shocker instead of building up on it.
Its hard to pinpoint exactly when it happened, perhaps as early as The Prince of Darkness, which was creepy but deeply flawed, or They Live, certainly by the time he made the regrettable Memoirs of an Invisible Man.
I almost s**t a brick when I saw them.
It's explained as something the ghosts used to do when they were alive....*sigh*....  Oh well, they have this leader guy and he looks like a devil or something, in the gothiest outfit I've ever seen in a sci-fi.
The funniest part is when this guy issues commands or preaches to his flock.
I almost swallowed my icecream scoop when I first heard him, then I just laughed myself into a coma.
i am 13 and i watched Zenon: Girl of the 21st Century when i was like 9 and I still successfully HATED it.
just whirl in their coffins when somebody tries to judge about the Russian cinema thinking of the "72 meters".
Terrible soundtrack...when it's there.
If you're reading this thinking, "Oh so when the humans in the movie die, it's alright, huh?
The man is too much of a pansy to even point the camera at the screen when someone gets shot in the head.
The plot is confusing and lacklustre; the flashbacks are badly handled and when you get to the end of the movie you feel like saying 'so what?'
Maybe an idea for the crew behind Spiderman or X-men when they run out of sequel ideas.
These things look like costumes my mother made for my brother and me when we were twelve and eight and wanted to be DC superheroes (Technically, he was a villain, but Slade Wilson was always such a cool character, you know?).
Leaving alone the fact that this woman looks exactly the same in and out of costume in front of the Martin guy, there's just the fact that when she's rejecting him, she's still wearing his earrings.
I know that David Ogden Stiers is a good actor, and I don't mean to be a purist or anything, but when I think about words to describe the Martian Manhunter, obese doesn't come to mind.
Why is the main character so keen on walking around in the corn fields, when each time he does so he gets caught by bear traps?
Why doesn't the old couple react at all when the guy brings out their music box to the garden and starts playing loud music in the middle of the night?
It would be more bearable if Mamoulian, like other directors who rely on exaggerated technique such as Michael Curtiz, FW Murnau and Alfred Hitchcock, at least knew some basic cinematic grammar, but he is a novice when it comes to screen storytelling.
She was at her most sensitive and emotive when singing, as her performance in the 1936 version of Showboat demonstrates, but she is underused as a singer in Applause.
For an example when the man was glueing the feathers to the chicken's head it sounded like he was walking through a swamp every time he dabbed is brush!
I saw this when it first came out and didn't know quite what to make of it.
My GOD, she looks sexy, even when she is  sweeping a porch!!!
Most of what Charlie does isn't all that scary (such as having someone turn into an iguana--and not even showing the transformation), though I really loved when he was royally ticked off and overheard people laughing--and made their faces disappear (you see one of these people--a woman grasping about the ship).
It is also an absurd time so show a villainous Pakistan when Indo-Pak diplomatic ties are underway.
And would Mr. Allan Amin tell me when will his obsession with slow-motion end?
Peter tried obviously hard, actors are as usual all great, so is the cinematography, but when hardly anyone laughs at the Berlin premiere, which I attended, then you have a major problem at hands.
***** spoiler********   when the launch sank, and i saw it coming, my jaw just dropped, as well as my spirits, it was beyond ludicrous   ***** end of spoiler********  If ever you want to see a true hijacking of a movie by an actor watch Vincent Price in His Kind of Woman.
***** spoiler ********  The scene where the mob are trying to inject Mitchum with brain-wiping drugs, when he is moments away from rescue is hilarious in a truly post-ironic manner.
Randolph Scott is a former Confederate soldier and Joan Bennett plays a woman who refuses to admit when the Civil War is over in James Hogan's cattle rustling epic, which looks and feels in retrospect a lot like a B version of Howard Hawks' "Red River."
For instance, when the uber-annoying regional bureaucrat (Robert Barrat) is murdered rather obviously in the midst of a fray by Scott's trapping buddy (Hatton), the military officer in charge (Harvey Stephens) barely bothers to investigate and suddenly switches plans and agrees to help the ranchers.
In that story, a fictional war hero clearly based on Theodore Roosevelt impersonates his friend O'Roon (a mounted police officer assigned to Central Park) when O'Roon is unable to fulfil his duties: the brief story ends with one of O. Henry's trademark coincidences.
Usually, when an important stage performer makes a rare screen appearance, I commend the film for preserving the performer's act.
Even when watching a DVD borrowed from the library I place a value on my time.
But when the thieves climb over the beams with a fancy telescoping ladder rig we can clearly see the laser beams sagging!
sound when those air hoses were disconnected?
But at least in "The Italian Job" when things blow up they go BOOM!, and in "Ocean's Twelve" the laser beams don't sag.
At best, "Grand Slam" will barely pass as a rental when the other choices are few, which is too bad because it showed many traces of potential, but never capitalized on any of them.
This movie is not really a Christmas movie, it's more like a dark nasty movie that makes it more like a Halloween movie like the attic and cave parts and stuff Even when I was 9 year old little girl I didn't like this.
As the increasingly sluggish movie drones on, Roth gets more involved with the bar punk but then tries to pull back when he grows so rough and possessive that it becomes abusive.
Roth's old boyfriend is arrested when a knife turns up in his car, but he claims he had nothing to do with the killings.
A character gratuitously gives Roth the address of that person's apartment, which leads to a key plot point, when there is no way in the world the person would have wanted Roth to drop by.
For some reason, the movie comes up with nothing but drab sweat-suits for Roth to wear in most scenes (including when she hosts the accountant for dinner).
If your stomach would feel bad when you see a bad movie, do not watch it.
today when i woke up and found out he's still alive and in office, i had the shock of my life :-)   but honestly, this film was well meant and everything, but as always you get pointed in the wrong direction.
Why the harebrained duo, Range and Finch, picked this subject is obvious when you scan the hair-triggered rags and the inflamed threads on this board.
It earned the slothenly four during a long slip from a decent five when it failed to convince me that its creation was justified.
There are tons of "come of age" movies and this is a wonderful one, it's like a fresh air enters into a stuffy room when I was watching it.
The rest of the film is just a sob story about how the poor Muslims are always getting blamed when anything bad happens to America.
However this will remain to others, who have seen more than this movie and have a different understanding of this world in which we live in, an intellectual 'wheelchair' to the Liberal base that doesn't indeed look for the good in America but continues to find a 'Villain' in the U.S.   My question is, before 9/11, when there were still three thousand people in one piece, and Bin Laden was offered to President Clinton, on two different occasions, when William passed on taking him, because he said, "We have no business, with Bin Laden."
what do you call having guilt when some one commits a crime against you?
The movie is not a commentary on US or world politics but a tired re-telling of the problems with what happens when the justice system investigates with blinkers.
We got to the end of the film just to see what this turd could possibly bring to anyone, and were very disturbed about all the fake tears made out to be documented, what's the point of getting actors telling you their fake stories when you have real people who have the same exact story (taking away the assassination of Bush of course) but have authentic sorrow, not crocodile tears!
just when I thought that the U.S. couldn't get more confusing in their actions, someone decides to make a "mockumentary" further confusing people unaware of what is really going on in the U.S. and easily influenced people.
Even when it mentioned Chaney moving up to presidency I perked up for a moment, as if the opening credits ended and the movie were about to begin, but no, no, back to some fictional trial with a bunch of malarkey about evidence.
God knows what they thought they were doing when they agreed to appear in this turkey.
It's got to be a warning when the big marquee names are ex reality TV contestants and comedians who wonder what happened to their once-thriving careers.
Then comes the twist when Sid falls in love with older woman Tara Jaiswal (Dimple Kapadia), an interior designer, who is a divorcee.
He is too good in the comic scenes and is excellent in the emotional scenes also -- especially in the scene when he breaks down on the phone while talking to his father.
In fact, I'm wondering if the film makers were drunk when they wrote this, shot it, edited it.
(Leprechauns in Space or Children of the Corn in the ghetto are two abominable examples but I have to give the Halloween people credit when their main killer Michael Myers went off to do Wayne's World)  However at least these franchises made the appearance of some effort.
The true genius of Sherlock Holme's stories is watching Holmes take a number of small clues that lead to implausible deductions which when afterward explained by Holmes seem completely and utterly reasonable.
Although I appreciate the spirit behind WAR, INC., it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort, especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique, rather than simply the poor writing, direction, and production of this particular film.
The bottom line: hyperbole isn't required when it comes to lampooning US/Neo-Conservative politics...it's already a big enough joke.
This movie was released in the year 2001, the time when bollywood seemed to be in doldrums, producing one trash after another, the same year when another masterpiece "Lagaan" was released from bollywood and the year I finished my college and entered my first job and wow what an experience - it was just like a fresh breath of air.
He plays a character who falls for every other girl, but is unable to express it when he really starts loving the one.
But, when I saw Dan Aykroyd's character, in the beginning of the show, sitting on a toilet taking a dump, I knew the rest of the show would go to the tank as well.
When you feel that it is a movie that you are watching and not a story that you could immerse yourself in, when you see sweating actors instead of characters or cheap sets instead of real locations you know that the illusion you expect to get from a film will not arrive this time.
Okay, I'm not good at telling people apart at best, and when they're all young men, about the same ages, general build, and height and all wearing very similar suits, my ability at identifying them goes waaaaay down.
Beautiful car - as this film was set in the late 1950's, back when cars were cars, if you know what I mean.
Then when Florence finally shows up out at the fort where Leon is, Leon, who has already been blubbering, which seemed completely out of character for him, does still more bawling around, and Florence sort of comforts him in a rough kind of way.
Harry Guardino's county sheriff brings in his boys when things get tricky but to no any real effect except the last scene.
The running joke of the gung-ho county police's incompetence is taken too far when it causes a death.
It can be crude and offensive, as when Marsh jokes to Ross' question about why he is still single, "I'm a faggot.
"; a deputy laughs hysterically when discussing with Marsh a young woman who had part of her anatomy bitten off by a guy with her in the back seat of a car that hit a bump in the road; Marsh mutters in response to Lawford's new teenage-looking floosie girlfriend's question about whether there are motels in town with vibrator beds "in the box," "In the box, neat....City folks.
Unfortunately for Chao Wei; her performance came last when you already lost interest.
I really dislike when advertisers pull people into a film under false pretenses.
The first thing that i realized is that at least for me the show was based on agent Mulder and his special non-romantic relationship with Sculley, the last 2 seasons totally ruin that, Mulder mostly isn't there and when he is the he deals with the romances with Sculley and their baby.
Dishonored is the third of three films that the director/player team of Josef Von Sternberg and Marlene Dietrich and the second for Paramount when they were imported from Weimar Germany.
I believe the title grab of Kickboxer 5 was more a money grab to receive more profits, when without the references to the Sloane family and the Kickboxer name as well as a bit more drama/character development this film could have easily Stood Alone and Made the same money without the kickboxer name.
OK, what were the filmmakers smoking when they made this?
And when men seek such perfection, they find only death...fire...loss...disillusionment; the end of everything thats gone forward.
For whatever reason, Columbia Pictures (who picked up the movie for distribution in Britain & America) then had a voice actor re-dub Lee's voice back into English all over again when they finally got around to releasing it in the new world in 1979.
The scene when an old Rohit returns home to find Nisha dead will bring tears to your eyes and you wonder what the point is for the tragic fate of these two.
I remember seeing this when it first aired.
Underneath the extraordinarily hilarious comments, I saw a movie that seemed halfway decent, when compared to such other MST3K victims as Manos: The Hands of Fate.
I'll stop here in case you are waiting to watch this movie, but the best part is when Trumpy does magic things which the guys rip to shreds.
The "pod people" or pod person, since there is only one, besides Trumpy, the lovable (not really) pod kid, goes around looking for its child (Trumpy) but you can only see its legs for most of the movie and when you do see it in its entirety, you see that it is very short and lame, almost looks like Alf.
I'm usually not so passionate when rating movies, especially family films, but please don't mind me when I say that *BLEEP* all those filmmakers who shoved this atrocity up my face.
The entire movie tries to make you laugh with the mere notion that all these ridiculous acts of violence are meticulously planned out and perpetrated by some sadistic, spoiled 10-year-old yuppie accidentally left behind by his family when on vacation in NYC.
Obvious inconsistencies and illogicalities aside (such as the "10-year-old pro carpenter"), I was infuriated by the fact that the Home Alone series tries to pass itself as 'family film', when what it shows is blatant violence in the name of cuteness.
Everything looks SO ugly in it, and when it's not ugly, it's foggy.
I may be way off base on this, but when the McAllisters' car pulls into that Miami Seafood Restaurant parking lot in the pouring rain, there appears to be one single vehicle there.
I recommend saving it for times when you feel bad about yourself and your career and prospects.
It was also the very first episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 I ever saw, way back when, so it will always have a special place in my heart.
Eventually all these tales converge when Trumpy, a lovable fuzzy alien with an odd shaped head and phallic snout, hatches out of one the aforementioned strange eggs.
Trumpy is cool, especially when he does "magic things" like stand on the ceiling, make Tommy's laundry fly through the air, and turn an old Simon game into a slammin' beat box (Mix Master Trumpy's jams would later be pilfered by Moby, The Beastie Boys, and others).
All their limbs are sure to be broken now especially when the movie is showing this in slow motion!
The so called script is heavily based on the idea that it's impossible to run from ants so when the ants (the black dots with legs) attacks, the characters just stands in a corner and screams until they are eaten.
Oh and one of the most annoying things is that when you watch this movie on a channel that doesn't have as many commercialblocks as the American TV stations (one every 10 minutes)you'll get the fade-to-black and then fade-from-black every 10 minutes, which is just put in there for the commercials breaks.
You know a movie is bad,I mean really,really bad when your 11 yr old tells you that they want it on DVD - because its the funniest film they have ever seen.
What was Mitch 'X-files' Pileggi thinking when he took a role in this Turkey?
This, plus excellent (and when I say excellent, I mean awful) special effects, acting, and death scenes make Killer Ants!
a great movie for a Friday night at 2 AM when you've had one too many drinks and you're ready to make fun of anything that isn't yourself.
And when a guy jumped off a barn, he said "Ahh!
It's the ultimate anti-climax when you realise the thing terrorising the good folk of Burlie Pines is a plague of marauding soldier ants!!
Hey, did anyone notice that when they heard the cut off thing explode, they said we cant get out of here now.
when they were in the middle of the two dams, they pulled over to the side of the road before stopping, why would you do that when your the only ones left?
And just when they were about to stop on the side, you can see one of the stage crew's arms in shot.
He tells the car when to stop.
Especially when the dam is blown.
and who noticed the massive case of 'cameltoe-itis' that the teacher lady had when asking for the gun?
the CGI for blowing up the dam is cutting edge, not to mention when the helicopter goes kaboom while traveling at granny walking pace.
Our "hero" seems to forget this when they are on the bank of a river being attacked by ants.
So the movie starts out with a honeymooning couple giggling in the woods when they come upon a giant, muddy hill.
Suddenly the wife is being pulled into the hill (after she was clearly tired of being photographed, no less), and when the husband tries to come up to save her, he gets dragged under too.
Just how big are they supposed to be because the rubber ones used to stick on someone when they are being attack is about twice the size of the CGI designs!
The Indian guy is also Grey Wolf or Red Wolf depending on when they are talking to him.
Three people sank into that ant hill, and last time I saw an ant hill, the ants at least come out; especially when they are eating full-sized humans.
As a big fan of Kathy Lette's early novels, I was so pleased when I heard they were making this into a film.
Interesting point to watch for me was the investigating detective whose speech impediment vanishes when he reappears in the film.
It started horribly when you realised the central character was going to be using a fake Australian accent throughout the film.
The filmmakers are trying to generate so much sympathy for Roth that none is generated at all because of the film; only when the audience member sits down and thinks, "Well, wasn't she a victim of show business (and life in general)."
The movie just doesn't know when to stop.
Well when they are in present time, there was soo much lying going on (when Andy Lau and Jacky CHeung went for the interview is just one of many example).
I thought the movie sounded good when I heard it had something to do with vampires and such.
Expecially when there is so much more better things out there.
It used to pain me, as a kid, to watch this show when it was on and usually I'd have to change the channel halfway through.
that is not the worst part of the sequel the worst part is th really annoying slow motion glitch you get when you go around corners or put the foot down when you pull away from a standing position.
The Brain Eaters starts with the newly engaged Glenn Cameron (Alan Frost) driving his lucky fiancÃ© Elaine (Jody Fair) to the small American town of Riverdale in Illinois to break the good news when they see a sudden bright flash.
The mystery deepens even further when an expert in bio-chemistry , Professor Helsingman (Saul Bronson), who has been missing for the past five years turns up out of the blue.
The Brain Eaters themselves are rarely seen & when they are they look like wigs with antenna's.
Mr. Redcoat whacks Tom, and when he wakes up he's in a car with Redcoat and some other strange men.
Meanwhile, Mr. Carson has married another womanÂ   Even for the time, the comedy dialog in "John Loves Mary" must have sounded remarkably unsophisticated; listen, for example, to the scene when Reagan explains how he dealt with "loneliness" during his four years of service.
(They seemed to be much better at playing the pet roles than they were when playing the non pet portion of their characters.)
Instead, when I wasn't laughing, I was just stunned by how bad it was.
Even so, its raison dâetre is Ganceâs use of the wide-angle lens in depicting the disorientating effect on people when subjected to a drug (in the form of dust particles) concocted by the protagonist.
One thing definitely is that "Predator" is a definite masterpiece when compared to this cheap, hokey and pitifully vapid effort.
There goes another one of my brain cells" when watching this one-of-a-kind piece of trash.
It's pretty mind numbing to listen to, especially when it goes for meaningful conversations.
There are some quite nasty moments when the rubbery alien decides it's torture time with some blood squirting.
Im sorry but british comedy is only funny when its *British*.
This is a real curiosity from the vaults, a late 60s Swedish sex education film which became an enormous box office hit across Europe and even, when it was finally released uncut with an X certificate, in the UK in 1973 (it was initially refused a certificate); this is historically interesting, as The Language of Love (as it was titled in English speaking markets) features some sections of actual hardcore footage, with close ups of fingers masturbating vaginas and a penis penetrating one.
The most striking moment comes when the most focused-upon couple, who've previously experienced sexual problems, talk to each other after a bout of now satisfying sex and tell each other that they are now "real" - two less "real" people you'll have trouble finding in the history of the cinema.
Home Alone took everyone by surprise when it became the top money-earner of 1990.
In fact when I first saw it, I thought if it had been made by John Hughes, it could have been a much better film.
There are times when Home Alone 2 thinks its being really clever, by dropping in knowing references to the first film, in a vain attempt to make you think this is not a rehash.
and when the "Chinese navy" fired, the battleship officers were speaking cantonese too... and Chinese army had absolutely no such fire power in the 1950s.
, so when you have a movie about the Duke escorting a bunch of refugees downriver from Red China you know what to expect ie all Chinese who aren`t commies are brave and noble and could easily pass as WASPish Americans while all communist Chinese are drunk , stupid and rape anything that moves .
Her character is completely undeveloped and rather wooden (except when she inexplicably wants to drop everything and get herself killed for absolutely no reason late in the film).
With the help of his apparently retarded brother Michael J. Pollard, Garfield has been leading a double life murdering hookers for Satan when he isn't giving his pretty boy students a hard time for being late to class.
Even Elliot Gould as the burnt out washed up cop who used to be Billy's dad's partner back when he was on the force.
It's just like belonging to the Rotary Club or something, and the weird part is that nobody seems to care even when it should be pretty obvious that the guy has some major judgment issues as he plays bizarre, legally problematic head games with his students.
There are some very clumsy moments, such as when our visionary shows a pal a symbol that has been perhaps tormenting him - difficult to tell with Karyo's complete lack of facial expression - which is of course a swastika.
You know yer in for it when the main character ( the priest), which whom we are supposed to empathize with, not only collects trivial horror film memorabilia, but also porn mags and frequents strip clubs.
I still remember the trailer they used to promote this movie in Europe (it's a different trailer than the one here on the IMDb, which is a weak trailer, too) and it was in fact a TERRIFIC trailer, just great, with the soldiers being introduced in scenes I never saw in the movie (you never see the soldiers sparkling in Nolte's glasses in the movie either...), so I remember having felt let down when I saw it first (nearly 20 years ago), but recently I wondered if it's time for a new viewing, when it was aired on TV here a few days ago: well, as said above my memory was unfortunately right and it still has not improved with time (never will).
Whether or not this is the case is uncertain, but when Tone's newspaper friend is killed when he tries investigating (again, it was made to look like a suicide), he knows that there is some sort of conspiracy afoot.
Payton married him when he recovered and then left him seven weeks later for Neal.)
I must have blinked when the last two were on and I'm not about to watch Jigsaw again just to verify them.
A moment she says when the helicopter fly's by that they don't control the River that's why they can't be seen!!!
Specially when some escaped prisoners are around there.
because it won't work for a good while when it is in the water, second of all where in the name of god did they get the guns?
The fairground scene equally predictable and nauseating as we see the "romantic interest" blossom, while bad kids steal fireworks, and you just know "sumthin' bad is gonna happen" There's even a "bridge crossing" reminiscent of SBM, at which point "bad earring boy" falls into lake, is naturally saved by boy, just before they all go over the waterfall that wasn't there 2 minutes ago, and the dog has disappeared only to make the customary reappearance at the end of the film when everything turns out happily ever after, the good and bad all become friends, and while playing chess (the way new best buddies always do), along comes baddies daddy, with a peace offering, and a hearty welcome and along comes doggie to be greeted with absolutely no emotion by kid, and they all lived happily ever after.
Buzz faked it but when Kevin explained, they didn't buy it.
So when trying to enter through the front, Marv has a run-in with a staple gun.
The film is laid out like a comic strip, however, this wanes quickly when there is no need for it when it starts to become over used.
He is pursued by Monkees-type pop star (invented by publicists) Tommy Steele (age 32) as a leprechaun who is turning mortal because that's what happens when your 3-wish-granting gold is stolen.
He professed to be amazed when he learned that Arthur Sullivan composed music that went along with that crazy stuff.
He was better when he was even older, like in Ghost Story.
We're supposed sympathize because their minty cancer leaves won't burn and rejoice at the end when they inexplicably burst into smoky flame.
Amazingly, the director and cameraman did not even pull the cameras back far enough to see Astaire's feet when he was dancing!
I cannot believe that when I was a kid I thought him the bees knees!!
I think I'd have loved this film when I was 9 or 10 but now I can only watch it in disbelief while I shake my head and mutter "Oh, come on!"
That resolve was maintained by sidekick Tobias (Chill Wills), shown to be correct when the Comanches force their own hand by shooting their bargaining chip Foster (Jess Barker).
Interesting how one can see more clearly when when one's life is on the line.
It gets a little embarrassing though to see how much confidence he places in his own Kentucky Rifle, especially when he offers up a prayer to help him shoot straight.
I like the part when Mr. Duncan gives Kevin McCallister the turtle doves then gives it to a friend to be friends forever.
Watch this Christmas movie soon when you buy or have it for a present for Christmas then people all around the world for Christmas will love this Christmas movie.
Just when I was about to almost leave the theatre, the movie gets a dramatic turn by Cruz' character having cancer.
I need to add that I first saw this in Madrid when it opened in Spain.
Why does she act like she wants something meaningful from him when he clearly is willing to give her a nice sexy superficial relationship with all the trimmings of a celebrity academic's lifestyle?
They must have all stayed at home when they realized how touching it would be for her to wake up from a mastectomy to find no one there to console her but a disgusting ex-boyfriend.
I think the only look of happiness on his face was a stupid, s**t-eating grin, when he inexplicably shows up at a dance club to observe her.
Where are William Holden and Kay Lenz when we need them?
when the family arrives at the airport, Kevin gets separated, and ends up going to new york...all alone, on his own personal vacation, which is what he wished for, but that wish soon turns into a nightmare when he has to deal with a nosy doorman, a crazy bird-loving lady, and the returning antagonists, Marv and harry, who broke out of prison.
What was Blake Edwards when he casted him?
Ted Wass is bland and ineffectual; when I watch him here I keep thinking of how much better this movie could have been if most of his scenes were acted or directed differently.
One of the few times he made me laugh was when he was doing the voice for his "instant companion."
I remember I actually liked "Curse of the Pink Panther" when I was a kid.
If all else, U.S. Navy Sailors, like myself who wear the cloth of the nation, when viewing a portrayal of our duties, deserve to see them portrayed correctly.
As previously stated, I'm an eternal optimist when it comes to movies; I fervently believe that they HAVE to get better.
What's worse is that money forced this "final installment" to be evidence that horror is the most untrustworthy genre when it comes to pleasing the viewer.
By now, it is useless to comment on the fact that Paramount lied when they said it was the last.
This movie is awful, I saw it when I was kid and it did not scare me at all, in fact it bored me.
Limbs fall off for no reason and when they cut someones head off, they hug it, which is not as dumb as it is disturbing.
While I appreciated the mortality rate of the characters in X (as opposed to the cliches of being beaten down to a pulp but then coming back and winning) it was just like watching meat through a grinder - I didn't care when they went in and didn't care when they came out.
The whole film is just about one event that is supposed to happen, when it does, its crap and lasts about 10 seconds.
This time the fight is not about a pizza, but because Buzz humiliates Kevin in public when it's his solo singing of the song "My Christmas Tree", making many laugh.
Besides, Buzz isn't even being sincere when he apologizes.
One of my favorite parts is when Kevin fools the Corcierge with that cool song "Cool Jerk" - that is hysterical!
And what to say about when Kevin fools and scares the hell out of all those hotel's professionals with a gangster's movie named "Angels with Even Filthier Souls"?
The most hysterical part is when Kevin is about to throw a 4th brick and Marv is trying to warn Harry with a strange and almost cartoonish tone of voice, so much that it's impossible to understand what is he saying.
It is huge and full of everything when it comes to Christmas decorations.
After seeing this movie back when it was released, I remember being utterly disappointed by it.
In truth, he doesn't fail to return on that promise, but the lines do not come off with the same charm that the first movies held; indeed, how could they when the lines themselves are delivered with two-by-four accuracy?
Unfortunately, when reading other reviews, one finds that many have bought into this "saga", and have been suckered into this TERRIBLE excuse for a film from a much older George Lucas.
As I would expect any adult would, when an annoying eight year old kid is the center of the story, doing ridiculous things ("Gee, I don't know how I just blew up this space station and saved the world, but I better get outta here!").
I remember when this film came out, I kept putting off seeing it.
I was still waiting for the story to get started when the final battle began.
"Was I any different when you taught me?"
This movie is a perfect example of when what could have been one of the most brilliant movies ever is made, through the incompetence of only one man, into one of the worst.
He has gone from the great actors' director he was when he made American Graffiti to a special effects artist gone wildly out of control.
There are a thousand instances of questionable logic in this movie like, why did Queen Amidala reveal herself when she did?
Why do we not see them in the later episodes, when they seem to be of immeasurable tactical value?
There's a body or two buried in the garden, the internment of one of these was witnessed by a criminal on the run, but he says nothing when caught by the police.
The print is relatively nice looking, but there are a couple of moments, when the screen goes black for a second, where the original 35mm print is clearly damaged or faulty.
To top the already boring & too much hyped characterization, however dense, don't be surprised when the gay character tearfully reveals that he's been in love with the unhappily married guy for the longest time.
I really didn't care about the other characters at all, and oddly enough the only other white character was a Pinoy stereotype of American women (it's hard to take a film like this seriously when they can't even overcome the things they claim to find offensive in U.S. films).
I am not sure when the era of "respectable" medium budget horror started (right after CREEPSHOW 2, maybe) but it resulted in a decades worth of uninteresting no-scares and no-offense meant horror efforts.
RUNESTONE created nothing new, accomplished nothing notable and is probably only remembered by the scattershot few who bothered renting it as a home video release and perhaps yearn for the good old days when you could go out & rent three movies for $5.00 on a weeknight, watch them safe and secure knowing that your life with not be changed by any of them, there will be three more just like it to check out the following night, there will be no reason to ever watch any of them ever again, and your girlfriend won't be put off by gratuitous exploitational nudity or gross icky gore.
In fact, when I come to think what director in film history blew more literary classics, the name of George Cukor immediately comes to mind.
Oh, yeah, my favorite part is Macaulay (Kevin McAllister) was walking around in New York when he was lost then later, he went to the toy store to buy something then these 2 bad guys found him then Macaulay (Kevin) was screaming same thing then run away from these 2 bad guys in the city of NY but it was so funny because I loved Macaulay's screaming that make me laugh so hard!
Absolutely nothing happens throughout this film up until like the last 15 minutes when it FINALLY becomes watchable.
Many films include at least one actor guilty of this heinous sin, but when they almost all do so the fault probably lies squarely with the Director.
This is conventionally explained by the absence of dialogue forcing a greater emphasis on gesture, but John Barrymore even in some of his most unrestrained roles seldom continued exaggerated gesturing beyond the point when it was needed; and this need was often due more to difficulty in creating effective close ups than to the absence of sound, problems that co-existed in those early days.
How can our hero run so fast when he smokes so much?)
Cuba Gooding Jr. played a lawyer who was disbarred when he decided he really didn't want to defend someone he knew was guilty.
Then this old guy comes into his life, and the old guy's kind of interesting, but I immediately detected something was fishy when he said his name was Christopher Marlowe.
However, the old man mysteriously dies before he can return the book to him, and that's when he does something completely unexpected and decides to publish it as his own.
Another example was when Gooding picked up the automatic that the murderer had used to kill Beringer.
But when a lone detective tells him about the dilapidated dude's death and calls himself Goethe, maybe a red flag should have gone up.
He's a fine comic actor but his little smirks, quizzical looks and mugging to the camera just don't work when he's playing the dramatic lead.
He's so sure he has everything figured out when in fact he doesn't know jack.
"No, I didn't wet the bed when I was a child."
What were they thinking when they were making this movie?
What I mean is the same pretension that she seems to be commenting on (although too little too late by the last shot when she calls for the camera to move in front of her directly in profile), and done with a very 'this is how it is' take on things.
Only when Chaplin comes out- also again Rossellini herself playing her along with David O Selznik- does some praise come out.
It sounds really good on the outset, but it's not what I thought it would be when I finally saw it- a mess.
My favorite scenes include stock footage of a plane taking off (when in fact the plane should be landing), using a caged bird as a projectile, throwing a woman by her breast, and don't even get me started on the ending... Just amazingly awful.
Who can possibly fail to laugh at Marv getting the shock of his life when he tries to turn on the taps?
-------------------END SPOILERS--------------------   None of this came off as believable to me; I was constantly pulled out of the movie because it only made sense in the context of del toro trying to move the plot along when the events constituting it just wouldn't fit.
Princess Nuala seems to be always against the war but in the end when Prince Nuada stakes his claim to the Golden Army as the unchallenged heir she is silent as if it was to give an opportunity for the CGI team to show off with a fight sequence!
It really left us feeling empty when we left the cinema and I definitely would not want to see Hellboy 3 anymore should that ever come out.
When i went to see the original Hellboy i did not have very high expectations and was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be extremely enjoyable, i was therefore looking forward to a similarly enjoyable experience when viewing this film.
On a side note, not being aware that Seth Macfarlane had voiced the character when i first viewed the film i spent half the time wondering why Krauss sounded exactly like Klaus the fish in American Dad.
Did anyone laugh when hell boy is beat up by the mist guy with lockers?
Kevin and his family are heading down to Florida for Christmas this year, but when Kevin gets mixed up at the air port and gets on the wrong flight, he ends up in New York.
My favorite scene is without a doubt when Marv gets hit in the face with the bricks, also, the scene where the Plaza Hotel managers are asked by Kevin's mom "What kind of idiots do you have working here?!"...
You know you're in trouble when the opening scene reveals that the narrator of the film is going to be a corpse.
A green mask keeps appearing in a window for no discernible reason until a weak explanation comes late in the story involving a blindfold and a man's vengeance when betrayed by his wife.
Midwest married couple, George and Gwen Kellerman, chronicle their Big Apple nightmares when George races to make a job interview, and everything seems to go as wrong as possible.
Hawn only has one notable seen in the remake (as wife 'Gwen'), when she throws her scene of furor at the police station.
Of course, when Bela Lugosi is on camera the movie becomes interesting.
Bela Lugosi gives a great performance as always, I am not sure if even that is capable of redeeming this movie -- especially when the nagging thought kept running through my head that surely someone could have found something better for this great actor to do than this drek.
There is a single set, the various characters' entrances and exits give the film an extremely stagy feeling and when they talk, they usually utter lines of heavily portentous dialogue.
After that set-up during the first 20 minutes or so, the film seems to forget all about Laura until the very end of the film, when some absurd, out-of-left field explanation is given about how she was literally "scared to death" by someone from her past who has returned to settle an old score.
I especially liked when Zucco declares that the zombie-like lady is being controlled through mental telepathy!
The biggest mystery of the film is why it was filmed in color in the first place - when there were so many lesser musicals that could have been enhanced by color.
Love the part when George Zucco listens to the heartbeat of a woman who fainted and immediately declares she's under hypnosis!
Carrillo takes a liking to Doug when he catches him with Dodd and Fairbanks shows some coolness under fire.
It's nice to see him again, but his performance is rather unnoticeable, and you get the idea that he's only any good when he can deliver witty one-liners.
This reveals the essence of his character: the ability to make coldly dispassionate decisions even when his personal safety is at stake.
I read the book on which this film is based--"Bud and Lou", by Bob Thomas--when it first came out, and it didn't impress me much.
In addition, and even more damaging, is the fact that Korman and Hackett have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever, which is painfully obvious by their atrocious rendering of "Who's On First"; it's so embarrassingly, maddeningly inept--Hackett, for reasons known only to himself, speaks even more slowly here than he does in the rest of the movie, when the whole POINT of the routine was Costello getting more and more overwhelmed as the pace got faster and faster--that it should have been completely cut out.
I was elated when I won two tickets to the closing night film at The Melbourne International Film Festival.
If not, why not Â I hate the convention and I hate how it makes people that do it feel clever because it 'breaks the fourth wall' and that's so 'out there' when it comes to mainstream cinema.
I felt dirty when I watched Suburban Mayhem.
I was only a 12 year old kid when I initially saw this movie on the first day of my summer vacation from school back in 1970.
Why do people laugh in this show when someone walks in the door?
Don't get me wrong I love my wife, BUT - kinda jokes, lets make jokes behind the wife then act like a child when shes around.
It was on the television when I visited someone in the hospital.
I hoped for another thing of this film, but not covered all my expectation, sorry that she is Mexican, but is necessary to recognize when she is good or bad, and this is garbage, literally.
I hoped for another thing of this film, but not covered all my expectation, sorry that she is Mexican, but is necessary to recognize when she is good or bad, and this is garbage, literally.
when you base characters on prince songs you have a problem.
when you throw those characters into a plot that goes nowhere, and you end up with something that is a train-wreck of Uwe Boll proportions.
the direction, hr mm it feels like the director just REALLY wanted to get to check out a couple of chicks stripping then making out, and somehow even that looks repulsive in this movie I'm sure some high schooler somewhere is having a fit or questioning my sexuality, but REALLY I am serious when I say that this entire movie would have been better as two minutes of music video when the end comes, and I have to note this doesn't happen soon enough by any definition, you're left with absolutely nothing but the fact that you'd just wasted your time and most likely your money hell like the other guy I bought it in a bargain pack, and STILL felt ripped-off.
The plots all involved him trying to trick people into giving him money or trying to trick women into sleeping with him or usually both of those things, all he did was con people and it always backfired because he was very bad at it and thought he was a lot smarter than everyone else when he wasn't.
Needless to say, Yuva looked trashy when pitted against an impressive Hollywood original.
And why on earth is it set in Bengal when none of the characters except Prosenjit Banerjee looks or sounds like a Bengali?
on top of that when season two got ready to start i didn't see any promos for it.
oh well they moved the show around and rating when down.
She tries to maintain a public image of the perfect wife and mother when in reality, her life is chaotic (and not funny).I thought I should give it a chance and maybe I just caught the show at a bad episode but I was wrong they are just plain fully uninteresting.
The acting is actually quite good although it's sometimes hard to judge the acting when the dialogue is this bad.
It all starts when NYC is fogged in and they have to fly to Boston.
Like her other movie "La ciÃ©naga", Lucrecia Martel continues without saying anything to me clearly, when I was trying to understand this movie, it ended!!!
What i really thought was annoying, was the lack of ending, it suddenly stops when the 2 girls are swimming...uh.
Don't go see this movie, when you don't speak Spanish.
The amateurish framing recalled my son, when he was a baby boy and had some trouble to use the camcorder, cutting heads, shoulders, legs of feet in his footages; the same happens along the whole movie.
The biggest problem with having pretty Maria Alche' in the lead role is that she looks much older than the script indicates (she was 21 when the film was released) and is obviously not an innocent.
It diminishes the sense of immorality(and probable illegality) surrounding the sexual advance made upon her by the physician when that sense is central to the premise and the concluding events.
Oh, I almost forgot, I will give Martel this: speaking from the somewhat limited experience as the son of a pathologist and a nurse, Martel DOES manage to capture how deliriously boring and maimingly monotonous a medical convention can be (otorhinolaryngologists no less, their motto would rightly be "fun with phlegm"), particularly when held in a craphole motel (think Leaving Las Vegas' witty "The Whole Year Inn"-cum-"The Hole You're In") and further exacerbated by a tediously planned dramatization of how to conduct a patient interview (a device Martel must have found brilliant since she devotes exponentially more time to this than anything else).
This is a meandering, rather oddball film which hopefully gave its stars a nice vacation in Italy (at a time when production was booming there), but did nothing for their careers.
Even when that happens, neither guy kisses either girl!
There are any number of funny situations that are set up, but there is hardly ever pay-off, and the few times when Phillips does come through he doesn't come through nearly enough.
In an era when most TV cop shows were slick and glib and sometimes striving for a touch of glamor, "Starsky & Hutch" moved around in a world of pimps and prostitutes, drug pushers and lowlifes.
I was really disappointed, when I heard that Stiller and Wilson were playing the lead roles, I would have preferred the original actors, even if they are both in their 60's.
I was very worried when I heard Ben Stiller was making this movie and my fears came true.
The film offers a couple of chuckles, most notably when the big car jump at the end goes wrong, but it's hardly worth sitting through all the mundane characters and groan-inducing comedy to get to them.
My intelligence was offended when 'Starsky' drives his car, like a maniac, out into the public street does a couple of 'donuts' in front of other police cars and then does a 180Âº to pick up his new, unwanted, partner.
He's right when he says that there's no good way to convey through language how abominably bad the movie is.
Not quite as action-packed as _Manos: The Hands of Fate_, the movie centers around a group of people in a remote cabin who don't know what to do when they get word of some sort of plague (FX supplied by Red Devil red smokeballs) striking the rest of the planet.
Jack Lemmon stars as George Kellerman, a Midwesterner who finally gets that `big chance' when his company offers him a job in New York City.
The very derivative soundtrack jumps the shark when "Jake" goes for help in his snowmobile, to the tune of "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"!
And that's when the movie gets worse, if that's possible.
Stan, along with Sarah's love-interest Eric(Karl Wallace)and prick Andy(Robert Arkens)were preparing to return home when Jake encountered a warning from a sickened airstrip operator who insisted he not land due to a mysterious plague spreading across rural America.
What makes matters worse is when Andy takes off in Jake's plane, feeling the effects of a ray used by the Martians with the result being a crash.
There's plenty of ridiculous dialog; here's a sample: when a know-it-all guy theorizes (ready?)
And with nowhere to go at 2:30am, despite George's stupidity of not calling ahead, the hotel kindly offers him a room FREE OF CHARGE at 7am when others leave.
Roth, an actor I truly like, seems to go along with the sleepy mood and not even when he kicks the bad guys on the balls he seems to wake up.
Paris Hilton (while stupid) is no dummy when it comes to money.
That will help them a lot when they get out in the real world, and think that having a pink cell phone and Vuitton handbag will equip them for reality.
Rule #1 when you're an out-of-towner visiting a "big" city: Don't draw any more attention to yourself than you already have.
Rule #2 is more basic than Rule #1 (this goes even for when you're at home).
Too much junk like 12oz mouse with no plot, adult swim is good for some laughs but only when the show actually spends some money on production and writing.
I don't know, but I do know that it's not funny when I watch, not funny afterward, and not funny before.
Now, this next statement might only convey that I've been spoiled by living a nice, sheltered life in a first world country, but the reason this doesn't work is that misanthropy is only funny when people are randomly slaughtered left and right (Robot Chicken).
The show gets the viewer to empathize with Tom so strongly, that in the second season, when several stories see Tom accidentally kill and maim much of Jefferton, it became truly cathartic and hilarious, partly because Tom is the last guy on earth who'd hurt a fly, yet he truly deserves to eviscerate every last Jeffertonian.
I actually laughed aloud at "Jeffy" when Tom, piloting a fake sea serpent, crushed several boatloads of people, and later (though not the last episode), we get our happiest moment as Tom is finally granted the sweet release of death, and takes half the town with him.
When some people complained that this film "glorified" or "made light" of this serious issue, this final line of the film was cut when the film first was shown on television.
Basically--and yes I need a new paragraph for this--I simply can't stand it when a movie is not a movie, but instead a stock car race of plot vehicles vrooming around a track, racing to get to the great, meaningful, dramatic, thematic finish.
Because please, all I'm asking for are two true hours, a darkened interstice of theatrical time when I don't for once have to slap my knee with a rolled up paper, clap my palm to my forehead in an exclamatory wince because I've just been suckered again.
the ins and outs of the racer and the team owners conflict opponent show that when bad writing hits, not even a tried and true money maker can make money.
A serious bit of miscasting took place when they filled the role of Jean.
The sound was muddled, camera work was sloppy when it should have been straight (you can experiment but that not terribly) and the music was purely awful.
At the end of the play we see very little of a shift in character outside of the fact that she has a bit of an airy gait and inflection when she is asking Jean to come up to her room alongside her.
First, when they are on their flight to New York, the pilot says that everyone on board will have to go to Boston (after much time consumed circling over the big city, due to weather conditions), they lose their luggage when they arrive at the Boston airport (and try to find it in a panic, while hurrying to catch a train), they hustle by cab over to one station to board a train, but Gwen has to go to the women's room, but can't find it due to hurrying to make the train (the one they board has no one on but a cleaning lady, and they miss the one they were looking for, which was next to the empty one), then they hustle to another station to get on board one and try to get something to eat on a car with almost no food, they arrive later on at a transit station in New York and discover that all of the transportation services are on strike, so they walk in the rain to their hotel, and Gwen breaks the heel on her shoe while walking before they arrive, only to discover that their room was given away to someone else after the 10 pm deadline, then they walk with a man who helps them find another room (only to rip them off by robbing them at gunpoint, taking George's wallet), then they try to go to the police station to report the guy who scammed them, then go the armory by the police, only to get their route foiled by some liquor store robbers, they get dumped in the park and mugged by a stranger at 4 am while sleeping under a tree (George's watch was taken while he was sleeping), then they find Cracker Jack on a bench for breakfast (that a dog steals almost immediately, which George breaks a tooth on, causing him to whistle on his spoken S's), they get chased by a cop on horseback for an assumed problem with a child in the park, and more funny situations to come.
You know a movie has misfired when despite such notable actors it goes through so many desperate name changes: Debuting as "The Grotesque" (its source name), barely released to theaters as ""Gentlemen Don't Eat Poets," then to video as "Grave Indiscretions."
That would explain a few of the gaffes in the film, like the time when the car runs over the human at top speed, leaving neither the car nor the human with any visible physical injury.
Or the time when a character is shot from across the room (in the back) by two men struggling on the ground with the gun.
And my very favorite moment of the film, when a woman leaps out of a high window, the old woman she's walking with has to run to the window and look down before reacting in horror.
O'Brien is one who DID change his name when he turned to comedy writing.
I can only hope that when this film was released, people laughed as hard as I did.
It all comes to a head when sweet Mary finds herself compromised by a craven Bogarter and then murdered.
The film definitely shows how outdated it is in several ways - like when two characters are discussing a third one and indicate he's a bad egg, after all his parents are(gasp)divorced!
oh yeah...interesting...this movie was made when marijuana was legal in the usa.
In fact, they're so clean cut, nice to their parents and just plain perfect that you're actually happy when their lives turn bad.
A primal no-no of screen writing is the over-use of time jumps, you know, when there is 1 minute of action then a flash on the screen telling is "two years later" etc.
I'm not convinced that it's inherently harmful, when consensual, so I'm not going to judge it.
One funny scene in this movie is when an old "chief:" goes out like his ancestors.
His brother Hank Storm (Lou Diamond Phillips) is understandably annoyed & when he saves McHenry's life as Marino shoots him & leaves him for dead the two team up to bring Marino down, prove McHenry's innocence & get the Indian tribal lance back...
(1982) to Lethal Weapon (1987) & it's sequels to Midnight Run (1988) to Tango & Cash (1989) to The Last Boy Scout (1991) to the more recent Rush Hour (1998) & sequels to name but a few fine examples, unfortunately when compared to shining lights of the sub genre like the aforementioned Renegades is just plain poor in every department by comparison.
It's not hard now, when lines too pedestrian to even laugh at are recited for the tenth, twelfth, twentieth time.
However, when you decide to watch it up against the original you realize it is still a weak movie.
It is kind of creepy that they meet when Anakin was a child and he had a little crush on her and it has turned into this full born obsession.
We even get a glimpse into Darth Vader when Anakin slaughters Tuskan Raiders after they are responsible for the death of his mother.
The movie seemed to jump from scene to scene in the most illogical places, action scenes got interrupted, and just when you were getting into a better scene, you get hit with yet another boring "but I love you, but I am Jedi, oh no, boohoo"-scene.
Excuse me, but since when has Star Wars been a soap opera instead of an adventure?
There used to be a time when Star Wars was the best thing since sliced bread.
Script aside Star Wars has always been something of an effects movie but these days it's simply not impressive enough when compared to Lord of the Rings.
I am glad I am not a fan of the series its bad enough Im a religious follower of the Bond Tradition when something like DAD opens.
They play two small-town Americans who think promotion and a life in New York is Nirvana itself when in fact it is a hell that even Dante could not envisage and no-one can capture the comedy of escalating awfulness better than Simon, at least in America.
Usually, when someone butchers a whole village of men, women, and children there's a whole lot more soul searching going on afterward.
In fact, when I was littler, The Empire Strikes Back was my favorite film.
Probably my favorite line *POSSIBLE SPOILER* was when Anakin (or little Ann(ie?,y?,e??)
*NO MORE SPOILERS* The plot is so delightfully convoluted that thousands of viewers at home will be able to watch this movie in less than half it's running time when it comes out on VHS.
Jimmy Stewart was never a very gritty actor, and he always seemed to play weak men in dramatic roles and nice guys when he was in comedies.
Jimmy Stewart, a real life war veteran, curiously agreed to play a role as a seemingly gutless pacifist sheriff who takes action only when events turn horrific enough to make any man thirst for vengeance.
Holy Cross purports to be a true representation of the horrifying and shaming events in Belfast back in 2001 when Catholic schoolgirls were subjected, by protesting loyalists, to a tunnel of verbal and physical abuse on their way to classes.
The most beautiful shot comes near the climax when Palance's character get's out of his car and walks into his club.
I mean come one when you are sneaking across a maniacal doctors compound why would you run right for the spot light?
Sure, it starts out OK, but when Billy's sister gets in there, it becomes completely implausible.
Portia de Rossi tries hard, but is hobbled by the bad script (it is, for example,not well explained why she is so good with a gun, and then not well utilized when push comes to shove).
I first saw it when I was a teenager back in the 1980's, but I rented it just last week because I needed to be cheered up.
This is the type of movie that when you watch it it will make your day.
The whole movie was hilarious, but I thought the funniest parts of the movie for me were 'The Car Chase' when George and Gwen went along on a high speed chase in the police car that was supposed to take them to the armory.
Of course, she can't get a word in edgewise when she contacts her daughter (Reva Rose, who had just come off of playing Lucy in Off-Broadway's "Your a Good Man Charlie Brown") since the phone man disconnects her.
And when he openly sexually harasses the seemingly willing Joan Delaney (as the younger new female cop assigned to help him capture Davis and Borgnine), he just takes the character into dimensions that would have today's film audiences up in arms.
I burst out laughing several times, especially when Julia, the daughter of Augustus, meets a lover.
I recall the soap opera my mother watched when I was a child having better dialog than this.
The second is when the prop gun spends an entire scene floating in water next to the actors.
Don't you hate it when a worthy topic is wasted on a bad film?
His mother is a society-conscious old battle-ax--and when she learns of the marriage between her well-connected son and a common circus performer, she blows a gasket and demands the wedding be stopped.
Be ready to hit the fast-forward button when any song occurs!
A root canal, at least, when it's all over, turns out to have been worthwhile time well spent.
I should have remembered that when you see a ton of complimentary comments by critics all over the DVD cover, you can be almost guaranteed the film is a stinker.
So beware when you get this--this is a soft-core horror film with more groaning and moaning than I thought was possible!
So blood and guts were only quite good, when they had every ability to be better.
There are times when Isabel's choices call into question her judgment, one of them being why she'd pick Alex over her ex-boyfriend Chuy, when he is being played by dark, confident Carlos Gomez.
But can she really have much respect for Alex, when she's leading him around like a puppy dog?
I've read the book when I was a little boy, read it again when I became an adult and read it a few times more during my adulthood.
If The Out of Towners has a flaw, it's that there are slight logical problems when it comes to the Kellermans getting into their increasingly difficult conundrums.
Still, there are times when the characterization isn't quite in tune with the characters' decisions.
Just when you thought you had seen one of Dennis Hopper's worst movies ever, along comes "The Amarican Way", and a new contender for worst of the worst is born.
In fact, the only relief from the random dialog in the plane is the few welcome moments when the viewer is back on planet earth, a place this entire production has never been.
There's a spontaneous combustion, one poor woman dies when a mirror explodes in her face and another bloke's shotgun backfires on him.
Funny, this very guy is the one who invited the young lady and the gentlemen to his home and he seemed just fine when he invited them.
SPOILERS AHEAD: I remember seeing this one when it came out  in theaters and being alternately amused and aggravated by its  hokey, convoluted plot, which seems to borrow themes from  several good sources dealing with black magic, the supernatural,  and even Agatha Christie (as there is a "Ten Little Indians" type  device in which the guests are mysteriously knocked-off one by  one).
Things start to go wrong in the very first reel when Katherine Ross and Sam Elliott arrive in England where Ross has a job waiting for her.
Just when this monotonous method gets very tedious, the movie ends, and you can watch some very well made cartoon end credits (surely they wanted to make up for the rest of the movie).
Basically we all know Anna and Johan will get back together, but first the plot has to be manipulated so that we can give some sex scenes to the roommate, to an different couple, to Anna with other people, and lets not forget the obligatory lesbian scene to say nothing of the big sex scene when they are finally reunited.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, a former member of The Doors knows a beautiful girl when he sees one, and there are periodic sequences involving the simply stunning Jennifer Lothrop undulating scantily clad (for artistic reasons, of course).
Through some careful shots and repetitive music we see the story pan out as any other romantic comedy would and there are minimal surprises to generate a good watch, particularly when the humour is gross out and shamefully degrading to the actors.
So was Leonard Maltin when he gave it 1 and 1/2 stars, although his use of the word "appalling" is pretty much on target.
but she's very annoying and her jaggerish lips get in the way when she talks and that accent is so thick.
but bill paxton is great especially when he is pointing his rife at anthony m. hall and his pretty blonde girlfriend, and he bangs hall's head with the nozzle and then bangs the girl in the head.
But I should've known when I looked the lead dude up and saw that he was in Ong-Bak's credit nether regions as 'bodyguard #4'.
But just as I thought "Karate Kid" was amazing when I was a kid (I laugh at the lameness of the fight sequences now) I imagine most adults will laugh at just about everything in this film.
An ex-girlfriend insisted we see First Knight when it came out in 1995.
Unfortunately, on a recent Saturday morning, when my FIOS package let me down again (oh, for reruns of MST3K!
I can remember when he made a splash in Paul Scharder's American Gigolo (1980).
There were scenes when I thought he was actually in danger of nodding off on his sword!
Godard shows no respect to Allen at all, yet Allen shows a great deal of politeness and respect to Godard even when Godard belts out questions in French without allowing his off-camera translator to catch up or be heard over his voice.
I believe that, based on what I have seen of Godard's work, which is entirely self-regarding and faux artsy even when it is good, that he is a jealous intellectual snob.
I liked Daffy Duck when he was, well, daffy...he has been smart aleck duck for a while now.
Generally speaking, I enjoy it when film makers expose a fringe subculture that is basically unknown to the general viewing audience.
I never laughed so much in my life when Kate got what she had coming to her in the end of the sequel.
And, when I watch a horror movie (with the exception of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA), I tune in to watch horror--not see song after song after song.
Karloff rarely performed in color until late in his career when most films were in color.
But, just to make sure, plans to either kill her or destroy her vocal cords--it's hard to tell which he's about to do when the housekeeper confronts him--of course, with no backup or witnesses!!
Even when Karloff (at one point) knocks out Ludwig Stossel, our lack of interest in the "little old wine maker" actor prevents us getting too concerned (Ludwig recovers by the way).
Who cares about the mortal baddies when the immortal have to be killed?
I always watch films to the end of the titles but I was sooo glad when the, "Action", finished, I couldn't bear to see the names associated with this monstrosity.
The way the characters flip-flop back and forth (about what to do with the money) when their lives are at stake is laughable.
She was one of a handful of actors that refused to honor the great Director, Elia Kazan, when he was honored by the Academy.
He identified known communists in the film industry when ordered to do so by not only the film companies but also under penalty of perjury by Congress.
At first the audience was quiet and respectful but (when it became clear that nothing was happening) they got restless.
There was some laughter when Seyrig seems to be seducing Karlen and people just roared when a detective pops in for no earthly reason.
when i got there the line was crazy out the door, they were only letting in the first 500 people, but we managed to get in.
Lise has a mother who goes to pieces when her ex-husband dies, motivating Lise to run away to see Gwen.
Also, somehow the apartment she showed up at when looking for Aggie has turned into "Mary Turner's apartment", as one of Joe's goons says when he answers the phone.
We see Joe's eyes bug out when Mary says "marked money" ... incredibly this naive virgin waif is all of a sudden more street-smart than longtime hoodlum and gang-head Joe?!
She's still a frigid little virgin, as he suddenly realizes when he tries to kiss her (just as Joe had earlier in the movie).
All of a sudden, Little Lech Junior turns into Mister "I'm Soooo in Love With You" when his virgin Mary grabs her coat and heads for the door.
Especially when the end result is as dismal as it is here.
The first thirty odd minutes of this focuses almost entirely on Will, Jayne & Darren & feels more like a teen soap opera than a horror film & when the horror elements do eventually kick in they are pretty lame with Will trying to be turned into a Vampire & a bit of bickering between Julien & Claudius to see who is harder but they both come across as wimps anyway & really don't put up much of a fight at a very weak climax.
Partly because he has good lines and partly because he plays the role well, but only when he is in drag mode.
The whole scenario is absurd, which is fine, but the actors play it "straight" (for lack of a better word) too much, with the exception of the villains and the drag queen (but only when she's in drag).
Anyway, Android of Notre Dame is no better than the others, and it isn't particularly disgusting either, and that is a achievement when we're talking about Guinea Pig films!
Bava excelled when he was able to put aside plot and character and just focus on atmosphere, but this film did not allow him to do that.
We're back in the Great Valley again, and this time the haven is disrupted when the water that feeds it stops flowing.
The film quality was comparable to a home movie, and I had a good laugh when the fly was buzzing about in a scene with Beth and her father.
It did look much like a bad comedy with no climactic scenes at all!I was laughing out loud when her and the psychic had the "silent" conversation with each other!
Not really what we were looking for when we started watching.
You know they are acting, but when you can actually remember throughout the film that they are just acting, it's not really good.
I kept having 90210 flashbacks when she spoke and laughed in the movie.
I have very low expectations when it comes to low budget crap like this.
I first saw WWHTKB when it was screened in my hometown film festival two years ago at one in the morning on a Saturday.
Then again, I only saw this movie when it was on TV and commercials were continually interrupting things.
Alternating between the black-suited evacuation agents (working for "lakefront" land when the dam creates that valuable acreage) and a phantasmagorical collection of weirdos, the film develops neither theme coherently or even interestingly.
Another example is when a team of dam employees responsible for the evacuation of the residents arrives at the dam headquarters, another group of people are departing.
The only exciting part, and this lasts only about two minutes, occurs when one of the soon-to-be-evicted homeowners starts shooting at the state employees who come to tell him he has to leave.
But I could not feel the energy coming from her or Colin Farrell even when it came from the love scenes.
Question: who was the mole in the FBI?,where was the rest of the story,where's sonny's alligator Superfluous love scenes,villains that can't shoot eg:all those dead bad guys and one wounded cop when they do the exchange at the finale.Plus points:it looked glossy and Jamie Foxx nailed Tubbs .
Movie was made, but that movie isn't that good.In the movie "Miami Vice" we've got lots of famous people,like director Michael Mann,actors Colin Ferrell,Jamie Foxx,Naomie Harris and lots more.Producers succeeded to hire big shot stars on this movie so they can replace actors from series.But they couldn't.Script of the movie is not that bad and we all know what Michael Mann is capable to do but it didn't work with this film.First of all this movie is too long.It is so long that I almost fall asleep in the cinema.Second,actors like Collin Farrell and Jamie Foxx are good actors but they cannot pull this one on their back.Collin Farrell is trying to be different from Don Johnson but he just can't do it.Don Johnson is so much better then Farrell in this role.Jamie Foxx played well,although I don't like him as an actor.And also I have to say that these two actors are good choice but why did they made this movie?To bring them money.There are lots of locations but why do they call it "Miami Vice" when the plot is not set in Miami.They could call it "World Vice" instead.I didn't enjoyed in this movie,but maybe my expectations where too big.I like Mann's camera and he really knows his job.The things I didn't liked where some scenes where Ferrell could do a better job and I also don't know why is this movie so long.It gets boring toward the end.Even though this movie has lot of famous people, it hasn't got some thing so I can say that movie is fine.It lacks of magic.
And when he spoke, you would have thought God was talking.
Elizabeth Rodriguez as Gina had the best scene in the whole movie, when she shot the Nazi.
I mean Switek is in the middle of the bad guys and they barely even notice him when the shooting starts.
Purely pie-in-the-mush humor here, with gags that were old when the film was made forty years ago.
At least when the SARS-AID show in Toronto was going to help Toronto recover from the SARS epidemic.
I'm sorry, call me cynical, I do think music is important and effects our lives in a meaningful way but when I think Geldof has kind of lost his mind.
Just when you think you struggled yourself through all the lousiest and most pointless slasher the 80's decade had to offer, you allow yourself to be fooled by yet another one.
Obviously, for most parts this movie isn't meant seriously (there's a hilarious Robert DeNiro-like character called Nick Duran who curses in a ridiculously rude manner and who even gets to sing his own little song when the credits roll) but on the other hand the makers also seemed eager to gain the respect of horror audiences.
Wittgenstein lived at a time when categories like "homosexual" weren't as firm as today.
I have to say this film is a big disappointment especially when you see the actors in it.
I made the point of approaching the film with an open mind considering "The Basketball diaries" was one of my favourite novels when I was a teenager.
Each time I see a movie like this one,I think about the exterior conditions required for making a standout.When Pierre Grimblat made "Lisa",he did not lack,on an exterior plan,anything that Welles had when he made Touch of Evil ,or that Fellini had when he made Ginger e Fred ,or that Fuller,Kitano,and a few others had when they made their movies.It's not about budget,sets,etc.,external conditions,that is.
The main character in this movie is a high school girl named Janet who puts on an act in front of the other girls at school to make them laugh...when really she's dieing inside.
Janet goes to the club to do research for her paper when she meets Tony (I told you what I said had a purpose).
I don't even remember when or where I picked up this turkey, couldn't have been more than a buck.
I'm a pretty tolerable person when it comes to movies, even ones that the majority of people consider to be terrible.
It also has a blasphemous scene early on when they hold a "wake" for the paper and smugly use Christian terms (i.e.
This movie gave me some hearty belly laughs when I saw it on cable recently.
The dialogue, when not delivered with brain-numbing monotonality, is just too stupid for words.
Indeed it's hard to keep a straight face when the acting is this universally horrid and that our would be hero (Looking like Gary Busey without the sex appeal)starts waxing philosophical questions such as "Is it really his fault?
The movie was amusing in a "bad is good" kind of way, and certainly brought back some fond and not so fond memories of that 1989 period when I was roaming over the Dallas area looking for excitement.
When THE TERMINATOR came out, it spawned a flood of films using the basic theme of killer androids / cyborgs (some films classify their robots as "cyborgs" when they are just androids).
Coldyron quits when forced by his superiors to activate the prototype within sixty days, an impossible timeframe.
Soon the police are forced to call Coldyron back in to help when the robot begins chasing a female motorist across the Texas countryside.
This was back in the days when you could rent videos from newsagents, before laws were introduced to stop the assistants from recommending films.
Watch for the bit when R.O.T.O.R.
It takes five minutes for someone to get from Point A to Point B, when it should take around 30 seconds max.
Even when they enter the house and drown a woman in her bathtub, they say nothing.
I love horror movies and I love independent movies, when they are done right.
Stick with the underrated BLACK Christmas and the deserved cult classic Christmas EVIL when it comes to X-mas horror.
Add the fact that Revolutions as well as Reloaded were a huge disappointment... who knew it would end this way 5 years ago when we were all in awe of The Matrix... don't you hate sad endings?
Some of the obvious problems with the film are the use of silent film footage (when shown on a normal projector, it runs too fast and looks odd), clips of a baby being delivered by c-section (for little apparent reason other than they happened to have the film and decided to shove it into the movie) as well as choppy editing and poor acting.
Supposedly wild parties and a guy ripping the dress off his wife when he ran out of drugs are among the more outlandish scenes in this film--that, by this point, has become an almost plot less mess.
for a white man to sing mammy in black face go down to a black neighborhood and tell the people that.As a non-black that lived in black districts I can tell you it upsets them.When this movie came out on TV in the 1960's it made me cringe because I knew a lot of people around me were going to be upset.Yes,the good old 1960's when the riots started,showing a movie like this didn't help prevent them.The people that support and broadcast-ed this movie go around oblivious to realty.While their safe in a sheltered world during the riots I'm on the funky streets trying to be on time for the graveyard shift.Some persons now believe Leif Erickson discovered America instead Of Columbus.A change is needed in movie history too.In the best interest of a happier society I'd like for this movie not to be given any claim to fame,sweep it under the rug.May a technicality give the fame to a more decent film.
This was old even in 1927 when this was made.
When the sound came on when he was signing I kept hoping it could switch back to silent!
German words fail this Count (that's a perfect excuse for a silent film fanÂ) when we think about what "The Jazz Singer" meant to film history.
For example when one of the cops is in the bath and he starts eating a banana!
This becomes most apparent when after around about 70 interminable minutes enter Matt Lucas, with an almost (I said almost!)
Near the end, when the female detective was sitting at the bench with the two guards in the towers, what went on there?
Wasn't it funny when that actress nearly drowned, just because some schmuck of a director couldn't get the shot that he wanted?
How about when Henry Silva, an actor petrified of heights, almost p*ssed himself with fear because a camera crew took him 70ft off the ground without warning him?
I didn't bother going to see it, since I hadn't seen the original, but planned to eventually watch them both when I got around to it.
It seems like it will go on for all eternity, and as I watched, I really wondered when it was going to end, and didn't see any possible way it COULD end!
The worst part is when the main characters daughter participates in the killing of a woman freely, but is apprehensive about consuming her flesh.
I watched quite a while back, so can't really comment on the editing, etc - but the bitter after-taste still lingers and when I came across it here on IMDb, had to vent some latent frustration that had been pent up.
However any shred of ethos that can be derived from this movie is instantly lost when faces with the overwhelming fact that the person telling us this is Keanu Reeves.
Who hasn't known women who, like Bitch, think of themselves as feminists when, in fact, they're really just bitchy?
coming from a huge horror fan, i normally have an open mind watching new horror films but i had to rate this film a 1, when it really deserves a -86. this not only was one of the complete worst movies i have ever seen, it is a complete disgrace to horror movies in general.
second of all, i thought this was a slasher, since when do slashers not have any blood/gore?
What do you get when you take the greatest survival horror video game series and have a complete idiot(Paul W.S.
This movie was so bad, i thought i was infected with the T-Virus when i had a strange urge to eat the brains of the people next to me in the movie theater... but they wouldn't mind, they were watching the most brainless movie ever.
Case in point is when Alice, after blasting away some zombies, spins her two guns, a la John Wayne, before putting them back in the holsters.
Things further complicate when "Nemesis", the movie's biggest, toughest monster, arrives for the sole purpose of killing just about everything he perceives as a threat.
However, even when ignoring the numerous plot holes -- which is almost an impossibility -- the story itself is still laughable, revolving partly around an insipid "fight for survival" that seems to rely on the main group splitting up and one of the subgroups being brutally slaughtered for no good reason, with the other part being about Alice (a character invented by the script-writer, as she was never in the game it is very loosely-taken from) and her relationship with the monster "Nemesis".
And when Atwill is on screen, he's reduced to playing the role of the most embarrassing red herring I've ever run across.
Watch for Eric Roberts' sneaker/tux combo when he and his team first enter the hotel.
After all it had a good premise, fake kidnapping of the President goes bad when someone decides to make it real.
I must say that since the first time i saw it I have bought it on tape and when I got a dvd player i bought it for that too.
but the worst scene was when the attackers moved in a small room and the special forces attacked them by entering the room firing rapidly with their m16s and some how they did not hit anyone then the attackers used a smoke grenade to push the special forces outside the small room.
I was surprised when they used the ultimate tom and jerry prank were the good guy literally pulled the carpet from underneath the bad guy sending him into a magnificent somersault in the air.
It was hard to get into the story when it was only delivered in small chunks amidst frequent commercials.
If you want some advice, rent the original and watch it with the lights turned down, preferably late at night when it's all quiet outside.
Why is it that Hollywood chooses to remake perfectly good movies and then make them worse when they do?
I saw this movie when it came out in 1979 (ironically at the same drive-in theater I managed in 1990) and it scared the daylights out of me then, and it still creeps me out today!
The possible exception is when the ball kills the care taker, but that is pretty mild by today's standards, so I wouldn't recommend it to little kids, or the faint of heart.
The appearance of Michelle Yeoh in Tomorrow Never Dies and then Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon piqued my interest in the lady's earlier films and when this one came up cheap on DVD, I jumped at the chance to acquire it.
Since when has ANY "First Lady" looked that good?
(2) Or, we are living in alternative past created when the Future sent the sample back to our universe.
The problem is, when length is more important a goal than quality, nothing can be left on the cutting-room floor.
(Trekkie alert: as a C-list actor, Schenkkan is best remembered for eating an alien cockroach and then getting his head blown up, when he played Commander Remmick in the ST:TNG first-season episode "Conspiracy".)
This miniseries was mostly a 7.5 or so for me, until the last half of the final part where they proceeded to:  - Basically ignore (they threw in a casual explanation) the two survivors of Piedmont sub-plot   - Ignore the sub-plot (even if it was a horribly clichÃ©d one) of the estranged wife of Dr Stone, and rebellious son   - Ignore the fact that there were airborne rubber eating Andromedas above Piedmont when the helicopters flew over   - Turn the Andromeda strain into a visible on-screen entity   - Provide no clear reason for why Dae Kims character died upon throwing a thumb   - Flub the ending of the reporter sub-plot, so it became a total "Who Cares?"
- Give Andromeda an actual (and completely dumb) origin, rather than leave it mysterious like the novel   - Bore us all to death with environmentalist clichÃ©d 1960s Star Trek-esquire moralising   - Bore us past death to "government conspiracy" plot line that's so horribly overdone   - Provide no reason as to why there was lots of rubble falling down the central shaft  But perhaps the most burning of the flaws with this miniseries was the action that occurred when the nuclear fail-safe was activated.
I am, of course referring to when it's played during the closing credits by professionals, not when Facinelli "sings" it during the rave scene.
for example when johnny is chasing the ex presidents in his car after they had robbed a bank why did he not call for backup to cut them off?
The agent, Keanu Reeves, is shown getting close to a surfer gal in order to get 'in' with the surfers; he tells her his parents died (which is a lie--they are still alive, we later find out, in Ohio) to gain sympathy from her, because he has found out thru records that her parents died in an accident when she was a child.
She has 3 modes: self-righteous indignation when she's wronged; self-righteous indignation when someone else is wronged; self-righteous indignation with a little girl voice when she's willing to have sex.
Too bad people prefer quantity over quality when it comes to entertainment.
It should have ended when it needed to, when it should have, which was Season 4.
Of course, I was also younger when I started watching, and my tastes have developed a good deal since then.
Things would happen, and never be referenced at all again when it was needed.
The show was never really good, i mean, it had SOME moments, brief ones, in episodes where things seem to have been written actually well, but is just lost when the inane writing truly shows its colors.
Sometimes when it comes to television shows or movies about teens or young adults, it depends not only on the script but the casting and the talent of the actors.
At my school the kids playing this type of attack were arrested, but what about the other kids from the other schools that were not so lucky, how do you think they felt when the turned on the TV for their weekly does of One Tree Hill?
I'm not exaggerating when I say that this summary adequately covers any and all content this movie has to offer.
Unfortunately, Turning Gate (as well as most of Hong's other movies) is so devoid of content that the only people that will enjoy this movie are those who say to themselves, "Man, I yearn to remember the days when I banged a different person every week with no strings attached."
To close, I'd like to also communicate my displeasure with other reviewers who have imposed informative psychological content INTO the film when the filmmaker himself failed to do so.
And why bother to move the victim, when the entire location is so remote?
This movie butchers it's only selling point when during the "love scene" the wholly untalented miss Vincent stays covered, unlike in Cabin Fever when she is involved in multiple raunchy scenes.
Yes this movie is bad...the only good part is that Cerina Vincent is hot...other than that....I cried when I watched this movie because it makes Jeepers Creepers look good...I watched it all the way...twice...only twice because I wanted to show my friend how bad it was.
I'd have to say the story and the way Danny St. Claire goes about calling her boss a 'Protoped' when she herself is still confused on the definition of said word.
The movie does share some beautiful scenery, which is ruined by dumb dialog riddled with clichÃ©, and a camera that is apparently attached to the back of a turtle, when not in the hands of a rampaging squirrel.
I usually dislike it when the characters fail to do the most logical choice.
at least when it happens too many times.
I was completely unconvinced by the female lead who looks like a Playmate stuffed into a forest ranger's uniform (oh, and she's supposed to be a former Marine, too...I actually giggled when she said that).
Movie rip-offs are only par for the course (especially in the horror genre), and I really don't mind someone else's idea expanded on, so to speak, but when your goal is no better than taking someone else's idea and regressing it to the same old, please don't bother.
We don't know originally that she caused the accident, but it's a "big revelation" when it's finally discovered.
We get a whole pile of them at the beginning of the movie, then when she's whining and crying and relating the whole story to her boyfriend, we get a whole pile of them again.
Unfortunately just when things seem to be picking up, we get this truly awful theme music, enough to completely ruin this part of the movie.
This kills any possibility of excitement or suspense and shifts your attention to wondering what the director could possibly have been thinking when he chose this crap.
- the creature is basically introduced as someone with a breathing problem running around with a shaky camera, hiding in the scrub and generally exuding bad attitude... when it gives our "heroes" a scare naturally they reach for the bottle of booze.
How many times do we need to see someone skipping out into the woods in the middle of the night when they know there's a monster bumping people off?
Spidey giving up his spideyness has been done before and better in Superman II when he gave up his powers for Lois.
Not content to describe once how good certain parts of a child's body were when roasted and eaten, it describes the heinous deeds in fact and again in a first person voice-over narrated by an actor playing Albert Fish.
It is mysterious that the film runs about 63 minutes when the main IMDb description has it released at 57 minutes.
A prominent but discredited doctor tricks a group of criminals onto a ship to continue his experiments on healing the criminal mind, but the criminals have other ideas when they decide to take over the ship.
Anyhow this Iron Eagle sequel finds Gossett putting together a bunch of no-name Canadian actors, some who play Americans and some who play Russians who when they splice in the 'we can't get along together because of nationality' clichÃ© story element, you have this movie in a nutshell.
I was excited when I heard about this movie and eagerly tuned in to watch when lo and behold you see the hero from the first Iron Eagle, Jason Gedrick, get KILLED in the first 5 minutes!
Then that's when I started getting upset and hating this movie and everything about it....that clinched it....
This movie continues to be the only movie I have ever walked out on...I watched up to the point where his fly buddy that is up there when he gets killed sits down with the Russians to plan the attack to take place later in the film and then I couldn't take it anymore...I never saw what happens next, nor do I ever care to find out.....
What do you do when you're a young director with a hit on your hands?
Like many teenage boys in the 80's I wanted to wipe out a Middle Eastern country of my own, but was never given the opportunity, so when I heard that there was going to be an Iron Eagle 2 I was very excited.
Especially when you got one of the characters trying to carry himself like the Maverick character in Top Gun.
Later, when Mitchum is treating Hayworth badly, Lemmon assumes the role of Sir Galahad and defends her.
As each element of the masters tragic life was revealed to me, I kept wondering when the turn-around point would be.
For the final speech scene which I hung on for, the master turned out the most embarrassing self pitying display I have ever seen on film -- something like my grandfather when he's had too many drinks at Christmas.
Im sorry, but I really do find it hard to believe that this film nominated for an award and would suggest that viewers modify their expectations if they are anticipating an award winning feature when booking to see.
"Very loud,"The Producers" "- as Noel Coward might have said.10 minutes of it goes a long way.I remember the posters on the Underground when the movie first came out.
His older brother one time makes out with this mysterious blonde and he freak when he sees one of the Tall Man's minions running around the graveyard.
They pile lie upon lie when they could easily have told the truth about their parents.
So don't come and complain that we're rating this as an adult's film when it isn't, because you rate films on what they're meant to be.
Initially it seems they've bitten off more than they can chew, especially when cruel dog pound troops, nagging foster parents and pesky cops begin to take notice of the incredibly large gathering of dogs at the dilapidated old building.
Clearly this film wasn't designed for me, but the trite dialogue (Kevin Dillon mutters the stale line, "We're in deep doo doo," after falling into an enormous animal waste bin), the predictability of Bernie's role, the sappy ending and the Kill Bill music montage (Tomoyasu Hotei's instantly recognizable "Battle Without Honor or Humanity") are huge distractions Â especially when one just wants to see some adorable dogs running amok.
That's a sad commentary on the movie itself...when even the poop jokes aren't funny to little kids.
If you want to feel like Beavis and Butt-head when they watch something undescribable on TV, then this is the movie to create this emotion.
From the very beginning, when we see that all three lead actors are chosen for roles different than their own nationalities - an absolutely bizarre Anthony Hopkins with an atrocious American accent playing a character created out of some apparent hatred of Americans, a wee timid Campbell Scott playing an Englishman who had apparently never really left the nursery and an Isabella Rosselini playing a German hausfrau -- we realize something is seriously SERIOUSLY wrong here.
That's all the more frustrating when the end arrives with what I assume is an homage to Casablanca.
lastly, and probably the best of the SFX moments, is when one of the main characters starts twisting about and pukes up the evil ooze before exploding.
The Stuff takes over their bodies and when it's done using them, it eats their insides and leaves through their mouths.
I first watched this film when I was 8 or 9 and it freaked me out beyond terror.
I wonder: What the Sci-Fi channel was thinking when they put on this muck?
I understand and can almost appreciate the attempted nostalgia, but when it so viciously devastates everything that made these movies good... they should have let this franchise be.
Of course, he goes to great lengths to play hero when she is kidnapped by two bumbling drug dealers when Ginny and her obnoxious jock boyfriend (Danny Nucci) inadvertently interfere in the deal.
But when a deal goes wrong, a young woman is kidnapped and is witnessed by Fraser (Stephen Dorff) a young man who's been following her around photographing her.
But then later on, to wit a touching, sentimental moment when he has a heart to heart and then loses his virginity to a prostitute?!?
But when a pair of dangerous, but not terribly bright criminals kidnap Dolenz to get ransom from her rich daddy, it's Dorff to the rescue, aided and abetted by former Green Beret Michael Dudikoff.
Maybe I should have seen this when I was a kid.
I was zapping through, looking for something to watch in a post-lunch Sunday afternoon when I stopped at this TV show which usually airs martial arts films.
I stood in rapt amazement when I saw that this week film would be "Iron Monkey II".
Most parts when they are trying to make it look like something is falling into place, it looks like they shot it falling (or CGI'd it) then shot a seperate cut with it in place.
In a ludicrous move, Eric Roberts portrays the assassin responsible for killing Stone's family when she was a little girl.
You know the film is in trouble when Stallone's lasagna lips render a good portion of the crummy dialog unintelligible and Stone responds by remarking how much she likes his voice.
Then, when James lost it on the phone with Sly, I think he earned his paycheck in ten minutes of screen time.
I especially enjoyed the scene when Sly blew the Crab Shack and it began raining live crustaceans.
So, two out of ten, with an extra point for being there when I needed it.
Now there is nothing inherently wrong with B-grade action movies, they can be entertaining in their own way, but the thing is when they are viewed they are picked up to be watched, you know what you're getting.
He is hired by May Munro, living under the name Adrian Hastings (Razzie winning Sharon Stone) to help get revenge on those responsible for killing her parents Stan (Chase Randolph) and Alice (Jeana Bell) when she was young (Brittany Paige Bouck).
For example, when rehashing the well worn cliche of hero deals with gang on bus, the violence is totally disproportionate to what the gang has done......and these little explosive devices that magically only take out one person (even knowing which way round they hold a saucer) are frankly dull  A bad plot with terrible acting and only semi-amusing stunts
The fact when one of the bombs went off in the room, one guy fell down before the other was also laughable.
She looks 35, now if her parents were killed when she was a little girl, shouldn't Tomas be a tad older(he looked the same age in her flashback) The Specialist would've been a great movie if the plot was better explained and more intense.
A pretty violent thing to see, but even more appealing when you're a horror fan.
Things become complicated when Ray's old CIA buddy turned baddie Ned Trent (James Woods) show's up wanting to kill Ray because he hurt Ned's feelings back in 1984 & that's it basically.
Apart from when Stallone beats some punks up on a bus there's no fights, there's no shooting, there's no car chases & the only explosions worth mentioning are right at the very end if you can make it that far.
The Specialist is a terrible film which I hated when I saw it back in the 90's & still hate now when I saw it but a few hours ago, there's nothing much more I can say other than I personally think it's complete rubbish except some decent explosions at the end which aren't worth waiting for.
Her character is so unlikeable I cheered up when Woods slapped her around.
The Turtles get their friend Casey Jones to guard the people from the past that will appear when the TMNT go back in time to find April.
Norinaga, when discovering April's escape, prepares to punish Niles.
Things are going great for the Turtles when Walker takes April hostage at gun point.
Basically, this is going to be such a short paragraph since the plot is really very simple, but here it goes, the turtles now have a time stick thing-a-ma-jig, so when April accidentally steps into it, she goes back to the 17th century in China switching places with the king's son, the turtles must go back and help April.
It takes their news reporter friend April (Paige Turco) with them while back in New York the humans from Japan who have another time device are in a bit of surprise when they realize they're not at home.
It's even worse when sequel is nearly enough to ruin a franchise, such as the third Ninja Turtles film.
It's definitely a bad sign when a low-budget sequel moves away from its original roots and goes in a different direction.
My biggest question has to be, when the hell did the turtles get herpes pock marks all over their body.
I mean, I was disappointed when I saw it the first time; and considering I loved the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, that has to mean something, right?
There are a number of signs you can spot to tell when a franchise is in trouble (like any rule, nothing concrete but generally well worth adhering to): an episode is set randomly in space, an episode features a crossover with another ailing franchise and/or an episode decides to pull out all the stops and go the time travel route.
This is ironic considering the craze pretty much had died down completely by 1993 when this movie came out.
When I saw this in the theaters when I was 9 in 1993 (you do the math) and honestly, as a kid, I thought it was OK.
This film is crappy when compared to the first (which was a masterpiece) and the second (which was OK) combined.
There are moments when it gets bad enough to be funny.
It's these points of the film that for me makes Phantasm an atmospheric and creepy horror gem, in fact it brings me back to when I was a five year old child in a video store in the 90's, traumatized by the VHS covers for Hellraiser and The Blob only to eagerly await the day I was old enough to view them.
This movie has creeped me out more than any other Horror classic ever could now and I'm far from the age I was when I used to be scared those films.
I will give it credit for having suspense, though it was the half-hearted, stressful kind of suspense you get when you are in denial about the fact that you are sitting through a numbingly pathetic excuse for a movie and you are clinging to a futile hope that in a couple of minutes it might get interesting.
The movie sounds creepy, and when matched with the mostly shot at night scenes and the wickedly gory rampages of those metallic spheres, the whole film takes on a most memorable feel.
There's always going to be that inevitable time when a person just runs out of ideas, and this film seems to be that moment for Abbott & Costello.
There are some funny moments (Lou whispering threats to the bad guys when they have their backs turned to him), a lovely leading lady (Hillary Brooke), some impressively trained animals, and some good special effects.
In any event, it was a 'one-off,' as A&C immediately returned to Universal afterward and stayed there until 1955, when they were dropped.
Joe Besser has one funny moment when he hears one of the others reveal a secret; he punches the guy on the arm and in his best spoiled-brat voice says, "Ooo, you're such a snitch!"
Shemp Howard, like Frank Buck, is nowhere to be seen during most of the action and when he is, has nothing amusing to do.
Scenes that were supposed to be serious like Aeris's death and when Tifa and a now vegetable Cloud tried to escape a destruction of this one village looked so ridiculous I couldn't help but laugh.
I CHEERED when she died!
It's even worse when you consider the fact that is part of the Final Fantasy series of RPGs, which are noted for their excellence.
The impact of the quality of the character development(or lack there of) can truly be seen when compared to the game's predecessor, Final Fantasy VI, which had excellent character development.
If the message of this film can truly be summed up when McCrea's character says "There's a lot to be said for making people laugh."
"Phantasm" has become known for the silver balls, and believe me -- when Angus Scrimm puts one of his balls in your face, you won't be happy about it.
I really enjoyed the effect of this (remember, this is 1979 when effects still took some creativity).
The movie is extremely boring, then at the end the movie explains how they were able to pull it off, when it was blatantly obvious the entire time.
Everyone probably thought they had seen the last of the caper movies when Sinatra et al.
"Things to do in Denver when you're dead" survived without a good looking bland central character so why does this film need one.
Helpful tip for people driving near prisons ... don't ever pick up hitchers, especially when sirens are wailing!
Kane ceased being cool when he lost his mask and the dropped the hideously scarred face plot line, so I really wasn't looking forward to this match that much.
I remember staying up late to watch this movie on TV when I was a kid.
I saw this in 1975 when it played a double-bill with "The Other Side Of The Mountain"; it came on second and proceeded to empty out the theater.
However, it is such an oddity that even when A&E's Biography did an hour on Margot Kidder's career, it wasn't even mentioned.
Also just when you think everything will be ok, it takes a new twist - everything then doesn't seem to make any sense at all.. and you just leave the cinema muttering "what was that all about".
It is a great credit to Gleeson that he turns in such a performance when given such a disgraceful script.
Trouble of course comes to all when a girl, with an inhuman build and deformed body, starts terrorizing all of them(plus the obligatory pizza guy and a homeless man).
The best sequence in "Butchered" occurs early on, when two girls are spanked with paddles by two other girls and then are forced to do "squishy" push-ups (you'll see what that means), as part of a sorority initiation.
But when the action moves on to the "haunted" house, the film offers nothing but derivative plotting, overacting, screaming, wandering around, watery blood and fake/exaggerated gore.
I remember my mother telling me about how much "Phantasm" scared her when she was a teenager, and she rented it one day and I watched it along with her (I was about nine or ten at the time), and it was genuinely one of the most bizarre movies I've ever viewed.
The film concludes leaving many questions open-ended and unanswered, but honestly - can you really expect genuine, fulfilling answers when the movie itself is so strange?
A case when husband is short and common, ordinary person and wife is tall, model-type, is bound to create confusions and complexes.
The film shows lot of promise when it begins but such a thin storyline is not backed by powerful script that requires interesting incidents and characters.
I wish Makers in general, should understand the fact that when such uncommon themes are chosen, more effort and homework is required in presenting a new angle as well as packing it with interesting elements.
This guy has zero charisma, but I have to give credit where credit is due: when it comes to the martial arts he knows what he is doing, his execution is fast and smooth.
The only time this dated stereotype produces a laugh is when she exclaims to Windsor Davies that an injured Ken is "bleeding terrible."
Though then again, the warning signs should show when it opens with a theme song by Kenny Lynch.
Nevertheless, he acts up a storm as renowned archaeologist 'Professor Roland Crump', whose lecture to a bored-looking Town Hall audience in the opening scene is enlivened when his 'film show' turns out to contain footage of a stripper (as the girl is about to remove her bra, an oblivious Williams intones: "Miss Fosdyke is about to reveal something of ENORMOUS interest!").
Also when the killing urge takes over you can actually see the changes in his face and mannerisms and there are also some nice atmospheric scenes at the end.
Those are the two main elements when it comes to this horror series directed by Don Coscarelli.
At first his brother Jody (Bill Thornbury) doesn't believe him, but when Mike shows him a cut-off finger surrounded by 'yellow blood' in a little wooden box he had saved as proof, Jody starts to believe him.
Probably the funniest scenes involved the crazy roommate, such as when he pulls out a gun and starts shooting at the police during a high speed chase, "They hate it when you do this".
It takes a while to get going (nothing much happens in the first half hour), but when it does there's scarcely a letup.
Just as an aside.......... Now that smoking is banned in places of work in England, they won't be able to smoke when making the programme.
He does escape and finally gets his big brother to believe him when he says that things aren't quite right up at the Morningside Cemetery.
Words like haunting, eerie, creepy and forbidding all come to mind when you hear the score.
The underlying theme in this film is the unsolved questions that plague many of us when we wonder what happens when you die.
One of the most harrowing yet well done plot pieces is when Mikey goes to the girl's house and finds an old picture of the Tall Man sitting on a horse carriage, looking like it is circa 1776.
That is why I asked for my money back when I took this P.O.S back to the video store.
But in other scenes, such as when a woman throws a tree limb at it, the car appears hopelessly natural and real.
I had forgotten that Penny Marshall directed it and when it ended and her name was up there I was surprised and even more disappointed.
Its not the worst movie i've ever seen, but it comes real close to it...the stunts are OK, but you just keep wondering why the hell is nobody shooting their gun at the freakin'"class 4" when he's right in front of them, being surrounded by 5 people!!
No emotions, and when there are, they are misplaced.
That doesn't help at all when you can't figure out what the story line.
), the forced tragic features of the plot...without mentioning the last sequence of the film, when Caro thinks he's the new Kubric.
I was entertained endlessly by pat and his adventures when I was a young lad.
What a disappointment , I'm not a genius but i know a good movie when i see it and I'm afraid this was poor .
I did always like the movie box when i was a child though, because you could switch it from the picture of the little boy to the fake cupboard door, and i got a key with it.
The music was just moderate and odd, though with one exception you'll know when you hear it.
I first read the book, The Indian in the Cupboard with my Reading Class when I was in sixth grade, and I enjoyed it.
But when I saw it, I almost fell asleep, I thought that it was really boring!
I thought that it was nothing like the book, I thought that it was totally boring, that you will want to fall asleep when you watch it.
Franco didn't want her, Power didn't seem to care either way (he said she rarely even knew when the camera was rolling; basically, she'd have a hard time even playing convincing furniture) and to things even better, Romina's Mom tagged along.
This is a sad fact since it was nominated for an award at the time it was released but failed to receive that award when the truth came out.
Spadaccini had the balls to pack several different genres into one movie (when's the last time you saw a gay love story morph into a slasher movie?)
Over a hundred years ago the local residents were drowned when a dam was built to create Rushford Lake.
Written and directed by Jay Woelfel, GHOST LAKE is mildly eerie...especially when fog covers the lake.
And then at the end of the movie we have Stan (love interest guy) saying that the little girl was the thirteenth victim, when the lead girl was supposed to be?
He was a Hitch-hiker when do hugs come into it.
When she drove away to go home the scene was exactly the same as the one when she was travelling in the opposite direction.
It's a very simple typical kind of movie score, that is too prominently present at times when nothing is happening in the movie and not present at all- or not good enough at the tense or scary moments of the movie.
The result however isn't much good, since it makes the movie unnecessarily difficult to follow, especially toward the end, when twists and false twists follow each other rapidly.
Let's say that we didn't notice the make-up that is supposed to make the actors look like zombies but instead makes them look like they dropped buckets of various paint over their heads, or when water came out the "zombies'" mouths like when you put water in your mouth and talk - you know, like when you were in kindergarten.
I don't think even Jay Woelfel really knew what the explanatory mathematics at the end meant, and our poor Tatum and her twins looked just like a teenager pretending to understand when being presented with the Theory of Relativity - "Ah, so THAT'S what's happening!
And i'm not even talking about the laughable way Woelfel is cutting the memories into her driving, or the humorous "Days of our Lives"-wannabe expressions on Tatums face when she tries to act on the cuts, either.
I was rewarded for my 90mins of agonising pain when she did it again towards the end.
The cover image of the DVD looked good but when i finished the film i realised that quote; "never judge a book by its cover" is true  To be honest, i got half an hour in and skipped through the rest.
Back to my true subject, Halo 2 is greatly overrated when compared to the TRUE ultimate game... SUPER MARIO BROTHERS!
There are about 20 people living there and about 65 % of that population dies when a big, angry man ( Aldo Ray ) comes to town to raise a little hell.
Residents of a lawless, three-horse town in the Old West are paralyzed with fear after psychopathic stranger Aldo Ray arrives and starts shooting people and setting fires; time passes, and lawyer turned mayor Henry Fonda helps rebuild what's left of the community, but when Ray returns, Fonda has to confront his own fear and morality.
A brutal western morality tale starring Henry Fonda as the "mayor" of a tiny frontier town whose courage is tested when deranged outlaw Aldo Ray runs rampant burning buildings, raping saloon girl Janice Rule and killing anyone who stands up to him.
One plot gimmick after another is thrown in, evidently just to fill up some screen time, when more time might have been spent developing the characters of the townspeople.
This movie was produced in the 60s and bears the stamp of those times, times when the inmates tried to run the asylum--and very nearly succeeded.
The town is almost deserted, but when a saloon manager, along with his group of prostitutes settles in the town to serve the miners from the surrounding mountains, there is hope once again.
In fact, Blue is so little of a hero that he doesn't even succeeds to gain redemption when the villain returns.
Wonderfully daft piece of movie-making that actually grows worse with age, "Welcome to Hard Times" is a presumably honest description of the feeling author E L Doctorow experienced when viewing the Burt Kennedy screen version of his work.
The film has no realism what-so-ever; when the father of the raped girl goes to save her he goes WITHOUT A GUN (he's carrying a piece of wood)!
And now comes the mother of all dumb "highlights": the Irish woman stares at the dead "bad man" when - suddenly - he opens his eyes (he wasn't dead - the name is Jason Michael Myers) and grabs her hand violently.
Until he shows up again... And when he shows up again don't get mad and - for chrissakes - DON'T go for the gun because, honestly, it won't solve anything, it won't bring back the dead, and it won't eradicate all the other "bad men" roaming around in this tough world.
There's very little coherence until the climactic fire, when the Stooges save the day.
Ted Healy was a major star in vaudeville and film when this movie was made.
Having taped this movie from AMC's Third Annual Film Preservation Festival when the subject was comedy, I was very anxious to see the film debut of The Three Stooges with Ted Healy as their original leader and Shemp Howard in the original group before quitting, allowing younger brother Curly to take his place.
Written by cartoonist Rube Goldberg, who makes a cameo here, the story-about an elderly costume store owner (Charles Winninger) about to lose his place-is nothing special but has some amusing visual humor when we see some of Winninger's inventions like the complicated ways to wake up and stop a robber involving a cat and a giant boot.
As for the Stooges, they play firemen who Ted hangs around with when he's not constantly arguing with his girlfriend (Frances McCoy).
The film does at least pick up some energy when he is screen.
And when it thankfully finished I was left with a feeling of "So What?".
The fact this film was backed when so many others are struggling to find finance is another nail in the coffin of the British film Industry.
It doesn't help when Thomas the Tank Engine (Edward Glen) and friends are being attacked by the nasty Diesel 10 (Neil Crone), who also wants to find the missing train Lady (Allcroft) and the Magic Railroad it runs on.
Maybe if I had seen this when it first came out I would have loved it, but today, it's just dull and stupid.
And in marked contrast with other reviewers I find silence just a bit boring when overdone.
The Great Depression made film studios reluctant to make long-term contracts with actors, and when they did, they substantially reduced the salaries paid.
There are French directors who dare:FranÃ§ois Ozon is one of them ,and even when he pushes his art to extreme limits (les amants criminels),both his screenplay ,his directing and his mastery remain powerful.
Unbelievable  Of course there are some good things about this movie, especially how the two families are brought into screen and how one family falls apart when someone from the other family comes to live with them.
The best part of the whole thing was when he thought up the genius idea that cartoons are brainwashing the youth of America and then showed a clip from the buzzlight year cartoon, of buzz getting an eye scan for ordering a pizza...absolutly hilarious!
when i saw peter Jacksons "forgotten silver", i knew how easy it is to foul people.
I even felt a twinge if sadness when he got murdered.
She also has an acquaintance from way back when pitch in.
In XANADU, she only looks glamorous in this film when she's dressed in the army gear for her number with Gene Kelly, when she's in the chorus line with the other muses, or when she's dressed as the rock diva.
Also, Wilfred Hyde-White, as Zeus, sounds like he's half-asleep when he's delivering his lines (maybe he realized how bad this movie was).
What drugs were they on when they made this disaster?
Then there's the whole 1940s - glam rock melding scene, when we actually hear Olivia's voice on the soundtrack during the 1940s scenes but then, whoa, Olivia is nowhere to be seen.
The whole "Suddenly" moment, when Olivia and Michael rollerskate inside the "magical" studio.
And the whole ending, when Olivia sings on screen (which makes you go "wow, it's a musical now") but it's just a medley of pointless tunes sandwiched in between a truncated version of the song Xanadu.
I saw it in the theatre way back when.
The girl, who is a curiously talented gymnast and ice-skater, cripples her mother, kills a couple of teenagers, uses foul language when yelling at both Shelley Winters and Glenn Ford and keeps an attack eagle as a pet.
And I got a feeling of nostalgia when I saw they kept the same woman from the Shining Time Station series.
The best of it was, when she had the shirt around her hair.
We bought this disaster movie on video for our daughter when she was only two and "into" Thomas and Co. She loved it.
plus you know when she invites him in the house and puts on true colors they are going to have a really unnecessary sex scene.
When Derek is asked if he'll help his friend to take revenge it's obvious someone is going to get hurt when that happens and it's more likely to be Derek, the smart black guy who wants to be a Doctor.
Oh, and bull-crap way Mordecai's car blew up when it got shot?
And oh yes, the programme makers seem to think that the parents of Hindley and Brady's victims are also boors, since the only time we ever hear a peep out of them is when they talk about wanting to kill Hindley and Brady for revenge.
At one point, when Longford is being heckled for his support of Myra, he shoots a breaking-the-fourth-wall glance to camera, as if to say, 'can you believe these people!'
You can just see Longford jumping for joy inside when his wife 'sees the light', so to speak.
He is drinking too much whiskey due to his guilty complex since he had a love affair with a woman when Carol left home, and he has frequent blackouts, forgetting what he has done in the previous drinking night.
I was bait-and-switched into watching this waste of electrons when I attended a showing of "Brainjacked", a full length movie from the same creative cadre (which turned out be pretty good).
Synchronizing your actor's voices to match what they were saying when filming and the emotions they were feeling is not hard.
Archaeologist Anna (Gina Philips) is keen to find out what is on the inside, but when the site is declared to be a bio-hazard, she is prevented from continuing her dig.
I was hopeful when I read the description on Netflix.
Otherwise:  *** ******** ************ SPOILERS ************* *********  Want something you can barely see, even when you use the undark special feature on your DVD remote?
My middle son and I watched this film over and over and over when he was about 3.
Granted, when doing the movie, the writer and the directors were facing some challenges.
After I, and II Gene Hackman and Margot Kidder were openly angry at the Producers Ilya and Alexander Salkind for firing Richard Donner off the 2nd movie, he had filmed the 1st film, and most of the 2nd when this happened.
There are some redeeming qualities which saves this movie from being as awful as "Superman IV": the Rube Goldberg-esque sequence in the beginning of the film (where one mishap causes another & things get worse); the charming courtship between Lana & Clark (for a change, Lana really likes Clark but doesn't care much for Superman); and when Superman's evil twin starts doing naughty things like flick peanuts at windows to break them, or straighten the Tower of Pisa, I think he even comes on to Lana!
It's no secret that the Salkinds originally intended the SUPERMAN films to be camp comedies, a plan that Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewicz undid when they made SUPERMAN as a dramatic film.
Even when Superman ISN'T evil (and the "Superman goes evil and fights himself" scene is the lowest point in the film), Christopher Reeve comes off as smarmy and insincere (probably because he realizes the film sucks).
But when Superman interferes with that, they decide to throw some kryptonite at him, but it fails, but turns Superman into a bad guy!
Since when was Superman a comedy and not an action/drama?
when i saw this for the first time i was more of a kid than now......a little kid and i was a big superman movies fan.....i even liked this one a bit....and when i see it right now i still enjoy some of it....it is enjoyable to see superman turn evil....it is the best part of the movie....or maybe the only good part of it......richard pryor is too dumb at some parts of the movie and the opening credits belong to a Charles Chaplin movie.....a bad Charles Chaplin movie........the musical score is not bad.....mostly because it is filled mainly with John Williams' music but still it could've been much better........the only excellent thing in this film is Christopher Reeve's performance......but the rest is disappointing....specially when the big computer battles superman....disappointing but certainly better than the fourth superman movie........** out of 5
Well, we all got our answer in 1983, when Superman III debuted, this completely under the guiding hand of Richard Lester.
Why didn't Superman freeze the acid when he was talking to the scientist.
(like he was taught it when he was taught DP).
And Gus would have smashed right through the window he landed on when he fell down the building.
Superman blowing out the Olympic flame is no big deal, it could easily be re-lit when he left.
Am I the only one who thought the tanker should explode when Superman is welding the side closed?
And how DO the Websters balloons stay inflated when they have no heat source inflating them?
), a dim-witted computer programmer who becomes involved in crime when he begins working for millionaire Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn).
The other half of the film revolves around Superman (Christopher Reeve), as he is reunited with high school sweetheart Lana Lang (Annette O'Toole) and becomes evil when exposed to synthetic kryptonite.
One can't help but wonder what David and Leslie Newman, who co-wrote the previous two SUPERMAN films, were thinking when they wrote this film.
He is without a doubt one of the greatest actors of all time, but what was he thinking when he made this movie.
If this is parody, then critics aren't lying when they classify it as the laziest genre.
If you want to learn what NOT to do when making a horror film, then watch "Stacy."
I wrote a horrible parody of film noir when I was taking a screenwriting class.
My brother used to love Thomas when he was younger, and he is 3 years younger than me.
This movie came out when he was 5, and I saw it for the first time in years, and I wish I never did.
The gore will keep your attention for maybe 10 minutes at the most before you keep checking your watch wondering when this mis-fire will finally end.
But i really should see it coming when it starts and you see Dean Cain running.
at least i thought so.it's a magical fantasy adventure which for about 86 minutes should make you forget about you problems.and most kids should eat it up.there's certainly nothing objectionable here.while i was viewing it,it kept m,y attention and sort of brought me back to the days when i was a kid.this show wasn't around back then of course.all we had were Saturday morning cartoons.but if you try and view this with a child's perspective,you might appreciate it more.and if you do drift off,at least the young ones are watching something that won't pollute their minds.for entertainment aimed at children,you really can't go wrong with this movie.from that perspective,it's a 10/10
I didn't want to watch This movie when I saw it listed.
I was still waiting for an explanation when the credits rolled.
The direction and editing are sometimes stunningly inept, resulting in several great "WTF moments," including my favorite when a character is hanging off the outside door of a moving jeep, for seemingly no reason.
The story begins with a car chase when two aliens fire their machine guns against Rykker but never hit the hero; suddenly one of them wisely jumps on Rykker car to struggle against the hero in a ridiculous sequence.
I have this film at my house and i paid $10 for it about 13 years agon when i was 5 cuase i liked king kong and stuff right so i thought hey looks good.
when I got home and put it in i couldn't watch more then 5 minutes of it.
There are too many mistakes to list, so i won't even attempt to, all I want to know is if the film makers were serious when they made this movie.
At one point when the Ape was stomping a village by a mountain, the Ape was wearing high top tennis shoes.
His intentions are totally misunderstood when he carts her away to his mountain hideaway.
i seen this poor done comic film.but it would been better if they used a family that wasn't based on nothing.the movie starts as Denise finds a dinosaur bone in his back yard,and a fake  who claims to be a dinosaur hunter comes to stay with the family.and he is real annoying too.the film did not deliver much laughs.the only two funny things in the movie was when Denise tries to sneak that fudge candy to his room and the scene where Mr Wilson's washer overflowed.it would be a better film if it involved a different character.the 93 version was a real one.this one wasn't a Denise the menace at all.
and i saw this one 2 or 3 times a month when it was on HBO.
He'd done it one hundred times before and he didn't think anything was unusual when the driver struck up conversation.
I had high hopes for it when I heard that it was being made back in 2001 because I read "The Devil and Daniel Webster" when I was a kid and I found it very interesting.
The only good part of the movie was the ending, and I mean the ENDING like when the credits were all done.
Well in STILETTO DANCE when people aren`t getting blown away or getting limbs chopped off the characters often seem to revert to ridiculous amounts of swearing .
And when I say blows, I mean BA-LOWS!
I mean, they actually stage the scene in an all white room just so the blood will show up better when splattered on the walls!
The best part of the movie was the last 10 minutes, when cheerleading actually took place.
I was pretty annoyed when I saw all those bad reviews, so it took me a little to calm down, as you can see by how my writing has changed from angry to nice and calm.
Anne Judson-Yager|Whittier| is supposed to be our heroine,our darling so to speak,yet she's almost as whiny and disposable as Tina and Marni,so how on earth is a sequel gonna work like this,when there is no one to root for?.
But I already had my doubts when there were different actresses and all.
And i know i'm speaking for a lot of people when i say this movie is horrible and should never be played on t.v for the rest of eternity.
The only real plus is when the 2 girls break off and form their own squad filled with those dormitory protesters.
Both my son's are avid Thomas the Tank Engine fans and we purchased this film about 4 years ago when the oldest hit the 'Thomas is everything' stage.
I don't know what the writer was thinking, or what the producers were doing when they greenlighted this trash, but it is one of the most boring 2 hours in cinematic history.
Don't even bother renting it when it comes out on video.
A particularly endearing moment was when Al tells the camera, `I thought this would last forever,' after describing a romantic moment shared by the couple.
However, all of the potential of this movie was shattered when all of a sudden, in a moment of 90210 like melodrama, Imogen thinks she's pregnant.
Freddie ("She's All That") Prinze Jr., and Julia ("10 Things I Hate About You") Stiles are attending a New York City college when they discover each other one night in a trendy bar and experience love at first sight.
Not long after Imogen (Stiles) and Al (Prinze) shack up, the anxieties of living together take a toll on the 'tingles' of the true love that they felt when they first met.
Their relationship runs aground when Imogen fears that she is pregnant.
Later, they split up when Imogen has a one-night stand with another student that resembles late legendary musician Jim Morrison.
You know a movie is in trouble when the supporting characters are more interesting than the protagonists.
The second best scene occurs when Al dreams about being a guest on a macho male talk show segment where tough guys ridicule his sensitive man routine.
This is the closest thing to genuine comedy that Iascsson comes up with here, especially when one of the guys warns Al "to cross your legs because your panties are showing."
She steps out on Al, and he throws a tantrum when she tells himself about her infidelity.
when I was little I use 2 always watch this.
It's really weird 2 look back on all the things that scared u when u were younger, and look at them now.
The toys LOOK like they have a hand in them controlling their movements and actions, and you can clearly see the cord attached to the delivery boy when he is "thrown" back by the goofy-looking bear-toy-monster.
The gore is tame & unconvincing apart from a reasonable decapitation, there are a few bites, a few gunshot wounds, a scene when someone pokes his own eyes out, someone is poked in the eye & someone has their fingers bitten off.
I liked this movie and it gave me the "heebie-jeebies" when I first saw it.
He falls in love with Ann Miller (who looks young enough to be his daughter) but when she becomes engaged to Kenny Baker, he develops insomnia.
So comes the very boring, unfunny part of the film when Milton Berle and Jack Oakie try, by different means to get him to sleep.
I thought this movie was good at the point when i hadn't read the book, but after i read the book, i thought is was a failure.
I dislike it because when it came out, the production team and every newspaper and article claimed that this movie was made absolutely faithful to the book.
):  An archaeologist (Christopher McDonald) has returning nightmares about his childhood when his family was killed.
Once there, he get's obsessed with finding the entrance to the tomb and slowly goes insane when his imaginary friend appears again....  *******SPOILER*********  Turns out he killed his family out of revenge (and being under the influence of his imaginary friend) for being locked up in the "playroom" by his father.
My top 10 Problems with this movie...  1 Peter Fonda looked like he was on 'ludes the whole movie... especially when his missing granddaughter turns up and he blurts "lily.
5 What exactly are the rules about who shrinks and who doesn't when they travel thru the magic railroad.
And when they are, some speak with a brit accent and others don't.
Jake seems rather uninterested when he is informed that Muslim extremists in the north of Thailand have kidnapped his daughter, but that's only a cover for his apparent unlimited rage, at least according to the tag line.
Some suggest Seagal was dubbed in that scene, but I always suspected that Stevie was the romantic type (at least when talking to monks).
And you never see Steven's face when these are performed..........................
The wire action becomes ridiculous, especially when you are trying to make a somewhat realistic action movie (imagine what one would think if Tony Jaa jumped 10 feet straight in the air and did 2 full revolutions).
The only thing I hated was the movie was more about homophobia and gay bashing.Not that I support Nazi skinheads but I don't understand why they were so threatened by gays instead of the groups of black and Asian gangs in the neighborhood.There was an interesting remark made in the DVD extra features that mentions that there is more violence within their own ranks then there is violence towards others.I loved the scene in the movie when a huge group of gay men got together and bashed the skinheads back.I have never seen that before in a movie and they deserved the beating.It was nice to see a bit of payback from the gay community.Ironically the most vicious gay hating skinhead David Lee played by David Lee Willson has come out as a gay man in real life.I read a really cool article about this actor and how hard it was for him to play such an evil hateful role.
...I remember seeing this on TV at some point when I was younger and thinking it wasn't bad,but Id only watched it from halfway through so when I found it on IMDb,I decided to purchase it.Mistake.This film,admittedly low-budget,is just too amateur and low-brow, making you feel that half the time the director has forgotten which way he wants the film to go.
You don't know who...when...where...why.
But when looked at in the "trash film" context, then this one becomes at least entertaining.
But lets face it; there are so few films made about the punk and skinhead scene, that when something comes along, we just have to see it.
You have to admit, this trash film does deliver the goods when it comes to violence.
But when the camera reaches these sickos, they talk about how young boy's bodies are the most perfect ever.
However, Marina and Lola don't get on and are forever trading insults and then tragedy strikes when local girl Heather Babcock (MAUREEN BENNETT) dies after drinking a cocktail laced with poison.
But director Guy Hamilton is more interested in having his cast offer star turns than in actually serving the story, and the result is a strangely uneven, extremely plodding film that only comes to life when Taylor and Novak square off in the series of hilariously written and performed cat-fights that run throughout the movie.
But it's when the plot creaks and flops into Paris, in what passes for a 3rd act attending - ahem - "Fashion Week" that this movie just falls apart.
This movie generated so much buzz when it came out that I initially resisted seeing it.
In this movie, women are obsessed with their exteriors in the mirror and with a bunch of goofy-looking clothes which, when they see themselves photographed in them fifteen years down the road will look as ludicrous as disco fashions look to us.
There's no mention as to why supplies would dwindle to nothing when it's the only thing holding Sodor together - Mr.
Why would they think the main character would be even remotely sympathetic to us all when she displayed her disdain for the "evil, vain" fashion publishing industry buy quitting to get away from all the phonies, only to take a job with a phony left-wing fraudulent "newspaper" where she supposed she could "do real work?"
In the real world, partners go through periods when they become absorbed by intense spells and relationships survive, because in good relationships partners support the long-term goals of their sig others.
The gratuitous fashion montages were fantastic, but Anne Hathaway is a less than formidable talent that works best when she's posing all Brunette Barbie style.
I enjoy Hamill in other films; but I guess when directing himself, he's not able to guide himself into a plausible character.
Where's Homeland Security when you need them?
But it's obvious that the makers of "SFI" spectacularly misjudged the drawing power of the airport setting in generating viewer interest, especially when they made the airport and everything in it muddy orange and brown.
You know a film is in trouble when one of the few Oscar winners of recent years who has not irrevocably damaged the credibility of the awards cannot save it.
I'm not a big fan of guns, but I am less of a fan when it comes to stereotyping and one-sidedness.
In fact, when Pete (the bad guy) joins the bad gang, he changes his last name to a Mexican name for no apparent reason.
The ButterCream Gang (the good gang) mowe people's lawns for no money, save "the Widow Jenkins" (not Mrs. Jenkins, Widow Jenkins; they have to remind her that her husband is dead every time they say her name) when she falls down, and, of course, attend regular church services.
Only 3 or 4 real "trouble-makers" (probably just egged a house, or stayed up past curfew) it has no meaning, and when i saw it, i was part of its target group, that was 2.5 years ago, thats how bad the suckiness of this movie stuck in my head.
I saw the Buttercream gang when I was sixteen,my brothers and I popped it in our VHS Player and sat back to watch it.We ended up making snide comments the whole time.I'm a Christain and love good quality movies,but this thing was so cheesy and happy sappy I think I got a cavity from watching it.They try to overdramatise the serious parts.
I came to this site to prove a point to people because these kids in my home town recently decided to start their own "gang" call "The Butter Creamers" i almost died laughing when i heard this.
My favorite scene was when the old woman fell down and needed help.
This is not the video nastie, but only because it came out in 1994 when they were presumably tired of the whole thing in Britain.
And when i say nothing i perfectly describe the end of the film.
Yes, when a plane gets blown up by a rocket, the entire sequence takes place off camera, saving the FX dept their whole budget.
But when they have the power of the camera's eye which allows them to use angles, editing, etc.
Any stupid flick, even a pretentious one, is more forgivable when it's short.
I've seen hundreds and hundreds of awful movies, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that probably 90-95% of them clock in within ten minutes of the ninety minute mark.
Of course the big excuse for Cameron's presence here is that he was very much unknown when he worked on "Galaxy of Terror".
Conclusion: get really wasted and watch this, you might get into the whole psychedelic mood that the actors and director must have been when shooting the movie.
Story revolves around a rescue mission going terribly wrong when people mysteriously start dying off.
Chuck Jones's 'There They Go-Go-Go', the ninth Road Runner cartoon, is the inevitable moment when this excellent series finally hits a snag.
Many people, when they think of the Road Runner shorts imagine a repetitive and not especially funny set of predictable gags.
But when some dastardly fellows take over a space-ship to enforce a gold deal, some fellows called the Space Marines are called in to sort them out.
Donald Duck is out by himself, skating on his pond having a good time when his three little kids come racing out onto the surface, ready to play hockey.
Unfortunately, it lost its spark in many ways... (Spoiler Alert) It all started when they decided to make Robin become obsessed with the big baddie of the show - Slade.
Then, she tries to kill them all, and gets upset when they come back for revenge.
You may likely feel glad when the film is over, because you don't have to witness the wretched suffering of the addict characters anymore.
It's got occassional good moments, as when Ichi explains how she wound up in her fight or Isaburo running towards the riflemen through the vegetation, but the pacing is glacial and the story is somewhat interesting but not nearly interesting enough to support over two hours of movie.
The dialogue is downright horrible(except when taken from Camus exactly).
Bullets are cheaper and provide the same feeling when put into heart.
This is another one of those movies shot on video with a nice looking DVD box that gives the impression it's actually a film, when in reality it looks like it was shot on super 8 video by the neighborhood kids.
Like when they find the body that hasn't decomposed like it you'd think it would have having been buried in a 120 year old cemetery, the police would be called since it was obviously just buried.
My favorite part of the movie is when the girl asks the Sheriff "why don't you just run them over?"
We just don't have the budget for it"   But the thing that bugs me the most about garbage like this, is when you see comments in the IMDb where the people are praising this obviously awful movie.
(I also cringe when I see 10 stars for this movie as they are obviously affiliated in some way) A film is either good or bad no matter how big or small the budget.
Te Wheke himself is driven mad by his vengeance against his former employer (the military), when he came across the destruction of a Maori village at the beginning of the film.
Return of the Boogyman is a dreadful movie which doesn't play like a movie, it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they flashback to older episodes.
The people in the cinema cheered when it was over, but not because they liked the movie, just because it was over...
First one is in the beginning when one of the rich men gets arrested.
The second one is when the female judge finds out that someone destroyed her office, but you don't know who did it, nor why he or she did it.
This company's research department missed the boat when it comes to certain actual events and even, in one episode, makes mention of a mouthwash product that didn't "make the scene" until the mid-'60s.
Also, whatever moron patched together this turd didn't even bother to watch the first film, because they kept calling Suzanna Love's character Natalie, when it's Lacey.
Compare this to the meaningless gore in "Desperado", when characters are introduced and then killed off without the slightest reason.
The movie had soul, if only because Rodriguez quite obviously thought of himself as a Mariachi of sorts when he wrote the script.
But I left this movie after seeing the scene after the sex scene, where the Moco clone somehow managed to find out, with nothing but Selma Hyak's strange performance when he gets to her bookstore, that El Mariachi is in the book store being hidden by her character.
Almost as if he assumed that we wouldn't see El Mariachi, even though Columbia, according to Robert Rodriguez' diaries in Rebel Without a Crew, said they'd package both movies together when they were negotiating for the rights.
Seemed like it was almost robotic to me when he drove off into the sunset.
He only runs out of ammo when the script is setting him up for predictable scene.
This is not my monster of choice to begin with, but barring that fact I know a bad flick when I see one.
Many times when there's a good deal of activity on screen, the camera work is such that you can't see much of anything going on.
Why is it that when you could MAYBE understand what one of them was saying, the volume dropped so low that it wouldn't matter anyway.
For example, when they decide they all need to go downstairs for some ceremony, I'd add, "Now, we all need to do the hokey pokey."
....I should have paid attention to the sinking feeling in the pit of my gut when in the beginning of the film we are set in Marin, California.....MARIN?!??!!
The highlight of this film comes when the mummy that the story revolves around is being depicted .
The camera pans down the arm of the cloth-wrapped creature and when it focuses on the hand, one notices that something doesn't seem quite right.
And more importantly what kind of weed was the writer and director smoking when making this awful POS??!!!
would be 20 years old since she was 5 when that happened and not only is she married to someone who looks 30ish but also has a kid who looks around 7 and 10!
And a BIG HUGE MOVIE MISTAKE I found in this movie is that when the doctor is writing in his notebook does anyone notice that he's just SCRIBBLING?
I remembered when this movie came out back in the late 90's.
I never paid much attention to it, but when I saw it was going to be on HBO, I DVRed it.
I remember seeing this movie in 1986 when WFLD TV-32 in Chicago was broadcasting the final episode of its old-school horror-movie program, THE SON OF SVENGOOLIE, hosted by Rich Koz.
He abuses his powers to go out and steal booze to go on a date and when he breaks out of a death trap in the open ocean, he flies in circles around his enemies for minutes just to toy with them.
Supersonic (for that is his name) is sleeping in a spaceship when an intergalactic voice tells him an evil mastermind wants to kidnap a professor so he, the evil mastermind, can rule over the world.
Just when it looks like her car is going to hit a bulldozer, Supersonic lifts it up with one hand.
One has to admire those academics, if not for their vocabulary, then for the fact that he doesn't start laughing when the giant and fierce (and frankly slow) robot appears.
Well, that's not entirely true as I had seen her hardcore/horror hybrid COME WITH ME, MY LOVE back in the day when the lady still vehemently denied any involvement in the explicit side of the sex film industry.
Of all the excessively nonsensical, rancid and imbecilic Sexploitation movies ever made during the decade of the 1970's (and genre buffs know there are a LOT of them), Doris Wishman's "The Amazing Transplant" definitely takes the cake when talking in terms of pure senselessness and sheer incoherence.
He displays the weirdest facial expressions when astonished, makes offensive remarks towards lesbians and simply walks away when women clearly need emotional support.
I hate it when these no name, small time DVD companies take these long forgotten 'before they were famous' films made God knows how long ago and give them snazzy, glossy new covers to make them look like they're new and trendy films, as was the case here.
Arnold's acting debut came in a period in his life when I guess bodybuilding was his main interest.
Bad acting from one person only doesn't necessary make a movie a total disaster, but when just EVERYTHING ELSE also are as horrible as they can be, then we have a movie that never should've been made.
Now, there can be no real doubt when you watch this movie that it is absolutely awful.
But when you consider that this movie should have a score of one you know that those additional points are on comedic merit alone.
I guess the reason I find it so funny is it reminds me of the half assed films me and my friends have done bored when nobody can act and lines seem stupid.
But when he talks,when he's trying to be humorous...Aaaarrrrrgggggghhhhhh!
The highlight of the film is definitely when Hercules (Arnie) dukes it out with a "600 pound Grizzly bear".
Oh and when a god that can fly chooses to ride in a helicopter, classic!
See thats surprising when you watch this movie!
For example, when Hercules fights a bear, there is no attempt to make the bear look even slightly real; it's all-too-obviously a man in a bear suit.
Then we have main supporting character Arnold Stang, an actor which has exactly two different looks: one of utter confusion, probably because he's wondering about what the hell he's doing in the movie in the first place and one look of not so utter confusion, which he often uses when Hercules flexes his muscles for him.
Secondly, when Cuneta paid her fees in the jeepney, nobody attempted to help her pass on the money to the driver.
Worth a look for the light,sun-kissed sex content and not much more,which,when you consider the movie poster,the title and the plot summary is probably all that it intends to be.
Like the man said if you're gonna steal steal from the best and Abraham Polonsky surely took this to heart when he lifted Golden Boy right out of Cliff Odets' typewriter and added just enough spin to get away with it.
So it's not even good as a crazy tourist or event video, even if it may show how stupid boys may act when they are drunk... As the long belly diving scene...
One part of the movie that especially comes to mind when say "a waste of two hours" is a scene where the drumline section leader walks up to the drummers one at a time and plays on their drum with them walking forward.
I nearly cried when i saw Ebert gave it 3 stars out of four.
In the scene when Adam's wrists are cut, why do you hear the blood dropping only when the camera moves down?
And can anybody explain why almost the only time Vick wears a hat is when he's indoors?
My wife and I couldn't stop laughing when it did.
He tries use him at first to get stuff, like good grades, and when the alien fails the alien is tortured, beaten, and thrown in the trash.
Want to know why China is one of the worst offenders when it comes to animal cruelty?
It is painful to watch the dog (alien or not) to be abused by everyone until the end, when the dog sacrifices it's own life to the elder of the family (the father).
You see the cyphers are terribly underwritten so I`ll be kind when I say the actors do their best with non existent material though by a cruel irony we see Jack Palance ( An actor at his very best when saying nothing ) getting far too much in the way of ludicurous lines   There is one aspect to the film that does deserve serious criticism and that`s the editing .
I could give several other examples of this inept editing   As for the music , disco was popular when this movie was made in 1980 so I guess that`s why it was composed to go with this movie .
You also have to wonder what the cast and crew thought when they sat down to watch the post-production cut of this movie.
Keep it under your bed like it was a porn flick and get it out (so to speak) when your mates come around for a kitsch early 80s revival night.
Drink lots of beer (you'll need it when you see the size of Pallance's weapon), slide into a pair of fake leather trousers and press play.
Indeed, when Hawk addresses Patricia Quinn as "Woman" Â as in "Woman, we need the use of your magic" Â you half expect her to reply "I'm a man.
The only worth while line is from the Protagonist when he finally catches up to his clone..... "Get in there Xerox."
I only became aware of it when I checked into imdb to see the reviews for the recent remake and was directed to check out the original which was at the library.
Four young men and three young women, party, have sex, and then become embroiled in a deathfest when one of the girls dies during a sex act.The acting is fairly good, the characters are fine and the girls, Sian Breckin,Nichola Burley and Jaime Winston (daughter of Ray) look good and are a teenage boys dream, well "up for it".
Unfortunately, matters take a more serious turn when Lisa is killed during a sex game that goes wrong.
Yes, it's a thriller but when there are seven people on a boat you pretty much know from the beginning that there's going to be a last man standing.
But you may easily be disappointed, if you see Jessica Lange's performance here, whom I had so much respect for (well, there are few moments when she actually is believable, but most of the time she's just too fake, would-be cool and high above), and even worse, Diane Keaton's pathetic and unbelievable acting.
The story revolves around three troubled sisters in a Southern town, who reunite when the youngest, Babe (rather a bizarre character), gets herself in a jam after shooting her husband.
Otherwise, I'll stick to the Steel Magnolias type when I feel like a movie interweaving the tales of a group of women.
While he can be funny when he just talks off the cuff on TV, in films he has a very strong propensity to appear in ANYTHING...as long as it's bad.
i'm demanding my rental fee be waived on principle when i sheepishly have to walk this turkey of all turkeys in.
With early comparisons to "American Pie" and "Road Trip," I wasn't expecting much when I saw SURF SCHOOL this past week.
Apparently one of the ways you can choose to die when you're sentenced to death is to watch this movie.
This situation is maintained for 10 years, when a woman of dubious character turns up and claims refuge.
Back when HALLOWEEN 4 was released on DVD in 2001, it was somewhat of a new thing.
Turner seems to possess only three facial expressions, even when trying to stay upright in her stilettos as she totters round 'St.
I gave up on this channel a long time ago but still see pieces of shows when I flip by and they are all terrible except for the reruns which they can't really take credit for.
The stories and 'real live guests' are all so scripted and fake that it is hard to believe all of it is so completely unfunny, when you are making it all up and control everything how can none of it be funny?
It is so bad watching untalented "comedians" try to be funny when they so obviously are not.
When you watch a film like Kuch Naa Kaho, you are reminded that when it comes to cowardice, Bollywood artists are pretty much on the top.
But when it comes to character portrayal, she wouldn't know where to begin because neither her nor the script are interested in it.
The only sensible moment is when Raj fells for Namrata, cause who would not fell for Ash?
And when the guy finally agrees to leave her alone - well the ending is just horribly stupid.
Nothing has changed between the moment he's sure to stay and when he decides to leave.
The first thing I thought of was when Tommy Lee Jones's character went to the American Embassy and he saw the holes in the wall on the outside of the building.
Too much details of the spilled blood when bullets hit the poor soldiers in Vietnam.
Where Odets dealt in stereotypes, Polonsky and everyone else on the film treat the supporting characters with dignity and respect: at a time when Stepinfetchit was the image of big screen black America, Canada Lee's performance as the former champ is a revelation Â he may not have much screen time, but he's one of the most clued-in characters in the piece, with a dignity and intelligence all but unheard of for a black character in the 40s.
Remember it's when people become indifferent that bad things happen , not when they join a political party .
This is often a problem with a great number of movies featuring anti semitism 1933-45 in that by showing us mans inhumanity to man they often feel the need to labour the point home of the cruelty of the regime and the victims fear when in fact less would been more .
It could also be that this is always not a very good subject to base a movie around especially when there's documentaries like THE WORLD AT WAR that shows the very real horrors of what the Nazis did to their victims
The double exposure effects for when Pickford meets Pickford on screen are seamless.
I watched out for this film to come to my local cinema and was unable to see it when it arrived so was even more excited about watching it on the DVD... but it failed on many levels to excite me, the characters failed to excite, there were far to many sub plots and the stuttering just got on my nerves!
The stutter was endearing at first, then pitiful, then it just got annoying near the end of the movie when it finally dawns on the audience that Nicholas D'Agosto's character doesn't actually help him conquer it.
In a way, the film is a blueprint of how to become a rock star; make music with your friends, film every show, make loud experimental music, use smoke and fire when you lack talent, find a filmmaker to follow you around, crank call record companies, tour , tour , tour and you'll finally make it big.
I had seen many when they were current news, believing it important to see what the enemy (terrorists and radical religious fundamentalists) was all about, but I just couldn't stomach re-watching these cold-blooded, grotesque murders again, presented as they were in the guise of "infotainment", and turned the movie off.
Maybe i had the wrong idea when i watched this movie, i was convinced from start till perhaps the last scene, that i was going to see an inspiring transformation, where i would no longer feel sorry for the kid, and that marred my view on the film.
The stutter was a vehicle to portray a message about love when i went through the whole movie thinking it was the opposite, that all the references to love would make him lose his stutter.
I felt at the end of 'Rocket Science' that the kid was never going to get rid of his stutter, and when did his last debate and he turned to the judges and said 'Im killing it right?'
Cool calculus - this was my first feeling when I saw this very disappointing Chinese film.
Perhaps what was most striking were the heroes who spoke articulately using words of more than two syllables, reaching its acme in 'Streetcar named desire' where Brando's character refers to 'The Napoleonic code' when he rages about his sister-in-law's possessions.
Tell me you didn't laugh when the guy is speed crawling/running through the 10000 bulls.
There's no authenticity and what, when, and where is this story supposed to be taken place?
In fact, why would the enemy even send buffaloes through a canyon in the first place when the entire good guys army is safely positioned on the ridges of the mountain?
OK, you can go now..." I can safely say that best part of "The Promise" is when the credits roll, because you know it is finally over.
Cursed by a fairy when young, the Princess is not to find true love, until impossible conditions are met.
I should have known what to expect when I saw Etchie Stroh's name as one of the producers.
A few years ago, when I was sitting in a bus on my trip from Taipei to Kaohsiung (for those who do not live in Taiwan, it's a 5-hour trip), I turned on the LCD screen in front of me (Yes, that's right, some buses in Taiwan have LCD screens and movies for passengers to chose during the trip) and chose "The Promise" on the select screen.
It hurts my eardrums every time when I hear those ridiculous lines.
After sitting through this pathetic excuse for a film , when the plane actually landed , I was fully expecting to hear the sound of clicking , as the passengers push a large safety bar up in front of them , as some young , teenage boy shouts "please dad , can I go on it again?"
The film is loaded with conflict for Charlie Davis (Garfield) - his mother (Revere) doesn't want him to fight; he's in love with Peg (Palmer) and wants to marry her but is talked into delaying it when he signs on with a new and corrupt promoter, Roberts (Gough).
The sheriff turns out to be working with Dr. Myra and her gang but when he and Morrie & Dotty arrive at the island he has a change of heart.
Well, when they arrive, they find the place is infested with zombies (though because the budget was so low, you only see one--late in the film they inform you that the place is infested with them).
And, when the teens actually take away the baddies' guns, they DON'T shoot them--even when the crooks once again attack them.
Perhaps the boys just liked the "funny feeling" they felt when they wrestled with men....who knows.
With his mother Anna, Anne Revere, being against him boxing Charlie tries to find a new line of employment Later when Charlie's father David, Art Smith, is killed in a bombing of his candy store by some mobsters, who mistook it for a rival speakeasy, and then with no money to pay the bills Charlie decides that boxing is the only way for him and his family to get out of poverty.
Charlie also realizes what a jerk he's turned in now getting his brains beat out in order to enrich a bunch of gangsters who'll use him for as long as he's is still useful to them and when he isn't they'll drop him just like they did Ben.
It's those zombies that no doubt they've seen in several horror flicks when they've gone to drive-ins.
It says here that the film was released in 1959, but when I saw the film the credits clearly said 1957.
The boys heroically sneak away when it's dark.
After the the weirdest rolling around on the floor fighting ever filmed without the contestants being naked and covered in mud, the boys get the gun, get the girls out of the Zombifying room, and shove the lady doctor in when she won't de-zombify the girls.
At one point while watching the gorilla being zombiefied the spies watch it happening behind them over their shoulders and when Ivan comes to take it out of the room there is is this amazing nothing ten second shot of three people standing in a line looking over their shoulders at a blank wall.
The bit where Franklin tells Gortner she wants to make love to him (when they're holed up in a house surrounded by giant rats) had me helpless with laughter!
And when the attacks aren't on the movie is dull dull dull!
You know you're in for it when the hero is played by none other than Marjoe Gortner, an actor who is creepy even when he's playing it straight.
Perhaps if I watched it stoned, I might find it funnier, because everything is funny when you are high.
I have never forgotten the scene when Mary Currier(The welfare worker) comes to the house to interview Ann Revere and Garfield throws her out, and Garfield and Revere have words and she tells him better you should buy a gun then become a fighter and he says to her,"You need money to buy a gun."
One of their number is killed by the wasps, so the friends go looking for help, when they come upon a barn inhabited by giant chickens!
Most of the action is unexciting, and when you've got people battling giant animals - that really shouldn't be the case!
This merry jaunt is interrupted when some giant wasps kill one of them.
You need to have the proper perspective when watching these types of films..they're crap..we know they're crap..so enjoy the crap.
were somewhat off, but this movie just makes them look incredibly stupid when playing their RPG.
I used to like to play role playing games when I was young so I thought I might enjoy this independent film about a group of role players, but I was very disappointed.
I can't imagine that the writer and director were serious when they made this.
I used to like roleplaying when I was a kid, and even that couldn't get me to finish watching this movie.
And just when you think this is segueway into the meat of the story it turns out that the movie never really moves anywhere from that point.
I found myself waiting for the film to end and when it ended I was half in the mind to return the film to the video rental store and demand my money back!
I am a disappointed movie goer when Al Brooks fails to give me pleasure.
Everything just falls flat, and when you see the result you can't help wondering what the actors were thinking as they acted out their scenes.
The only surprise in the whole thing was when Pluto Nash found out who he was up against.
It is really sad that a studio would waste that kind of money (100 mil) on garbage like this when the set could have been put to much better use.
You'll notice best when it comes to the comedy parts (the attempts I should say) and the actions sequences.
Here the director's at a loss as well, which shows in sequences as when Randy Quaid's robot character is taking out his two canons for guns.
I take it, this is supposed to be a "cool" shot but the angle of camera, timing and pace makes it about as cool as when your dad hangs up his coat upon returning home from work.
All in all I would say there was a weak script to start with, that grew even weaker when it was handed to a director that couldn't handle the sort of comedy it was supposed to be, nor the action it was supposed to contain.
But what we actually get is the real sort of movie that the conservative critics have accused all summer-style movies of being: brainless formulaic uncreative popcorn entertainment plying to the lowest common denominator that is churned out when the bloated Hollywood studio system is working on autopilot.
And although Charlie weakens, he never breaks, and when put to the test, his basic honesty and strength shine through, which makes him a hero and which transforms this movie from just another boxing movie into a true cinematic classic.
Drummer Steven Drozd becomes the other major character in this movie when his addiction to heroin is frankly and almost shockingly discussed and portrayed on film.
Her most sensual and erotic scene is when one of the Evil Alien Conquerors feels up her hairy "unibrow".
-- the camera shakes when he gets slapped around, and "our" eyes close when he kisses the girl.
But sometimes one might enjoy a bad movie when it is seen as a historical context--but this is not such a movie.
2) Actors look self-conscious when endlessly talking to a camera.
Still, you can admire how hard all this was to stage and shoot, in a age when cameras weighed a ton, made too much noise and nobody owned a Steadicam.
the premise of hunting humans is good.the mind and thoughts of a serial killer and whats happens when the serial killer is suddenly threatened and challenged by a second serial killer.the internal dialogue of our star killer is hilarious(in a sick sick way).the plot is pretty original.but the acting,camera work,and sound are a lil high schoolish ,and the end gets corny beyond belief.
The plot itself falls flat when the multi-twist ending gets pushed in your face and you feeel like screaming, "Oh man!"
This is one that, when you think you've reached the bottom of the barrel but lift up the barrel and examine what's underneath, you find.
Imagine my surprise when I came to IMDb and saw an actual cast listing.
Like in the beginning, when the bad guys escape, but then suddenly a truck crashes into them.
Or when the Elite see the car of the bad guys, lying on a train railway, and say "They might still be alive", but then a train arrives and drives over the car, just classic.
I don't know if the failure of this film is due to bad direction, or to the real-life animosity between March and Veronica Lake (though I do think Lake did a good job of hiding her dislike of March when the cameras were rolling), or what.
ClichÃ©-ridden, sentimental, patronizing; you know you have a bad film about American Indians when you have noted British actor Trevor Howard pretending to be one.
In reading about them Carole Lombard's name often comes up as the "Queen" of screwball comedies, so when I saw this movie was on I decided to sit back and enjoy seeing the "Queen" at work.
I was so excited when I heard they were making it into a movie - and with such wonderful actors... well, I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I was.
Queen Katherine is left on the sidelines for most of the movie (except for her magnificent display of queenly outrage before the court when her marriage is called into question).
In another, she is trying on a "device" when Christopher and his mother come over to visit.
Especially not when you make Scarlett Johansson incredibly unattractive and knock down Portman's looks a few knots as well.
She returned to England when Henry changed allegiances from France to Spain.
One of the greatest historical quotes is from Anne in the Tower "when I no longer hated him, he began to hate me"  This is a great story if told correctly.
I am amazed that such an inaccurate movie would be made and the worst part of this is that in a time when women had little to no power, a young girl changed the face of the world.
Why, when the girls were just children, was their mother wearing a Elizabethan riding hat for her walking dress?
Then, why had no one given Bana a red wig when it is an historical fact that Henry VIII had red hair, from his mother Elizabeth of York?
Why did Mary wed Carey as an adult when in fact she was twelve years old when it happened?
Both sisters were sent to France to be educated when young; Anne was never exiled there.
Why was Henry portrayed as reluctant to take a mistress when by the time he knocked Mary up he was already father to Henry Fitzroy, Duke of Richmond?
of Aragon was fair of colouring; why was she made to dress in clothes like those of her daughter when portrayed in middle age?
Why was Mary sent off in a coach when the first person to have one in England was the Duke of Rutland in 1555?
What were Percheron horses doing drawing her wagon when they only 1st came to England in the 1880s?
Why is the King surprised to find Mary married when HE was the one that arranged the marriage to William Carey.
She was innocent of adultery but kept her mouth shut when she knew her fate was sealed.
Why can't directors seem to get it right when it comes to this time period?I understand completely the Hollywood concept of "dramatic" flair for the big screen.
Only when she discovered that her path in life would be to submit or face death or exile does she succumb to Henry's advances.
It also suggest that something other than Henry's brute desires were at play here when he charged them with treason, which is not the case.
Although Anne resisted for years, when she finally gave in to Henry, she did believe herself to be in love with himÂor at the very least, resigned to accept her fate.
He was a brute, but he was most concerned of his image of the romantic courtier when it came to women's affections.
I think Jeffrey Tambor is a fine actor, but Jill's character tries to make us believe he's rather desirable when he's rather overweight, with jowls like Droopy the dog (yes!
She was so thin in some scenes that it occurred to me that when do you see fashionable really thin women like her dating lumps of dung like him?
Sure THIS one is fact-based, but who cares when the facts are quite boring?
Since reading about the truth in " true stories " like PAPILLON and SLEEPERS alarm bells always ring in my head when the words " true " and " story " appear side by side , and if the story is in fact true ask yourself this question : If the events on screen actually happened then why isn`t the case better known .
There are also so many overly-stylized, almost campy moments that the film sometimes feels like a half-hearted parody of "The Exorcist" (the boys' 'good voice' when he tries to hoodwink the priests is utterly laughable).
The front of the box hardly looked promising, but when I read the summary on the back, (She's into her boyfriend, Bob.
The scene when Bob asks "Orange you forgetting something?"
The twist near the end, is predictable, and dumb, and i was just thankful when this movie ended.
Sure, chat is fine, but when it strings you along and along with even more lifeless chitchat.
After a genuinely creepy and tight opening couple minutes when Cathy was a child and throw in some motherly love.
Roy MacArthur had a bit a fun with his performance and lightened it up when on screen.
Quickly we move to the present when the young girl has turned into a young musician in love with a photographer.
When the beast gets the drop on him, he becomes despondent over his fear, so when it actually gets captured, he lets it go just so he can hunt it again and exact some sort of vengeance for being humbled so badly.
Predictably, he freezes up at the last moment of truth when confronting the beast and is maimed for life.
If the movie had been made today the cat would be a computer animation and Ralph Feinnes would have played the Donald Pleasence role, so we can be thankful that the movie was made when it was & by who bothered to show up: It is a forgettable little bit of 70s Saturday afternoon idiocy.
From the beginning, when both the narrator and Lundigan refer to "Cassius" as "Cashius", you realize that it's going to be a moronic production.
The result is about as successful as when Lana Turner traded her blonde mane to become a brunette in "Betrayed".
Raymond Burr's "Poor Man's" portrayal of Marc Anthony falls flat when compared to the likes of the work of Marlon Brando ("Julius Caesar") Richard Burton ("Cleopatra"), Claude Rains ("Ceasar and Cleopatra").
Then when she bails him out of jail, he doesn't dwell on the fact that she spit out $5000 for him, a guy she doesn't even want to talk to..?
Maryjane did not revive Fabian's career in Hollywood, when good teen idols are passÃ©, they usually stay passÃ©.
Itâs just another thing that they manage to reattach them too, when they get a new victim to sign up for the rehab.
One of the comedic highlights is supposedly when Dunne shoots a neighbor's pet bull.
I expected the film to be at least watchable, but the film lost me within five minutes when the Wahlberg character's girlfriend walks into his apartment, eyes a dismembered body, and says, "He's kinda cute!"
Well it has the John Woo flair with the explosions and the classic dual Berettas but this mish-mash of a comedy/action really falls flat when it's trying to be silly.
It reminded of that dreadful day four years ago when I walked into Hollywood Theater hoping to see an entertaining movie.
I cringe when I see those actors in their most recent disastrous.
Things look and are so different in ones mind when you reach 50 yrs on God's green earth.
Smith plays 'Bernard', one of four aliens from the planet Blob enjoying a holiday in a spaceship that resembles a caravan, when an accident sees them crash on the M1.
Anyone who saw 'Alas' will tell you they worked best when bouncing their humour off each other.
It's my basis for comparison when I find "Failure to Launch" to be a bad movie.
Romantic comedy is the genre with the most importance in our own lives, and Hollywood lets us down badly when hacks and marketeers write the scripts and stars phone in their performances.
If someone like me with no scriptwriting talent was writing this movie, and I wanted to show that even though the leading man looks like a bit of a playboy, he has the potential to be a committed and caring husband and father, I might think of having him mentor a cute kid and taking him to baseball games and stuff, and that would have comic potential because when the character needed to be told certain things, I could have the kid saying it and it would be precocious and funny and cute.
She only refers to Tripp in terms of the job, so when after about half an hour we have to be told Paula has feelings for Tripp, it is a surprise.
I wonder how she continues to be cast in movies when she has no range as an actress.
And when is this 40+ year old woman going to stop squealing like a stuck pig.
Yet there were times when there were some good one-liners.
Then, when he loses interest (Hello, you have nothing to talk to them about) and has a disturbing dream, he decides he might be gay, and goes to a gay bar by accident.
A fine example of this is Traci Lords, when she was a teen thru her 20's she was one of the most beautiful, sexy women on earth.
The Germans trying to untie themselves and not at all feeling threatened by a blind man, Sandling, sitting guard over them have the shock of their lives when Sandling becomes the worlds first suicide bomber!
Eric checked on her fathers sturdy and sea-bearing sailboat and held Eric responsible for her fathers death when he drowned in the dinky and water-logged dinghy that Eric left him when he tried to do the same thing, escape to freedom in England.
Fame would smile on Talbot ten years later when he met and became involved with legendary "Bad Movie" director Edward Wood Jr. and was cast in four of his cinematic classics; "The Adventures of the Tucson Kid" and "Glen and Glenda" in 1953 "Jail Bait" in 1954 and what many consider to be Wood's greatest masterpiece his "Citizen Kane" the superb immortal and unforgettable "Plan Nine from Outer Space".
As my first English teacher said when she was looking for something nice to say about one of my essays: "Good transitions!"
My neighbor lent it to me to watch and told me it was great, but she's clueless when it comes to horses, obviously.
Once there was a promising Italian director with a nearly perfect hand when it came to splatter fun like "Deliria" (Stage Fright) and who eventually delivered the exquisite, tongue-in-cheek postmodern zombie flick "Dellamorte Dellamore" (Cemetery Man) with Rupert Everett in his perhaps finest leading role.
Ask yourself this: why would these people need to generate favorable publicity for a movie when a good movie will generate its own favorable publicity through word of mouth?
The film is better when it plays it straight than when it goes for laughs (the final scene is a bit strained), but there is one extended bit where Clayburgh attacks a dildo - which is hilarious.
From director John Irvin (Hamburger Hill), I didn't pay the fullest attention to this film when it was on, but I guess it doesn't matter.
Which what I'd imagine ones demeanor to be when reaching their age.
This especially comes out when dealing with their sexuality.
The Amendment giving women the right to vote was only nine years old when this movie was made.
A technical note: If the couple was on Lake Michigan when the storm blew up, somebody needed to tell the author that there just ain't that many islands in the lake, and none within an easy row or swim.
But it's different when he makes a movie about it.
I'm sure American people will find it offensive when a foreign filmmaker who doesn't know much about western or cowboy makes a non-authentic western film.
It is a sad state of American or International Western society when movie audiences state that "they loved this movie".
What Tarantino was most praised for was the high-energy, witty dialogue that pervaded his earlier efforts, unfortunately in Kill Bill, the dialogue, when there is dialogue, downright sucks.
There are some unforgettably hysterical moments in this movie that will have your friends in stitches when you recount them.
Trust, love, and commitment are developed when we are tested and choose one another again and again, through good times and bad.
All that changed last week... when I watched "Lady Snowblood".
But what difference does this make, when the film in itself is completely unwatchable?
I'm really not sure what Tarantino was on when he made this but it surely must have been hallucinogenic and must have caused brain damage.
Still, when the writing is this delicious, and the cast is so attuned to the straight-forward, occasionally barbed material, the results can be joyous.
I knew I was in trouble five minutes into the film when it just didn't feel right.
(And shouldn't they get out of there when the airlock is opened to launch the ship?)
Scenarists MartinÂactor & novelist turned writer--Amis and Oscar-winning "Star Wars" art director John Barry establish textbook suspense by putting Saturn 3 into shadow lock when an eclipse occurs.
At one point, Adam disables Hector by overloading its batteries when the robot tries to recharge itself.
Many of IMDb's favorable reviews of "Saturn 3" begin with "This movie scared the wits out of me when I was ten," or something of the sort.
It's so fragile that, when it moves, the whole assembly shakes unevenly.
Unfortunately, this means that when the script calls for the monster to stare, frighteningly, at the audience, the camera must zoom in on this stupid, fragile head and lavish attention on it.
Neat cast of actors and you think it may actually have some value but on the other hand when Fawcett takes top billing over Kirk Douglas one begins to wonder.
Not one that Kirk Douglas will glowingly talk about when asked about his career.
I mean, when even the sets anger you, you know it's gonna be a bad movie.
And when I say madman and robot chase, I think pursue is a better word, as there's little fast movement where this robot is concerned.
I remember seeing this when it first out, in a theater, and thinking ... why?
Of course, things take a turn for the worst, when Keitel gets the hots for Farrah.
Kirk Douglas is just ugly, clearly he took this role to show he was still a leading man, yes, he may be in shape at 64 years old (which is how old he was when this was made) but its creepy!
If you going to make something this dumb, it better be shamelessly fun when it finally goes haywire.
Saw this years ago in the days when I would watch any film or TV science fiction flick, no matter how smelly.
(Imagine my surprise when a man had done it.
Their jolly lifestyle is about to end abruptly when the grumpy Capt.
I had watched this as a kid on local TV in the early 1980s (when only black-and-white sets still existed in Malta!)
In the end, one has to wonder what Stanley Donen was thinking when he accepted such a project - but, then, his career had always been somewhat erratic (including at least a couple more notorious false steps with the homosexual two-hander STAIRCASE [1969] and the bootlegging comedy LUCKY LADY [1975]).
Partly that may be due to the fact that the project was originally to be directed by John Barry, but Donen "inherited" the responsibility when Barry quit due to ill health.
However, Hector turns out to be a particularly unstable droid, particularly when the randy robot develops a liking toward Alex.
Her job becomes even harder when her husband's windbag uncle shows up on the doorstep from New Zealand.
In two years when no one remembers who these two are it will just make the show look old.
It can do everything just at that time when it looks like there is no chance for the heroes.
It was only when I realised which squadron his neck scarf and shoulder patch represented that I knew for sure what he flew in.
In the mix are sequences involving F-15Cs from the U.S. Airforce wing based in Japan (look for the "ZZ"s), all seen on the ground when our pilot was being discussed.
One that stood out for me, was when Nick Frost woke up from a one night stand, trudges silently downstairs and comes across a picture of him and the lady he slept with, married, including another with a child.
Now is when you'll probably be like "Oh ****, get out of there!
You'll have people freaking out at zombies 150 feet away, moving at .1 mph, screaming not to waste ammo when a gun isn't even needed to kill the reflexless things.
The whole look of The Zombie Diaries reeks of a home film shot on a camcorder with some awful shaky hand-held cinematography, there are times when it is literally impossible to see what's going on as the camera is pointed at the floor it it cuts peoples heads off the top of the screen or it just misses the action as it jerks around.
That being said the make-up on the zombies isn't too bad and the scares aren't too cheap, I did surprised myself when I jumped.
Although once they entered a secluded house that's when tension/suspense started to come in but then it just died a couple minutes later.
No hordes of zombies here,just a few here and there milling around,usually standing in a group waiting for their cue to fall when someone shoots a gun their way.Then the camera holder walks up and shows us the zombie laying there with a splatter pattern of brains and blood fanned out from the head all over the ground looking as though the zombie was shot up through the head from under the chin while laying there.Bleeck!At least get the basic physics right!
What happened to the good old days when people shot homemade porno when they got some camera equipment instead of their own horror movie?
I don't know about you, but when watching a movie I'd prefer to SEE the events unfold, as opposed to have to GUESS what's going on on the screen.
If they are your inspiration and influence then you might as well leave film-making to those who do not make the cameraman stand on a large rubber ball when shooting scenes.
I was extremely excited when my girlfriend pointed this movie out to me, but I couldn't find it to rent, so I had to buy it in order to watch it.
The lingering question is what happened to the news crew..we get a glimpse into the kind of psychotic Goke is when the camera man(..of the third story)discovers her bound and nude.
Their story remains absent so long that when we finally learn about what happened to them, it's impact is lost.
I think the directors were very ambitious in trying to tackle three stories at once, when one would've sufficed.
I wasn't impressed at all with many scenes where a gun shoots a zombie(..or innocent victim due to "unfriendly fire")in the head..it was never quite convincing, certainly not when compared to Savini's work.
Reminded me of a 10-min zombie movie me and my friend did when we were 14.
It's hard to believe that this movie is praised by some horror website when there's so much good stuff around, like the brilliant "REC".
I did have high hopes for it - there are times when a low budget indie-type movie can breathe new life into a tired franchise - but this movie wasn't it.
This first becomes apparent when the first group of 'survivors' encounter a zombie in a farmhouse they were supposed to be staying in.
I knew there was a problem when I had to turn it off about halfway into the film.
I remember being 7 years old and watching Dawn of the Dead, it freaked me out, I had nightmares for weeks, even seeing it when I was 25 it still freaked me out.
Cro-Cop is, with little doubt, the best pure striker in the fight game today, utterly lethal kicks and punches proof positive when his knockout record is reviewed.
Specially when he's fighting... You'll not see a lot of MMA (Vale-tudo) fights in this movie which is a shame.
Mirko Crocop is one hell of a fighter when it comes to K-1, Pride FC and now UFC.
I hope that Mr. Soderberg has the grace to blush when this leaden turkey is mentioned.
I remember my thoughts when I picked up the movie.
I don't remember where or when, so I rented it.
Steven Soderbergh is a brilliant director and he's one that is experimental by heart but when your already established in the industry these experimental films can be pretty risky.
But this is not and it's the type of film that young film directors make when they have no money.
Script and story is mainly about how things appear one way on the surface but are different when you look closer.
I am a firm believer that visuals take a back seat to script, when it comes to making a good movie.
It starts beautifully, in a studio-designed rustic setting (and the best set in the film); and then a rainstorm soaks a vacationing fisherman, who proceeds to go into the local town and ask for help in getting treatment for a head injury he sustained when he fell against a rock.
I don't remember in recent years a movie where I start watching the running time as early as I started with this movie: when it ran for 15 min I was already impatient, and for a good 1 hour or so I felt uncomfortable for not knowing anything of what was happening and not connecting but a couple of dots in the whole plot.
I rate this movie even worse than Burt Reynolds worst failure with Dom Deluise (when he and his cast appeared to be having a great time making an unfunny movie) because Soderbergh and crew have the skill to do so much better.
The one time the films stars aren't shooting their guns, is when they're polishing them...And the one time they're not killing people with their nicely polished guns is when they're having target practice.
Now don't get me wrong, when I say these guys shoot people, they don't just wing them or nick them...They fu**ing kill them...Dead mind you, deader than 4 o'clock.
This film was, obviously, made during the era when communists were considered to be the major threat to the security of the USA.
It's better when he's carrying a machine pistol, but he's "The World's Strongest Bodybuilder", not a martial artist or action hero.
Without giving away too much of the movie: There are NUMEROUS scenes where the heroes act DOWNRIGHT stupid and incompetent, plus quite often they run away like scared little girls when having an advantage in numbers during the "fights".
I mean, you know you're in trouble when Daniel Baldwin is the most gifted actor on the set.
As it is, it seems destined to be the kind of movie you find on cable at 3 am when you can't fall asleep.
PS: Normally when I say don't bother I kinda hope you'll watch and find the movie as bad as I told you it would be.
The preoccupation with sex on the part of the adults as well gives greater insight into the writer and directors' minds as epitomized in a scene where one of the boys on being rebuffed by a gay teacher gives some tart comment to the effect that "you are really daring when it comes to talking and thinking but something real happens, you get all cautious"(paraphrased).
Since when did kids in 1983 call someone a "fuck"?
We just don't care when he dies, and we don't care what happens to the kids, as told in the final scene, because the script doesn't go into who they really are, or what they want.
Imagine my surprise when scenes I had never seen before began to appear in this DVD version.
At this point, the Earl gets syphilis, becomes horribly disfigured, loses control of his bladder and has to start wearing a strap-on metal nose when his real nose rots away.
It's one thing if you call them but when they call me I long for lightning to hit their phone system and electrocute every last one of them.
The best scene is when Vince is trying to sell the old lady on the investment.
Thank God I recorded this film when PBS broadcasted in 1987.
I do not intent to because I have already seen the best; but will read the book when I find time so to confirm what everyone have said.
-the dialog is cheesy: remember when they talk about their past right after a murder with the beast out there ?
I was a bit grossed out when I found out that the main character cut his face off and gave it as a surprise wedding gift at the end.
By the end you get a load of gore that looks unbelievably fake (best joke when heads fall out his closet and he beats a guy with one of the heads which is obviously just one of these plastic heads with a wig on.
This movie star Elden Henson as the boy with disturb past and Kieran Culkin as the disable boy, they two become friend and that when imaginary adventure begin.
Less importantly, I can't figure out why Sharon Stone is the number one credit when the story isn't really about her character.
However, there were a few scenes that just felt overly tense, such as when--possible spoilers--Kevin begins choking on his food and loses consciousness, when Max learns of Kevin's death (which is more disturbing than emotional), and even the scene where Loretta is strangled (but not killed), which is otherwise understandable.
It's when the handsome and a bit skeptic, of Dr. Lombardi's psychic powers, Dr. TedErckson, Lance Fuller, comes on the scene that things really start to unwind with the by now mad Doctor Lombardi going so far as conjuring up this She, or Sea, Creature to do Dr. Erickson in.
You just have to laugh when the creature attacks people--and they just stand there and do NOTHING so it can kill them!
He calls it a 'transmigration of the soul', I just love it when a film utilizes that kind of pseudo-scientific babble to support it's plot.
Say, remember when police Lieutenant James listens to a conversation he had with Dr. Lombardi on a tape recorder?
And how about Chappel, when his gun runs out of bullets, he throws it at the creature in the tradition of all those classic Superman episodes.
The best performances come early on-- that's when the two stiffed-up dead people fall to the floor.
Morris wins because he gives his lines all the emotional inflection of a dial tone, and when he cuddles up to cutie Marla English for one of their many painful clinches, she looks like she wants to bang down the receiver.
Apparently a stupid sideshow hypnotist named Dr. Carlo Lombardi(if this guy is a real doctor, then I'm a Nobel prize winning physicist) keeps a pretty woman under hypnosis(this guy is the early version of Rohypnol, the date rape drug) for no other reason except that he can, and she won't touch him when she's awake.
Under hypnosis, her spirit reverts to a WAY former life, back to when she was a proto-human who lived in the sea.
I got really happy when "Saints and Soldiers" came out and begin to see it happening.
Rebecca Gayheart is supposed to be the character the audience can identify with, but her "I remember when the dorky kids were my friends, back in fourth grade" story arc is just ripped off poorly from Heathers.
What does it mean when Roth can't pull the trigger?
Boring boring boring,  I was very happy when it was over...
As I said in the summary line, in the end of the movie when the screen went black, had I not paid so much for my TV and if I knew it would have done good, I would have thrown something at it.
I rented this movie at least 10 times when we had it at our local library.
Scott Wolf does a good job in his role as the detective but when a twist in the story occurs and he decides he doesn't want to be killed, the movie just doesn't go anywhere.
You realize how clever the screenplay was once the film is finish, when you reconstruct all the matters and personal motivations in your head.
This is the first time I have ever seen a serial killer film in which you don't find out who did it, and it doesn't really matter anyway (and really, guys, the first thing I thought of when the body had something cut out of its skin wasn't "covering up bite marks," it was a tattoo)...
Things complicate when social worker Susan (Daphne Bunskoek) steps into his life and he wants to start off his own bar/restaurant...
The concept is pretty bold, actually it should have been the best prank in the movie, but it falls short because we do not get to see the targets of the prank when they realize that they have been taken in.
For instance, when speaking to the college students, the pranksters present a WTO-endorsed plan to recycle human waste and turn it into to hamburgers.
Not a well done film, but worth seeing how odd we humans can act when our minds take us down the wrong path.
The Brits really are the best when it comes to "cinematic reproductions of literary masterpieces",(as I like to call them).
I could swear that a male double was used for much of the full-body views of the nearly-naked Alex, and Alex's voice was always dubbed in, even when it should not have been necessary.
Anyway, when a movie includes flashbacks to earlier films and lengthy closing credits that replay many of the "best" scenes we just saw and STILL runs only about 77 minutes, you know something's wrong.
Well, at least I'll be spared hours of head-shaking incomprehension when I read on here in a couple of months rave review after rave review of a new mafia movie which features a scene in which the rat receives with relief and unconditional enthusiasm the message from the boss: "Sure, I know you helped set up the hit on my kid brother, and I'm not too happy about it.
I'm all for the suspension of disbelief when watching movies, but this was too much to ask the viewer.
Amelia Shankley was absolutely wonderful as the dark haired,contemplative Sara Crewe:not only did she look like Sara,but interpreted the part with such conviction, as if she were truly living the character, enduring her adversities with the complexity of a myriad of emotions that swelled in her young heart and pictured clearly on her sore-plagued face.But her eyes lit up immediately when she was approached by Lottie or Ermengarde,or any one she thought a kind soul, partly out of the comfort it gave her, partly because her proud little spirit would refuse to have it otherwise, but mostly because of her consideration towards others' feelings:she knew, because of her own craving for it, what the warmth of a kindly smile could do to kindle and cheer a lonely heart, and thus she afforded them with a conscious good will.
Maureen Lipman as the unaffectionate Miss Minchin was excellent as well-I couldn't have envisioned a better interpretation.Her authoritative nature,absolute conviction in herself, business-like mind, made her the unchallenged captain of her ship; she was a born leader, and relished conducting her crew with the correctitude she deemed right.She would ceremoniously give a speech to "her young ladies", as on Sara's birthday or before the Christmas dispersal of the pupils, and characteristically clear her throat when effectuating what she considered a rather jocular statement intended for the younger girls, as she did before announcing in an incidental manner her message from Father Christmas.A great touch that I thought went just right with her character.
She swallows her pride when Guy Clarence(actually Donald)offers her his sixpence out of charity, so convinced is he that it will provide for her forevermore; she gives a beggar girl most of her buns when she herself is weak with hunger, for she sees in her a poor waif -one of the populace- hungrier and colder than herself; she worries about the suffering of the Indian Gentleman nextdoor and prays for his well-being, despite her own forlorn situation.
Being quite fond of heist/sting/caper movies this looked like it was well worth a hire at the local DVD store when it came out.
It just makes me sad that when there are people struggling to get new interesting movies funded, that it is seen as more profitable to do a remake of a film that is only a few years old anyway.
Warlock's spirit, trapped within a scarecrow as his burnt bones lie in a tomb buried deep within the ground of his cornfield home, rises when the erected slab imprisoning his casket is disturbed as bolts of lightning emerge awakening his lifeforce..that's the best I can explain it, folks.
I have to admit it: I watched this over and over when I was a little girl.
Emma turns to Merrill (Sarah Paulson), who has problems of her own from a childhood incident when she was Emma's age.
Unfortunately, "Manhattan Parade" is a shout-fest -- apparently, the movie director didn't trust the microphones to pick up normal conversations, and when the movie was converted from its live stage form, nobody told the actors to stop playing to the balcony.
However, Lightner surrenders her feminist credentials early on when she meekly submits to her husband's demands that he run the company and she stay home where she belongs and care for their young son.
Shot from overly tight angles, the fight scenes are hard if not impossible to follow and their resolution is only clear when you no longer see one of the opponents standing.
At least when Hogan did Rocky 2 and The Rock did The Mummy they actually were both working for the company.
The worst goof in that sequence was Vinnie getting the "dead man's click" when the shotgun was empty.
Usually when a film stars a professional wrestler, more often than not it is going to be junk.
The scenes where Austin tries to act with some humanity when everyone else around him is murdering with impunity.
One of the most illogical moments in the film is when Young and the Japanese guy decide to fight each other, thinking/knowing that they're the last ones left.
But when the audience cannot properly see and enjoy the action, the end result is disappointing.
The basis is to show what murderous felons would do when placed on in a life or death situation.
It is when the story turns into a forced morality tale that it falls apart and makes the audience hang their heads and groan.
Stone Cold Steve Austin is a black ops federal special forces agent, Jack Conrad, who was infiltrating a drug cartel when he was caught and imprisoned in a Central American jail, bought and placed into the death tournament on a reality internet game.
Filmed using 70's vintage video instead of film , obviously not quality digital when witnessing the colour bleeds, faded backgrounds and motion blur.
And when she left the EM club, her blouse was unbuttoned and flopping.
The funniest scene is when Chong freaks out in the restaurant dressed up as a woman.
Thus when I entered the theater, I expected something spine-tingling.
At one point, when his character was soberly praising the merits of abstinence, I nearly fell out of my chair laughing.
The more I read books about science and evolution, the less thrilled I am with the lack of imagination when it comes to most aliens, who look like us only with different colors of skin, and a few strange protuberances.
But when you make a deliberately claustrophobic, cryptic film like this you really can't complain when no one shows up.
As a whole the girls do a better job than the males - even when trying to laugh the the three men just sound very amateurish!
The silent movies of Chaplain and Keaton are still wonderful; the Three Stooges are still ridiculous and funny; much in Norman Wisdom's movies is dated, but when he falls through a window he is still hilarious.
I recall seeing this movie when I was young and being a fan of the book (the 'tin of pineapple chunks' scene is still the funniest bit of writing I've ever read) but having just watched it again, I am sorely disappointed.
I was somewhat insulted, but when the film began settled for enchantment which was sufficiently strong to keep me around when the second installment (I think there were only two, but this was 20-odd years ago) came along next night, when I also learned that the picture would be replayed throughout the promo which allowed me to make a tape of it.
As intended, Sara comes across Â this mood is set even before the situations are defined Â as a true heroine, when adversity befalls her.
I can easily see the camera moving a little when the actor is replaced.
You also see the head moving when the actor gets replaced by the dummy of which you can then easily see the fakeness.
You can tell because when the dog growls he bears his teeth and you can see the canine's canonical canines.
First, a dog licks the water that the fish came in when it arrived on campus.
Later, when he did seem to understand what was happening, he actually deliberately injected himself to see if it was true--without really providing much in the way of safety of others.
We don't know why or when he left, so there's nothing really to gauge his past on.
For instance, she is supposed to be Irish and not have any luxuaries, yet when she does take her clothes off and actually speaks you can see she has very distinct tan lines and she has a strong American accent.
I try to be positive when watching a movie.
Generally, I can find something worthwhile in any movie I watch, even when the movie sucks ass.
In one scene, when Karan (Hrithik) sees the LOC for the first time, he claims being overcome by a feeling of belonging (to India).
Perhaps its me, but I find it embarrassing when Indian characters flick back and forth between English and Hindi....stick to Hindi if you are flying the flag; THIS AIN'T A CALL CENTER ADVERT.
Yeah, she is gorgeous, but i had never even heard of her, when you think Canadian supermodel, you automatically think of Linda Evangelista.
However, the film also contains an offensive sight gag, when L&H accidentally slap white paint all over the face of an African-American passer-by.
Perhaps the funniest moment in the film comes when Torn tells his sob story after he puts himself on the stand.
At the same time when dubious film companies are re-releasing the unrestored and horribly dubbed German pre-New Wave movies, the so-called "Kriminalfilme" and "Lederhosenfilme" and present them to a surprised American audience that cannot have any idea about the background on which these movies had been made, at this very same time the films of the New Wave generation that purposely cleaned up with this so-called "Papa's Cinema", are simply not available on international dvds.
Generally thought to be the first official Laurel and Hardy release(although PUTTING PANTS ON PHILLIP is also put in this bracket),the boys don't wear their Bowler hats and have their heads shaved,but are very much a team in this early effort,more so than PPOP where they play against each other rather than for.There's plenty of amusing incident and situations(especially when they attempt to escape the jail as painters);one slight quibble is that as convicts,the characters they have to play here have a very slightly more unpleasing edge than they would be establishing only a few films later in the partnership.Still funny though,and Jimmy Finlayson's double take and fade away is worth a few more laughs as well here;in early publicity material the boys were sometimes billed as 'Hardy and Laurel' in this film;that soon changed.
I remember seeing this film when it first came out, and also remember that is disappeared from the video store shortly thereafter.
These are not exact quotations, but when the guy with the hard hat says, `Awww Jasper, I don't know about that.'
And in the scene when another guy says, `Hell, if the engineer blew his nose too hard, the whole thing may break open.'
Cold-blooded baddies fill kitchen workers with bullets, who jump onto the benches to die, yet offer cigarettes to someone when they askÂ Or ask problematic hostages to put the gun down.
Things do not get off to a good start when Gloria takes Aaron on a private plane ride and they narrowly miss crashing the aircraft.
And of course, the gold-digging bimbo treats him like crap and he slowly starts to realize that perhaps, the real girl for him, is the genuine travel agent/photographer he spends a lot of time with on his vacation when the bimbo is constantly hanging out somewhere with more manly men who swoon her.
Especially when there are much better shows, like Playschool, Curious George, Shaun the SheepÂ
The chemical industry had developed "memory plastic", materials that could be deformed then spring back into shape when an electric current was supplied.
I saw this movie when I was a little kid.
(My friend bought it too)I was expecting some live performances and videos, but when I first saw it I realized it was so much more!
But there's something more annoying:one of the characters is unbearable,the notorious Jens:the scene in the restaurant with the prostitute makes me sick:this bourgeois student really demeans this girl thanks to the power of his dough.Seeing him humiliate this human being while taking out his banknotes is one of the most despicable scenes I've seen in years ;and that does not make the "hero"-who's watching- nicer either.Besides guess who will be sacrificed when the others will survive?Another gratuitous scene which comes at the most awkward moment involves Jens and his priest girlfriend in the church .It's really nauseating.That makes the very last scene even more disgusting.And you know ,I 'm far from being holier-than-thou.
Sadly, she couldn't even act like she was off her nut when she took that truth drug.
Janet, a doe-eyed blonde from Cedar Falls, falls hard for Brett, and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement.
All the footage of the band when they're on tour is so good.
So, we like to support our film industry, even when we make poor films.
It's easy to sense bad writing when stories falls flat after the setup or the first act.
But bravo for one funny scene where the husband makes an excuse, and lies that he lost his wineglass on the ceiling, when it clearly was an act of anger.
I always say the sign of a bad horror movie is when you want every character to die, just so the movie can end.
And that's a lot to say, when Halloween is just around the corner, and I was watching this at night with a couple of friends.
It scores a point for nudity but the kills are pretty lacklustre, when compared to some classics such as Friday the 13th, Halloween 2 and The Burning for example.
Just think what a young John Carpenter or Tobe Hooper (when he did good things) could have managed with this flick.
It's just about watchable but to be honest I almost fell asleep a few times and I was glad when it ended.
Saw it when it first got released on video in 1984.
The most unrealistic part of the movie is when the assumed "Big Man on Campus" is hitting on the campus hottie who is ready to bed him, but then he turns around and says "Who is THAT?"
In other Kitano films I have seen, such as KikujirÃ´ no natsu, Sonatine and Zatoichi, there was violence (particularly in the latter two) BUT there was also a certain likability of the main character--even when he was not a "good" guy.
In addition, the movies abounded with wonderful little moments and extra touches that gave them charm and color (such as the idiot gangsters trying to shoot things off each other's heads when they got bored at the beach in Sonatine or when the weird guy in the diaper kept re-appearing in Zatoichi).
We kept on guessing the movie would show what 'it got' in the next 5 minutes, and we kept repeating that to ourselves every 5 minutes, but when the movie ended it still had not happened.
Except when he got so frustrated he just acted angry.
In a year that has seen banking profits tumble and financial institutions collapse, it is simply too much to believe that a financier could orchestrate a civil war when it has become obvious that modern bankers cannot even balance their own books.
In an age when business news is hogging the headlines and people are becoming increasingly financially literate, the film offers only superficial insights into the corporate world, which was much better examined by Tony Gilroy in Michael Clayton.
We tend to forget about him entirely when he's not directly before our eyes.
Scenes previous to the climax, when the robots went out of control, were very unsatisfying.
I admit, I was at the edge of my seat during the pursuit, and very pleased (and relieved) when Richard Benjamin's character, which to me had the appearance of an attention-deficient 10-year-old with a mustache, showed that he indeed owned intellect.
Why does the robot-wench at the end (who Richard Benjamin thinks is real) short out when he gives her water, yet the Yul Brenner robot-gunslinger character (among other robots)can pour whiskey down their mouths?
What, when a violent enemy swings a mace at your head, it has a "sensor" to stop it in mid-air just short of splattering your head?
He is supposed to be "off," yet when we first see him, his thumb is turned up.
It's so badly lit that when the film finally goes outdoors to rip off the end of Gallipoli (which it does incredibly badly, like everything else) the change of film stock is so jarring it hurts.
The characters weren't developed enough for me to feel sympathetic for when they get picked off at the end.
Since when did the Brits build trenches like the one seen here ?
Olivier went back to England and didn't make another film in America until Wuthering Heights (1939), when his talents were much more appreciated.
Audiences can tell when a 6-foot-three actor playing 6-foot-six is dunking on a 9-foot-rim doubling as a 10-foot-rim.
As it happens, Michael Jace bears a reasonable physical resemblance to Michael Jordan, when Jace is playing the bald, late 20s, early 30s, Michael Jordan.
The film pretends like it never happened, because when the film shows time run out in the game, Jordan is in the same spot where he hit his jumper, and his teammates rush to him to congratulate him.
In reality, the Bulls averaged around 6,000 fans per game at home when Jordan first joined the team.
Being a basketball fan, I started to tape this movie when I saw that it was coming on the Family Channel.
NCAA Championship won the game outright when in fact there was still time on the clock and the other team failed to score.
The special effects weren't terrible and there a few well pulled off moments (like the jittery ghost doctors), but overall it didn't enhance or cook up much of a lasting atmosphere when they finally pile it on far too much.
It also bugs me that they must walk into a person's office when they're lost, especially since they know where it is and in spite of a few of them being killed along the way.
It seemed like an okay movie at first, when they showed the black/white clips, but after that it went downhill and hit the bottom hard.
Just when I think the movie might not be so bad with her in it, what happens?
They are so undeveloped and stupid, you actually find yourself happy when they are killed.
What could be a great psychological horror falls short when the writer decided to tell nothing about what is happening and why.
His masterpieces have wonderful soundtracks by composer Fabio Frizzi, great cinematography by Sergio Salvati and the kind of surreal and infernal ultra gory imagery that will stay inside the mind especially when experience for the first time.
It is so bad, as unfortunately was the state of Fulci's career when he was forced to make films like these.
This one makes no sense, the gore is cheap, and everyone, including Lucio must have been sleepwalking when they made this.
It's question of time when sinner's ghosts came back to get their death toll.
It's similar to kid's look when they are forbidden to eat sweets/play computer games/whatever.
But all of these are nothing when we compare it to the ending!
Isn't it compelling to watch someone struggle to suppress their real feelings for the sake of a promise made because it gave her "comfort", even when the reason & need for said comfort has been removed?
1. when her father disapproves of him & she tries to honour her engagement to another man - 2. when she feels too guilty to be with Gable now that her father's gone, because dad died while chasing her (!)
- 3. when Gable goes off to war - 4. when he first visits her at the convent & she sends him away - 5. when he finally stops pursuing her but promises to love her for the rest of his life ... and get ready for one more!
On this issue "Vietnam: A Television History" uses a communist spokesmen, Hoang Phu Ngoc Tuong, (who is believed to may have been the one who ordered the killings) to explain the deaths as 'the people of Hue so hated those that had tortured them for so long that when the revolution came to Hue the people took actions into their own hands, there was little we could do'.
The only other character that was remotely interesting was Agent Ray Collins who was slowly coming to grips with the reality of vampires when they decided to kill the character needlessly and ultimately granted him no more relevance than an extra.
We don't know about other people, but when we watch a movie/ series, we want to be lost in the moment.
)but when you have a scene of 20+ people fighting.. you dont zoom in!!
You know something is wrong when a movie is 3/4 of the way over and you still haven't got a clue what's going on!
In those rare instances when I could follow what was actually happening, the choreography was good.
Unfortunately, these bits of promise were interrupted by inept camera-work that is usually invoked when the movie-maker is too lazy to painstakingly map out fight scenes or brainstorm over fresh combinations of moves and maneuvers.
While watching the opening action sequence, for instance, I literally felt like vomiting when exposed to back-and-forth rapid-fire framing that necessitates a warning on the front of the DVD that this film may induce epileptic seizures.
You know you're in trouble when you constantly can't help saying to yourself: "I could act better than him, I could act better than her!"
To McLish's credit, she looked good in the film which was made when she was about 40 years of age.
When I was only about 14 I rented this movie with my best friend, when we had the brilliant notion that maybe all those movies we'd never heard of really were worth watching, so we picked one that seemed to have a cool cover.
The climax of the film was when the protagonist built what was supposed to be some sort of unstoppable war machine, but looked more like an errector set experiment gone horribly wrong, and nailed to a $50 junk-yard reject of a vehicle.
You will be able to pull reason, information and remember content from when you were drawing in class, on the day of the test from your heart, your courage and a magic hidden talent you possess deep inside you.
It is important when watching this series that it is not meant to be a remake of the book.
It seemed like a surefire idea for a comedic star-vehicle: Shirley MacLaine as an infuriatingly stubborn former First Lady whose love-hate relationship with Secret Service Agent Nicolas Cage is tested when she's apparently kidnapped.
I used to watch this show at my grandma and grandpa's house when I was a child.
I used to believe it was "real" but when I was older I realized it was not.
Lom said in an interview many years ago that he never saw the movie after reading the reviews when it came out.
I don't know about you, but that never seemed to entertain me for a half hour (then again, when you have no cable and you live off of video tapes as a little kid in the 90s, what can you do?)
You can't help but think about how disastrous the current situation in Hollywood is when the umpteenth representative of the infamous category "clichÃ© ridden, sugar coated American cute movies" arrives, and you've got to go see it because your niece is crying about itsince the first announcement.
This movie pushes itself even further, though, when it kicks the cheap cry pedal.
The film's second act begins when Kit's father loses his car dealership (it's interesting that he was still able to have a thriving business as late as 1934!).
Complications arise when handsome young mountain guide Johann (Lambert Wilson) appears on the scene, and Kate is immediately smitten....   Five Days One Summer is very nice to look at (full marks to cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno) and Sean Connery gives one of the most multi-layered performances of his career in a very complex role.
I remember when I first heard about this movie; Seagal, Hopper, and Sizemore in a movie together; it sounded like a fantastic movie!
Why are half of his lines spoken when he's off camera?
What's up with the sound editing when Sizemore is interrogating Pressly?
Seagal doesn't throw a punch until near the end of this movie, and when he does get some action, the camera is so close in on him, you don't really see the moves.
Or, how about a hand grenade that, when detonated, erupts as a fireball instead of a shower of fragmented metal.
There is one good side to this movie however and that is it can be used in video classes at universities to show an example of what not to do when making a movie of any kind, for example, don't even make a movie that is so boring people can tell by looking at the actors faces.2 : spend the extra money and get a wardrobe so the actors can change clothes 3: don't use archive footage and if you absolutely must use archive footage don't get footage that doesn't make sense, like a single car exploding next to a body of water doesn't make sense when matched with an explosion or accident of two cars in a land locked area.
So once again I would like to commend the director and editor on making a great instructional video on what not to do when making a movie.  
Only one stupid scene where we only see Seagal's face and then a shot from the back when his double(probably)is fighting(if you can call it that)for him.Meaning,we never actually see Seagal fighting.
*spoiler (somewhat)* The movie started out nicely with a blown up house etc etc, but it really took a drastic turn down when Romany Malco tried a death scene which was ..... everything from a death scene.
I especially like the bit when the car brakes and the blue screen background stops instantly, that was a corker, look out for that bit!!
He just sits there, at his desk or in his car, except for the last 15 minutes or so when finally he decides to kick some ass.
Walk, not run or jump, even when men firing their guns come after him, he takes his time to get some cover.
It becomes much more serious when the next victim is obviously human, and in a much more deadly trap, and they are trying to access anything that will lead them to the creator and killer, but it is "untraceable".
We the audience obviously see the killer, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), and takes a while for them to realise it is him, but when they do, after about one or two more victims, including Jennifer's good friend Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks, Tom's son), Jennifer finds herself the next, and eventually last victim of the deadly traps.
They should simply be caught when the law traces where unusual quantities and specialized items have been purchased.
Was it necessary to utilize Diane Lane and Colin Hanks when the latest Playboy centerfold-turned-actress, and, I don't know, maybe Chuck Norris or Steven Seagal could have easily fit the bill?
The catch is that the more people log in to watch, the faster the person goes, which is supposed to show how cruel the common people are - since when you are dying under excruciating pain, you want it to last longer.
But as well all know, or at least all of us who use the internet for many reasons including and what I consider to be the most important of all and that is to seek out the truth when it comes to news the internet is in fact the last bastion of free speech, well in Europe it most definitely is.
The only scene I would save is when Jerene and the guys are in the park.
Why can a film studio do this when others would be charged with the crime that this is if they filmed it?
Computers bleep and boop every time a key is touched, intensely suspenseful over-the-top music at almost EVERY single point of the movie (no matter how un-suspenseful the moment actually is) and the creators try to get across a message that people are inherently evil for wanting to watch torture when that is exactly what the audience is sitting there watching!
There was not a single moment when I was scared.
I cannot ignore the patently ridiculous when realism should be expected.
In fact, when her friend called in and said I think I am on to something, I'll tell you about it later, I laughed out loud.
There were many other smaller issues, like when she picked up the phone on the bridge and said "I am an FBI Agent!
This movie got a sad fame, when it was rumored both the two main actors (Wayne and Hayward) and the director initiated their cancers from the work in the New Mexico Desert Fall Out area.
Yes, pilgrim, get out of town when the Conqueror rides across the steppes of.....Utah?
Another really bad part was where they did the filming, you could tell that it was filmed out in the desert out in Utah, because since when did the Gobi Desert have small plants and cliffs and rugged terrain in it?!
Hughes personally bought back the rights to this film (along with Jet Pilot) when he sold RKO in the late 50's.
A strange point is when he tries to categorized which type of child pornography "really" bothers him.
But once that is past, then one is left with direction that seems to come out of a school that is based entirely on a time when MTV still made music videos, with touches of would-be 300 knock-off thrown in either as unintentional or as sucker-punching for genre fans.
Highlander: The Source may have a chance with repeat viewings when it gets released on DVD.
The problem when you see a movie adaptation of a book you have already read -- and loved -- is that either the adaptation is not faithful and betrays the book, or it is too faithful and just looks like a summary of the story.
The conflict starts when Philip decides to come out to his parents, making his father face his own desire and his mother confront her own prejudice.
The rest looks like a result of a brainwashing Monday morning session when no ideas were crossed out.
This film is really bad, while you have several characters from the Great TV series, it is clear they knew crap when they saw it because they gave nothing in their performances.
the effects of the head slicing is better and i was surprised it happened, but from that the special effects are half ass , the story line is boring and tiring , there is not one single section of the story or visual that makes you actually want to stay in the cinema to watch the film, it simply gives you the feeling of when you were watching a bad b movie in the 80's where the budget was extremely low and with no talent behind the camera.
Initial fears were realised when it was revealed that the film was set "In The Near Future", which stirred up bad memories of "Highlander II".
Methos is reluctant to involve his former good friend, Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul), but is forced to when Duncan encounters The Guardian, the Immortal Anti-Christ, while searching for his ex-wife, Anna, who is somehow drawn to The Source.
Speaking of The Guardian being bad, it's really hard to fear a villain when they talk in a funny voice and act like a complete tool.
Especially when the end result is as dismal as it is here.
With a sharp story, tremendous irony, brilliantly low key performances, and elegant direction and cinematography, THE LOST LANGUAGE OF CRANES received tremendous acclaim when it debuted in 1992; a decade later it has lost but little of its original punch.
The first thirty odd minutes of this focuses almost entirely on Will, Jayne & Darren & feels more like a teen soap opera than a horror film & when the horror elements do eventually kick in they are pretty lame with Will trying to be turned into a Vampire & a bit of bickering between Julien & Claudius to see who is harder but they both come across as wimps anyway & really don't put up much of a fight at a very weak climax.
It is a short film that will be easily forgotten and I doubt it will be redistributed when the next line of Blair Witch 2 products come out.
Well, there is a third question that begs to be answered: why the heck would Garrett want Swanson when he has Gladys Jimenez at home?
It's not really that interesting when red herrings are thrown at the viewer AFTER you know who the killer is.
This movie is being made in an era when the Anastasia/Anna Andersen hoax on which the Bergman movie was based has been exposed via genetic testing.
Plot threads that are emphasized early on, like Sergei's unrequisite love and the growing tension with Tanya, are never really resolved and come to a screeching halt when the fire erupts.
I remember one scene when somebody shoots a machine-gun at Norris for two minutes and not a single bullet approaches him !
I mean how hidden can you be when your camoflaged in black and your hiding against a white building.
If you don't believe me, just try not to bust a gut when you see the last frame of the movie.
I remember I've seen this when I'm 15 and I could not get a ticket to another film.
Scenes of helicopters making outrageous pick ups or so many Vietnamese henchmen with poor aims when it comes to shooting Chuck are some examples.
The sword work was the same back and forth swings little kids do when they play sword fight.
I think the best part, action-wise was when they had a capoeira guy do some cool inverted kicks and handstands and flips.
The only thing that roped me in when I started watching was the production design.
It's sad when the best fight scene in the film is the one with the gun, and not the hand to hand exchanges or swordfights.
If you thought Tarkovsky was a one-shot in the Soviet Union when it came to beautiful yet haunting images, you'll definitely think again after this movie.
I felt so sorry for you guys when you did this "Turkey of a doomsday movie".
The action and script are virtually incomprehensible, and the multitude of characters seem to make things up as they go along, hamming it up as and when they like.
The film starts well but unfortunately, it goes downhill when the action switches to the mansion house.
I'm actually amazed that the makers of "Apartment 1303" weren't sued when this film came out!
The poor Ben character just comes across a likable schmo, who takes it, but when he dishes it, everybody looks at him like he shouldn't have done that.
The only times when one feels the old Canadian maverick kicking in is when we see the video camera moving in on the man's face (Leslie Carlson as the actor, who has a great, unique face for long, lingering hand-held close ups).
They lost me when Father Frank actually planted electronic listening devices in Ben and Sadie's home and it just goes downhill from there.
But now I realize simply that I have been watching good movies, and "License to Wed" is a healthy reminder to myself that I can still recognize the sight of horrid cinema when it veers before my eyes.
The only good part in this movie for me was when the Reverend got punched out by Ben.
Mandy Moore is still Mandy Moore: Beautiful and talentless when working with lazy scripts.
We love you, but we hate it when you waste your talent on crap such as this.
Needless to say, lightning rarely strikes twice when it comes to Hollywood happenings and "License to Wed" is no "Meet the Parents."
While it sounds reasonable enough in theory, the Reverend goes so far as to invading their private lives, even bugging Ben and Sadie's apartment with concealed recording equipment, letting him hear everything that happens when he's not around.
And when Ben discovers the wire tap, why doesn't he make a bigger deal about it?
It's hard to get behind a cast when they're forced to play clueless morons for the sake of the plot.
I was more than a little tempted to just get up and walk out early in the movie, when it just wasn't funny.
The whole thing made me miss the time when Robin Williams in a movie was a sign it was going to be a great film.
This begins with a good scene that was duplicated in a later (and much better) Ronald Reagan B-movie, SECRET SERVICE OF THE AIR, in which a pilot, smuggling a Chinese family of illegal aliens, dumps them out in mid-air to their deaths when he's attacked by another plane.
The pilot, angry when his boss won't pay him for the aborted delivery, calls the Feds and offers to give them the goods on the smuggling ring, but is shot to death just before the agents raid the Chinese restaurant which is the front for the gang.
Blackmer gets one nicely slimy, almost campy line, when he says, "Orientals have a peculiar irresistible fascination for me," but despite the promise of the melodramatic title, this one will hold no one's interest.
They brag about how alternative they are and naively believe they do not conform to any sort of image when they clearly do.
The swords must be made of plastic or wood or something, because when they fight, it looks like they're fighting with stick, whacking each other over the head with not a drop of blood in sight.
Our helicopter hero is worse than Rambo, even when fighting on the ground.
They only manage to kill the guy when they decide to use ANOTHER useful resource: The Angry Rant While Firing.
The best part is when they arrive at the base.
but I don't mind American patriotism when it's part of the plot.
Also, it looks bad when they use poor computer animation for some of their helicopter scenes.
Unfortunately, when the city itself turns out to be the best part of the entire movie, you know you are in trouble.
Filming occurred on weekdays, when the Faire is closed.
Overall, the film virtually leaves us as an audience to feel, when all is said and done, that it is little more than an artificial and slightly shallow misrepresentation of many real-life situations similar to what Panabaker's character goes through here.
Good, you're qualified to be a historical consultant when the sequel comes around.
I wonder what happens when you wipe out your Doppleganger... One annoying character down, a man we couldn't forgive anyway because of an earlier scene in which he threw his own urine onto a passing 'villager'.
It goes on like that, spices everything up with her father dying and her finding out he was HIV positive right when she is trying to turn her life around with her second child and her learning progressing in a new school.
Its a totally average movie and it gets down to this when you see how people her either call it "best of all time" or "worst movie ever".
But what frustrated me the most is that when actors are mumbling, as more and more are doing in movies, there is too much background noise (music in this movie), so it's difficult to understand what the character is saying.
But honestly, when this movie was done all I could think was that I am SO OVER the whole "black thing".
But when a positive movie like "The Great Debaters" or "The Miracle at St. Anna" come out we don't support it.
He grows infatuated by Sara, one of the residents when he spies her naked n the bathroom.
So much is his fondness that later when he sees her standing in the middle of the street (she had wondered out of the house) he decides to take her back to his mom's place (where he lives, mom's in the hospital after falling out of a taxi) for some nookie.
Things get complicated when Ronnie's druggie brother, fresh out of prison, shows up a day early and decides to party with his equally pathetic friends.
My nightmare scenario would be to suffer sudden total paralysis in front of a TV when this movie comes on and therefore to be unable to either suicide or destroy the television, rather than watch it again.
One of those late late late show movies on cable that you watch when you cant sleep or have nothing better to do.
Where's Eddie Deezen when you need him??
Considering the Monkees' history, however, they were probably glad when the entire ordeal was over.
It's weird to think that when this aired, The Monkees themselves were complete has-beens.
Everything you need to know is established in 15 minutes and when they step back from it to create the gangsters they end up too wooden and sentimental to be believable.
However, when he sings, I feel someone else would have been more suited for the role.
I like the way that Jacey wears glasses at home and contacts when going out -- I don't think I've seen a movie take that much attention to detail.
For this reason, students generally avoid breaking dress code; when occasional violations occur, they try to be inconspicuous about it, so as to avoid getting in trouble.
The director doesn't know when or where to stop with the OTT stuff and just tell a story.
For instance, it spends more time on the wife after her death than when she was alive.
Or we really do not feel the loss when she's killed and yet the direction makes it so that it's like the most important thing in the entire film.
John Lone gives an amazing performance, when everyone else is screaming their dialogue at the top of their lungs.
Too many uninspired scenes, like the overlong moments when the Chinese mobsters talk endlessly about the virtues of being in the mob.
The last scene, when Rourke's presence causes a riot and then he and Arianne kiss, is so corny that it's truly embarrassing.
The fact that (with a few exceptions that ran 2 episodes), each story was limited to less than 30 minutes (the commercial breaks which accounted for the "less than" were surrounded by fade-outs of some new terror arising - which, even the youngest viewer realized after a few breaks, would be a false alarm when it resumed) rushed the plots of stories I laughed and fascinated over in book form, giving no time to absorb the scares, other than the phony ones resolved in 60 seconds while the camera dimmed and returned.
The weaknesses in the story are going to be very obvious as you watch - you're barely able to accept the premise of the story when Rogers is suddenly accused of a crime.
But, I know a good movie when I see one and this is not a very good movie.
However De Niro - despite top billing - is not in this film very much, and when he is, he's not very impressive.
People might look at my screen name and think that my dislike of this movie is based on its left-wing politics, but this film is no funnier (and no more meaningful) when making fun of hippies, JFK assassination bugs, or artistic charlatans than it is when making fun of "establishment" figures and soldiers.
And I can usually cut writers of parodies a lot of slack when something isn't outrageously funny.
Asking a Wiccan-esque girl if she was a lesbian *may* have been funny on its own, say, a decade ago when every high school didn't have its own Wiccan chapter, but now it takes a little more insight to make that stereotype funny.
They obviously are trying to emulate the movies of the Zuckers (you know you're in trouble when a character in a parody mentions a funnier parody), but at the same time they didn't understand what made them hilarious.
If every movie is sold out in the movie store and that was the only one left, then that's when I would get it.
This is all normal looking in comparison to Divine's role when he accidentally hits Pearce with his car and attempts to take her to the hospital.
Scenes were completely drawn out, particularly a sex scene that had my friends and I looking at each other thinking "when is this going to end."
You see flashbacks and photos of the love she had, and lost, when her mother packed-up Jacey and her sister and moved them when she found out about her daughter's pregnancy to a place where no one would know them.
What most fascinates me here is the different tastes people have; I simply can't believe it when people praise this film.
The director (Jean Jacques Annaud) got himself into a confused mess when trying to make this good versus evil movie - he's comfortable depicting all Nazis as bad but he can't depict all Soviets as good and tries instead to portray a complex grey area.
There are several scenes when you can see it in the background about 3/4 finished.
That way their girls will continue to think they'll be heroes when the team wins the big race.
He also was a key character in Morse's "One Man's Family," playing Cliff Barbour when the series started in 1932 until he died.
Yarborough had a distinctive voice that doesn't seem like much when you see him in Let's Go Collegiate.
Another radio highlight for a little kid listening alone one afternoon to, I think, Jack Armstrong, was when a beautiful and evil woman dispatched a victim by taking a hat pin from her hair and driving it into the guy's ear.
Jacey was supposed to put the baby up for adoption but when push came to shove she just couldn't give her Son away, so her mum decides that she will raise the baby and Jacey will just go back to High School and lead a normal life, like it never happened.
Now, I next to never cry but at the end when Jacey decides to let the Coopers adopt her son,Charley, is so sad but yet happy.
I totally lost it at the very end when they were making the home video of Charley's first day at Kindergarden, I was in tears the whole scene!!
but it is not easy to plan a military operation without alerting the authorities, especially when your employer don't trust you.
I can believe that the whole part when Shannon assembles his team works well in a book, when you can elaborate and create some suspense.
In a movie, like this, when you have to cut it down to a few loosely connected scenes, all suspense is lost and all we have is a long dull waiting before the action finally begins.
And when the coup starts it is a quick and easy one.
When you finish one of his novels you're likely to know how to rig up a bomb that will explode only when the car hits a bump.
Just before the invasion, the mercenaries are together going over the attack plan one last time and when they are done, Walkin raises his fist and shouts the name of the dictator they are about to murder and the other soldiers echo his gesture.
Quillan, as Queen gets involved with the mystery after he meets the owner when she arrives in New York by boat.
The Mandarin Mystery is what happens when you take a fairly standard locked room mystery, add a little too much romance, and season the mix with an ample supply of humor.
(Zuniga gets some rear shots, but is pretty skillful at arm-placement when facing the camera.
Not at all a contender for being overly amusing as Stooge shorts go but when another supporting actor/actress is added that can obviously hold her own, comically, then there's hope yet.
Joe seems to be getting it right here especially when he has to clean up some cases of eggs that he spilled out and broke.
- Just when you think it's over, a TWIST!!!
The part that really annoyed me about this movie was the fact that when they would talk about girls doing slutty things in high school, or dress code violations, the girls would stand up and show themselves off while the guys whistle.
It did have some unintentional amusement, however, like when the huge mirror weapon powers down and the general (using very poorly dubbed lips) spouts "Dammit, why is everything going wrong today!?"
As Godzilla approaches off-screen, it turns it's head curiously, then flies into rage when he's visible.
It's quite strange to see such maneuvers, and feel completely out-of-place when relating to a monster.
It goes off in one distance then changes when it's apparent it won't hit the target and curves back to hit it.
The back-fin animation is only done on occasion, and is off-model when it does appear, a grievous error.
I definitely hated how they made Godzilla's fire breath look like electricity, for a minute when Hedorah (Smog Monster) is marching towards the military base, I thought the military was using some kind of high tech weapon to destroy it.
The dumbest thing in this film (which is not the plot or how slow the creatures walk) is when a little boy yells for Godzilla while he is walking away.
It was very inspirational, especially for those mothers, when the whole room stood up to applaud the girls for their courage.
Peck is given some choice howlers, like when someone raises the likelihood the Crown might try to prove Maddalena killed her husband, having put her in jail for it and all that.
Doesn't rate even the 2 1/2 stars given by "Maltin", except that he is correct when he says "talk, talk, talk".
The production looks good (particularly when Valli is led down into her cell, or when Peck inspects her glamorous bedroom), but the courtroom showdown is rather rote, as is the finale.
Time and again, we hear of the "unfeminine" curiosity of one woman (whose interest is entirely prurient), and we see the absolute SHOCK on Peck's face when his client says that an adulterous affair in her past was at her initiation.
Though the images are quite good (CG image), the movie has no astonishing moments that one could expect when computers do the job.
Being from the old school, I experienced wet-eyes when news broke that Disney put an end to hand-drawn animation.
In World War II (when this film is set), homing pigeons more or less cleaned up with 32 out of 54 awarded for displaying conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty whilst serving with British Commonwealth armed forces or civil emergency services (according to Wikipedia).
Ewan McGregor is a pretty good actor when he appears on screen.
when Troy says "Food!")
Every scene in this movie is done so horribly that I don't know how this movie actually made it to a theater) Christian Malcolm is such a great action hero like when he chases after his truck and has to jump in the back with the cult right on his heels.
I mean, come on, when it's above 50 or below 40 degrees it never starts right?
And just when I thought I was going to be able to at least accept this movie on its own terms without giggling hysterically at every new scene, along comes a character channeling Yosemite Sam.
Hopelessly silly plot best summed up when Troy and friend Zap enter a cave.
Is there no one around to notice that something's amiss when hooded goons take a chainsaw to her front door?
Well, I've never seen a Huffy outrace a muscle car... but I guess when you are making a completely irrational film it is certain to happen somewhere along the line.
Sadly enough, they come closer to catching him on foot than they did when they chased him with their car.
Finally, when it seems as though these villains are about to catch Troy, he hops into the back of a truck.
The funniest part about this scene is when the villains car treads off of a hill and takes a long winded drive towards a creek.
After a bunch of useless scenes, horrible acting, and utterly retarded dialogue the "climax" is reached when Troy kills Satoris and in doing so saves the world from the necessity to continue this horrible film.
And yet, when it appeared it was considered "smut" and there were widespread cries for censorship!!!
It's a very important movie historically and I have shown it to my history classes when we discuss American cinema.
This is even more apparent when she woos a very young and handsome Cary Grant.
And its no wonder it was a flop when originally released.
And when a fatal incident in a residential home brings him to the publics attention, Joanna's pompous scientist father surprisingly declares him a walking miracle!
Then when I saw that tonight TCM was highlighting Danny Kaye movies and that "Wonder Man" was on next, I rushed over to IMDb.com to read the reviews on it since I had never seen or heard of this Danny Kaye movie before.
Buzzy can possess Edwin's body when he wants to, and make him act like an idiot.
Characters who act funny when normal characters are around are NOT FUNNY!
From there on, Buzzy possesses Edwin only when he wants to -- not when Edwin needs him to.
One of the most painful scenes in the movie comes when Edwin is called to testify in the D.A.
Another part that was ridiculous is when the Phantom rips out Carlotta's breast and threatens it cut them off, whats up with that???
I became fan of his when I watched movies like THE BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMMAGE, DEEP RED and TENEBRE.
Especially when Ennio Morricone's hauntingly beautiful music is played.
I started to see the film's decline in the scene when Christine and the Phantom meet for the first time.
MarÃ­a's friend is only interested in the sexual part of their relation and immediately insists on having an abortion when he finds out she's pregnant.
Some symbolism is used in this movie: Vecino's dog (loyalty but also guardian) is used to remind us of the disloyalty towards the father the mother experiences when she meets Vecino.
The director Benito Zambrano has good storytelling skills, but lacks visual imagination when it comes to the medium of film.
Steckler was on his movie-making class when he start discussion with students where he told them that he could make a scene in the dark with using only his camera and two lights.
That's because when Steckler made the film, it was silent!
The 12 coins when gathered together are supposed to confer untold power to their owner.
Disappointment sets in when you realize this is not horror, just odd.
or "it has a 28 point 8 bps modem" (even when 28.8 modems were state of the art, who called them 28 point 8 BPS modems?)
In any case, when an audience member asked the director/writer, Michael Burke, why he chose to give the film the ending it has -- which was undoubtedly the lurking question that everyone was mulling over but afraid to ask -- Burke answered, "Well, I got to the end and -- that's what happened!"
Besides which, most of it simply becomes irrelevant by the second half of the movie, when everything hinges around a straightforward martial-arts-school showdown.
But when the fights do break out, even when Jackie is actually involved, this isn't the almost cartoonish, balletic violence we see in his other movies.
Later, when Steve Zahn finally returns to help the guys out with their Day Care, does the audience finally chuckle for the first time since they sat down to watch this turkey.
Only when Zahn is on the screen does any of this play out with any sense of comedy.
I ultimately decided to give this film a chance despite its awful critical reviews based upon my experience that low-brow comedies are often brutally panned when in fact they achieve precisely what they set out to achieve by providing low-brow laughs.
This has to be one of the one of the worst comedies to walk on the face of the Earth,the acting is dreadful,the plot sucked and Eddie Murphy put on a bad performance.I've seen Eddie Murphy in the Shrek movies and he put on great performances.It's about to lads who call themselves losers and put up a daddy day care center and they soon find out that they can't control the kids and an inspector comes and says they need more staff or else he will shut daddy day care down but fear not...the two boneheads have a plan that doesn't seem to work and daddy day care gets shut down.The only way to reopen it is to find a bigger place,more staff and try to get the kids back from some school for kids aged 2-4 or something like that.This movie is a real joke that can't make you laugh instead it makes you sleepy.The story isn't that bad but nothing is funny except the part when a kid comes out of the bathroom and says "I missed"and Eddie Murphy looks in the bathroom and the music from "Psycho" comes on.
Jeff Garlin wasn't that good, like when compared to everyone else he was weak and not very funny either.
Without getting into any spoilers hopefully, all I can say is that when watching other movies similar to the way this story is told in which it seems to jump around with no clear direction, just didn't work for me.
I kept waiting for all the pieces of the story to come to a conclusion, but when it finally does (kind of), the story I think should have ended.
It is nothing more than a poorly made film that gives those involved a chance to show gory scenes, unrealistic dialogue, a glimpse of a nude woman in a lewd act (lewd when shown in public) and does very little to connect to the audience.
I always love it when a bunch of really bad dudes fire 1000's of rounds of ammo to hit someone a couple of times.
Anyway, when you finish watching this movie-crap you feel that someone got framed indeed.
It must be very hard to pull off a complex and fragile plan involving various highly volatile and unpredictable individuals without their knowing they are part of a hustle when you can never be quite sure from day to day whether you are going to make it through to sunset.
And why have 8-ball signature logos when everyone knows the game is 9 ball.
I also noticed when "Jericho" and "Cueball Carl" (*rolls eyes*) are playing, they rack the balls in numerical order.
Then, when I'm actually watching the film, it will turn out to be about physically unattractive middle-aged people smoking cigarettes and discussing abstractions.
Things get worse when she gets pregnant and her self-centered bully of a boyfriend refuses to take responsibility.
And when she visits her husband in the hospital, her husband sniffs her and tells her she stinks of other men.
He actually does nothing in the film, until the climax when he shoots some pool and a gun.
Which is obvious when you listen to other lines such as "If I'm Lyin...I'm Dyin."
At times feeling like Airport '77 without the plane or the all-star cast, 1978's Gray Lady Down came out in the dog days of the disaster genre when Charlton Heston's career as a big screen leading man was on its last legs, and there's a sense of tired routine to this tale of a sub stranded on an unstable ocean ledge after a collision with a fishing vessel.
I kept thinking of that terrific scene in "After the Fox" when Peter Sellers is on trial for smuggling while using the pretext of making a film to disguise the crime.
How can you expect to have any suspension of disbelief belief when the dialog sounds like it's written by idiots like me?
There were a few instances where a funny line should have been inserted as when Gene Hackman was reduced to eating through a straw, but all that was uttered by our leading dud was, "suck hard".
One day when McCloud is out of the office, Hope happens to be there when Dorothy Lamour slips in and, mistaking him for McCloud, hires him to unravel a mystery.
Given his superstar status, I thought I'd try out a Bob Hope movie when I came across this one.
The movie comes to its real essence when Ana becomes preganant and her boyfriend refuses to take up the responsibility and asks her to abortion.
I say its a best movie when one cannot jus leave his/her seat, its when you feel every bit of the characters are going through, its when every node of the music makes your herat beats.... You can expect everything from it that you expect our of a classic!
The plot when analyzed simply doesn't make much sense.
The caretaker-sculptor turns out to have invested in Microsoft when he was twelve (doesn't everybody?)
I feel a bit like the girl in the cheesy teen horror flick, as she dials 911 for help when the killer is right in the house with her...
You know you're in for a heap of trouble when a movie starts out with a man driving a Jetta drinking out of a bottle of Jack Daniels just after being paroled.
Now, to be fair, they never made any secret about the relative ages of the characters on the show: the birthyears given for the characters (when possible to deduce) pretty much matched up with those of the actors (within a year or so).
They should have done this in 1984, not 2004: all of the actors would have been alive still (except perhaps Richard Deacon, depending when they filmed), unsedated, and not all that old; and maybe Carl Reiner would have been fresher as a writer.
In an early episode of The Sopranos two of the younger gangsters are forced to wait for entry into a nightclub when Scorcese pulls up and is ushered into the club as a VIP.
you only see full-scene shots when the 2 "fighters" are walking around each other slowly, the only "contact" shots are extreme close-ups.
In Rotterdam, when Kevin Burke (Skeet Ulrich) is promoted to chief of security of a multinational investment bank, he goes to a hotel with his girlfriend, the executive of the bank Rosalind Bremmond (Katherine Lang), to celebrate and propose her to marry him.
I know animals are better looked after nowadays when in a film and there are stricter rules to protect them.
It's rare when I am THIS out of sync with a film.
The film is mostly a one-lady show where Julie Harris plays a 12 year-old even though she was in her mid-late 20s when she did this.
I first became aware of this movie back in 1971 when Rich Little plugged it on Dick Cavett's show.
An unmarried woman would have been bad enough, but when it s a married woman, that IS in fact an act of adultery and so is lusting after a married woman too.
Sometimes something sounds good, but the bare truth of it all leaks out when you have a crappy director leading the helm.
I believe when it comes down to it, when faced with tangible evidence that the bible was in fact real, humanity will GET IT and UNDERSTAND THE STAKES.
The characters spend their time ANGRY at God that their loved ones went to heaven, they curse Jesus and scream "I hate you" when they find Grandma has gone to Gods Kingdom, how stupid is that?
It's SO good and she screams so bloody loud when she finds out her husband is with Jesus that I need to record it and have it as my outgoing message.
I was quite annoyed when one of her songs was interrupted for more stupid gags.
I cried watching the movie because of the end, just look the scene when the mother's sleeping in front of the sunset.
Fantine is not a prostitute either, because it's bad to promote prostitution as a way to survive when you cannot support your starving child any other way.
Anyway, Marius, not seeming overwhelmingly disheartened when Valjean won't let him marry Cosette (and also says they're leaving for England), ends up at the barricades.
I laughed very hard when I saw that skull.
But, his subject never seems to cooperate and instead, enjoys toying with the couple one evening aboard a yacht when a bloodied woman appears to have fallen overboard (film which conveniently goes missing) and then later, during a weekend in the producer's penthouse high rise.
To be honest I was pleased when she left the series and actually enjoyed her performances in her subsequent and inevitable comebacks.
There is a wonderful scene between the two when Alvarez-Novoa has an attack of diarrhea and Galiana insists on helping him.
Um... Duh... Ah... Who needs ten lines when one will do?
I love it when these European amateurs poke fun at Hollywood while they themselves aren't capable of making one good movie per decade.
This sets up the whole scene with the bad guys are trying to kill Princess Sira when she's on the barge with unsuccessful results because Ursus is there.
One wonders why they even bothered to kill her when Ursus was there, visible for all, including the dumb villains, ready to save anyone in peril.
And one wonders why they even bothered to kill Sira in the first place when the rest of the movie is about the villain, King Zagro, trying to force her to marry him?
Since when do women, certainly royalty, wear masks on their so-called happiest day of their lives?
If I had seen this when it first came out, then I would have thought it unfathomable that Tom Hanks would ever win even one Oscar, much less back-to-back Oscars.
This is a movie that one would watch on a Sunday evening when there is nothing else to do.
They killed the Ra' Zac easily when the Ra' Zac are still in the third book.
Eragon is a poor movie at best that fails to be entertaining, especially when compared to the other movies it is copying they style of such as "Lord of the Rings" and "Harry Potter".
She has allowed herself to be used by a man, not unlike her unfeeling father, and her protrayal makes us sympathize with her, particularly when she finds she's pregnant and the man refuses to help her.
The producers changed the whole plot and facts including: 1 the egg that Eragon finds looks more like a pill than an egg and when he touches it, it gives him a fat spiral on his hand instead of the shining palm.
When I first heard that a movie is going to be made by the book "Eragon" by Christopher Paolini, I must say I was very delighted, and I was even more delighted when I heard that Stefen Fangmeier will be the director.
Director Doug Sadler has extracted some of the best acting out of some of Hollywood's most underutilized talent: Cherry Jones playing Julia Tyler, the strong, persevere-at-all-costs mother; Robert Knott playing Will Tyler, the cash-strapped father who loves his family, but who falls apart and seeks escape when his plans for providing for his family fail; Sarah Paulson playing Merrill, a young woman with psychological problems rooted in her childhood; and new-to-Hollywood child actress Tara Devon Gallagher playing 11-year-old Emma Tyler, whose sudden need for a medical procedure becomes the source of the crises and redemption, and through whose both simple and profound perspective the beautiful story is narrated.
NO....he was downright serious and thought he was on the same level as Mozart, Puccini and other opera greats, when he wrote this meandering sack of crap known as "Trapped in the closet"  He sat back and thought he wrote the 'Magnum Opus' of RB songs.
However, there are no clues as to what the promised continuation will centre around, or when it will actually be made.
My favorite line is when the midget (and i love that he's referred to as "the midget") says "oh god, I think I just shitted on myself.
I saw some eps of earth 2 a long time ago (i don't recall them as being anywhere above a 5 star rating), but when i saw this episode today i felt animated to write a review.
The fun actually started when they "got a theory" about how this time-rift whatever works.
I was confused reading one after another so laudatory reviews; I began thinking that I really wasn't paying attention when they aired the show.
I thought we reached the bottom of the barrel last October when we went to see 'space chimps' but that was long before Donkey Xote (DX).
This is one case where it's better when you can't hear the leading man!
I have no idea why it qualified as a two-disc special edition, but at least I can put a couple of beverages down on my table when a friend pops over without the stains on my fine mahogany.
I guess we have institutions like The Daily Mail to thank for this film; not for the making of it, but rather for the fact that it still has audience when it should have been forgotten along with most of the rest of the Last House on the Left rip-off's almost thirty years ago.
Also, the fact that you know what sort of movie it is and when it was made ensures that it's always obvious what's going to happen, thus meaning that you're sitting there waiting for it.
Having lived throughout the depression and the Presidency of F D R, I was pleasantly surprised when I happened upon Roughly Speaking on T C M last week.
The only really interesting and effective element in the film is the soundtrack that consists of very strange and high keyboard voices and waves that naturally are among the things that make the film look and sound so weird when compared to other films of its kind.
I saw this movie when it screened in Cannes and oh my god.
FOr some reason, every 20 minutes or so, when the plot was starting to suck, dead bodies fell from the sky..
One of the signs of weak direction is the inability to know when a scene should stop, and it is so evident here.
Well, they do tell you the horrid of aborting a child, but I think the moral value is lost when you can't even make it to that point of the movie without losing your patience, and your mind.
'This is the place that I belong', Ting-Yu (the child) said when her mother was holding her in her arms, crying, wishing they could live together happily ever after.
I have enjoyed many movies, but when I watch a movie such as this, I get angry.
The only Italian kid I remember from the book is Guido, Teresina's son, from when George and Opp were in Italy during WWII.
Raised by parents who experienced the Great Depression and WWII, I can imagine a time when such optimism was not deemed overly sentimental or unbelievable.
I remembered when this piece of crap premiered, I heard the good people of Nashville were mad as hell at the obvious insult to their city and state.
I was really surprised when I saw this film tonight.
So i was looking around at the video covers in the videostore when suddenly my attention get caught by the cover of 'Invasion X' (the italian choosen name for this movie).
Meanwhile Ted Gage (Daniel Cosgrove) has returned home to see his family but before he gets an opportunity to see his Brother Brian (Chase Hampton) he dies in mysterious circumstances when his flat blows up.
The bit when Brians flat explodes is taken from Rush Hour (1998) & there's a bit when a house explodes lifted from another Swarzenegger film, Last Action Hero (1993).
Louise Randall Pierson went from a childhood of privilege to almost poverty after her father died when she was still a girl.
The cop captain is the usual skeptic who does nothing, and the head honcho nasty guy is a comical stereotype, who snarls when he talks.
The worst scene has to be the very ending (SPOILER AHEAD) when all the little bugs "form together" to create one giant, enormous "bug" that attempts to kill the hero.
Surely it's a bad sign for a film when the producers rely on Mr.Rourke for his "star power" to pull in the crowds.
The CGI is so bad that when the bugs attack one guy in particular it looks like a gray liquid is covering him.
so again, here i was expecting to be scared, when i was just plain bored.
i really hate it when it Hollywood misadvertises like that.
She finds her own life is in danger when she ends up in the opposite end of the game.
I was thankful when the series was over, that I would probably never have to witness them again.
But when I watched it, it felt that there was not much more in it than I had already seen in the trailer.
chicken little is not that a good film it has animals pretending to be human and the plot of the sky falling down was not really good i think when they make a animated film with animals just use them as as true to life as they get like a talking parrot that helps people not like a fish with a helmet full of water how would the rest of his body coup with the surroundings.
So, he doesn't inform his father, even when the fish is taken away.
We're first jumped into a chaotic scene, that BEGS me to laugh with an Indiana Jones joke and a chain of baby rabbits, when Chicken rings a bell in an Oakland town to warn everyone that the sky is falling in such a panic, later revealed that an acorn fell on him.
At this point, why did I have to watch the first half of clichÃ©s and sport montages when he becomes the village idiot again?
The story is the familiar story of most movie-goers' childhood, hidden deep, but it is in there, about a chicken who, when hit by something from the sky (pine straw, perhaps?)
I don't mind these guys taking a camera and goofing off... bringing copies around the office, but when you go to this extreme to b.s.
I miss the days when IMDb wasn't bastardized by this kind of b.s.
Maggie's intentions are noble but we don't feel for her, not even when her son becomes aggressive after learning of her new job.
The real culprit, however, was French director Alain Deruelle, who proves that he can be just as inept as Jess when it comes to delivering jungle horror.
Everyone else flees into the "jungle" when the parents finally show up looking for their little girl and are picked off one by one by in unexciting ways by the tribe.
Only when one of the thugs rapes the lady of the house, her husband almost literally feeds them to the cannibals.
You know you're in trouble when even the gory bits in a movie are dull.
However, when one of them rapes the home-owner's daughter, the bunch is left to the nearby cannibals.
Bedrock looks OK you can easily see that they've spent a lot of time working on it trying to make it look just like the cartoon but the story compared to the one the cartoon has is a definite insult just look at the ratings that this movie has here at IMDB 4.4 right now (March 7th 2000) those guys at Universal should have back in 1993 (when they were writing the script) well the story is really bad let's make a movie combining 4 of the most popular episodes in one story that would have been a very good idea I'm sure that it would have had made much more money than the 358.5 million it made worldwide even though that is a lot I know that if they had a better story it would have like 500M or more.
And when we get there, it's an odd mix of comedy and drama - as if the director wants it to be both, but without any success.
It might sound interesting plotwise, when someone tells you the story, but it's not interesting at all.
I remember seeing this way back when I was 9 years old.
It just isn't as good as when it was hot the first time.
I first saw this movie when I was 13 and thought it was the most suspenseful, exciting movie I had ever seen.
It starts sinking when the plane is forced down; none of the crew except the pilots bother with belts, let alone sitting down.
It then "bursts into flames" when the overeager rescuing pilots have to be restrained from going searching for the Duke without any idea of what to do or where to go.
Rarely have I enjoyed a film this much when I also found so much wrong with it.
Maggie (M. Faithful) receives the moral high ground in her confrontations with both her friends and her son when the truth of her vocation is revealed.
Her son makes a fool of himself, vastly over-acting and over-reacting when he discovers his mother working in a sex club.
This time we are introduced to a new hero, who was trained as a ninja when his father was killed by an armed robber.
But, when danger threatens Sean, Curtis is only willing to help out a friend(how they are friends is never elaborated upon).
Michael Dudikoff is a poor actor, but when compared to David Bradley he almost seems like the next Laurence Olivier, Steve James returns but ultimately this sequel is far too awful to dig up any entertainment value in this garbage.
I will admit that this film had one scare--when you find out who is riding the motorcycle at the end.
Then we move to Tarantino, right out of Pulp Fiction, remember when Jules and Vince escape a barrage of bullets miraculously and Jules is changed forever?
It's like when these bozos in Hollywood decide to remake the old Twilight Zone series.
Daninsky offers them refuge when they become lost, and it is not long before he becomes romantically involved with Elvira (convenient, eh?).
Paul Naschy plays a man who turns into a werewolf when the full moon is out.
I saw this in a theater (which was cool, despite the terribleness of the film) and the biggest crowd reaction came when one of the reels ended right in the middle of one of the lesbian scenes.
Of course, when it reappeared, the lesbianism ended abruptly.
Luckily, Elvira and Genevive find relief when a mysterious man named Waldemar appears out of the blue, to offer them a place to stay before the night falls.
What the hell were they thinking when they made the awfully thoughtless decision to air this tripe?
To avoid scandal and the possibility of divorce and losing half his fortune, Auteuil and his lawyer concoct a scheme whereby an innocent bystander (Gad Elmaleh) who happened to be very close when the incriminating pictures were snapped will be paid to pretend that Taglioni is his girlfriend and living with him.
That alone isn't necessarily a problem, but when you've got a really ordinary, simple storyline you've really got to work to make it interesting -- and alas writer/director Francis Veber doesn't do anything with the material that isn't highly predictable and dull.
The few action scenes that are in there are so bad it's a relief when they're over (usually after 5 seconds), and everything in between is just unbearable to watch.
How can they wish for a sequel when this movie's numbers suck.
But when you put her together with Chris Klein, it creates a void of acting ability that would have made it impossible to buy into the plot if the plot were actually plausible.
And when she threw a fireball in that final confrontation, it was probably the worst special effect ever seen in a big-budget movie.
There were a lot of quiet or dead moments, but those seemed to work out, not only for use as a scene change, but to convey just how bleak, when you really sit down and think about it, most people's lives are.
Even her so-called friends and their reactions when they found out what she was doing.
Worse, when do you see M. Bison with a bamboo stick in the game.. NEVER!
To a person who paid 85 dollars to get the Street Fighter Championship and Hyper Edition on Sega Genesis when it first dropped, this movie is not just a disappointment, but a mind-boggling failure.
The acting is horrible, plot is stupid and when you look at the cast before you even see the movie you already know its going to be a bad movie.
To name a few, Kristen Kreuk as Chun Li: OK she wasn't that bad in the movie but as a fan of the game, when I think Chun Li I definitely don't think Lana from Smallville.
Taboo as Vega: OK I don't know what the hell they were thinking when they mad this casting role because this itself screams box office flop.
But when her businessman father is unceremoniously whisked away in the middle of the night by a ruthless corporate tycoon bent on ruling the world, Chun-Li agrees to be trained by a martial arts master so she can get her father back and bring the villain's empire crumbling down around him at the same time.
And again, when it came out on DVD.
The funniest part was when Chun Li's dad was being dragged away by Bison's Crew.
This leads to the horrible, horrible accents that the actors had when they were talking in an Asian language.
And that is pretty much all that is discernible from a plot that bounces around more than the heroine when she battles bad guys...and girls.
No decent high-ranking detective, like Sunee claims to be, walks around as scantily clad as she does when she's at work.
Most of the time when Chun Li is kicking ass, it's entertaining.
After hearing the words "semen-stained dress" during national news broadcasts, from the lips of super-square Dan Rather, no less, on a nightly basis during the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal, a grandma-cum-sex trade worker who orally stimulates anonymous men at a gentleman's club has less shock value than it might have, say, in the late-seventies, when Diane Keaton starred as a slutty schoolteacher, looking for love in all the wrong places, in Richard Brooks' "Looking for Mr. Goodbar".
The hand-job soon becomes a normal job, like an office job, which is the case for anybody involved in the sex industry, as exemplified when Maggie brings into her "office", some personal effects from home.
And when I finally did, I was very upset with it, as they changed a lot of things around, and it was a pretty goofy movie for the most part, didn't take itself overly seriously at any point.
And then of course there's the generic cop team trying to investigate and not having one clue as to what to do until near the very end, when all they do is storm a building.
Chun Li is meant to be Chinese yet you've chosen an actress who has problem speaking the language in the movie (when for example she asks for help which she asked in a terrible accent).
Take Marvel for example, their world interacts a lot of different marvel characters, but when it comes to their own movie/cartoon, they actually make the story relevant to the characters life(e.g just because Bison was the boss, it doesn't mean that Chun Li's life has to be revolved around killing him (which is what Ryu does)).
For example when Bison was trying to show the camera that he had a picture of his wife and daughter, which were dear to him; First off, would Bison do this?
Usually a narration is present to help you discern elements of a story that you might otherwise miss, such as a character's thoughts and feelings...but when she goes on and on talking about everything that you the viewer are already seeing on screen, well...someone was definitely trying to pad their script.
M. Bison's entry into the early set was particularly painful to listen to, and Balrog's cheesy entrance into the scene was so god-awful that I was actually pining for the time when he held a video camera as Chun-Li's cameraman back in 94!
Am I supposed to believe Bison is all evil when he continues to nurture his daughter?
This artful and poignant film is a perfect balance between the sadness of how impotent adults are when a child is ill and the laughter that leavens the sadness.
The projects as whole compositions collapsed under their heft, but when they impressed, they really did.
Where he gets into trouble is when he tries to impose narrative.
One of my favourite Japanese films of recent times is "Battle Royale" and as anyone who has seen it will testify, Kinji Fukusaku (the director) was no shrinking violet when it came to blowing people up.
There are many specific moments in this movie that requires critical acting such as the moments when Azumi's internal struggle begins.
Therefore, when you watch those moments, you see nothing but a posing high school girl; no mimics, no posture, no feelings exposed, no acting.
The only really good thing about this movie is the baddies - a good range of character actors doing fun turns - but when i find myself wishing that the bad guys would cut up the good guys I know the movies onto a loser.
The screenplay, if one can call this one note monstrosity that, was written by Shore and some guy named Kirk Fox, yet it all smacks of being a vanity project, laced with bad one liners where the B listers try to recall who Shore was, after his 'death', then rail against him when exposed.
You know you're film is in trouble when a supposedly funny scripted line by Chris Rock, 'No Pauly.
I too was smiling like the Cheshire cat when I first read the title of this film, wishing it was a doco.
I still think one of the best scenes in South Park was when Mrs Crabtree screamed at Pauly Shore and made him pee his pants.
Keeping her employment a secret from everyone, she is the brunt of gossip from her old cronies and when she gives the money from her job to her son Tom without revealing its source, she causes a riff in the family.
Pauly Shore, in his directorial debut (if that fact doesn't scare you away from this film already), had this idea in mind when he made the mockumentary "Pauly Shore Is Dead".
A recurring line you hear a lot during the movie is when Shore approaches a famous friend (like Charlie Sheen or Vern "Minime" Troyer, who play themselves) and asks them, "Is there a part in the movie for me?
One such part is when Shore, while in jail, is put into the hole and has a clairvoyant conversation with Adam Sandler (who provided his own voice in this movie).
It just looks bad when it's not done right, and he didn't do it right.
But, Pauly Shore is Dead proves that it's not funny when he's in on the joke.
Mainly because these two were an exception to some of the self indulgent rockstars and wannabes, Sunset Strip was best when it focused on the relationship of Nick Stahl and John Randolph.
Not too much to recommend but it's not horrible, so it's the type of film to watch when you're bored and feel like an oater, but not something worth seeking out or re-watching in particular.
), and as usual, when watching these types of movies, frequently the bad acting takes over the movie and it can be hilarious to watch.
We read mixed reviews about Umrao Jaan...one is always apprehensive when going to see a remake of such a classic...not sure what to expect..I found the whole tone of the movie to be so morbid and Grey.
I must admit that when my friend told me what it was about I thought it would be one of those dull good-intentioned but poorly made movie.
I echoed a very positive review for this film when I watched it and completely because I had not seen the Rekha starer Umrao Jaan.
She performed really good, especially in scenes like the one where she tells Sunil Shetty that she will only be a dame for him (after the song 'main na mil skun jo tum se') and towards the end when she tells Puru Rajkumar that she has forgiven him and the scenes that follow and many more.
Repeatedly telling us how bad record executives are is harmless enough, even if tedious, but the film becomes simply dishonest when it raves about the greatness of record executives in the past.
The whole cinema laughed at loud when an actor called Manda appeared on the screen, even tough it was not supposed to be funny.
The story is given every conceivable, foreseeable twist and turn - a romance with the sex bar proprietor who just had to sample her talent on the sly; her friends who are dying to be let in on the particulars, but still are too prudish not to turn their backs on her; her son finding out and flying into a rage, and the reconciliation with her hostile daughter-in-law when she learns about Maggie's sacrifice - all predictable, but still: I liked it.
Obviously the budget was spent on special effects as most of the actors dully slog through the script, which has only one bright spot, when Robot-Gaily begins to wonder who she was before.
Henry Thomas was much better in E.T., and even he seems to realize there just isn't much to work with in this tired story of the boy with a penchant for fantasy who isn't believed when something rather fantastic actually happens.
I seriously think this should have been rated PG-13, simply because: What kid 12 and under wants to imagine that when they get rid of their imaginary friend by stomping his toy into the ground, the imaginary friend becomes real and gets a bunch of bullet holes in it and bleeds to death in front of the kids eyes?
"This is what happens when innocent young children are left unsupervised so the adults can go off and drink and have sex," we can almost hear Jeffs saying while she wags her finger at her audience.
I've been watching the last 2 seasons wondering when the're going to do something unpredictable or at least something noteworthy of how the show used to be, and yet nothing's happened.
STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh   Gladiators was a hugely popular show at weekends on ITV when I was a bit younger.
Amazingly it ran from 1992 to 2000 when really everyone had become disillusioned and bored with it around 1995.
For about half the movie, when guy loses doll and before guy gets her back, Doll Face the movie flops into angst and anguish, with over-acting by Blaine and far too much screen time with her and her ghostwriter, Frederick Gerard (Steven Dunne).
The relationship Yvan/Odile is predictable and provides the low point of the film.The one sequence which reaches something out of the ordinary is when the wunderkind starts singing an operatic aria ,in German,which is all the more disturbing.
As for the tear jerker ending, Warren can't even come close to replicating the look on Cary Grant's face when he realizes the devastating truth about Deborah Kerr.
Posing as a representative from a farming company needing to fill tractor orders, he gains the trust of the town and in particular, a woman (Melissa Gilbert) and her young daughter who buys his story, trusts him, and then, along with the whole town, shuns him when they find out that he might be cutting their job.
But, nonetheless, it is an innocuous little distraction when you just need to put up your feet and watch a movie that might make you smile a bit during the holidays.
I unfortunately own a copy of this movie, and I spring it on people when I'm feeling particularly evil.
You know a movie is bad when you have to dub an English speaking actress into English.
I hope that years and years from now, when all the old msties get together and lament the movies that never got the MST3K treatment, this movie will rank at the top.
This truly bad, stupid, softcore flick must be seen to be believed, but only when you are ready for extreme trash.
Besides, I got my copy for around 7 bucks, and I'm fairly confident I can get at least that much when I sell this piece of crap back.
She borrows money from Miki and gives to her son, who becomes suspicious and when he follows her and knows about her new profession and is deeply hurt.
At one point in the movie when Maggie is forced by her son to leave the work, I was longing for Marianne to go back to her profession Â because that had brought her self- dignity and self-esteem.
Because after all, we're supposed to laugh with this one, and when it comes to the humor, it is as dumb as it gets.
And to make things crystal clear from the get-go, the fun already starts in a most verbal way, just before the opening credits, when evil sword-wench Sultana shouts "I will have my revenge!
Blond Barbie-doll Monique Gabrielle (in a double-role, no less) was as painful as she was funny, watching her deliver her lines trying very hard to strike the right comical note (or vicious note, for that matter) when called for.
Her dancing skills were limited to 'wiggle waggle, bounce & shake' and 'duck' when a hurled brew-holder comes flying over her head.
The only other scene that matches this occurs when Jarek kills a henchman during a conversation using water fountains to communicate.
A medium that places cameras everywhere, and makes it known to the participants; a medium that terms it's programming "reality TV" when NOBODY is real when they know they are being watched, appeals to the stupid among us.
It started out as a funny movie, but when all the "glitches" started and went on and on and on, nothing was funny any more.
Also, in a time when minority roles on TV and in films is actually shrinking, it was most disappointing to me that neither the bachelor character nor his girlfriend had anyone who was of a different race or disabled, etc., in their circle of close friends (people that stayed with them throughout the movie).
This is when Mickey Mouse debuted in the cartoon PLANE CRAZY and just a short time later, Mickey scored one of his biggest hits in his second film, STEAMBOAT WILLIE, as it was the first cartoon with a soundtrack (with sound effects and music).
It's sad when the supporting roles are played better than the main ones.
This movie was critically destroyed when it was released, but it is not that bad, it is just a harmless little romantic comedy.
Jimmie and Anne are developed within a brief three minute opening scene where one meets the other at a coffee house when they exchange about ten words with each other.
Watch it when you have the time.
Asians in Hollywood film are not to blame when a picture fails like this.
There was once a time when it could at least be considered understandable for people to be caught up in the myth of the "orient."
It is beyond me why, when they were supposed to be French, they didn't just hire real French actors and actresses - even if they then tried to speak English it would have been more authentic sounding.
The unscripted schpeel works for most small budget stuff like Jackass when it's actually unscripted, not fake like this.
Unfortunately, when 30 minutes was up, there were no final credits, and a quick info check on the TiVo revealed the show was actually a full hour.
As a child, my parents took me and my sister to the movies (this was the early 1950s) every week when the double-bill changed.
Years later, when the studios released their old film libraries to television, I discovered that, when she was younger, that same Joan Crawford was not only a first-rate actress ("Mildred Pierce") but when she was VERY young, naturally beautiful and vulnerable ("Grand Hotel").
When I became a member of the movie business (journalist, publicist), I loved hearing stories from the "old-timers" on film crews who had worked with the screen legends way back when.
When "Mommie Dearest" was made into a movie, I was invited to a press screening but skipped it when a friend of mine at Paramount told me it was utter garbage (I was never a Faye Dunaway fan anyway, finding her as cold and off-putting as the middle-aged Joan Crawford).
Based on Christina Crawford's "memoir," MOMMIE DEAREST focuses primarily on Crawford in the 1940s when she adopted a few children and was, at least briefly, considered a good actress.
It does reach a certain level of hysteria in the second half particularly when the 50-something Dunaway/Crawford replaces her ill 20-something daughter on a soap opera.
I have seen Mommie Dearest when I was younger, and I have to say it is one of the absolute worst movies ever!
); she has a swimming contest with her daughter than gloats when Christina loses, then Christina says it's not fair so Joan spanks her and locks her up in a pool house.
when she hangs her dresses on wire hangers Joan yells at her and beats her with a hanger (I don't care for wire hangers either, but my goodness!
We love to hate celebrities, we love it when the powerful and talented fall, we love tawdry stories of abuse perpetrated on helpless victims by the powerful, we love stories about horrible mothers, and especially about horrible WOMEN.
Not that the novel had any real literary merit, but at least it did provide some insight into Crawford's psyche and the reader was free to decide when creative license was taken.
The story begins as the movie star's career is in free fall at MGM in 1939 (when she was forced to film a true atrocity called "Ice Follies of 1939").
Frank Tashlin-directed chaos isn't very funny, and occasionally verges on ludicrous when it tries passing Lewis off as a sensitive soul (this is no stretch for Jerry, as he manages to turn even his baby lullabies into infantile showstoppers).
The high spot for me was when she suggested that she look for a flat of her own a few months down the line and he had a tantrum and got well and truly hammered.
Well, if you're interested, here's why not: This galling display of perversion is so caustic to the sensibilities of any thinking person that I cannot believe anyone was truly happy with the film when it was completed.
Worse, the life lessons she is supposedly learning clearly aren't sinking in if,after realizing her love interest is nothing but a lecherous, perverted, no talent, broke, lying loser who preys on naive, helpless girls when he exposes his intentions in LA at his former 'collector' friends' house, she happily goes along for the ride with only a little tantrum.
Jean Smart, as others here have mentioned, is a scene stealer when she gives Connie a piece of her prickly mind.
At least he didn't racially discriminate when choosing lovers; it was just the pesky age thing for him.
The cynical dialog of Harper's mother with Connie is for me the greatest part of this film, when she says that a looser like him prefers young and naive women to be admired in his completely failure as a man.
Ultimately, the photog turns out to be every bit as bad as he promises, and perhaps a little better since he's principled enough to send her away when it's at the point where the relationship can do nothing but drag her down.
I'm no expert but here's a tip: when showing a gritty, close up scene, try taking the camera off sticks and going hand-held to get an edgier, more nervous feel.
That's why I get nervous when I rent a sequel, because I don't know if it's going to be as good as Spider Man 2.
I wonder why they didn't bring up this difference when considering which of the devices they should attack, but I suppose that is asking for too much from a movie like this.
In the most unrealistic turn of an altogether unrealistic movie, as Lancaster battles inept soldiers trying to gun him down in the final scene, all animosity is quelled when the soldiers realize that he has staked roots *in this here land of THEIRS* by growing corn and siring a child - and they LEAVE HIM BE!
An early chase when Batgirl is abducted is superb, but it's the intense finale Â an extended sequence on Freeze's oil rig hideout Â that will blow you away.
The woman goes out to work leaving the man alone in the house, when suddenly, SHOCK HORROR!
When the credits rolled, i was wonderin when this "amazing" "masterpiece" film acclaimed by top movie critics was actually going to start lol !!.
23 minutes into the film and we were asking each other when it was going to start.
There are points in the film when you think, "what is the point of filming that", such as when Lexie is on the phone to her brother.
Lets see a Mexican handyman somehow winds up in Brads house to take cover when he could have stayed at the house he was working.
He knows there is toxic waste in the air but when in his house he waits long to seal it off.
Here's why...  A good film can be let down by a moment in the film when you, the viewer, don't believe (or buy) the characters' decisions or actions.
This happened in The Wrestler, when the main character 'forgot' to attend the dinner date that he had managed to arrange with his estranged daughter.
I found it unrealistic - so in love but when she first returns to the house he wouldn't let her in!
Even when the Handyman explains that it's worth the risk that he be with his wife & leaves, Brad is adamant his skin comes first, but concedes to sealing off a room so Lexi can come in out of the cold.
The end comes when the disease police gas the self-centered Brad, who finished up infected anyway, in his own "fort", & Lexi gets a 5 minute paramedic treatment & is told she'll survive.
He gets a burst tyre and turns into a garage, when he returns to his car the reports now say a dirty bomb was detonated.
Lexi goes to the hospital with the kid, soldiers in contamination suits come to the house when she's gone and take a sample of ash from when Lexi broke the window.
There was one moment throughout the whole movie when it evoked some emotion other then boredom and disgust, and that was when Lexi put her had through the back door and dropped the phone and contaminated ash in the house, i felt anger that she would do that to her husband who she supposedly loved (allthough i got no sense of any connection between her and her husband) i feel bad for the actors it was not there fault they got the parts, in fact i admire that they made the appalling script come to life, its not there fault it was badly written.
But when she throws a cell phone through a window, he just leaves the ash that comes in his home and does nothing about it.
Then when a bunch of ash gets thrown in (cell phone scene), he just leaves it there.
The twist, when it does come, comes too late.
Wow, it almost sounds action-packed when I type it out.
So, we now know there has been widespread contamination outside, we know that the wife was very close to the initial explosions when they happened downtown, we know that she has been exposed to this dust for days and we expect that she must now die.
I saw this just-about-perfect film when it screened at the Maryland Film Festival in May, 2005.
Already poor and unable to afford health insurance, the family is pushed past the breaking point when their young daughter suffers a swimming injury and needs surgery.
As the film progresses to the actual 'zombie invasion' (which, strangely, wasn't the first ten minutes when zombies were wandering all over campus), it only gets worse and worse.
The best scene is early on, when Bennett and one of her football players topple their canoe, and emerge soaking wet.
I felt that it was trying to show what would happen if women end up taking over the world (especially having Elizabeth I (a powerful queen) go forward in time that was 'futuristic' when the movie was made right after the women's rights movement of the 60s).
Nothing is more insulting to a viewer's intelligence than to be given cues as to when to react, especially when the people giving the cues are clearly much stupider than the average viewer.
And by the way, since when was it "bold" and "edgy" to say the same bad things about the president that everyone else is saying?
(1) Colbert is obviously a Democrat which shows quite quickly when you watch about 1 or 2 of these shows.
(3) The format got worn out very quickly when the Democrats took power, so the humor no longer takes chances or has a edge like when Bush & the Republicans had power.
I was bitter when I found out Kelly only repeated himself.
the story with the clown made me wonder if I washed my feet today... too bad, this truly is a movie to see while washing your feet, so you can do something useful when the torment begins.
the third part made me realize Kelly repeats himself over and over again, like a little child with a doll or when a kid becomes a teenager.
It centers around Barbara Gordon("Batgirl") who finds herself being the unlucky one that's kidnapped by Freeze when he finds out that she's an organ donor.
Really watch this if you haven't it ends with everyone on a happy note just like the days when you as a kid watched cartoons!
In fact, its post-modern detachment and minimalist animation (as well as the title) suggest that its target audience is young adolescents feeling their first stirrings of rebellion and puberty, a time when even the most commonplace, unsophisticated vulgarity can seem forbidden, hilarious and daring.
But when it's stretched out over an almost 90 minute time period it feels like a 5 year old child with A.D.D.
He even has a gas gun that shoots small gas pellets and when they hit the target they merely disable.
It becomes down right hokey near the end when  (SPOILER WARNING)  the main character's father suffers a heart attack and is being rushed to the hospital and the young man is chasing after it...Then we have the zoo incident.
Some of the film's setups must be deemed as intentionally, in addition to symbolically, grotesque, and there are too many instances when both logic and continuity go begging.
The film was at it's most interesting when it went into 'conspiracy theory' territory.
Zombies disintegrate when lit on fire.
Since when can zombies use tools?
Let's start with an important disclaimer - I'm pretty generous when it comes to scoring a film.
My personal favorite is the wall-scaling spider zombies, which move about with superhuman speed... ofc except when attempting a go at our protagonists.
The only thing that saved this movie from making me really angry was the fact that I had it recorded it on DVR and I could fast forward through most of it and then have the satisfaction of hitting 'DELETE' when it was over.
Remember when the DOTD remake came out and most of us all spat at the idea saying what a travesty?
Now, there are a fair few out there who didn't like the idea of running zombies when DOTD remake came out.
I can't say how disappointed i was when i saw this.
In reality, I have just one question for the producers: What the hell were you thinking when you made this abomination?
i am one of the most forgiving viewers when it comes to horror, i actually like really bad films.
however, when a film tries so hard to be serious, but winds up being one of the most ridiculously awful, messy pieces of garbage ever committed to film, i have to give it 1 star!
Like many of you, I got really excited when I heard about this film.
What he was thinking when he directed the Day of the Dead redux is beyond me.
The director surely mustn't of been a big fan of this genre when he signed up for it.
Also, if you want a sure shot at ruining your movie just cast Nick Cannon in any part and he will say ridiculous lines like "by the power or gray skull" or some random curse word when he kills his hundredth zombie because apparently he is a super zombie killer as soon as the outbreak occurs.
The same thing happened with Busta Rhymes in Halloween Resurrection when he said "Trick or Treat Motha F*@#*$."
The zombie's in this film must have been bitten by radioactive zombie spiders because they develop powers very similar to spider-man when they turn.
- only when you consider the moronic idiocy of immature college students trying to impress.
Hard to concentrate, however, when a lousy punk band rents out some space in their apartment building and jams constantly as his overdue rent builds up and bills come flying in.
The second thing i've noticed is that while some films used a lot of day for night shots where they attempt to convince you that it's nighttime when it's obviously daylight, and that's pretty stupid.
We then have 45 minutes of pointlessness such as a band moving in, the main characters talking about how they need money, and the guy complaining about noise and how his girlfriend won't shut up about when is the painting going to be done.
I especially liked it when the DK approaches a drunken middle-ager in the dead of night, revving his drill.
True, when the disgruntled artist Reno(played by first-time director Abel Ferrara) first goes on a rampage armed with a drill and 'porto-pak', the film does manage to touch a raw nerve, but soon it descends to laboriously-paced repetition and struggles to hold attention.
So when someone in the movie gets hit in the head you feel like you are watching roadrunner, except this isn't funny.
You know you're in trouble when you're watching a Jackie Chan movie & 20 minutes in there still isn't a fight.
It seems that every night Begnini dreams about marrying a lady and when he finally sees this woman (Nicoletta Braschi) in real life, he stalks her!
This TV film is based correctly on historical events developed in April 19,1775 , beginning hostilities for a shot was fired and starting the American Revolution, skirmishes among the British troops and the colonial militia were in Lexington and Concorde(Massachusetts); the deeds are the following : The first battle of the American War of Independence was in Lexington,northwest of Boston.Anticipating a rebellion ,The British general Thomas Gage sent 800 troops to seize stores at Concord and arrest John Hancock and John Adams ,two prominent American rebels.The rebellious were warned by Paul Revere(Vlasta Vrana).An advance party under Major Pitcairn encountered a party of about 50 Minutemen ,American rebel militia troops,on Lexington Common.They refused to disperse when ordered to do so,and Pitcairn ordered his troops to open fire.
And when it's all said and done, the Shakespeare content is pretty weak.
However, Friar Lawrence is not the wise caring character I associate him with, and I do not know why the Nurse was omitted when she provides the most effective source of parental love in the play.
I saw this film in 1996 when I was in an English lesson at school.
Nathan starts to feel the effects of his zombification when he starts to feel impervious to pain and feels hungry all the time.
His 2 pals, Henry and Diggs (Laurence Kinlan and Tadhg Murphy) who at times seem even less shiftless than their dead friend, get worried when they see Nathan's disenchantment with Jessica vanish.
However, the gore starts of perfunctory, not exactly a good sign when it takes almost half the movie to get there.
As the movie is a relatively short enterprise, clocking in at about 77 minutes (including credits), it almost makes up for the lack of spilled blood and guts when the horror aspect of the film finally kicks in.
What it does achieve is a quick and harmless way to spend just over an hour when bored.
What were Jenkins and Steenburgen thinking when they decided to be in this movie?
Unfortunately, the jokes and ideas these two grown up men have used to be funny when I was twelve.
The plot thickens when Dale shacks up with Derek's wife.
It's clear that there is a story trying to happen here, but when you have dialogue about wanting someone to crawl into your vagina and live there, well, it's a bit hard to let it blossom.
The anguish displayed on his face when he finally garners enough courage to ask Dorothy (Dee Hepburn) for a date, just as she enters the shower room is pure, teen-age angst!
Even better is his feigned indifference when he realizes Dorothy stands him up, while waiting beneath the huge clock at the union.
Dee Hepburn's performance as Dorothy displays the same infuriating ambivalence any boy has experienced when asking out a girl, he truly knows is indifferent to him.
Just when you think things have to get better, they get worse.
The main problem will come when they start to shake their parents' wedding.
The two despise each other at first, but eventually become friends, especially when their parents grow tired of their immaturity and force them to try and get jobs.
The only breakout moment is when Worrell tells Wakeman that he thinks of a keyboard as a woman that he's having sex with and Wakeman responds, 'I tried that but I found that the songs became very short.'
I agree with other reviewers in that Walter/Wendy Carlos was only briefly mentioned during this documentary, especially when it applies to the Moog modular system (as recorded on Switched-On Bach, The Well-Tempered Synthesizer, Switched-On Brandenburgs, Tron and others) which were perhaps the first and most influential recordings of the Moog synthesizer of all time.
I also agree that certain comments were repeated, especially Bob's comment on having a feel of what was going on within the Moog's circuitry when he played it.
Actually, much of the footage is somewhat comical in nature when you look back at how it was presented, back in the early days of synthesis.
Perhaps he was on such a low budget that he couldn't afford certain rights but when Bob Moog talks about 'Switched on Bach' as being a ground breaking album, changing the public perception of what electronic music could offer, there isn't one single note from the album played.
Favourite scene follows favourite scene - when Gregory walks in front of a car, his father is the driving instructor, when Gregory lies on the ground with "not" Gregory's Girl, held onto the surface of the earth by "the mysterious force of gravity", the boys out taking photos of a nurse undressing using so many elephants at F8, Gregory spraying deodorant onto his shirt, his friend the expert chef, etc.
not sure but just a warning so I can let my mind wander without worrying about it)  I watched this when it first came out and recorded it for the heck of it later.
If you are a Knight Rider fan waiting to see this movie you will know what I mean when you see it.
As with most British movies, it's shot like crap but you know, it really doesn't matter when the script and the performances complement one another so well.
I've grown up with it and still find something to smile about every time, much the same way that I do when listening to Jonathan Richman's mid-80's albums Rockin and Romance and Jonathan Sings.
The 80's series was a classic even though I do think that David Hasselhoff is an absolutely shambolic actor, which really comes through when he plays two roles in the episodes "Goliath" and "Goliath Returns".
It essentially hasn't hardly got anything to do with the concept and original idea of Knight Rider, until right at the end, (at which time I was falling in and out of sleep), when they build a car with armour and weapons on it.
It wasn't improved by the fact I was in a bad mood when I watched it, but still, they could have done much better than this.
The soft ending is a major disappointment too, when this picture desperately needed a hard-hitting finale to drive home a point, one Mr. Gyllenhaal's film never had to make in the first place.
Should black and white mix when it comes to raising children?
Indiana Jones, Hellboy, Men In Black, Lara Croft Tomb Raider (video game and movie) The Medalion, Monk, Witchblade, Kill Bill (with the music that played when the two girls started fighting,) Lord of the Rings, and countless of other films were constantly being ripped off by this piece of crap.
Did she decline one when she saw how bad the film was?
The main reason I'm posting this comment is point out that there are NO NUDE scenes featuring the femme fatal Christina app legate so if you mistook the R-rating,and the cover showing Appplegate pole-dancing as an implication that you're gonna see a "money shot" then do yourself a favor, don't make the same mistake I did when it first came out and don't bother renting it.
Watching 'Gregory's Girl' for the first time in over two decades, one is immediately struck by reminders of when it was made: the grainy film, the dreadful soundtrack, the big hair of both its male and female characters.
For at its heart, Bill Forsyth's film captures two eternal realities, the (potentially charming) essential uselessness of a certain sort of teenage male, and the particular uselessness of just about all males when confronted by a sufficiently pretty girl (Dee Hepburn, although Clare Grogan, later a pop star, appears in a secondary role).
In 1916, when he switched to Mutual Studios, his films once again improved and he became the more recognizable nice guy--in many of the previous films he was just a jerk (either getting drunk a lot, beating up women, provoking fights with innocent people, etc.).
It's like my cable lineup is the all Frasier channel, all the time, then, when Frasier is over, Becker reruns.
I hate it when American sitcoms show characters who have such an easy life.
She's had a history of loser lovers and when you watch her you aren't going to be very surprised about that.
This movie seemed to be almost constantly when I was around seven, and at the time I remember it being totally scary and engrossing.
Throughout the movie, there is all this talk about how much work the house needs, saying at one point that a dinner party there will be like "eating in the subway," when all of this is utterly belied by the house itself, which is spectacular.
), which makes it surprising that she doesn't seem phased in the least when, at the height of her nervousness, the lights in the bathroom go out while she's taking a shower.
The biggest example of this is all the talk about the house being a wreck, when it's clearly ready for Architectural Digest, and there are other little instances where someone will talk abut something that never happened or whatever.
Beth's Mother is a harsh dictator who rules with a iron fist, and when Beth turns to her when it appears that she can't put together the marriage she wants in time for Christmas Eve (long story) she brings the fist down on Beth.
Wastes the first hour wandering about plot-wise, then when the Mother is introduced, she is impossibly harsh (so harsh that the plot device of Beth asking for her help isn't believable, an elopement (or suicide) would have been more believable (and quicker!))
What do you get when you cross legendary action choreographer Yuen Woo-ping (here directing rather than choreographing) with the plot of Speed 2, a bland leading man, an immensely irritating leading lady, an obnoxious and untalented child actress and some tired and uninspired action scenes?
It's kind of an empty story when all is said and done.
The deaths, when they do arrive, are uninspired, consisting of one tedious, unconvincing stabbing after another, leaving one longing for something a little more creative (is it too much to ask for our killer to make an effort?).
Things change with the introduction of Dorothy (Hepburn), a girl that stumbles into Gregory's world when it appears she wants to be a member of the football team.
Despite this, football and football practise will take on a more important role for him with Dorothy's introduction to the team when the two items he's interested in most clash.
So when they get naked, it's like, "Who cares?"
The idea of student returning to the same house where her family was killed when she was young (with the student having a psychic bond with the killer) is simply too stupid for words, so I'll leave it at that.
However things take a turn for the worse almost immediately when Beth starts to suffer from graphic & terrifying dreams & hallucinations.
Still, I'd watch this movie again and again, it's as good as any horror spoof even though we're not supposed to snigger when one of the girls gets butchered and her stud boyfriend runs into the house naked except for some sneakers and cheesy white socks, sprouting, in a deep jock voice with twitching eyebrows "Some guy just killed Tracy"...Classic!!!
Amnesia is one thing but its plain ridiculous that one cant remember something that life changing even when they were 5 years old.
Not to say I expected Shakespeare when I watched this rubbish.
The money shot occurs when the murderer is coming after the sorority girls, falls two stories off a ladder, then is able to spontaneously crash through the window minutes later.
What is most unique is that when I voted on this movie, the most votes were 10s and 1s.
They also knew when to hit the breaks, and take their money out in time first: Insider Information.
This documentary will be frustrating to anyone who is already done with the US war policy, but it will help assuage those not yet ready to admit they made a mistake when they voted for Bush.
You know, the way Bill O'Reilly or Rush Limbaugh do when someone calls in with an intelligent argument.
Wilson figures his own deceptive practices can be excused by admitting them, but when you're out to slam someone else for doing the same thing, one should practice what one preaches.
And when he goes under the Dimholt he REALLY summons the dead.
A similarly tacky piece of directing occurs when the elves appear - the soft focus lens is deployed with 'celtic' singing.
The story flopped all over the place, with Saruman's storyline simply chopped off and left unresolved, while Jackson wasted time indulging in invented scenes back in Rohan, when the story should have moved decisively to Gondor.
Tolkien's whole theme was that adventure and crisis are NOT the sole property of noble heroes, but that it can touch anyone, and how we react when it does is as important as Aragorn's struggle with Sauron or Denethor's descent into madness.
Favourite bits - probably the little moments that you only spot after repeated viewings; when the teachers spot Gregory weaving across the empty playground when he's late for school - "does he think he's invisible?!
Especially when the gals are matched with an odd assortment of young male actors who had somehow avoided the draft long enough to appear on this 1942 set.
They explain that when an African was ripped from his family and from his community by Europeans, this was awful, awful, awful.
But when Muslims ripped an African from his family and his community, he just became a member of a new family.
One day, Papini storms in her office without her permission and asks her why she didn't kill him when she had the chance.
The state of horror films today is truly sad when a disaster like this is more effective than 90% of all horrors films made today.
The effective moments come out of nowhere: when someone takes his shoe off...didn't expect that!
There is very little, in fact none, blood or gore in the film until the last 10 minutes or so when the red stuff is splashed everywhere.
They would probably mistake a typewriter and a TV set for a computer when faced with those.
Their inanity can be seen best when the killer sends dr Hudson an e-mail with a video clip attached.
And when he finally gets his dream date with Dorothy and is lead from pillar to post, by first one girl then another he takes it all in his stride.
and yet despite being made 7 years on (when effects have supposed to have improved) 'The deadly spawn' makes this film look like a college exam entry.
You can't hide chuckling when you see another stupid character running straight into the creature's mouth or.
I had the misfortune of seeing this trash when I was in college, and my test scores immediately dropped by 10 points across the board.
Just when you're thinking of the worst movies you've ever seen, along comes this grade Z clunker zooming into the frame!
I first saw Gregory's Girl shortly after it was released, when I was an awkward and shy teenager myself.
And then when he goes into hypnosis and describes himself as a Jewish woman in World War II Poland.
The one decent line in this episode is spoken by Scully when she talks about that she "could've done without the Flukeman thing".
One last question to the writers of this episode, Glen Morgan & James Wong: What were you smoking when you wrote this episode and why didn't you share?
I guess when you win you win and when you lose you lose.
But, I suppose, when someone makes a film THIS bad, all the studio can do is make up a really cool name for it and hope that somebody buys it by mistake.
And then life imitated art, when Mandy started seeing hunky arrogant bad boy tennis player Andy Roddick.
And just when you think the film will deliver a laugh or an insight, all it can manage is one of those cheap, spur-of-the moment comments that kids make up in the hallway between classes when there really isn't any time to think things through.
I must say that I was incredibly disappointed when I saw this film.
Actually, when Halley would do a total 180 between scenes, my friend and I joked whether they pulled the scene from novel one or novel two.
For example, you know a film is struggling when they have a dog hump one of the principle character's legs.
Toward the end when the boyfriend avoids her for a while, it was merely yawn-inducing.
In particular, when the boyfriend forced his way on to the radio station's air waves as though he had to do something desperate and gritty to get Halley's attention, I wondered why he hadn't thought to simply go to her house or call her on the phone.
Helen Chandler and David Manners, as the lovers whose romance is rudely interrupted when Dracula bites her on the neck, are as bland as you like and fail to make you care about them.
(Although he also yells something at Van Helsing)Preys on Lucy only when asleep and/or sleepwalking.
I love Melissa Bank's sophisticated, complex, moving fiction and I was very curious when I heard that some of the stories in her first novel/short story collection were being made into a movie.
It tries to be powerful, but why should I care when I still don't know the names of the characters, let alone their motivations.
Apparently when being shot at from all directions, you will be magically protected by violin music.
What an anti climax when 'grease' came on while my mind kept flashing back to the wonderful ,previous film i had watched before.
We soon learn that Alby was bossy and cruel to Elias when they were children, and his pre-adolescent ribbing continues as they attempt to get acquainted as adults.
Of course if you worked in a German homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how Europe is the "Continent of Plenty" when it comes to sophistication.
I made the mistake of watching this disaster two days after watching The Passion of the Christ, arguably one of the most powerful religious films ever made, so when I saw Jesus with fangs in this movie I almost fell over backwards at the sheer, overwhelming dumbness of it all.
I was disappointed when I purchased this on DVD.
I assumed when I saw the disc available that it was the sequel to "Ninja Scroll", and thus not happy when I found out it wasn't.
So, when his circumstances improve, his persona is unchanged.
Now I am aware that one shouldn't anticipate much when selecting a movie directed by the notoriously incompetent director Al Adamson (his other "highlights" include 'Blood of Dracula's Castle', 'Satan's Sadists' and 'Brain of Blood') but this worthless excuse for a motion picture is literally insufferable.
I saw this on TV, and when coming back from commercial breaks, I frequently thought that I was watching a different film entirely.
It's bad enough when a movie "seems"to drag on because it's so bad.
I saw this movie at a film festival when it first came out and, after skipping over it at the local library for the last nine months, finally borrowed it on loan to see what my younger roommate would think of it and to view it again myself, nearly a decade later.
If you think I am wrong, ask your female friends how much they like it when their ex turns up in the middle of their shift in front of their workmates to try and get back together.
The songs are fine but nothing very memorable and we really don't get a feeling that Alice has learned anything when it's all over(I guess I'm not sure if this was the author's intention but we see this in the Disney version).
One of my childhood best loved films which I was not disappointed with when I watched it recently.
Jobe agreed to it, and slowly he shows good improvement in intelligence, but of course it turns into a Frankenstein theme when he develops the ability to move objects, his voice sounds more like a computer, and he has turned evil.
I say "supposedly" because when he saw what they did to his book, King demanded his name be removed from any association of this film!
I also wonder if Pierce Brosnan ever looks back and winces when he recalls being the star of this film?
We've all probably been in the situations Gregory finds himself in during the movie and this just brings it all back... playing football in the school team (and chatting nonchalently to spectators when should have been keeping an eye on players bearing down on goal), getting into scrapes with teachers and of course that first date with the girl of your dreams.
Gregory's sister is the one with the fashion sense and is the guiding hand in trying to sort out his love life while its Gregory who is the petulant immature one when confronted by his sisters' young admirer at the front door.
Yet every word spoken by the main characters is crystal clear ... including when the surveillance camera is recording them from a considerable distance, such as in a parking lot or food court, where a number of other people are, but for some reason, the camera doesn't pick up a peep from them, but somehow zeroes in on whatever the leads utter.
And when we cut between cameras during the same scene, the audio is uninterrupted.
Jokes are constantly made at their expense--THREE times we see one member go hysterical when he breaks his nails!
The cover tell you about all the extra-material and such, but when you launch the extra material in the extra annoying and slow interface, all you get is: "You need a computer with Windows and a DVD-drive to use the extra-materials".
Unfortunately I think it ended this franchise when it really should have spring-boarded a series of movies had it been done with more thought.
The horribly conceived "it's time to grow up" moment in question though is when Sam (Shane Powers), a friend of Jacksons, kills himself because he's also secretly in love with him!
Made at the time when video shops were appearing by the dozen in high streets all over the UK "Gregory's Girl" was a definite "must hire" for any schoolboy who had ever gazed longingly and hopelessly at some unattainable figure in the playground whilst she totally blanks him and chats unconcernedly to her mates,not knowing she carries his heart in her hands.It is at the same time an evocation of the sweet pain and joy of adolescent love and a grand comedy of young manners.
One more thing, when the monster is looking for some eye's for itself how can it see where it's going or who it's kidnapping & why are there eye holes cut into the bandage's around the bucket, erm sorry head, so it can 'see'?
When Jolie hears of it he kills him when he hits the wolf just a little too hard and his head strikes a cement curb.
Of course when Jolie hears about in prison he's all for it, but not for her taking up their kid as well.
Yet Jolson's dynamism as an entertainer still shines through and when he's singing you almost forget about the plot.
In this 2-parter, David Jason plays the character of a old WWII seaman who is called in by the Navy when his submarine re-emerges after disappearing in the war.
Only David Jason's 'Jack Hardy' survives from the original crew but he suffers from memory loss, and has to piece together his movements from a series of flashbacks when taken back inside the ship.
The story then becomes laughable when the Navy decide, for some reason, to re-enact the last voyage of the Submarine by piecing together the movements from the Captain's Log.
I wouldn't attack the plot too much because after all it is called 'Ghostboat' and so you expect it to be a little far fetched/supernatural so that's fine BUT... at the end when the Navy and the Russian Navy (or whatever they're called in Russia) closed the case on the strange goings on, there was no mention of and never any mention of, all the other boats they blew up along the way...and as for the hostile German aircrafts...well I can only assume that they were imagined?
With David Jason as the lead and also one of the producers, I expected a lot more than I got when watching this.
To paraphrase Rudyard Kipling:   "If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs  and blaming it on you ... chances are you haven't grasped the  situation! "
Well, when this baby finally hit screens at the Mill Valley Film Festival, I was surprised to find my suspicions had been correct: no amount of editing or re-packaging was gonna polish this turd.
John Gordon Sinclair and Dee Hepburn were absolutely wonderful in this story of teenage love and the sudden twists & turns that occur when you think you've met THE ONE, but then someone else...
Scientists revive the spy and try to get that memory from his amnesiac mind with a holographic device that can see inside the man's mind when he's sleeping.
Also our trade pundits, should take a notice about the kind of stuff Director David Dhawan is capable of delivering when both of his regular writers- Anees Bazmee and Rumi Jaffrey are not with him.
Director Kunal Kohli said he find it very insulting when he is not permitted in for the premiere of this film.
2.If you thought that you could at least see six hotties (Ayesha, Esha, Soha, Arti, Sophie & Riya) then you won't get to see much of them.And when you'll get back home you won't even remember if there was one Miss Riya Sen (or some other actress) in the film.
Sure there's some blood and gore, but when an entire movie comes of like a goof, how on earth can it be shocking?
Necrophilia, strange homosexual rape, and incest are not punchlines when you take them as seriously as the makers of this film.
Ollie Kendall's Houseboat Horror achieved a similar kind of feat when that too took a one-way vacation into obscurity.
But Kendall's admittedly poor splatter cheese fest looks comparable to Oliver Stone's JFK when levelled up against this dire mess.
At first Dorothy responds to Gregory's ardour with polite indifference, but when he asks her for a date, she accepts.
It made a refreshing change from American high school movies which, then as now, generally used established actors in their late twenties or even thirties; the unkind joke about Stockard Channing's character in "Grease" was that she would leave school when she passed her exams or had her menopause, whichever happened first.
I was at university when I saw this film in the cinema in 1981, having left school two years earlier.
Oh, and those awful "everything fits perfectly" parts of the plot: mom appears at the ball exactly when she has to, perfectly dressed for the occasion; sudden boyfriend Ian is ubiquitous and has 'chosen' to perform all kinds of low-profile jobs, although he attended the best schools and therefore (very convenient) has at least a piece of the necessary substratum to be rightfully considered a peer by "Britain's snobbish upper class"; etc.
"A space mission goes awry when the experimental rocket malfunctions, forcing the astronaut to eject in an escape capsule an sending the rocket into deep space, where it explodes.
Space flight experimentation goes awry when a missile to the moon explodes and causes asteroids to be thrown into a path toward Earth.
Stock footage is the norm and the dialog is corny, but there is a bright shining moment when they know they are all doomed and some scientist wigs out.
I was on an overnight pass from the Army in 1969 when this movie was playing.
), I about had it when the film attempted to romanticize Douglas' comically loud-mouthed brute of a father.
Gregory's Girl makes me laugh every few seconds, and the only mention of a bodily excretion I can remember is Andy's "chat up line" in the school cafeteria: "Did you know that when you sneeze, it comes out of your nose at a 100 miles an hour?"
The personnel in The Arrangement reminds me of the LA Lakers basketball team ( around the time this film was made) when they had Hall of Famers Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West and Elgin Baylor on the same squad.
In the early 60s he was still producing quality work (Splendor in the Grass, America,America) when he turned to writing a best seller (The Arrangement) eventually bringing it to the screen in the late sixties.
Harvey Thew's screenplay has a decent number of double entendres but is surprisingly restrained with the homoerotic subtext--especially when Fay is discovered in bed with James Gleason!
Seriously, my dog is a better source of comedy when it is asleep!
Ugh...I can watch most of what LMN puts on when the wife has the remote but I walked out on this unrealistic debacle.
I thought it was going to be an honest look at the way a family changes when something like this happens to a parent, my family went through something similar when I was growing up, so to see someone like Harrison Ford take on this topic was something I really wanted to see.
The film has few redeeming features, but the main one is that it is quite a good laugh to watch with a few mates when drunk, especially at the hilarious musical score and the cheap and nasty production values, (at one point it actually switches from widescreen to normal, then back to widescreen a few minutes later).
He sports some rather unwieldy protective clothing which he clearly didn't wear during rehearsals (assuming they did any) as he bumps into a pot plant when he exits.
He also has some of the worst lines in the movie: "I was in a motel room when I got this call.
Then neighborhood is in shambles and the Prostitute or the dope fiend at the corner is his ex girlfriend who left when he ran out of town.
when in the script was just added to the his singing.
OK, so this is Jack Ryan before Patriot Games (given that he's unmarried ... the movie is unclear on the time when it's set), so he has to be young, but Harrison Ford managed to portray Ryan as a nice guy, insecure but fundamentally smart, and Affleck just can't do it.
Frederick Forsyth has the same problem when transferred onto the big screen - although at least Freddy is plausible and has some real experience with what he writes about.
Perhaps young Jack can read it for himself when he gets a bit older.
However, when a movie purports to have some connection to the reality of current affairs, and it turns out to be no more realistic than the Itchy and Scratchy Show I get annoyed.
Let me preface my comments by saying that I loved Clancy's book when I first read it ten years ago.
Clancy seemed to know that when he wrote the book; he seems to have forgotten it here though.
The only redeeming qualities to this film were the nice cinematography and the awesome sound when the big bomb went off.
I read the book "The Sum of All Fears" with fascination--Palestenians discover an Isreali nuclear device lost when the aircraft is shot down in the six day war, sell it to Al Queda, and the arab terrorists proceed to blow up Denver with said nuke.
He sports some rather unwieldy protective clothing which he clearly didn't wear during rehearsals (assuming they did any) as he bumps into a pot plant when he exits.
He also has some of the worst lines in the movie: "I was in a motel room when I got this call.
The only reason I would ever recommend this film is so you can laugh at the hilariously out-of-place scene involving the fat ethnic kid who can communicate with the dead when he rides in a fast car and blasts rap music loud enough.
There's also the moments when Jake tattoos people, they just sit down in his chair & the goes to work, they never say what they want or where they want it & then these people just get up & walk out without paying, I'm not being funny but if I was having a tattoo (which would be for life) then I'd at least want to pick the design & where it was going.
The dream actually becomes reality when one morning there's a naked horseman at their door.
The film was made at the end of the Franco era in Spain when overt sexuality was a no-no on the generalissimo's cinema screen and might have simply been an attempt to make a cheap little sex thriller with a cast of about eight people, and on that level it isn't bad.
I have the video of this film, and I watched it when I was younger, but out of all the Lassie films, this is my least favourite and a film that I could not get into.
The film only became interesting when the doctor had to go out in rough weather on a house call, and he is knocked off his horse.
But it has its moments,my favorite is when zoltan hound of Dracula hopes out of his own dog sized coffin!!
!i found this film on videocassette from local goodwill.hard shell case release from EMI .SWeet,the dog seems scary when they shine lights into its eyes,thats about the only special effect I saw hahaa,a cult classic in the making,lets see it has to be ten lines, well this was a turd of a film but gave me hope that I could create an Indy film better than this and release it.Wow, how did they ever get the green light on this turd.though the dog is a nice looking dog.I jsust cant picture a studio exec saying wow this is a truly gripping film.Was it put out asa joke?
But most of all, you will figure out who the murderer is, and you will be satisfied when they get their comeuppance.
Of course, neither of those is odd, really, it seems to me a logical occurrence when you leave newborn puppies out in the wilderness all night, and howling is just something dogs do.
I mean, why would vampires continue to make other vampires, doomed to live in darkness and drink blood, when the Veidt Smiths of the world get to roam around carefree AND get to live forever?
Zoltan's eyes glow white almost all the time, except when they are uniformly black, that is.
Dragged into the plot are a hapless wanderer who stumbles upon the dreaded hearse of Veidt Smith, and two amiable fishermen who are so laid-back that they don't even feel threatened when their dog goes ballistic and takes off into the woods suddenly in the middle of the night.
Now Galactic Gigolo isn't great, but it has its moments and can be enjoyed when you are desperate for more from the people who brought you Psychos in Love.
He sports some rather unwieldy protective clothing which he clearly didn't wear during rehearsals (assuming they did any) as he bumps into a pot plant when he exits.
He also has some of the worst lines in the movie: "I was in a motel room when I got this call.
Though most are vulgar there are moments when the vigilantes seem to be coercing men in order to find them guilty and deserving of death.
The girls tell each other it's time to get naked, whine when they get blood on their shoes and fight over who gets to kill who.
Later that night Josephine has a heart attack in her room and dies, this is when Sister Gertrude steals the ring.
Anita Ekberg made this film in the late 1970s, just when her career was in dire need of a boost.
Unsurprisingly, the film is most memorable when it goes over-the-top Â such as the irate Ekberg crushing an old patient's dentures under her feet (with the latter expiring soon after!
I am an airplane buff so I notice when things don't match up in films involving airplanes, but anyone can see that the different shots of the plane in this film are clearly of several different airlines, and the shot of the plane taking off is actually a plane landing.
I remember watching it on TV when I was younger and thinking it reminded me of an Agatha Christie story on an airplane, and that's basically what it is.
On an interesting note, the stewardess uniforms that Brooke Adams and Farrah Fawcett are wearing were actual uniforms for TWA and can also be seen in 'Catch Me if You Can' at the end when Leonardo DiCaprio climbs out of the plane through the toilet.
We need an Arabic translation of this film, so that when we capture Osama bin Laden, we can prop his eyelids open with toothpicks and force him to watch it over and over again - yes, there is a cruel and unusual punishment worse than death.
I can just imagine the TV execs of the day sitting around smoking pot and "brainstorming", when suddenly one them stands from his seat and announces, "Let's make a show about a bunch of people on an airplane!
Long gone are the days when idiot proof plots and acting like this would engross a nation wide TV viewing audience.
I hope that when the producers shot this movie, they didn't have the intention too make a serious, good movie.
Trust me, when you see it you'll know.
This is the kind of movie you scoff at when you see the trailers on TV for it's theatrical run.
You pass it by without a thought when you're browsing Blockbuster Video on a Friday night.
But one day you'll be flipping aimlessly through your cable movie channels and that's when this movie will get you.
But then what else would you expect when it stars Dennis Rodman?
-- to show him eating, or shaking his bountiful belly, or wanting to eat...until, of course, at the movie's climax, when he (or, rather, a stunt double) suddenly turns kick-boxing action star.
Said scene provides the single most unintentionally funny moments: try holding back the laughs when it's obvious Pinette's double is only about 6 inches taller and 100 pounds lighter (despite the padding), and watch as a baddie is kicked over a bridge and actually SLOWS as he falls, thanks not to slow-mo but to the bungie cord.
Besides beating the crap out of Rodman, she did have some nice fight scenes with other characters in the movie (especially when she was fighting against Rodman and the bodygaurd to the villain in the movie).
I was glad when Rodman's enemy/girldfriend, in the movie, kicked him in the face and shut him up.
Next time I will go rent a movie or read a book, when there's nothing on television.
I remember I was vacationing in Nags Head, North Carolina when Cinemax started airing ads for the film and presenting it as some kind of "great film."
I had very low expectations when I went in to this movie.
He always smiles, makes little jokes only he laughs about and gets scared the first time when his car is blocked by a sheep's herd.
And when you succeed in watching the movie in full length without running away, you can be sure to feel as crazy as the whole crew must have felt to make this film.
Who wants to cry anyway when you just as well can become crazy?
It's Mr. No Legs job to keep D'Angelo's drug business running smoothly so when one of his drug pushers Ken Wilson accidentally kills his girlfriend Tina when she discovers a load of D'Angelo's heroin in his apartment Mr. No Legs decides to just kill Ken as well & dump both of their bodies.
Unfortunately Mr. No Legs didn't count on the fact that Tina's Brother Andy (Ted Vollrath) is in fact a cop with the local department, Andy & his partner Chuck (Richard Jaeckel) set about discovering Tina's killer & that means getting close to D'Angelo's drug operations which Mr. No Legs isn't happy about & believe me you don't want to make Mr. No Legs angry as I doubt you would like him when he's angry...
I don't know why but I always thought Mr. No Legs would be the hero, you know fighting against all the odds & defeating all the bad guys in his fully equipped wheelchair & when he turned out to be the bad guy I was a bit surprised as I think the film would have worked better with him as someone to root for.
My favourite scene in the film is when Mr. No Legs is facing up to someone who wants to kill him, Mr. No Legs climbs out of his chair & puts his fists up to the guy even though without legs Mr. No Legs doesn't reach past his waist!
Seriously I`m certain he has because the sound mix after this scene is all over the place , when someone speaks the volume of their voice increases/decreases from shot to shot and there`s also plenty of scenes with obvious overdubbing , and not to mention bizarre background noises .
During the epic battle, scale disappears, and the pipe-organ (which they fight on) changes size and hight several times, particularly when they are falling past it.
That's the typical salad bowl martial arts movie from the early 70's, when hong kong low budget movies were the new wave in cheap entertainment.
Even though when I buy a film like this I don't really expect good acting, story, or quality I buy them anyway just in case there is some good fighting / scenes in there.
Men suffer, you know, when their children die; but they can get through it by squaring their jaws and drinking liquor.
I agree with others when stating that this movie needed more No Legs and less police procedural: The squandered opportunity of a sequel examining how No Legs arrived at his legless state, came to grips with his disabilities and got his start as a hit-man is one of the great lost cult gems that was never made.
For just like the act of gambling itself, or indeed, not unlike the Air Bud movies, Owning Mahowny seems enticing at first, that is, when you and your friends are just planning to see it, joking that you might strike big, that this might be the one movie that comes out of nowhere to surprise you, but then from the moment you enter the theatre, every time you give this movie a chance, it's just one bad hand after the other, until eventually you are completely numb to it, and you stop paying attention to your wife, and you start cutting out of work early, and you no longer enjoy anything again in life anymore because all you want is your Owning Mahowny.
when the letters are rearranged and a question mark is inserted, which is a lazy anagram at best as it only requires two permutations.
The protagonist is never shown to have a single redeeming quality, except possibly in the end, when he tells his girlfriend "I love you too" and kisses her hand, and this is supposed to make up for the fact that she has always come in a strong second to his addiction.
Who are they I thought when they started their hilarious and vulgar orations?
The movie contains about 50 scenes where you know that in 2 seconds time, there will be a BOOOO effect and when it comes you do not get scared rather angry that you actually paid money to watch this rubbish.
Then, later, it takes forever for the water to drain past her nose when her magic toes pull up the plug.
I just want to emphasize -- I hate when Ghosts are portrayed as The Riddler's character in the Batman series - as simple clue-givers.
The love scenes couldn't have had less chemistry, with their contrived spontaneity, and clumsy ripping-off of clothing, and the constant comparison of Hillary Swank's character and Mia Kirshner's character who were supposed to bear an uncanny resemblance to each other in the film, when in reality they look absolutely nothing alike.
Or, when poor cop Josh Hartnett and socialite Hillary Swank engage in carnal relations in a seedy motel, and afterwards, as he, sitting in bed, is lighting up cigarettes for the two of them while she cuddles near him, is still wearing his fedora while she still wears her pearls.
Though the movie begins to drag when it for too long replaces mystery with romance, the film does have one really good scene of unrelenting Hitchcock-like suspense.
This device was previously used for almost an entire film by Robert Montgomery (Elizabeth's dad) when he played Philip Marlowe in "Lady in the Lake."
I had been intrigued about the Elizabeth Short murder a couple of weeks ago when the Sunday paper I read had an insert that was a reprint from 1947 about the killing of the Black Dahlia.
SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE THE DEAD GIRL, YOUR THE SICK ONE-- has got to be the funniest line that was not intended to be funny in the whole movie- I laughed, along with the rest of the theater, for about 2 minutes after that-- and then when the Voice Over comes on and its SCARElett's voice repeating it again, I just could not contain my laughter anymore!
It was like the director thought the movie was too long so he just threw everything in at once to tie up loose ends, when all it does is create more questions then answers.
Will the Black Dahila murder be solved, will the good guys prevail, will Josh Hartnett learn to act, will the scenery hold up after Aaron Echardt's chews threw the movie- acting docile one moment, then out of control in the next-- find out when you see the Black Dahlia.... on video of course, after your friend buys it.
Even when bad reviews started coming in from the Festival it opened in.
I was so excited to see this movie, but when it ended, I was at a whole new level of angry.
The sex scene, between Harnett and Johansson, occurs in the dining room, when, overcome with passion, Bleichert rips away the tablecloth, sending dishes everywhere, and has his way with Lake.
It is pretty sad when two child supporting actors upstage you and put out a better performance Mr. Lawrence.
And then when psycho and bizarre doesn't work, she ends up going to meet his folks on Staten island.
The point is, why see Rebound when their are so many other movies that are so much better in achieving the goals that it Rebound tried to achieve?
Martin when will you learn?
There's also the slapstick assistant coach (played by SNL cast member Horatio Sanz), who bumbles around hoping to provide supplemental humor when basketballs slip out of his grasp and fly in all directions; there's the overzealous opposing coach who thinks junior high school basketball is as important as college or NBA--but then again, can you really blame the guy?
It's a shame when a movie tries so hard to be funny but no one laughs at it.
Just not when its the centerpiece of the movie.
We learn that the child has rapid growth disorder, and we skip ahead to when he's 5 years old and a grown man.
I saw the movie with a number of people who liked it, and when I was discussing it with them, all of their praise was based on the two leads.
Of course, a sense of pride enveloped me when the first few glimpses of the majestic towers were shown.
Although some scenes were manipulated (like the scene when Connery and Zeta-Jones were on a boat on the Malacca river with the Twin Towers on the background.
I don't know but there is something wrong when CZJ tries to act as someone who is very clever but just acts like a stupid insurance agent.
With this movie's pacing and direction, it was impossible to tell what day was what, when things happened etc.
However later that same day when she accidentally runs into someone she believes to be the new handyman, she invites him into her house to make amends to this guy who reminds her so much of her husband somehow.
Also later in the film when a certain character is portrayed as crazy, the whole film turns into a (unintentional) comedy of errs.
To me she always looked like she had something really distasteful in her mouth when she talked and couldn't quite spit it out.
I thought the part that was bizzare was when she (catarina) starts sniffing the air, and said "something stinks, it's you isn't it" (to the psycho killer guy) "you need a bath."
I started laughing when he started stabbing his arm..that was really classic.
Another classic part is when he tells the woman that he has "feelings" for her after 3 hours of knowing her.
Save your self some money and time and just rent it when it come out on dvd!
Also, when they figure out that the terrorists will next target Ron Silver (because of a certain bill that he sponsored), Brosnan goes over to his house - but instead of questioning Silver about who might be against this bill, who might want him dead, he just yells at him to stay away from his wife.
And then later when they figure out that what the bomb is, and how it's detonated, they also figure out a very easy way to defuse it.
Pierce Bronson plays Danny O'Neill, a member of the FBI bomb squad that stumbles on a plot consisting of corrupt Senators and a new form of explosive that is in the form of drinking water - when mixed with acidity of the human stomach, one becomes a walking time bomb that even the strongest Alka-Seltzer wouldn't cure.
But when Danny is assigned to a job of investigating a rash of murdered politicians where no triggering device is evident in the debris, Danny soon fears for his wife's safety, and thus his extra incentive to bring the bad guys to justice.
Rumor quickly spread that it was her head, but rest assured Mansfield's head was attached to her body when she died.
It's now in 1973 when Gatanebo's coffin is being shipped back, from PÃ´rto Prince Haiti, to the Museum of Natural History in New York that he suddenly comes alive.
Sylvia when finally confronted by her long lost lover Gatanebo was anything but trilled in going back with him, to Nigeria, since he was anything but likable or even interesting to her.
In fact when the weather cooled off, or dropped below body temperature, Gatanebo turned into, with his skin dripping off his face and body, what looked like a melting chocolate Easter Bunny!
This was filmed at the height of the blaxploitation/horror era when movies Like "Blackenstein" and "Blacula" were popular, as was a film titled "The Exorcist."
Check out: the papier mache heads, bad African makeup, the fire breathing exotic dancer, and a '70's look that was probably dated when this film was released.
The film opens with the mummy character when he was young and vibrant - we see him with his love, get in a fight over a girl, and then watch his girl beheaded in front of him and then he is "paralyzed" and prepared for mummification.
It makes me upset when they take a writers work and completely change the story to draw an audience.
It was a great book, then when was made into a movie, the story changed.
Here we have another so-called horror flick made only for tasteless teenagers or fans of modern teen flicks like "Urban Legend" or "Scream".No violence,no real thrills,only a lot of predictable cliches.Oh,and there's also incredibly dumb sequence when one girl is scared to death by strange masked figure(Ha!Ha!
"I've Been Waiting For You" (another eye grabbing title) is a feebly light-weight teenage aimed story mixing elements of witchcraft (leading girl interested in the occult / the town living in fear of a curse) / slasher staples (killer with metal claws, black cloak and a hokey looking mask) that when it came to the crunch it's rather diluted, but doesn't hurt.
I didn't know it at the time when I rented the video, but frequent fade-outs to black and someone credited with the teleplay soon made me realize I'd rented a TV movie that was inexplicably (and erroneously!)
The plot becomes a lot more complicated when we realize there is also a lost admiral whom the mad doctor is trying to get information out of by hypnotizing him.
It is also curious why Victor was cast as the chief villain in a Bela Lugosi type role when Lugosi himself was probably available at the time.
His "easily scared" bug-eyed routine is boring, but when the comedy isn't rooted in racism, he gets to deliver some hilarious lines (the dialogue is often very witty--"can I help it if I'm loquacious?")
The treatment of servants and the demeaning stereotypes portrayed here chill us today, but were common and expected in an era where segregation was a way of life, people could actually smoke in hospital rooms, when drunkards were usually funny (especially when driving) and when seat belts were unheard of.
"During World War II, an American agent, his butler and a plot are searching for a missing admiral when their plane crash lands on a Caribbean island.
Things get even more bizarre when a few individuals from the non-living ranks -- the result of the fine doctor's experiments, we learn -- begin roaming around.
While the US was not yet in the war when the film was made, WWII was in full swing and only a group of idiots wouldn't have guessed what was really occurring!
Edward G. Robinson is an actor I almost always admire, even when his material isn't up to par, but in the final scenes here his performance is overwrought and unconvincing.
To be fair, he was miscast in the role of naive, simple-minded construction worker John Allen; Robinson was pushing 40 when this film was made and his childlike pronouncements in the early scenes just don't ring true.
(And the screenplay violates its own gimmick, for there are sequences in Allen's flashback that occur when he isn't present, explaining things he doesn't know, which are therefore "memories" he couldn't have.)
In an early scene when John is working high above Manhattan with his friend Bud on the frame of an unfinished office building, he looks down on the people below and delivers a speech comparing them to ants that suggests a seminal version of Harry Lime's famous speech in The Third Man.
Shirley, like John, is another character who is strangely inconsistent from scene to scene, but she eventually settles into the familiar movie staple of no-good trollop, a parasite who marries John for his steady paycheck and showers him with contempt when his health fails and the paychecks are no longer coming in.
We're given no credible reason whatever why Shirley stays with him, and when she seeks work as a dancer at her former place of employment it seems like a smart survival tactic, but this is where the story's true thesis kicks in: John is now the parasite because he's living off his wife's earnings.
Even so, this is an interesting, unusual movie which stands as a fascinating reflection of the period when it was made.
I had vague memories of seeing this when it came out in 1992.
After i had seen this movie i compared it in my head with the first and how the first one was based off the book i can see that it was extremely better in my eyes but to all you people that like it can you tell me what was going through your head when you saw this movie.
there were moments when I was doubling over in my seat laughing.
This sequel is much worse and was pretty hard to sit through when I watched it for the second time.
I think it is stupid to make splatter films when you have to keep the R in mind..And horror film to be scary, effective and atmospheric, the use of effects is definitely not a must.
things start to happen when a boy loses his dog "Zowie" to a gunshot would by his abusive step dad who is also a sheriff.
The characters who die and come back to life have more personality as a reincarnated corpse than they did when they were alive.
I didn't feel an ounce of sympathy for that pudgy idiot when Gus killed him and his mother.
I was excited when I heard the movie had been banned in 43 countries; this prompted me to rent the film.
So it didn't lie when it said using sideshow performers, but it wasn't what you would have expected.
The boil covered owner of the circus feels more at home with the freaks of the show than he does with normal people.He considers them his family.His family protects him as one of their own when they feel he is in trouble.Therein lies the main plot I guess you'd say.
i really loved when the boyfriend comes back to her and says his pillow doesn't smell like the perfume she sprayed on it anymore.
obviously he HATED when she did it originally, but because she was genuine he wound up missing her.
This is simply not a movie I am extremely broad minded when it comes to films and I adore low budget movies because it enhances the meaning of art behind the process of film making.
This movie is perverse, it provokes a feeling of sick to your stomach and not in a good way- I'm not even conservative when it comes to these things.
In the original the Lan character was a midget called Hans & he is presented as a naive lovestruck child, someone to sympathise with & feel sorry for, here in Freakshow Lan is depicted as nothing more than a dirty old man who wants a nice young blonde girl to give him a blow job when he wants, motivation which just doesn't entice the same sort of feelings towards him.
There's very, very little gore here, the filmmakers hired some of those masochist type guy's who hang themselves on hooks which piece their skin & can be found just about everywhere to do several hooks piecing the skin on their backs type scenes, there's a bit when someone cuts a girls scalp off, someone head is bashed in (off screen), someone is hit with a wrench (off screen), someone is stabbed with a knife, someone has part of their throat bitten out & the end sequence which doesn't last that long & is again full of annoying slow fade to black shots when Lucy has her lips sewn shut, the skin on her body sliced off as well as the skin on her face in a scene which is much less effective than a similar one in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986).
The ending is the worst I have ever had to be put through in one sitting, when the girl has to be remade to fit into the "Family" for betraying them.
This is the classic tale for a kid, when you try to teach him the importance of being yourself, not what you wish to be, and the "meaningless" of trying to change.
Some major continuity moments happen when the film jumps from day to night suddenly & some of the scenes ending & the next one beginning make no sense either.
The audio was so poor that I had to turn the volume up just to hear it and when there was gunfire it almost blew my audio system apart!
There are a few points in the movie when we see penises for no reason.
Almost every joke was completely predictable Â you could see the punchline coming from a mile away, and when it arrived, it wasn't very funny.
But instead it goes a complete different route when there's a knock the door.
That's when the writers seem to have run out of ways to make you groan within the framework of the film and decided to throw in a drug dealing ending that comes completely out of left field.
It's not just that, terrifying but true, he looks like a young Tom Hanks but his acting is clumsy, his voice weak and he occasionally looks unsure of how to act to camera: hard to believe that you're watching the first steps of a future screen great here Â indeed, just about the only line to ring true is when Stanwyck tells him "I'll see you in 1966.
It just wasn't the same for me when Radar left.
It would go even further when a soap opera had a character operating a crisis hotline become overwrought when a person committed suicide over the phone.
Funniest by far was Fame, one of the worst shows around, when Nia Peeples character left the show, she was killed off in an episode involving drunk driving.
I saw it when it came out in 1967, but not since.
He realises that the sexual arousal they experience when watching a Frank Sinatra caricature rooster perform results in them laying eggs in enormous quantities.
I was so excited when I read a movie was being made of this great book.
I swear I could feel my brain cells literally melting away as I watched this cheese fest that is when it wasn't being utterly overwhelmed by the almost vomiting inducing level of political correctness constantly a presence in this film.
Indeed, the gang is made up of members from nearly every different race (must not discriminate after all when it comes to male sleaze balls) and all the guys in the film who seem to be actually able to fight seem to also be totally ineffectual as males for the most part, wearing pink t-shirts or sweatshirts, doing aerobics and basically anything our leading lady Sandy asks them to do.
Some funny lines are when Sam mentions to Sandy he has to go to his brothers wedding in San Francisco and that it will take him a week to get there, keep in mind he is in San Diego.
The acting of the men sucks, but at least they seem to know what they're doing when it comes to martial arts.
I always cringe when someone claims a particular substandard movie is the worst ever, but I am genuinely tempted to make such a claim for "The Great Northfield, Minnesota Raid".
A man suffering from amnesia coming back from war to be confronted with a wife and child...Well we've seen this before and long ago...To be precise in 1938 ,when Curtis Bernardt -who continued his career in America afterward- directed his "carrefour" starring the excellent Charles Vanel and Jules Berry.Here the director -very academic- substituted the Middle Ages for WW1 and presto!an original screenplay!
Look, that's what makes the world go round - but when smart, clever romantic comedies like MR. JEALOUSY OR NEXT STOP WONDERLAND have trouble finding an audience and this coloring book rakes in the money, well, hell, you get what you deserve.
I know disaster movies are part-drama, part-adventure movies, but even when the drama takes backstage to the action, the film disappoints with some really cheesy effects and not-too-exciting action scenes (the overlong bridge-scene comes to mind).
How did I miss this when it first came out?
I guess it speaks volumes when a silly but unintentionally funny disaster movie was a flop and a silly but intentionally funny disaster spoof was a hit.
Not even good enough for one of those days when you are exhausted from work and just want to watch *something*.
Problems first arose on the set of this movie when William Holden discovered Paul Newman was to get top billing for the project.
Only when the film studio guaranteed that Holden would share top billing with Newman did he agree to come back and finish his scenes.
I was too young to see this movie when it was released theatrically, but I can just picture the audience throwing popcorn at the screen before walking out in both confusion and disgust.
There's the tidal wave that trashes the village up the coast when the hotel doesn't see so much as a ripple.
It was destroyed when the volcano blew its top again, shooting out a few tons of fiery rock which arced high in the air and, much against the odds, scored a bullseye.
-And when the guy predictably falls, we first see him fall backwards away from the 'copter, but them the immediate cut-away shot shows him clearly falling in a FORWARD roll.
when they finally put out the flames, only a small part of the top of his jacket is scorched.
The hotel guests are in a panic when Henderson and Kirby arrive back there, as the volcano is spewing lava bombs at them.
In addition, we have a noble thief, who helps the cop out when he becomes disabled.
And there just happens to be an aerialist around when you need one.
I never believed for a second that this shallow college boy would care a cockroach's butt for this pathetic derelict, but 'Harvard' gets what he deserves when the stinky bum assaults him with a lead pipe, throws part of the kid's thesis into a furnace, helps himself to other people's closets for clothes, puts his dirty socks in the oven, disrupts a class in session, murders another student's pet, and asks to be driven across the state-line to visit his son who wants nothing to do with him, causing the student to miss the deadline for turning in his thesis.
The first sign that Lover's Prayer was going to be a loser was when I realized that the people who were supposed to be Russian were speaking with British accents.
Only Lady Diana approaches the level of a person being elevated to veneration when in real life they were next to worthless.
Jackie Kennedy is shown as this wonderful paragon of virtue when most comment now on her actual vapidness.
I was really looking forward to this program when GSN was teasing it all over the place, (I loved the original) but the whole show is just bad.
when is she ever funny or witty?)
These 'stars' seem to lack some common sense when it comes to the questioning.
It also accuses policemen of starting a fight with gang members when both groups were attending functions at the same location.
Yet, the film really shines when it is left to people other than the Abberton brothers to describe the various incidents through their own retelling.
***mild spoiler below***  Once I thought the story was going to take off, when another illegitimate son of A**hole Father moved in with the family, finally someone who had the potential to give a swerve to the plot line.
I have no problem with movies this violent but when you don't suppose to feel anything for the victims it is a waste of time, and for 144 Min.
And by the way, when I first saw this a few years ago, I thought that henchman "Bob" was head and shoulders better than anyone else in the film.
I had an attack of the giggles part way through the movie, and it worsened with the ludicrous plot developments, culminating in a full-fledged laughing attack when the Tibetan monk at the end spoke so badly they had to subtitle him... even though he was attempting to speak English.
The funniest part is when it premiered in Malaysia, Michelle Yeoh was so adamant about destroying every pirated copy of this movie.
Michelle Yeoh recognizes successful financial formulas when she sees one and is at the crux of this flimsy little caper film, cashing in on the popularity of the genre.
A great director like yourself should know a good script when he sees one or at least have the talent to turn a mediocre plot in a worthwhile movie?
For example when the leader of the kids, you know the 12-year-old James Dean wannabe, hypnotizes two truck drivers into parking their vehicles on the beach!
Or when he takes away the scientists' ability to speech!
Or when all children stand in front of the glowing stone and the camera zooms in on all their faces separately!
For example, when the alien lands it causes power cuts that extend as far as the rocket launch site, so it not clear why the alien needs to enlist the aid of the children in the first place (anyway, why not work through adults?).
START>ALL PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIES>ACCESSABILTY>NARRATOR  Have you ever woke up on Christmas day when you was young and seen a present that was so nicely wrapped, with the best looking paper that you just couldn't wait to open it, then when you do you find that all you got was socks?
It was actually when I watch The Warriors on DVD with some mates that I decided to exchange an old game for this which was about Â£15 at the time, and in true cult style surrounded in controversy.
Everything about this game looked so cool, from when it told me to set the screen to get the "BEST EXPERIENCE" and that it was set in a city at night.
To me it feels like Rockstar realized that the game play was sluggish and rather than scrap the whole thing decided to do was singers do when they have a terrible song, make it so it gets band (Well Almost).
I could just see them in the offices now...  "Sir its about the game Manhunt" "Whats wrong with it" "Well, theenemies AI..." "Is that all" "No there's also the sluggish combat, poor graphics, repetitive game play, its boring and when you get into a fight you just end up taking turns hitting one another till someone drops, should we scrap it?"
This gets very boring when you realize there its a trick to killing everyone which is, hide in the shade, tap the wall and make the enemy come to you and then wait for him to turn away so you can make your move.
Like when a member of Cash's (the guy you play as) family gets shot in the head, you hear  "Ow no, thats just to bad"  OK when read it might seem lame, but its not so much what he says its how he says it.
In conclusion I can't think why any cult fan would what to buy this when the awesome Warriors video game is out there, maybe for about Â£5 its worth it to hear the genius of Mr. Cox, the saving grace in this pair of socks.
An exciting part is when Thomas Gomez is thrown off a cliff.
This film is living proof that pictures with star quality will fail when the writing is bad.
What flows on the page is stilted when forced into the mouths of actual people.
This is so disappointing, considering the days when Brooks wowed us with "BLAZING SADDLES" and the horror genre send up of "YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN."
The man is really funny, at least when he's interviewed.
One imagines that Brooks' comic radar is so finely-attuned that he would have seen through the financial and corporate layers of this film's drudgery and simply either abandoned it and cut his losses when he saw that it was not working, or salvaged the potential high points and let the cutting room floor eat the rest.
Remember when Mel Brooks used to be funny?
Another big problem with Dracula: Dead and Loving It is that it's just not very funny, in fact as to prove my point the best scene is when Harker & Van Helsing stake Lucy through the heart & are covered in gallons of blood, horror first guys, horror first...
Apparently the dialogue in Dracula: Dead and Loving It spoofs a lot of the dialogue from the original Dracula (1931) with Bela Lugosi, well that's fine if you've seen the original Dracula which I haven't & I'm sure many other people haven't either so I have to ask myself what was the point when there was always going to a large amount of viewers who haven't seen the original Dracula, it seems like a bit of a waste & an in-joke a lot of people weren't going to get.
Technically Dracula: Dead and Loving It is pretty darn good but this aspect of things only leads to more frustration when one thinks what this film could have been, as someone who has sat through loads of low budget horror I could only think what the likes of Hammer could have done with a budget like this.
A movie that promises a lot, but doesn't deliverÂ especially when you  realise it is a total take on "The Shining" !
The actors are excellent  and, at first, the mystery is well drawn, but when the main actor (A  writer falling under the spell of spirits - rings a bell ?)
I was feeling generous when I wrote this review  I would say don't watch this movie for any reason, but it might be fun to watch it with a group of friends with the sole purpose of laughing at it.
Second, when Gooding gets out of his car in the end after quitting the asylum, he climbs out of the car and with more sappy music swelling does the Tim Robbins Shawshank-escape Jesus pose in the driving rain... unbelievable syrupy tripe.
Special in the way that dentists have when they do root canal work without anaesthetic.
I remember in 1997 when it came out I didn't watch it now ten years later I disgusted with the movie.
I saw RED HEAT on TV when I was about 11.
I think it's because when you look up the title of the movie, it comes up with 3 different ones... the title was too common and overused!
The plot, or so it is, has to do with a bunch of teenagers on a road trip to who cares when their car gets attacked by a swarm of very phony looking locusts or something (if you watch close enough there is a cut where the characters are swatting and squirming and screaming but there aren't actually locusts in that cut.
So the spoiler lies in my saying this: There's a scene when Santigo and that creepy lady with the Avon lady fake grin all the time do their Hoo-Doo, Voo-Doo or whatever they call it on Charlene and get her to slit her own throat.
Just when it feels as though we are going to learn something, the plot becomes more confusing.
My grandfather was a detective on this case, as my family lives in Staten Island, where the Cimarelli's lived, and he was physically in the room when this happened.
The situation of Daniel is incoherent, since his niece is left in a school for troubled youths, and only when she vanishes, he seeks information about the place where she was living.
The movie has that unsatisfying, cheap digital look that, when combined with the horrible acting and the lousy plot, make the film look like a failed attempt for a high-school project.
I normally think it's funny when someone tries to create the surfer lifestyle and completely screws it up.
There are a couple of scenes when we hear some ambient, "street" music - the predictable Parisian accordion, and the completely unexpected Breton bagpipes droning in an over-packed Eiffel Tower elevator - preposterous and rude, but not funny!
She seems rather wistful or even sad when attempting to discuss the Prince with Menjou or offering "motherly" advice to DeHavilland.
She tells Forsythe that she was in the presence of Menjou when he struck "a woman" (HA-HA!
Finally the overthrow the King when the former-teacher fixes him some 'super-fiber' muffins.
My favourite moment is when Lee Van Cleef confuses a would-be assassin by posing behind a gilt picture frame.
Rent first  I saw this years ago in the theater when it came out upon release and my first impression still stands.
when i heard of this show i was yelling "i need to see this!
("Druidian Idol, "SpiderMawg") And as i'm sure most of you are already aware, when you DVR something, you have the luxury of fast forwarding the commercials, credits, etc.
It seemed like an hour had passed when in reality it had only been about ten minutes.
Why resort to gym shoes, when dancing barefoot has been the norm for hundreds of years.
Only satisfying moment was when her selfish fiancÃ©e exited her life.
It also showed what families go threw when fighting for a child where a husband has killed his wife and tries to get custody after he has done a horrible crime.
That's when Alex discovers his wallet is missing and realizes Felix is undoubtedly the guilty party.
Phillip also pushes Missy and Alex together and then acts as if he is jealous when they act on it.
The background for this movie is Washington, D.C. and the White House, but there is no real "presidential" feel to the film and the Secret Service is made out to be little better than the Keystone Kops when it come to doing their duty.
this movie isn't that great...at all but it's good when you want to just laugh, because it's pretty ridiculous :) there are a lot of mistakes in it and it's cheesy.
this movie is good for someone young...although come to think of it, i didn't even like it much when i was like 12 but that's just my personal opinion.
Of course he was tried and committed by white folk so therefore when he escapes he goes after them, and takes them out to the desert for...either tribal justice or revenge, you can decide.
Especially when they could have made it in front of a bluescreen with cgi backgrounds.
The X-files had better effects when they aired their first episodes in 1993.
The film was great in 1994 when it came out.
It reminds me when you see a commercial with a famous athlete in it, trying to be funny, but he is not.
Come get me when it's framed and hanging on the wall--then, I'll appreciate it.
The only redeeming parts of this film were when Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly were on stage.
This movie had a great impact on my life, when you think about it, anyone of us can be a victim of someone as mentally disturbed as Kenneth Taylor.
The Ugly: I will never get that 85 minutes of my life back, so when I am in my death bed I will regret all the things I could have done other than watch Megacrap, but at least it will make me think of the beautiful Beverly Lynne and at least that will bring a smile.
The visualisation of psychological dread inevitably compromises the impact experienced when reading the stories, where we are allowed the slow build-up of anticipation and fear.
While there are still some funny gags typical of Tex Avery (such as when Bugs' various body parts quickly disconnect when he gets scared), the Fetchit character's presence makes the whole thing uncomfortable, especially during the final sequence when he's challenged to a crap game.
Their morbid business finally raises suspicion when an American investigator arrives in London in search of a former partner.
I was a NJ resident when this case broke in 1984.
In reading this book again, I realized that the "child" is now a young man of 25 - the same age his mother was when she was murdered.
The jump cut editing when Damon Dash was on the phone was trite and frivolous.
This in no way touches on the depth of character from Louisa May Alcott's book, in fact it's so bad that when certain important events occur...don't want to give anything away here concerning the plot...one is left wondering why they should care.
Perhaps that colors my perspective, but watching some of these episodes in 2008-09 hasn't done anything to change my opinion of the show back in 1978-79 when I first saw it.
The family is making their way home after a trip when their minivan falls under the glare of a bright light..
The only enjoyment I got out of this movie was watching Dean Stockwell....I loved it when he was frying up eggs for breakfast, and then asked the dad if he would rather have granola..or (with great disdain) Yogurt!
He cheats on her, has several affairs, and when she returns from Acapulco after the honeymoon, she has already been physically abused.
The scenes with the police, and when they investigate the home where the murder has been committed, using Luminol, are disturbing and effective.
The song exhorts us to "Try to remember the kind of September when life was slow and oh so mellow".
Fact and fiction got confused in my mind when Mia Farrow's character started talking about shooting her mother's gangster lover when she was a teenager.
Usually when Woody borrows an idea from Bergman he makes that idea his own, and turns it into something that's clever yet funny and entertaining.
Canicule is a French attempt to make an American style gangster film and they're not bad at it when doing things like Lemmy Caution with American expatriate Eddie Constantine.
Pursuit to Algiers starts as the world's foremost detective Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone) & his faithful assistant Dr. Watson (Nigel Bruce) are about to head up to Scotland for a holiday when the Prime Minister (Frederick Warlock) of an obscure Europeon country named Rovenia ask's for their help.
It's the kind of film you make with your friends when you're bored.
Then the "drump-drump-drump" sound when the mad man was coming after a victim just got on your nerves.
Especially when you notice no sequel was made.
Even the killer, who was sorta formidable looking from a distance during the first part of the movie, becomes ludicrous when we finally see him up close.
Yes sir-ee-bob, they really pulled the wool over my eyes when they added 'lake' to the end of camp crystal.
I didn't want this review to turn into a scathing attack...but there are several things that producers need to be aware of when making a horror movie on a summer camp;   1.The name has to be original.
The only surprise in the film is when the "hero" suddenly gets hung out to dry in the first half of the film.
*** Point of interest: This film is further proof that, when in danger, climbing inside a fridge is your best bet for survival.
At the end when she is getting dragged by the hairs, she shows no sign of pain and yells very boringly ''ahhhh'' A grown @** woman is more scared of the caveman looking farmer than the little kids, they didn't even seemed worried or scared at all.
Finally, they said he didn't feel a thing when they bit his nose off, how come he was wining when he got stabbed or his hand was getting hit with a pole?
Still, it was amusing when one of the counselors stumbles upon a headless corpse only to query, "Are you alright?".
Watch the opening sequence and marvel out how shoddy the editing is: when one of the baddies fires at an officer, there is actually what looks like a break in the film (as if to chop a few frames out) followed by a painfully out-of-sync death scene of the fat officer- ooph!- getting plugged by a bullet, which apparently stopped in mid-air for five seconds while the camera crew switched reels.
My favorite bad moment is when the kidnapped girl is ravaged by one of the enemy soldiers.
Extremely slight actioner featuring clean-cut, country club kids turning into suburban Rambos when one of their friends (a busty blonde, no less!)
Pfieffer was 29 when she made this film and at her most lovely.
Romance develops eventually leading to tragedy when his wife finds out.
They all want something from the studio boss but in the end when he is asked to resign, they all realize their careers will now be going nowhere.
At the speed as shown in the movie you burn the rope, burn your fingers when you touch the metal parts of your gear.
So this big build-up around the DANCE, and when she finally gets up and does it... it's like this White Girl Cabbage Patch thing that, quite literally, gave me a stabbing pain in my stomach.
The funniest part of the movie was the final scene when the caving "experts" turn out to be explosives "experts" as well.
For example, this movie is supposed to be set in India, yet all of the Indian characters speak English...when talking to each other!
I'm pretty certain that soldiers in the Indian army don't speak English when talking amongst themselves far from any Americans.
In addition, the cave sets look fake and the centipedes themselves, when they are finally revealed, look like...well...puppets of some kind.
And what about the whole France thing, maybe Nicolaiescu tried some fine irony, when the french editor suggested the journalist that she may write something about: orphans, dogs, AIDS, crap like that..., so Mr. Nicolaiescu WTF.., is in your movie..., isn't exactly the same...
and finally What is the point of the scene where people get shot on a bridge..., if the guy is dreaming..., why that is the only scene that merely brushes with the reality I know about the revolution, when everything else feels artificial and farfethced  !!!FLAMING:!!!
Nicolaescu is obviously a delusional character (interesting - or better said, funny - to note that when the film was released he appeared completely drunk on the news, giving an unimaginably incoherent interview); I did expect something very cheesy but this just blew me away.
First time when my son brought home the CD with "15", we just had a look.
Elwood waited until the next morning, when the warden finally came out and told him the awful news: Jake had passed away.
That's also when Elwood meets a young, sarcastic orphan named Buster.
But when the end was approaching there were too many errors in the story to enjoy it any more.
First thing, above all others, is that when anybody attempts to make a popcorn flick outside of the States, the product will fail, for sure.
Second, the idea is good, but the rendering of it came out pretty lame with the thankful exceptions of a few shots, especially when Leo (the younger Jaquou) is present.
French films, when they're true to their origin, are usually reflective, deep, difficult, full of drama and demanding for most audiences.
It's just hard to believe the shows message when the characters are unrealistic (they have 5 year old kids on the show that talk like they are at a theological seminary.
And to all those people who defend this show by saying that it teaches kids a thing or two when compared to other shows... F*** that.
Since when did mediocrity, denial, misogyny, propaganda and bigotry become good examples for your children?
I have to admit that when I was younger, I used to love watching this show, I actually thought it was very realistic and that it had a good plot each episode.
Now of course, I was only 11 when I was watching the first season and I guess since it had grown up's in it, I assumed it was true to life.
Now we have major problems with this show that I realized, first off Aaron Spelling casts unbelievably good looking teens(who look nothing alike, when they're supposed to be siblings), not to mention their unrealistic reactions to their problems.
It's just a silly show when you really look at it, all I have to say to this family if I met them is to start minding their own business and take care of their own problems.
In another scence, a lone police officer is busy searching for missing girls, yet strange enough, when he is killed, it seems he is not missed at all.
The kid doesn't know who his mother is and when she sees him in a local malt shop, he's a boorish jerk.
Where was Gale Storm and Mantan Mooreland when Monogram really needed them?
It is all so awful and crummy...and actually annoying when one more tweak up by all concerned would result in ZIS being actually FUN.
I missed this movie when it appeared, and I saw it just lately, because I read some very enthusiastic reviews on it and, living in Germany, I think one has to cope also to the local cinematographic up-to-date situation.
So when I checked it out, I hoped to find a stunning movie about a man and his immortal love.
Sadly, when it came to viewing the whole thing, the horror aspect was played more prominently than the comedy.
He drops off her lost little journal thing at her house and runs away when she answers the door.
The movie expects people to laugh when heads are sliced off and when girls are cut into pieces with a fan.
when that is true then the movie can't be great =D=D=D (not to dis myself, but to be honest) stay away from this crap.
It's amazing that any video store would pick up a steaming pile like this, when so many other worthwhile films never get picked up.
Nice when it stops.
Casting was OK, but OMG, what happened to Roselyn when she got old!
In one hysterically funny scene, Kathy is a prisoner in her own home when her husband and "the guys" are playing cards on one side of the house, and their wives, "the girls" are gossiping on the other side of the house, going on and on and on and on about "cheese and olives."
Barbara desperately tries to rhythmically alter her lines to imbue them with deeper meaning, but when she's stuck with stupid, gushy conversation like, "Oh Bill darling!"
An absolute must for dateless Fridays when you don't care about being fat and lonely.
It's not 10 minutes of screen time between when she seemingly rejects anything but a career and is next going on and on about wanting to do nothing but darn Hayden's socks.
How could it, when the results of the investigation would send her to the gas chamber?
Film noir plots at their best are logical outcroppings of humanity and twists of fate (Neff selling insurance to a greedy monster; Robinson spending a pleasant evening with Joan Bennett when they are forced to kill her jealous, insane lover in THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW).
But when that fails to change things, she kills Burr - and suddenly Hayden is temporarily promoted.
The best character in it is Burr, who when seeing the results of his tawdry affair comes to his senses and resolves to end it and return to Wray, the woman he always loved.
(It won't be before time when they do.)
The doctor comes across as not a bad man, but a bit clueless and insensitive - when he learns that a patient speaks what appears to be some Slavic tongue, he asks Lucia to try talking to him in Italian, but slowly.
I was in college when JANE visited Vietnam; I thought her actions were disloyal to the United States, and to the men & women fighting in SE Asia against communism.
Sellers is also good at the end when he has burned out or is on a bad trip and is weary of all the freeloaders who have moved into his apartment (and started to share his flower-child free-spirited bedmate).
In fact, who cares that in this film there is no zero gravity in space, rockets decelerate when the engines are cut in space (space is a vacuum or near-vacuumÂdeceleration does not occur in this state), people are thrown about the ship as it steers and other "facts" that are contradicted by the laws of physics!
And, when they finally are able to penetrate the planet's defenses, a surprising thing is learned about the Venusians themselves.
The film looks extremely primitive today, but when it debuted its special effects and costumes were actually quite advanced.
Based on a Polish science fiction novel, this movie is set in 1985, when the world is at global peace.
I remember the time when every Socialist coffee house had furniture like the "glass forest of Venus".
Oh, and let's not forget the despicable, but unavoidable precious little robot, one of which you can unmistakably find in every 50s sci-fi flick, so you can marvel how it's cute little light bulbs start flashing frantically when it starts talking in a funny little voice!
Filmed in 1960, the story takes place in the way distant future of 1985, when an extraterrestrial "spool" is discovered in the Gobi Desert area of Siberia.
I chuckled a couple times, but they were the kind of chuckles that slip out when you are desperately seeking to be entertained.
Like when The cute virgin is pulled apart by whatever, the two friends find her and says "now that's just stretching it."
Last year I was at a video store with a few friends when we saw the case for Scream Bloody Murder.
We were somewhat disappointed when we got to the actual viewing part as the movie was plain bad.
I don't want to spoil anything but you'll know when it happens.
It's a truism when they say this movie is nothing more than Dances with Wolves in space.
Her suspicion is raised when the girls at the school tell her the story of three witches who took over the school 100 years ago.
I think there is a serious side to this movie though and it is summed up neatly in Elwood's inspirational speech when he reminds his rebellious band members what society will be left with if real musicians give up making music.
I have never been so close to leave the movie theater, as i was when seeing Avatar.
At the time when I'm writing this review, Avatar sits on the 24th position of the TOP250, between 25th Silence of the Lambs and 23th Once Upon a Time in the West.
Actors and setting - Who the hell need actors when we've got CGI?
Let's say the movie entertainment industry has a problem, that people don't go to theaters anymore, because they can watch movies from home, especially when they can get it on piratebay, right?
There is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning, but even that is done without any care for how it is shot.
I especially enjoyed when the "herder" farts on the husband.
You know you got something pretty sick when one of the first scenes include a guy having sex with a goat and then killing it off.
The ending is OK allright when the couple turn out to be brother and sister and she is just letting him rot somewhere but overall one would have expected more.
I have nothing against silly films, but only when there is something else to make up for it.
when i found out he was in this movie, i was expecting a cheesy cameo, but i was happy to get much much more than that.
But when I watch a Movie I  want to be entertained by the story and the plot as well as the  scenery.
And make sure to pay attention, otherwise you'll miss the reason why the prisoners have enough money to be able to afford ascellular dermal grafts when they get bad gums.
How about this, when Robson asks about Dr. Faraj's schedule so he can ask what race of gums he was given, Faraj is so terrified that he goes to the warden and quits his job on the spot.
Lemmon and Allyson are starred; and they are interesting to watch, especially during the scene when she declares her love to him.
There are times when, instead of background music, there are background songs.
I always like days in Spanish class when my teacher is out, because she gives us some movie to watch.
However, when she told us we were going to be watching SELENA the next day, all the girls who'd seen it seemed excited.
I was interested in Selena, the person, when our teacher told us about her.
(When, oh, when, will we see a stagecoach in dangerous country without a greedy banker?)
But when they produce a movie that specifically points at Arabs with the finger and makes every other group of people look fine that's called racism.
It's no longer funny when it's boring...and it gets boring quite easily.
What i don't particularly like about Green is when the joke runs too long, or the joke isn't funny to begin with.
Somehow they gave this movie the subtitle "Hard Boiled 2" even when there is no connection to that superior movie.
But when you use a title like that it does raise some expectation concerning the action.
There is not one scene where he is serious even when a gun is pointed at him.
That is, the when the agent's partner was killed, he and his wife (Rene Russo) suddenly find themselves to be the foster parents of that guy's three little girls.
Sadly, the film ended up shelved due to the company's many problems until 2006, when finally, "The Woods" was released straight to video.
In addition they didn't seem to get suspicious when a known mafia-boss trailed the shipment of gold by two meters.
That with the exception when they get to the big motorway and load the minis into the bus.
Charlie Croker goes through a lot of trouble to get this guy on the team, and his disappearance isn't even noticed when it happens.
I'm really wondering how they reacted when seeing the petty results of their efforts.
In the end I was glad when it was over.
Especially when you consider that the main character is resurrected.
We're introduced to various mysterious characters when Deneuve is off-screen, but they seem lifeless and uninteresting by comparison.
I remember when Michael O'Donoghue was writing for National Lampoon; he had a "how to write a short story" article.
For example, in The Matrix, when we shown that it is Trinity's love for Neo that brings him back from the dead, the audience is able to accept this because the reality that has been established is one of sci-fi machines-rule-the-world type.
Lucky McKee's long-awaited (at least by me) new film is perhaps slightly disappointing when compared to his debut "May" and the exquisite Masters of Horror episode "Sick Girl", but it's still a spooky supernatural chiller and easily one of the most stylish genre-efforts released during the last five years.
I have no idea what the Beatles were thinking when they made this, and I'm sure neither did they.
Boxing Day 1967 was when it all came together for the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band - not only did they enjoy a novelty hit with 'I'm the Urban Spaceman' and television exposure thanks to Eric Idle, Michael Palin and Terry Jones's Pre-Python children's series DO NOT ADJUST YOUR SET, they also had a cameo in a film that was premiered that day on BBC1.
Surrealism only really works when it's juxtaposed with some form of reality, which is why TOUR flops so badly - there's nothing here that even points towards reality.
(I often wonder what is in my own children's minds when they stare off in silence.)
Those sprites of the northern lights are always the burning flesh on my tongue when i drink a hot chocolate.
So bottom line, at least see this once....but i guarantee you'll go mad when you hear about those sprites of the northern lights.
There was an episode when they poked fun of the Facts of Life and had a man playing the role of Mrs. Garrett.
This eye-rolling occurred, by the way, when I wasn't closely examining my much-more-interesting cuticles.
The story begins in earnest when the youngest Donahues hit legal age, or there abouts.
Overall, it's a sad commentary on the lack of originality and quality of the film when the likes of Monroe, Gaynor and especially O'Connor can't even save it, even though individually and collectively they do have their moments; the problem is those moments are just too few and far between.
And it leaves you with a single, burning question that demands to be asked: Where's Gene Kelly when you need him?
That's what's good about the movie, it builds up quite slowly (also because actually there is not much story to build up) and when we are fully aware of the threats, the viewer is also aware of the fact that one cannot escape from a mysterious force that is everywhere around you.
Not even when Bruce Campbell is your dad.
I'd missed the opening credits, and when I looked them up on IMDb I was very pleasantly surprised to see who it was.
But... Why does he need to demonstrate his strength with a global warning when he just almost destroyed the planet?
- sending an ambassador out of the ship when it is surrounded by military is not intelligent at all, especially when he is not invincible.
After being wounded in an attack by the U.S. military, the human-like Klaatu (Keanu Reeves) appears when being nursed back to health and hints at the potential destruction of Earth.
How are we supposed to leach on to anyone when no one is even remotely likable?
The days when Hollywood once turned out such classics as the l951 THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, are long gone.
There's no sense of impending disaster and when the day finally comes for the Earth to stand still, a swarm of badly executed CGI bugs destroy Yankee Stadium and then stop.
And try as I might to figure out what was actually going on, nothing become apparent until about an hour and a half in when Keanu talks about saving the earth from humans.
We expect that from Keanu Reeves, but when Jennifer Connelly, who gives it her all even in junk like Hulk, phones it in, you should realize your project has little merit.
I laughed out loud in several spots when "Klaatu" explained to us the reason for his mission.
It grossed me out when he stuck his finger in the 'planceta' and then in the dead cop's mouth!
Save your money, The Day the Earth Stood Still was when I wasted an hour and 40 minutes of my time watching this crappy film!
I guess since it looks like it hurts when his face expresses human emotion, he's what the director needed.
Dr. Helen Benson, a Princeton professor, and other scientists are hastily assembled by the government in order to formulate a survival plan when it is feared that a large unknown object is due to impact Manhattan in approximately 78 minutes.
So when I really think about this movie, it just makes me sad.
Even when it thinks it's being cool (like the lame reveal that those alien spheres are actually "arks" trying to save animal life before the world is annihilated) the script fails miserably.
And then there's poor little Jaden Smith, who appears bored to tears throughout the film and is given no direction from Derrickson except when he is asked to cry on cue in the supposed emotional climax of the picture that left me feeling sorry for all involved.
And just when he seems poised to open a can of whip-ass, he gets silenced by Keanu/Klaatu who is coiled up in a fetal position on the pretty microbiologist's lap.
The soundtrack alone is worth the price of a rental and when you see it, you can join the legions of fans who's eyes glaze over when they hear those three immortal words: klaatu barada nicto.
You know you have a problem when dialogue is so bad that it even drags Reeves's acting down.
And when the devices used to create the melodrama are so laughably contrived (who knew that a white step mom and a black step son could have such hard times getting along?
Mind you, when the special effects are even more ridiculous than the ensuing melodrama in a big sci-fi pic like this, what is there to keep you sitting still, let along standing?
Well, one of the girls says that when the school was just founded there were three girls who wandered in from the woods, who stayed, supposedly orphans, or perhaps, witches.
It is a wonderful color, softly shining and lasts throughout - except at the climax when it starts to fade!
From the moment I started watching it to the blessed moment when the credits finally rolled, I was stunned at the sheer awfulness of this movie.
She make extremely nasty comments to her roommate, hangs up on her grandfather when he calls her to tell her her father is dying and is the most narcissistic nasty character I have seen on the screen in a long time.
Which means when I got to a museum and see a blotch on the wall I don't pretend it's art and say a bunch of meaningless, pseudo-intellectual prattle.
Using a creepy atmosphere to develop the characters and the supernatural mysteries surrounding the boarding school and their teachers, the story reaches its climax in the very end, when the secret of the Falburn Academy is finally disclosed.
The film gets extremely boring very fast as when you have seen one of these scenes you have pretty much seen them all.
The problem I have (apart from the fact that seeing this has made me realise I must have grown up from since when I used to go to rotten.com and impress my mates with just how sick a video or image I could find and mail them!)
The worst of which being when we see the result of a train crash and the charred bodies are taken out one by one.
The film gets extremely boring very fast as when you have seen one of these scenes you have pretty much seen them all.
And occasionally the filmmakers' cursory stabs at even the most predictably stereotypical storytelling degenerate into freak-show gawking, as when the camera, now close up, leers pornographically at the jumbled tattoos of a wretched trailer-denizen or lingers, almost mockingly, upon the painfully unfortunate physiognomy of one of the twice-born.
Even casual students of southern culture should look askance at a film that runs roughshod over a large, often troubled but intricately complex and diverse region--a film that, when it condescends to look at southern people at all, only stares at them as specimens, whose life-habits, histories and individual destinies are as straightforward and predictable as those of a toad in a terrarium.
But when ignorance, poverty and needless suffering are the lived reality rather than a marketing tool I have a hard time caring whether there's "beauty in it."
She actually looked Greek when she was younger!
"Leprechaun" dances on the screen, a courageously terrible little horror jig that could have only come out in 1993, when movies this bad actually got halfway decent actors.
The cast all seems to be having fun, probably between acting gigs when they had nothing better to do.
There was a time, I am ashamed to say when I was into low budget cult horror movies.
But when it is rated 15/R for good reason (it is bloody in parts), which 15 year old is going to go for this when they could go for all those better films out there?
Tory goes to O'Grady at the hospital to find out how they can kill the Leprechaun, and when she does find him he says they need a four-leafed clover.
So after some chases and trappings, they get time to search for this clover in a big patch, and luckily find it, just when Leprechaun has got his gold and realised one coin is missing.
What do you get when you mix HORRIBLE writing, bad acting, shortsighted direction and some of the stupidest moments in the history of Cinema?
Something I can always count on when watching these older slasher (I guess that's what you would call this???)
At the end, when the leprechaun climbs up out of the well with his face peeling off and screams, for the last time, "I want me go...aah....ohh," I was laughing.
And it was kind of funny when he summons his bag of coins from Jennifer Aniston's hand, and you can see the string guiding it over to him.
A demonic little Irishman(Warwick Davis) wreaks havoc in a small town in North Dakota when his golden coins are disturbed.
I was just passing out of the target demographic when I saw this, so perhaps I'm more blasÃ© about it than I might have been if I had seen it a few years earlier.
please remember that when you start bashing him.
He can act when the script and director allowed him.
I think that since he missed his youth, he's trying to catch up with that now, and if you see it from that point, have you never had a slumberparty with a friend when you were young?
Like when crying about a Christmas tree and then the cop wannabe STEALS one!
See, that's exactly what happens when you're being mild and give favorable reviews to insignificant 80's horror movies like the original "The Unnamable".
Check out the sound it makes when the deputies are shooting the lock at the end.
I can remember a time long ago when MTV actually played videos.
Roger Moore, a Tory tax exile who should never have been cast as James Bond since he was already too old when he started, had no problems with funding apartheid throughout the 1970s.
when they could as easily shoot them, too.
So that when an aeroplane arrives to strafe and bomb them, it's spoilt for choice (actually, that's the cunning plan; confuse the pilot).
Pluses include a key plot twist in the middle of the film and a sequence when Moore drops his smarm long enough to make a mobster eat a bag of heroin at gunpoint.
But you know you are in trouble in the first minute of the film, when rocker Joan Armatrading tries to channel Joan Baez with an utterly tuneless ballad while a 007-ish title sequence flashes up images of suffering Africans.
The expressions on the children's faces when they first see Slappy was priceless -- and the final scene was nothing but laughs.
But lengthy soft or hard porn sequences that have been arbitrarily introduced when not required quickly make for an extremely boring thriller.
Wanted my money back, tried to get it back and was given it back when I said the quality of the tape was so poor it looked like a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy recorded off a machine with dirty heads that were fifteen years old.
Oh, it's also a lot of fun when you can see the dead bodies breathing (I haven't seen that blunder in film in quite some time).
I guess it has some decent violence and gunplay in it, but even it is rediculous and unrealistic, with very poor effects (big flashes of light when someone gets shot from point blank range).
I wrote better stuff when I was a freshman in high school.
Gone are the days when countries sang in their own language - ABBA made sure of that with their pretty songs - and nearly all participating countries sing in English.
As a movie, it's a mess: the title relates to a location of stolen money, but the money isn't stolen until well past the half way point in the running time, and so nobody's in hell, public or private, for almost an hour but are instead laboriously working their way to that point in the script when the movie can actually begin.
Normally when I watch older films, I am able to suspend disbelief and just enjoy, but this time it was a major chore not to just turn the movie off about midway through it!
First of all, due to 1936 technology, it is sometimes hard to hear the actors when they are not near the microphone, or when they are facing away from the position of the microphone.
I wonder if the producers would have the same attitude when the situation is reversed.
If a corporation floats junk bonds and then declares bankruptcy, are we to feel sorry for those stock holders that lose everything when the bond holders insist on repayment?
Nobody holds a gun to our head when we sign up, or make purchases.
You see, when you lower the interest rate it doesn't just effect spending but it also effects saving.
Maybe we'll install credit cards with some sort of child-proof lock, which will somehow becomes active when you're about to make an imprudent purchase.
Hey, I got a credit card when I started college and I was smart enough to realize that you still have to pay for all that stuff.
I never bought more than I could afford to pay off when the bill came.
I'm not saying all that is entirely untrue, but the fact is the primary design of the bill was to stop the trend of people using bankruptcy as the easy way out even when there were other ways to escape their problems.
Anyone who has had dogs knows that you don't disturb them when they are eating dinner.
Make any kind of film you want -- just don't label it as funny when it isn't.
One of the principle evidences of this transformation was when, discovering that the German Shepherd had killed the disabled dog, Peggy rushes to the pound to try to save the German Shepherd.
they just never stopped laughing or smiling even when it was the most "dramatic" moment!
or because he used to drool over her topless pics when he was younger, on the internet??)
I used to like Shannon when she was younger, but she seems to become a worse actress as she has gotten older (something I thought was impossible for anyone).
This woman is now totally unbelievable as an actress and casting her as some girl next door character just doesn't work anymore (especially when you see how difficult it was for the makeup people to hide the bags under her eyes).
No, she only decides when she finds out that the "dream guy" is actually not very nice.
At the first sign of any problems she will look somewhere else then, when it all go wrong, she'll go back and the idiot Ben will take her back.
But yet, when he gets in front of a camera for a movie, everything seems to go wrong.
I managed to watch it all the way through, but I was glad when it finished.
i can't get the image of Joey out of my mind when I see Matt LeBlanc, so seeing him as the tough guy was a bit odd.
Later the same Brit is about to be captured when LeBlanc knifes the German - pretty tough stuff for a comedy!
Of course, "Bullitt" is a legendary movie and it was a tremendous hit when released.
I can be fascinated by an unlikable character that I can't personally relate to when it's well written into a gripping character-study (as, say, Isabelle Huppert's complex Erica Kohut in "The Piano Teacher"), but that won't happen if they are also completely uninteresting and lack any sort of substance.
I went in being optimistic of catching a horror movie but I burst out laughing when i saw the first supposedly 'scary' scene where the God of Death appears.
And what about when the business men were Kira?
The zombies were more funny that scary, and it almost made me chuckle a few times because they act sort of funny, running around mumbling, the gore was good, I like when the guy got his throat bitten out, and when the one police officers fingers got bitten off reminded me of a scene from the remake of Wes Craven's "The Hills Have Eyes" which was my favorite part in that movie, so it was kind of cool to see a similar scene in this movie.
i first heard of the film years ago, lots of hype about it being a great little indie zombie film (i am a huge huge fan of the genre), then when i eventually got hold of a copy it was well packaged and the cover looked good......after the opening sentence i had already made up my mind that this film was complete and utter tripe but i still gave the movie a chance.
I mean some of these performances are just god awful bad and it's apparent why when you look through the DVD extras.
Bookwalter is still at it today, nearly twenty years later, and is just as talent deprived (ie- Ozone) as he was when this piece of trash first came out.
I used to work with a lady who had a small part in the movie when she was a preteen.... in the birthday party scene she is wearing the yellow dress.
I was inappropriately approached by grown men when I was a teen, but I knew NOT to do what they wanted me to do.
It was made for TV on a Sunday afternoon when everyone was out and they needed some crap to fill the gaps between paid programming, and it should have stayed that way.
I understand the intentions of the producers, they wanted to show to the viewers, that there was a few kids that have been charged with murder and put to death penalty... but that is only theoretical truth, deathpenaltyinfo.org on this page you can see all the people punished with death sentence, for the crime they've committed, when they were under aged... as you can see all the defendants were 17, not 14, when they committed the crime... And by the time they were killed, years have past.
4ex, Joseph Cannon had waited 21 years for the crime he committed, when he was 17, and i'm sure he made a lot more terrible things by the time he was 38.
Decades later when she was interviewed she admitted that she deliberately ignored the boys in her classes so she could concentrate on teaching the girls.
Composed by Dave Grusin the theme sends a chill into my psyche when I hear it years after viewing the movie.
On the planet Helion, he encounters Lord Marshal (Colm Feore) and his invading warriors the Necromongers, and when Riddick is imprisoned, he must escape and put a stop to Marshal's evil reign.
Watching the film again on cable reminded me how impressed I was when I first saw it.
This movie was horrible, it made no sense, and then when things started to make a little sense it didn't make the plot any better.
It made me realize why, exactly, we accompany other people to the movies for... to groan together when a movie becomes too unbearable to stand.
The special effects and camera work of the movie does little to save it, but it was at least something to focus on when I couldn't stand the acting (or lack of acting) anymore.
I reply: You don't have to be a cordon-bleu chef to figure out when there's a rat in your hamburger.
Actually, this is a good movie to watch when you wanna have fun with your friends.
I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12.
A girl had committed adultery with a married man when she went to the university, and had a baby which had to be aborted.
Well, when you start with a Diana Palmer novel it is hard to imagine that the result would be any different.
If you happen to fall into the majority of the world's population that isn't Christian, or the even larger majority that isn't *fundamentalist* Christian, you'll get a glimpse into the eerie world of apocolyptic Christian prophecy (or, even worse, a glimpse into what happens when no gay people are involved in the making of a major motion picture).
Security consisted of one person on the front desk who, when as a ruse the "Most Wanted" person in the world is marched past him (and he recognises her), doesn't bat an eyelid.
Please tell me they're kidding when they list *4* of these in a series?!?!?
Fahey finds himself questioning what's going on and when he does he's framed for his partner's murder and forced to flee among the haters.
Carol Alt and Tony Nappo play a blind and a paraplegic people respectively and when they play the game they are healed and become Mancuso's disciples.
Unfortunately because of this disability he remains isolated from being able to take comfort from them when he needs it most.
You might be surprised when I point out that Carter never fought Griffith for a world championship in 1963 though he did fight for the middlewight championship a year later against champion Joey Giardello who beat him on points with plenty to spare .
You might also be shocked to know that Carter was never in fact much more than an average fighter who was well past his prime when arrested for murder so why this movie is making out that Rubin Carter would have been a boxing great if it wasn't for being WRONGLY convicted of murder I have no idea .
Meekly Rubin forgives his captor because that's who Rubin is - A noble forgiving paragon of humility , we're only three scenes into this movie and we're weeping tears for the guy , in fact you have to wonder why such a great guy was ever convicted of murder when he was a decorated war hero with a chest full of medals and we don't have to wait too long because it transpires that the cops are racist .
Thankfully justice is served though be it belatedly when a bunch of Canadians expose this terrible miscarriage of justice and Rubin is set free .
Everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint (except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife) but why wouldn't it-after all, it is his point of view.
Ruben Carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to.
Now i don't necessarily object to softcore films, but when i watch a WIP movie, i have certain expectations.
This is not a genre where plot is all that important, but the story here is weak even when you keep that in mind.
I guess about the worst one I have seen thus far was when the fathers and Lok used a giant turtle shell to maneuver underwater and (ready for this?)
A young, upperclass woman named Thymian is excised from her family when a combination of incidents including her father's affair with the housekeeper, the death of the governess, and her rape by her father's business partner resulting in impregnation causes the family as a whole to send her away (for various reasons, some of which are unknown) to a reformatory.
In fact, why does Thymian want to hide the identity of the father of her baby when she was quite clearly raped?
The whole thing was done in six weeks during the summer when the town was very crowded.
My six year old left the room and asked to be told when the movie was over.
I saw "Lonely Hunter" when it came out, and perhaps 2 or 3 times since then, and it has certainly stood the test of time.
Even when he's talking to his house band we are rarely afforded a glance at who he is talking to, with a sinister high-pitched voice off camera underlining every sentence spoken by David: 'Oh!
I rarely laugh or even smile when I watch this show, which is very seldom , but I keep hearing certain people not all, saying what a great show it is.
Even when there is nothing at all on TV it is still better than The Late Show.
Much more creepy than a made up Satanic demon or something, which most movies usually use when dealing with the occult.
Joe Rock won a Short Subject Oscar for his documentary film 'Krakatoa', but was in Europe when the award was announced.
Later, Oliver Hardy has one nice piece of volte-face acting when he barges into a room, all bombast and bluster, then he instantaneously morphs into a courtly gent (resembling the 'Ollie' of Hal Roach films yet to come) when he sees there's a lady in the room.
An embarrassment to the memory of a great author, and especially so when compared with so many other Dickens films.
There is no doubt about it, but when Hollywood decides to make a cinematic masterpiece, and at the same time draws upon indigenous American social and cultural mores, as exemplified by a writer of the talent of Carson McCullers, the result can be both breath-taking and almost overwhelming.
Her plans are complicated when the sister's suitors return again, and againÂ and again.
It seems quite churlish to excuse a novice director's first feature-length outing (especially when you have not yet made one), and since this director, Marfield, was introduced at "Deepwater's" SIFF screening this past June, his direct and humble appearance made it a film you wanted to like.
Unfortunately, "Deepwater" is fraught with the flagrant over-eagerness and lack of restraint that can plague younger director's first outings (which is forgivable), as "Deepwater" doesn't so much resemble a movie as a does a really long movie trailer, vigorously painting the lily when you're already working with a pretty narrow flower.
And when Coyote's young and lovely new wife Iris (Mia Maestro), initially resistant at first, vigorously seduces Nat and then hatches up a scheme to pilfer Coyote's "reward" money and escape, everything seems to be set.
I saw this movie as a 15 year old when it came out.
I won't dignify it with with any analysis or description beyond that, except to say that there's a brief, hopeful moment when we learn that the setting is a "clinic for the treatment of nymphomania," but alas...
Also, when they get shot, they really get into the whole "death throes" thing.
Having American's flying MIG's, having air-to-air missiles turning into torpedos when they hit the water.
The dangerous ones are when you are contagious for a long time before showing symptoms and then you die.
Lundgren isn't exactly a great actor (which shouldn't matter, because he's an action star), and when he has nothing to work with action-wise a project is doomed from the start.
Basically this film is a very clichÃ© action film that is not in anyway stylish or well scripted but it is funny, notably the bad Russian accents and the puns, one of which had me in stitches when Dolphs sergeant is briefing him on his mission saying "have you ever heard of agent red" and Dolph replies " it sounds like a bad action movie", so at least the makers of this new they were not making a classic, overall this is not horrendous but is still pretty bad,you could quite easily stomach the full ninety minutes on a good day, if only for the hilariously cheesy dialogue but if you have a choice between this and an earlier Dolph flick theplace this nicely back on the shelf.
The virus incapacitates and kills most of the crew within seconds but the terrorists continue to operate fine for a long time when exposed very directly to the virus.
Just when you thought Dolph couldn't stoop any lower he does.
When I saw this film in Sydney when it first came out I thought it was a mini-masterpiece.
but when I rented it in NYC to turn some friends on to it, I found that the film was spoiled by a dopey country and western soundtrack, (ned was from Ireland not the Midwest United States) awful garbage by Waylon Jennings.
and not only that, but you get to see some really weird scenes on the movie (such in the ending when both Kelly's brothers kill themselves in a rather artistic way).
You know it's gonna be bad when the first two lines are: "My friend, what are you doing?
Take a look at her biography and see the time frame where she was in the porn industry and when she got out, adding that 20 years to that date brings us pretty close to the current time.
It seemed that they just decided to kill several cops when they couldn't think of anything better to film.
The best comedy moment (not intended to be funny) is when she seriously wonders what it was that she did wrong.
In fact, we are worried when there are no shootings in the background!
Please don't waste your time or money on this dog, give some blood instead, you won't see any in this movie and when you do you won't care because you're ready to scream from boredom!!!!
I hate when filmmakers can only make a plot move by adding someone for no real reason and then not even fleshing out the character.
You immediately know that you're in for a fun ride here when, in the very first minute or so of the films running time, an impromptu fight breaks out between our hero, played by the always superb Alexander Lou, and a somewhat gaunt looking chap who appears to be wielding what at first sight looks like a piece of guttering!
Anyway, to cut a long story short, our hero and his new found pal next wind up working together at a sewage works, during which time they manage to save the life of a local mafia boss (a strangely benevolent chap at that) when he is attacked by his own cronies who are attempting to overthrow him.
How the hell did Darren Day get any acting part - when I realised he was in it I was totally put off (if you are English you will know all that he has ever done or is famous for is poor seaside style singing and dumping girlfriends at the altar), but I still gave it a chance... And it was abysmal.. French Poirot style detective in England?
However, the only thing that I could notice is that the directors and writer apparently were under effect of acid or LSD when they wrote and shot the film, and the images are probably based on a bad trip.
The fight scenes were filmed slowly, for example when an actor through a punch he made his fist move slowly as if going to pet a strange dog.
Marianne Jean-Baptiste (another fine actor - when is she going to get another part as good as Secrets & Lies?)
And when it came to the drug scenes, I confess I eventually had to fast forward through them, so embarrassing were they.
(He looked like he had a streaky, orange fake tan, a la Charlize Theron at the Oscars)...and my personal favorite, 3) Joshua being randomly British, when all the other actors sounded American.
I had seen it partly when it was new.
Even when there is no apparent arc, for example Lee Marvin in Point Blank, Mel Gibson in Payback, Benicio del Toro and Ryan Phillipe in Way of the Gun, or Warren Oates in Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia, the main characters are of interest and not one dimensional.
Kenta has an eye for digital effects and making every edit seem like an exclamation mark, but he doesn't know when to sit back and let the story tell itself.
An absolutely awful movie that's only redeeming feature is it's occasional moments of unintentional humour, when dodgy camera effects and ham-handed acting produce giggles instead of drama and suspense.
I literally freaked out when my dad taped a football game over it.
It still made me laugh just as hard as when I first watched it.
I don't usually get too upset when I see a bad film but this film had its characters going down this unrealistic road I had to turn off before the accident.
The unrealism comes in when the audience is supposed to believe that someone is writing their Ivy League thesis about the fruit fly.
I saw this film with a group of four and, when it ended, we were all amazed with our patience to sit through two hours of directorial aimlessness, character superficiality and degenerating dialogue, giving the director the benefit of our doubts.
The film had me laughing throughout, like when the two main characters (who dress like oi punks, which added to my enjoyment) trash an establishment owned by a white bigot in the middle of the film for no reason (the scene seemed to be randomly thrown in), the ninjas at the end who turn into clumps of grass and either teleport or travel underground and then take their normal ninja shape again, the special team called in by the ninjas to fight the mafia (who are the protagonists) which includes an italian (i think?)
Some exciting action and tense situations, but credibility is strained when, with the Ft. Holman Gatling gun spraying shot into the parade ground, the Confederate troops show no interest in cover but keep milling in the open like ants from a hill goaded with a stick.
The characters are enjoyable, specially when you see their powers or their KungFu.
It's my fav KungFu movie, I first saw it back in 1993 and taped it when I got the chance...but I lost it.
A few one-liners stand out, like when Goldilocks is caught in the shower "You were expecting maybe Janet Leigh?"
Ultimately though, this is one for those long winter evenings when you're drunk and can't get upstairs.
The soundtrack, the fashions, and the hairstyles, combined with a script that's obnoxious when it wants to be funny, and eye-rollingly stupid when it wants to be scary, sends "Deadtime Stories" to a watery grave in the latrine of '80s nostalgia.
The first story is kind of weird and creepy, and has some good parts when the corpse comes alive.
The second tale is about a werewolf and is only saved by the unintentionally hilarious lines from the old woman, such as when the man demands she open the door, to which she replies "I will not!"
The soundtrack, the fashions, and the hairstyles, combined with a script that's obnoxious when it wants to be funny, and eye-rollingly stupid when it wants to be scary, sends "Deadtime Stories" to a watery grave in the latrine of '80s nostalgia.
The best and by far one of the most painful scenes is when Vincent Price gives us a little lesson in monster genealogy.
The monster masks alone, fashioned by freelance designer Vic Door, who also worked at a milk processing plant, are laughable when compared with those from the Mos Eisley Cantina just three years before - lending understandable succour to the myth that they were made by producer Milton Subotsky's milkman.
In keeping with the Amicus tradition, the film features a handful of not-very-creepy tales, plus a 'comedy' story for light relief, linked by a story-within-a-story - here played out between Price's vampire Eramus (his fangs are retractable when not in use) and horror writer Chetwynd-Hayes himself, played by Carradine.
Two rival ambulance companies battle to be the one that will remain in business when budget cuts strike the town.
Ana doesn't like Alicia and vice versa, so when the bachelorette party for Alicia comes, an uninvited Ana comes along and she as a secret surprise for the party, she hired a male stripper named Rocco (GuzmÃ¡n) to spice up things, 'cause Ana and her friends are very uptight.
I was enthralled when the credits finally started to roll.
The overwhelming impression is that this woman had one source of support and friendship, when the reality was very different.
Everyone else wanders around doing things that are never really explained- except when they make music.
Poorly filmed, the set ups are almost basic and unimaginative, and the scenes of New York and elsewhere were clearly filmed decades after the events take place (Marc Anthony's character had been dead over ten years when Andrew Lloyd Webber's woman in White played the Marriot Marquis.)
Its not bad, its badly made so that you come out knowing less than when you went in.
We all know that HÃ©ctor Lavoe wasn't a saint, and his life was indeed a tragedy from when he became famous on... but the overwhelming feeling you get from all real-life sources of information and trivia that have described his life in the past is that, contrary to the despotic, abusive brute portrayed in the film, HÃ©ctor's character was way more generous, more people-friendly (I'll talk about this in a minute), pained, multidimensional than what we're fed with through Marc Anthony's interpretation.
when they met.
In 1963, Hector Perez was already a promising young singer in his native Puerto Rico when, at the age of seventeen, he moved to New York City to try and make a name for himself as a performer there.
It was two years until the battle of Midway and less than two years until Pearl Harbor when Flight Command came out.
About the only thing interesting in this flick is when one of the young boys moons one of the others.
I first saw it when I was about 13 or 14 years old, so it has a great deal of nostalgic value for me.
The movie like I already wrote starts from the first second on when you hit the play button as a damn good quality thriller!
second, I think the comparisons to Lynch are dangerous, especially when Lynch has already made a movie about a guy who feels disconnected with his wife and the love they used to have, about a guy who finds himself down a bloody path, about a guy who finds himself in a really bad dream, indistinguishable from his reality...
So my consternation spiked when all I saw was a dark hole, and the credits rolled.
I rented this on the strength of imdb comments....I should know better when it comes to "psych thrillers" and "horror genres" that my taste doesnt reflect 3/4 of the population.
I have no problem when a movie contains an ambiguous ending...BUT...when a director leaves the viewer without even THAT MUCH, the film then becomes a "so whats the point of the whole DAMN THING ANYWAY?
I mean when i go to the movie (which is quite often) and especially within the frame of a fantastic films festival i'll do my best to have a good time, i'll bury my expectations and critic sense as deep as i can.
Basically, the film shows how the cliquishness of the more experienced pilots do to a newly arrived ace whose presence threatened the way they did things up to the time when Alan Drake, aka, Pensacola joins the group.
That is when he meets Lorna Gary, who unknown to him is married to the base commander.
Things are funny when they strike at truths that you can relate to.
There is a lesson in their comraderie which is all the more moving when one considers the 1940 date and the skilful stuntwork of the planes for its time.
The major exception is the weird angry burst of energy from the time traveler near the end of the movie when he tells the heroine to "STAY!!!!!".
Especially when the plot substitutes sheer movement and scenery change for intrigue and story arc, which makes the movie an exercise in padding.
I was flipping through the channels when i stumbled upon this movie.
The creatures were pretty cheesy and the plot not terribly exciting, but probably the biggest shortcoming of the show is the gimmicky way they resolved the ending of the film when Spock was blinded when trying to kill off the space barf that had infested him.
Not to mention that she was NINE YEARS OLD when she first got to Mansfield.
Although I know better than to expect a "pure" adaptation of a novel when Hollywood gets hold of it, I was nevertheless unprepared for the horrible mangling this novel received at the hands of the screenwriter.
I pretended to miss the insinuation of her father's having molested her and her sister--there being no other interpretation to be placed on the looks exchanged between the two of them and their mother when he gives Fanny a hug.
The fun really begins when it becomes apparent what the alien menace is, which are an invasion of flying interstellar space pancakes that make up a collective gestalt creature looking to spread it's way across the galaxy.
It needs humanoids who can fly space ships to spread from colony to colony, and Kirk has to face the decision of his career when choosing between whether or not to just go back to the Sulaco and nuke them all from orbit.
This was one of our favorite Star Trek adventures to act out when we were kids because you could use a bean bag as the pretend space pancake and smack each other on the back, beaming it with your wooden shop class phaser to save each other.
This is the type of movie actors appear in when they're trying to revive their dead in the water "career".
Or is he just becoming mentally ill?Well...I don't know what else to say about it.I just found myself sneering when watching it,no shivers,tension or excitement whatsoever.
Simple: their shtick is more tolerable when taken in smaller doses as was the case in DEAD END (1937) and ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES (1938).
starting to grow on me, and I had somewhat high hopes for Spooks Run Wild, because you never know what will happen when Bela Lugosi is on the scene.
I thought this was a parody or something when I watched it.
i remember watching it when i was about 12 years old, and i didnt like it then.
my fondest memory of this movie was when one of the ninjas is stumbling in the bushes doing some bad acting, when he looks to his side and sees the neighbours - a nudist colony.
i laughed harder when bambi's mother died than i did at this movie.
I never told my kids they couldn't watch it, but I could never sit with them when they did.
I watched it when I was young, and it traumatized me!
The way the characters move ranges from glitchy (the way some parts of a character are missing) to beyond ridiculous (when Snow White is walking or running).
It was at the very end when I found out the Shadow Man was really the Prince under a curse that I lost any remaining respect for Malice, the villain.
For example, when we meet the 7 Dwarfelles, the only 3 that actually really speak are Muddy, Sunburn, and Thunderella (who by the way has a terrible and pointless song).
Kirk goes bunkers when he finds out his brother was killed by some strange looking creatures.
As a former nuclear submariner, I'm frequently annoyed when the producers of military movies just make stuff up in the name of dramatic expediency.
I can also overcome this annoyance when the dramatic aspect of the film is worth expediting.
For me, the most ironic scene in the movie was when Rebecca De Mornay asked Powers Boothe "Did we do anything right?"
The only remotely "decent" scene is when the girl gets stabbed to death in her dreams, and she moans erotically as if she's enjoying it.
Apparently much of the footage shot was lost in a fire, so when the film was edited, large chunks were missing and lots of out-takes had to be substituted.
Actually there are a few scenes when the music switches styles every 2 or 3 seconds.
"Purple Rose of Cairo" is a really nice change of pace for Allen, the type of film that will still challenge his audience but also give them the escapist romantic fantasy that we so yearn for when we go to the theater.
The Jean Claude Van Damme original was a symbol of the masculine late 80s action flick.I enjoyed it,but times were different when I saw it.The sequel is moreorless a repeat of that film,a carbon copy in fact,with Hong in the role of Shidoshi and Han in the role of Chong Li.Even the theme of Alex being a thief stealing a sword and then becoming a fighter who earns it honestly is taken from the original movie.There's even (near the end of the film!)
Soon after her arrival, she's told by her wacky mother that love is in the stars for her when Venus and Mars align - and before you can say "Seen that before" an American hunk named Cody appears (have you ever noticed that these guys are always named Cody or Ken?
And when all girls find their perfect guy in the end (no spoiler, that's what we expect from a romantic comedy), the audience does not swoon, but is bound to groan loudly.
SO, when THEIR spouses get together and build a friendship and then eventually sleep together, you have some sympathy for them.
While this might have been accepted by audiences when the film was released, I just felt this was ugly and selfish.
Allen is just so stunningly beautiful, and is a good enough actress, that you wonder why she keeps getting herself trapped in low-budget junk like this when she can do, and has done, much better.
There's sometimes a tendency to take for granted what Woody Allen can do when he makes films "outside the box".
Cecille (Mia Farrow) is the one who takes the full trip down the movie-hole, so to speak, when she meets Tom (Jeff Daniels)- except that Tom is a movie character, who's seen Cecille so many times seeing him in the movie that he walks off the screen and falls in love with her.
But things are complicated by two things- Cecille's brutish, one-track-minded husband (Danny Aiello), and the actor who's really playing Tom, Gil, who also falls for Cecille when he comes to town to rectify the situation.
If anything else it also reminded me of was the recent Pan's Labyrinth, where a little girl left the dire problems of the real world, also with a brutish figure of ugly masculinity, and when in the fantasy world, even a flawed fantasy world, it's much more inviting than what the real world has to offer.
when Tom's invited to the whorehouse) as well as Hollywood pragmatism that gets peeled away slightly.
With a few unforgettable Allen moments, like when Cecille herself goes into the movie (and one character's self-realization after discovering the wonders of, gasp, improvisation), or when Tom can't pay for a meal cause he has 'movie-money', Purple Rose of Cairo is one of those fuzzy but rare treats in the movies where we're reminded why we go to the movies in the first place.
OK, when you are out for a movie like this you don't expect much logic but all the flaws tend to appear when you don't enjoy the movie and thats the case with Heyy Babyy.
What starts out as a mild comedy, turns in to horror and disgust, when these 'so called' lovable guys shouted "bitch" at a crying baby girl after which they dump her outside a church where she almost drowns and dies!
First half was good it really made me laugh & cry but in the second half when Vidia Balan came then got quite boring for some reason maybe because she spoiled it even Shah Rukh Khan's special appearance couldn't save it.
Inspired from Three men and a baby I can't remember when I saw it because it was a very forgettable film as well as this one.
ESPECIALLY when they're in the same band!!
Yet, the only thing more insufferable than "Heyy Babyy" when it's in a playful mood is "Heyy Babyy" when it's being all high-minded and sanctimonious, cranking up the goo to almost unimaginable proportions, as this "angel sent from God" turns three self-indulgent and immature womanizers into hyper-sensitive and morally responsible young men - and the audience into a bunch of oohing and aahing sentimental slobs.
I was hoping the movie would end when Angel's mother took the baby away from them.
I remember when I bought License to Kill with Denzel on the DVD cover.
The prank is that it pretends to be clever in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way, when it's actually moronic in a so-bad-it's-painful-to-sit-through kind of way that I believe violates the Geneva Conventions.
It is obvious why this was necessary when you view the hideous looking performers in the product.
The typical formula when a movie goes in this direction is that some kind of epiphany or chance event propels the character towards a resolution of there problems.
the only joke that i found funny was when she said she had her masters in econ.
It is like making a movie with Paris Hilton and expecting the audience to feel for her character instead of cheering when that character gets horribly dead.
Jane gets stoned, inadvertently gets more stoned when she steals (twice), then ends up in a crazy, random adventure that really was pointless in the end.
And the part when he becomes fat is not believable at all.
It really annoys me when big stars get away with making junk just because of the weight their name carries.
And when moments of comedy come up, they speed by and either hit the mark or miss it entirely (the latter happens a whole lot more often than the former).
And when moments of drama come up, they are either eluded to as still being subtly funny, or just come off as plainly amateur.
He just comes off as being annoying for the most part, and when he is acting with his puppy dog-style "Woe is me!"
So when it comes time to sympathize with him, we can't.
Cecilia is devoutly religious, but Tom has no knowledge of God, because religion does not feature in the plot of his film; when Cecilia explains the concept to him, Tom conceives of God as having the same relation to the real world as the scriptwriter does to his fictional one.
Although the film has a downbeat ending, when Cecilia has to confront the difference between her world and Tom's (where there is always a happy ending), the general tone is light and amusing, a tone set by the acting, especially that of Jeff Daniels in the dual role of Tom and Gil, who have quite different characters.
I'm not exaggerating when I say that after the first half of this movie, the whole film was a big letdown.
The movie took a decidedly dark turn, especially when Christopher Walken revealed himself as the Angel of Death.
What upset me even more was the cop-out ending when Adam Sandler wakes up in Bed, Bath & Beyond realizing the whole experience was a dream.
Additionally, his troubled times come when he fast forwards through waiting for his promotion after months of working on a project.
There should have been a few dramatic points to make the film at least a little bit legitimate, but when it got heavily dramatic, that's when the film really jumped the shark.
he always seems to be doing the "waterboy" voice, even when he isn't trying to.
They should not have had the part where he starts losing control of the remote (basically the whole movie), and when you learn that Christopher Walken's character is really death, I lost all hope.
My fellow film students and I were hopeful when we watched it.
3 points come from the fact that usually when something is really bad, it makes it just a little funny as it is.
Having said that, it is still generally more sweet content than deep and complicated satire- in fact it's just like the popcorn that Daniels' character Tom Baxter first tastes- brittle, the stuff is sweet, and like Baxter says, 'gets annoying when you keep chewing on it'.
Suddenly, a hideously deformed, dying man disrupts the peace when he crashes his car into Pebbles Court, the better part of Homesville.
I never expected a good movie when I rented it.
A severe lack of storyline and any continuity really reminded us all of why Australia is not a name readily heard when discussing great movie moments.
Even the video cover has a picture of him with his left ear cut off when it's his right that gets cut off in the film!
Baxter's ignorance to the real world gives way to some hilarious scenes, in particular when a whore unknowingly leads him to a brothel.
the film reached its logic-nadir when a dead body is thrown into the ocean on long beach, and shortly thereafter (hours?
I found the whole thing depressing when it could have been inspiring.
Watch De Niro's expression closely when he has to say the unutterably bad line.
My family, including my brother who is a massive fan of De Niro (and why not when the guy has a string of truly awesome and unrepeatable characterisations from his early career) came to the conclusion that in America, you can always buy talent, but you can't make them (only make them fake them) drink from the putrid stream served up by Hollywood as "cinema".
For the first part of this film, I regretted having missed some of the cool decrepit sites depicted in the movie when I was in the Long Beach area years ago.
I remember when this film was being filmed in my hometown which seemed so long ago.
De Niro's ex-wife Maggie (some Patti LuPone) is quite hot in the MILF class, you can see her tits in her first scene, when her son comes home at night.
It's fine to have an all gay cast, but when every sketch relies on them acting gay for it's humor, there's a problem with the writing.
It is painfully long, and the only reason I kept watching is because I was waiting for this guy to die, but after legitimately being killed off 5 times: he's poisoned (all of his men die from this poison may I add) yet somehow he has enough energy to walk back through the desert (dehydration), fly a plane, which is later shot down and crashes (miraculously he doesn't get shot/survives the crash), then somehow through all that carries his wife through the desert to safety (she was dying of dehydration/maybe a gunshot at this point) and when she is safe he finally dies, but by then the movie was basically over.
And, it's never a good sign when The Lady Chablis is WAY too old to play herself.
She was supposed to be in her twenties when the story takes place.
She looked every bit the 40's she was at the time of filming, and I have to say that she came across less funny than she did when I envisioned her character in my mind while reading the book.
You know, although I love the Lady Chablis a very great deal (when I'm not busy hating her for wearing tailored skirt suits so much better than I do), you know something is dreadfully wrong with a movie when it has Kevin Spacey and Jude Law in the cast, and Chablis is the one whose performance everybody remembers.
He is first bemused by a man walking an invisible dog -- when in the streets of his character's alleged hometown, people hold conversations with entire invisible people daily -- by the guy in the diner (pretty "fly" for a white guy), and then by the concept that a zillionaire, especially in the South, would keep loaded weapons in the house.
Southerners, when not merely eccentric, are outright freakish.
Fat black women, when not feeding hordes of white people, are practicing voodoo.
Gene doesn't dance a single step, and the only time Deanna sings is when she is expressing undying passionate love for this vicious, psychopathic murderer she is married to.
In this scene we learn that he is taking military leave to visit his fiancÃ©, when he receives a "Dear John" letter saying she has married someone else.
Deanna and Mom sit together in the courtroom, and when the guilty verdict is read, Mom turns to Deanna, slaps her in the face and declares her responsible for sonny going to jail.
The unbelievable part of this plot, is that when she sees him hiding in the back room, she runs to him with open arms, ready to run off with him !
The only message in this movie was, when you're big enough you don't have to care anymore.
(And since, I'm a technological idiot most of the time, who likes nothing better than to blame computers for everything that goes wrong in my life, you can trust me when I say this episode gets a little heavy handed.)
I didn't really mind that, but it seems hypocritical when characters always go on about how fighting is wrong when they usually solve all their problems by fighting.
Pretty pathetic to have her in the lead when you also have actors the caliber of Morgan Freeman and Robert Duvall.
Only good thing is the special-effects in the end when the meteor strikes.
One big tedious, cheesy soap opera about how heroic and unselfish (american) people are when facing certain annihilation.
There was also an strange moment when Nino and Louise suddenly were great pals, walking down the street arm in arm, having only met vaguely before that.
One Instance of this is when her bodyguard somehow turns into her lover over night.
The only genuinely funny moment in 80 minutes is Morley's facial expression when Margaret Rutherford turns up and says "I've come to sit at your feet while my child is being born!"
Even if offered the chance to partake I would decline, I do not need to see such things when stuff like the complete H.R.
He stutters when he's with a girl and starts to feel nervous which I felt was unapprpriate for the movie.
Then we see him making his move towards the victim and them the movie switches to a different scene and then later on in the movie like when we see the killer watching TV or drinking a beer or scratching his rabbit which is his only friend we see flashbacks of what happened between the killer and the unfortunate victim which we should have seen while he was killing the victim.
Sometimes I find her funny, but a lot of the time I find her shtick a little tedious, and where I really like her as a supporting player, when she's the lead I start to get a headache.
The ending comes out of nowhere and makes Paul Rudd's character seem like the antagonist when it is the wife who jacking up on her vibrator and sleeping with every guy who walks around.
Points to consider when you watch this film: photography is sublime and music selection is fantastic.It's a film for romantic people and... well for everyone really.
Now when I saw the film I am totally disappointed.
More problems occur when other Tom Baxters in other theaters want to step out of the movie as well.
Apparently so, which only demands that the flaw of pretension be added to this film's artistic sins, which include treacly sermonizing, such as when Wenders asks, in all apparent seriousness, such banal queries as whether or not telling the truth is dull or exciting.
From the moment when the McElroy character played by Peter Fonda is shot POINT BLANK in the stomach, and not only doesn't die, but lives on to lead the posse after cold-turkey surgery THE SAME DAY, this movie lost me.
And when he gets flung over the cliff his posse pales show great restraint.
Okay, first why steal the title from a classic western if not just to yank a few more bucks from their clients (us) when the so-called remake is butchered beyond belief.
Someone unable to empathize with any worth extended to others, so what's with the aw shucks I guess he's not so bad after all when he's been murdering those after him and his own gang all throughout the whole story.
Apparently no one bothers to theorize that when you are firing dozens of rounds of ammunition at two men who are as close together as they can be without being Siamese twins you just might hit the guy you're trying to rescue.
Apparently, when Russell Crowe's psychotic gunslinging hero-worshiping gang member finally realizes the implications of the above, he figures he better start shootin' them menfolk he'd promised that thar munny to.
Woody Allen tends to rehash his movies a lot, and when he every so often makes a movie that departs from his usual formula, I'm doubly pleased.
You know you're in trouble when watching a film of which the acting sequences are so dull that you start spotting the errors in geography instead.
This film simply passed me by over the years and I finally was able to enjoy one of Woody Allen's great pictures about the depression days when most people escaped from the real world and were entertained by Hollywood and all the dreams that people wished would come true in their lives someday.
I am not kidding when I say that I did not laugh the whole time I was there, it almost felt down right stupid.
This is perhaps the driest performance I have ever seen from Robin Williams.I might have smiled and almost chuckled a time or two,but this film never once made me laugh.Humor that involves raw sewage just isn't very entertaining to me.As a matter of fact(and I say this with no pun intended),it stinks.I have always thought that Robin Williams is at his best when he is improving,and it just seems here that he was not given enough room to do this.It seems like he is going a little too much by the script.It may not be his worst film ever,but it certainly ranks closer to the bottom of the list than it does to the top of it.I recommend all movie goers steer clear of RV and take another road.
Please keep this is mind when reading this review.
you have a man who is too wimpy to tell his boss he won't write a report when he's supposed to be going on holiday.
he clearly should have said no to his boss when he asked him to do this report and just gone to hawaii and saved us the trouble of this terrible and contrived movie.
The ending of the film, even though it's a bit downbeat, was just what the film needed when you realize that dreams are best kept to oneself and in their right place.
Tom doesn't know what a hooker is and when he's picked up by one who takes him to where she works, a bordello, Tom thinks he's at some social gathering with a number of well dolled up high class ladies.
Tom is such a nice guy that when Cecilia"s husband Monk fights with him Tom after he knocks him down, with the old one two, offers Monk a hand to help him up!
In the end Tom, realizing that he's not meant to be in the real world, goes back into the film "The Purple Rose of Cairo" and when the movie is over so is Tom and Ceilia's romance.
Ceilia find the truth out when she goes to the theater and sees a new movie on the screen and as we see the movie "Top Hat" Inter-cut with Cecilia and as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance and sing "Cheek to Cheek".
Cecilia's eyes fill up with tears and then when she realizes that her romance with Tom was a dream but by being a dream, as short as it was,it will never be forgotten and will always be with her forever like the movies that she loves so much.
Yes, when the keycode of a door made some familiar beeps and the other one was when Nielsen was evasing asteroids or something.
The title suggested it might be in the Naked Gun/Airplane style of humor, which when it works is good, when it doesn't can be mildly amusing.
Cecilia only feels alive when she watches her favorite movies that take her away from her dreary realities.
Drastically unfunny, even when it is technically bad.
It ain't Shakespeare but there are times when it is just what I need.
The only redeeming moment was when Dr. Stark, asked if he wants any pie, says "Science is my pie."
I can still get my husband to throw things at me when I sing the first bar of that song...  
His knife-edge existence teeters even closer to the edge when Arab terrorist Malak Al Rahim (Gene Simmons) starts blowing up buildings and people in downtown L.A. First 140 people are slaughtered in a cinema bombing; later Rahim proposes to destroy a chemical plant, wiping out some 30,000 innocent lives in the process!
I remember when a co-worker rented this piece of &*@@!
*$ when we were both doing an overnight shift at the hospital.
And, in the end, we were treated with one of the most gratuitous and violent endings, when he shoved a hang grenade in Simmons' mouth and pulled the pin.
She works in a diner, and when she tries to forget her lousy life in the Depression she turns to the movies.
I have seen this film with my brother back in 2006, when I was 10 and he was 6.
He promised he'll find the most beautiful pearl in the ocean for her (in the film, when a fish gives a pearl to another one, it means the first fish wants to marry the other one).
The other inhabitant of the reef, when they see what happened, rush in to help Pi.
I read that this film was a joint venture between the U.S.A. and South Korea; ugh, what do these two nations have in common when it comes to film-making?
There used to be a time when it didn't matter who was doing the voiceovers and the goal was to create a dynamic and visually impressive experience, not any more it would seem; now we have to have names to fill up the posters and get people in Â but get them into what?
There is one occasion when the animation threatens to pull through and that's when the hero and his girl are above the sea level watching the moon Â the ripples in the water and clouds above seem impressive enough, but that's when you realise the two fish have been above the water for so long, they would've 'drowned' by now.
Also, a point on the joint U.S.A./South Korea set-up is that they're two very different nations when it comes to animation or cartoons.
Now, delivering this sort of message to very young kids is fine, I suppose, but when a film is so inept that it sounds like the voice talent was recorded in someone's living room and the script sees needs-must to throw in homosexual German crabs and a photographer of French decent as well as Jamaican and Southern United State accents for the hell of it, it grates on me.
The film wonders on and Pi eventually undertakes a training routine from a turtle that knows some sort of martial art in which controlling water bursts and moving at high speed are key; Pi only cracks it when he actually builds up enough energy to get genuinely angry.
However, the tears and the laughter quickly dry up when you remember that you saw the exact thing in Finding Nemo or Shark Tale, only better.
Further complications arrive when the character starts walking off the screen in other theaters around the country and the actor who played the character (also Daniels) arrives in town to try to convince his character to go back in the movie.
Jody and Beth wait on the boat for the exact time when the sunlight will bounce off the gold and reveal the mine (for only ten minutes).
Beth nearly drowns when she gets her leg stuck under a big rock and the water level rises - did it ever occur to her that she could sit up?
But when they reach out to grab it, they discover they're larvae.
Surprising, considering the movie takes place in Ancient Greece, or, at least, it's supposed to, but the director decided to say it was in Athens, when all the costumes and sets look like the Victorian times.
Human characters find themselves in random places in between lines of monologues, even in between lines of dialog, where it makes even less sense, when one character is suddenly up a tree.
I tend to think Shakespeare movies tell you more about the period when they are made rather than when they are set (much like the plays themselves), and this one is no different.
There was only one good move when carlito jumped from the rope.. 5/10  Umaga VS Rickflair.
i cannot remember seeing that many people work at the same time, when i visitede the country in 98..
I don't say that all films like this have to be critical to the system, but when you make a film about this many Cubans i find it very strange not to include at least one person who dreams about: another government,democracy, freedom of speech, to be able to travel, to read what he/she wants...the list goes on...a person with dreams like these is not hard to find in Havanna.
I have found (with one or two exceptions) that I like the best when he only narrated, such as in "Radio Days" and "Sweet And Lowdown."
I like it when he leaves the acting to others.
When I thought of it upon waking up this morning with my review gelling in my head (I usually watch films at night then think about them while I head off to sleep--reviews often pop up almost fully formed when I awake), I burst out laughing remembering the character.
There are a couple good sequences, but they tended to be those focused on "action"--when characters were up and about, doing something rather than sitting in a room and talking, and the climax was great (I even cheered).
The only time I thought she was really acting was when she panicked when she was getting covered with moths (and methinks that she was really panicking).
For example, in an early scene when Adamson returns to Britain and is feted at a private ball, instead of using authentic music to nail the period effect and introduce all the elegant and subtle feelings that run beneath the Victorian surface, Balanescu concocts a drone that is an explicit imitation of locusts.
and the hilarious poor acting ["when I touch myself...in the night..."].
The Alibi feels like a premise in search of a plot: Steve Coogan's an ex-con man who's spotted a gap in the market and now provides alibis for cheating husbands and wives only to find himself in the frame for murder when one of his clients accidentally kills a woman.
How often can you laugh at a penis that hums when excited.
In fact, late one night when I had nothing to do, I actually caught a movie where two women in bikinis were sent down to Earth for the sole purpose of having sex with humans.
I just watched this movie on Starz and was riveted when I saw Shatner in it.
His best scene came when David Janssen brought him back on horseback "dead" after a rain storm / landslide or something killed him.
Yeah, so you think its going to be a bunch of predators and a bunch of aliens whoopin each others asses... well its not.... its 3 predators.... and you don't see them or the aliens until after the first hour of humans walking around this temple confused and lost with pointless dialogue and this "I'm going to touch stuff that I don't know what it does yet" frame of mind...  when the 3 predators finally show up.. your thinking YES... carnage is coming... the reason I came to see this movie.... well...
I'm GLAD THEIR F****** BLOOD Isn't ACID YOU F****** MORONS... Oh yeah... Did I mention the blood is only acid when they need to show how scary the aliens are...
If your actually going to fight one you don't have to worry about it... Also, the aliens acid blood apparently has a different effect on different types of materials... for instance, when the predator gets hit with the acid, his body armor is instantly corroded... when the female star's sweater gets hit, its no big deal... soo mental note... wear cashmere when battling any aliens...
I'm glad that after setting off a blast of this size, at around 2000 feet below the ice... that this stupid queen alien thats for some reason 5x the size it was in aliens, can somehow survive when the entire area was vaporized, and climb up a 2000 foot vertical cliff... argh....
For an indicator of how long I have been a fan of the series, I will tell you first off that I saw Aliens when it came out on video tape in the late 80s and saw Alien 3 in theaters, I obviously saw Alien after its mid-70's release, and it scared me like few movies have ever been able to do since.
Since when does a single monologue pass as character development?
Lance's character was horribly dry, unemotional, and when he dies, I didn't care, or even notice really.
The scientists seemed to already know they were in danger when the eggs arose, although they should not have had any clue whatsoever about what the eggs were.
And things just went from cheesy to outright goofy when Lex and the 'hero' Predator(who, without hesitation, murdered about 4 people a few minutes earlier) became friends and teamed up against the Queen...I thought they might even kiss at one point.
One gets killed, and then the remaining two manage to escape when an Alien tackles the Predator.
>_< Damn, I hate it when they do that.
The cherry on top of the sundae was when the wealthy tycoon Weyland, who was organizing the search party, turned out to be the actor who played "Bishop" in Aliens.
I figured things were going badly when the heroes enter a pyramid that they've found thousands (millions?)
Anyway, so when I finally shook myself out of it, there were people that were getting attacked by face-huggers that were bullet-timed a la the Matrix (and every other action movie since).
Woody is fantastic when he is on screen, but this film benefited from losing his neurotic nature, and instead concentrated on the era, the love of movies and the complex themes of a movie within a movie.
When I heard Anderson was in charge of this project, I knew that it couldn't be good newsÂ.and then when the PG-13 rating came along, my fears were multiplied and confirmed.
Why in the hell would Predators set up an entire human civilization to perpetuate their ritual Alien hunts and bring weapons with them that melt when they come in contact with Alien blood?
Once the human drama is set up, who cannot help but feel for the survivors as a marine's face is melted by Alien blood, or when a train full of commuters are torn to pieces by a Predator who doesn't fully understand what is going on around him?
Those parents who complained when the studio didn't accommodate them because they were too stupid to realize a film based on a video game which is in turn based on Night Of The Living Dead might not be a good babysitter, I hope you are proud of yourselves.
So when the intrepid humans decide to go and check it out, the Predators oblige them by firing a beam from Earth's orbit into said polar cap, tunneling the thousands of feet needed to find the entrance.
Why did they decide to put the F word in earlier when it wasn't necessary, yet cut it out later when it was?!
What happened to him between where the movie ended and when he died?
I am a fan of both drug and prison movies so when I was recommended this movie I had some pretty high expectations.
I can't empathize with someone who falls for a man who spent 18 years in the joint running a prison gang and is then surprised when he turns out to be a user and fake and not a social reformer.
Having survived this torture i was so excited when the movie begun.
See for yourself, when you don't believe!
I became a Julie Harris fan after seeing her in East of Eden when I was a very young man.
But when a film is so obviously leading in one way with characters drawn with the largest strokes...it becomes a cartoon...and not a very funny one at that.
Yes, she's playing a klutzy ditz with a heart of gold, but Long has no shadings, and when she tries for sincerity it rings hollow (even her overly-clear speaking voice sounds as if it's coming from an echo chamber and not a person).
The plot also hovers between scientific miracle and occult fantasy, when perhaps one approach would have sufficed.
Then, when this video came out (as part of Great Performances on PBS)I was thrilled to see how close it was in conveying the actual stage performance.
Bank shots being played when a direct shot is available.. etc.
The stupidity of this movie especially shines through when Johnny is having some trouble in the climatic final game versus Brad, who is revealed to be the 13th ranked pro pool player in the US.
That's when Nick (Rod Steiger), the grizzled old hustler who owns the pool hall the match is being played in, reassures Johnny by saying "Don't worry.
"-I thought when I prepared to watch this one.Was I disappointed after the projection.
He is about to be transferred from the sanitarium he has been housed in when, surprise surprise, he breaks out.
But I guess with youth comes the ignorance of the past - I mean, I wasn't around when the original Oceans 11 came out so liking the new one is probably a big disappointment to those who WERE around at that time...so I guess you all can see where I'm coming from.
I hate it when folks hate something they haven't even saw or tried.
And then maybe when I'm even older and I've lived long enough -- this crowd will be watching this on TV Land and saying the same thing when another program by another youngster that is just the same comes out.
Even when she is in danger, Jennifer Garner keeps on looking like she is making a spread for Vogue.
Hard to blame the actors when the script is so inane and one-dimensional.
And for a bunch of supposedly mentally toughened CIA agents they do fall apart when family comes up.
The film asks the question..."What happens when a group of indi film makers go into the woods to find a fictional beast?"
So when you see this playing on Sundance or IFC, please take that into consideration.
If you want to see a truly great fake documentary, I highly recommend GHOSTWATCH - an excellent piece of work that is carefully scripted, genuinely puts you on the edge of your seat, contains great scares and still makes you question what you've seen even when you know it's a phony.
I saw this film a long time ago, just when it was new (1982) and was blown away by the very talented Mr. Keaton.
A small, early gem from the Ron Howard-Ganz-Mandel team, with some personal touches, to wit: The line when `Belinda' (Shelley Long) tells `Chuck' (Henry Winkler) just after they made love that `she is not wearing her watch' to let him know that she loves him is just beautiful, a nice, semi-polished little gem that I think most people can appreciate and enjoy.
Characters inexplicably will not keep the camera still (a really annoying scene showing this is when David Beard is filming himself in the woods towards the end and keeps revolving).
Lines from the trailer:  "Remember what mother said would happen when I became a woman?"
I could go on, except I will be going off track and forgetting to tell you about the time when they decided to make the terrible "Return of the Blue Lagoon" based on the terrible "Blue Lagoon" which must have had the makers of sequels and rip offs scratching their heads.
Unlike the way the first one ended, Richard and Emily are dead when they are found, but their son, Patty soon renamed Richard after his father is adopted by the only mother on the ship, Sarah who has another child, a daughter, Lily played by a new successful actress, Milla Jovovich.
I reach to a conclusion: Monica Bellucci is a good actress when her role doesn't oblige her to speak.
He is an outstanding actor, and during the film I kept asking myself what the hell is he doing in this movie?..Does he understand fluently French when he read the script?..Well, I hope that I'll never see him again in a movie like this.
Its such an "exciting" film and I was so "intrigued" by what was happening that I didn't bother to finish the film when the DVD I wigged out and wouldn't play, I simply put it into the returns slot and let someone else deal with it.
This flick confirmed many lingering suspicions, and none too pleasant: 1) Jack Black is a great comedic character actor who can easily be strangled by a poor script (he's at his best when he can bounce off of comedy writers like David Cross and Bob Odenkirk); 2)anything produced by MTV pictures is destined to suck; 3) an all-star cast (John Lithgow, Kevin Kline, Catherine O'Hara, Harold Ramis, Chevy Chase, Lily Tomlin) should be a signal that the material can't stand on its own.
This movie was during a period in Keaton's life when he was only known for his comedy, and he definitely peaked with it here.
This is the tripe Hollywood produces when untalented people are told they are talented.
There are numerous examples but Sam's treatment of both Katie and Claire is pertinent, as is Uncle Curtis' slap of his girlfriend when she interrupts his cretinous musings and Trife's initial reaction to Alisa's pregnancy.
The material covered had a lot of potential but it was executed in such an uninspired and predictable manner that I have to say I was extremely happy when it ended.
when i see a movie review with such polarized opinion, i want to give it a chance.
I mean, when we watch "Ghostbusters" for example, we know that the script is a cartoon and no one stops to consider if it could have happened.
While I do commend those who attempt making a movie, I cannot say something is good when it's plainly not.
This movie isn't good...and when I shelled out the rental fee, I paid for the right to say so.
They had small parts like when a woman is shown for 2 minutes and is killed.
There was parts when i felt like turning it off but I had nothing else to do.
Nawab loses his leg when he tries to take revenge.
John Woo's Ying Huang Boon Sik/A Better Tomorrow(1986) was groundbreaking when first released because of the stylistic depiction of the action scenes.
Began a trend in fashion around Hong Kong when many people started wearing the same kind of outfit as Mark Gor.
I enjoyed it when Mark Gor places guns inside flower pots as backup because the idea is cleaver and original.
Arnold has some moments especially when he allows greed to lead to his downfall.
There's a scene inside the slaughterhouse, when the fat killer is above one of the businessmen and taunts the businessman with a weapon.
Even when I first saw it years ago, I wasn't too impressed.
The last survivor escapes in the Deputy's car, kills Lester and just when you think it's safe, Buddy comes leaping out of the back seat and kills her.
I was eleven years old when this second Power Rangers movie came out.
So, I was still a big fan when this film came out (I was even still a big fan a year later), and remember watching it over and over for a while.
Now, sometimes when a movie is bad, it can be unintentionally funny.
As a straight male, there's one thing I got out of this movie that I wouldn't have when I was eleven, which was the looks/physique of certain female actors, including Nakia Burrise and Catherine Sutherland who play Tanya and Katherine (the two female Rangers of the time), and I guess even Hilary Shepard who plays the dreadful main villain, but this obviously didn't make the entire film for me.
This movie was when I started to get a tad disillusioned with them.
Saw it once at 9-10 years old did not care for it although I was syked when I heard Jason (Austin St. John) the original Red Ranger and the greatest ranger of all time period!
The only good scene in this film was when Rocky (Steve Cardenas) performed a goofy martial arts move that injured his back, and having his place in the martial arts tournament replaced by our heroic Red Ranger Jason (Austin St. John).
i suspect that they ran out of money when they were filming and just went with what they had.
  I saw this film a long time ago, just when it was new (1982) and was blown away by the very talented (and hyperkinetic) Mr. Keaton.
A small, early gem from the Ron Howard-Ganz-Mandel, with personal touches, to wit: The line when `Belinda' (Shelley Long) tells `Chuck' (Henry Winkler) just after they made love that `she is not wearing her watch' to tell him that she loves him is just beautiful, a nicely semi-polished little gem that I think most people can appreciate and enjoy.
There are some movies so bad,that when you watch them on video or TV,you wonder, "Why did they bother with this?"
That's what I wondered when I caught this unoriginal,clichÃ©' filled movie on late night TV.
I really only got into the movie when the more truthful and real elements came into play.
And when he REALLY gets in trouble - no problemo, he's got an even more-indestructible side-kick who always appears in the nick of time.
I was on the verge of crushing the DVD when I considered that there might be some resale value--to some eager young child, or mindless schlub such as myself.
You'll learn so much about stolen shots and when the sex is real and when it's not.
Then, she seems surprised when he tries to sneak out in the morning.
She's expecting to go over her script for Cleopatra but when she opens the door to his shabby multicolored garbage-strewn room she finds him lurching about, his pants unzipped, jerking in spasms, and managing to moan: "I've been an alcoholic for four years -- and now I'm on SMACK."
She winces when he crawls atop her and tells Keith that she's never made love before.
Her lost love appears in the distance, silhouetted by a halo of bright light -- so bright that she must blink when looking into it.
As it is, I think Argento was right when she said we might get to know her better.
But when opportunistic Billy Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) takes a job in the morgue, things change for the crazier.
Am I the only one who started to yawn when people were getting pounded over a loud soundtrack in "Casino"?
I didn't know who directed the movie until the credits when the name Scorsese popped up, so I saw the movie without any expectations.
The love triangle drama was just pathetic, why would she date some ex con with drug problems when she's already moving in with Sullivan, a career cop who climbs the latter in the department like a sky rocket (i.e.
The only part that surprised me positively was in the end when the other mull showed up and blew Costigans brains out, I didn't expect that one.
Tedious where it should be crackling and dull when it should be suspenseful, Marty and crew have made a nasty cinematic mess that really does not deserve the all-too-predictable praise that's been heaped on it.
Apparently the writers were handicapped when it came to vocabulary.
Supposed hard man Leonardo looks as enraged as a poodle when the canine beautician has gone a bit to close to his ear with the electric clippers.
And when I read a magazine, the director denied and said it's only inspired by.
But all my dream has gone when I saw "Departed".
But it seems to me that when a story is developed on the strength of a collection of main characters, the story had better wind up focusing on the relationship between them.
Another stupid omission was the friendship between the police informant and his boss, which was meticulously staged in Infernal Affairs, and culminated in a tragic climax when the boss fell off the building and landed right in front of the informant.
This scene was attempted in Departed but failed miserably when Leornado tried to look sad when his boss died.
I am MAD because of the disregard of respect on the part of Scorsese's team, not giving the credits when credits are due.
Even when Orlando changes sex I did not find her acting to be of the required emotional depth, although the script was probably partly to blame for this.
I was stone cold sober when I watched it on television this time also.
The writing is quite lousy... clichÃ©s are plentiful, it was drenched in naivety, predictability abounds, the story never really captivates(in spite of its title, I could easily see people falling asleep during it), even though it manages to rip off far more established sci-fi titles(including Independence Day and The Day The Earth Stood Still... the latter being from when obvious messages in this genre were at least more accepted and usual, and actually a well-produced piece of celluloid; this was simplistic, offensive... modern propaganda).
It should be noted that we only got to see these first two episodes, as our local ABC affiliate chose to air pre-season football instead of the two episodes following it... and ABC buried it in a spot in the summer, when they would be watched by hardly anyone.
The only realistic moment in this whole scenario was when the French agree to capitulate to the ETs, and then that was made into a joke by having the US react to that with surprise.
Note to the writers and producers of this series: We already know what happens when an extraterrestrial force arrives looking like a "God" and appears to be benevolent, and are welcomed.
Just when you thought the nail couldn't be pushed any deeper into his coffin, Kennedy is back, and this time in a movie like Malibu's Most Wanted, or rather a movie where he is acting like a stupid white guy: Kickin It Old Skool!
But the humor didn't last long when it cut right back to a joke about stupid white Jaimie Kennedy, just to ruin the good mood!
I was about to tell my family we were leaving, when my 11 year old asked, "Can we GO, now?"
Therein lies the fault of Kickin' It Old School, its assumption that there is something virtuous in acting like a 13 year old, and an immature one at that, especially when it's writers are thirty something, and throwing their best material into the mix.
Perhaps Kennedy lost me when he started rubbing his fat best friends breasts, thankfully covered in a bra, but it seems that he often forgets which subplot he's working with, or rather what the main plot is altogether.
Bobby Lee slips in and out of a stereotypical Asian parody that becomes MIT alum when he whips out his big vocabulary words, he is much more effective and funny in sketch comedy when he is no forced to extend his performance for more than five minutes.
I wasn't going to write a review but I had to do something when I discovered IMDb has nothing lower than 1 star.
It is not a bad thing that Our Heroes "win" the day, but that they win without any effort; they win when others are so clearly superior; they win by being the biggest retards on stage - and that is supposedly how you win.
Especially when the other's gun goes off prematurely on his foot!
Though Lumley had a low key, but when Belinda came into his life, he became stronger and puts his foot down on those who pushed his aside.
But when Alicia (Lainie Kazan) learns about the letter and the ring sent by her former beau Nick (Tony Lo Bianco), her inexplicable response is to continue to be angry at him!
Not a good review for a movie when you can say that.
there's nothing i hate more than when characters in horror movies catch on too quickly, and these people were freaking savants in that regard, especially toward the end.
It might sound like a hollow recommendation coming from one small man on the internet out there somewhere, but I guarantee when more people see this film, it will become a legendarily cult bad film, in the same way 'Troll 2' and 'Manos' are now.
Our heroes have no money to pay for their escort so the gypsies appropriate Selleck's West Point ringÂyeah, right, what was he thinking when he brought it on this missionÂand Whitmore's watch.
Whitmore pretends to be a plumber taking a roadside break when German motorcycle troops discover his presence and escort him to the winery.
Whitmore and Selleck play reasonably well off each other, but they are thwarted by embarrassing dialogue, especially when they are voicing themselves over in long shots.
All hell and hilarity break loose when the boys decide to go into business as pimps.
This film lost all appeal for me when I started laughing about five minutes into it.
Why this flimsy film was made in the first place seems only due to lasting resentments on the part of the Australians at the arrogant and crude behavior of Frank Sinatra when he made an appearance in Sydney during a world tour: he insulted the press, caused the labor unions to react in defiance by cordoning off his connection to the world outside his darkened hotel suite and demanded an apology from the star, an act that Sinatra refused to do.
Frank Sinatra (Dennis Hopper playing Dennis Hopper) arrives and one of the Press who alienates Sinatra is Rod's girl Hillary (Portia di Rossi) and when she asks inappropriate questions, Sinatra calls her a hooker and there begins the furor of the Aussies.
What passes for a plot centres on the infamous Australian tour of 1974 when Sinatra spoke his mind as usual and wound up a virtual prisoner in his hotel room until honour had been satisfied.
The cinematography is great, specially when it shows the wild horses being chased and captured.
The lessening of the budget means that Tremors 3: Back to Prediction uses footage from the original Tremors & the CGI computer work isn't the worst around but it does look a bit shoddy at times especially when the main monster looks so silly.
It also takes away from the film when you know someone else is singing, not her!
And when Michael Keaton is driving and flipping off the cops, come on, what is not to love.
Everyone is great in this movie, Winkler, Keaton, Long, Belzer, when I was young I dreamed Shelly Long would make me eggs.
The shock value of being "bad" is something a lot of us worked through when we were pre-adolescent.
It's hard to laugh at jokes about abnormalities when the main character is almost deranged himself.
I'm glad it came along when it did, because I was painfully close to ejecting the tape.
Shelly Long stars as a working girl and strikes up a friendship and even a love making encounter with the uptight Lumley who breaks free of some of his tightness, which was needed especially when he had a sweet tooth wife who loved chocolate!
In the end a lot is learned as unexpected love is discovered and all three form a bonding friendship that's memorable and should last so special when it seemed so unlikely.
But sadly as is always the case when you expect something brilliant you rarely feel satisfied, and for me this was an extremely unsatisfying film.
Actually he didn't annoy me throughout entirely, when he didn't speak in that stupid idiot voice he was OK, the rest of the time he was Peewee Hermin.
But, in the Misbehavors(most disgusting, disturbing thing I've ever seen)he was angry and yelling at the kids and when he saw the dead hooker in the bed he threw up and almost made me.
Then, in the last story when he was going to cut off Norman's finger in some sick bet Chester, Leo and Norman made he had no problem yet he couldn't even have sex with the women in the beginning of the movie and was throwing up all over the place in the Misbehavors.
This is what happens when creative people think they can do anything and it will work.
Its also what happens when "hot"celebrities are allowed to make a joke thats nothing but a self serving in joke.
I presume the director was trying to show us something about the lives of children when they're alone together by filming them up close, letting them do their own thing, and not including anything else that would intrude (such as a plot or dialogue).
And when you're that bored, you start to question the point of watching scenes of kids sitting on the toilet, or hanging around the house naked while playing music.
The movie is pretty funny but it feels to much like Naked Gun, and especialy when Leslie himself is in it.
I bought it on DVD since I last saw it when I was a kid and I thought that it could make me laugh.
I was happy enough with the Naked Gun films when they were first released.
To be honest, I am rather ambivalent towards Howard's supposed talent as a film-maker: well-suited to light-hearted, life-affirming fare such as this, SPLASH (1984) and COCOON (1985), he has regrettably failed to convince when tackling more serious subjects.
Consequently, there are plentiful felicities throughout (not least an early rendition of the Burt Bacharach/Rod Stewart song "That's What Friends Are For") in the way of situations (notably a running-gag involving Winkler being chased by a hound let loose in the corridors of his apartment building) and dialogue (particularly when, ending up in prison and being accosted by a murder-happy cellmate, Winkler sarcastically thanks Keaton for having made possible his acquaintance with Peter Lorre's son!).
You always know a film is in trouble when a character explains the technicalities of the plot to another character solely for the audience's benefit.
So honest, in fact, that when she gets OLDER, I am going to make my 12-year-old aspiring Chef read it before she decides in fact to spend oodles of money on Culinary school.
Billy is an idea man,(he wants to feed mayonaisse to tuna to simplify the process of having to mix the mayo with the tuna) while Chuck is seems less and less content spending time when he can alone with his neurotic girlfriend.
As Laura investigates her sisters whereabouts she learns Martha & Veronica lied to her & when another young attractive tourist named Helen Miller (Lone Fleming) mysteriously disappears Laura is convinced all is not as it seems at the guest-house...
It's always difficult to comment on acting when people have been dubbed, here the English dubbing is pretty terrible although maybe Geeson spoke English on set.
I just was dumb struck when I received "It Happened at Nightmare Inn" on DVD, it was packaged as a double feature with "Legacy of Blood".
But, the problem I have with this film(..despite the frustratingly questionable acts by the girls when up against the psychopath who locks them inside the house)is that the menace isn't the least bit convincing thanks in part to the performance of Frye.
And, even when they do subdue him, the girls allow him to get free!
Of course, there's no connection to the first two- why the killer chooses to use a drill when a knife, a machete, a gun, or any number of other things would make more sense.
This is still a pretty bad and silly simplistic typical slasher but when being compared to the previous sequel "Slumber Party Massacre II" this movie is a step up from that one.
The story gets basically thrown overboard when the killer makes his entrance to the party.
There's one moment of sheer hilarity when the psycho surprises a guy at the door with his large, high-powered drill, sending a half-dozen lingerie-clad babes shuffling back and forth in front of the camera in a panic.
Chuck, it being part of his nature to always do things safely and not too spontaneously, gradually becomes annoyed with Bill, especially when Bill's ideas start to get him in a whole lot of trouble.
The dialogue is just absolutely silly (like when Bill and Chuck are fighting in the office and all Bill can say is as he's crashing through glass and junk is that Bill should be careful because Chuck's wearing white).
The scientific rhetoric leaves itself open for logical criticism, and when the smaller meteorites hit Asia and the Alps, we are treated to some very tacky archival and stock footage.
ten times stronger than the strongest earthquake; it's more like a million times stronger, 3) It's impossible to redirect a meteor when it's only days away from impact (again, nit-picking, or maybe they didn't know that then - though I doubt that), 4) it isn't possible to destroy a meteor that big (and that fast) with a series of nuclear hits, 5) One of the space centers only discover a big one going towards NY when it's just minutes away from impact!
7) It should have been more devastating; they showed it's impact to be more like that of a huge earthquake than a meteor, 8) the absurdity that governments would actually think about politics when the future of the entire planet is at stake - and that they actually need convincing that warheads need to be used?!
Still we do have the spectacle of Karl Malden having a severe hair malfunction during the 'money' shot when the Hudson river, or what looks like either (a) chocolate soup, or (b) sewage, engulfs the assembled anti-Meteorites.
And the bi-national musical themes sort of merge when the missiles join up together.
Mind you, when you're locked up in those command centers underneath New York you tend to get a bit, er, undiscriminating.
It may have been highly regarded when it came out, but compared to the others in the series it is quite weak.
Why did they allow Roger Moore to continue playing Bond when he was over 50??
The increasing globe trotting nature of the nutty Q (Desmond Llewellyn) is quite absurd also, remember way back in the early Bond's when he was just a common functionary in the bowels of the secret service building.
Unfortunately the insane pace of cutting from one shot to the next when there's action going on will cut on anyone's enjoyment and attention.
Now he works a peaceful, low stress job at the city morgue - but things change when he's forced into working the night shift.
However, there are other instances when it looks as though the movie is being acted out by a bunch of friends in a warehouse or derelict flat.
I'm sure this was a better movie in its native language but when dubbed in English it's impossible to understand.
invite Guests onto your show and then cut off their Microphones when they voice an opinion that is different to your own.
I never thought the day would come when I'd be defending Fox News, but it has to be said that many of the clips are taken out of context or otherwise distorted.
An even better example of the blatant distortion is when they show Bill O'Reilly responding to criticism that he always tells his guests to "shut up."
One night, Kyle and Hunter are tracking an outlaw when the dog runs ahead of his partner.
Also, when the dog himself is on the screen or his friends, animal lovers will be happy as well.
I'll admit it gave me a few laughs but that was mostly due to the horses having so short legs making them look ridiculous when they galloped.
I am just glad I can't speak Swedish (and had to read subtitles), when you listen to the talking you can just tell it would be even more embarrassing to listen to it proper than it would be reading the subtitles.
Another dehumanization of the USSR, especially when it was it had only 6 years of existence left.
The actor that portrays the investigator is quite amateurish while the lead that plays the female part is awful { take not of the beginning when she is in the detectives office and they are talking.
But when small technicalities get in the way of justice, you have to compromise your morals and let rapists and murderers on the loose--just because the police may have performed a search without a warrant, or taken garbage out of a truck before the lever was pressed and it was dumped into the back with everyone else's trash, thereby becoming "trash" and not the garbage of a certain individual.
After having to let two child murderers go free on a slight technicality, Stephen Hardin (Douglas) decides to join an underground community of judges who take matters into their own hands when bad guys are let free--by hiring hitmen to assassinate them.
And I don't feel personally insulted when a film tries to make us empathize with its characters by having them go through certain events.
It begins intriguingly, like a half-breed of 'The Parallax View' and early Grisham - a high-suspense legal thriller that hits the audience with a gripping, involving problem: a young judge (Douglas) is so faithful to the law that he sends a number of sociopaths free on legal technicalities, and then feels overwhelming guilt when innocent citizens are murdered by the scum he released.
After 52 minutes, when the plot was finally underway, I was still waiting for something suspenseful.
And when they uncover three suspects behind one of the movie's main criminal cases?
Plus, when Toto's all grown up, he starts seeing another woman just because she's a lot like his sister who blew up!
Like an egg, or one of those really smelly French cheeses that ooze everywhere when you cut them."
How comes a woman doesn't recognize the man she loves, just 14 years after he's disappeared, and when it happens that much more than half his face looks exactly the same it was?
In particular, he says "oke" (pronounced like "oak") about three dozen times when he means to say "okay".
Most historians agree that the "taming" of the west occurred when women began arriving in greater numbers--before then, men of the region spent the majority of their time getting drunk and killing each other and the Indians--and someday that would make a really good movie.
Or is it a case of acting naive and passing the responsibility of plagiarism to your Gujarati fan when one finds out?
Just when you think it couldn't get any worse, some ridiculous plot twist comes flying in from the clouds.
It's only bad when you pay attention to the actors or the script.
(In "Karaula" they're, of course, led by a wise-crackin' Belgrade bad boy and his constantly smiling Dalmatian tag-along buddy - all of which seems lifted straight from that 'Bolji zivot' episode when Boba (Dragan Bjelogrlic) goes to the army and is entrusted with forming a multi-ethnic band.)
Same plot as always when it comes to Yugoslav film school-everything begins with funny plot and everyone think it will end funny, too.
They and Sean Connery (as villain Sir August de Wynter) are merely cyphers in this movie, and when could you ever have said that before about Connery, even if he does wear a bear suit?
but when you get the worst migraine you've ever had trying to comprehend why you sat through this pile of dung, you have noone to blame but yourself.  
It's not hard to imagine audiences feeling a bit short-changed when it first came out, especially as the film was a big-budget, would-be summer blockbuster.
This is the kind of movie making that really has you wonder if you should ever visit a theater again, when you consider the waste of millions of dollars on sets, special effects and high-powered actors that could have been used for such better causes (such as, oh, say a big-screen version of "My Mother the Car").
I was ridiculously excited for the arrival of this film and had nauseated all my friends when the project was first announced about who was to be our two spies.
*The killer himself, is a minor character until the end, when he is revealed.
when the killer is revealed.
What to do when the movie you love is unavailable?!?
Another thing that annoyed me were all the false endings: you had no idea when they'd finish the movie and when they do, it's a total cop-out!
In fact, the plot is "tricking you" into thinking it's going to get good, and then when you're interested again, it's like - "hehehe... got you sucker...", and then continues to unfold as lamely as you subconsciously assumed it would after the first 15 minutes.
She's beautiful, but a big mistake was committed when someone out there thought that models could act.
Too long and too slow; the plot is difficult to follow and unnecessarily obscure;in addition, the permanent noises , especially of trains, makes it difficult to hear the actors, especially when the reason for the title of the film is given, if it really is.
This film suffers where many first time films fail (gay or straight) when a director chooses to film their own script.
These are two good actors(Vaughn is good when he doesn't try to be comedic), but nothing they do saves this movie.
I watched 'Friends' seldom but when I did, it was because I liked looking at her.
My god when I think of that script and most of the dialog I want to cringe.
This film made production budget wise at 150 mil (But when you see that figure multiply by 3 for what the film really cost in marketing and prints the production company (distributor) has to get to the screen and all the other costs involved.)
I felt when we left the theater that Aniston and Vaughn had so little chemistry it's hard to believe they developed a romance off the set.
By the same token, if you're going to make Aniston's character the kind of person who would put up with this behavior for so long, she would NOT in real life totally change her mind about him a few days after sobbing in her bedroom about their relationship when he finally makes the list of changes she wants (minus the bowl of lemons and ballet tickets he should have had on that table with the dinner).
Not much redeeming in this film a few short laughs, one of the better ones being when their real estate agent friend offers to sell their home and wants to do so at no commission.
2 of the bandmates were sexually abused when young, then one of them is raped, another dies in an accident, while the remaining one is a drug addict.
Certainly, one has to go deeper when talking about this movie.
I saw this movie when it first came out and was impressed by its slacker(the film)-like construction.
This film is basically an excellent illustration of what sought of art results when an artist completely ignores his/her responsibility to his or her country and people in times of difficulty.
There are people who think that anything which "provokes a response" must be great art, but I've never heard anyone actually advance a reason for believing something so ridiculous, especially when the response is as automatic as a wince.
The high light of the movie was when Ethan Hawke, playing an inept grocery store stocking clerk, kept dumping his load of boxes off the dolly.
I only laughed twice and that's when his friend was moving boxes on the cart and they fall over twice.
This cyclical nonsense keeps rolling almost to the end, when finally, the policemen kinda/sorta/maybe think they have their man.
I was therefore eager to see this film when it came out.
The main character's partner, played by Bruce Dern, is brought up short repeatedly when he makes wrong moves with witnesses, or says the wrong thing, so often that I expected an explosion.
It's hard to like a show that panders to the lowest common denominator of cop show watcher so quickly in its run, especially when within five episodes the chief is already engulfed in a crime mystery.
Good luck Ving when you inevitably return to the small-part tough guy roles in summer flicks you are destined to play.
Jane DID NOT tell St. John Rivers her real name when she got there.
It makes me feel old and long for the days before reality TV ruled when good drama and sitcoms proliferated.
She seems to think that Jane is some feminist archetype, bold and sassy...when in reality Jane, because of years of oppression at Lowood knew "her place" yet, was so good, she answered Edward's questions truthfully...even if her answers seemed bold.
Miss Morton also make some rather unusual facial expressions, she smiles when she hears she will meet the elusive Mr.
This is the more a pity because with Samantha Morton and CiarÃ n Hinds they had two good actors, who even physically fit their roles well, but, alas, the greatest talent is of no avail when the concept of the characters is as wrong as in this adaptation.
Rochester insulting Jane when she intends to leave him, bullying her, throwing her suitcase over the banister and telling her to go if she does not love him enough to stay?
If I came into this film with no understanding of how the US Government screwed the Sioux out of their land (and this was the case), I still have no idea how, when, where, or why this happened.
What a delightful moment when you fully understand that you do not belong to the masses of mysticism loving, astrology loving, lame brained losers out there.
Although, by the end of the movie, I was fairly convinced that people just wanted to laugh in order to avoid the awkward situation of silence when laughter is almost expected.
It reminded me of when a lousy comedian takes the stage and you get a few people laughing at things that are completely not funny just because it seems to be the thing to do.
There are times when I found myself laughing and I wasn't sure if I was supposed to or not.
Now, four movies later, many of his fans are wondering when he will reveal a movie as amazing as The Sixth Sense.
And then there were the random shots, like when it showed the sign of The Cove while people were dying.
It hurt me inside when it happened.
so when Paul Giamatti wakes up in his bed and finds what appears to be a pre-pubescent, half-naked teen staring at him, he should freak out and say, "What the f*** are you doing here and who the f*** are you??!
The music's not bad, with a kind of tango-ish quality, but those words...   "Out of the silence come and cling to me / Out of the silence come and bring to me  That feeling of contentment when you're near / And that feeling of resentment will disappear   When out of the silence comes the sound of your voice / My heart goes leaping; I can't help but rejoice   I'm up in heaven from the bottom of the sea / When out of the silence you come to me"   By the end of the movie Bob stops wearing his dress and puts aside his blond wig.
And it was this part of the relationship that made their two characters so interesting when thrown together.
And when Tony's girlfriend, Ferris, (a voluptuous Jennifer Tilly) who is a stripper ask the men to "wack" her step-mother (Lainie Kazan), all chaos breaks loose.
Two: when he does have something to say, it's always more enjoyable than anyone else in the film.
And when you see a cast including Burt Reynolds and Richard Dreyfuss you can't help but feel cheated when it doesn't live up to the hype.
The worst case was near the beginning when Lee was supposedly almost killed by a falling light.
In addition, to add another creepier element, Brandon was killed in an on-set accident where he was killed by a prop gun---something that is in the plot of GAME OF DEATH--when a bad guy pretends to be using a prop gun but really shoots Bruce in the face!!!!
Second, the female co-star Colleen Camp very ably sang the final song in the film but when they show her singing earlier in the movie, she's obviously out of sync with the music.
What did Golden Harvest Studios get when they spliced fifteen minutes of Bruce Lee demo footage onto a clumsy, poorly-written mess full of Mafia heavies, motorcycle-riding thugs, and faded Hollywood stars like Gig Young and Dean Jagger?
Single worst moment: about five minutes into the film, when a picture of Lee's face is pasted to a mirror, and the neck and shoulders of one of the doubles are placed immediately beneath the photo.
I saw this series on the A&E channel when high quality films were the norm for this cable network.
This movie will trick you, because the DVD cover has Bruce Lee's picture on it when it's not even a Bruce Lee movie.
Most of the time you have an actor dressed up with hair in his eyes and large glasses like the kind wives where when the get beaten, to cover up that its not Bruce Lee.
There's an uncomfortable echo of the death of Brandon Lee when Lee's character Âdies' after someone replaces a blank in the gun that shoots him for a stunt sequence with a real bullet.
I think Game of Death shouldn't have went ahead with it's release, Bruce Lee would've been disappointed in it as towards the end of the film after fighting Hikim, you could obviously see that it was no longer Bruce playing the part of Billy Lo and it must've been a kid or someone drunk editing that scene showing Bruce with candles and a punch bag behind him and when it cut to his replacement, there was nothing behind him.
This was the film Bruce Lee was working on when he died.
I lived in Reno for 18 years and was there when this movie was filmed.
When he tries to be scary, he's almost funny, and when he tries to be funny, he's just scary.
To me, they just didn't seem scared or freaked out enough in the beginning when bad stuff started to happen.
This is especially evident when the interviewer tries to touch on the subject of David Hess' wife, Karoline Mardeck, also being in the film.
After the David Hess interview, when his wife Karoline is being interviewed by herself, the interviewer tries to again bring up the subject of her being in the film and she just looks away uncomfortably saying "I don't want to talk about it."
It's funny, because David Hess casually and openly discusses his relationship and interaction with the other actors in the film, but when it comes to talking about his wife's role in the film, he understandably becomes guarded.
Mostly terrible acting, cringe-worthy dialogue, completely unimaginative directing, almost no plot to speak of and that final twist I mentioned is so contrived and unlikely you'll want to smash the DVD when it's over with.
I watched this show back when I was in high school and became really drawn to the lives of these women trying to survive.
Reeves and his cohorts expose Lane as a sheepman when the mutt goes to him.
Flynn was looking a mite long in the tooth when he made this oater and the alcohol had robbed him of his spontaneity but not his charm.
A real classic series based on true events,Tenko was a powerful series on the suffering of a group of civilian women during World War 2 when Singapore falls to the Japanese in 1942.
Ann Bell plays Marion Jefferson,the bored army wife,tired of all the endless tea parties and receptions then when she is evacuated with the other women,the first real shock is her best friend Vicky(Wendy Williams)drowning,Tenko certainly got shock you with the death of a popular character when you least expected it.
In the first series we met elderly but defiant Slyvia Ashburton(Renee Asherburn)who refuses initially to sleep beside Eurasian girl Christina Campbell(Emily Bolton) but gradually the woman start to see each other as people and strong friendships are formed particularly when the women build a new hut,much to the surprise of camp commandant Yamauchi(Burt Kwouk) When Cockney prostitute Blanche(one of my favourite characters)is caught escaping with Debbie(Karin Foley)whose mother has just died,the whole camp is punished with a real feud developing between the English and the Dutch,headed by the formidable Sister Ulrica(great performance by Patrica Lawrence)and the selfish Mrs Van Meyer (Elizabeth Chambers) the feud is resolved as the women work towards Blanche's release.
Stephanie Beacham is great as the seemingly selfish Rose Millar with flashes of kindness underneath and her friendship with Blanche is one of the joys of the series,the aborted escape causing a real rift between the two,this is resolved when Blanche is sent back to her friends in the 2nd series after being sent to another camp at the start of series 2 along with Nurse Nellie Keane(who falls in love with Sally(Joanna Hole)in series 1,and Slyvia,Blanche informs them,that Slyvia died a month after arriving in the new camp,Nellie dies a few months before the end of the war in series 3.
Series 2 to me,is the best,we meet evil Miss Hasan,(Josephine Welcome)the evil administrator at their new camp and corrupt leader Verna Johnson(Rosemary Martin)we learn at the end of series2,they both sold their red cross parcels,causing a lot of unnecessary deaths for Doctor Mason(great performance throughout by Stephanie Cole as tortured soul,Dr.Beatrice Mason) Veronica Roberts as Dorothy Bennett excels,she goes from widowed young mother to seeing her baby die,then becomes emotionally dead as she has sex with guards to get by but forms an unlikely friendship with Shinya,a Japanese guard,who has to shot Rose when she meets boyfriend Bernard,Dorothy eventually forgives him only for him to die in an allied raid.
I don't know about other people but when I think of car crashes I think of destruction; I think of death; I think of loss; I think of the time and effort that it'll take to rectify not only the situation involving how the hell you're going to get around now the car's gone but also how you're supposed to recover from the shock of it.
In David Cronenberg's ridiculous attempt at a film, when the character's think of a car crash, they think of sex and then some more sex and then even more sex after that.
Sometimes, hating characters is good and can be done cleverly: disliking an evil character or not liking the ways in which certain characters go about their business can also be good fun but when you see a film that is just a barrage of sex scenes, bizarre characters talking like they're in some sort of drug induced stupor and silly, unbelievable developments; it's very difficult to not only switch your mind off to what's going on but also be tempted to not switch the film off.
In essence, this is what Crash is: it's a portal into the lives of James Ballard (Spader) his close to constantly naked wife Catherine (Kara Unger) who always talks like she's just had a shot of heroin and they're relationship which breaks up a little when James finds time to hang out with a bunch of equally annoying freaks in the form of Vaughn (Koteas), Gabrielle (Arquette) and a few other dregs whose main turn on are car crashes.
It's the scene when James and Vaughn are driving slowly past a crash site as Vaughn takes pictures of various things; getting off over the blood, the death and the way the victims are trapped: the camera shots are close ups of numerous things such as the still bodies, the blood on the door and the way the pliers are applied by the firemen as they crank down and break off the metal framework blocking them from rescuing the victims Â this is not only disturbing in the sense it's supposed to be entertaining but odd that the film-makers assume that we even care about what's going on and think we will like these characters.
Pornography doesn't need to have a plot but when it does, I'm sure it's at a very basic level with minimal character development and talking; again, Crash fits these two descriptions and it's absolutely shocking Â Crash is quite easily a wreck of a 'film' and probably one of the worst I've ever seen.
Displaying penetration where it should not occur and showing what happens when unbalanced people are not brought up correctly.
For example, Ahmet has trouble wielding a Viking broadsword but once he has a curved scimitar made to order he is ready to rock (of course, later, when the band sorties on a mission to attack the cannibals, Ahmet has a Viking broadsword tied to his back and the scimitar is nowhere in sight).
It's unclear why there is any doubt, since the cannibals look like guys with animal headdresses and fall when they are stabbed.
I discovered this series when it played on A&E (back when A&E was actually "artistic" and "entertaining"), but unfortunately, I never saw the first half of the first season.
I was sorry when the series ended and even more sorry that it was never repeated.
I'm sure Rodney Dangerfield was really into that when he was alive.
There's an air of cheapness about the whole thing - the leaders of the experiment literally run the project out of somebody's basement (ridiculous when we learn how high up it goes), and in one hilarious moment, an attempted rapist gets up and walks out of the room after being knocked down by Anna.
Be prepared to feel like bursting out laughing when the really "bad guys" pull some dirty tricks (for the benefit of the creative minds of the authors) with their eyes almost popping out of their orbits.
I was so grateful that someone like Mitchell had made it his work to go around the city at mid-century and actually talk to people whose experiences of New York went as far back as the turn of the century, providing first-hand accounts of life in our fair city when things weren't so shiny and glossy as they are today.
Here, rescue workers scramble to rescue the child using a safety net below, yet the man that is left dangling spends about three minutes complaining that he cannot 'let go' and when he finally does (as a result of getting electrocuted), his lifeless body misses the safety net anyway!
And when the day finally rolls to its end, Hudson and Farrow toast to the past events with a bottle of Champagne!!!
Tumble down it did during a storm when a plane crashes into the top of a mountain.
I absolutely adore Tenko - I saw it on video for the first time when I was 19 years old and was absolutely hooked!
Series 3 took place in Singapore, when the War had ended and the women had to cope with being free, trying to get used to their lives after years of imprisonment.
It's when local high school girl Lucille Dillerton is found drowned and boozed up after she jumped off a pier that the police headed by J.Edger Hoover look-alike Det.
That's exactly what happens when Nick starts to make eyes on pretty and well stacked high school girl Sally Higgins, Teala Loring.
It's when Mimi is brought into police headquarters for questioning that Let.
And you can't beat old Rocky's (Johnny Duncan) logic in trying to convince June (June Carlson) to marry him - Martha Washington was only sixteen when she got married, and she wound up with a president!
However, in an effort to sneak in smut, small studios created films to shock adults when they learn about terrible social ills, though they were REALLY intended to titillate and slip adult themes past the censors!
His great strength in print is his weakness when transmitted to the screen: he conducts painstaking examinations of humanity's inner self, and is a challenge to read.
In other words, as so often happens, the distributors must have decided the flick needed more 'juice,' more 'edge' when no such 'juice' or 'edge' existed.
It is enough to say that when the St. Trinian's films were released as a box set of DVDs this one was not included.
Things go awry when she kills her husband and the daughter flips out and then the story really doesn't know what to do (About 18 minutes into the film).
I saw this film as a student, when it first came out.
It's a mess this film, but more so when you think that a straight musical with the Friml score could have been done and now probably never will and a version with Ty Power as D'Artagnan would have been a classic.
3,50 is not much, especially when it's says: The most funniest comedy since "There's something about Mary" starring: Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Mike Meyers, Alanna Ubach and many others... Alanna Ubach is the hot number from "Meet the Fockers" and Janeane Garofalo (which i personally like as well) known for her work with Ben Stiller on "Reality Bites", "Mystery Men" and lot's of other projects.
Ambiguity is the only possible result when you mix symbolism with an almost complete lack of dialogue.
I guess if the heroine was played by a genuine English actress an American audience wouldn`t be able to relate to her   INTERNATIONAL VELVET is a rather drab movie that`s best viewed on a boring Sunday afternoon which was when I saw it .
She and beau Christopher Plummer are pretty much left behind when trainer Anthony Hopkins comes on the scene.
It calls the organized anti-freetrade mobs that burned and looted "grass roots" - when they are anything but (you don't get 5000 people to spontaneously attack a free trade meeting without some sort of support, logistics, planning, etc).
don't expect a fair fight, but please don't try to laugh when the nazi flags are paraded around and "evidence" shows IBM, the evil corporation, somehow helped kill millions of Jews.
I own this movie and I remember going to see it when it came out.
Perhaps you tried to make it funny but, the only time I was able to smile, was when Lina/LulÃº spots the "Oscar" statue sitting on top of a piece of furniture and decides quickly to put it...to use.
It's about animals on a farm that like to party and goof off when the farmer isn't around.
The farm animals do stuff when the farmer isn't looking.
Can somebody who liked the movie please explain: - Okay so the military drops at least 2 smart bombs when they open one of the silo holes.... but at the end of the movie Dolph and Montel crawl out to greet the press and no visible damage???
- The bad guy is seconds from having his goal of blowing up Washington but for some unknown reason he uncuffs himself from the code suitcase and falls to his death.... thus allowing Dolph time to run to the lab and stop the bomb from exploding... gave me a headache trying to make sense of that - Dolph and one of the bad guys are fighting under one of the missiles when it launches and sprays them with superheated fiery compressed flaming exhaust ..... but Dolph picks himself up and fights on - the bad guy demands the poor President (that guy from Jaws)shoot himself on national TV in the graveyard.... but the gun on the headstone is full of blanks... so why not have a secret service guy bump off the President if it would save the country???
He admitted to things under duress and was never allowed an attorney before questioning, the same way you hear the police on "Law and Order" act like they are angry when a suspect "lawyers up" and act as if it is a bad or wrong thing.
Blackboards is at its best when considered a dreamy, surreal take on real-world issues.
last comment must go to my faithful fellow cinema goers who laughed when the titles came up and someone was credited with writing the script.
What the &*^$ where the people at Cannes thinking when this was given the Jury Award?
If you are thinking of a tough and athletic black man with many gold chains and rings when you hear that, then is the wrong movie for you.
The plot, what there is, concerns the kidnapping of a small child who turns out to be Losee's son (in real life as well), when he's hired to be the ransom driver for the child's family.
I mean, when the first scene of a movie is a sex scene, you know two things.
Naturally, they're spied upon by three horny college guys, and when one of them dies, Detective Lutz and Garner show up to investigate.
Interspersed with this epic quest are flash backs to Liam's youth when he was a pudgy, abused kid who looks abso-tootly-ootly nothing like his older self.
)falls in love with him too and then just when things cannot go on any murkier, he finds his wife who is (another surprise!)
Slow moving (especially when Tommy and Tuppence are on screen), and so lacking in dramatic tension that I am surprised more than a couple of episodes were ever screened.
And when this story is more bore than bore it's not possible to enjoy watching it.
However, when it suits the movie, the same guy is walking around in the alleys of the Bronx.
Only the last 10 (or 5) minutes show a little action when the main character (a peeping Tom who only lives to take photos of other people) kills some bugs with an explosion in his kitchen while he hides in the fridge.
However his picture taking gets him into trouble when he witnesses a drug dealer name Des (Keith Robinson) get killed by someone.
Petty Mimic: Sentinel is the third film in the Mimic series & you know a series is in trouble when they stop numbering them after only the first two & as if by magic my fears are confirmed with this distinctly average at best horror/thriller.
This reaches an unbearable point when he sees the murderer returning home to his apartment, which his girlfriend has just broken into, looking for evidence.
For example when he attempts to report the danger to the police, his mother starts an intimate affair with the officer whom she had met briefly once before several years ago?
None of the characters are in any way sympathetic and it's hard to get worked up enough to care about the film when we don't care about any of the characters.
The film has few redeeming features, but the main one is that it is quite a good laugh to watch with a few mates when drunk, especially at the hilarious musical score and the cheap and nasty production values, (at one point it actually switches from widescreen to normal, then back to widescreen a few minutes later).
Susan Sarandon plays the author's mother who is involved with the sadistic gym teacher (Billy Bob Thorton) the author had when he was a chubby junior high student.
The best we get is when Woodcock said "I'm "Basically" sorry" to the mom but after the entire movie one cant help but feel more mad then amused.
Then when it gets to the end the movie feels as if it just stops.
'Laughed 2 times: when Stifler's buddy got caught on video talking about Sarandon's boobs, and then when that piece of crap Woodcock ate the asphalt.
Susan Sarandon's character supposedly finds this man charming, when in all actuality he doesn't show even an ounce of charm throughout the flick.
The plot has Williams as John Farley (where's CHRIS Farley when we need him?
The plot:  With her family having just brought her a very up-market New York apartment,Vera wants to start a new,by living the high-life.But sadly she is having trouble reaching that level due to her low down "small hustler" boyfriend.Though when her boyfriend says the he wants her to spend some time "entertaining" a big media mogul,who will pay her what ever she wants (but only when it is just him and her alone),and with this Vera starts to plan away the she can con the media guy and her boyfriend in a very big way.
Cagney is a hard-boiled champion Indy driver, who goes a little psycho when his younger brother wants to follow in his footsteps.
You can close your eyes and know when they are having sex scenes - by the classical music crescendo the score rams down your throat every time.
In Neve's defense, she appears to have a better grasp of the depth of her character when discussing it in the interview, but unfortunately, Mr. Toback doesn't bring any character development to the audience.
The sight of Linden's home-assembled car appalls him but when the brood-hen preaches: "Don't ruin your health" the chick usually replies: "I'll show you whether I can drive or not".
When they meet Queen Muset that is when things really go wrong!
I;d had an inkling when those skully horses lept out of the storm cloud!
She shows considerable acting chops here - which is even more impressive when you consider the lack of opportunity for her character to develop.
A man touted as the most important media mogul of Italy offers a hustler $100,000 for an introduction to his girlfriend - and when she says it's not sufficient, goes out and hits banks to score a million in cash for her.
The only honest moment is when he confesses to wanting to get into Neve Campbell's knickers.
This interview takes place as the two are walking along the sidewalks of New York, and when the professor is twice distracted by passers by (one of whom is disgraced boxer Mike Tyson himself in perhaps the high point of the movie) Vera uses each break in their conversation to try to pick up attractive men who happen to be near.
The second (nighttime) sequence is at Legion Ascot, and its 20,000 seats look to be pretty full, which, even when they weren't shooting a feature film, were pretty full even in the nadir of the Great Depression.
i will exercise more caution in the future when it comes to ebert's recommendations.
But when Toback has Neve recognizing a bit actress like Lori Singer on the street like she's Jane Fonda, I wonder what world he's living in.
Then, when the action shifts to the "scheme" in the final twenty minutes, it's good - it's the best part of the film.
But I guess anything goes when you have no material.
It's hard to get excited about a heist when the reasoning behind it is virtually nonexistent.
I guess all shows seem a lot better when you're young.
I was psyched when I saw that "Into the Blue' had been adapted for the small screen, being one of the finest book in a 'trilogy' of sorts.
But, when Jack unexpectedly meets and falls for Jenny Travile (Rachael Leigh Cook), a sexy but seemingly naive jewelry shop clerk, he quickly finds himself trapped in a treacherous love triangle filled with suspicion, vengeance, and murder.
Another fact that annoyed me with "Tempo" was the obvious lack of detail when it came to locations.
They change places when Kim decides to put Dominique into rehab and take her place as a model for a couple of weeks.
What on earth was anyone associated with this project thinking when they made this trash.
And if you watch it when you're happy, you can see that the clichÃ©s were showed for a reason.
Me, I guess I'm not so decent, so I have no shame or reservation when I tell you: your film is mean-spirited and just plain bad.
I don't know why but I came out of the movie blaming him, as if it was he who sought relief of his previous self, when he was a child.
I am a big time fan of Horror movies, i get the thrill and excitement when i watch them.
I can't say much of this movie anymore, when it try to connect past/future in real life and kind of strange connection by dream/reality well, thats where it messed every thing up.
... when the network was carpet-bombing trailers that were possibly the least funny and interesting promos in the history of cinema -- does anyone else think, for instance, that the plummeting of the credibility and popularity of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire dates from Regis Philbin hawking "Bob's book" as having made a huge difference in his life, on the Millionaire set yet, among other network celebrities pretending that Bob Patterson was a genuine motivational speaker?
I saw this movie when I was a child and I love it.
By now you will know that you are not watching a movie, but are instead trapped inside the dream of some pathetic drunken 80s squatters, "a bunch of mindless jerks who'll be the first against the wall when the revolution comes".
Where is "The Day After" when you really need it?
A part that comes to mind is when he asks Kiera Knightly what year it is, she says 2007 and he gives his unbelieving, "wha."
Melodrama, of course, always under girds film noir, but when audiences watch this kind of movie they want to believeÂif only for 90 minutesÂthat the events could really be happening.
Aside from the scene when Shelley robs a bank and forces old ladies to hang on to their car and the subsequent car chase, seeing the old ladies hang for dear life, which I admit was really fun, this film is totally forgettable.
One part during the exorcism, the room is all lit up, when the girl levitates, the room becomes dark [to hide the wires i guess] and when she comes back down, the room is dark again.
I think I only laughed about 2 times; when he kicks a door and it hits back into him, and Russell Gilbert, the cameraman and his crossed eyes.
Priests, demon-possessed nuns, rape, pedophilia - these are the makings of a good horror film when you add demons and the devil.
The lighting isn't even remotely atmospheric, the camera choices are all horrendous (except when they copy friedkins exact camera angles), the acting is soap opera level (at best).
The dialogue is hilarious when the movie builds.
Some good moments when Herc..
Or, the excitement and the adrenaline building up in your body watching Kull clumsily trying to escape from the guards and mouthing the infamous word, "S**t." Needless to say, when any of the characters begins to talk, it kills them right there.
Especially when the wizard shows us the cave full of ancient mummies of dead demons that one imagines are going to come back to life later on.
Just when you think it is headed for a cliche, the film takes a turn and surprises the audience.
The good point is that it's so low budget that takes are not done again when an actor reads his script on paper or when others start to laugh in a crucial moment...
I have no idea why there seems to be a small but enthusiastic following for this film as I only felt relief when it was finally over.
That is, to a time when a snub or a peccadillo had serious social consequences, when an exposed ankle was suggestive and daring, and when the presence of an assertive, sexualized vamp had power to shock us.
Definitely the funniest part of the movie is when the lady says "oh, what the hell" and tries a phone sex job.
Not very smart when the plot devices hinge on the Mitchum / Theiss relationship.
As for Zachary Scott, while he's far from a household name, I loved how slimy he could be--and when I read he was playing a guy who's selling guns to get rich during the Mexican Civil War of the 1910s, it sounded like a role PERFECTLY suited for him.
Seriously, when I first saw the styling of the new baby dragon, I expected it to swallow a turtle any moment on the way and sprout angel wings.
Then there are the brace of peeps that watch this thing for its special effects; trust me when I say that they are quite bad.
It's a case when the term "unnecessary sequel" instantly and unintentionally came to mind without any invitation.
I've seen Dragonheart many, many times (which isn't really a children's movie), but when I saw this one, was surprised to see that's what it is.
And since when did dragons breathe ice?
Yhen, out o nowhere, Drake masters the ability to breath ice and freezes Griffin, who shatters into a million pieces when he drops 30 feet from the air.
But, unfortunately, he should've just settled for 'no,' because when he shows up one night, she bombs out of the building and burns to death.
Nero did not meet Acte when he was young as in the movie but after his marriage with Octavia and his nomination to Emperor.
Perhaps, we are too much attached to great spectacles when we hear of antiquity brought to screen.
According to the movie, Nero, born during the reign of Tiberius, lives for more than 40 years but looks to be in his late twenties when he dies... Continuity combined with made up history is the biggest problem of the movie, which makes it hardly logical, not to say reliable.
Normally, when one critiques a historical movie, it's always fun to point out the inaccuracies that slip in, usually added by the writers to create more "dramatic" situations.
Nero is depicted as an 6-8 year old boy when Caligula has his father killed for treason, exiles his mother Agrippina, and sends the boy to be raised by slaves in the countryside.
Facts: Nero was born about six months after Caligula began his four year reign, and was only three when he was assassinated; Nero's father died of natural causes; Agrippina was briefly exiled for bad behavior, not treason; and Nero was not raised among slaves, but had the typical upbringing of a young member of the imperial family.
Okay, according to the writers, Nero is now about 16 when his great uncle Claudius becomes emperor (in fact he was about to turn 4); Agrippina engineers the downfall of the empress Messalina and marries Claudius, who adopts Nero.
Senatorial opposition to Nero only commenced when he started to show signs of insanity and began killing Senators for real or imagined treason.
They develop a sort of friendship, which is complicated when one of them acts inaproppriately out of his obsession.
They don't actually decide to do anything about it and then seem entirely unsurprised when he shows up again with what appear to be only minor injuries (a bit of a cut on the side of his head).
(Yet again, writer-director -- when are we going to see specialist screenwriters supported in Australia?)
4 stars because its in color I guess, I actually would rather a lame show like friends over this and I always turn the channel when Friends comes on, so there ya go.
It would be one thing if this film were advertised as COMPLETE fiction, but they sell you a bill of goods when they make the claim that it is "based on actual events".
I don't understand this logic; why would one risk their life for low pay in a conflict they didn't believe in for a country they resented, rather than simply take an out when it is offered and go get a job in the civilian world?
Most of all though he seems angry that when the US disbanded the Iraqi army all he was given was fifty US dollars for his years of service.
It is compounded by the fact that it is shot in a documentary style in an attempt to present itself as the truth when it is simply, like any other dramatic film: just one point of view.
But when you do it, do it honestly, or it makes you even bigger liars than those you seek to condemn.
is the question that always comes to mind when watching the Maysles Brothers' astonishing 1975 chronicle.
"Less is more" is an invaluable guideline for actors, but sometimes you just have go a little bit more over the top, even toward the grotesque, when it depicts a character more accurately.
There were several times when I got lost as to whether I was looking at Jessica Lange or the real Big Edie -- the *demeanour*, especially when she was languishing in bed, was so similar.
And, when it ends, the movie actually isn't quite complete.
In all probability, it is an opportunity to put gross special effects on the screen when the Hayes board went away and the MPAA was still trying to figure itself out.
Then, when the gore scenes come, you haven't been engaged by the film in any way.
Malik who saw what was happening sneaks downstairs and takes off with the 10 million in stolen cash but later stupidly hides the money in the fire place having the millions, and the only reason that Beckett & Co. kept his parents alive, go up in smoke.The movie gets really nuts when Rodney's friend and local lawyer Pendelton, Hal Lindan, pops in to check if every things all right.
A movie said to be Irish-English-Swedish was enough to make me watch it when it was on TV, but I must say I'm disappointed.
Why did Danny go all that way and through all that trouble to search for Finbar, when Finbar was a completely selfish prat who no one in their right mind could really care about (let alone the movie audience!)
If theaters gave refunds when people were dissatisfied with a movie, this turkey would have been dropped like a hot potato the third day out.
- Gee, aren't the Japanese quirky and strange - Gee, isn't it difficult when I am in another country and I can't speak the language - Gee, isn't it strange that I feel alienated when I am in another country and make no effort to genuinely appreciate the culture or people - Gee, even shallow people can 'connect' when they meet other shallow people and decide to have a good whinge.
Can I believe this same young woman came to Tokyo with her working husband, yet seems totally at a loss when he actually leaves to work?
This is one of those rare instances when I can only conclude that there is some vast critical conspiracy to hoodwink the American public.
I really had to force myself awake at times when the whole film veered into an extended travelogue or a home movie.
Lost in Translation (er, Sofia) abuse the silence element as the expression of meaning when it really add *nothing* of substance to the aesthetics of the movie, artistic or otherwise.
Sofia is being altruistic to the detriment of the audience when it comes to the vanity of the characters as portrayed Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson which generated zero empathy that makes the movie even less interesting to watch in a continuous manner without becoming fidgety or letting out relaxing yawn.
If you ever made silly home movies with friends on your mom's camera when you were young, it was probably on this level (the only difference being that they had about $50 more to spend than you did).
Mafia hit men fighting the undead is an original idea, but the director who also starred spent too much time trying to make hisself look cool, but that is hard to do when you can't act.
The story for WHISPER: kidnappers get more than what they bargain for when they kidnap a kid with psychic/supernatural powers.
So when the Damien-like child started toying with these criminals, I wasn't terrified or on the edge of my seat.
I couldn't concentrate on anything else other than the white belt when that character was terrorized on the frozen lake.
"Whisper" began on an interesting note, but began to lose it's "spark" about halfway through when it hit me like a ton of bricks that it was simply a compilation of purloined concepts from numerous other horror films - namely "The Omen".
At the start of the movie, the idea seemed good enough, but as it develops, is just a boring story of an evil child that, when kidnapped by a very nice group of people (who just wants to get some desperate money to get a straight life and don't hurt the little child...blah blah), starts practicing his ''art of doom'' with voices inside their heads and a few spooks leading them to get killed.
In the end, when it comes to slasher flicks, while Scream proved imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Camp Slaughter shows that imitation isn't far from ridicule, and this movie can only be summed up with that one word: ridiculous.
May contain spoilers- Starts out very similar to Friday the 13th (flash back to a year when something bad happened at a camp).
So after watching 1 hour of the movie I found out that it would be more fun to eat my own "***".. at least I wouldn't have such an awful aftertaste in my mouth as I had when watching this movie.
One girl stabs another (it's not a spoiler because nobody can possibly care enough about the plot to be disappointed when the predictable happens yet again) and apologizes...but she's kind of laughing when she does it.
The movie seems to take an eternity to pick up the pace and then when things finally kick off, the shocks always feel somewhat half-hearted.
It was quite a shock that she was murdered, especially when every other clichÃ© in the rulebook had been underlined and dotted.
I was somewhat surprised then when I read that a sequel is in the pipeline, which must mean that this wasn't as unsuccessful as many would have you believe.
Sir Sean is aware of being in a bad movie and just has fun with his supervillain part (remember when he used to do so instead of his non-acting nowadays?
At first none of the knights are willing to accept his challenge, but then when the King gets so frustrated at his weak kingdom and offers to accept Sean's deal himself, the brave Miles O'Keefe jumps in and accepts the challenge instead!
That's not a good sign when you're watching a horror/thriller.
this was categorized as a scary movie..........to a 10 yr old he may pee his pants but i don't think it should for the later,this i would say because the ghosts in the movie(a Totally GRUDGE MOVIE RIP-OFF)are shown a lot of times in daytime.......that totally ruins it.....we can clearly see the white powder on the ghosts..............and lot of the movie is 'The Shining' 's RIP-Off.........i don't remember whats scenes are but some like when the kid rides the3 wheeler bicycle and the camera follows him like the same way in the shining......and the background music too was playing same.....DAMN!!!
First i thought 'God, they have copied 'The Shining' because there was this boy who goes about the house in his small cycle and his dad is a writer and then when he starts seeing the ghosts i thought 'Okay its Sixth Sense now' but it was not even so.
Susmita comes to know about the tree through that mad guy (Small funny guy) and when she returns she sees her little boy lying on the floor and now her husband is also a zombie.
The mad guy is very happy to see the tree in ashes and even pees in front of the tree but when he turns back the zombies are not gone.
).Sush wakes up in the hospital and finds her son okay and then when she picks him up the last shot of the scene shows the boy (her son) is also a zombie i.e.
he died when the ghosts smacked him.
Later, Sister-in-law's boyfriend gets killed by ghosts and so is sister, when they are secretly mating in the house.
There is even an insane man (Rajpal Yadav, now when is the last he played a sane character ?)
The biggest suspense in the film is why it is named Vaastu-shastra, which you will not able to crack even when the film is over.
At one place you find some relevance, when you see the name of production company The Factory.
He's blonde, blue eyed and slightly effeminate - so its a riot when he's threatening black drug dealers or knife wielding Mexicans - this is the kind of movie where some of the supposed high schoolers are played by people who look thirty (like the guys in shower who are knifed).
And, when people die, they magically heal themselves and fight on and on and on--all to the delight of a spinning ball of light that looks like it was created by spinning a prism.
Nothing and a grown man trying to get passed off as an adopted son please give me a break wake up and smell the coffee.Is everyone punch drunk?Get the real story thats worth telling.Much was missing from this mans life his mother was the driving force behind him and the only mention she got was did Griffith remember when she died?
And of course, all that follows is from beginning to end is completely standard from the black guy getting killed first to the divergent brothers forced settle their differences when their lives depend on it.
Not when they need it.
Is it called blurbs when referring to films?
An island that has been completely emptied and overthrown by normal looking dogs, but which a few teens (played by adults) can survive on...It's daft, and I bet even the makers realised this when they played back their footage of close ups of cute doggies eyes.
Dogs pop up when you've thought you've escaped.
You know that when they think they've gotten away on a boat left on the Island, that there will be a dog hiding down below in the hold (ending the movie or leaving room for a sequel?
Wondering if the dogs piddled on the script when they marked their territory, because it certainly seems like they did.
Of course, nobody mentions this in 1989 when the movie is seen and scrutinized by millions.
but I am a sensitive person and I cry when I saw "Saving Private Ryan", witch mean: "I don't know what is about but I know something else and I proud about"
I was disappointed by the performance of Malcolm McDowell but on reflection it may be due to the script which seemed to loose direction at the end when Malcolm dominates the screen, and also due to my personal over expectation of Malcolm's return to the big screen.
You know you shouldn't make a sequel when most of your original cast looks like they have been embalmed.
My curiosity kept me watching this movie on the Sundance channel when I happened upon it.
They then attempt to build sympathy with the audience, appearing shocked and indignant first when they ambush him (What?
and again when they get caught and kicked out.
Trying to imply that Moore is just a glory-seeking filmmaker who would rather hobnob with celebrities than join in the protest, the point falls flat when you consider how the now infamous acceptance speech made by Moore (and the film itself) did more for the Anti-war cause than a street protest ever could.
Of course, nobody mentions this in 1989 when the movie is seen and scrutinized by millions.
Anyone expecting something along the lines of the standout far east films such as the Ring, the Eye, the Grudge etc is in for a massive disappointment when viewing this effort.
Whoops I forgot my 3D glasses to experience those mind-popping images (where we are informed when to put them on or take them off), but I doubt that gimmick would have saved this already below-average, if bizarre supernatural/slasher tale from Hong Kong.
It looks like it had a bit money behind it, but it feels second-rate when compared to others of its field and that ending is a complete wimp out.
Before I start this review, I must admit that when I saw this movie, it was the wee hours of the morning and I was slightly intoxicated.
Why should they be mad at men for cheating when they sleep with all sorts of married men themselves?
But when I saw it - and maybe this is me ranting because I, being a white male, am not part of the target audience - I was annoyed by all the whining, especially regarding that the men that these women were sleeping with/getting divorced from were leaving them for white women.
Speaking of Savannah, why is Whitney Houston complaining about finding the right man when she seems to be able to have sexual relations with any man that has matinee idol looks and a job - not to mention is *MARRIED*.
How can this film possibly go anywhere when it's screenwriters has made men so incredibly unredeemable that nothing can change.
But everyone on board apparently missed the memo that... films are better when they have a plot and a purpose.
Then he writes her a letter months later, thanking her for that night and leading the viewer to believe that when his wife kicks off, he'll contact her again.
I don't know about how you would feel, but even to the kid crowd for which this western was clearly intended, when someone shows up with title to those claims it's going to be rather obvious who was behind all the homicides.
This straight to video film when I was young was quite good because it went back to the original style of Scooby-Doo the TV series.
For example, when playing a pick-up softball game back in 1996 Orens stepped to the plate and Baumann yelled from his first base position, "hey, it's King Ralph."
I'll admit, I think I rented it when it came out on video, although I was very young so I will assume my mom rented it for me.
First of all, graphics and music are fine, but unless they're awful, I hardly care about these when I'm playing a game.
Sorry, if you subject the audience to 120 Minutes of nothingness and then pound them with repetitive metaphors, pack all this with the same repetitive music (so what does it mean they listen to the same song throughout the movie when driving in their hummer ... ah, the same as the rest of this repetitive metaphor??)
Another argument, a serious one, occurs when she locks herself in the bathroom for reasons unexplained.
Oh, and speaking of animals, when David has an orgasm he makes more noise than Katia, although, to be sure, both of them overact in these scenes like porno superstars.
The movie drags along for quite a while and when the climax comes we are totally unprepared for it.
If you fly into LAX there are days when you can see the smog as far inland as Twentynine Palms.
Despite the stringing together of numerous interminable takes, nothing of interest happens and the setting is not particularly inspiring, largely because the director doesn't seem to know where or when to shoot his indulgently wasted footage.
But when she saves his life and he responds by assaulting and brutally killing her before killing himself, we are left with even less than we had before, which is a big fat zero.
It doesn't matter, even when you're intending to see the movie.
Or you could listen to the silence when they should talk.
In your mind, you could even speak up for them when they fail.
this film takes an hour and a half for nothing to happen; when it does, it's out of the blue, out of context and out of proportion.
nothing about the characters is explained, no back-story is given, and when the inevitable violence occurs, it's relief to know that these two examples of human excrement will not disgrace our screens further.
This is a story about a young ambitious man who likes being a gangster and when he is young the role is played by Young Gangster, (Paul Bettany).
Contrary to many comments, the dissatisfaction is not about the slow pace Â we still love L'Avventura, Bergman, etc., but when there is nothing to look at in the frame, things become very boring.
I'm still bitter about an incident at the 1982 World Science Fiction Convention in Chicago, when an audience full of idiots (jaded by high-tech S/FX movies) laughed at the cardboard sets in 'The Cabinet of Dr Caligari'.
During one scene, when a swain aims a punch at his rival, the actor cannot simply throw a punch: he must put his fist up against the other man's face, and then shove.
But, when the puppet-master isn't performing, Granach lurches across the screen like Igor the hunchback.
A curator at the Murnau Archiv has told me that 'Shadows' was given intertitles by several exhibitors when it was released outside Germany.
Plus, in the end when you find out who the real murderer is, it really makes no sense at all--nor does his bizarre statue in the basement.
I mean, we're supposed to judge him for having a mistress, but when Madame de cheats on her husband, we're supposed to find it romantic?
It's a lot of movie packed into a bit, which keeps it from getting slow, except when it comes to the violence.
Stalling only seems to occur when the script calls for it.
If you want to see a movie in which the CGI flying sequences are cluttered and unconvincing, where the hero takes no evasive action at all as the nasty guy in the black Fokker sits on his tail taking careful aim, where airplanes continuously fly through the camera, where bullets make holes as big as pie plates when they hit fabric instead of punching though it, where our hero cannot lift the fabric-covered wing off his friend's hand, where a girl learns English in two easy lessons, where the Squadron CO gives the hero a medal for disobeying a direct order, where the hero is out of uniform half the time, and where nobody at all says a damned thing worth listening to, then by all means go see "Flyboys".
Other fingernails on the blackboard include "9mm Spandau" machine guns (they were 7.92 Mauser) and "canvas" covering on the wings when cotton or linen were used because canvas was much too heavy.
As it turns out, the Egyptian's had a secret trans-Atlantic trade route which surprised diggers when a burial tomb was discovered in America.
I admired it, but I felt drained when I left, and I couldn't really say that I enjoyed the experience.
This is also variating and at times you can't even hear some of the characters, while the others are clearly understandable, even when they are in the same scene's at times.
There is a a lot of senseless action in the movie that has no flow, people die needlessly and repeatedly, there is scary music when there is no need for it, importance is placed on certain roles and then they are removed from the movie by being killed off, and the action scenes involving the lead actress is like watching a Barbie doll trying to defend herself.
Especially at the end when she plants the ankh in the neck of the woman!
However, the story is very disappointing, and I particularly liked two scenes: the nudity of the gorgeous and sexy Claudia Lyns, and the funny line of Sheriff Jones, when he says to his skeptical assistant: "- Just because a chicken has wings doesn't mean it can fly."
They acted like powerless zombies when they fought the good guys, but pulled the backbone of some victims in one firm jerk!
This tepid tale begins when a couple of dirt bikers stumble on an ancient Egyptian burial tomb somewhere in the mountains of Los Angeles.
So when they get to the camping site the usual serial killer story unfolds.
Girls fall down when fleeing the killer, stoner guy walks into a freezer with corpses, hunk guy gets mixed up between two girls and Stanley walks around, killing people with his crazy pickaxe catapult, stomping dogs, stabbing people, building funny dwarfs out of corpses and having a relaxing dinner with his dead rotting parents.
A lot of this stuff is absolutely ridiculous, Stanley seems to have supernatural powers when pinning people to trees with pickaxes and making a human shishkebab.
Some party made me laugh and reminded me of the Freddy Krueger Horror-Fun like when stoner guy is killed with a giant spliff and then set aflame.
On learning that his old mentor, Freddie Mays (David Thewlis), has been released from jail, The Gangster (McDowell), now a kingpin among fellow gangsters, moves back to the late sixties when he was a young nameless man (Paul Bettany) just hanging around in the swinging sixties.
Things reach a head when he hits on Karen who rejects him.
The Gangster realizes that Karen and Mays still love each other and his incomprehensible envy towards them has not caused a dent in their affections, and when Mays emerges as the more human person, McDowell sinks in his own self-hatred.
1 is a study not in violence but in self-loathing and what happens when the main character is a black hole.
Supporting cast members include the completely wasted Peter Cook, the annoying Brenda Vacarro, a embarrassed Mia Farrow, as Kara's mother, the very attractive Hart Bochner that was quite good under trying circumstances and Peter O'Toole, who's always fun to watch when he overacts.
There are few moments where Dunaway is really really ridiculous: when she was trying painfully to seduce the muscle-man Etahn; when she was prepare a love-potion with a spider and a hazel's shell but especially in the final when she rolls one's eyes and make terrible smirks and laughs.
This is more than a little vague, especially when Kara makes her voyage to Earth in a spaceship, and emerges in a lake.
Even with this kind of crucial time constraint, she still has time to do a flying ballet when she arrives on Earth (already in costume).
She is an amateur witch named Selena who immediately senses the Omegahedron's power when it literally lands in her soup at a picnic.
It's wrapped in what appears to be a clear plastic tarp that, when punctured, exposes Supergirl to the vacuum of...what?
Don't drop your guard, or you might miss the explanation for his absence, which zooms by when Selena's car radio suddenly comes on.
The Salkind brothers wished to put the series after the failures of Superman III and IV but this in 1984 when he come out was a great box-office flop.
The maid of steal frees oneself from monster's grasp and wraps Selena in a whirlwind pushing her versus the monster: the witch screams desperately when is devoured by the voracious monster.
The all-star cast is interesting; the 18-old year Helen Slater in the title-role is wonderful; she's very beautiful when she flies with the mini-super costume and she gives to character the right mix of naivety and courage; she's the real perfect choice for the role; it is a pity that the picture's failure have run over her and have ruined her carrier still after to start.
In few scenes this enormous ham female falls in ridicule ruinously: when Dunaway prepares the spell-love potion with a spider and a walnut she's really embarrassing or when tries to seduce Etahn painfully or still in the final battle when she screams clumsily before to become feeding for the monster.
If the flippant editing didn't tell us, the bathetic mocking of MacDowell when he leaves to relieve himself suggests that we shouldn't take everything he says too faithfully (or, in his straight-to-camera gesture, that he knows a lot more, eg about these 'friends', than he's letting on - is he a godlike creator?).
It's the small things that gnaw at your cuticles, but when I could tear myself away from the hair, I appreciated the set design, costuming and music.
Fortunately I bought a ticket for this film when it showed in 1988, without knowing anything about it.
This movie became a cult classic in Norway, described as one of the worst Norwegian movies ever made, so when I took the courage to watch it, my expectations where already very low.
When Freddie goes to prison, that's when the young gangster takes his spot in being no.
The maggots reminded me of what happened when Lieutenant Frank Dreben (Naked Gun) had a pillow thrown at his face, except they were serious about it in this movie!
What on earth went through Nicole Heesters mind when she accepted that part, is beyond me.
Did the really think people would like it so much that they'd tell their friends to go see it, and then buy it when released on DVD?
when people forget about Puffy they won't know what the hell this quote means,but if people are smart enough they will let this film and others like it just fade away.
Later when we got out of the theater we all commented that the movie was completely bad and that we should have walked out on it.
His mood changes and he recalls 1968, when he was a young punk (performed by Paul Bettany), and he joined Freddie Mays' gang, his envy of his mob boss and his betrayal.
When i rented the DVD, the story and pictures on the cover seemed fun, but when i got to the middle of the movie i almost fell asleep.
I had to force myself to sit through the entire thing, and was quite proud when I made it to the end.
Even worse, he often stumbles into NYC landscapes that are right out of 80s movies clichÃ©s (trash can fire bums, squatters, s&m, payphones - your movie needs to be updated when it looks like a scene from bonfire of the vanities) This is not NYC, this is NYC circa 1988,  there's so much "ick" factor in this movie, there's even a sex scene with a sleeping grandma in the room.
The one judge x's everybody before they start and then when the other two don't because they want to give the talent at least a chance to perform, he reaches over and x's their buttons for them stopping the talent.
Remember when NBC aired shows like "Hill Street Blues," "Cheers," "St.
And Brandy did the same thing, when the Snow White contestant was stripping on this week's show - she found it offensive and she buzzed in and then proceeded to try desperately to hit Hasselhoff's and the British guy's buzzers, until she finally succeeded.
8/7/08: It was absolutely shameless and cruel last night, the way the judges handled the choosing of the 40 finalists, particularly Hasselhoff, with vocalist Queen Emily - taking advantage of her overly-emotional nature, putting her through the torture of "we don't want to break hearts," blah blah blah, when we all knew damn well she was going through.
Granted, the burlesque dancer should not have through to the top ten on Aug. 2 but when I saw Brandy be so rude to her I got mad.
This show became somewhat absurd when the judges not only venerated the RAPPING GRANNY but voted her into the finals!
They shouldn't pretend to sincerely be about quality when a no-talent "rapping granny" is the judges' choice.
i know they are set up like "token" judges from Idol, the nice one, the straightforward one, and the in-between one, but regardless of who they are, and not to belittle their specialty (acting, music etc) they don't seem unbiased when judging competitors.. it seems 3 real, normal people could do a better job.
The problem is that when it comes down to it it ends up being nothing more than a singing competition with some other performers thrown in for good measure, but without a shot at winning.
At least when watching Hasselhoff a couple of generations will feel some kind of comfort reminding "Knight rider" and "Baywatch".
I enjoy all types of fighting (the real kind) and consequently, I find myself being somewhat critical of film fight scenes, particularly when they involve obvious mismatches.
And how the hell did Brolin get into the mortuary when he carried out his "practical joke"?
And what's with this annoying scene where Arquette JUST HAPPENS to walk into the mortuary at exactly the moment when McGregor is hitting Nolte with a baseball bat and predictably starts thinking her boyfriend is the killer??!
The premise is 5 teenagers go to Ireland to try some magic mushrooms, they pickup the other token spooky Irish guy when they get there.
I try not to be too negative when I comment on films so I shall start with the good points.
A dreadful chiller set in the wilds of the 'Emerald Isle', Shrooms sees a group of teens run into a spot of bother when they experiment with hallucinogenic fungi: as they begin to trip out, they begin to check out.
It got annoying, but eventually evened out when the plot developed.
The music is very good, and it surprised me when I first heard it, and surprised me even more when I saw the composer.
Unfortunately, the disaster becomes a calamity of epic proportions when the music is factored in.
wasn't expecting a massive amount from this movie tbh - in fact i only got it coz i have been reverting back to my childhood days lately and have fancied a bit of horror again (i grew up on horror) and the added mushroom factor only poured fuel on the the fire - horror/scary things in general is last thing u want when ur high on that shat... anyway, turned off lights and got settled, trying to give it a chance..
And when they come across a couple of weirdos armed with guns out hunting, why aren't they just a bit perturbed that their group is alone in the forest with them overnight?
Even when I had considered my verdict, these factors were almost enough to make me think otherwise.
The main character's visions were never inaccurate to what would happen, nor were they ever vague, so when the given character would die, you had already seen it happen.
They don't need an interesting plot when you can just bash together some loud noises to try and scare the audience every two minutes.
No one complained when there were extreme freak rednecks in the likes of Texas chainsaw Massacre or Wrong Turn and considering I believe there are people in this country who still believe in "the banshee", fairy rings and other such insane Carroll's Irish Gift Store endorsed ideas, that it is entirely appropriate to enhance this image into that of the drooling country freak.
They're obviously spoiled brats because the only thing on their mind when they're in freakin' IRELAND is getting their hands on some magic mushrooms ASAP.
I am however a fan of cinema and horror movies and take offense when a 'popular' director picks a 'popular' genre and makes a total pigs ear out of it, when I then in turn am expected to shell out premium prices for someone else's vanity and back-clapping.
But it just rides that horse too long and too slow... so when you get the ends twist you already might be too sleepy to care.
Wwhile I'm on the subject of music...it was there when it shouldn't have been and STOPPED the moment it needed to be there.. music while talking and none during 'action'.
I absolutely despise when somebody reviews a movie that they did not even watch through, but *I* could not finish this movie.. for only the third time ever ( the first, being the pitiful remake of Rollerball, and second being that miserable piece of rancid feces, Freddy Got Fingered).
Heck, even other indie filmmakers have the intellect to know when they are making an unwatchable scene.
I can't do it when you watch me!".
You just know a movie is going to blow when 50% of the opening credits go to special FX techs, the dude who cast "extras" for zombies, and the writer/director/editor is credited with about a half of a dozen other billets.
Since childhood I've found the actors playing the bad guys more interesting than the main characters,at least till about 1970 or so.Many that I viewed in the 1950's didn't last long in a movie or TV program because they were an early victim to the star.Some eventually went on to make names for their selves but for the most part I liked them more when playing minor roles.Some of those minor role villains are in this movie and I found them very entertaining.There's Neville Brand playing King Fisher,a good performer but sometimes a little bit to scary even for me when dealing out punishment.Others like Faro (Lee Van Cleef),Sundown Whipple(John Doucette) and Blackburn(Claude Akins) are in top menacing form.While not a household name another quality performer is Robert Middleton playing Ben Ryerson.Whether playing a politician or a mob boss he gives a quality performance.In this movie he's a bit grubby looking but handy with both a gun and a knife.Then there's Willie (Elisha Cook Jr) one of Fisher's men.He usually bursts into a room big eyed bearing news but has to grab a quick drink before speaking.So much to my delight the cast includes a rouge's gallery of personal favorites,almost like a dream come true.For those who like the good guys the movie leans more towards a nightmare.Jack Palance plays Jacob Wade the main character.As usual he has the look of a strong tough looking man.His performance is better than usual but that just means it's not as stiff as usual.The story lacks a bit of direction also.Those two points are forgotten because of Anthony Perkins who plays Jacob Wade's son Riley.His part lacks direction or maybe a director as it seems like he or someone else wants to sabotage this movie.First off he's too old and big to be playing the part of the son.When he does show some sign of a emotion it's fitting more for someone at least 10 years younger than him.To the simple statement that his mother(deceased) was a fine woman he responds blandly"talk about my mother again and I'll kill you",really off the wall.Elaine Aiken gives a good performance and is nice looking.In another comment it was basically said her character with it's good qualities has no reason to be interested romantically in the wimpy Perkins character,that's hitting the nail on the head.So this movie was just about what I expected,the minor roles out shining the main characters.One of the main characters looked like a good friend must of gave them the part.
There are few genuine scares, yet the film generates some definite frissons along the way: Lockwood, a mediocre pianist at best, suddenly playing a piece faultlessly in front of guests; the girl's spontaneous quotation from a poem she readily admits to being unfamiliar with; and, especially, her close encounter with an unseen entity (woken up by the piano mysteriously playing at night, we hear its lid being violently shut when she enters the room, followed by the camera's swift panning Â suggesting something had gone past her Â and then hushed voices plotting murder in the hallway).
Naturally the reason it's been empty for so long is because everyone has heard the tale about the ghost that haunts it......many years ago a young girl lived there, with just 2 servants to look after her after her parents died, and when the girl too died, the servants (a married couple) were bequeathed her fortune; as was her wish for their kindness.
But when a young girl (Margaret Lockwood) comes to live with the Smedhurst couple as companion for the wife, the soul of the dead girl takes over her mind, leading her to madness and near certain death.
The only drawback, if you can really call it that, was the distraction of James Mason made up to be a man much older than his original years when he made this.
I remember watching this Program when I was in Military Service in West Germany.
I did not like it when it was cut off.
We were, as a family, very disappointed when this show was canceled.
I'll admit that when I first turned on ABC family at 8 I was a bit skeptical about this movie.
I even recorded it so we could watch it when its not on TV!
It just shows that you should not judge people by who they were when they were younger but who they are now.
The movie suffered a little bit from the script, but then again I tend to be picky when it comes to delivery, so this might just be personal bias.
There was definitely a lot of "clever" put into the writing as well, such as when Gabby and Mel's plot from preparation to fruition.
Not being noticed when we are young, and then blossoming and getting the guys attention later on.
Since I was not at my own home when this started, I didn't change the channel.
After that show ended, I was sad when she seemed to vanish.
to make the most of it, meaning that when that show was *finally* put out of its misery, he still had good chances at finding a new job.
But... Rue (who is really beautiful when her face lightens up the screen) surprised us with her talent.
Who could believe that the `Dunn and Cropper' radio talk show could possibly exist when they both seemed to be reading off of cue cards the entire movie?
I'm a huge fan of romantic comedies and when I saw this movie on family channel I instantly loved it.This is not your average romance story but it's filled with humor , love and revenge.
The situation is further complicated when Mel actually falls in love with him.This film totally rocks and in my book it's an adorable romantic comedy 8/10
There are some occasions when Messrs Norman Lee, Ernest Palmer and Charles Gilbert manage to overcome an obviously limited budget to produce a few genuine thrills and atmospheric effects.
As the movie starts he's handing in his resignation from Scotland Yard when June walks in to the office to report a murder.
A woman in need of help and rescue as many others plot against her and try and steal her key to the "door with the seven locks", the seven keys to which when combined will open Lord Selford's tomb containing his family jewels.
A young woman tries to solve this mystery and all is revealed towards the end when the door is opened... Includes a mute butler and a mad doctor who collects items used for torture.
Taken as a period piece when the sexual revolution was completely redefining the country's moral code, the film is a shrewdly observed, sharply comic character study among the Southern California bourgeoisie.
They really think that when later Carol suddenly announces that Bob had a brief affair with another woman and they're both happy with it.
Robert Culp and Natalie Wood play a VERY liberated couple who basically love each other...when they cheat on the other they discuss it and talk out their feelings and end up still madly in love.
I had seen this movie on television sometime in the middle '70s, when I was in my twenties and had a special fondness for Natalie Wood.
I was surprised to see this movie on DVD when I was in the store a few days ago, but I didn't see anything else that I really wanted to watch, and was naturally curious about it, so I rented it.
The late sixties were a unique period in the twentieth century, when for a short period of a few years, throughout western culture, people were testing the limits of traditional sexual taboos.
Anyone who looks at these two movies side-by-side will surely agree that "Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice", while moderately amusing when it was current, has no lasting value.
Things begin to heat up (in a good way), when Bob has an affair with a woman, and Carol becomes OK with it, and hence the 2 of them openly accept that having having sex with another person is OK, as there are no emotions involved.
Dyan Cannon creates some magic with her bitchy, uptight Alice: memorable, seemingly improvised therapy scenes where the character's awkward communication skills are highlighted ring very true-as does her frustration near the end when she tries to initiate the orgy.
The pay-off, it seems to me, is in the fact that at the moment when the enthusiastic couple and the reluctant couple submit to the full and unfettered concept of free love, they finally realize the truth that no matter how much love and social freedom they feel towards their dearest friends, there are still some areas of human experience that are best kept private and intimate.
His juvenile outburst is hilarious, but when the two men meet and share a drink, it's Mazursky who brings the viewer back to Earth with a bit of poignancy.
Elliott Gould was never more befuddled, Dyan Cannon's best acting when she was gorgeous, Robert Culp's only decent movie, and Natalie Wood was born to play Carol.
Hung and Ann(Pauline Chan and Rena Murakami)are down-on-their luck prostitutes trapped in Hong Kong.Pauline's boyfriend,Sam back in China,who is under the impression that she is away working at a factory,is double-crossed by Billy Chow,and while looking to escape;flees for Hong Kong and winds up at the brothel where Pauline is employed.He is crushed when he finds out the truth..."Escape from the Brothel" combines plenty of gory fighting,romance,sleaze including several violent and unpleasant rape scenes and comedy,all into one.There is plenty of full-frontal female nudity and I'm not complaining about that.The violence is rather brief until the full-blooded finale,although one scene where a woman is strung up and has her nipples wired to a portable electric generator is strong stuff even for Cat III sleaze.A must-see for die-hard fans of smut!
Thought not as high on the "sleaze-scale" as notorious CATIII "classics" THE UNTOLD STORY, RED TO KILL, or THE EBOLA SYNDROME - ESCAPE FROM BROTHEL sure tries hard to wallow in it's rating, and does a damn good job...  Two parallel story lines collide when a guy living on the Chinese mainland is called over to Hong Kong to pull a job with a few buddies to rob a jewelry store for the store-owner's boss to get the insurance money.
The jewelry store job goes wrong when one of the robbers shoots an interfering tourist - and are then double-crossed by the jewelry store owner.
Almodovar is a master story writer--he knows exactly what to tell the viewer and when to tell it.
He's not an expert when it comes to casual sex, but she wants to see this woman again, and doesn't understand why she acts like she didn't care what happened.
Liberto Rabal doesn't show much acting talent, he's not the mos experienced in the cast, but somehow, when he talks, he seems not right, but perfect, for his role.
She does not remember him, so when he shows up at her house she takes a gun and forces him out of the place.
He was 12 years old when Pino had already released his masterpiece The Hour of the Furnaces.
How come you demand a little bit of humor when we are talking about the lives of millions of people that were ruined?
As of Spring 2004 when I was in Buenos Aires and watched the movie in theaters, many older couples were yelling at the political figures speaking in the movie.
I think when one looks at these films ... really looks at them ... one can see why there had to be a feminist movement.
Gidget's mother reassuringly stands by and tells her everything is AOK and she will know that man when she meets him.
For a moment, though, when I watch it, I step away from the sadness and vicissitudes of life as it is.
I have loved this movie ever since the first time I saw it years ago when I was a preteen.
I remember when I first received that movie.
For example when Kim Novak was preparing dinner and she had salad and lemonade all sitting there before her family was home.
It takes me to the time when life was innocent and we could use the word 'gay' to mean happy.
Dee is spunky teen (only 15 when this was filmed!)
It's priceless when Gidget gets one of the surf boys, Hot Shot, to help her make Moondoggie jealous, and Hot Shot backs out of their deal, and Moondoggie steps up to the plate, completely unaware that he was the intended target.
Here's a prayer that Sandra Dee's other great teen movie classic from 1959, "A Summer Place" (through Warner Brothers) due for a DVD release in a few days as of this writing, will be restored to widescreen, recapturing its theatrical glory that enchanted and captivated moviegoers way back when.
Gidget was a movie I saw when I was just going into high school.
Including when Gidget meets James Darren and he is so very dreamy.
The story is not too complicated, girl likes boy, girl chases boy who is a surfer, girl learns to surf and tries to make boy jealous, boy pretends he is not interested, then comes unglued when she is with someone else.
This is a movie close to my heart as this was one of the movies I used to watch when I used to go to my Grandma's house.
Years later they meet when they give blood to their real mother (they don't know that yet).
This was a huge hit when released and it my opinion remains of Manmohan Desai's best films.
The movie begins when Kishenlal (Pran), a taxi driver for the gangster Robert (Jeevan) returns to his wife Bharati (Nirupa Roy) and sons after spending many years in prison because of a crime committed by Robert.
Amar, Akbar and Anthony are all brothers separated when they are very young.
There are places when he becomes the Angry Young Man he is famous for - but his comedy scenes are what set him apart in this movie.
Years later, when they've grown up, the three of them meet again donating blood to save the life of the woman they don't know is their mother.
Rod Serling's Night Gallery is a throwback to the good old days of horror movies when good writing was more important than senseless violence or gore.
This tv-movie is difficult to purchase and is not aired often so make sure you see it when it comes on.
"What's it going to be like when it's midnight all the time and nobody's paid the electric bill?"
In the second segment, Joan Crawford plays a blind woman who receives her sight back briefly when she pays a debtor to donate his eyes to her.
I was there when Night Gallery first appeared, in my early teens.
Although, when the series started, Serling wasn't given the kind of creative control he felt he needed to make the series work (and not surprisingly, it was mercilessly compared to "The Twilight Zone"), on this pilot film, he was firmly in control.
Having always been a fan of both, I may be a bit biased, but most fans will agree with me that the two play wonderful villains, yet evoke a certain pity when they get theirs.
The plotlines follow the model of the 1950s horror pulp comics, with characters spoiling for their comeuppance: a black-sheep nephew suffers a revenge beyond the grave after murdering his rich uncle; a ruthless blind woman blackmails a surgeon into performing a transplant using the eyes of a desperate bum; a war criminal finds what he thinks is respite from his pursuers when he is miraculously transported into a museum painting.
Roddy is snide and sly as the nephew, and when he starts to come unhinged he's marvelous.
It's a relief to be hounded no longer by the war crimes police when he's in the painting.
She has the operation, and when the time comes to take the bandages off, the instant she does the city is plunged into a blackout.
She spends the 8 hours trying to get out of the apartment building in the dark stairwells, and finally makes it back to her apartment when the sun comes up.
The movie was slow early on but when it finally got going it led to an exciting climax.
It's all good entertainment, if you look the other way when the pontificating is going on.
But when that "spirit" takes human form and joins the local police force, really it's too much!
The film often looks as though it is about to veer off into porno territory which is no surprise when you look up the Directors former and subsequent credits.
Yes, CARNIVAL OF BLOOD doesn't make any entire bit of sense, especially when it is a B-movie, and if you get a desperate chance to view it, be sure to invite some friends or members of your family to gather 'round for an evening of pure ill-minded entertainment.
I'll leave the actual plot for you to work out when you see this.
That's a big handicap when most of the movie was shot at night on the noisy Coney Island boardwalk and Astroland.
In fact, one of my favorite exchanges was when after Funt asked what a premature baby was, this boy said, "It's one who knows a lot for his age."
I also loved seeing that scene with that red-haired woman when she faked an orgasm after getting spray-painted!
The passing years have only added to the film's value, for it turns out to be a revealing portrait of changing attitudes to sex in the late sixties, when people of all ages with open minds were receptive to new ways of thinking about sex.
when it's actually, "Charlie, how'd you get caught with that one?"
(I remember, for example, a theatrical short where Funt, as a travel agent, insisted, with total courtesy and friendliness, on selling a customer a fancy vacation when they wanted something plain and simple.)
If you're like me and drool like an over-hormonal teenager when that unlikely sex-symbol James Nesbitt smiles his cheeky-charming smile then you MUST go and see this film.
I had avoided this film for some reason - maybe it was the plot details, but when I viewed it I was pleasantly surprised.
So when I was dragged into the cinema to see this follow-up by the same director, I went kicking and screaming.
Just what is needed when stuck in lousy winter weather.
I gave it try when I first watched it.
I was a fan of anime and I thought since when did this start being animated by the Japanese?
Before you can say Gene Autry, Powell is promoted into America's favorite singing cowboy--though he's hard pressed to prove his western skills when the plot situations demand it.
Also great for women who would like insight into the dumb things guys do and talk about when they get together with nothing but time on their hands; great times and lots of laughs.
So watch the movie for the interplay going on and the well written story about waiting for the right one to have sex with first, and when you hold off, the complications that arise in the male partner.
It is entertaining and not predictable at first, but when you find out what is actually going on it does get a little silly.
I would give it a shot for sure, when you think you're in the mood for it of course (:
The frat-house shenanigans are tame beyond belief when compared to other Lampoon college movies, and the girl waiting for the perfect time to toss in her V-card is an old theme that isn't freshened in any way by this film.
I admit when it comes to watching straight to video National Lampoon movies nowadays, it's expected to be something zany for the average couch stoner to watch on a Saturday when there's nothing else to do.
I guarantee there will be a lot of horndogs hoping for boobies and hi-jinx to grab it from the shelves, only to be disappointed when nothing funny or exciting happens well into the film.
Especially when in an earlier episode, at his funeral, the same boy ghost shows up all happy, and at peace.
I'm not one to watch much TV, but when I catch one or two episodes of a show worthy of my time - I'll wait for it to come out on DVD so I can catch the entire series without interruption and in proper sequence.
Gross and Disgusting images, the most sickening is the brutal killing of Brolly when he was a baby.
Goku's famous move, the Kamehameha, doesn't even faze Brolly and even when Piccolo, Gohan, and Trunks give their energy to Goku, he can't even scratch Brolly.
Paragus is a suave villain and it's a bummer when he dies.
It's slow upfront but when the first person ('Franky', Frances) dies of starvation because the girl is on an extreme diet, the movie gets intense.
Broly himself is an amazing character, as he does a good job pretending to be good then losing it when Kakarot aka Goku shows up.
But when she looks into his background, she finds that what she knew about him turns out to be false, and he may have been involved in criminal activity.
And I do not understand it in the slightest when people say she stole the film from Thora Birch.
Things start going badly for Adrienne when a curator is mysteriously found dead at a museum, and it is revealed that a piece Jack bought for the museum for millions of dollars is a fake.
I first saw this film when my children were so small that they consumed my time and energy and things went in one head and out the other.
Possibly the best scene in this movie was when she *possible spoiler* confronted her husband's pregnant new "wife".
I started the movie and when i finished i was in love with it.
The animation in Macross: DYRL is great, especially when you consider that this was made in 1984!
Okay, I was a little confused when I finally saw the American adaptation of the Macross TV series, but what the heck....
I was even luckier when I discovered a subtitled VHS copy of it, and it has since become one of my favourite animated movies of all-time.
This movie must have taken at least a few people's breaths away when it was initially screened in 1984, because, even when you compare it to Japanese animation of the time (including Hayao Miyazaki's much-lauded feature debut Nausicaa), the level of detail and movement on display is mind-boggling.
But I like to think that I know good film-making when I see it, and Do You Remember Love certainly is that.
The only entertainment value to be found as Varney mugs endlessly and destroys everything around him is in the hopelessly slack direction, which leads to such lapses in logic as a cannon rolling for miles along a completely straight road, a sequence that is topped only when the cannon bursts into a garden but leaves the fence behind it completely intact.
The plot was turning in many interesting directions making it impossible to figure out the ending (films can get old when producers make movies with the same old plots over and over again).
Due to that I did not have any high expectations it is true that this movie tries a little too hard to become a cult classic and that some jokes do not really work out (as the phone ringing a couple of times when the hit-man is just about to kill some fellow) but on the other hand there are some brilliant scenes.
It may not be perfect, but after all I always like to watch the film when it's shown in TV every few years.
Seen when it premiered in Germany in November of '98, I accompanied all the avant premiere buzz surrounding the film and Schweiger's career moves, and even attended one of the premieres Schweiger hosted at the new Potsdamer Platz Cinemaxx.
If you are a Schweiger fan or a an action drama lover, don't miss DER EISBAER when it comes out on video or if it opens outside Europe.
Wing Commander was one of the first real interactive movies when the third installment was released in 94, it pushed the boundaries for graphics, acting and storyline into uncharted heights for a video game.
I was excited when I heard this movie was coming out, because I am a fan of the games.
However things don't go according to plan as when they try to leave the bunker they discover the hatch is locked tight.
It moves along at a nice pace, it has some nice twists & turns while it's one of those films which really comes together during the final 10 minutes when the truth is finally revealed, it may not come as the biggest shock in the cinematic world but it's effective, satisfying, you'll be thinking about it whether you liked it or not & it ties up everything that has gone before really well.
I had been a big fan of the video games when I was younger, and considering how good Wing Commander 3 had been, you could only expect that the movie would be decent.
And it moves at such a pace that it is impossible to be bored unlike Star Wars Episode 1 where I sat through that entire pod race scene wondering when it was going to end.
First of all, I avoided this movie when it was first released because of the bad reviews.
I say "objective" simply because I have never been exposed to the hugely popular game series, so I was seeing this as a film, not as a spin off (in which case I'm sure it would come across worse, simply because when you're used to one set of actors portraying your favourite characters a new team will never fit the bill).
It basically consists of the team stopping the Kilrathi from snatching a "Nav-Com" unit that will enable them to target destinations when jumping through wormholes, and thus enable them to hitch a ride to Earth.
You can bet that many members of the support cast neglect to mention this effort when discussing their CVs.
Incidentally, since when do you cast an actor with a French accent as thick as pea soup to play a character who was known in the early video games for having a Scottish accent so broad that it cemented the games reputation as a collection of stereotypes.
The spacecraft design leads me to believe that members of the crew might be at least half right when they say that the problem with this film is the budget.
In a time when science-fiction theatre was costing upwards of a hundred million per film, a miniscule thirty million was spent on this production.
Shots of the main enemy in anything other than spacecraft form are rare, and when we do finally get to see the Kilrathi, they look more like big turds than humanoid cats.
The Rashomon type plot is a little too simple, we know that the other three are dead and we also know that when four people go somewhere enclosed and one comes out alive, that they had something to do with it.
He insists that "Wing Commander" is the worst movie ever made, so when I saw that SciFi Channel was going to air it this week, I thought, "Oh, good!
The hero's annoying best friend and his sort-of-girlfriend have disobeyed the leader of their team and, thanks to Cosmic Revenge, the sort-of-girlfriend dies when she crashes her little spaceship into the landing pad thing on the big ship.
My second favorite part is when we finally see the Kilrathi for the first time.
As for the green fog, that's to remind all the Kilrathi of the awful stench their ancestors had to suffer when their litter was left unchanged.
But I know a horrible movie when I see one, and this movie is pretty much unwatchable whether you've played the games or not.
The effects were incredible, especially when you consider the (relatively) meager budget the film was done on.
Too often, when their political toadying days wind down, they join important New York law firms or become Washington "consultants," toadying in only a slightly different milieu, and able now to directly afford their bespoke suits and strip steak dinners at The Capital Grille.
He was attracted, while at university, to the shy Agnes, but when warned off by her family's boarder one evening, he hurriedly left her home.
Then he must manage his family's factory when his father dies, lording it over the workers and nuzzling the town's leaders.
While in "Der Blaue Engel", the protagonist is a person who cannot adapt to the world around him, and when he tries, shamefully stumbles and at the end pays his attempts with his life, the main figure in "Der Untertan" is so-to-say the complimentary character: Although born in an aristocratic, high-class family, surrounded by the world-literature and regular house-concerts and thus widely detached from bourgeoisie, he finds out that he may make carrier by breaking out of this status-group isolation in trying to meddle with politics.
The height of his career is the opening of a warrior monument in Netzig; he appears as the official speaker and baths in the patriotic phrases of national authorities when a thunderstorm interrupts the ceremony and clears the whole place.
I was over at the local used book/CD/movie store the other day when my friend came up to me showing me this movie for sale for $2.50.
A group of film makers are struggling with production, when one of the kids (I mean "kids" literally, because these actors look as if they were only 17 or 18-years-old.
Well, the director of the films sees the ghost, and immediately after he wakes up, begins to construct a bunch of things that resemble what he saw when the spirit came into his room.
They sneak into the closed set, end up in the basement of the house and are about to break into a wall, when the ghost of the great grandfather shows up, inhibits a suit of armor, and begins battling the kids.
I wanted him to stay dead, and when I saw him driving that limo, I wanted to punch a hole through a wall.
Marian lives only for her children, and when Cliff tries to talk to her about his loneliness and hurt at always taking second place to the kids, she makes light of his feelings with some condescending and witless comments that made me want to choke her.
Watch this movie when you get a chance, but try to picture somebody else in the Joan Bennett role.
So when old friend Babs shows up, he spends time with her, only to fall in too deep.
Virtually unknown among Sirk's catalog, which is reasonably when you consider his classic films like 'All That Heaven Allows' and 'Imitation of Life.'
McMurray is a toy manufacturer and Sirk gets lots of mileage out of the metaphor; McMurray toys with the idea of leaving wife and family, as does the 'other woman', Norma Vale (Barbara Stanwyck), who turns up out of the blue and past respectively just when McMurray is at his most vulnerable yet ultimately Norma merely toys with his feelings.
Movie fans will recall the aforementioned movies when the topic of Sirk's movies arises.
What we are shown is a man who when young, courted the prettiest girl, married, had children and worked hard to build up a successful business.
I consider myself a cinephil; not a cinema freak but at least a person who does not sleep when watching movies other than Hollywood bang-gang-do-sex things; I am outrageous (!!!)
A wonderful music track when the noise is not happening.
I was overwhelmed with excitement when Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind came back into print on DVD this year.
It's great to see REAL actors displaying their craft in a time period when talent was more important than looks, bra size and CGI.
It is when Rory suffers a near-fatal heart attack that the film really gets it's biggest interest (although there are moments of good chat before), and all characters are brought together to rediscover themselves.
Geez,this is as bad as Woody Allen when he decided to "go serious" and make Bergman movies,but without any of the feeling or the skill.
The theme is reiterated and simplified when Phil states to himself, "Life is too short".
The characters in Sweet Sixteen had so much more fire inside that it made you root for them, even when they made the wrong choices.
To me some of the dialog is just like taken out of my family conversation when I was a kid.
There is a scene when Spall repays his wife some money he has borrowed from her that just perfectly encapsulates the pain at the heart of their relationship.
And just when it seems that life sucks bad forever, everyone realizes who they love and what they live for when they almost lose one of their own.
It's true that it is a rather depressing movie, at first sight, when you don't look closer and don't get involved in the story.
All or Nothing reminds me of life on a council estate as I remember it when I was a kid.
The acting is up to scratch and especially moments when the captives are in the prison and they really are feeling the pain and torture and still managing to resist the urge to stop it.
I think I started to watch the show when I was 11 or 12 years old (I am now 15).
Still it brings up happy memories when I see an episode once in a while.
My favorite moments were the first four years when Brenda and Dylan were the couple!
This is mainly because our author lived in the days when men wrote about other men as adventurers, and left all the romantic stuff to women authors!So there is room for a little poetic license, or the film would be made exactly like the original!
OK now that the same drugs that apparently the director was on when he produced this 'stinky fish' have worn off all I can say is: "How can a good cook take such excellent ingredients for making a fine dish (film) and combine them so badly??"
All his scenes were in a studio or against a 'Blue' screen, even when appearing to be in scenes with other actors - probably the best Special Effect in this film.
First I read the book "The Mysterious Island" when I was very little and it gave me wonderful time of dreams and adventures.
Lots of the scenes and special effects makes me wonder how is it possible this movie to be made in 2005 when they're so ridiculous and cheap.
I watched about 45 minutes of a 2 part movie?...and it was obvious that when they shot it the story was in flux.
I just couldn't stand more than I saw when the "pirates of the pop-scene" came aboard so malevolently.
There's a scene when he's dining with Nemo, in which there's a giant crab pincer served as main dish, and he seems completely oblivious to it.
Only when Nemo warns him that the island is dangerous due to giant creatures, does he react with surprise and disbelief... well what's that in front of your face then you dummy???
I was looking forward to watch this film when I knew the local TV station was going to air it because I liked the book.
Then I was a bit confused when the 'mother and daughter' tagged along and Gideon and Herbert were nowhere to be seen.
Then I couldn't stand it anymore when Pencroft and LeMay ( <--who is this?? )
First of all, not only do our heroes react with hostility and violence when they finally encounter other normal human beings of the non-gigantic-man-eating-insect variety on the island, but after inviting them over to their humble Robinson Crusoe home, complete with dinner table, place settings for ten, goblets, eating utensils, candles, and the like, but once convinced of the defected pirates' trustworthiness, they give one of them - a caveman looking sort from years surviving on the island Â a total celebrity makeover, shave, haircut, gel, new clothes, etc.
The worst thing that the movie does, besides the deplorable performances and ridiculous screenplay (I can even forgive awful direction as long as the effort is there), is that it tries to create dramatic and intense situations when there is no reason for it.
f) Liz is so convincing when she talks, that everybody instantly believes her: see the ending.
g) Think about this: when Liz came out, the door was OPEN.
It might be good when edited to a 90 minute special.
And the only thing I love more than Mulder beating the crap out of Chesty Short is Scully's amusement when told.
Dismissed as another episode, Mulder and Scully ultimately return to D.C with nothing when Billy is taken by the Bounty Hunter, who had finally convinced him that he was who he said he was.
As a result, we have what I reckon is one of the best X Files moments ever, when a hesitant Skinner leads Krycek and Marita into Mulder's office.
In previous episodes, when UFOs are involved, watches stop, not spin backwards, indicating a loss of time.
I like Scully's smile when Mulder mentions assaulting the auditor.
Another inconsistency is when it shows the Cigarette Smoking Man(CSM) dying.
A question I have is when he impersonates the personalities of the people, like Det.
I find it inconsistent how he acts when impersonating other people.
The wiggling effect is cool when Gary and Scully encounter the UFO.
It especially hit when they began talking about having seen the toxic blood before as if it were old news and Scully explains it to Billy.
I love that scene when Mulder, Skinner and these two are in Mulder's office and he tries to attack Krycek and then they are standing around talking when Scully walks in.
There's also a joke where two characters are discussing the robbery they're going to pull when one exclaims " Let's get out of here , it's like a public park " The camera then pulls away to indeed show the conversation was taking place in a public park .
It seems to me that, when contemporary filmmakers try to present an "honest" depiction of the Glaswegian he tends to go for the "gritty realism" of the drunk or the druggie or the wife beating hard-man!
The twist of the stories are very well done, you really can open your mouth really wide when you see the ending of the episode.
I cannot say less, at the beginning I didn't want to watch it, I thought: "another mix of gore and mystery with nothing good to make you think" (something like millennium) But finally I found at least three good reasons because the Collector it's one of the best shows 1- Unpredictable: from the first episode you'll never know when there's a "happy ending", the stories are very dark but there's no use of unnecessary violence, everything has a reason.
3- Epic: "the collector" talks about the inner war, I mean: the battle between light and darkness of every human being, for their own private desires, the price to make the dreams come true specially when we destroy the life of other people.
I saw the movie once (when originally aired).
I don't know how my dad bought it but it must have been popular in the states when I was young.
i saw this movie on October 28 of 2005 and i have to  say that its a very great movie because it was 10   years older and its most impressive than others "when i saw this movie i think was real because  was SO real that i have change the channel to CNN  and other news ,i want to buy this movie or recorder  from TV but i cant but unless a question a have only say that this is that type of movies that you  need to see because the simplicity is the best  this is a drama movie but i have to say that this  movie scared me a lot more than other how scream or that type of movies
Giving me the creeps and chills every now and then when i go to bed (it just wont go off).
And didn't I cop it when I finally got to see that it wasn't even being broadcast on CNN or BBC.
I have to wonder if Jimmy was wanting for cash when he said yes to this flop.
I was thirteen when I saw this film.
This like it's going to be a good slasher at the beginning, when in the second scene, Bigman defeats another bikie in a jousting match with chains, then soon after another of his gang punches a nun to death, but it goes very quiet after that and never picks up.
But have they met their match when they try to take over a farm presided over by a resourceful farmer and his feisty family?
From a purely artistic point of view I've seen much worse even in the last month, but why waste time on this when there are so many other superior movies out there calling for your attention?
The Faber's peaceful existence gets jeopardized when a vicious horde of scummy, black leather-clad cannibalistic bikers led by the highly intimidating and intelligent Bigman (coolly underplayed by big, brawny, hirsute George Eastman lookalike Ian Steadman) stop by and lay siege to their house.
To prostitute yourselves is "just like any other thing" (that's what they say when they want to justify what cannot be justified, when they want to humanize the subhuman, to dignify the unworthy) , and men are just pigs, thirsty for sex, unmerciful pimps.
It's notable that when the students' parents appear (which is very seldom), they are distant and mostly dissociated from their offspring, who have come to rule the roost as far as we can tell.
Shame really because it could have been good, especially when you remember that the original Exorcist wasn't released here in the UK for fourteen years!
With few priest having any real experience in dealing with the possessed, the church turns to Father Thomas Â a priest who we meet early in the film when an exorcism goes very bad leaving him blind.
The movie has touches of The Entity (such as when Gail is being visited at night); Stigmata (when Gail forms a cross and starts bleeding from her hands and feet); White Noise (when Gail sees ghostly images in the television) and naturally The Exorcist.
Instead, the film has quick edits of things jumping out at you, something quickly walking by the camera, and some great facial expressions from Roby Â when that girl screams it is down right creepy.
The screams that come out of the people in the movie are bloodcurdling, especially the older sister when she sees what is happening to her younger sister as the possession takes hold of her... it gives you chills!
The growl when Gail turns her head is a sweet sound byte, I think I'll use that for my "You've Got Mail" wav for GMail.
I cringed when they blatantly ripped off The Exorcist and Stigmata and actually laughed during the exorcism.
I had hoped that it would only end up with Ben falling in with Grant's crowd of under-achieving slackers, but instead it brought us back in time to when all stories about gay people ended in misery.
During all the movie youÂ´ve been looking forward til the end when the devil will appear and itÂ´ll be a hell of a fight.
A few scenes stand out, especially in the beginning when the priest begins trying to turn evil, and at the end with the appearance of Satan, but the middle section of the movie simply does not go far enough to really be satisfying.
The scenes with most tension and terror deal with the satanic ritual where a black goat appears and when the devil makes a terrifying appearance (standing up confronting JosÃ© Mari and throwing him out of the tower and then confronting the priest) I understand now how "Drag Me To Hell" got inspired in the use of shadows and the talking goat.
He is in charge to change the pace of the movie when it reaches levels of surrealism.
But when all preparations are set, Satan doesn't show up !
Generally I'm against so-called reviews which say 'for what it is it's whatever' but in this case, when something does manage to be genuinely unsettling, I give it a go.
Finally after a long wait I got the chance to check out this flick, and what a damn shame I wasn't more safe when buying it the first time, because this was a really good flick.
The special effects are hokey in true demonic horror style, and the light use of them ensures that they work well when used.
After watching this brilliant movie,I came to conclusion that(besides "Braindead")this is the best horror/comedy of the 90's.The acting is great,the characters are captivating,the photography is nice and the humour scenes are excellent.This is the first horror/comedy from Spanish director Alex de la Iglesia.Hey guy,I hope to hear about you soon.The funniest sequence is when the priest is looking for the blood of the virgin to summon Satan.On the other hand,this creative film beats any of these expensive pseudo-horror movies from Hollywood.If you are a real horror-fan like me you should check it out.
It get's even better when the beast/weapon gets loose.
The only real mishap may be that when the things that 'wait below' are revealed, they are quite disappointing, but in context this doesn't matter for long.
Working with the Anthropologists she helps extract long-dead remains but will scream when faced with a fresh one.
The buildup is painfully slow and when the 'mystery' is finally resolved, it's a real anti-climax (not giving anything away, let's say not exactly a Close Encounters moment) The idea of discovering creatures deep inside a tropical mountain landscape appealed to me, but `Secrets of the Phantom Caverns' is a letdown.
It's playing in theaters in just 3 cities so far, so make sure that you keep your eye out and catch it when it comes to your town.
It's playing in theaters in just 3 cities so far, so make sure that you keep your eye out and catch it when it comes to your town.
Anemone (Claire Trouabal)as soon as she appears will give you a hope quickly destroyed by GÃ¶tz Otto (one of the main actors (acting as Johnny Zucchini), unknown and certainly not ready to be discovered:-) Disappointing, confusing ... few funny scenes but why do we feel uneasy from beginning to end, you know, like when you drive a car with no gas thinking it can stop anytime?  
Every time when that guy mentions fraternal aid society, it just makes me laugh even harder.
(when describing herself).
I can't even imagine what must have been running through the directors head when he did this movie... without any doubt, this is the worst horror movie I have ever seen in my life!
I had not heard of this serial when it came out.
I stopped seeing local movies in the fall of 1940 when I was sent to boarding school.
He continually thwarts the crooks in their shady deeds, and it's quite a surprise when he is unmasked at the end of the film.
On the down side is redundancy (a trademark of all serials), absurdity (by himself, the hero defeats 6-8 baddies at once in fist fights, even when the baddies have guns!).
After getting mouth offed at by the guy at the voice box thing the two guys sneak in to beat the voice box guy, This when things start getting dumb.
Jean Gabin lacks energy as Valjean, with results of making his more active scenes (specially the one when he liberates himself from the chains to save the life of a fellow prisoner, and the one where he frees himself again, this time from ThÃ©nardier and his other captors) seem false and almost laughable.
Do you know when you start watching a movie and in the first 4/5 minutes you start asking yourself: "why doesn't it end right now?"
But, when this film was released in 1969 at the peak of the war, this was not only a very funny film, but a sad reality of the society of the times.
Then towards the end I guess she is just tired of dragging him and dogs looking at her so what does she do to her beloved new husband, who when they are rescued could lead a normal life with what there able to do with prosthetics these days...smothers him for no apparent reason just as a helicopter is in the distance.
The story begins when a couple of newlyweds decides to take a trip to the Grand Canyon.
like the mom when she tries to cry.
i was just flicking through channels when i saw an ad for reaper....directed by Kevin smith....now this came as a surprise to me as I'm usually up to date with his works....a regular on the IMDb page as well as the message boards...so decided to give it a go....mostly anything Kevin smith does (despite saying that after jay and silent bob strike back he was quiting the industry...) is good in my book :) and i was pleased to see that this was no exception....the plot is great...and not (as another user posted) like Shaun of the dead...similarities in certain things perhaps...but clearly not based on Shaun of the dead... i would however recommend this series to any fan of Kevin smith or even any fan of comedy...its a warm light hearted comedy about a kid whose just really not had the best start to being 21...:)
BUT and it is a big BUT i decided for something this special i had to pull my head out of the sand, tonight i watched the season finale and i have to say i had my eye on the clock out of fear of when it would end.
That isn't to say that there aren't serious moments in the show, but when we get them, it is SO unexpected that you suddenly realise things aren't all light-hearted and there is potential for some truly dark moments/themes to be explored.
Much of the cast looks boring compared to him: I never really liked any of the 'good' characters, but that makes it funnier when they're the victim of whatever the episode is about.
I also love the fact that all his friends want to help him (Sock and Ben), and do so.- when ever the boss (*The devil contacts - SAM)  He (SAM) has a love interest as well, who is incredible beautiful.(Andy).
I look forward to this show every week and will miss it when it goes off for the holidays.
Because when her mother was younger ...
So she showed up, and when he went to the door one of her friends went and put on a mask and he had a knife, and when he turned around and he saw him and passed out.
You see him as he tries to help Sam and when he is angry that smile disappears in a moment and you truly believe that there is Satan behind Ray Wise's eyes.
Quentin Tarantino rates this as the best movie of all time,and who am I to argue with him?I first saw this movie when I had first started surfing,and it really captured all that was great about the sport,and the way of life that surfing becomes.
As I have gotten older I can completely relate to the changes the characters go through,as even surfers have to grow up sometime,and its only then that you realize the significance of the more innocent times of youth when life really is a lot more simple and a whole lot of fun.
This movie is one I always revert to when I need some California Dreaming, so much comment a great tribute to John Milius and his superb Direction.
I loved this film when I was a kid and I know a lot of you have been having difficulty finding a copy.
I remember watching this film over and over on a VHS tape when I was little but that tape has long gone and I am aching for a DVD version.
I could be wrong but I think I saw the trailer for this when I saw The Swarm back in the 70s.I remember thinking "who is going to see this?"
We knew that wave sets came in cycles of seven, and that seventh wave was the most powerful... we learned everything there was to know about surfing from Jan and Dean when they sang RIDE THE WILD SURF...
I know when we have a few drinks, I see the old glint in their eyes that our youth is still alive and well inside, it's just having a lie down.
Best Scene: The flashback to the group of friends hugging and laughing- when times were good.
As it approaches the end, the movie gains rhythm; the final, in every sense, encounter with the big wave is rendered greatly, surfing action is truly gripping, we perceive the strong emotion when facing and struggling against this force of nature, and we also get more intimate with the characters's inner emotional world, probably because the confrontation between man and nature, with the undeniable sense of human finiteness as compared to the greatness of nature, always reveals the real quality of human life.
Undeniable that the movie delivers also funny moments, mainly when we see these guys pretending every kind of physical and mental distress, in order to avoid the spectre of Vietnam: really amusing.
John Milius's militant conservatism is somewhat subdued in this movie, though the movie was clearly made with a sense of nostalgia for a time when women and African-Americans knew their subjugated place and stayed there, and when going off to die pointlessly in an immoral war was seen as heroic and poignant.
The martial soundtrack, which tries to give the movie weight it otherwise lacks, is also unintentionally funny (I dare you not to laugh at the end when our three buddy-boy surfers march into the waves as to war, drums and trumpets blaring all up and down the beach).
Close friends, that's what we need when we begin to be scared of life.
Character Bear says something like "you need friends when you are in trouble".
Perhaps the greatest two scenes in the beginning come when Bear is making the "Big Wave board" and speaking of the day when "a swell so big will wipe everything that came before it".
A key scene comes when Matt the drunk goes to Bear for advice, and Bear again proves his wisdom.
A major element of change can be seen when in 1974 it is Bear who is the drunk and Matt is attempting to give him advice.
I saw this movie when it came out.
But when it all kicks off downstairs, and someone is thrown through a glass window, she's nowhere to be seen.
But you know The Graduate, when Benji is trying to locate Elaine in the final reel, and meets some jocks in a shower, and struggles to relate to them a bit.
A great feel-good movie from when movies still felt pretty good.
Thus, the emotion is genuine when we learn as does Gable that nothing is forever.
Not being a movie critic I cannot give a critique on the movie but when I watch a movie, I get INTO it; lost in the world that exists in the screen.
This movie was quite maligned when it came out.
First of all, Clark and Carole initially met filming "No Man Of Her Own" when Gable was loaned to Paramount in late 1932, while Lombard was married to William Powell; they got along well on the set, but no sparks flew and from all accounts they didn't keep in touch.
But when looking from a historical standpoint and becoming familiar with the real Clark Gable and Carole Lombard, one realizes how ridiculous this film really is.
I will grant that Clayburgh, perhaps, did all that she could to capture Lombard but certainly it did not seem so when watching this pathetic film.
You will die laughing when you see what Carole Lombard had knitted for Clark Gable and her cute little comment when she sees it might be too big for him to fit into.
He wears an Army uniform when in real life he didn't join until later.
2) At the crash site he is comforted by Lombard's press agent when in reality the press agent was killed in the crash as well.
3) The movie makes it appear that they kept their love life secret when in real life they often appeared together in public and made no secret of it.
Let's face it when you watch a story involving real people you imagine that most if not all of what you are seeing either really happened or is a close representation thereof.
Right when they pull up, they talk into the speaker and the person on the other end says a bunch of extremely vulgar and sexual remarks about the people in the car.
It was the line when Jack tells Wendy that, "I'm not going to hurt you, I'm just going to bash your brains in, right the *bleep* in".
That is until toward the end of the film, the mother of Mackenzie reveals that the man in the clown suit doing all the killing was bullied by them when they were all in high school.
Jim alone with his common-law wife Gloria,Norma Donaldson, begins to freak-out when he get's epileptic seizures with no medication on hand to relive them.
This incredible film was (mis)sold as a blaxploitation piece when it was released and, unfortunately, the label has stuck.
As it turns out, Mattelli is on the take and likes to take a snort when things get tough.
I don't always like comedy and horror mixed but this one did make me laugh hard and I liked the story.It had some really good kills and some hysterical original humour.The whole revenge storyline is old but a good and effective one.It reminded me a lot of Nightmare on Elm street how a bunch of parents killed a guy and he comes back from the dead to exact revenge on the kids of the parents.Of course Nightmare on Elm street was more of a horror.I hated the first scene of drive-thru.I cannot stand it when white kids act and talk like they're black,especially the well educated ones.Watching the way they were acting and talking made me cringe.
Bullets when fired do their jobs and never leave anyone alive in this violent and greedy world.
There are some experiments into the sound itself, like for instance during the beginning when the sound of the musical instruments tuning is intercut with sounds of nature to play with the idea of the potential rhythmic qualities inherent in nature.
Of course, when the TV program cuts off, he sees something I am sure she didn't mean for him to see.
I only discovered Resnais very recently, when I saw the masterpiece Providence.
Since then, I've been keeping an eye out for his films, so when this turned out to be showing as part of the French Film Festival, I knew I had to see it.
It was hard to really sympathize with the former, and I thought the latter was a little odd - it seemed like she was overacting for humorous effect, which was fine, but when it came to her making a serious point, you weren't sure how to take it exactly.
Alas, none of the six are really happy, hardly even content; the bible-reading Azema possibly comes closest, smiling as she cleans up after unseen invalid Claude Rich - even cleaning HERSELF up when he throws food over her; Isabelle Carre is a little young to be the sister of Andre Dussollier but given her loveliness there's no real reason for her to pursue true love in the Lonelyhearts columns.
OK i love horror movies every one of them make me laugh even when they are not under comedy.
I last remember seeing it on regular old commercial television when I was a child back in 1977.
Horny is a colourful and visually striking psycho-villain, but the climax of the movie is quite weak, and the only scene that delivers a genuine frisson is when the killer clown empties a gasoline can over Mac as she's tied to a chair (as a prelude to immolating her), and she starts screaming in complete, helpless terror.
The feud between Fire and Water started along time ago, when the two siblings, Oceanus - God of Water (Sirius' father), and Hyperia - Goddess of Fire (Malta's mother), lived in peace and dearly loved each other.
The voices of Walter Pidgeon and George Murphy are easily recognized; the animation is quite entertaining, especially when it showed the Swastika turning into a map of Germany or the dragon changing into the Japanese islands.
While nowadays, many in Hollywood have a bit of nostalgia for the old Soviet Union (or at least use moral relativism to make the Western nations seem somehow comparable to it), this was a time when there was great dread of Communism spreading everywhere--thanks to statements by Stalin himself that they would do so.
Round six is when Russia is attacked by Germany and reaches out to Britain and America again.
Round seven is when the Second World War ends, and Russia becomes a threat to Western democracy.
Back when he was poor he was living hand to mouth with a near do well father, Frank Morgan, and a gentle mother who took in washing because her husband couldn't hold down a job.
Anyway when young Gene Reynolds grows up to be Robert Taylor he's now supporting dear old dad who's still drinking and gambling.
Those two habits are nearly the undoing of his son when he falls into the hands of rival gamblers Edward Arnold and Nat Pendleton.
Maureen O'Sullivan carries off the role of the young, college girl love interest with the same innocence she displayed when she broke into films 9 years and 39 films earlier.
I have to admit that when I was younger, I didn't get the spoofs: Owl Jolson and Jack Bunny.
It always makes me laugh when the little owl heads over to radio station G-O-N-G!
I'm always impressed when low budget movies don't look low budget.
But when his folks show up, he thinks his fun is over, so he quickly tries to disguise his red-hot boogie woogie and starts singing some sappy ol' funeral parlor tune or somethin', which really doesn't jive with the deejay.
I had looked for it unsuccessfully based on a description a neighbor girl gave me when I was 23.
I saw this cartoon for the first time when I was under the age of ten, didn't know it was a "movie spoof" (which is mentioned in other sources)until I became an adult.
I think I was about 6 or 7 when I first saw this amazing takeoff on the Jazz Singer.
Papa Owl, a strict sort, is pleased when his wife has four eggs.
The three are in Stevens' house when the time arrives, along with the niece, her fiancÃ©e and two servants, but still they can't prevent that the killer Â known as "the Gorilla" strikes at midnight.
a rich dude is threatened by a serial killer called The Gorilla, so he hires three bumbling detectives (the Ritz Brothers) to serve as body gourds, but all hell breaks loose when the serial killer lets a real Gorilla loose in the house.
Here's what doesn't make sense when the film is over and the "gorilla" killer is revealed.
We never seem to know why the gorilla is targeting those who he eventually does in until the the very end of the movie which, the explanation, is so off-the-wall and confusing that when the movie is finally over your still not quite sure who the killer, or gorilla, is!
This gorilla escaped from his keeper when he was bopped over the head by the other gorilla in order to have his, peaceful and law abiding, gorilla take the rap for the crimes that he committed.
The movie gets some props for generally trying to have fun with the hidden passageways motif and Bela Lugosi's usual outrageousness, but the problem with camp is that when it's camp horror, it's funny, and when it's camp comedy, it's not, meaning that this movie is kind of suspended between both by boredom and disinterest.
And when The Gorilla focuses on the mystery/horror elements of the plot, it's pretty creepy and good.
There's some great dialogue between characters, particularly Mario and Nicole when they first meet and there's a few funny moments too.
I can sit back and watch full grown woman destroy some boomers (as well as half of Tokyo) and reminisce about my childhood when cartoon characters swore and every battle was followed by a gratuitous nude scene.
I loved City of God it was a classic and when i first heard this was coming out i was overjoyed.
but when i finally saw it i felt it needed more spice to it if you know what i mean.
They find that their fathers are intertwined, and there are some tense moments when the two deal with their friendship.
I realized after, when I watched the DVD out-takes, that this was based on a TV series so that may be a reason for those difficulties.
This is what happens when distributors try to seek a wider audience (ridiculous sweeping shots of the Rio coastline, etc) at the expense of a gripping story and characters.
Ace abandons Clayton on the beach early on when MadrugadÃ£o (Midnight, Jonathan Haagensen), the gang leader of the hill where they live, risks assassination to descend on a super-hot day for a swim in the ocean.
And when Cris gets a job in the wealthier city of SÃ£o Paulo, Ace, with great difficulty, forces himself to take on the responsibility of raising Clayton.
Ace is immature enough to leave Clayton alone on the beach in an early sequence but must grow up quickly and assume complete responsibility for Clayton's care when Cris takes a job in Sao Paolo.
Fatherhood -- in a social milieu where most kids grow up fatherless -- is the key theme here: Acerola is now a teen dad who has to take care of his baby boy when his teen wife moves to SÃ£o Paulo to work as a babysitter; and Laranjinha is on the search of the identity of his unknown father, only to discover he's alive and is an ex-convict on parole.
when characters like Caju (the dim-witted, glamor-seeking teenager who joins the drug gang) or those really original characters -- the teenage girls that have "upgraded" from "gangsta molls" to becoming gangstas themselves -- screamed for attention and development.
Simple, I've studied this ship and dreamed of raising it since I, was a child in the 1960's of course these dreams were dashed when Dr. Ballard found the wreck in pieces.
Cameron clearly is _only_ interested in seeing the old ship, and imagining--with some interesting special effects fill-ins--what it was like back when.
I found that feeling never left me for the duration of the film, even when I made an involuntary movement to catch a rope thrown at us to more fully exploit to wonders of 3-D.
It is also fascinating when they shoot the real Titanic on the see bottom.
I remember when the show first aired on CBS television.
I loved watching this show back when it first aired, and I loved watching it recently on DVD.
Did he have an edge when Lucy got the hots for a Hispanic?
Even though I was not a major fan of either star, I found the movie to be sad because I never realized just how bright their early careers had been, and how much they had going for them when they became so popular with the "I Love Lucy" show.
I liked how it started out with the beginning of I Love Lucy and flashes back to when Lucille Ball meets Desi Arnaz.
I like them from back when they were new, so I still do.
Cates job goes on the line when he kills a suspect who's gun cannot be found after the shooting.
And the so called surprise when the identity of the Iceman is revealed is about as believable as Frosty The Snowman.
Things go bad for Hammond when his car gets blown away, was shot at when he was in the prison bus.
I liked the part when the biker went right through the movie screen.
It was funny when Reggie finally took the lighter from Cates after he was shot.
powell was always a class act, but MGM had given up on lamarr by 1943, when it was evident wartime audiences were not excited by her lack of charisma.
Things get complicated when journalist LLoyd Hunter enters the picture and falls for Vicky.
Nowhere in the film was it explained how she came to give birth to the Duvall character when she was only 2 years old.
(SPOILER COMING) Even when he is about to be arrested for the murder of his wife's lover, we still have to put up with 20 minutes of preaching and singing and shouting and praising the Lord before the police can finally lead him away.
when Duval performed his final sermon.
Duvall directed himself in this story about an evangelist who embarks on a self-assigned mission to save souls when his own life goes wrong.
11 PM rolls around, I'm drunk again, and that's when I heard Robert Duvall saying a prayer in the opening scene of "The Apostle" From that moment, I was hooked.
I love the moment when Blackwell tells Duvall how black he sounds on the radio for a white man.
As for being inspired spiritually, I almost cried when Duvall prayed over Billy Bob, "Troublemaker."
I was taught a year or so ago the phrase "Preach the gospel at all times: when necessary, use words."
There are some good messages in here, including the one that you reap what you sow, and accepting that even when it's bad news and you wind up paying for your sins.
It deserves your attention when you loved Ong-bak and the Russian Night Watch because it's a perfect combination of those two.
I have this movie on tape so that I can show my son when he grows up.
saw this movie in the theater when it came out in 86 just a fun to watch romp set in ww1 that the whole family can watch is it full of state of the art special effects?
There must they party (when they see two lovely ladies) of course and get into a bet with two English flyer's, that they naturally can fly an airplane...
*Note - The version I saw contained some sort of fuzzy pixelization censorship of a) cigarettes when in someone's mouth but not in their hands, and b) guns when pointed directly at someone in the same frame.
While the plot of this film may seem trite to us today, it was fresh and original in 1932 when it was made.
I've been a fan of the novel for quite a long time, in fact one of the publishing agents came to give a lecture when I was in college on the nature of getting your work published and kept citing the due to be released novel as an example and even then the premise he described sounded amazing.
I finally got around to reading it when it went into paperback and it's a book I have recommended countless times to people of all ages and interests.
First of all, it immediately removes the mystery of Henry's first meeting with Claire at the Library, when he is 28 and she is 20.
A few things that are major events in the book are treated as non-events in the movie, for example, the fact that Henry's first time travel was out of the car when his mother died is the very first thing revealed in the movie, when it is something of a breakthrough mental moment for Henry in the book.
On another note, the movie does a terrible job of tracking when things happen and how old the characters are.
By now in his late forties and sporting an obvious, bright red hairpiece, Charlton Heston seemed an odd Antony when first seen.
Yet...when the horse's arse gets shot by a hunter...he has no problem coming back to the 'present' with a bullet and wound in his side which, thankfully kills him and ends this dribble of a movie.
It may be a great novel - I haven't read it - but the film is contrived - why bother at all with the time travel nonsense when you want to make a four hankie woman's weepie?!
In fact, when I think about it, it's one of my all-time favorite books hands down.
But so very often, you read a really good book and when it is made into a movie, it never measures up to the book.
I wasn't a big fan of Eric Bana when I first saw him in Hulk and even Munich.
We end up going back in time to see her as a child, meeting a late-30s Henry, but only in flashbacks and memories from when the two 20-something versions of them meet.
"The Time Traveler's Wife" is a delightful love story with an original romance of a time traveler that wins the heart of his wife when she was six years old and he was older.
Believe me when I say "Time Traveler" is the better of the two.
We learn that he doesn't have much control over when he will dematerialize, except that it often seems to be triggered by stress or excitement, so we can imagine the effect this would have on his love life.
Thus it's no surprise that he's a bit of a mess when, working his Chicago job as a research librarian, he's approached by Clare Abshire, a woman he's never seen before, who professes that she's been in love with him for decades Â and that it's been mutual.
He gazes upon Alba with such love when she says, "I love you Daddy!"
I had read the book three times when it first came out, so I was excited when I got tickets to an advance screening.
She was sniffly when we left and now has the book.
Something I often find bothersome in 'time travel fiction' is that there is usually a large chunk of the storytelling dedicated to the tedium of explaining 'how' time travel works, particularly when time travel is merely a device to aid the storytelling.
It's kind of like when you share stories from your past with friends and significant others, retelling them time and again until your experiences are indistinguishable from theirs, except in the case of Henry and Clare, the experiences are real if not linear.
Kate Maberly delivers a wonderful performance as Mary Lennox, the spoiled little girl who is sent to live with her uncle, the reclusive Lord Craven, when her parents die of cholera in India, an event which never seems to affect her since her parents were always too busy for her anyway.
The movie diverts from the book almost immediately, but mostly when Mary goes to Misselthwaite Manor.
I can never understand why they would do things like that when making books into movies.
I remember the day my mom bought the movie for me when it came out on VHS and I just couldn't stop watching it!
Also when Collin comes face to face with his father for the first time!!
Like when she went at night to find Colin, the music and the camera-work and that scary blanket with the ugly boy on it covering Colin's room gave it an eerie kind of vibe.
i would recommend this film to the girls aged around 4&10 even though i may be a little bit old for this film i still feel the same way i did for this film when i was younger.
i was only 4 when film came out but i can remember watching this film over and over again and i would never be sick of watching it.
I love this movie & often wish that my family could live where they did.I first found out about it when I was little from my mother- it's a good mother/daughter movie.I don't own it yet but will very soon so my daughter can watch it.I hope that she loves it just like I did (still do) The are some sad parts in the movie where it shows how Collins mother died & the garden was never open again.It took a little girl with a kind heart to win over her uncle-in-law in order for him to let her have the key.To me this movie says that anything is possible with love & care & that children are brilliant,not only do they learn from us but we can learn from them as well.I think that the parents that are too busy & have way too many things going on in their daily schedule need to take time out to watch this movie & do something with their children.There is a plot of land next to us here where we live that I want to make a garden out of & I want my kids to help with it (: thanks mom & to all mothers everywhere (patting myself on the back- I'm a mom too (:
Ah, the many memories I have with The Secret Garden, I have to admit it, when I was a kid, I had this group of girlfriends and we always thought it would be so cool if we discovered a garden just like the children in this movie did.
In a time when more and more films are relying on special effects rather then a good script and a decent storyline, this is one that film makers everywhere should take note of.
As in the Lord of the Rings, it is not a Jedi Knight, or a superman or muscleman or gun-slinging cowboy who is the hero, it is one of the common folks who rises to the occasion when greatness is demanded by the times and situation.
(2) Immediately after the assassination, a promise by Brutus to Antony's servant of safe conduct for Antony, who thus knows when he comes to the Capitol and weeps over Caesar's body, challenging the conspirators to kill him also, that there is no danger of their doing so.
I have never played the games, since I'm a chicken when it comes to horror games, and my brother had.
There are also some major holes, like there is a point where everybody is surrounded by zombies right when they first get attacked, then the scene changes and some of the team are just running, wow, I guess the zombies just let them by eh?
Or I love the fact that these people come back to the team later on in the movie and yet again, didn't have to deal with the dozens zombies they had to walk through to get back to their team (which you hear hitting the door when thye close it).
The effects are good, especially at the part when the laser beam starting to move, down and up or in the middle, now, that's something.
That's not what you get in Jason Robards, Jr. For a man who in his time was considered the greatest interpreter of Eugene O'Neill, when it comes to Shakespeare the man was out of his league.
I had my worries when i saw Paul Anderson because i hated Event Horison And i hated AvP ( grrr avp is the worst movie ever made, it brought shame to both franchises ) but to my surprised it was pretty damn good.
Resident evil has always been one of my favorite game series and when I heard about this film I just had to see it, so I sat down on my bed and watch it on TV and was like...Awesome!
In my opinion when it comes to games like resident evil that have various story lines and many characters, it's kinda boring for a fan of the games to see the same characters and final bosses all over again, but this film has such an original resident evil storyline and original characters that I can easily see this movie fit in with story of the game without compromising the game.
I first viewed the film when I was six and then I didn't understand English good.
There are times in the movie that he portrays Caesar well as the aloof dictator and others when he overacts as he does in most of his roles.
When the film was announced I thought it was going to be rubbish because mostly films that are based on games are completely crap especially the ones made by Uwe Boll, but I still went to see it the first day when it came out in the UK and it was sooooo amazing.
The main thing is that they control the Hive, but that gets more difficult when the virus has turned the people it killed into the living dead, zombies.
There are so many great scenes, but my favorite was when Alice saw the evil dogs and they chased her throughout the lab, it was really scary but so awesome to watch.
As a big fan of splatter and horror films i was gladly surprised when i watched this.
I wasn't waiting to see anything amazing when I started watching for this movie, since almost all the license movies have been terrible... Fortunately, my opinion was to change!
It's not exactly too surprising to us the viewing audience when we learn Khorda is actually a vampire preying on these clueless, direction-less kids.
I also like the inventiveness shown at the end when the film takes a number of unexpected twists and turns I never saw coming on first viewing.
The film takes place in the early 70s, when hippies were still around, and on the fringes of society.
Back in the '70s, when cable TV first came to Northeastern Pennsylvania, subscribing meant the addition of three channels: WPHL 17, out of Philly, WPIX 11, out of New York, and WORTV 9, also out of New York.
His unique style when directing his works has not always been accepted by an audience of which the majority are used to much more mainstream, commercial films.
Merhi is an overwrought genius whose presentation, when grouped with the textual gold of Kanganis' script and the on screen presence of Hilton-Jacobs of such charm and without antecedence is, frankly, magical.
Just before they're shot, all the actors look like you do when you're going to pop a balloon, stiff and all, cus you know the bang is coming.
WRITING: There are too many inexplicable nonsense scenes, like when the urban gangster punks bust into the cop's house and play darts with the lights off.
I saw this movie when it first came out.
A story which shows us the trials of finding yourself, and what you have to do when it is time, will you sit there when problems arise or will you fight!?
The planet contains a population of relatively disillusioned human beings who, when not complaining or uni-bike racing, raise armies to try and control the planet.
It is a rare event when I rate a movie on the level of a 10, but if I could, I would go even higher for this film.
While, when I was young, I did not capture the fantastic beauty of such a sweet story, I did feel something that nothing else gave me.
My favorite scene was when the heroes are fleeing a swarm of dangerous, sword wielding Arabs through the narrow streets of a busy Muslim city.
I can promise you will find this film amusing, when you'll see 'Laska' coming home, reminiscing his dad or 'Grucha' wearing his pink sweater and falling in love with the prostitute.
The plot is as follows: Two college students (one who has major problems when it comes to women), decide to higher prostitutes and have a good time.
It starts off with a great song sung by the Stooges and when the shopping begins I just love the guy that selling the food as he yells about the Stooges jumping on his food cart.
I also love when the Stooges are in the French Foreign Legion.
I really loved the opening where they got into trouble with their rent and the police, and then they accidentally joined the Foreign Legion, and when the Capitan they were supposed to guard got captured, they then dressed up as Santa Claus in order to go and rescue him!
"This should be worth a fortune when I'm dead."
This one trick pony becomes all the more annoying when the end arrives without any resolution.
In one scene, upstairs in the woman's family home, you can twice see the set walls shake when doors are shut.
Melvyn Douglass and Fred McMurray are great as the husbands in question and it was funny when Bill (McMurray) realizes that his best friend Henry (Douglass) has been sleeping with his wife!
It was not actually spoken that he realized it but when Henry talked about having children the realization came to him.
We've been down this road before in movies, but let's remember that when MacMurray shows up alive, her marriage to Douglas no longer legally exists.
Arthur plays a woman married to the best friend of her dead husband, who's mighty surprised when her dead husband turns out not to be so dead after all.
Jean Arthur is enjoyable, as always, but her choice of men is rather depressing, and there isn't any fun in her predicament when the hubbies are this selfish and childish.
However, when Bill comes back from the dead via a boat from the island he'd been shipwrecked on, the happy Lowndeses become a strange threesome.
Boy is she surprised when Bill shows up alive.
He's very funny, his voice cracking when he's upset.
For example, no town, no matter HOW corrupt, would have crooked judges who issue release orders (writs of habeas corpus) the second the crime is committed or before the person is even charged--especially when it appears they will be up on murder charges!!
The stereotypical choppiness of the frames from 20's movies rarely occurs, except when there is much fast action.
Kathy says what we're all thinking when we watch A-listers on the red carpet, or see them on talk shows pimping their latest project.
This film was pretty sensitive to the Indians' cause, and also showed that the white man could also get along with the Indians when they showed true Christian character towards them.
She doesn't hold back when she gets started on celebrities.
The best is when she tears into Eminem.
It is nice to see someone that can be so politically incorrect, and just having fun, when everyone else is so uptight.
I laughed hard when I realized they were going do do a remake of the "Tom Cruise jumps in Oprah Winfrey's lounge" but my laugh got stuck in my throat quickly as they overdid it.
The funniest moments come from unexpected twists..when a certain movie is hilariously and unexpectedly ridiculed or when the current antics of one certain galaxy translating, love crazed megastar are exploited, but as usual these end up being the exception to the stale, repetitive humor.
The funniest scene to me is when Cindy and Brenda arrive at 'The Village'.
On the cover of Scary Movie i got it had an Ape on it ,what was that all about.I watched the movie expecting to see King Kong was disappointed when there wasn't.I like the movie otherwise.Another comment is why do they keep bringing back some of the characters that was killed off in the first 1?
For example, a real laugh could occur at the point in the movie when the dim-witted President ignores a global alien attack in order to listen to a children's' story.
Now when the next couple of scenes contain about 25 instances of people being hit with things, and three fart/poop/gross-out jokes, any substance the film actually had is washed away - or shall i say clubbed to death by blunt objects.
You could easily tell when a joke was coming seconds before it happened and most of the time you could probably predict exactly what it was going to be.
For example, when the grudge kid begins crawling down those stairs in his creepy way, you know he's going to fall down it.
Another example is during the village parody, when they are all having a meeting and the blind woman comes in to go to the "toilet"...Toilet humour is funny though...if you are about 3!
Cindy and Tom meet and fall in love for each other, but when Giant Tripods invade Earth, Tom escapes with Robbie and Rachel; Cindy travels to a village, trying to find the answer to a riddle to save the world; and the president of USA organizes the defense of the planet in UN under his intelligence and leadership.
Further, when I see this type of movie, I know exactly what I am going to see: scatological jokes, funny and surrealistic references to other films and definitely a movie that will never be indicated for an Oscar.
What do they expect to see when they go to the movie theaters or buy / rent a DVD called "Scary Movie 4" ("the last part of a trilogy"), directed by David Zucker and with Leslie Nielsen and Anna Farris in the cast?
I started watching this show when I was sick and there wasn't much to watch during daytime TV.
In my opinion the movie should have primarily been a Saw parody.The character of Tom Ryan had potential but he is shown as a dumb ass when he should have been a direct parody of Cruise.Yes there are moments of potential but they are too few and far between.
Sad really because the genre has brought laughs when other comedies failed.
The Scary Movie parody wagon has been rolling since 2000, when the Wayans Brothers pooled their considerable comedic talents and came up with a kitchen sink flick that riffed on mainly horror movies Â with just a little Matrix thrown in.
But things start looking up when she meets her handsome new neighbor, Tom Ryan (Craig Bierko).
The only bet they really missed was a zombie movie spoof (when Brenda returns from the dead Â The Ring curse killed her in Scary Movie 3 Â it's just glossed over).
The direction is impressively effective, being dramatic when it should be.
Worse still, there were times when it was difficult to tell what was going on.
If this were done on purpose, if the direction taken when making this was to show how chaotic these fights were, then it would have been a good creative call.
It also blends fact and fabrication in a way that seems fair and reasonable so that the viewer has been well served when the credits roll.
A death occurs, and although Chris is innocent of it, it looks like the blame will fall on him, particularly when Bert forces Chris to make repeat visits to the club.
Otherwise it's hard to really differentiate when we're supposed to be scared, excited, thrilled, or really feel much of anything because nothing really slows down long enough to build a sense of tension or drama in the scenes.
Worse is when, at the end, a bit of voice-over repeats what a character stated less than a minute before hand, showing indeed one of those pesky and annoying horror movie motifs where apparently the director or producer or maybe the studio or something decided that the audience wasn't intelligent enough to get the point (plus, it leads the way to a possible sequel, which is predictable).
At least somebody had their thinking cap on when conceiving this thing... or at the very least were taking some heavy duty crazy pills.
To make matters worse, a tedious black and white prologue complete with unnecessary voice-over stains the beginning of the film, hinting too much at the later goings-on when it would have been more fun to learn the truth as the film surges forward.
I also enjoyed the days when Eric (Jensen Ackles) was on the show.
I live in the town and attended the school where this took place around the time when it occurred.
Then there's the fact that this is a movie from a time long forgotten - a time when smoking cigarettes on screen was accepted and normal, when the PC brigade wasn't around and you could light up whenever and wherever you wanted - these guys go through pack after pack - in the car, in the office (god forbid..), and Boyle even lights up while his colleagues are having lunch right next to him.
I remember seeing this when it debuted on TV (well, the first part at least) and finally got to catch up with it again.
I was just a child when all this was going on and don't remember the newscasts about it.
What really happened on that night when three innocent lives were taken?
I had to stop again very quickly when they gave MEDICALLY INACCURATE information about abortions and tried to demonize the choice to not carry a fetus to term.
Occasionally I'll sneak a peak (when they brought back Frankie) but I am unable to watch more than a few minutes before I get disgusted/angry.
Nowadays ALL the music at any bar or restaurant or a character is listening to is always country (except when they do a rare unsubtle promotional stunts like Rolling Stones or Smokey Robinson).
This film shows exactly what don't like in Hollywood ;the real nature of sexual relationships ,that's the reason why a superb film like this never will won an Oscar.It shows the extreme passion that everybody can feel about somebody ;your life could be like one of the characters of the film , you only has to meet somebody really special , and ,If you think you never would do the things the characters of this film made ,you will instantly change your opinion , why?, because when you are absolutely in love with somebody , you would anything for that person that make you feel so good...That is the human nature.
Other great true this film shows is the sad side that everybody has ;when you know you can do what you want with somebody ,you do it...This means that you make suffer that person (that has fall in love with you), only for pleasure...that is how the mankind is.
I remember when I saw it first in the early nineties that it got bad reviews at the time.
The degradation continues when they meet Grant and Thomas on a cruise and Grant is panting to get a chance with Seigner.
This is most apparent when Nigel spends more time with Oscar and hears of his deconstructing of Mimi as he delves into the past.
But rather than demonise these interests, fetishes or notions; Bitter Moon gets across a state of wrong-doing, a sense that the repercussions of these activities when used despairingly can bring about ill-fated results, confusion and can form cracks within the relationship.
Our minds are wary when we think back to an early chapter in their story when Oscar and Mimi bask in front of a glowing log fire whilst inhabiting an apartment in Paris, one that encompasses a perfect view of the Eiffel Tower as it stands there, not so far away in that you cannot see it, but not directly on it's front door step.
His world, in which he would submit to the presence of Mimi purely to feed a curiosity and because he was able to, but would later find himself on the other foot when she submits to him; his world, in which ego driven positions of power were exploited and the phrase 'what goes around, comes around' didn't exist Â not least, until now.
Few critics took this film seriously when it was released, but it's now steadily beginning to garner attention.
Even when the sexual excitement wears off, Mimi is still in love.
I will admit that when I first started watching it, there seemed to be more romance with the main couples (Bo and Hope, John and Marlena) and that some of the story lines in recent years have really affected these relationships.
Oscar's character even tries to elevate the beauty and desirability of the less stunning Fiona's character when he says, "But I find your own brand of beauty more subtle.....as that inimitably British quality......a kind of reticence that hints of untapped potentiality."
We see that Oscar, when given this rare opportunity in the eyes of the average man, totally blows it and ruins a most ideal relationship.
Unfortunately, knowing Polanski's historical tragedies, I would think that he is telling us that we are probably no better than Oscar when it comes to successfully nurturing the ideal relationship.
Ken Corday let go of an incredible amount of potential for amazing storytelling when he decided that "Jack" had to leave with "Jennifer".
I'm saddened to see that a show that I watched from 1965-1992 and then started watching again when Steve and Matt and Mary Beth returned is still going to be so terrible.
The Director is Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) who started out as Sheilds' partner when they were a young Producer/Director team finding it hard to land a job.
However when the film is released and Lorrison becomes the new Hollywood sensation, Sheilds drops her like a hot potato, an act made even more callous by the fact he is already with another woman and had probably been so all the time.
Of course we're steered in the former direction not only by Douglas's terrific performance but also by the clever concluding scene when Sullivan, Turner and Powell, all with ample reason to have nothing do with him, still find themselves effortlessly drawn into his comeback plans.
Houseman and Minnelli were considering a character actor from the studio's supporting ranks for the role of producer Harry Pebbel when Walter Pidgeon put in a bid for the role.
Grahame and Roland are accidentally killed and when Powell finds out about the sub rosa arrangement he belts Douglas and goes on to a successful career as novelist and screenwriter.
And when he himself directs a movie that doesn't work, he shelves it, although the move means near bankruptcy.
Maybe I'm picky but aside from "The Postman Always Rings Twice," she always embarrassed me when she was on screen.
The first classic shot is when Lana Turner is doing her character's powerfully emotional final scene in the movie she's shooting.
Alternately, there are tremendous insights into the creative process, such as when Shields proposes the concept of scaring people by uncertainty and shadows when called on to make a thriller influenced by the actual film Cat People.
The best, however, has to be when Georgia finds a tawdry starlet (played acerbically by Elaine Stewart, who much later became a game show hostess) descending the stairs at Shields' mansion at which point she flees and drives with Hollywood-style abandon in her car.
Bad is a terrific movie, right up there with Sunset Boulevard when it comes to movies about Hollywood.
The constant comment that the anti-hero of the film, "Jonathan Shields" (Kirk Douglas) is dismissed as a "genius" is like the disparagement shown to boy-genius Welles when he showed up in Hollywood.
It is only when the film is in the can that he breaks it off, rather roughly.
Later he too realizes it was Fred's work, and ironically the collapse of Jonathan's position is begun when Von Ellstein lectures Jonathan on how you can't just stuff a film with a series of climaxes but have to build to one.
This brings some of the great scenes ever shown about movie-making, such as the moment when Amiel, the director, tries to put Jonathan in his place about how a scene should be shot, "in order to direct a picture you need humility".
Another comes with the moment when Jonathan and his soon to be 'asistant to the producer' has to object out of just being stunned.
Check the scene when Lana Turner discovers how Douglas betrayed her.
Hollywood is not forgiving to those who dare to show its ugly side and that's when the parallel with Orson Welles problems with the system and eventual exile can be drawn.
So much so, that 20 yrs since watching an episode when I saw the whole series on DVD for sale online I decided to order it.
I was so excited when I received my package that I thought I'd have a Thundercats marathon with my older sister (who also loved it) about halfway through the first disc (there's about 14 discs all up) I couldn't remember why I loved this cartoon so much?
I guess when you're older you pick up their silly mistakes, such as when they introduced new characters (such as bengaly and pumara) the old characters (such as cheetara & tigra) disappeared off the face of 3rd earth.
Their future leader, Liono is but a child when they leave their planet, but thanks to a pod malfunction he ages to an adult while the others in the group essentially stay the same age.
In a time when Anime was not yet that popular in the U.S., the creators of ThunderCats had the sensibility to try something new, to make ThunderCats stand apart by using Japanese cartoonists.
In a time when heroes were macho beyond macho, Lion-O had the vulnerability of having the mind of a child trapped in the body of an adult, the result of his body aging while spending 10 Galacto years in a suspension capsule.
Never bought any of the toys but i think it was because i was just slightly too old for it when the toys and TV show came out in the UK.
I started watching it when I was a teenager.. about 5 years ago..
There wasn't much action, and when there was action, it didn't last long, and it was fake.Thank god MST3K was there to make it enjoyable!
Yes, you know what Hercules and the queen were doing when not on screen.
For example, when Hercules meets the old king in the cave, the use of colored gel lighting in the scene simply screams Bava.
After all, he had been on an important mission of state with his wife the virtual hostage of a madman when all this happened.
I cried and cried when he episodes of him dying were on.
I remember when Steve and Kayla got married and she got her voice back just in time to say her wedding vows.
Plain and simply, when are they going to put it on DVD?
I loved the film and want to buy it when it comes out on DVD.
Perhaps one of the toughest moments that anyone could have to face is the loss of a loved one-especially when it is due to cancer.
It is what the women of Yorkshire, England believed when one of their beloved persons was lost.
That may sound ridiculous but the PBS News Hour and occasionally CNN do it regularly when Iraqis or Pakistanis or Afghans, for example, are being interviewed in English that is hard for viewers to understand.
The movie feels a little bit longer than it should be, and when they arrive in Hollywood, some parts are unnecessary (the washing powder scene).
I was drawn into Days in Dec. '06 when Chelsea was treating Nick horribly - just before he turned into 'The Lonely Splicer'.
Family gets neglected, the true and original vision gets forgotten, and the press can be a real son of a ----- when they don't represent themselves properly.
I'm not saying I want to see 50+ year old women naked, not at all, please, but when the issue of nudity is fundamental to the whole story line, I think you need to deliver.
Like many people I know, I look forward to the weekend as a chance to unwind and escape, especially when there's a new movie to rent - and sometimes, the latest zombie flick or murder mystery just won't do.
This is what happens when the writers run out of ideas and take to bizarre stories just to keep the show running.
One is reminded of the movie Outbreak, in which the US Army is portrayed as the villain by Hollywood, when in truth Army doctors saved people from a vicious virus outbreak, as Richard Preston documented in his excellent book, The Hot Zone.
I was 8 years old when the film came out, but oddly enough I can relate to it, more so on a subconscious level as I hardly remember being eight.
The story line does remind me of when I was a kid, a time when kids played outdoors using nothing more than their imagination and whatever they could find to play with and being content.
I remember hearing about the events in this movie on the radio, when they were actually taking place.
According to the film, when Romero was instated as archbishop it was only because he was viewed as an intellectual moderate who would keep the church from getting too involved in the political affairs of the country.
I am reluctant to admit this, but when Funshine sings about going home... and questions about whether or not he is making the right choice, I cried.
So, when I saw that there was a new movie, in CGI, I was a bit skeptical.
That happened when Funnybone would try to get into the vault where the treasure was hidden and the computer was much like Hal from 2001.
(A really good thing "The Princess and the Pauper" and "Twice upon a Christmas" managed to escape so far...)  Everyone's favourite bears are back, and at the beginning of this new DTV movie, they are all preparing for their annual fair when, all of a sudden, something goes wrong: as Grumpy Bear's newest carousel invention goes out of control, Funshine Bear's jokes about the mishap are sent the wrong way, and at once he decides to run away from the magical land of Care-a-lot.
For those who have seen the trailer at amazon.com and the official Care Bears web site, the Joke-a-lot anthem is a worthy, congratulatory sing-along (when the movie premiered on Disney Channel on December 12th, I had a great time singing along with it).
Yet I am still hoping for better to come when another movie is made.
Rossi and Billy eventually team up after a number of confrontations when Billy's sister and Rossi's reporter girlfriend Helen (Played by Bobbie Phillips) are kidnapped by Kasajian's gang.
Why was the doc killing himself when he knew the consequence of alchol?
The movie is VERY slow throughout the middle of the film and the ending is so bizarre that I was very irritated when the credits began to roll.
Basically, it showed her sneaking downstairs to snag some of the formula while her husband went to town (what did she do to get the drug all those months when her husband DIDN'T go to town?)
I think it's sad when a movie has to have it's back story explained on IMDb message boards rather than during the film.
even when she is locked up only in her bedroom?
Even if the film was terrible, there was no way, when it came out in the early 70s, that anyone was going to call it less than a masterpiece, an instant classic, if you will.
The conflict in her mind is exposed by her enticing Georgio but turning cold when he makes the moves on her.
Then finally when he saw she had sex with someone completely different from him and her---and she even turns the light on to show him---he snaps out of it.
Survival of one's identity has been the cause of much suffering when outside, physical, uncontrollable reality intrudes.
During one scene, in which Giorgio is kicked out of a public library, de Sica makes it clear that when the world begins to collapse, it's never anyone's fault.
So it's better to die young, when there's still time left to recover and live again".
It gets even more complicated, when Booth kills one of the pursuing FBI agent's partner.
It shows had badly constructed the episode was when you've got to include crap like that
And when the news report of the eruption comes on, the first thing they say is that Harry Truman was at his lodge and David Jackson, the 'Young Geologist' was on the face of the mountain when it erupted.
One was the young geologist from the U.S. Geological Survey who allowed his enthusiasm to run away with him to such an extent that he was conducting monitoring in an area very close to the mountain when the eruption took place.
I finally tracked down a copy, poor in quality, and expected mediocrity at best when I put it in.
Unlike a lot of Bergman's depressing work in the 1970s, I felt good about the film when it was over.
lame and not funny, it's amazing this movie did as well as it did when it originally came out.
In this case, janitor Frank Whaley and popular girl Jennifer Connelly accidentally get locked in a department store overnight, and thus have to reassess their lives (especially when some thugs break in).
Jim is lost in his own world and makes up stories, I used to do that a lot when I was younger.
It has many funny and marked scenes as when Jim, with bride clothes and walking of skids sees Josie and falls after that.
The little kids who had been following Frank character around, also say "WOW" when they see her.
However, their plans are interrupted somewhat when a couple of gun wielding thieves break into the store...
Jim is incredulously surprised when Josie identifies him as the town liar.
I think this movie loses what ever it had going for it, when a straight forward plot, which leads to lotsa dead writing, and a film that seems rushed together to make air time.
She is instantly caught off guard when Jim suggests a simple dance, one that he's been dreaming of since the 7th grade.
In a time when movies like Primer and The Man From Earth are showing us that great films can be made on a shoestring budget, Limbo acts as a cautionary tale that small films can still be terrible.
Limbo takes the concept of being trapped in a single hour, and how the lines between right and wrong, good and evil, begin to blur when there are no consequences to ones actions.
Either someone thinks I am very gullible or movie-makers all over the world should think about making church on Sundays a regular practice ... alternatively, they should spare themselves countless hours in AA further down the line (when directors and their movies like this become common practice) and quit now!!
Nowadays stories (when they are not biographic or lifted directly from already successful books) are unimpressive at best.
This is a lot like The Lost Patrol when which not too many are going to make it out alive.
Joel McCrea stars as tough US Cavalry Sergeant Vinson, who has to take command of C Troop when the senior officers are killed during an Apache attack.
McCrea is first rate in the role, never over doing the hard-nosed side of the character and garnering believable sympathy when his guard is down.
I still get goosebumps when I think about it.
except for when the midget gets axed in the mellon or when Arabula(arab-dracula) Shoots that stupid hippy with his ring.
I saw this on TV multiple times when I was little--loved it then.
The camera-work is dreadful and the blood and gore (which looked cool when I was little) is laughably fake now.
The "climatic" battle between Dracula and the monster is a hoot, when you can see it in the poorly lit setting.
You ainât seen Chaney until youâve watched him giddy with anticipation for his âfixâ, or go cold turkey when heâs deprived of it; on top of that, in order to provide Naish with the body parts necessary for his experiments, Chaneyâs character â named Groton (perhaps an amalgam of gross cretin?)
Thanks to "Uncle Forry," I was one of those kids who had lined up to see Dracula VS. FRANKENSTEIN when it first saw theatrical release: the co-stars of this one had turned up on the cover of FAMOUS MONSTERS OF FILMLAND (which had featured an article on the movie without advising those of us who cared about such things that it might be something less than entertaining- on any level).
I found out that FJA was among the Missing when I happened upon the final minute or so of a year-end Farewell to the Lost on Turner Classic Movies.
There weren't a whole lot of things a kid could count on when I was growing up, but there was- and always will be, for as long as life endures- the memories I have of a black and white magazine whose editor shared my love of the Fantastic; an editor who always seemed to me to be a kid at heart.
However, trouble is stirred when Jodie, the sister of a singer, Judith Fontaine, goes missing and Judith attempts to find her with the help of some new friends.
When the credits start, this resembles the old-time Universal monster pictures of the 1930's and 40's, mostly due to the old-fashioned musical score, but when I saw the whole movie as a kid, at about 12 years of age, it did creep me out.
I also had to laugh when Naish describes the obvious lunatic Chaney as harmless to some guests, then sends him to chop people up in the next scene...but we knew that.
It was one of my favorites 30 years ago when I caught it on the tube, and I think it still holds up.
His crazed assistant (as played by Lon Chaney) goes out to collect body parts when he's not standing nearby cuddling his puppy.
One of the body parts he's collected is the head of a girl whose sister is a Las Vegas Lounge Performer (with an awesome hair-do) and of course when sister is missing she has to come look for her.
They then of course, delve into the mystery when not hanging out on the beach doing romantic things.
The cops are already after them, but even more troubles arise when the echo-voiced Count Dracula (Zandor Vorkov) arrives and blackmails the mad doc into resurrecting the Frankenstein monster and giving him the blood of his victims!
Jodie Fontaine (Maria Lease) is wandering around on her own when a big ugly guy called Groton (Lon Chaney Jr. as Lon Chaney) chops her head off with an axe.
Also, the plot is hardly logical, it makes virtually no sense whatsoever as Dracula says Dr. Frankenstein's serum will help him create an army of undead Vampires & some nonsense about the human body being reanimated with a natural substance made when someone is decapitated but what does that matter when a film is this consistently entertaining?
A complication arises when the two fall in love.
There are complications galore when Richard Carlson is determined to find a "plant" if there is one at their college.
Complications arise when Pug (Richard Carlson), a reporter for the Porcupine (the student newspaper), begins to investigate the legitimacy of the contest.
She was quite beautiful and more natural looking--making me wish that more co-eds had looked like this when I was in college.
The movie starts like a sort of mystery/thriller,when Janie pursues the truth about her past.
This is a wonderful movie to make any parent pull their kids tighter, but watch the hands when you hug your teenage daughter!
I can remember a time long ago when MTV actually played videos.
I can actually tell you about the ONLY time I watched it - it was when I was studying the art of film making.
To finish it all with a slash, I had the same unpleasant experience when watched "Caligula".
I would almost hope that I am not alone in this opinion -- to truly 'enjoy' this movie you'd have to be pretty damn callous to hideous imagery, especially when it comes to rape and excessive exploitation of the female body.
Also when Alex is taking his final exam to leave the correctional center you can notice that Kubrick is questioning society's parameters of right and wrong.
The statement made by the Minister of the Interior about the "peace-loving citizens" is a direct reference to the name that Soviet government representatives applied to their people when talking about the Cold War.
His cuts of varying speed and intensity, his long takes when dealing with dialog... truly amazing.
You also can't help but appreciate his interaction with his good old mom and dad as a tiny snicker forms when he insists on not being able to attend school and a sad but sweet look of confusion and sadness innocently appears as his parents introduce him to their replacement son and he finds himself homeless and in need of his droogies.
In DR STRANGELOVE, OR HOW I STOPPED WORRYING AND LEARNED TO LOVE THE BOMB violence as war was discussed, overheard, never truly seen until the final reel when a flurry of atomic bombs exploded into bright mushrooms as the song "We'll Meet Again" lovingly played in the background.
Alex quickly flees the scene once the police sirens reach his shaky ears, but when he gets back to his pal's waiting outside, they return their experiences with him by bashing him over the head with a hard object, allowing their jumbled escape, but his certain demise.
Most film fans in Europe will tell you that they had seen the movie on grainy bootleg videotapes years ago when they were young and curious.
And when one gets down to the core, you can't really explain it.
Too many questions to consider when one watches this film.
Did he return to the States demonstrably different from when he came?
Even when the end is in sight, Jones' evocative, empathetic performance keeps us from being too complacent.
They try to avoid hard drugs, at least when outside of a war zone, but otherwise, jokin' and tokin' is de rigeur.
It's not a question of "if", it's "when".
Plot is quite original for its suggesting war is terrible and wrong, not only because it is unjustified but because it has a corrupting impact on people, especially when they're back and return (try to..) civilization.
I suppose when one thinks of Charlize Theron, you can't help but remember her as a very blonde and very beautiful model.
I won't be surprised that when she wants to be taken seriously in her roles, she either changes her hair style, color, or just tries to make herself fugly (remember Monster?
The chemistry between the two, who start off quite coolly, begin to heat up when they realize that their strength combined would prove to be an asset.
This film is about a veteran taking matters into his own hands when his son, who returned recently from Iraq, disappeared mysteriously.
In particular, he focuses on Hank Deerfield (the Oscar-nominated Tommy Lee Jones, in a role originally meant for Eastwood), a Vietnam veteran whose faith in American values is tested when he learns his youngest son has gone MIA after returning from a tout of duty in the Middle East.
With only the boy's cell phone as a clue, Hank begins to look into the case with the help of a female detective (Charlize Theron) and discovers he might have made the wrong decisions when his son's body is found and his wife (Susan Sarandon) blames him for the death of both their children (the other one was killed in combat).
It's when Hank and local Bradford police Det.
Michael Deerfield was left a mental cripple when he came back from Iraq, like so many of his comrades in arms, but was not given the treatment, by the US military, that he so desperately needed.
Hank despite denying to himself the obvious, from the cell-phone video he observed, was left broken and destroyed together with his wife and Michael's mom Joan, Susan Sarandon, when the truth finally came out.
Don't go when you want an evening of escapist fun.
After four different characters are "fingered" for the murder, one begins to recall old "who-dun-it" films and wonder when Mrs. Marple will be announced.
Finally, when the end did come, like some tooth extraction visit to a low rate dentist, we are inflicted with the image of TLJ raising a flag upside down, and duct taping the lanyard to the staff.
I sense a person utterly detached from history when I read that.
A recent study concluded that the English were, as a group, fairly happy during WWII, even when their nation was under attack.
Jones' character is a veteran of the Vietnam war, and is hardly a delicate flower when it comes to the matters of war and its effect on the psyche.
The story is based on actual events in 2001 in Tennessee, and its title references the mythic tale of David and Goliath set at a time when the rules of engagement were different than the present.
I like the way he kept the camera back at the end of the hallway when Mrs. Deerfield cried into her husband's arms after viewing the mutilated body of her son.
He employed a similar method when she broke down and started crying on the phone (Mr. Deerfield: "I'm not gonna sit on the phone and listen to you cry."
Additionally, Haggis has the actors restrain themselves during the height of when one expects them to indicate the most suffering and when the camera is close enough to expose it, i.e.
Mr. Deerfield seeing his mutilated son for the first time, also towards the end when he realizes that his own rigid personality alienated his son from himself and Cpl.
I am sure this will be a popular film at the Oscars this year, and if they gave out awards for best scene this would be sure to garner a nomination for a simple, poignant, yet profoundly moving scene when Frank tells the story of David and Goliath (which took place in the Valley of Elah) to the little son of detective Sanders.
And that's the theme of this film: what happens when we lose touch with what's painful and don't care any more.
This makes it all so much more worth it when we finally see him smile.
It is the scene when the Okinawa mission goes wrong: the yakuza group from Tokyo is attacked by assassins in a restaurant.
The sumo ring on the beach when they imitate the game made of cardboard.
It seems that almost every moment of violence occurs when the antagonists are within arm's length, even when it is with guns.
The music is another great score of the movie, it is original and perfectly fits the movie atmosphere when it is cast.
The plot shows how human we are all, whatever we do or have done and even when we lately discover the whole value of life.
Something leaves Takeshi disturbed when he and his men notice that the situation isn't as terrible as they were led to believe and that the two supposedly warring factions appear to be barely fighting at all.
I've seen and admired his later movies, including Hana Bi and Dolls, but i wasn't quite sure what to expect when i got the DVD version of this.
Even when in gunbattles, nobody moves, nobody tries to dodge, it is as if everyone simply feels chained to their fate.
The warmth the characters show just makes it more hurtful when they meet such pathetic, low-key ends.
The theme of Sonatine is that those brutal and violent humans return to the time when they were still innocent and free of all the wickedness of the world.
I have read several books on the case so you can't say it wasn't made up when it indeed happened.
Basically Sante flips when her husband does not leave her any money in his will- he leaves it to his children.
Silverman was murdered on 4th of July weekend, when her house-man and maid were off for vacation.
A time when the games were played by athletes, not corporations.
A time when the game was more important than the money.
What the Yankees accomplished that year was legendary and is talked about to this day and cannot be ignored when considering what Mantle and Maris did that year.
At least  when Kevin Costner throws a baseball he looks like a ball player.
His film is full of clichÃ©s : abusive slow motions (on the crucial moments, of course) stupid special effect when we see the ball coming right to us, horrible heavy orchestral muzak (on the crucial moments, of course).
Excellent, excellent work of Billy Crystal as the director of this TV film, which brought me back to the 50-60s when I was still a child.
This film gave you the story of the feat done by the outfielder Roger Maris when in 1961 he broke the former record of 60 homers done by Babe Ruth in 1927.
It is true that when Ruth played each team played 154 games while in 1961 there were already 162, but the fact is that in any league or championship it is a real feat to bat 61 homers, and this is what Maris did.
In one of the final scenes when Maris finally seems to get the support from the fans he deserves, you can almost feel yourself sigh in relief.
I'd like to end with a quote from the movie towards the end, when one of the reporters asks Maris, "do you think you earned their (the fans) respect holding up under all this pressure?"
It's about the underdog, the little guy, the one that's easy to forget when blinded by the limelight.
adrian monk..a detective who is suffering from a very mild obsessive compulsive actions but they develop to a disorder that made him on a medical suspension right after the murder of his wife...the reason that lead monk to such complications is that he is certain that he was the target of the bombing that lead to his wife's death..and guilt distorted his vision that even his genius mind can't concentrate when it comes to his wife's case... monks methods accompanied by his disorder is giving a great flavor to that amazing series..especially that sherlock holmes and Agatha christy made it very hard for others to show us more characters in the world of crimes and mystery...but monk came from nowhere with the help of the talent of tony shalhoub( or should i say mr.monk).. and no doubt that all characters -either guests or permanent- were amazing and participated very helpfully in that work... just to save you time to go and order the whole series i would like to tell you one word that describes this masterpiece.....  FLawLESS
this is a great movie and i think it will be considered a classic the thing that pisses me off is that Marris isn't in the Hall of fame most people who don't know much about him think he only had that one good year when he broke the record but he was the MVP of the 1960 season and he played well throughout most of his career he should be in the hall of fame without a doubt there's four people that aren't in the hall of fame that should be shoeless Joe Jackson isn't there because he threw the world series even though he played excellent and Pete rose should be in there to it doesn't matter what he did off the field its what he did on the field that counts Marris is the next person not in i already explained why but the most shocking person not to be in the hall of fame is frank Robinson what the hell happened there
I imagine the creators knew they were going to have to make some people unhappy when 61 was made.
Fun to watch if you've a son who know nothing of the 1961 chase when this viewer, indeed, remembers being told by adults that Mantle, not Maris, should break the record.
I didn't know this ahead but it was done so credibly that when the end credits said Yankee Stadium had been played by Tiger Stadium I thought "What?
However, the press (and often, it seemed, the fans) were still favouring Mantle, and sometimes booed Maris when he would hit a home run.
Good little touches like Maris' special eggs (which Mantle began to eat with reluctance, but came around when Maris said he hit home runs after eating them), scrap book collections shown periodically throughout the film, the song 'I love Mickey', and other audio-visual pieces of baseball memorabilia make this a baseball trivia-buff treat.
But when I saw the DVD of "61*" at a Family Dollar store, priced at just $6, I took a chance and bought it.
And when Mantle was slowed by injuries, the fans generally ranged from lukewarm to hostile in their treatment of Maris as he neared the record.
This is a sharp contrast to 1998, when McGwire regularly filled stadiums in pursuit of Maris' record even though McGwire's team didn't even make the playoffs that season.
When you own it, it adds four minutes of footage that did not air when it aired back in 2002.
The big TV stations started to crack down on its cartoon specials like Peanuts and Garfield, and the success that the sixties, seventies, and eighties brought it were stopped cold, with only the traditional Christmas special being shown (which I don't think is as good as people claim when compared to some of the other specials).
I am not sure what it was implying, really, but it looks like a desperate attempt to throw in a happy ending when the script has painted them into a corner Melendez couldn't get out of.
The same cannot be said for a goof up at the dance, when you see Franklin in the background, but he has dirt marks all over his head like Pigpen, who makes his own cameo a few moments later.
Many times the cast shouts their lines out when a character should be talking normally; other times a character plainly talks when the animated body movements suggest they should be shouting.
There are over thirty Peanuts specials in existence....so why can't the big stations just show some of the old, rare ones again so we can remember what it was like when the Peanuts were terrific?
Speaking of axe technique, when a guy fell down a slope, instead of using the appropriate technique of rolling over and gently applying the point as a brake by applying ones weight, he lies on his back flailing helplessly at the snow.
Hans Christian Schmid's "23" presents a not too far away time, when it was possible, that some amateurs could break into the world's most important computer systems.
Originally, it was the other actress that was being thought of to be cast in this, but when Hitch's folks saw Shirley, she won the part.
Â He looked exactly the same when he was alive, only he was vertical.
I saw this when it first came out and by the end of the first reel I expected there would be some sort of wry humor would emerge out of it but no, it just went on and on, and got sillier with every scene.
I always wondered why Paramount didn't stop production when they saw the final script and I can imagine it would now be just an embarrassment for the entire cast.
In other words Hitchcock is questioning us on the real value of life when death is no longer a crime.
All the subtlety and detail imbued in this screenplay matters little when it is lost in tentative and banal acting.
Comedy is particularly satisfying when it deals with the shortcomings of human nature, not when it denies natural emotions and intellect as this story does so inexcusably.
This explains why she behaves so strangely when she meets Gwen with Harry's body.
Maclanes behavior when seeing Harry (her 'no good husband') dead, and right in front of her son, makes you wonder about her too.
Sadly, this is a film that's overlooked when you think of his other films, like the ones I mentioned above.
I think it's a relaxing film, especially when you see the great photography that captures the beauty of autumn in New England.
I have to chuckle when I read some of the over-the-top raves this film has gotten from supposedly American viewers.
The Trouble With Harry will only work for you if you're a fan of:  A) British drawing room humor B) French slapstick/farce C) Hitchcock's --- and a rabid one --- who vehemently believe he never failed at anything  This is one of the rare instances when the studio idiots were actually right when they told Hitchcock not to embark on this project.
First of all, only Hitchcock would come out with something that could be termed a "light comedy" when the central figure in the film from beginning to end is a dead body, but a lot of Hitchcock's standard themes are very prevalent in the film, even though it differs so much from his traditional style.
Old spinster Miss Gravely (Mildred Natwick) fears that when she whacked the man over the head with her shoe, she may have done more damage than she intended.
I never knew the film was a comedy before I began watching, so you can imagine my surprise when one innocent character after the next stumbled upon a brutally murdered corpse and react in the very least expected ways possible.
It was almost as surpring, however, when I read the comments on IMDb and realized that a large portion of Hitchcock's audience simply didn't "get it".
So you turn into an obsessive and murderous psychopath when your wife commits suicide?
It's the kind of movie of which you just know in advance how each scene is going to end and how's going to live or die and how and when.
He sees her and then he has to go back to his mother's house when Jane is caught in the fur freezer vault.
It's just too bad more people didn't appreciate Bobby Van when he was around.
One day he is carrying a chandelier down a street when, unexpectedly, a naked man falls out of the sky and lands on him.
Guy Warrington had been in bed with his lover Helga ( Elke Sommer ) when her husband came home early, and in his panic he jumped out of the window, forgetting she lived in a high-rise apartment.
talk-show - he walks out in disgust when the producer ( Angus Mackay ) keeps bleeping out the word 'penis'!
However, the movie does provide a very powerful picture of what it is like when you get pregnant and don't want to.
This is a heart wrenching movie that examines the paths that separate women throughout the years (1950's to present) take when faced with an unexpected pregnancy.
How even when it is illegal it still happens.
"Win Ben Stein's Money" was one of the best shows that aired on Comedy Central when "South Park" and "The Daily Show" were rather new.
The show did suffer a bit when Nancy Pimental took over as co-host, as she lacked Jimmy's chemistry (he later went on to co-host the insipid "Man Show"), but she was fairly competent as a comedian.
Hey TCM UK, when are you going to show more silent classics like you do on the other side of the pond?
It details what happens when three women of varying ages are suddenly forced to face the difficult and very personal choices that must be made concerning their unplanned pregnancies.
This film shows up as well now as I did when I first saw it in 1996 and was amazed.
Anne Heche's role in the final story was the most 'typical' of the three: the single college student who must struggle with her own moral and personal issues when making a choice about her pregnancy.
I don't know when it will be on again, right now its not scheduled anytime soon, but definitely watch it with someone you love!
I remember watching this on the Family Channel (yes, the family channel) a long time ago when I was little.
I've seen the miniseries at least five times since then, when it's be re-run on various cable channels.
I liked Dennis Weaver's performance better now than in the 70s when "McCloud" was fresh in my mind, because his character was not that likable.
The second is the relationship between Navy Junior Grade Lieutenant Douglas North (Gregg Henry in his most memorable performance) and his family, headed by his Navy Commander father (Richard Anderson, who plays about the only officer in the film whose head stays on straight throughout), along with a local Japanese news writer with whom Doug went to school in Oahu, Holly Nagata (Tiana Alexandra, who if I read her IMDb biography right, was all of 16 when this film was made).
Tora!, with new dubbing in both Japanese and English; some of the English dubbing is unintentionally humorous over some post-attack scenes involving attack leader Mitsuo Fuchida and his crew chief, and officers aboard the carrier Soryu when the fleet's recall order goes out - given what these men actually say (via Tora's captions) the new dubbing mixes things up a little.
The film gets some details wrong - when Nagumo gets word that the first wave has sunk numerous US ships, he orders the launching of the second wave; in fact the second wave took off an hour before the first wave made contact with their targets.
The film also gets wrong the exact time the first wave broke off its attack and also shows torpedo planes in the second wave, when only the first wave had such.
The North family also gets a great scenery-chomping scene between Commander North, Ellie, and their daughter Patricia at their hotel early in the attack amid rumors that President Roosevelt has surrendered Oahu to the enemy; Patricia and Ellie are hysterical as Michael struggles to keep them calm, and when Patricia asks her mother if she's ever been raped (wanting to know whether to resist should the Japanese invade the island) the stunned silence by Ellie and Commander North is strikingly effective.
On the other hand,the new Paige has no personality at all.She has nothing for the audience.I don't feel sorry for her at all when she's struggling in this relationship cause I don't even think they're in love,even just a little bit.Persuading the audience is one of the essential parts of acting!!!!!!
The script was predictable, the actors weren't stretched by any means and, sadly, when needed most of all, Paige was a dud.
Where is John Landis when you need him?
The only returning character is the guy playing King Edvard - everybody else ran a mile when they saw the scripts for this, what a joke and a bad one at that.
why is the father alive and well when he was dying in the first movie which is why the prince couldn't have a normal life and had to come home to save the monarchy.
It really is abysmal when you get morons making a sequel (and heaven forbid a third instalment, this time the actor playing Edvard has gone and is played by someone else again) which they proceed to ruin completely.
I had seen the first movie some months ago and loved it, so when I saw the sequel came out, I couldn't wait to see it!
I just don't see what is the point of bringing out a second one when 1. the ending of he firsts one was fine like is or try more harder to make a sequel when you can get actually find the time to get the original people back and make it done right.
Sometimes I ask myself why do I watch any given movie which has had bad reviews, and if I should begin to listen to the critics (especially when the opinion is unanimous).
I feel sorry for the writer...i think she was high when she wrote it.
then when with this movie's opening scene, the girl came out with Wig & heavy make-up with horrible eye-shadows !!!
and since when all this drama's story based on power game and politics ?
I don't know if the writer researched Denmark or Norway and Sweeden when finding names, but names like Rosalind and Edward are very rare, and not exactly typical royal names.
But when an old childhood royal friend, Kirsten, gets in the way of the relationship believing that it should only be royalty who becomes king and queen... you can take off with the rest of the plot.
And the queen wasn't mean enough when Paige screwed up as she did in the first movie.
This noble just happens to have a daughter, Kirstin, who was a playmate of Edvard's when they were younger.
Dear me, I think I was not very happy when I saw this sequel!
I was so excited when I heard that the movie was coming out.
Heather Graham gives a carefully nuanced performance that should serve to remind people she can be a great actress when working with solid material and a skilled director.
There's a raw, leave-nothing-to-the-imagination sex scene between Graham and a certain character (trying not to divulge any serious spoilers here) that is not only surprising (given how, when Graham shot it, there were very high hopes for her ABC sitcom and for her becoming a network prime time queen), but cathartic and wholly satisfying in terms of character arc.
It is shocking and unexpected when it comes, but makes perfect sense when you realize the film has been building up to it.
One day Simon comes across this lady sitting in the park and becomes infatuated with her multi-colored, or rainbow, scarf.The lady in question Rose Phipps, Heather Graham, becomes very agitated, and even frightened, when Simon mails a number of photos he took of her at her brownstone.
Tommaso Pensara (Dominic Chianese) is an elderly painter and music lover who lives alone and supports himself by being the 'mail boy' in a large firm: his loneliness is heightened when he discovers he has macular degeneration and will go blind.
The threads of coincidence begin to tie these people together when Simon begins to photograph Rose in a manner that resembles stalking, when Tommaso notices and desires and older lady at his workplace, Isabel Parades (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) and is encouraged by Dr Rose to share his potential blindness with this friend, and when Rose explores the attention Simon bestows on her, filling an emotional need for both parties.
Saw this movie after the hype surrounding the many nude scenes present in the movie.The actors and some emotion looked real but then when it came to acting it out, they weren't professional enough.
It's a face that is unique to that person, one that you will never get to know probably, but when you take a glance of in the subway or the bus or the sidewalk, you know somehow you relate to them, somehow you know there's a story behind them.
letting us simply be the judge of him if we are judgmental, the observer if we are observant, the aloof bystander if we are one, and most likely we're a little bit of every one of those types when watching this film.
It's not that you can see the actress' head tracking the camera and then relaxing when it landed on her, or the splicing of the edit in the bell ringing scene, or the totally scuzzy texture and manipulatively depressing guiding hand of the story and of its director.
The comments here by Spanish speakers that the acting was just atrocious made me realize how much can be forgiven when you don't speak the language of the film, but even I cringed at some of the performances.
Most aren't familiar with the Manuel Romasanta story (no reason why they should) and when they see the DVD case (I'm not familiar with theatrical hype), they are quite justified in picking it up expecting a werewolf film.
I enjoyed this movie but I think I enjoyed because when I learned it was coming, and being the curious person I am, I dug into the story of Manuel Romasanta.
And when someone throws your reality at your face, you can hate it.
I consider that one of the main achievements of this movies is to show many cultural traits of my country:   -The view of the Catholic religion as a resource to erase the mistakes one has made: "you can do whatever you want, don't worry about the effects because God will always help you"   -The notorious gap between rich and poor people: when Ana refers to Jaime's servant as "la gata" in such a despective -but common- way.
It's pretty bad when the most professional acting performance in a movie is delivered by a little girl (Danielle Brisebois).
Now let me tell you why this is an important, groundbreaking and momentous moment in film history: pivotal scenes were filmed at CAZENOVIA COLLEGE in lovely, tiny little Cazenovia NY in the snowy winter of 1978 when I and my classmates were tapped to be extras in the "college scenes"!
OK, so the movie was a little on the sappy side, the song was on the radio sung by the incomparable Roberta Flack and we got to attend a Premier Screening in Syracuse when it opened.
George Fawcett's character, Zeke, provides some of the story transitions by being around when the transitions occur.
I first saw this movie when it came out in theaters in 1978.
Especially when Joe starts to sing.
Somewhere out there, cats start to howl when Joe sings.
A favorable impression is made by Paolo Bonacelli, who appears as the mayor Luigi Magalone, who even when censoring Levi showed a lot of respect for him.
Quite contrary, just when I became intrigued by Romasanta, he is swept away and the movie ends.
However when you read Christ stopped at Eboli and Yaban what strikes you first is the patterns of similarity in peasant life and experience of the intellectuals visiting these places.
However, when a producer can't be bothered to get the details right, it's hard to go away feeling anything less than cheated.
If you have kids it is pretty much a guarantee that you'll be asked to go see this movie or buy it when the DVD is released.
Oh for the days when animated movies could be enjoyed by the whole family.
Perhaps this is the beginning of when computer animated movies will suffer all the bad points of regular (children's) comedies.
Whatever it was that they were taking when they came up with Bee Movie, I suggest you have some before watching; it'll make the experience less painful.
And when I heard that he was prepping his own animated film to basically follow it up with, I was a little worried.
I appreciated it, and I know the people around me did, but when we are the only ones laughing in a room full of screaming five-year-olds, I think there may be an issue content-wise.
Even when the character ends up clearly being him, he manages to use his voice to project a certain finesse and gravitas that not a lot of big name actors can do when they do voice-work.
They look good, but when it comes down to precise and meticulous details (such as in the brilliantly detailed Ratatouille), they just do not have them.
it reminded me of when we were kids and each kid will add a new line to the story.
Just like the efficient worker bees in Bee Movie, this is what happens when everyone does their role right: the cast, the director, the writers, editors, the animators, etc.
Jerry Seinfeld isn't really known for being anything BUT Jerry Seinfeld,so when I first became aware of this movie(sometime in early summer of 2005,and they were doing preview trailers BACK THEN!
Seinfeld is BArry B.Benson,a seemingly average young bee who graduates schooling and is readying to go into the hive workforce when it occurs to him that he might want more out of his life than being an average worker bee.
next time when you see a movie about bees and humans.
Handsome production and great photography help the flick which doesn't produce the goods in werewolf transformations, instead opting for being a historical document on a serial killer stating on record he is a werewolf who can not help but kill when the beast comes out to play.
I was waiting (along with 40 easily bored children, who didn't get the Pomp & Circumstance joke when I did, to my embarrassment) for some drama to cut in, rather like the revenge or rescue plots of the Toy Stories.
For example, when Ken (Warburton again) screams and rants, his face does not match the explosion of rage.
It is hard for me to find much fault when I am laughing that much.
I'm a sucker for werewolf movies and when I saw the DVD cover of Werewolf Hunter; that and its' title had me picking it up ASAP!
Just when you think movies can't get any worse, you see Sex Monster (or, as it should be called, "I Became A Bisexual Sex Freak In Order To Obey My Husband").
Mike Binder is a decent enough actor, but when it comes to writing and producing his own material, he seems to only be able to fixate on one, really weak Sex-farce situation.
I highly recommend this genuinely funny sex farce involving the  mishaps that occur when a man talks his wife into having lesbian  relationships.
He goads her semi-seriously and when she finally shows some interest, he convinces her to invite over a girl from work who has been coming on to her.
He was at his best when he was being tormented by Laura's obsession as he tried desperately to get the sex genie back in the bottle.
When their flights get canceled is when their journey starts.
My favorite was when Fred went to see his wife, she nonchalantly asked for a divorce.
He seemed to focus on telling a story about what happens to these people when they return home.
But groundless were all my fears, for as the movie progresses it becomes increasingly clear that this is not your usual, run-of-the-mill type of werewolf crap, with Romasanta assuming the form of a proper wolf when he transforms.
Some highlights: A furious McAdams throws her soda on Pena when he insults her boyfriend, killed in Iraq, by saying he was unfit to be a soldier because he supposedly did armed robbery.
McAdams lashes out in a bar when some valley girl-types mock her limp.
Some of the funnier scenes occur when Colee tries to get him help for his (hopefully temporary) ED.
These strangers are brought together when JFK Airport is shut down indefinitely.
It's always a good sign when a movie ends and you wish you could get to see more of the characters, and it's an all too rare occurrence in modern cinema.
One of the things that really surprised me is that when a little romance starts to bloom between Pena and McAdams, I didn't roll my eyes like I would have expected but instead I smiled and enjoyed watching this flirtation grow between the two of them in a non-typical way.
One scene in particular, when she finally meets the family of her fallen friend, is a showcase for what an extraordinary actress she is.
I was 13 when this played on TV.
when we did the series .. (people flew in from all over the world to try to get on the show) .. we shot two shows a day every other day for a total of 24 episodes OR 12 days of shooting .
I was fortunate enough to see the film when it played at the Sunset 5 at midnight.
In my opinion, when you see this at a video store near you, it's worth picking up.
The music was very good, and the drawings are well drawn, especially when they are made with the hand.
Its a very good film that I'll have to watch when I feel up to it.
I don't think they'd understand some of what happens, especially when most of them don't understand how serious cartoons can be.
It's set in Hong Kong, and that's often a plus when it comes to fighting movies.
And as mentioned, Norris fails on every level in this movie when it comes to that.
I loved Pinky and the Brain and watched the show almost religiously, but when some dunderhead at the WB decided to pair these mice with Elmyra, I was horrified.
), he goes about collecting information, so when he gets down to business he takes out the right men.
It happened in the mid-nineteenth century, when a string of violent deaths took place which seemed in some ways like animal attacks, and in others like cold and calculated murder.
And when Kristen, her father, and other magical creatures begin the Christmas season with the reading of the naughty and nice list things don't go well.
I've been a fan of John Dye, since his performance in Touched By An Angel on TV and when Once Upon A Christmas first premiered on family channel it looked like a charming Christmas movie.
I still get goose bumps when I hear the wonderful duet "It Might Have Been" and the song with the lyric "every man shall be my brother" Unfortunately my copy is getting a bit worn and I would like to secure another copy.
Please let me know when and how a DVD or download of the original B&W live action production of "The Stingiest Man in Town" becomes available.
Perhaps the commenter meant "Flemings" when he said "Dutch" (I know nothing about any such collaboration: I'm not making an accusation).
There are some very funny moments involving the vigil for the "deceased" mayor (especially when the court midget blackmails him).
Set in early 17th-century Flanders, which had previously been under Spanish rule, the story opens with shots of a busy village preparing for the yearly carnival, when the news break that the Spanish Duke Olivares and his troops plan to stay in town.
And he does make this statement when he portrays these poor Palestinian Arabs as the Noble Oppressed and the Israeli army as the Faceless Evil.
(Was he really sad when he stood over Arna's lifeless body?
The film brings home the detrimental aspects of how one often reaps what they sow when using violence and oppressive force to solve problems.
I think this movie works at the beginning as a giallo, and at the end backwards as a vigilante movie, when we realize what the whole thing was about.
I guess when this was made the director, Antonio Bido, was making a rather valiant attempt to follow in Dario Argento's footsteps.
This movie takes place in the early 14th century when the Spanish Inquisition was at it's peak.
A bald headed man that plays the part of a priest tries citizens of all kinds of wrongdoing against the Bible when he himself is not so innocent.
Which is all that counts when it comes right down to it.
Watch for Eric Roberts' sneaker/tux combo when he and his team first enter the hotel.
The quality in the film only continues to decrease, inexplicable decisions from the bad guy, good guy and a concerned looking Madsen (just watch his face when 3 S.W.A.T.
The Flamethrower Bit - Out of nowhere the main bad guy produces a flamethrower, and just when you think you might get to see Eric Roberts in flames, it produces a measly flame which reaches about 2 feet, not exactly ideal with Roberts at the other end of a 30 foot (at least) corridor.
Looking like a ventriloquist's dummy with a bad wig (even better when you've seen the guy we're supposed to believe it is), it sort of hits the ground and crumples, and for the few bittersweet moments we see the dummy on the floor it looks more like a pile of clothes and hair than anything in the rough shape of a human, bones completely broken or not.
After all it had a good premise, fake kidnapping of the President goes bad when someone decides to make it real.
but the worst scene was when the attackers moved in a small room and the special forces attacked them by entering the room firing rapidly with their m16s and some how they did not hit anyone then the attackers used a smoke grenade to push the special forces outside the small room.
I was surprised when they used the ultimate tom and jerry prank were the good guy literally pulled the carpet from underneath the bad guy sending him into a magnificent somersault in the air.
First of all, graphics and music are fine, but unless they're awful, I hardly care about these when I'm playing a game.
I played this game when it first came out to the UK in 2005, and rented it from a local movie store.
Another memorable horror movie straight from master Stuart Gordon.The characters are cool,the acting is really good.Features a nice amount of blood and torture and a little bit of nudity.I love especially the sequence when one guy is cut in half by a huge pendulum.Great music score too and Rona de Ricci,who plays Maria is a beautiful woman.To sum up,this film is not scary at all,but absolutely worth watching.
i got it and when i put it in and it was beautiful the graphics were amazing and searching for the colossus was awesome also the environment was really interactive which was cool the game play was unique and fun and the battles and how you had to find out how to kill them were awesome also the story was the best each colossi was unique and different to kill and the story was a shocker (if you have played Ico then you might have guessed that this game is Ico prequel) this game really pushed the play stations limits though the game is short but it is unforgettable if you have never played this get it and if you have any doubts don't classic 10/10
Like I said add some more elements in the valley and this would be really great, because for the most part when searching for the colossi you are simply riding your horse here and there.
There was even a time when I HAD to stop while entering a canyon with stormy clouds above.
There are times when all you do is ride for about ten to fifteen minutes, just trying to get to one place.
A baker and his wife end up on the wrong side of the law -- his law -- when they protest an execution and she is accused of witchcraft.
Slamming their headphones when they find out they screwed up only made me laugh.
I like but don't love crossword puzzles (my mother did the double crostics when I was a kid, which were beyond me) and can take them or leave them, but Will Shortz is a gem and the theme of competition is universal.
Nothing, obviously, and it wasn't necessary but when have Liberal filmmakers ever exercised good judgment?
Just let the film's character's set root however, and an entirely human element comes into the staunch equation, much like the words that render themselves visible only when filling in others around it for these dictionary junkies.
Did anyone else feel bad for Will Shortz & Merl Reagle - if they're designing all the puzzles and running the tournament, when do they get to play?
I was most surprised when Merl Reagle wrote in the answers to the theme and found words to fill in (I had always thought that impossible).
What is surprising is the sportsmanship involved when there is an apparent major scoring error in the semi-finals.
The Grand Inquisitor, Torquemada(Lance Henriksen), known for his public executions and torturous methods of those he and his foot-soldiers deem heretics and witches, is overcome with lust when he gazes upon the naked body of baker Antonio's(Jonathan Fuller)lovely wife Maria(the stunning beauty Rona De Ricci)on trial for being a witch after halting the never-ending whipping of a boy child in front of a crowd of people.
Frances Bay steals every scene she's in as accused and imprisoned witch Esmeralda, who befriends Maria and gets revenge on hecklers and executioners when she's set at the the stake to burn with the use of gunpowder.
Mark Margolis ably portrays the abused torturer Mendoza, a puppet Torquemada(..and his goons)uses to do his dirty work(..he has these nasty Christ-like wounds on his hands which Torquemada gave to him as punishment as a reminder of what can happen when you "sin").
The film is rated PG, and the only mildly "offensive" language occurs when one of the puzzle constructors lists several clinical terms that he is not allowed to use in the puzzles.
It never leaves you bored wondering okay when will this over.
Jon Stewart is also funny in the way he deals with clues and how he blames Will Shortz when he doesn't get them.
There is a funny moment when Ellen Ripstein, a former winner, tells us that in spite of having won, she keeps going every year to participate in the tournament.
Some of Mr. Shortz observations are funny, especially when he shares his typical weekly correspondence from frustrated people that are "puzzled" by his clues.
One night, Kyle and Hunter are tracking an outlaw when the dog runs ahead of his partner.
Also, when the dog himself is on the screen or his friends, animal lovers will be happy as well.
On the box this movie claims to be better than or comparable to tiles such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and Phantasm when in fact it is a terrible piece of garbage.
Especially with friends on a rainy night, when you have nothing else to do.
And she is completely remorseless when her married "lover's" wife finds out about their relationship.
And she completely ignores the obvious meaning when he not only doesn't leave his wife, but virtually cuts off all contact with her.
She even misses the import of her Swiss boyfriend deciding to work all day when she comes to visit him in Switzerland.
There should be a warning before every showing of this film that you will experience deep anger, regret, fury, malice and a strong desire to harm the nearest person to you when you finish viewing this film.
Everyone has their own rating system when it comes to movies.
One interesting fact that I wasn't aware of when I watched this film is that it was originally set to be made in the 80's, with the legendary John Cassavetes directing.
Harry Dean Stanton is delightful as always when he appears in such cameo parts.
Good flick from back in the days when Full Moon Entertainment was serious about making them.
Sean Penn is sent to jail for a number of years and when he is released he returns to his love Robin Wright Penn.
Well if your idea of a comedy is watching a woman get drunk, get beat up, almost raped, live with a psychopath, turn him in to protect him from himself and others, give birth to their child alone, re-marry a guy who's filled with as much rage as the 1st hubby, and then, when the 1st hubby returns, leaves her 3 kids and 2nd hubby without so much as a "I'm gonna miss you" - then this is your kinda a comedy.
If I had known this was an edgy drama I would have been better prepared to properly judge this movie, but I kept wondering when was it going to get funny, even if only in a black comedy kind-of-way, like War of the Roses.
(Oh, and it was so endearing when the 9 year old gave the adults permission to swear because after all she has heard worse.)
What really gets me is that all the reviews described this movie like this: Hip Comedy about a woman who remarries after her 1st hubby goes to jail, and then 10 years later when he is released must choose between the 2.
I saw this one on TV on a weekend, when I was cleaning house and had the tube on, and it started, and I watched a few minutes of it, and I thought, OK, I want to see what happens to this wretch of a girl.
I liked the way they went up to the restaurant when it was pouring down rain and just asked for food... that was pretty cool...seemed old fashioned.
Then comes the day when he gets let out and here is where the film actually struck a raw nerve with me.
When I can't recognize the characters as real human beings, that's when I have a major problem with the film.
The defining moment in this film is when Eddie and Mo reunite.
(Hint: Watch Penn's face when he is asking his tired, pregnant wife to put on heels and a nice dress for going out.
Is this movie really about true love or about something mistaken for it, an obsessive attachment, almost an animal bonding where the two of them need each other, even when it's bad for them.
Blame the drugs, blame the bad brain chemistry, blame the poverty, they do cling together when they shouldn't.
He decides whether "witches" are guilty or not and when they'll be burned for the eyes of God.
All I could think about during the "early days" part of the film was how terrible some children must have it when they are born to mentally and emotionally unstable parents.
She seems to be alone in the town with a whole lot of dead bodies when Heck Williams comes staggering along.
He knows that when he is condemned to die that it was useless to protest.
the main character was sleeping off a drunk in the jail house when the indians attack and left him the sole survivor.
From the beginning of the film, when Jeff Morrow arrives in a town where everyone is dead until the end, Copper Sky piques the interest more than a low-budget Western normally does.
They all just walked to work at the Bon Soir, when they played that room.
And when they find a co-diner at the restaurant dead in their backyard, things become stranger yet.
The plot -- a couple move into a building where a murderer lives -- was more entertaining when the Three Stooges did it.
By the way, the first scene is very grisly and cold-blooded, and you *know* it's gonna be a great movie when that happens even before the opening credits.
You try to fight back when they tear your clothes off to 'examine' you?
She's wonderful, and one of the best and most memorable scenes of this, or any horror movie for that matter, involves her show-stopping revenge when she's burned at the stake.
I saw this for the first time when I was six or seven, and the memory of it really stuck with me, since we didn't have too many TV programs in Romania, back then.
Weirdley, Courtney Cox's face didn't ring a bell years later, when I got to see "Friends".
I saw it six or seven times I think, there were years when mini-series were 'en vogue', but thinking of it now, I imagine it was pretty melodramatic.
It is a dank, rather terrifying unspecified region of France, in a future when food is scarce and vegetarians reside below the surface like rats.
Despite being a very dark subject, this cannibal fantasy is actually quite funny and charming (that is, apart from when they are hacking the unsuspected into cutlets).
The reason is pretty much the same as when I went to Prado and afterward visited Reina Sofia.
It was very hard for me when I found myself in front of Miro's painting that is called "Sin titulo" (no name).
Pardon the irrationality of this review, but I get excited even when writing of it.
And I love the 2 leads, Julie and Louison, especially when they played music together.
This builds atmosphere impeccably well, and is rather exciting when it goes for that.
It's a pity Jeunet and Caro sought to top their efforts when they made "The City of Lost Children" five years later.
Even the butcher is allowed a moment or two when he is neither a joke nor a threat but a human being, one who finds he regrets the life he now leads but is not persuaded to abandon it.
It was worth looking at the movie just to see the scene when Billy Crystal pretends to be a gangster--I could not stop laughing.
I was really shocked when I have seen this movie.
European movies are so interesting and rich in comparison with US films, and I don't get how is possible that people still watch low quality stuff, when there are masterworks like this one.
Their efforts were crowned in 1991, when they were finally able to take their craft to a full feature length film, in the project that would become their breakthrough in the film industry and the proper beginning of their careers as filmmakers: the post-apocalyptic comedy "Delicatessen".
There are some truly great set pieces in the film particularly when the whole house starts to get into the same rhythm as the love makers on the top floor ( ripped off by an American Beer company I note in an advert ) and the botched suicide attempt too - hey I said it is darkly amusing!!
But you won't really care when you see it, because even though the story isn't really elaborate, what you have here is one of the most original movies you'll ever get your eyes on.
I mean, we don't really want to know why Paul Vitti (De Niro) has so much problems and when we finally got to know it, we don't feel better.
The story really gets going when an ex-clown turns up at the shop, wanting the handyman's job, which has...become available.
The plot thickens when the new handyman meets, and later falls in love with, the butcher's daughter; Julie.
(that is set off when the butcher tells it that "life is wonderful", no less).
The way that the film looks is also wonderfully different; Delicatessen has a yellow hue, which lends it a style that is very dull and dreary; and that does the film no end of favours when you consider it's core subject material.
I should have known better when I saw rubber suited creature on the cover box but I gambled...
And I cried when I heard he had passed away--long live Doug on the screen!
Brill film for youngsters, I loved the film as a kid, first saw it on bbc 1 or 2 in about 1985 when I was 8.
However, the final redemption went also to the Isabellas as well, when the father killed his son-in-law.
I realize that Patrick Swayze isn't the best actor in the world but when you see a movie with Liam Neeson and Ben Stiller you'd expect that it wouldn't suck... you'd be wrong.
Neeson's portrayal of your average ass-kicking coal miner from Kentucky is all the more awesome when you figure in the fact that the dude is Irish.
I remember seeing this film when I was 13 or so.
Years later when I discovered that Liam was british my opinion of his acting abilities skyrocketed.
In print it doesn't sound like much but when he delivers it, this quote is truly amazing.  
What were these people thinking when they agreed to be in this stinker?
There's tons of big names in this film from when they were very young.
I thought the oriental take on the vampire theme was interesting and had hopes that there would be some chilling moments, but when even the undead are flying through the air throwing kicks, it's just cheesy.
Hong Kong humor is usually quite different than American humor...I'm sure a lot of people missed when RAIN, CLOUD, THUNDER, and LIGHTNING (ridiculously stereotypical "hero" names) were renamed "Kung," "Hei," "Fat," and "Choi."
The scene when the father is stuck "in" the reporter... it was so over the top and insane and funny, that I think I just peed my pants.
I sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f***ing start!
I watched this movie and I gotta tell you..It is not that disturbing when you finally realize that things can get better even for a messed up family like the one in this movie.
DeNiro seems to be most at home comedically when he is spoofing his own intense, inarticulate image.
I think I just sold the film to many of you, but I meant it when i said this stinks.
Believe me, you won't be thinking it's "Cool" when someone is sawing YOUR skull in half!
This is where Miike fails in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure.
She's also into heroin, but then later when something happens particular-like with Q, another unnerving revelation is revealed, one without really any explanation for being there.
Take when the father decides to suddenly jump into his 'reality-TV' time by taping when the bullies shoot fireworks at their house.
Or when things start getting particularly disturbing (necrophilia, yeah) and the juxtaposition of father to mother in these scenes is extraordinary in deranged comic timing.
One that really sticks out is when DeNiro consults Crystal in the middle of the night because he couldn't...get it up.
The only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son's tormentors.
Heck, when the movie starts out you think they are all different stories, then, slowly you start to realize that this people are all related and living in the same house hold.
He is almost emotionless...though he will let the family members know when they are doing something wrong by banging it into their head.
At the same time, just like when you watch a film by Lynch or Cronenberg...you know there's some deep commentary on the human condition in there somewhere.
What astonished me when I saw that movie, is the amount of humor (noir)that grows up during the film.
among all the scenes -- of which there are many many memorable ones believe me -- the one which has the key to the movie is when the father is frantically taping the attack on his house and speaking at the same time and among a frenzy of "reporter-talk" he says,   "what are we supposed to feel?"
The best part and one of the most hilarious scenes in cinema has to be when Crystal must pose as a mobster and gives a speech at a meeting with all the five families present.
He played the character of Osgood Fielding III, the older wealthy gentleman that was pursuing Jack Lemmon when he was in drag!
Since this child abuse started when Judy was in her early teens, and since the U.S. government ALWAYS has applied censorship and kiddie porn laws RETROACTIVELY, the availability of Louie's exploitation films all over the internet (and even in the local "Family Video" store) makes a mockery of the American penal code.
In her near-unconscious state she has what should be a disturbing encounter with Max - a DJ/producer with a sensitive heart even though he'd sleep with a woman when she's passed out.
I saw the Wizard of Oz (1939) on TV when I was a kid.
I loved it when Judy Garland paired up with Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire.
The saddest part for me was when she got fired from Annie Get Your Gun.
The film that had all the right elements going for it, proved to be one of the things that broke her spirit, at a time when she needed all she could to make it big, after having left MGM.
In the process she slowly began to lose her sense of self, succumbing to studio entreaties (and when that failed, threats did the job).
Until the fatal end Judy Garland wasn't simply a survivor, she was a hugely talented and ambitious woman who, like water, carved out a new course when an earlier one was blocked.
These generally involve his criminal peers although his donation of his share of the drug rip-off loot to a friend as an investment in the latter's computer business only backfires when the treacherous fellow blackmails Joe.
Whatever the reason, when you name your leading character "Meaney", portray virtually all the characters in a realistic style and then have the main character turn into a tree, then you've got a melange that sinks under the woven strands of too many stylistic ideas.
the look when he sees the dailies.)
Most of the time when movies are transferred from film/digital to DVD, the bottom line is to do it as cheaply as one can.
Good performances don't make it when they are serving a poor story in a technically flawed movie.
This really was a strange little Movie.The Musicians in particular had a great time playing (or miming as happens in Film) up on "Sally Gap" in Wicklow in Ireland in November where it was at least 8 degrees below and the cast and crew were up there for 12 hours at the wedding scene.It really was freezing.I played Bodhran (Irish Drum) and i had to put my hand in hot water because it was frozen to the stick which plays the instrument.But for the fun value we had making that movie deserves 9/10.We filmed the pub scenes in Ardmore Studios which was a much warmer affair.Maybe i'm wrong but i seem to remember a day being taken off when Malosovich was captured due to Goran our Director being an immigrant Serb.
***imminent spoiler ahead*** Finally, when that doomsday arrives - oops?
One of them just finds out that he's going to be a father when a call comes in and he and his friend have to answer it.
(colin welland, who plays willie,in an interview at the time said that the play challenged the actors as well).it could have foundered instead it draws you in until you only see children.children who are by turns nasty,nice,scared,brave,stupid, clever,bloodthirsty and imaginative.one of the best scenes remains when three of the children play mums and dads-adults playing children playing adults-pure genius.
This movie was one of the best straight to video's All in all the acting wasn't that bad It has Kinda Known Actor's And Noreaga a Known Rapper The Storyline Is what keeps you into it.Six Convicts Find A Gold Medallion in the sand out in the desert.The Come Across Danny Trejo Who Gives them A Choice to Either Go Find The Gold Or To The Mexican Border To Freedom,Of Course They Try To Go For The Gold And Thats when the fun starts.The Chicks in the movie are hot The Death's Are Awesome What more is there to ask for in a horror movie Don't Be Fooled by the 1.8 Rating IMDb is giving it If you see this on a shelf at Blockbuster Pick it up and give it a watch for yourself,
Rapper NORE plays a decent part as a convict, who looses his head when chased him down off horseback with a cavalry saber!
Opens a little slow, but picks up momentum when the convicts get to town, with some good chase scenes and stylized fight scenes choreographed by Hong Kong action director Tony Hueng.
A shame this is so bad really, because I like bad horror movies and actually rather liked the basic premise: Back when the Spanish were being generally unpleasant to natives in America, they enslaved the local populace and got them to mine all the gold out of the mountains and basically ended up with a wet dream's worth of gold.
They bimble across the desert looking for the Mexican border, finding en route a mummified body buried in a dry river bed with a gold medallion on it; when they later find a mysterious Indian (the always reliable, although poorly cast in this case Danny Trejo) who spots the medallion, he tells them the legend.
Now when they got to where the gold was buried, there was a wild west style town there, complete with an evil sheriff (Billy Drago!
The convicts are enjoying the bar when the inhabitants turn into undead (terrible effects, ghouls look just like normal people, just with some blue eyeliner, right?)
The weird thing is that since things went belly-up in the cat house when the ghouls revealed what they were, the entire population of the town apart from the Sheriff has vanished.
Fast forward to present day which has 6 convicts escaping when their transport crashes in the same aforementioned desert.
That point being when all the illogical nonsense going on got so high that I didn't know what the hell was going on, much less cared.
Maybe I'm being a touch harsh on it as I've seen far worse but I'm fed up of wasting my time with crap like this, having said that I'll still be stupid enough to be the first in the queue when the next low budget piece of crap gets released.
I suggest you pass this movie or when you're really a genre-lover, wait until you get it almost for free.
I can only talk about what was wrong with the first half because that's when I walked out and went to the pub for a much needed drink:  1) someone's standing on a balcony about to jump and so you send a helicopter to shine a searchlight on them???
I don't mind when writers/directors stray from the source material, just as long they take it in an original direction.
I wanted to like this film and I tried to ignore its flaws, but when there are so many, it's difficult to avoid them.
Later, when she arranges matters less formally and straddles his lap, he apologies because he still can't perform.
However, the secret is revealed when Jill takes down the family pictures -- parents have twins and those twins have twins and those twins have twins... All you have to do is listen to the names as she reads them off.
It's a great film, especially when you don't know the plot.
He and his sister Maddie, her best friend when the three of them were at college together, disappeared suddenly from her life several years ago and she had not heard from either of them since.
I think I found the movie and if I am right this take place on Christmas a boy was bothered and chased by boys from his class in school and they chaseed this boy into an abandon building while he found a stray cat and he took car of the cat by feeding it and taking care of the cat and then 1 day the kids from his class happen to do something to him at the cat and somehow at the end of this movie this boy ended up having a cat at his home  this movie i saw when I was a little boy in camp and I also saw it on hbo cinemax but I never knew the name and I been asking lots of people until now and I think this movie is the movie I been trying to look for years and I thought it came out in the 1970's since it is in color.
I only saw this movie once, 30 years ago, when it was first broadcast as a TV-movie.
We used to watch this movie once a year when I was in elementary school in Indiana.
He finds and befriends a stray cat, and learns an important lesson when the animal dies.
i would like to buy this movie can you tell me where i can purchase it,i was just a small kid when this movie aired,but and i can only remember bits of pieces of it.i would love to share this movie with my family now.please help.i want to see if this movie would bring back my childhood memories.
I saw it when I was 9 or 10 and have never forgotten it.
I suspect this film will mean more to those who love animals and feel the joy when helping a poor creature that needs help.
I clearly remember the scene when J.T.
I used to watch this movie every year faithfully when I was 6 or 7 yrs old.
I used to cry all the time, especially because I experienced so much sadness when I saw the stray cats in my neighborhood who I wanted to bring home but couldn't & I'd see these kittens/cats every day.
I'm definitely buying the DVD & I guarantee you when I watch it again I will be crying just as I did when I was a kid.
I read the book and when I saw that it was going to be on TV I had to watch.
I loved this movie since my family loves cats and I remember how it broke my heart when the kitty got killed.
I was lucky enough to experience it when first broadcast in 1969 when I was seven.
One of the best is Dr. Sobel's line when he walks into his home and sees the FBI he says,"...obsessive compulsive disorder?"
The most telling line is when he says..."What is my job here...to make you a well-adjusted criminal?"
They showed this movie to us in school when I was 7 or 8 years old and it was just so sad.
A lot of the story I couldn't remember because I was only about 7 or 8 when I last saw it, I'm 43 now.
JT, a little black boy being raised by his mother and grandmother, trying to bring him up right despite all the odds against him, finds a purpose in his life when he finds, adopts, and cares for a scroungy black and white alley cat.
when it was originally shown on CBS Saturday, December 13, 1969 (I was then 7 years old); I kept hearing about the show when promos were run during my favorite CBS Saturday morning shows, so I decided to see what all the hype was about.
Carousel sent me was unedited (there were two scenes CBS chopped out in order to fit the time slot when they last ran it involving Helen Martin, Pearl on "227," as a neighbor in the building where J.T.
Besides, who knows if and when CBS will ever rerun "J.T."
I saw this movie when I was about 10 and it had a profound effect on me.
I nearly choked on my custard doughnut when De Niro's tough guy character attempts to communicate in 'Psycho Babble'.
Kevin Hooks is an amazing, natural actor; he feigns indifference to everything in his life, but in his eyes you see his true feelings when he mentions the sick and abandoned cat he has found.
She sees her son sliding hopelessly downhill into a life of crime, when he comes home with a radio he's stolen.
builds a paradise for the cat, when his mother won't let him bring the animal home; he creates an oasis of comfort for his pet in an abandoned tenement, showing that he still has a huge capacity for love despite his harsh surroundings.
It isn't shown on TV much; the last time was 1987 on CBS when they were still committed to showing programs that meant something to young people.
They should not include moments when prime time shows fall victim to breaking world newscasts, presidential addresses, special mini-series broadcasts, and holiday specials...its just not an accurate assessment of a show's viewer base.
Julia Duffy was so memorable and funny as the spoiled, self-absorbed Princess Ariel that when she re prised that type of role as Stephanie on the 'Newhart', for the first season she was on that show I just saw her as The Princess...and that alone kept me watching 'Newhart'!
Things take an unexpected turn for our pal when his group of reserves are to be sent to a small country, Karifistan, that's about to be invaded by an evil, golf-loving dictator.
Of course, the film itself is low budget, contains mediocre acting, writing and directing (even though there are some surprisingly OK moments) but when Ernest is on the screen you can't help but smile and who cares if a film is good or not as long as it's funny?
I want to recommend you to lighten up and simply relax when you decide to watch it.
Taking aside when it's edited down for its content and for time, this is really a neat movie to watch when it comes on TV, which- if you have cable- is pretty often.
I still laugh at the same scenes I laughed at when I first saw the film over fifteen years ago.
Marisa Tomei is flat out FANTASTIC as Mona Lisa Vito--the wise cracking, marriage wanting, car fixing, pizza chick who accompanies Vinny (Joe Pesci--also brilliant) to Alabama in order to get his cousin (Ralph Macchio) and his friend (Mitchell Whitfield) off from murder charges when their car matches the suspect's car in a Sac-o-Suds homicide involving the clerk.
Joe Pesci has always been extremely serious when he needed to be, and also very funny when he needed to be and by God in this movie he is one of the funniest actors in one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.
The term 'underrated' springs to mind when describing this actress, not to mention 'under-used'.
There are some great scenes such as when the freight train disturbs Vinny's sleep in the early hours of the morning; when Vinny is wearing a white tracksuit and a pair of white sneakers and he slips on mud whilst pushing the car, and thus, his outfit and his suit for the court case is ruined, as a result.
Another great moment was when the lawyer was about to read out his opening statement- only for him to stutter along the way.
I'll be preparing breakfast, when the words spring to the surface of my mind, "No self-respecting Southerner uses instant grits."
They inadvertently take a can of tuna fish without paying, and when they're pulled over as murder suspects, they end up "confessing" to a crime they don't even realize they're being charged with, because of carefully parsed conversations aided by their paranoia about the rough-and-tumble justice of the South.
There is barely a hint of his psycho image here, except in one of the movie's funniest scenes, when the kid who's unrelated to Vinny sees him coming toward the jail cell and thinks he's a rapist.
Well, after 15 minutes my Mom was howling with every morning wake up, every confrontation with the judge, and we almost lost her when Austin Pendelton started his "stuttering" defense!
The most memorable, though, is one in which Dr. Sobol dreams that he is Don Vito Corleone in the movie `The Godfather,' when he is shot while buying some fruit.
Vinny's inexperience cause problems, yet when he does get the taste of courtroom drama, he gives out his serving of justice to the platter.
It'll still make you laugh continuously, but not as hard as the first time you saw it, when what was coming was a surprise.
I think my favorite part was when Mona Lisa was on the stand talking about which cars were involved in the murder case, she just got into a fight with Vinny and she refuses to help him, but she does and he kisses her hand and you can tell they made up, but it's just their looks that are just plain priceless!
They make me laugh more than anyone else in this picture, the scenes I particularly laugh the hardest at is when Vinny has been invited by the prosecuting attorney to go hunting and he doesn't know what to wear and Lisa goes into a tirade about the deer being shot and his brain lying on the floor and not caring what the "son of a bitch" who shot him was wearing.
Another is when Vinny is trying to prepare for a case and she heaps on more pressure by talking about her biological clock, it is a lot more funny in the film and you should watch it for just those scenes alone.
You cheer for him when he starts to do the right things in court and will him on to find evidence that will prove his cousin and friend innocent of murder.
You don't know how it will be resolved, you are in a way in the same boat as Stan and Bill as you watched them leave the Sac o' suds without killing the clerk and you wonder who could have done it and how the witnesses are so convinced that Stan and Bill did it and at least at the end, you have a satisfying conclusion when you find out they have caught the bad guys in another state.
He was such a treat especially when he couldn't understand what Vinny was saying when he said "yutes" and couldn't understand some of the other words Vinny said with his thick Brooklyn accent.
Also, the movie's best moment arises when a freight train disturbs Pesci's sleep at five in the morning.
One thing that is accurately captured is the fish-out-of-water experience of a city lawyer when subjected to trying a case in a far-flung rural county.
Live action blue screen and low tech crawling up the side of the building when its on the flat simpler, but the imagery is richer and more full.
I remember the AMAZING SPIDER-MAN from when I was a kid,it was one of the first memorys I have when we came to this country.
Great Guns takes us back to war days, a period when people were having to tighten their belts because times were hard.
He's hilarious when he's crying!
We'll always have the best of their classic '30s Hal Roach talkies to fall back on when we want the cream of the crop, but there are moments to be enjoyed in the Fox films too, if we can let go and stop comparing them to something else.
Try not to laugh when Stan shoves a crow down Ollie's pants during an inspection, or when Stan and Ollie are forced to build a pontoon bridge (I liked Stan's choice of wood).
We have not read the novel which served as the basis of the film, which is misleading, since one expects to refer to a Cuban situation, when in reality, the DelaMesas work to help the regime of Chile's former president Allende.
Wonderful movie that clears out your mind and leaves you purified when feeling so dirty.
That is to say this film focuses, in a really lovely accurate way, on a child struggling to understand the real world around them, especially when the adults around her don't tell her the full story.
This is played-out in a scene when the young Anna awakes to find her home swarming with "barbudos" and no parents.
Despite this Anna is treated like an equal when among her parents and the "barbudos", because they make the effort to explain and reason to her the things she doesn't understand.
She is unable to question the system once she is a part of it; this supported by emphasized further when she questions her teacher over a story involving the dilemmas facing a goat.
Anna is forced to give up the home she loves and the nanny she adores when her father quits his job in order to dedicate himself full time to fighting for the proletariat against the repressive corporate powers of the world.
She is bourgeois to the core, following the lead of her maternal grandparents, who own a vineyard in Bordeaux, and her favorite nanny and housekeeper who lost everything to the Communists when Fidel Castro came to power in Cuba.
So when that time of the day comes, she has to stand up and go outside the classroom door and wait.
The other girls may laugh, but when she gets into a fight with one of them, she manages to win her over afterwards so that they are friends, even though their parents are not.
There is in the background the political disputes between the Right and the Left, between parents who change the subject when the question how babies are made is brought up, and those who tell the truth, in short between the bourgeois and the bohemian.
this is the transition story of nine-year-old Anna de la mesa (played by Nina kervel-bey) who's life changes forever when her parents begin an ideological sea-change.
for example Anna's mother makes a comment that she can get the kind of issues-political writing she is turning her repertoire to published in Marie Clare, but later throws out a copy of the magazine when her article isn't published, proving that just because you want to save the world doesn't mean Marie Clare does.
she also says that all radicals have beards, which, when repeated later by Anna, is met with an inquiry as to whether Santa clause is a radical by her kid-brother Francois (played by Benjamin feuillet).
another witty example at one point her parents take her to a rally to demonstrate solidarity, but later in the film, when 'exercising solidarity' with her classmates who all believe Rome to have existed before Greece despite her knowing better, she learns that solidarity and being a sheep are two different things.
but when her dad tells her that is being a sheep, she asks how he knows that what he is doing is solidarity, not just being a sheep.
added to how delightfully self-aware the film is, la faute Ã  Fidel is a smart film that takes on the role of exposing the ways in which children may be victimized by the ideas of their parents, even when those ideas are well- meaning and progressive.
The plot revolves around little nine-year-old Anna( played to perfection by tense, brooding, occasionally warming to a welcome smile Nina Kervel), whose life is turned upside down when her parents abruptly change from well-to-do upper middle class people to leftist activists, with a feminist inclination concerning the mother.
The movie really charmed me from the beginning to the end, ringing true all the time (the early seventies are well captured, whether when it comes to the production values or the depiction of the mentalities of the time).
This woman's problems will seem like nothing when Ben obtains his new client.
He and his accomplices, including a chubby and clumsy bodyguard named Jelly (Joe Viterelli), are in the process of significant business when Vitti experiences an anxiety attack.
Rinko Kikuchi is fantastic as their sidekick who always know how to make a scene even when she's rarely says anything and the real scene stealer here is the Oscar caliber performance of Rachel Weisz who not only manages to steal the movie but manages to steal your heart as well as a lonely heiress who craves adventure and she's gives the movie the same kind of adventure and fun that it deserves.
The only evidence of which is at the beginning of the movie when we are subjected to a long and lame story how they tricked some kids out of $30.
As you would be, when you are young, beautiful and rich.
Bloom and Penelope meet cute when the brothers arrange for her to run him over with her current yellow Lamborghini.
She's so good even when she's jumping for joy it doesn't feel overdone.
It's only when the real starts to overwhelm the make-believe that Johnson's pervasive sense of romance takes hold and the real purpose of Stephen's contrivances -- to make his brother happy -- becomes touching.
Their first con that we see, when they are 13 and 10, get them 30 dollars from the neighborhood kids, and a kickback from the local dry cleaner!
Because of a botched allergy test when she was a young girl, she grew up virtually isolated in her large home, but on her own learned many things, including languages, card tricks, music, etc.
The first thing I asked myself when I walked out of the theater was: "What's with the silly hats?".
I particularly enjoyed her goofy/passionate reactions when she's kissed by Adrien Brody's character, Bloom (that's the only name he's addressed by in the film; it's one of the few things that's never explained), and we realize this is the very first time Penelope has EVER been kissed by ANY man!

All that said, I'll still be lining up for tickets ASAP when Johnson's next film comes out.
Everything changes when Bloom decides to get out of the game and Stephen lures him in for one last swindleÂa beautiful and quirky millionaire (Rachel Weisz) who yearns for a taste of adventure.
Sometimes this excess-of-style works well, like when we flash through all of the "hobbies" Penelope does in her countless spare time at her mansion.
His use of humor infuses a heart into the proceedings and a true bond and relationship between Stephen and Bloom, two men that learn to hate each other at the end of a job, but always come to the others help when needed at the start.
This isn't sleepless in seattle or when harry met sally.
At the beginning when they all hugged each other, Shannon and Jennie didnt seem all that friendly towards each other, they hugged, but I think it was more for the cameras.
Then when they all sat down Luke Perry sat in the middle of Shannon and Jennie and they barely said anything directly to one another.
Overall it was good to see the majority of the original cast back, unfortunately it didnt talk about what I and probably what most people wanted to hear about - was there any bad blood between the cast when Shannon walked out 10 years ago and was it all as bad as the magazines portrayed.
He picked her up when she was 10, and looked after her onboard ever since.
However, things start to change when a young man joins a group of anglers to fish on board the old man's boat.
He had plans to marry the girl when she turns 17, and hurriedly brings forward his plan, while driving the young man away.
Think of that scene in James Dean's "Rebel Without a Cause" where the father of Dean's love interest becomes angry when she still wants to have close physical affection with him, you can tell that buried beneath he has desires for his daughter, and hence he becomes easily angry and strikes out at her.
Living with him is a young girl who came to the boat when she was seven.
The old man intends to marry the young girl when she turns 17.
A film set entirely on a lonely fishing boat, "The Bow" is about a 60-year-old man who takes a young, lost, 7-year-old girl in as his own, raises her like a daughter, and makes big plans to marry her when she turns 17.
The girl, who in the film is 16, is played by Yeo-reum Han who, when she smiles, is extremely beautiful.
This indecisive behavior leads to an illogical structure and uneven pacing, for example when a moody love-making sequence is immediately followed by an extremely violent murder vision.
The moment when the girl was rejecting the old man's hand at night is the moment when the ego is alone, separate from his soul, in a dark night of suffering that is necessary for it to understand his mistakes.
His movies were pretty much all "entertainment" Romanians had in a time when the dictator Ceausescu cut the only TV program to just two hours a day, between 20 and 22 o'clock(and this in black and white).
I liked Imola Kezdi ("HoltvÃ¡gÃ¡ny 1973) as Ana Criveanu, who falls in love for the prince, and later on kills herself when rejected by the prince, although I had the feeling she did not look exactly like a 20 years old girl, as the script requires.
Maia Morgenstern ("The Oak" - 1992, "Betrayal" - 1993, "Ulysses' Gaze" - 1995, Procust's Bed" Â 2001, "The Passion of Christ" 2004) is excellent as Amalia Frunzetti, the prince companion and mistress, though she does not look like 30 (Maia was 42 in 2004 when the film was made).
Because when they finally talk, foreigners might not hear it but the tone is often horribly false, especially with the German accent of the blond actress.
I do not understand how a director cannot hear it when editing.
If you watch it in English, you will notice times when the lips and the dialogue don't quite synch and that can be annoying, although I wager that French speaking viewers will have a more rewarding time of it.
Loud gunshots, car crashes and fist fights are utilized as an attempt to break up the monotony of the script by Leclerq, Nicolas Peufaillit, Franck Philippon , and Aude Py (yes, it took four people to write this film when it felt like one person could have written it in their sleep).
It is short and set in the north of England at a time when the industrial revolution has brought sudden wealth to the nouveu-riche of common but fortunate entrepreneurs.
This 4-piece work dates from a time when realizing Dickens' ideas was just as important as creating a detailed drama.
I do have one regret - and if you want to read the novel first do not go beyond this point below: SUPER SPOILER COMING UP: In the novel, Mrs. Sparskit is jealous of Louisa marrying Josiah, and when Louisa has her affair with Harthouse she spies on her.
This will be a hit when it gets released soon as it is a feel good film.
The bedroom door was locked from the inside when they found the body and her throat was slit with a piece of glass that was found in her hand, so the police close the case as suicide.
I can't say I blame him, especially when working with Rosalba Neri, but the lack of excitement here is really intolerable.
The two spend their time at an airplane hangar maintained by Jason's Uncle Ed (Dallen Gettling) and end up on the ride of their lives (and a ride for their lives) when they unintentionally ruin the scheming of dangerous mob misfit Silvio (Stephen Baldwin).
What begins as a very typical new-kid-trying-to-adjust-in-school premise drastically changes when we discover that said new kid Kyle is a total badass.
But Flyboys embraces the fun and in turn it's easy to appreciate the nonstop, over-the-top mayhem, especially when generous bouts of unexpectedly dark comedy break up the sinister action.
It had me laughing at some points, inhaling sharp breaths when on the edge of my seat, and nearly crying at other times.
Gianna was also Marco's lover, and the two scheme to murder Nancy because when she "comes of age", the inheritance is hers.
They don't make this kind of movies these days...right from the start till the very end it's all full-throttle action...and the thing that gets you is this : you don't expect much of it when you see the title and info, thinking "yeaahhh...another dumbass kids movie"...and though it has a few aspects that defy a realistic movie, but man, it becomes more and more engaging by the minute and keeps you focused with its breathtaking scenes and intensity...I mean, damn...this is a well-built movie people, good acting, good plot, strong moral values...and it's all done by simple means and lines, not like the majority of the movies you see now with great actors, boring scenarios and pathetic lines.
The first ten minutes, when we see how Jason and Kyle become friends, set the tone really.
After an hour of watching you wonder when the movie will collapse.
This is one of those films that I would have watched 100 times over the summer when I was a kid.
Things get a bit strange when Nancy begins to suspect her mother didn't commit suicide and puts the moves on both of her hosts.
How often does that happen when you go to a movie down at the Cineplex?
I only watched the first 4 episodes of Dragonball Gt and when I saw the atmosphere, characters (especially Pan), and synopsis, I rejected to watch DBGT.
I mean it shows how to be brave, when Pan dies and Chibi Goku goes on an adventure to search for the 4 star ball.
It's also funny, when he and Pak become scared from Zangiya, The blue alien they meet in the dark forest.
It even shows the appearance of the great Son Goku (The original Goku) when Chibi Goku becomes disappointed and cries when he realizes that the 4 star ball can't revive Pan, so Son Goku appears and tells him that he needs all 7 balls.
I like the last part when Chibi Goku remembers the words of his great grandfather Son Goku.
So when his granddaughter Pan gets sick, he's not there for her yet he is there for his great-great grandson, that's helpful but still proves that he's a lazy runaway.
This leads to a few comical instances when you get to see a sobbing, runny nosed Goku running for dear life.
However, things turn sinister when the housekeeper divulges some information that means Dorothy's death may not have been suicide...
The pair doesn't share any scenes together that are as great as those between Neri and Barbara Bouchet in Amuck, but Silvio Amandio obviously enjoys filming lesbian scenes; and when they're this good, I enjoy watching them!
The hardening of this tangled web is the time when their lives intertwine into a central fixated message about the love of life.
You will find yourself having a easy & good time and having a worthwhile cinematic experience when you go see "Hard Times (Malas Temporadas)".
Not that I understand Italian myself, but when a film whose soul and emotion is quintessentially Italian is transcribed in a foreign language, the magic is lost in translation.
I was eleven when I saw this in theaters, okay.
Christopher Lloyd supplies all the laughs as a stressed out business man, but his life really turns upside down when Ramsey rents out the apartment his wife offered.
Suburban Commando is a very good film and its one of Hulk Hogan`s best films.It is one of My favorite films.I was thrilled when it came out because back when wrestling was wrestling it was so fun watching the then WWF Prime Time Wrestling show and seeing the promotions on it while watching some of the best wrestling ever seen back in 1991.Anyway the film is action packed and has many,many funny moments.One of My favorite actors Christopher Lloyd stars along with the Hulkster and he is very good in it.Christopher Neame had a very short part and I think he should have had a much larger role in the film.William Ball,Shelley Duvall,Roy Dotrice,and Larry Miller all put on good performances.I was amazed to see Mark Callaway (The Undertaker) in the film.
when i first watched this with 2 other people i was slightly tipsy....but that just made it better...for 1 and a half hours we were on the floor laughing it's that funny....and the best part is it's funny for all the wrong reasons it's so bad it's great, the dialogue is hilarious and hogans acting is even better.
Nothing is explained in a cut-and-dry way, but we know that Eddie refuses to talk about any of it, even when directly confronted about it by the one woman in this film who does care about him.
I was neutral when I started watching this movie, nothing against Eliza Dushku or any of the other actors, but this movie killed all the future Eliza Dushku movies..
She goes to him for a few words of reassurance on those occasions when her hallucinations begin scratching at the door.
I liked her even before when I watched Tru Calling.
Watch it when it comes on TV...and watch it as the background ambiance while playing World of Warcraft or as your bedtime going-to-sleep movie.
It doesn't always work Â she's not especially convincing when she has to descend into madness Â but most of the time she's a cut and a half above her usual fare; it's as if she finally decided to take a role where her looks aren't a factor and actually act, and it was nice to see for the most part she could pull it off (hey, they aren't going to see her as an 'adult' actress in Hollywood as long as she plays cheerleaders and works for Joss Whedon).
A handsome and lonely gym teacher Eddie Collins can't perform sexually due to his constant watching of his mother undress while he hid in her closet as a child.His only recourse is to kill the women he tries to sleep with and stash them in a pigeon hutch on his roof.He hires a prostitute to dress as his dead mother,the only way he is able to achieve sexual gratification..."The Arousers" is the first film of director Curtis Hanson.Originally shot in 1971 under the title "Sweet Kill",this film lingered on the shelf until 1973 when executive producer Roger Corman had Hanson shoot two days of nudity inserts to spice-up the film.Angus Scrimm of "Phanatsm" fame has a small cameo here.Overall,this is a good piece of sleaze from the early 70's that should satisfy the exploitation fans out there looking for plenty of nudity,sex and violence.7 out of 10.
You know it's a bad sign when the serial killer seems more sane than the lead character.
Another classic visual from this episode is when Scully removes the alien fetus from the canister.
The Erlenmeyer Flask keeps you jumping up until the end when the ultimate sacrifice is made to save Mulder.
What a great way to end the first season of the x-files.An apparent unrelated.minor car chase leads the agents to the discovery of what seems to be concrete evidence of a government conspiracy.The early sequence of the man being chased who then is shot emits green blood which has toxic properties is a classic.Also Deep Throat plays an important part i this episode though can the agents trust him after his lies in E.B.E?A stunning moment happens when Mulder enters the warehouse and before his very eyes is bodies in tanks of water.When he returns with Scully the bodies are gone much to Mulders disgust.He thought he had irrefutable,indisputable proof.This episode must be watched!
Steven also his hearing his fan base and decided to do his own fights scenes, also at the end he gets back to his 'movie' roots when he goes after the man who set him up in the beginning.
Reminds you of the good old days when Van Damme and Seagal were backed by big budgets.
Really, I couldn't keep track of Good People and the Bad People, or when they switches sides or why, or which side Black Tech Guy is on from minute to minute.
Apart from that he overacts when the dude can't even act, he pronounces every sentence with incredible agony, thinking it probably raises his 'acting' skills to a higher plane and makes him look even a more bad guy.
Upon further inspection, the fight scenes (as usual) are shot extremely fragmented (why use one edit, when forty will do) so it's hard to tell.
John isn't happy when he learns the truth & is even less happy when his best mate Radio Jones (Zaa Nkweta) is killed during the fighting.
I was confused when I ran across this on the hotel TV (with no guide screen on the cable).
You notice things like this when there are no interesting characters to follow, no coherent plot, and the dialog hurts your ears.
John and Maxine kill everybody in the bank but when some guy asks not to shoot him John just punches him in the balls?!?)
Reminds you of the good old days when Van Damme and Seagal were backed by big budgets.
Dresham signals for a policeman's attention, policeman walks over, Seeger somehow manages to master the art of teleportation, and mysteriously ends up in a van that happens to drive by when Dresham jumps out of the vehicle the split second Seeger disappears.
The plot is ridiculous and silly and most of it doesn't make a lick of sense, but since when did it have to in a Seagal movie?
I don't know whose idea it was to use shoddy special effects, when Bay actually uses some great ones.
So when Christy jumps aboard a bus, she's already been fired from her job and is in need of antidepressants for a diagnosed borderline personality disorder spurred by her guilt over her sister's injuries.
Christy also investigates the details about Vanessa's burial, as well as her medical files (which are now in private access for John Locke), all the while succumbing to near psychotic states when she suffers random seizures that lead her to draw darkly artistic portraits of people and threatening symbols.
The basic plot has a young girl returning home when her old caretaker dies.
Odd shifts in perspective, some genuine creepy, but not too in your face imagery and willingness to go sans blood and guts except as required make this pretty much a throw back to the old days of horror when less is more.
In fact, "willing viewers," as described above -- in other words, those viewers who have managed to retain their childlike sense of wonder and innocence when they sit down to watch a film -- should be left completely unaware until the final revelation.
I have to say that I didn't expect much from this film when I rented it today, but I was really surprised by it.
We see unstated confusion and conflict between the doctor and his son regarding his mother and then marital tension, loving tension, between the Gibbs when the mother comes home.
He is at his best when he lays out the town in the first act description.
And just when you think that you can't take it anymore, they throw in another half an hour.
I saw this in theatrical release when it came out, and just recently on home video.
the film isn't all sex like some people think, but when the erotic elements rear their head, the intensity and focus of these scenes throw people off kilter.
She gets the chance when her husband Hugo brings Henry to stay with them while he works on his novel.
when this sort of thing seemed so cool.
"I saw your true nature when you were dancing out there."
The much publicised erotic element only really rears its head for a torrid 25 minute period in the middle of the film when Anais goes from one lover to the next.
Director Phillip Kaufman stirred up quite a bit of controversy when this film was first being released, most likely because of the intensity of the love scenes, but after watching the DVD I am now thinking that this film could have maybe slipped by with an R rating.
*SPOILER* And, you have to love the plausable ending where the native people when in the end by using drugs to call their spirit people to make the dam blow up.
the film isn't all sex like some people think, but when the erotic elements rear their head, the intensity and focus of these scenes throw people off kilter.
But in the torrid climax when Anais' wild ways have finally caught up with her, it all comes together nicely to leave a feeling of completion.
Actually, Hilary Brougher raises this picture somewhat above its disadvantages through nuance, innuendo, and lack of blatancy, though this very ambiguity does ultimately queer the ending, as in, I don't really get what's going on with the shrink character when credits roll.
(The legal age when a fetus is considered viable varies but is generally around 24 weeks).
I found myself leaning forward and concentrating, afraid I might miss something, just as one does when listening to a fascinating but quietly spoken person or when eavesdropping.
She has fine legal training, but looks back to the time of her last pregnancy when she knew - she just 'knew' - that something was wrong.
The storyline could be seized on to advocate stronger obedience to religious injunctions (Stephanie thinks that when things go wrong that God is punishing her) or to question the whole basis of sex-education influenced by U.S. religious (Christian) beliefs.
Most of the times when we catch her subsequently or in flashbacks, she is wearing something red or else the light is strangely subdued.
She concludes, when asked, that is suggests, "it is harder to live a lie than it is to tell the truth and be punished."
Strong white is used twice in the film in key scenes: at one point, Stephanie is ascending the stairs into bright light (but when we continue upstairs there is only darkness).
In one interesting scene in the schoolroom, the youngsters having learnt about 'making babies' and encouraged to use baby beepers to better understand when a baby needs frequent attention, the teacher turns to the topic of 'not making babies' and invites the class for input.
I guarantee you'll get misty eyed when Grandpa leads them in the blessing of the meal.
Tomme goes visiting the apartment complex where the parents lived when another tribe armed by white men stole his tribe's women.
Really enjoyed this film when I saw it at the Sydney film festival.
I guess when you have 40 plus film credits under your belt and have worked under Peter Weir, Russell Burton, Chris Noonan and John Duigan among others you tend to pick up a thing or two!
I've read other comments that said it has been passed over for any kind of distribution and when I was at the screening the producers said that it was rejected by every festival.
Michael's steady girlfriend Kerry (Heather Burns) supports the concept of saving the business but when her family gets involved an incident occurs which damages all concerned.
The only "I'm being taught about lobster farms" moment I had was when a character explained that they don't actually breed lobsters, which I thought was rather interesting.
I look forward to when this movie is released in more theaters so I can see it again.
It is nice to escape when you are the movies, but it also nice to believe what you are escaping to can happen.
I didn't see it when it was released.
Clint Eastwood ain't no fool when he cast her in Eiger Sanction.
I have seen this show when I was growing up and I liked it very much  Here in my country, the most of TV series of America came in under some format almost without any delay since decades ago.
Part of me admires it for its hard edged eco message coupled with its violent action packed adventure elements while part of me hates it for its convienent mystical mumbo jumbo when the script requires Tomme and the invisible people to escape from a tight spot .
Hold on , it`s an admirable film despite the flaws , in many ways THE EMARALD FOREST is the type of film Steven Seagal would have made if he had any talent , it`s a film that doesn`t talk down to the audience unlike nearly every eco-thriller made and does make the point that when everyone you love and everything you survey is in mortal peril then violence is the only way you can defend yourself .
The one genuine laugh you'll receive is at the movie's end, when Dildo encounters a friend thought long dead, and his cheesy, over powering fake laughter forces Dildo's actress to lose her composure and start genuinely cracking up.
I saw this movie when it was first released.
But as circumstances would have it he's accidentally discovered to have super-powers by a lady cop who takes an interest in him, and them when Mr.
God Bless Mr Arkin to not have any pride when he made this film (I don't see how he could have, such a big gamble) But then again I had not heard of it until a couple weeks ago.
The songs are generally fun, even when predictable- despite being written by a number of different people (including Richard O' Brien!)
I first saw this film when I was but a young lad, and loved it - the fact that some of the film was set in Australia played something of a major part in this - although some bits frightened me for no apparent reason.
Although they're quite well written - the "Hypno-Ray" song still sticks in my memory - the songs do seem a bit out of place, but when you're watching the story of an alcoholic ex-superhero who's retired to Australia, well...
Count me among the guilty for having rented this back in the 80's, when straight to video had begun to glut the market with piles of these forgettable "horror" films.
i'm simply left speechless when i see a film like this.
A construction designer working in the Amazon is visiting a logging site with his family when his seven-year-old son Tommy is kidnapped by native tribesmen and vanishes into the rainforest.
The murderer and the child grow closer together despite the law being after him and the pair develops a friendship that is shattered when the mother discovers the sheltered criminal.
I had not heard of this film and had no idea what to expect from it but when I saw it I was overwhelmed.
A movie that totally blew me away when I first saw it.
My favorite time in my life was when I was the second male in a triad, a very rich and satisfying life.)
Even with that, the film was censored on release and, after 1934, when the Hayes Code was in stronger effect, it wasn't allowed to be shown at all.
While it wasn't explicit in Coward's stage play, one would have to be deaf and blind not to get the subtext, especially with Coward and Alfred Lunt as the two male leads when the play opened.
Of course, modern audiences must take the word of obsessive cinephiles like myself when we tell you that this movie was once considered wildly indecent.
An unremarkable, but typical, example is when Cooper runs out of his swanky new apartment to retrieve a note from Hopkins which he had angrily tossed out the window: Lubitsch makes sure that when Cooper picks up the note, it's a truly exterior shot -- no mattes.
However, despite all this, the film really is mostly tease without a whole lot of action--though there is some implied sex (such as when March spent the night and was having breakfast with Hopkins halfway through the film).
You just don't hear the word "sex" spoken very often in the 30's, so that when you do hear it, as you will several times in this film, it's a little jarring (but in a good way).
And Max...he is reminded that the Egelbauers of the world never cared for Gilda, so when he announces his divorce it will double or triple his business.
He does have one of the most memorable moments in "Lubitsch Touch" cinema, when we see him and Hopkins go into the bed chamber on their wedding night.
It really works, and is as racy today as it must have been when it came out.  
In fact, the censors must have had a heart attack when they saw "Design," for this is one of the most sexually frank of the pre-Code Hollywood movies; premarital sex, cohabitation, adultery and frigidity are all clearly portrayed-- but, as always with Lubitsch, they are implied rather than shown.
One of the catchiest lines in the movie was "when you F*ck a duck it's hard on the duck, so you have to break it's neck when you're done.
Admittedly, this movie was riddled with problems, but I think Quentin Tarantino said it best when he commented on Brian DePalma's "Bonfire of the Vanities" that it takes a director of quality to make a truly disastrous film.
That being said, I have to wonder why a film like Flypaper falls so hard when films like "The Unbelievable Truth" launch a prolific career and a borderline cult following.
For all the griping that goes on about unoriginal, cookie-cutter genre pieces, shouldn't we have just a little generosity when a director has the guts to break the mold?
I hated this movie when I watched it, and after watching it again now I know why I hate it so much.
Instead of leaving you with the message that you need to stand up for yourself when outside pressures become overwhelming, this film lets you know that violence is always the answer, even when it comes to deciding whether someone is innocent or not.
Here, was an opportunity lost when the filmmakers shortchanged us By not expanding enough on that particular point.
We still don't know when we'll see each other again, but we will.
There are some truly mesmerizing moments here; badgers mucking about, a lynx chasing the fox through a snow-littered forest; one scene in particular when the fox is being tormented by a pack of wolves is quite intense and even frightening at times.
The story of the relationship between the 10-year old child and the fox is even less convincing the second time around, when you know where it's headed.
Took my two daughters to see this and they loved it, my oldest cried at the end.but she was the one who wanted to see it again tonight when she saw it at the video shop.
I really enjoyed that it was shown when Lily wasn't comfortable, such as the fire and the room (trying not to spoil too much here).
Between the two, more tension and drama was given to the latter, especially when dealing with traditional foes like wolves, and granted, those sequences were fairly intense especially when the child got embroiled in it.
I therefore find it deplorable that this parsimony is given up in the last minutes, when suddenly two additional actors (the girl as a grown-up woman, and her son) are introduced.
Especially not when compared to some of its namesakes, like Cannibal Ferox, Jungle Holocaust, Eaten Alive or Mountain of the Cannibal God.
One of them bites his Captain's (John Saxon) arm when being rescued and he has the dormant virus that will come to haunt him in later years.
And I don't think that's what Margheriti expected, so I was wondering if he experienced the same kind of reaction from the audience when he first screened this film back in 1980.
And when it's slow, there are lots of cute teenage girls in the altogether to gaze at.
He has a great scene when he wakes up in the village only to see his son, Tomme, sleeping peaceful and embracing his girl, both practically nude in the next hammock.
Things get out of hand and start "spreading" when the patients attack members of the hospital staff and begin transmitting the cannibal virus...  CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE is a really entertaining and somewhat novel spin to the over-done cannibal genre.
He doesn't seem too bothered by the fact that when he finds him, they're eating human flesh, or that one of them bites him, and infects him with some kind of cannibal virus.
1980: a drab, miserable year, but a time when the culture was still pretty active and vibrant.
The Vietnam war had only been over for five-years when Cannibal Apocalypse was released, so the wounds were still ripe.
We should remember that this movie was made at a time when the draft still-existed.
when a film is copied from a book its got to be at least a little bit like the book itself but this does not and when put beside other horror hammer films like 'the devil rides out' it makes itself look like a waste when there was so much that could have been done to make it a fine film.
However, despite all the problems, somehow, eventually, a finished product was deliveredÂonly to suffer from some hasty re-editing when some bright spark commented that the original ending bore too much resemblance to that of an earlier Hammer movie, Scars of Dracula.
The usual ingenuity was employed to stretch a small budget a long way, lots of British talent was available at micro-cost, a Hollywood A-lister came on board, it was based on probably the best of Dennis Wheatley's black magic novels, and in an age when, thanks to THE EXORCIST, occult movies were in vogue, it might well have regenerated vital interest in the ailing studio.
Why, right at the end, are we suddenly introduced to the mysterious properties of flint-stone, and why, when it's got the blood of one of Satan's acolytes on it, will flint automatically protect the hero from demonic attack (if this is a part of arcane lore, how on Earth were we supposed to know Â because the impression this movie gives is that we should be blown away by this revelation and say: "Wow, why didn't I see that coming?")?
Richard Widmark said to the director, "when I say turnover, turnover, it's going to happen."
At first it was fun to play as several of the Simpsons characters but when they started repeating their dialogue for the 50th time it became mighty tedious and tiresome.
This was especially true regarding the Invisible People who Boorman portrayed as a mysterious and elusive tribe which is demonstrated when they are camouflaged in the jungle and manage to stroke Tommy's face with a feather undetected by his family who are only a few feet a away from the Invisible People.
The first major clichÃ© we can see in the movie is when the white men come they bring with them guns and alcohol and of course they exploit the natives.
Nancy Ordway, "Nanny" (Peggy Ann Garner), is a 20 year-old want-to-be writer when she arrives in New York City knowing only an aging uncle who acts on Broadway when he can get jobs.
"I'm...well, to be perfectly honest with you, I'm Miss Carlotta Marin's husband," says Brien when he meets Nanny for the first time.
"I have a name of my own, of course, but it seems stupid to use it when I can get so much more attention simply telling whose husband I am."
Wheeler became part of Patrick Quentin in 1936 when, at 24, he began collaborating with Richard Webb.
Wheeler became the sole Patrick Quentin in the Fifties when Webb retired.
To hang herself when she could abuse drugs!"
She brings her brand of energy to her roles, so that she stands out even when the role or even her acting isn't all that good, she still shines.
He is good, as is the movie, but the highlights are definitely when Ms. Rogers is on screen.
That was theatrical producer Van Heflin's mistake when, on the terrace of Broadway diva Ginger Rogers' apartment, he took pity on hopeful young writer Peggy Ann Garner.
But when it turns out not only that she was pregnant but that she was murdered, the police sensibly enough find in Heflin their prime suspect.
I was a kid when it first came out and I've seen every episode.
I first became aware of the term "ecology" when I signed up for a masters-level college class of the same name in 1965.
What does it mean to trust, surrender, take and give sexual intimacy, and love when you are explicitly denying your identity and suspect what even your love for your spouse?
One of the best scenes is when Columbo goes to an exclusive tailor in Beverly Hills and ask about buying a suit.
Movies like this one are fun to sit back and grin a little bit at how serious they really were when making it, and poke some fun at a young Charlie Sheen and Randy Quaid.
I don't know how many times i watched this movie when i was younger.
(always wanted to say that) Thats when he comes back as The Wraith.
But, its still just as fun to watch as it was when i was younger and watched it.
I discovered this little gem of a movie when my dad bought a crap load of DVD's from one of his friends.
Two bloopers I caught were when Skank and Gutterhead had a shotgun.
Back in 1986, The Wraith just about qualified as a moderately entertaining alternative should the video rental shop be all out of copies of Aliens or Top Gun; however, when watched twenty three years later from a nostalgic point of view, this silly supernatural revenge flick actually proves to be a whole heap of fun.
Sheen, though top-billed, has little to do and isn't particularly charismatic when he's on screen.
After seeing again Deliverance, which was thrilling when it was first released, and Excalibur, poetical, Wagnerian but a little bit out of date (regarding the shining 70's fake armors), Emerald Forest deepens philosophy and ethnology.
I was only a year old when The Wraith was released into theaters.
As I grew older, I would always try to catch it when it was on T.V.
The terrible dialogue is delivered straight faced which just doesn't work when your making a film about a supernatural car.
Why doesn't the wraith just blow Packard away with the shotgun when he had the chance?
This is one of my personal favorites not just because it has a truly awesome car,The Tubo Interseptor,but it also has a cool almost Western like plot.The story starts with a bizarre spirit forming in the middle of a vacant Arizona road,he apparantly comes from outter space,along with his super-flashy car.This spirit or Wraith as he is referred to in the title is actually the avenging spirit of a murdered local kid back to take on the gang who killed him and that has been terrorizing the roads of Arizona.Charlie Sheen plays the Wraith and Sheryle Fenn plays his girl-friend who is being practically held captive by the leader of the same motor gang that killed Sheen's characterfrom the beginning.Naturally,The Wraith,or Jake as he is called when in human form,takes on these motor thugs one-on-one in some very cool and dizzying death races.In my humble opinion,the best part of this film is the soundtrack.With awesome hard rock from Ozzy,Billy Idol,Robert Palmer,Lion,Honey-moon suite and my personal fav Motley Crue.
Back when Martin Sheen's father immigrated to the US from Spain and John Cassavetes's father immigrated to the US from Greece, they probably never guessed that their grandchildren would co-star in this sort of movie.
Hell, back in the days when Ron Howard played Opie on "The Andy Griffith Show", people probably never guessed that his brother would star in this sort of movie.
I don't know what people would have thought when Randy Quaid debuted in "The Last Picture Show".
I was surprised when I looked at the TV Mag and they gave it 1 star.
He also has a love interest Keri (Played by Sherilyn Fenn) who was once his girlfriend when he had a different face.On to more things the soundtrack is Fantastic.
The script is hokey, yet there are some really tender moments, like when Billy Hankins realizes who the Wraith really is.
It makes me laugh when I read bad reviews of this movie.
And for people moaning about rubbish acting, check out Matthew Barry's performance when Billy Hankins realises Jake is his brother.
The effects, too, could use some work in the beginning of the film; it's hard to suspend belief when a closeup of a zombie face shows the reflective glare from the cream-based makeup and, around it, a half-inch border of normal skin.
Life gets a little more interesting when one of Maxx's buddies is attacked by a weird looking guy with silver skin (note to director: zombies are supposed to have a gray complexion!)
The adult zombies eat flesh because their minds have been corrupted by bigotry, greed, corruption and all the things we experience when we grow up.
As the film starts it is somewhat promising, as the shaky camera moves through a seemingly abandoned house by the means of clumsy editing and what can only be described as library muzak in the background, you however comfort yourself with the fact that this is an amateur film and hopefully when the movie gets going all of those failures will be forgotten.
The list could go on, but I'm getting bored with this review, just as I was when watching this poor excuse for entertainment.
this zombie movie was just corny,and made no sense.It was also so slow the jokes were just hours long and the dialogue was cut and so slow this was one of the worst movies i have ever seen by far.Mostly I never read ratings and decide if the movie is bad or not on my own but this was one of those cases when you should.There's bad and there's horribly stupid disgusting waist of time and this is past that.The makeup was horrible and was more of a porno then a zombie movie,The acting was the worst i have ever seen, a 5 year old could do better.Wow I'm still disgusted on how horribly bad this movie is blah!blah!blah!
Don't be fooled when I say this movie is shot on film.
Rehman..but its not fair to judge A r rehman with this movie because the music of a movie is to an extent influenced by the story and acting.......I wonder how someone like Ajith can ever be called an actor.....his dialogue delivery is pathetic and its better i don't mention his facial expressions......you'd do yourself a favour by not watching this movie...or rather watch it and educate others on how these kinda movies humiliate the once-enchanting Tamil film industry...Also....i beg the filmmakers not to cast people who are stone heads when it comes to dancing in roles that are supposed to highlight it.....For crying out loud, Ajith can't even dance to those funny dappankuthu songs...how can one tolerate him DANCING BHARATHANATYAM......the thought of him donning the role of a classical dancer would make good dancers of yesteryears turn in their graves.....And watch out for the scenes where Ajith is supposed to be projecting an effeminate side.....Its official ...he's the worst(or is there a worser term for that) thing that can happen to Tamil cinema.........
Then one day, when his resolve reaches its lowest, he is contacted by a powerful sensei from Japan who tells him he must travel there and learn the art of the ninja from him.
He's charming, confident, light-hearted and may even mean some of those endearments and pledges he whispers, at least when he's whispering them.
A reputation can be extraordinarily fragile when upper-class gossips start whispering together.
He was 33 when he made this film.
Lousy story.. frivolous characters.. sudden duets.. all of these leave the viewer wondering when the movie is going to end, and not how.
This gives rise to a bet by his fellow soldiers with him, when the soldiers reach their barracks, that this time he will not be able to seduce this woman.
The high point of his fortunes is reached when, practically on bended knee, he protests to her that he does not love her for only a few days or a few weeks but for his whole life.
She is on the point of yielding to his entreaties when she learns of the bet.
The plot twists and turns when Lyndon is sent to a mental hospital to be treated for neurosis and hallucinations under the care of a villainous psychiatrist (Charles Arnt).
The funniest scene in the movie is when Jimmy is talking to his friend, the Doc, and his buddy is trying to tell him something.
Why would the one guy make a gun noise and gesture when telling everybody the two children should have taken the undersea gun with them.
Paul Cartwright becomes weary when his mother starts dating again, one year after his fathers tragic death.
Being very protective of his mother Virginia,Sally Eilers,Paul gets very agitated and concerned when she gets engaged to marry a Mr. Brett Curtis, Warren Williams.
Early cinematic psychological study about the mind and it's deepest secrets and how they come to the surface when we least expect them to Which makes the movie "Strange illusions" a unique movie for it's time, 1945, and as far as I know has never been duplicated since.
Judge Cartwright felt that Barrington committed a string of crimes from murder and rape to embezzlement dating back to 1932 when he was married to the former miss.
But she is minding her business in New York, when trouble of another kind falls in her lap.
So, forget everything and discover that life can be "slightly dangerous," when you go looking for it.
So with a new look and a new name she is walking to the New York Star when disaster strikes - she is hit in the head with a bucket of paint.
The film, directed with great comedic style by Wesley Ruggles, feels as fresh today as when it was released.
Her problems start when she is hit by a bucket of paint in front of one of the daily newspapers.
Her troubles start when Bob wants to prove she is Peggy the girl with whom he has fallen in love.
After escaping her small town, a ladder falls on her in New York City - when she comes to, it's assumed she has amnesia (she was deciding on her new name when the ladder came crashing down).
It plays with reality, refuses to adhere to conventions and tells a story that only completely makes sense when you get to the end of it... and in my case its the sort of thing I know I need to see again to get a handle on.
The frightening fact here is that when Pablo and Malena think that their father is helpless in coma, he turns out to be more powerful than he was alive.
He has written a detailed diary including how he tortured the families of communist vanguards when he was young.
Ajith was great during his "mugavari" days when he portrayed such a likable character.
By the title alone, I wasn't expecting much out of it when I saw it in the shelve at the video club...
For me it really grates when the costume department appears to have done no research what so ever!
The costumes the French wear seem reasonably accurate, but when we skip over to the Duke of Buckinghams home in England the English are wearing Disneyland versions of the court fashions of at least ten years later.The Duke of Buckingham himself seems to have invented hair gel and be using it to excess on his most unlikely (for the period) hair style.
My only problem with this movie and others that take place in a European country is that when all else fails, lets give them British accents.
I liked John Rhys-Davies in it, as he is one of my favorite actors, but he must have still been in his Gimli stage when doing it because he came across with that sort of Scottish accent of the dwarf.
Although we're an hour into the 170 minute production before they appear and the movie isn't about them, there's something poignant, amusing and inspiring when we see the aging D'Artagnan, Athos (Christopher Cazenove), Aramis (Alan Corduner) and Porthos (John Rhys-Davies), heavier now, gray, a little slower and often used for comedy relief, answer the call to honor and arms.
The first time you notice that something is wrong is when we get our first closeup of our heroine.
Since most part of the movie is shot when Ajith was during the period of reducing his weight, his looks are not same throughout the movie.
I was sufficiently hooked to bother to video-tape the following one when I knew I was going to be out... and bother to watch it immediately I got back, an accolade if ever there was one!
I was scared a little when the mummies were chasing Eddie and his daughter in the crypt for the key, and the spiders crawling all over the crypt door freaked me out a little!
ALSO, when Terrence Stamp summoned Satan up from hell (I think that's who it was, it was a demon or devil made of fire), that part was also scary somewhat.
And when Vishnu professes to remember nothing of what he had done, the father takes him to a psychiatrist.With 'Varalaru' Ajit has bounced back with a vengeance and re-established his credentials as an actor who can deliver if given the right role and projected suitably.Then appears Jeeva, Vishnu's look-alike, and the cause of Vishnu's woes.
I had high hopes for this movie considering what a big deal the box office made this movie into but when I watched it for the first time, not even half way through the movie I was so disappointed in it.
I was so excited when the previews for this movie came out...I simply had to see it.
It was painfully obvious that she, nor could anyone else in this movie with possibly the exception of Terence Stamp, hold anywhere near the court that Nathaniel Parker did when called to be entrancing and tragic...she just was not believable.
I was really looking forward to see this film, The Haunted Mansion was my favourite Disney-attraction, when I visited Eurodisney a few years ago.
And when Vishnu professes to remember nothing of what he had done, the father takes him to a psychiatrist.With 'Varalaru' Ajit has bounced back with a vengeance and re-established his credentials as an actor who can deliver if given the right role and projected suitably.
Or well, maybe it's just because this would be the type of movie that I would had liked to have seen when I was young(er).
Of course when you start watching this movie as an adult you'll notice the movie its weak and quite formulaic story.
And I was psyched that there's going be a movie based on the ride (after seeing the trailer), and I when to see it with my Mom; and after that I love it!
The film starts when husband-and -wife realtors Jim and Sara Evers, with their children Michael and Megan, visit to Gracey Manor; after Sara received a phone call that the owner is selling the house, and workaholic Jim thinks it's a "golden opportunity" for their real estate business.
When weird things start to happen around the house, it seems that Jim must save his family from certain disaster when some of the ghost mistake his wife for another woman who already passed on.
The story is of a typical workaholic dad who neglects his family and decides to take them away to make up for this, but when he receives a call asking him to sell a mansion he can't refuse so off he and his family go.
When I saw this movie for the first time, I was amazed by what a good job they did, and when it was over, I want to see it again.
I think that "The Other Me" was an amazingly humorous movie and I recommend that when you get a chance to watch it you do.
The opening title card of this short drama informs us that it was "founded upon an actual occurrence in New York City," and this information has the same impact it has today when a movie or TV show announces up top that it's based on a true story: everything that follows is granted additional weight by our knowledge that what we're seeing, or something close to it, really happened.
Though not specified, Mendelsohn uses enough period cars, props and costumes to peg the period to the mid 1980's which is undoubtedly a recreation of the period when he lived on Long Island.
This was sometimes very effective, when Mendelsohn used high contrast lighting, especially in some of the eclipse scenes.
In my opinion, the most important scene was when Lady Kiely offers herself to Sharpe, and he refuses in a very honourable manner - I can't see James Bond doing that, can you?
However when Lord Kiely learns that his wife is pregnant and that Jaunita is actually a French spy in the pay of General Loup, he quickly reorganises his loyalties and tries to rally his men back into order, but thanks to the lies regarding the British atrocities (spread by Juanita of course) many of them are now secretly working for the French against the British and are ready to turn on Sharpe in the heat of Battle, and help Loup organise the kidnap of Lady Keily.
Sharpe's fight with Loup is excellent, although I do agree with another review I read somewhere here in that the expressions of the characters when they hate each other has echoes of lust as well.
I really enjoyed seeing this movie.It's more enjoyable to watch a movie when it has a good cast.The cast consists of actors like:Olivier Gruner,Rebecca Staab,Judson Mills,Randy Travis,and more.It's a good super action movie.I also recommend you see Militia,& Missing In Action.
It's just disappointing when the worst performance in an unambitious action movie comes from a supposedly competent big name, and the best from a martial artist for whom English is a second (or third, for all I know) language.
In the book, when they discover her floating corpse, they at first think it is Molly Â which leads to the conclusion that the murderer might have been mistaken, too.
She probably blackmailed Tim off-screen when he was "returning the knife".
It would be really interesting to see if ITV can produce something as good as this when it comes around to it, will also be interesting to see who will be starring as Miss Marple.
Rex is eventually accused of being a type of agent for a country or organization due to his ability to be in places at times when there is no other explanation to how he would have known Speed was in trouble.
i first saw this when i was around seven and enjoyed hearing the catchy opening.
I noticed that when I acquired the Scooby Doo Dynomutt Hour on DVD, they only had the episodes from the 1976 season.
It all begins when he and his chick hail a taxi, start busying it up in the backseat, annoying the driver.
So she's now freakin' over what happened and when she threatens to go to the police, homeboy strangles her and keeps her body in his bedroom.
The irritable cab driver tosses them out when they start making out in the back of his taxi.
With his sanity barely in check as it is (notice the loud, ticking clock sound a la REPULSION, an obvious influence), Marcos finally snaps when a lecherous taxi driver attacks him and his girlfriend Paola (Emma Cohen).
The closest thing to that is found to be a coincidence and even upsets the main character when he realizes what was in his soup.
In the end it's not just a great comedy, it actually manages to deliver something that can be called "a message", when, after main character Dante has survived possibly the worst day in his life, he has to admit that it wasn't all just bad luck but also a broad hint that he could/should change his life as a clerk.
Jay is a pot head looking for two things in life, drugs and the ladies Silent Bob hardly talks at all but when he does it's normally heart warming and inspirational.
Wait screw that who needs heart warming when you got Randal, snowballing, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob, and of course Randal.
It's just cool to see how one persons life can be ripped to pieces when: your boss lies to you, your ex-girlfriend is "getting married" your best friend shows up late for work as usual, and you have to come in on your day off, among an array of other things I don't want to spoil.
PLEASE trust me, when you get it you will be justified in feeling a little smug for you will be stupid no-more.
I remember when I first bought the season 2 DVD set and watched the episodes in sequence.
Oh no no no, this is one fast talking, twisted and very entertaining movie, but one that can only be appreciated when one can lower his/her inhibitions.
Back in 94 when Kevin Smith made Clerks, he had a brilliant plan.
is a modern classic that struck at a time when the age bracket didn't have a voice.
Not even the directing is that good in this movie, but I think I speak for all Smith fans when I say that we are willing to forget and forgive most of this when it comes to clerks.
It's really hard to count this as a definite flaw when it does so much for the movie, but at the same time it is obvious that cons of the dialogue: (A)covering too much essential material too briefly (B)statements that are too long and elaborate for the given actors to do them justice (C)unrealistic detail and stream of conscious in the character's statements; out-weigh the positive aspects: (A)humorous anecdotes and tangents expressed through tirades (B)unique character interaction.
And she explains that when she "does it" it means more than when she goes down and that is supposed to make him feel better.
There are dozens of other scenes similar in nature that are so humourous yet painfully honest that you laugh but when the giggles subside, you realize that it is so true.
Dante's always a little timid when it comes to dealing with the unruly customers, but when Randal takes the stage, it's a lot funnier.
will always stay as it was when it was released 10 years ago-revolutionary.
Why claim ultra-budget movies as being the "best film ever" when you can see some guys with almost no scenary and a very low budget make a great movie that is intelligent, funny, has a good soundtrack AND is well done at the same time?
The last scene was good, was scary when Scully saw Duane in the window.
Honestly when I first started the watching the movie, I thought it was a Showtime series and not a movie.
We as people dismiss our feelings of jealousy as being acceptable but when push comes to shove, you have to be a winner at heart and meticulously trained.
I was pleasantly surprised when I caught this film on the IFC today, well written, snappy and real dialog, as well as relevant.
Their lives are not turning out as they had imagined when graduating college.
It also shows us that no one can be a "loser" when they have good friends, people they love and care about and can have fun with.
Though their weekly dinners could put the men's movement back a bit as "Elliott" becomes increasingly lacerating in criticizing his friends' lives, that disruptive nastiness becomes an equalizing set-up when the only alpha male from their group, in a sympathetic three-dimensional performance by Boyd Gaines such that Jerry Bruckheimer should be very grateful this is his alter-ego, comes back to visit the old neighborhood with his own existential crisis.
But when the chips are down, it's Elliot who comes through as a real mensch, a good guy in the most important ways, and the film leaves you with the sense that in every important respect Elliot is not "second best" at all.
Then later, she abruptly changes her mind and tells Mulder not to feed into Duane's psychosis when Mulder says he believes him.
Later, Matt teams up with the sheriff, but their alliance is short-lived when Duncan drops the lawman with both barrels of his double-barreled shotgun and Hollis drill him once for good measure.
Remember the days when Joe Namath was a sex symbol?
It would be another four years before he was able to convince someone to cast him in drama and RKO got a genuine hit in Murder My Sweet when they did.
It's funny, in an offbeat sort of way, there's not a lot of dialog... and i really must insist, if you do happen to find a copy of this film watch it in french with subtitles (i swear you lose so much from films when you watch it in the dubbed version) I'd give it 8 out of ten, because i came out of the cinema with a smile on my face thinking 'what the?'
I was reluctant to see it at first, but when I did, it completely blew my mind - the acting, the directing, the writing, the cinematography - perfect!
His character when from shy to aggressive in the blink of an eye.
Unfortunately afterwards some certain slack in the intrigue starts to show up when the authors tend to delay obvious revelations and artificially hold up things from happening.
For anyone who knows anything about show business from way back when - and I'm talking about the great Vaudeville stars of the 20's and 30's, this is a nostalgic mind-blower.
Combining drama and theater with historical footage, this film brings to life the tumultuous times when working people in America made a great leap forward.
Imagine my surprise when he put in a splendid effort in a serious way!
Yes, there was "sex", as you would imagine would happen when there is nudity.
Occasionally he would appear in the movie and laugh at you for watching, when he wasn't whipping the required lesbian maid.
Nuda per Satana, or Nude for Satan as it's more commonly known amongst English speaking audiences, starts late one night deep in the Italian countryside with Dr. William Benson (Stelio Candelli) on an emergency call when he is involved in a car accident, the owner of the other car is a woman named Susan Smith (Rita Calderoni) whom seems unconscious.
Nuda per Satana in my opinion isn't a film, it's a collection of strange imagery that makes no sense when put together.
It does however remind me of the movie "Carnival of Souls" in a way that the driver of the vehicle was not supposed to have dies in a crash when he had almost hit a silhouette figure in a white nightgown off the road and soon after a lady had also had an unfortunate accident with a far lesser fate than his.
The lights in the house go out when he calls for help, but the front door is open so he wanders in to find the house seemingly abandoned & full of debris.
As always, too, nonsensical quotes from some ancient tome prove the key to the whole mysteryÂwhich, when uttered by the hero, causes a skull to explode(!
A doctor and a young lady(beautiful Rita Calderoni)have just been involved in a car accident.The doctor leaves the girl at the accident scene,and runs off to a spooky castle for help.He enters the castle,and finds that it's inhabited by some laughing ghoul(most likely Satan himself).Later,the young lady goes looking for the doctor,and eventually finds her way to the same castle.However when they meet again,they find that they haven't met each other,they have meet their doppelgangers.Luigi Batzella's "Nude for Satan" is a great piece of sleazy trash.The special effects are jaw-droppingly awful(a monster spider especially comes to my mind!
Sure, as a kid I knew him only from The Match Game, but when I saw "Life of Reilly (Save It for the Stage)" last fall I understood at last what a fascinating person and enormous heart lay behind the outrageous public persona.
Having been a fan of all things ridiculous from a very young age, I couldn't believe my eyes when one evening a friend and I sat down to watch some trashy horror rubbish and what greeted us was this.
The two get separated, and William ends up getting distracted by Evelyn, a dead ringer for the car-crash woman who dresses in period clothing (when she's not nude for Satan), calls him Peter, and is hot for his bod.
Both William and Susan are fairly creeped out by the goings-on in the castle, but don't really start trying to figure things out or get away until they meet back up when Susan is menaced by a giant, and apparently quite horny, spider.
And the clincher comes at the end, when Peter and Susalyn exactly mirror Frank and Columbia's little frolic on the throne in RHPS's ballroom scene, immediately followed by what could certainly be called a "floor show."
I'm actually a racing driver, so i know what 150mph looks like and when he's on the Champs Elysee he's certainly close to that speed - 5 gear and max revs.
For example at around 05:40, when he is forced to pass a parked truck slowly.
Having experienced a similar drive through the streets of Sydney back in the 1960s (in a then just released Mini Cooper S) I know how fast one seems to be traveling when close to road level.
This is the true genius of Rendezvous: It appeals to so many by the action on screen, that it displays profound thinking that you never expect to find when you look deep into it's soul.
They do take on serious subjects, but always bail out when it comes to quality acting and directing, and then go for the "Men are Evil" conclusion.
I knew who Charles Nelson Reilly was from the old game shows on TV when I was a kid.
I am even in the class room scene...I am the girl that looks up at the clock when the bell rings...hehehe!
I first watched this movie when I was like 12.
It made my stomach turn when Coach Nash was in jail for raping her and he asks someone to give her a love letter.
I am married to an older man, but I was already in my late 20s when it started.
He should of backed away when she said she wanted it over.
Sometimes I'm a sucker for a romantic movie, more rarely, when the black mood takes me, I want to rip out the protagonists innards and dance on them.
I finished watching this movie which I'd started watching a few days ago, back when I was of the opinion that romantic movies were just lovely.
The movie begins when Lawrence (Joseph Fiennes) takes a psycological session where he talk about he, his two friends and a person that they have in common.
How will react when she know the truth???
Damaged Care is an excellent, must see movie which centers around the state of ethics in medical care and what happens when corporations get involved in medical decision making and make the bottom line take precedence over sound medical care.
I was particularly charmed by Laurence's description of the "perfect woman" and even more charmed when (as if I might have missed it) it was replayed!
It is artistically directed and edited, intelligently written, and well acted (except when Monica Potter seemed to sound like Julia Roberts -- I can't imagine why she would want to do that).
The time when Beatlemania is everywhere, it was not ignored in the TV movie as well.
What I would like to know is when is he making a Sequel?  
it ends just when the Beatles finally go to the States.
It did capture very well the atmosphere of the time, when Britain emerged from monochrome into colour during the late 50's and early 60's.
I am trying to complete my ten lines but is does get difficult when has said all one wants to say, is that enough yet?
I didn't even know Laura Dern existed until 6 month ago when I saw "Wild At Heart".
But he didn't come up with calling it Fields not Field until 1967 when he wrote the song.
Then he kills the national geographic lion and when he stabs it is paper mache.
Everybody freaks out when a nearby volcano erupts and Vuud is around when a chunk of steel is vomited out of the mountain in the shape of a sword.
The movie's main weakness is the heavy-handedness of everything, with morals being pitched left and right when the movie is really too low budget and silly to be taken seriously.
I highly recommend this film as it changed my life when I saw it as a boy!
Saw this film when it came out, more than a quarter century ago.
Then when I married I discovered to my horror that my wife also had five sisters, all unmarried and all expecting my support.
This clever, exciting adventure did only modest business when it was released, and was quickly forgotten by most.
I think the part of Cramer (Anthony Perkins) was played brilliantly with special focus on the "flip outs" that he performs when he begins to realise that his master plan isn't exactly going to plan.
First, the James Bond star sports a thick beard, knits when thinking, and refuse to be proved wrong.
Best of all is the humor which is knowing and right on target, as when ffolkes becomes flustered when trying to warm up what he thinks is a young man .
I hadn't seen this for a few years, so I enjoyed watching it again last week when it got a screening on TV.
It has a real deadpan pacing and a lovely dark edge, but when it came to the redemption it didn't seem t forced.
it is not anywhere near an accurate picture of an individual's fall into insanity; it is not thought-provoking; it is not Hitchcockian in any way; & turns into a farce when the main character either physically or unconsciously supposedly travels to Hong Kong, where he repeatedly rides the ferry between Hong Kong-to-Kowloon "as if" searching for "something"?
An outstanding example of what a film maker can accomplish with great material, charming actors, and a cinematographer who knows how to shoot a picture, even when you're dealing with a limited budget.
This film is full of gun humor without being overtly violent, and yet when it does pull the violence trigger, usually gets laughs instead of blood.
It's a shame that most people won't sit through anything black and white anymore because in many respects this earlier production - which doesn't even show up in the IMDb listings when you put "Peter Pan" into the search engine!
Now when I put the 1960 color version on it looks garish in comparison.
Having seen no trailers or anything apart from the usual blurb on cinema leaflets I was fully expecting a humorous film when we went to see Disturbia.
Kale sees his father die in an horrific way and one in which he himself nearly dies too, but the scars won't heal and he goes off the rails, and when he attacks a school teacher he is placed on house arrest.
All hell broke lose when he began to suspect that his neighbor is a serial killer.
Kale becomes a recluse, and attacks his teacher when the man mentions his father, which I believe was a completely justified action given Kale's strong connection with his father and presence when he was dead...
The end of the death scene proved forever and all time Shia's acting skill, because when he sees his dad's dead body his expression conveys the fact that he's dead with no need to show the body at all, that takes skill...  Short hand, Kale spies on people, one particularly hot chick is his focus for a while, but later he turns into a sleuth trying to catch a killer Kale is a nonconformist, that fact likely added to my liking the film...
He shaves it off anyway, but when he sees his wife, she doesn't notice, neither do their friends at dinner that night, neither do his co-workers.
Why can't I see Alfred Hitchcocks' name when I type Disturbia in IMDb??
Credit Caruso for showing restraint for everything and leading us along by uncovering pieces of the story only when we need to know them.
He is good as the conflicted heavy who does wrong only when the world around him has forced him to, (like in Dancer in the Dark and Down in the Valley), but he is perfect as the all out creepy, sly-smiling force being accused of kidnapping and killing numerous women.
First of all, it is boring, the prelude is too long when literally nothing happens.
But he's in luck when a hot young girl moves next door, they quickly develop a peeping tom type of relationship, they spy on the neighbors, but when they see the neighbor across the street on a date, but the date "never leaves the house" and they want to prove him as a cold hearted murderer, but is he?
This occurs when the lead, on a whim, shaves off his mustache.
Oddly, when confronted, they have no recollection that he had one, even though the audience saw he had one and saw pictures of the man with the mustache!
At first, I thought I'd missed something when the film ended--there were just too many dangling plot points and things that just confused me.
Things begin to get frightening when he begins to suspect one of his neighbours is a serial killer.
I actually felt the adrenaline rush that the characters in the film must have been feeling when they were snooping around in the neighbour's garage.
I was actually shocked when I left the theatre over how good this movie really was.
It leads me to wonder why Hollywood continues to pump out absolute garbage like the Saw trilogy, Hostel, and Dead Silence when they could be making movies like this instead.
And then Shannon Doherty as Rene, first of all she really didn't seem thrilled to be in this movie, she never hung around the set, she would take off when she was done working.
I believe it did pay for itself and probably profit when you include video rental where it was more popular than in theaters.
Now when you take all of this into consideration, you see how great this film could have been.
I really loved it when he just lashed out at those who could see the sailboat while he couldn't.
If not for the preoccupation with superhero sex organs, supermans potential birth control or possible future realistic child bearing partners, then just simply for the answer to what noises do you make when you're having whoopee.
The film came out when I was fourteen, and I went to see it with my cousin at the local mall after a rousing bus trip.
Smith tried outdoing himself here, but sometimes it doesn't work and it seems more conventional than his other films, but that doesn't stop this from being alluringly amusing and satisfying when you comes to the ending credits.
But I can imagine that the film looses some of its appeal when you are not familiar with the Marvel and DC comic heroes and the strange passion (and science) of collecting comic books.
I am one of the handful of people who actually purchased "An Evening With Wild Man Fischer" when it was originally released in the late 60s.
When he has his paranoid schizophrenia in check he loses his 'pep' as he calls it, his ability to create and perform, so the irony is that when he loses his mental disorder, he loses his art.
There were moments in the film where I almost felt tears swell up, and there were moments when I got shivers watching Wild Man perform.
All I can say about this movie is WTF the concept is the same as your Blair Witch,Paranormal Activity and so on but somewhere between the halfway point of the movie its almost as the director lost all his sense of thinking and drops a twist which makes you go huh,and then about another 45 minutes or so later when you see the ending credits that is when you will have the reaction WHAT THE F***.
Then he _keeps on_ going back and forth across the ferry until the end of the day when it closes.
The moustache being present is the catalyst to get him back to timeline B, and when he gets back to his hotel his wife his there, and it is as if she has been there the whole time, with him, on vacation.
I wasn't sure what to expect when I watched this film.
The premise is this: a nice ordinary family in a rural town are heartbroken when their 15 year old daughter drowns at a family picnic.
Its all the typical restless ghost haunting a house story but damn is it effective... and even better, half way into the movie the ghost thing gets dropped when some rather earthly explanations start to surface and the family looks deeper into the last weeks of her daughters life.
Its all driving serpentine and when you think this is just a psychological movie it takes another turn back to the ghost story.
i loved that when agnÃ©s showed up, marc didn't try to argue about anything, he just went with the flow b/c he was so happy to have her back.
but he finally puts the past behind him when he tosses the postcard in the water.
much like seeing an excellent live show, when the band is in their groove and the audience is right with them.
We all know what happens in cartoons when cats try to catch mice, but what happens when the mice want the cat to eat them?
The funny stuff comes when the two crawl into the big (and stupid) Claude the cat's mouth....but cat wakes up and thinks all of this is too good to be true, or a dream, and spits them out.
ANYWAY on to the movie: This takes place supposedly in the 50's or early 60's, and it seems to waver between when it wants to be as it talks about seeing Invasion of the Body Snatchers and then mentions a roomful of people as looking like the casting room for 'Psycho'.
The world wasn't quite campy enough for that tagline when this film premiered.
Reality starts when he's sitting in the boat with the red shirt, bearded and eating noodles...  Post card incident is a trick a big trick, its shown him sitting in a hotel window writing to his wife, well if this takes place in his dreams then in reality while he is with his wife later after saying goodbye to their recent friends how could he have the card???
Korman starts leaving when he realizes what his indignation almost cause happen.
The series was (allegedly) not as well received in the US as it was by the crazy British audience who adored it and were distraught when it ended so abruptly.
The script by Robert Sabaroff was based on the novel 'The Seventh' by Donald E. Westlake can be divided into three chunks, the first third of the film revolves around the recruiting of the team with some fun set-pieces to make sure each member is up to the task, the second third of the film is my favourite when they carry out the heist & there's that feeling that you root for them & you want to get away with it & all the close calls they have & watching the plan unfold is pretty fun, then the final third of the film is perhaps the weakest as several random events come together & tear the thieves apart & it becomes a rather dull runaround after the money which goes missing through no fault of their own but does obviously cause problems as they don't know who to trust.
Then there's the ending when everyone gets shot & it just all seems rather pointless.
The Split was apparently the first film to be given an 'R' rating by the MPAA thanks to some fun fights, a few shoot-outs, a bit of mild bad language (although the 'N' word is used here in a casual fashion, something unthinkable these days especially when the IMDb flags it as a 'Prohibited Word' as I have just found out...) & a bit of blood.
Maybe THE SPLIT felt too calculated to Maltin, but to me, it represents the era when Hollywood entertainment still managed to assuredly deliver the authentic exploitation of a formula.
Even during the 'conversion' it looked just like the way DeFazio used to behave when she felt defeated.
Her getup and behaviour of a fallen woman was amusing also when you think of all the dear ladies who have appeared in MTV videos and all that "breakthrough" business Madonna pulled back in the eighties and nineties.
Again in the conversion, I couldn't help but think of Reverend Lovejoy on the Simpsons when Walter Huston began praying.
Others, like RAIN, seem pretty silly when viewed decades later.
Please,...this seems less like real people but more like broad caricatures--which, when you watch this hoary (it means "old", not "trampy" once again) film, that's about all you get.
In the scene when he starts reciting the Our Father, he is higher up on the stairs, and when Sadie kneels down at the bottom of the stairs and begins praying, it looks like she is praying at him.
It's apparently what happens when you take a neat starting idea (a man shaves off his mustache, and everyone seems not to notice, then they claim he never had one), and then you become more interested in making yourself look clever than in actually telling a story that bears some relevance on our lives.
In those early days of the talkies, when there was the tendency to deliver filmed theater, they preferred to shoot not the literary sources directly, but stage adaptationsÂlike they did with Dracula in the same span of time.
A total bomb when it first hit in 1932, Rain today holds up rather well for today's audience to enjoy.
Davidson in his probing of Sadie's past comes up with the information, that he psychologically beat out of her, that she was wanted back in the states for prostitution and is awaiting a three year sentence for it when she steps off the boat at the San Farncisco piers.
Sadie is slowly broken down by Davidson's tactics and he really gets to her when he has the Governor of the island, Pago Pago, sign an order to ship her out and back to San Francisco where she awaits a prison cell.
Tim "Handsome" O'Hara, William Gargan, for Sidney Australia and then changing her mind when she's confronted by Davidson.
I feel that W. Somerset Maugham was trying to tell us is that a religious nut like Davidson who put himself up on such a high pedestal of morality that when he as much as got a thought of what he would consider to be sinful that it burst his whole balloon of holy self-righteous.
Two of the best scenes are when Huston repeatedly says the Lord's Prayer as Crawford becomes mesmerised and starts saying it herself and Huston's final scene as he says a silent prayer to himself before he changes his expression to one in which he seems about to lose self-control before he rushes to where Crawford resides.
I wanted to see her when she was young and didn't look like a man in drag, as I perceived her in later movies (maybe it all those padded shoulders of her dresses and coats, emphasizing her mannish looks?).
However, the intriguing aspect for me is this: just when did Sadie figure out how to get Davidson off her back and out of her life?
Was it when he was monotonously reciting The Lord's Prayer over and over again, or did she have a brilliant brainwave when he finally succumbed to all that she stood for, in his eyes, as a prostitute?
You've got to admire Milestone for coaxing a sensitive performance out of Crawford, a woman who was happier when hamming it up.
But his work was better when he had the leisure to write descriptions of characters and their behavior, or of the settings of his stories.
I cannot say that it is the best of all possible adaptations; a tacked-on sub-plot (involving a romance with an amorous quartermaster) helps the exposition but dilutes the icy cynicism of the basic story, the missionary and his wife are clumsy caricatures of hellfire and brimstone puritanism, while Joan Crawford's "low-class" accent is more irritating than it is believable -- one is relieved when she forgets to use it.
Crawford's face is also a focus: from her initial "good-time gal" flirting with the sailors to the incredible sequence where she (apparently) converts, she leers, pouts, weeps, and more importantly, knows when to stop, in the three scenes she appears (seemingly) without makeup.
When Kibbee talks about the reformers triumphing (and you have to get the sneer in his voice when he says reformers)he's talking about their greatest triumph, the 18th amendment.
The soldier cannot believe the transformation in Sadie when he gets out of the brig.
And it must fairly be said that when she was a young (I think she's about 25 when she made this) she is a strikingly beautiful babe, heavy make-up or not.
Set in an old large London house, for the early parts of the film the kids of left alone to be kids, but the films gets interesting when Charlie Hook played by Dirk Bogarde turns up.
As a child my daughter was traumatized when I took her to see 'Cement Garden' and she still reminds me that it damaged her psyche.
Clayton manages to bring in an incestuous undertone without overtly showing any incest - in the days when directors needed to adhere to certain codes, they called upon their imaginations.
It may have been a happy accident, a lucky moment during one of the takes, but the editor would have flipped when he saw how perfect it was.
The film, when you look at it closely, is, in fact, quite good.
Marc, of course, is getting more & more agitated & Agnes drugs him when he goes to lie down for a while...Marc comes to just in time to hear Agnes & his boss, Bruno, talking about "the men in the white coats" that are coming to take Marc away, and using all his conscience strength to dress himself & make ready, he manages to bolt & impulsively takes a flight to Hong Kong, where he rides the ferries and wanders, eventually taking a room.
Definitely worth seeing, when you get the opportunity to.
Eight children whose mother's just passed away want to go on with their life as if nothing happened.Besides ,they do believe that their mother is still with them,and Pamela Franklin 's rendering is absolutely stunning when she acts as some kind of medium:far from the usual clichÃ©s -as you can see in "ghost" for instance-,she will give you goose pimples.This mother will remain a mystery,maybe a saint steeped in piety,maybe somebody much worse than a goody-two-shoes,as Charlie eventually claims.
Charlie is masterfully portrayed by Dirk Bogarde who was in his more fruitful period with such masterpieces as "accident" "king and country" "la caduti dei degi" "morte a Venezio".He keeps people waiting for he only appears after about forty minutes.But when he's on the screen ,the chemistry between the thespian and the children is so obvious that there's no hiatus.At first sight,he resembles some adult Peter Pan (hairdo,swagger,clothes,not to forget the name:Hook!
).Here ,where Spielberg dismally failed when he made "Hook" ,Jack Clayton with a much smaller budget had already succeeded in portraying an adult/child, more than twenty years before.But further acquaintance will show that an adult can no longer remain a child .When Charlie is a man again,tragedy is waiting around the corner.
Needless to say, I wasn't allowed to watch the film until I was much older than when I was in it.
I saw this not-well-known movie when I was a little child.
As expectable with children these age (ranging from, I'd guess, ages 3 to 12), they create their rituals (the German translation of the title is `Every evening at 9 o'clock') and manage to find a way to keep in touch with their world `before' Â when the beloved mother was still live.
They seem to manage pretty well, but things turn out ugly when the rambling, long lost "father" returns to take over the household.
Hence, when Marc stares into the darkness, is it truly reality?
And, just when Marc leaves to go to work, Agnes calls him back and says: "Marc Â this is like a bad trip!"
Things got confusing to me when he didn't press his wife about the Bali photographs (which appear to confirm he's NOT crazy), his wife is apparently trying to have him committed and he suddenly escapes to Hong Kong.
Think Identity only the personalities do not die when they are killed, all these people are in his head with the exception of the nurses who are indeed real(paranoid schizophrenia), one personality Doctor Eck knows it enough to diagnose it, but the personality called Dr. Ek has an ulterior motive, aka the book of magik, therefore Trevor has no reason to believe that any of the people are not real.
Make sure to be awake when you watch!
The film has a certain insecure tension -- just when you think you're putting it together, Kasten throws in another piece of the puzzle and you have to re-think what you thought you knew.
Mindfu@k movies can be good, when they have a point to them (ie.
The scenes at his apartment where Holmes figures out why they need to go to America, the scene where Pettibone is getting on the plane and when abducted on the train are well done and entertaining.
But this was wartime and it would only be natural that world's most famous detective be called on to lend his services overseas when a British agent carrying a vital document disappears, but not before he passes it on to an unsuspecting Marjorie Lord on a train.
And that's the interesting part, because when you are defining your nature, you have the choice by defining it against others.
It was very amusing stuff when Holmes smashed the vase and he tries to convince that it is worth nothing and he says "Now now my good man" in a really funny high pitched voice.
Holmes and Pettibone had worked together before on important cases so Holmes is ready to take on the task and travel with Watson to Washington when the British authorities tell him that his associate has disappeared, along with the document.
I am not going to compare this to prison flicks but when it comes to gang flicks it rates way higher than "Colors" or others that I cant think of by name.
I actually went to the theater to see this when it first came out and was surprised to see that it was filmed in a very familiar location, The Biltmore House in Asheville, N.C. Don Knotts is the overbearing lead detective as Tim Conway is the clumsy assistant trying to solve a homicide at the huge mansion.
Saw this in the theater when I was young and went back the very next day to see it again.
One scary part for kids younger than 6 or so, if you want to censor it, have your kids leave the room when they go outside to dig up the body.
A true estimation of their talents was quoted early on in the movie when the gas station owner said, "Those are two 'idiots' what'll make their mark where ever they go.
I was just watching a bunch of people talking about the Andy Griffith Show ans the Don Knotts Barney Fife character and immediately, I thought about this film and one scene that still makes me laugh out loud when I think of it.
And when that unfortunate bird walks in loopy circles, if you don't laugh until your sides hurt or tears run down your face when you see it, you must have no soul so i don't want to know you.
So while AgnÃ¨s leaves the apartment for a short time to do some shopping, Marc takes the risk and cuts off his beloved moustache, just like that, in order to see his lover's face and analyze her reaction when she returns home.
This question mark is totally appropriate, since it clearly illustrates what kind of movie 'La Moustache' really is: namely a confusing, puzzling drama with an open ending and a number of unexplainable twists, flashbacks and mysterious appearances by characters when you least expect it.
I saw this movie for the first time when I was eight years old, and loved it from the start.
Even when it's not that funny, it's sure to be awesome.
Joseph Sargent handles the scenery and actors with far more intelligence and grace than Simon Wincer, who proved his woeful inadequacies when he returned for the prequel "Comanche Moon" last year.
First, when it comes to the books I think most people think Lonesome Dove is a better book.
Call is now older but no wiser in the ways of the world and when he's hired to track down a Mexican Bandit named Joey Garza.
It always bothered me when Siskel & Ebert & Roeper, et al.
Streets of Laredo obviously has a great deal to live up to and, when viewed or read in conjunction with Dove, it does suffer in the sense that our familiarity is slightly snubbed.
And when mention of force is made it is downplayed by noting how most of those conquered saw little change in their daily routine and were happy to have new rulers.
The narrator waxes admiringly about how the Muslims were using paper when Europe was still using parchment.
I didn't even care that when the plane wrecked and burst into a giant fireball, everybody on board would die a bloody screaming death.
I think this is the greatest Star Trek nay sci-fi series ever made, and when it ended, I was left with an overwhelming sense of loss.
Neither of these were likely to occur when they were sending him to the MOST important place in the quadrant at that time - DS9.
They kind of address this a tiny bit later on by Sisko threatening Quark to do his bidding because they let him operate for free, but he never says "free services for the crew" and there are times when they make payments on quark's thumbpad so money is being exchanged.
Why pay for food when you can get it for free in your room?
Sure, the Law (StarFleet) reigns supreme, but when you're on the frontier, things aren't always black and white.
It's only because when I saw this flick I was a young teen who thought Jan Michael was cool (I had a haircut like him, and later I came darn close to buying a bar by Clark AB in the PI called the Airwolf Bar because the chicks there said I looked like him, oh my was I stoned cold drunk that time).
So all you people who are giving this flick 1 star, obviously you never saw the flick in the 70's when I did, with its very cool post apocalyptic scenes and its very cool RV that had missiles and could go over oceans in raging gales, and Jan Michael, and of course one of those lines you can't get iota your head, George Peppard screaming "We Got Us Some Killa Cockroaches Here!".
During her dream, she imagined an American Indian beau (played by Cornell Wilde) and when she awoke, he was real and pursued her rabidly.
I was so excited when I saw that this movie was being made because I had enjoyed the short story so much and then to see how Hollywood butchered it.
One night, when I had nothing better to do, I decided to watch "Damnation Alley".
When watching remember it was 1977, not 1997 when it was made.
My wife hates this film so much she makes me change the channel when ever its on.
One revolting sequence involving blood-sucking cockroaches might have become a classic among splatter aficionados had the special effects budget been larger (when the roaches, en masse, chase Jan-Michael Vincent on his cycle, it looks like a carpet being pulled along by a wire).
In as much as I am very much impressed with visual items such as cinematography, special effects, contrasts, colors, etc., when it comes to movies, this is a big letdown.
I remember this movie from tv when I was a kid.
And then when they needed to repair these state of the art "RV's", they happen to be on top of "what's left of Detroit" and find a replacement rear end in a junkyard.
It isn't the worst science, but it is hard to swallow that suddenly the radiation level falls for these certain characters when it needs to.
This was made in the dorky day of the Steve McQueens, when each hero had to have a vehicle fetish that only the reddest necks can identify with.
One scene that is well done and worth noting is when the crew is overtaken by a deadly breed of cockroaches.
some people don't like the ending, but I for one thought it is just fine, when you consider other movies like The Day After Tomorrow (2004) the ending is fine.
3) The weather effects were unbelievable for when it was filmed (1977 -- no computers were injured in the making of this film!)
Jan Michael Vincent before he became famous with air-wolf the wisecracking Token black guy Paul Winfield, who suffers a fate worse than death when runs afoul of 'said Killa cockroaches' French actress Dominque Sanda as a Vegas show girl along for the ride and a Pre -breaking away Jackie Earle Haley as a waif who is adept at throwing rocks at disgruntled hillbillies!
Seems that the two of them knew each other years before when she was 6.
When early on one of the original four members of the expedition (Kip Niven) dies it's acknowledged in about 15 seconds; when a second crew member (Paul Winfield) gets eaten by giant scorpions (which look more like beetles) it isn't mentioned at all!
I remember seeing this film on late night television when I was a young lad and I instantly loved it for life Â or at least I thought I would at the time.
"Damnation Alley" has a lot of elements to appeal to young and naive audiences, especially 15 to 20 years ago, when computer generated effects didn't dominate cinema yet.
Tanner and Keegan are supposedly best friends (they even sing cheesy songs together), yet when Keegan dies Tanner shows no reaction or doesn't even mention his name anymore for the remainders of the film.
And, just when you presume the film couldn't possibly sink any lower, you're faced with the most implausible and infuriating climax in the history of cinema.
A stogie-chewing George Peppard heads a team that welds together an armored vehicle out of spare parts, taking satisfaction when a plan comes together.... Jan-Michael Vincent mans an AWOL missile-firing government vehicle copiloted by a cranky white-haired guy....
Pretty much the only expression of angst or concern we get is when Jan-Michael puts his head in his hands at the end of the sequence, but his portrayal could serve equally well for some other movie's 50th-billing character Man With Headache.
One of the most legendary one-liners is said when she hears that he takes advantage of bankrupt ("sinking") companies . "
Honestly, despite the crap people here throw on Hook, I've always enjoyed watching this movie when it comes on TV.
I was half asleep when this movie came on Turner Classic Movies this afternoon.
During a visit to his Granny Wendy in London however, his past returns to haunt him when the villainous Captain Hook kidnaps the kids and holds them to ransom.
I was in first grade when I saw it for my birthday and I remember liking it then.
If anyone know how to get this movie please let me know and if it is possible please put it where I can buy it as I would love to see it again and if not please let me know when they show it on T.V so that I can watch it again.
I try to make it a point to watch this movie at least once a year, or when I feel myself getting too cynical.
One of the main points that Barrie stresses in his "Peter Pan" is that childhood is a special time, but eventually there comes a time when everyone (except for Peter Pan) has to stop being a child and assume the responsibilities of adulthood.
t is till the legendary Captian Hook kidnaps Peter's children that he is reminded by Wendy of who he used to be, of course Peter can't believe it, he can't believe it even more when Tinkerbell pays a visit and carries him off to Neverland where he meets Captian Hook after so long.
That is the premise behind Hook, when Captain Hook kidnaps the now adult Peter Pan's children and takes them back to Neverland.
I was actually worried when I saw the casting for Hook, but I watched it anyway.
I had watched the movie when it came out and found it very pleasant and enjoyable and, re-watching it again just recently, I still found it a very good movie   The movie's strong points to me are the scenery and design, the storyline, the music and the quality of acting by most of the cast.
I do understand where many critics are coming from when they say that he has a propensity to go over the top in his acting during some parts of themovie but he's good at portraying both a serious and funny side and I think that makes him the perfect choice for this role.
If you look at it from the idea that she is like a little girl who has never really grown up - but is somewhat frozen in time to back when she was 6 years old, when she first meets her "soul-mate".
The first, say, 25 minutes of "Hook" are brilliant: Williams is a workaholic who has no time for his kids, when they are kidnapped by the villainous Cap'n Hook.
This is when the movie stops being amazing, and becomes just "good".
He made a horrible directing choice when showing the first (non-bird's-eye view)shot of Neverland.
Maybe because this is a film that I truly enjoyed, even though its flaws stuck out a mile when I started writing the review.
I was 10 years old when I first saw this movie (and I was born in 1993), and it was one of my favorites.
The 90's had a lot of very great movies, and I had to watch movies when I reached an age where I'd understand them.
The point is, this is a children's film, and we didn't see those mistakes when we were children because it's designed that way.
I would imagine the writers must have panicked when they got the memo, but they certainly delivered.
I was shocked when I learned Hamill was the Joker.
My parents didn't even believe me when I told them, they thought it must be another actor with the same name!
Just the poster for it feels operatic, and when Bruce Wayne becomes Batman, it truly feels so.
(and don't you just LOVE that veil and halo getup when she ALMOST marries Atherton Huntley??)
The only negatives about the movie would be that the stories are very tight, which causes some scenes to feel rushed and less significant than it should, such as when Bruce first suits up as Batman.
Throughout the film we encounter a beautiful woman name Andrea Beaumont who makes a fool out of Bruce Wayne, and in a flashback of Bruce Wayne, its explained that the woman was the first love of Bruce Wayne, but it tears him apart when Andrea abandons Bruce by leaving with her father to France after in tides with a local mafia.
This was the first Batman cartoon I have seen I first seen it when i was about 5 years old and this is how i got the cartoon batman also staring Kevin Conroy as batman and mark hamill as The Joker.
When your a kid you don't really care about the story you go to see it just because it's Batman, but when your older you can really get involved and begin to sympathize for the character's.
There are great flashbacks but you may be wondering something like "when does the fun begin?"
Definitely when the Joker appears is when the fun and the best part of the movie begin.
Meanwhile the love of Batman's alter ego comes back in his life and the two rekindle their broken romance so the dark knight has to balance his love life and also find out who's responsible for all the murders and clear his name, because when you walk around in a cape and mask you need all the good PR that you can get.
I really love the choir music she plays at the end when Batman is on top of the roof and springs into action after seeing the bat signal.
Batman: Mask of the Phantasm stands on its own feet extremely well, when at least compared to some of the lessor Batman animated movies (Batman vs Dracula anyone?
Even as it was meant originally for TV, the directors Radomski and Timm, through their writer collaborators, have applied a drawing style that is distinctive amongst other cartoons of its ilk from the period: very direct lines and sharp, jagged edges, lots of smoke at (specific) times, the right blend of noir when it comes to revealing the caped crusader when he enters a room in the dead of night.
And, perhaps they're right, but one never knows just what can happen when you see a film.
My winter vacation had already been planned when, one Monday evening in February 1982, I saw "SST: Disaster in the Sky" (one of its other names).
Chasing him around the world are FBI counter-terrorism agents Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Max Archer (Neal McDonough), who are clearly like fish out of water when operating outside their legal jurisdictions.
Without good intelligence, you're always reactive, and it takes a lot to be on top of the game, especially when tactics employed are normally innovately discharged.
traitor has just been released in here..so i have just watched it..i found it on good intentions..especially surprised when i saw Steve martin's name as a writer..Don Cheadle was great..so Said was... but as a Muslim  being in mostly Muslim country(Turkey) i can easily understand there r many people are being used because of their faith..but most of Muslims have normal life..rare of them in those kind, though Islam; as every religion forbids to kill anyone even anything...the first important thing is being human...i know this, i can see this from here..but a European or a Japanese or an American person who has no knowledge or cultur about Islam what does he or she think?i accept as a Muslim we weren't able tell ourselves rightly to whole world but i think if Hollywood or the film makers want to seem pretty to Muslims or to understand and tell the world about real the Muslims, re-sit and re-think...when they r making films about Islam or Muslims; they should quit to write about agency, terrorism, bombs, poorness,weakness,revenge, sleeper agents.......etc..there r real Muslims never confirms because Ä±slam never confirms anything of these..normal lives r being lived...obey the rules..no "takÄ±yye"..its forbidden..its seem however u r..pls quit showing Muslim women ugly..as a good example look at Turkey..u can see really good looking but covered women...please read "Mevlana", "Said Nursi"..u will find great stories to take or adopt...please keep on taking films on this way so u can contribute the tolerate..understanding..
It's just about safe to say that those movies have their place, as most movies do, but that when you start mixing real-life affairsÂand especially those linked to such acts as terrorism and religionÂyou begin unravelling something that really should be left alone if you're not going to deal with it in a dignified manner.
There is actually a boxing ring set up on the verge of the vineyard so that Dad and son can go to it in the ring.I know you don't believe me--but you'll see it when you get to this film.
Samir Horn (Don Cheadle) is an African-American Muslim who was born in Sudan and witnessed the death of his father in a car bombing when he was nine.
And why Samir would even take a chance in conducting an operation such as this when he knows that something could go wrong is beyond me.
It is difficult to become fully invested in characters about whom you are told so little -- but the story carries you along and certain of the mysteries are left hanging, even when the film ends.
Usually when a movie is a clunker the audience starts fidgeting and becomes restless.
One of the crucial plot points is the true allegiance of his character, and it is the subtlety of his performance that will keep you guessing what side he is fighting for, though when the answer is finally revealed, you'll think you knew all along.
I was offered a ticket to a screener last Wednesday, and when I heard Don Cheatle was in it, couldn't pass it by.
** On a side note** To the one reviewer who thinks Clooney shoots Brad out of no where, if you had actually bothered to pay attention during the movie you could see that when Clooney opens the closet the first thing he grabs for is his gun hanging on the wall.
His wife, who is cheating on him with another federal agent (George Clooney), accidentally steals the memoir when she is retrieving the couple's financial records.
About 60 minutes into the movie, one finally realizes that this is not a spy-thriller, or a mystery film, but rather a depiction of what happens when a bunch of self-centered morons are turned loose and run around like chickens with their heads cut off, so to speak.
And if you want to search for something meaningful beneath all this fun, you'll find that the movie is about how egoistic, lonely and lost we are when we elbow each other out of the way to accomplish our petty goals.
It may not be as strong as The Big Lebowski but nonetheless proves that when it comes to sarcastic humor the Coens still stand way above the rest.
The only thing funny about this movie is when Brad Pitt gets punched in the face and the chair George Clooney makes in his basement!
Forget the name Coen is on the box, because the Joel and Ethan Coen I've seen must have shut themselves off when they made this piece of work.
Everything in the film is far too tongue in cheek but when you have people getting killed and a serious tone it doesn't work.
Scenes of Clooney building his "Mystery Machine" kills you slowly when its only to find out that its a "Sit on it and Go Puck Yourself" Machine.
The one pet peeve I have is when the writing is bad they start throwing in bad language hoping it will get a laugh.
And just when you think there's FINALLY going to be something amusing... they "SHOCK" you back into realizing the movie sucks.
analyst, Osborne 'Ozzie' Cox (John Malkovich of "Being John Malkovich"), explodes with rage when his boss (David Rasche of "An Innocent Man") relieves him of his duties on the Balkans desk and shuffles him off to a lower security grade State Department post.
The volatile Cox spews profanity when his colleagues attribute his inferior job performance to alcoholism.
It was so surprising when I first saw it, that at first, I didn't even know what it was.
In fact when you think about it even though you may fall out of your seat laughing in any scene (they normally require buildups which are rare in modern comedies) you are either laughing or smiling in this film.
These point especially the last one may have a serious bearing on how you feel when the movie ends.
Although Swardson could of had a bigger role but it all good mix, of humour and 8 mile,  Terry Crews role was just hilarious, he can always make me laugh :O when is he gonna be a lead in a comedy???
8/10 "my uncle gave it to me for my birthday" you will laugh when you hear this quote occurs in the movie.
But when we meet them in person, they don't really have a clue about the ghetto or how to act like gangsters.
B-Rad finds out it's not real, and begins to take matters into his own hands, but when a real gangsta' named Tec holds the actors and B-Rad hostage, Bill Gluckman forgets his campaign and tries to find his son, along with B-Rad's wannabe-gangsta' friends.
Anderson isn't totally convincing in the role, since some of his ghetto slang pops up even when he's not playing the part of a stereotypical black man from the hood, but he's still very funny.
Kennedy can be funny when he works up to his potential, as he has shown in his WB series "The Jamie Kennedy Experiment."
I always enjoy it when a movie supersedes my expectations, and this is one of those cases.
And thankfully, Snoop Dogg has only a 3-minute voice cameo as a talking rat, because I stand by my word when I say that he should be banned from movies altogether.
So he lets him do the signs when he is talking.
An inexplicable sign is pulled down referring to women, so his dad is reasonably happy when the idea comes up of two black actors posing as gangsters to kidnap his lil' rapper and show him what the hood is really like...  At the the end of the day, you've got to wonder what sort of respectable adult would make this.
The scenes are made very poorly and some scenes are so funny, especially when one female robot takes her hand and starts to beat with it.
my favorite parts of this movie are when the lead android was first seen behind that log cabin home when she tried to attack the male actor's role managed to turn the tables on her and he terminated her by nearly running her over with the jeep that he drove.
Unfortunately, he's branded a fugitive when he is caught killing one of the cyborgs who replaced his girlfriend.
Great premise, though a bit underbudgeted (what could one expect when it came to sci-fi on network tv back in 1986?
I think this aired in 1986, on the old NBC Monday Night Movie, in the summer when it was usual to see lost TV pilots aired as movie-of-the-weeks.
It should also be noted that leading man Mark Lindsay Chapman, then going under the name Mark Lindsay, was given this role as compensation after being cast as John Lennon in a TV biopic, only to be removed when his real name was discovered to be the same as Lennon's killer.
No Disney Original Movie is going to be very good and this follows all the clichÃ©s - bad actors, bad script, inept director at the helm (probably a TV veteran and first-timer when it comes to film-making).
I especially liked the part when PAT became a human.
My sister started to watch towards the end, and when she saw PAT become a human, she said that she looked very familiar.
It's a lot of laughs and then gets a bit frightening when Sagal materializes as a holograph and shuts the place down.
Lets say when you get done watching it you'll never cry again.
The prince was a real Hottie and i liked when he jumped out the window.
My favorite scene was when stepmother uses the wand one last time.
I love it when the mice,the birds and the Fairy Godmother throw a party for Cinderella and The Prince, since it's the anniversary of when Cinderella put on the glass slipper, and married The Prince.
Another scene I love is when the two mice (Jaq & Gus) tell Cinderella what has happened by role-playing, it's very cute.
I will say that when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was impressed.
lol that's why we all need to read the title of a book and then flip it over and read the back of it before buying, or sometimes we open the book and read a page or we just decide to give it a shot and give the first chapter a read then when were done we are hooked or not.
Of course, there were a few good things, it was always fun to see Lady Tremaine (the stepmother) appear on the screen and when she left you wished she would come back, and the movie would be entertaining enough for a child, but it sadly doesn't even scratch the surface of the true classic, the original Disney's Cinderella.
I remember sitting in the theatre when the movie was re released in New Zealand cinemas at the age of ten and falling in love with the story then.
So when the sequel 'Cinderella 2 Dreams come true' came out( and I was a teen ) I was eager to see where the writers would take us next in Cinderellas life,unfortunately I was very disappointed.
That's a real shame, because when they get it right it's great.Also I know many people simply state that these DVD's are simply trying to ride the coat tails of there originals success and are made for "a quick buck"and obviously that's true.
But when they are not cheap and rushed but well told and polished like Cinderella 3, then it is a true joy to see the continuation of these beloved characters lives when they have been a part of so many wonderfully fond childhood memories.
The opening song is hysterical when it gets them and Drusilla's every sarcastic remark still makes me smile ("A stick... let's beat her with it."
However, when you compare this to The Lion King 2 or Aladdin and the king of thieves, this film doesn't even match.
The villain has much more screen time so you get to understand what she feels rather than when she didn't show rage and was cool and collected in the original.
However, I think that Disney has realized that nobody really likes those crappy sequels - even the kids - and so has been upping it's game when it comes to straight-to-DVD-sequels; lately, the attempts at thirds has been actually quite good.
when i heard that a Cinderella 3 was coming out, i was like..when did they ever make a Cinderella 2. so i did some online searching, and i found the Cinderella 2 summary and it somewhat rang a bell.
some of my favorite parts was when the prince jumps out the window, i just love his facial expressions and how he does it, it looks like hes trying to fly.
Lady Tremaine magically rewinds time to the moment when the Grand Duke shows up with the glass slipper in the first film.
I mean, when the King was showing Stacy the Kingdom I expected him to warn her against going to the elephant graveyard.
Drizella is a repulsive pig (in more than one wayÂwatch her face when Tremaine brushes her hair, please) and Stacy is the worst dancer in the world.
seriously people when kids see the original they will think that some random magical person will come and solve all their problems.
although when you kids see this and also the first sequel (cinderlla 2 dreams come true) they will learn that something might happen to their magical person and that when you sit around doing nothing you wont get anything near of what you want (ofcoarse friends would also be helpful) also in both sequels Cinderella is much more independent and you learn a lot more about the other characters like the princes mother and the kings past and the stepmother is countless times more evil.
And soon, the wicked stepmother takes matters into her own hands by reversing time to when the duke arrived to try the slipper on the feet of the stepsisters.
I was excited to see this movie when I first heard about it.
Now's when the movie kicks into high.
Although what follows seems a bit hokey when describing it (The magic of the wand is not as powerful as Cinderella and the prince's predestined love) it is handled maturely and time is given for the couple to get to know each other a bit more (in the first film they had said, what, four words) before getting married.
In a time when every other blonde that girls are looking up to are drug-addicts or bulimic it's refreshing to see a twist on a classic character that makes her someone to be admired.
Let's just say it ain't great, I gave this film a 4/10 as it's not a total lost cause but i cant recommend spending 2+hours watching this when there are better films out there.
Her scenes when Dolly is lying (?)
On a general note, it's nice to see a film about a bygone, more civilized time, when one could light a cigarette without being treated like Lucifer incarnate.
Karen Silkwood worked a a plutonium factory, when the Union was almost gotten rid of Karen and some other people got together to fight to keep the union.
Especially when she flashed the boss.
He lights and shoots Streep to look almost too movie-star pretty in many scenes (despite her awful shag haircut), and her voice is almost too good when she sings "Amazing Grace."
Though Karen and her husband, played by Kurt Russell, have a large Confederate flag over their bedpost and she doesn't seem to feel any guilt or remorse when she hits a deer with her car, we don't find it difficult investing in her very human story.
However, Karen changes dramatically, when she starts to realize that the management of the plant they work in, is quite lax on security and health issues.
Apparently, when "Silkwood" came out, Mike Nichols hadn't released a notable movie since "The Fortune" nearly killed his career eight years earlier.
She works in the power plant, which seems to be pretty normal, but when the truth is unfolded, it puts everyone who works there lives in danger.
But, all goes downhill when Karen realises that the plant are cheating all the employees and putting people's lives in risk and in danger.
But, when one of Karen's friends gets `cooked' and has to be cleaned with a brush she becomes suspicious.
She changes, however, when she realises that the management of the plant have a cavalier attitude towards the health and safety of their employees, particularly the risks of radioactive contamination, and that, worse still, they are doctoring x-ray photographs of the fuel rods in order to cover up potential defects that could prove disastrous.
And the reactions worked for me, because when I think of how seriously people reacted to issues like nuclear or toxic contamination back in the late 70s/early 80s, there was a lot less info available.
Why did she risk her life when she finally truly understood the risks?
The lives of working class Americans are shamefully under-represented by Hollywood, and when a poor person is depicted (as something other than a criminal), it's almost always with the subtext of hope and the American dream.
Karen, a somewhat rebellious, less-than-conscientious worker, is shocked into activism when her co-worker Thelma, becomes exposed to radioactive contamination, or "cooked."
There is fear when Karen sticks her neck out -- talking to union reps, traveling to Washington, and being sent back to work with a dangerous assignment: to gather evidence.
My favorite scene is when they're searching logs for traces of a computer break-in and the hero exclaims when no traces are found "There's not even a cookie?!?".
This game is excellent, especially when dealing with two dimensional Super Nintendo gaming.
But I absolutely hate it when people take history and completely ignore facts to add their own "idea" of realism.
In fact, they went through a lot of trouble to rescue both the dead and the living from the flames, when any of their dwelling places was set on fire by an enemy.
It's when Red is found dead, in a suspicious hit and run accident, with his name and address on her that Hammer goes into action in finding who's responsible for Red's untimely death; that he rightfully feels was a murder not an accident.
It's when Hammer finds that this usual ring, with a V craved on it, that Red had on her was missing that he had his girl Friday, or secretary, Velda, Pamela Duncan, check it out for him.
That besides him being as convincing, if not more so, as Meeker was in showing how brutal and ruthless Mike Hammer can be when he wanted to get information as well as slug it out with the bad guys.
I first saw it back in the eighties when I was about 8 or 9 years old.
Now almost 20 years on I saw it again, and it really brought back nostalgic memories from when I was a kid.
This show, when first seen was bright, fresh and most importantly funny.
David I found was the worst for pointing out peoples problems and I found it funny when someone asked him if he thought that he was nothing with Frank.
I'd never heard of it when I happened by chance to see it at a friend's house.
Although if you're like me, you might think it's about that one hand-me-down that nobody else wanted, that got you started, the one that years later, when you saw some kid admiring it, you just *knew* it no longer belonged to you...  
This is the perfect movie for a rainy autumn Sunday afternoon when everything is quiet but the popping of the fire and the creaking of your favorite easy chair.
But for a few moments when his superb acting absorbs me, I am distracted by his presence.
Flash forward to 2005 when the internet has become so powerful and potentially dangerous that the US government sets up a division within the FBI entitled "Netforce" to preside and protect over it from the evil people of the world who look to exploit it for their corrupt plans.
Which further shows the weak structure of the story's narrative when the movie spends too much time on them.
The scene when he is listening to the playing of the Red Violin can not be put into words.
When many first see this film, they will be surprised when they notice that it is a silent film even though made in 1931.
When discovered, she is cast out and the young man behaves horribly--only trying to correct his error when it is too late.
My family taped it when it came on TV (on beta video) we watched it lots and lots of times, until my parents went out and bought a VHS video and out went all the beta videos.
She tries again every couple of months (when I mention it).
Mad Max 1, 2 and 3, did for the tourism industry when they were released.
Do movies have a role in our lives other than being our "chocolate-covered treats," something we give ourselves only when we feel we deserve a reward for all our work and hardships?
The mother spurns Lim, sending her home when she visits the town, but The-en instead takes her to his apartment, where she stays, happily, until her father comes to take her home to her mother's deathbed.
And Lingyu Ruan is not only very beautiful, but she has an extraordinarily expressive face, especially when she's happy, when she looks a little like 21st-century model Vivian Hsu.
It's sad how long we have to wait for certain movies to be available in some way, especially when most of these movies prove to be completely delightful in every possible way.
I especially can't wait to view it with the commentary...which, when you think about it, could be a bit redundant!
Not every artist or legendary event is shown in this documentary,artists like Joni Mitchell and the Band are not included which I personaly would have enjoyed.And the forgotten "Abbie Hoffman incident" is also not included.I have this incident on CD,the Who box set,but I would have liked it when I had on DVD also.But then,You can't have everything!Also some songs and artists are kind of misplaced.Best example for me is the performance of Sha-Na-Na doing "At the Hop".This Rock 'n Roll song doesn't quite belong on this festival,but still it is a funny sort of intermezzo.
She falls in love with the son of the rich woman who owns the property she and her father and mother toil on, but is betrayed by him when she gets pregnant out of wedlock.
The title cards are in Chinese and English, and many have decorative backgrounds, always a plus for me when I watch silent films.
I love it when they interview the people in this movie since it's a trip listening to them.
This movement set in motion something that will return - when we are truly pure enough to live co - operatively.In peace and tolerance.
when the movie was first released, I saw Woodstock in a theater with my great uncle.
In another odd bit of serendipity, when the film came out I was going to college in Buffalo, New York, and wound up heading to Toronto with a buddy for a day trip.
It's really about American young people at a peculiar period in western history, when the "baby boom" brought a new, numerous generation "on stage".
The promoters who accepted they were going to "take a big bath" when they realised they had to take down the fences and make it a free concert for safety reasons.
The only good scene is at the very beginning when two terrorist babes blow up a Parisian restaurant.
The old saying "One swallow does not make a summer" is particularly apt when discussing this film.
It runs in part "Do not harm when words are enough...do not maim when injury is enough, do not kill when maiming is enough...".
I thought this movie was a good lesson to all of the viewers that when you mess with Jason Yee, you get "yee" butt kicked.
This film is like a metaphor for what many people go through in their everyday life - just trying to get by when it seems like the whole world is against you- you can sympathize with the Derek Wu character.
If they can't even keep a straight face or tone of voice while making this, then why should I when I watch it, even though it's not meant to be comedy.
Just be ready to make some coffee or get a beer or something when the maudlin and implausible romance takes over.
And when they said that line about Brandon Lee, I actually ROFL'd.
Unexpected bonus: Imagine my delight when I recognized Justine's home as one designed by friends - Indigo and Ochre, Architects based in Sydney.
This movie should make us reflect on whether or not it is our business to step in when we see someone getting abuse.
What makes a good film is when it's realistic and everybody reacts in a way the majority would.
(I gotta keep my mind open for all possible ludicrous combinations when it comes to TE.)
So why didn't they use those abilities to get revenge on the old man who lives across the street, who failed to call for help when he saw that something was happening?
I didn't even know that this was a remake when watching it but the clues are left and right.
Mom has died a spooky death from starvation, he learns, when he moves in to her old apartment.
It's when Bobby decides he can no longer put up with the abuse he is overhearing next door and reports it to the cops, only to have them respond to a completely vacant apartment next door, that things go from odd to friggin' strange.
The cast is quite good but it's kinda hard to feel a great chemistry between them when they're all together but that's OK because most part of the time the story sets each one of them individually.
Lindsay Price is a lot unfamiliar to me because she's been in countless shows but I can't remember her in any of them, anyway, she surprises me a lot when I got myself laughing with some of her moments, but her character stills being quite weak to be placed as "one of the 50 most powerful women" in the show.
I started to watch it just because of the spoiler, when one of girls writes something bad on a coat and the woman leaves and everyone see's it.
I just want to slap Victory when she starts that "I don't need you to rescue me" stuff.
But then- when we get to 'Pink Poison'.
Especially, when Joe was in bad condition, she proposed to him and never gave him up.
The best part of season two for me is the episode where they go to the spa (without alcohol en cellphones....) when they go back as fast as they can... hahaha....and then they get car trouble.
NO...and this is when Lipstick jungle comes into the picture.
Don't we have issues and problems and fun and all that when we are in a serious relationship or married??
The underlying message that women can make it in the workforce and not have to apologize for it is strong in places, yet weak in others...like when they submit to the stereotypes of their gender.
The production values are very impressive especially when you consider this is a period television series with considerable scope and budget limitations.
But the show belongs to Michael Kitchen and you wonder why you've never seen this actor before and when you will see him again.
With all the chaos of war, and darkness of human behavior, Foyle moves through it all, self-possessed, caring, and ultimately, even when circumstances beyond his control keep him from actually incarcerating the wrongdoer, successful in protecting his charges from evil.
The story is simple: a leopard escapes from a traveling circus in a small New Mexican town and terror begins to reign when the corpse of a young woman is found apparently dead as a result of leopard's attack.
However, special note should be taken of Dynamite, the big cat who receives billing, possibly as a result of his terrifying performance in Cat People, when he set the stage for the action, chewing on a large roast in his cage.
I saw this movie many years ago,and it was plenty scary,especially,the part,where the mother wouldn't let her daughter in the house,unless she brought food,so she went to get food and on the way back,she saw white eyes looking at her,and she started to run,she got to her mothers house,but it was to late,she gets attacked by a leopard and her mother sees blood coming from under the door,when she opens the door she sees her daughter laying dead,that is about all i remember about the movie and often wonder if it will ever be released on video.
i really would love to see this movie again.i would like to see if the movie is as scary as when i first saw it.
It doesn't have the same kind of strange, mystical power of other Lewton films, but is effective at invoking the image of dark streets at night, when the most ordinary sidewalks and street lamps take on a sinister feeling.
The town becomes incredibly frightened, when one dead body is replaced with another each night and the evidence is pointing towards the leopard.
**SPOILERS**  Working in a Spanish-theme nightclub, Kiki, (Jean Brooks) and Clo-Clo, (Margo) are surprised when club-owner Jerry Manning, (Dennis O'Keefe) decides to pair Kiki up with a leopard for her act.
This sets an ominous tone when we are suddenly introduced to a completely new set of characters--a poor Mexican family.
I first saw this movie in the mid '90s, was not that impressed, but gave it another look when I acquired the Lewton set.
At least he did when making little suspense programmers under producer Val Lewton, who headed RKO's second-feature unit in the wartime 1940s.
With The Leopard Man, Tourneur was handed a script that showed little promise; when he was finished with it, it shone with his distinctive black magic.
Who needs a budget when you've got this much talent and style?
In an age when serial killers are deified, what Val Lewton and company wrought so long ago must seem tame, indeed; quaint.
The use of shadows and lighting is impressive, and when you combine this with Jacques Tourneur's incredible ability to stage a scene amidst this atmosphere; you've got a recipe for a truly great horror movie.
Frankly, it gives one cause to wonder if some of these people came to the film expecting to get aroused, and when they didn't, they chose to look no deeper.
I specially liked the episode of her return to Singapore, which depicts so well the gap that has been experienced by this proud, ingenuous nature, hypnotised by the freedom of America - as far as to forget all moral barriers and follow her single pleasure till the extreme - and then crash down on reality when going back to her family roots - probably in search of a recomfort she was starting to miss in the vain and stupid environment of those cynical sex filmmakers.
I had to laugh when one porn star (MIchael Coxx) stated that her signature act gave porno a bad name, and a porn star (Ona Zee) trying to pretend that she did "high class" porn.
Then when someone breaks her record, she gets all depressed and I think she had a lot more problems than the viewer really saw.
A good documentary, not award winningly shot but the message is clear to see from the makers 'Don't get scorn by porn' Not for the faint hearted, I saw this when it came out and every time i see it i still feel really bad for her and that i should do something about it, mainly to those directly responsible for corrupting her.
Its only when she tries to verbalise a lot of what she is thinking that we see the pain, the emotional torment that must be facing her every day of her life.
And when it comes, it hits hard.
Naturally, SciFi isn't showing it again anytime soon (why show quality independent cinema when you can run 100 promos promising to show us the identity of the Final Cylon in its place, after all?)
It's a thriller, full of little character studies when it's not forcing you off the edge of your seat.
That all changed last week when I watched Mulberry Street.
Still it sets everyone up so nicely that when then infected begin to assault the people we've come to know we are more than horrified, we are saddened by their fates.
I don't know when it was the last time I was choked up at a horror film.
Larry Fessenden has a funny cameo as a running civilian who locks the gate on a fellow citizen, later suffering the consequences when he himself needs help.
Clutch is a former boxer who lives in an apartment on Mulberry Street in New York.With his friend Coco they eagerly await for Clutch's daughter Casey to return home from Iraq.We also meet the other tenants in this dilapidated complex Charlie and Frank who are a couple of old timers and a bartender Kay and her teenage son.Unfortunately their place of living becomes hell,when New Yorkers mysteriously turn into bloodthirsty rat creatures.
Clutch, Kay, and Casey witness the horror that ensues when bodies are ripped apart and fed upon as once normal humans turn into vermin themselves scavenging for scraps of meat.
It brought me back to the day when apocalypse movies were abundant and new.
It's scary, when you see these people faces and the way they act before they turn into rat people.
One of the scarier moments was when the building super, who got bit, started crawling up the inside of the walls and ceilings.
The visual of the film was hand-held, like a camcorder and when the action heightened it got shakier and more intense.
The little furry pests are crawling all over the place and you better hope they don't bite a chunk out of you because, when that happens, you start growing hair out of strange places and want to eat human flesh!
I was made to feel a part of the community of Mulberry Street, so when things start to go wrong, I felt as anxious as the characters.
I like it when I get lost in the world I am watching, no matter how fantastical the situation may be.
It stuck with you, and your were nervous when nothing was happening.
It's good stuff when a movie pulls that off.
Using the camera well with a lot of close ups,speeding things up when appropriate to cover for lower budget make-up effects - which I thought were pretty good anyway, creating characters that you actually care about (loved the 2 old guys), and some really nice and clever ideas, like the photo of the 3 main characters held by the army girl, fading over to a different picture from the same film, owned by her father, was very nice.
I was really surprised I didn't hear anything about this when in theaters, it being from John Hughes and all.
In particular when it is aimed towards children.
You are allowed to think that I'm talking a bunch of nonsense here, but I've got to make a stand for a movie like "Reach the rock"; a sensible, heartfelt tale that went completely unnoticeable when it came out.
and brought grace alongside Amy Adams to "Junebug"), stars as Robin, the most rebellious kid of a small town which is no longer a kid but still does the mischief a teenager does when he wants to get attention.
I was channel hoping when I caught the start of this film but it was one of those gems that really had me hooked.
Solondz characters are all losers or players, when really we are all a little of both and not so much of either.
perhaps Solondz wants to demonize life when life is more of a purgatory than a hell.
There's nothing in movies more frustrating to me than when a director/writer finds fertile soil and only digs two inches deep.
The seemingly ideal perfect sister is dry, secretly dull and lives such a sterile life that when an obscene phone caller calls her... she starts stalking him.
Yes, there's plenty of postmodern film-within-the-film winking, but that quickly falls apart as we reach the heartbreaking and disturbing ending, when the movie suddenly becomes painfully real.
*Spoilers Next*For example: when the character Scobby is high on marijuana and sees himself as a guest on Conan Doyle's Show...great!!
And when his little brother(highly annoying and egotistic but also very intelligent)hypnotize his father to..love him!
The moment when Vi walks into the restroom to freshen up, and discovers the dozens of photographs of other girls, some who i believe are in Vi's class, who ended up in the same predicament was a nice touch to a kind of dry film.
Side note: I had to watch "Fiction" twice, as I failed to see its correlation to "Nonfiction" when I watched it the first time.
expect when they enter a theatre.
Thankfully just when we've seen it all and were sure that nothing matters and nothing can surprise, startle, or offend us, Todd Solondz will be there to show things can always get worse.
However, when you compare it to his previous films, "Happiness" and "Palindromes", it seems like Sesame Street in comparison.
Scooby doesn't know what he wants out of life, doesn't even care to take the SATs at school, and wants to be a talk show host when he grows up.
watching a Tod solondz movie is like when you watch yourself in the mirror early in the morning when you aren't completely awake.
It's pretty rare when I am at a loss for words, particularly when I am weighing an opinion on a film.
Even more rare is when I'm speechless about a film by a favorite filmmaker.
In the film, when a fellow filmmaker criticizes Toby, telling him it is "glib and facile to make fun of those people", Toby denies this, simply saying "I love them."
The situations are painful and the characters are sympathetic (or pathetic, depending on how you look at them), but the pain comes from Solondz not turning the camera away from the subject when they are at their most vulnerable.
Later, when he returns home to an unexpected tragedy at home, among the various policemen, etc., Toby runs up to Scooby with Mike, camera in tow, saying, "Oh my god, Scooby.
He perks up a bit when there are no grownups around, but most of the time the "stupid" barrier is up and his eyes are half-closed and red from smoking pot.
Probably Director Todd Solondz' most mature work to date, Storytelling is split into two parts `Fiction' and `Non-Fiction' - yet similar themes underlie both and pose questions about what we call reality when it comes to prejudice and taboo subjects.
World Championship Steve Austin VS Undertaker - A very well done match, especially considering Austin was knocked silly when they knocked heads about 3 or 4 minutes in.
It suffers from some of the things so common in fantasy films: Simplified storyline, too many things fall into place for the characters, generally directed at children when it doesn't need to be to include them.
I feel like I grew up in a generation where -- I knew how a blue screen worked when I was a five-year-old, and growing up with magazines like Cinefex around, there's no illusion to it.
There's a lot of fancy digital effects in the film, but they were used when the effect could only be created digitally, when there was no way to do something practical."
I had never even hear of City of Ember, but when my mother asked my husband and I to go see it I decided to go.
However, it is very hard not to, when the plot of the movie is fragile and could fall apart if the string was pulled a little.
Like I said earlier, it's just sad when you see such a good movie go to waste when people don't watch it and forget about it.
This may be a film that succeeds in capturing the magic of the family film glory days of the 80's, (it took me right back to when I was ten years old and for the first time in years allowed me to become totally engrossed in the world that was portrayed before me) this does not mean you have to stay true to the 80's in your marketing campaign !!!
I absolutely loved the book when I read it while I was in gradeschool.
Its one of those eye-opening books that makes you look at humanity in a completely different way, and so I was incredibly excited when I found out that it would be adapted into a movie.
Like all good plans a flaw is discovered when a succeeding mayor dies without passing on the box.
Great little horror film that i found when i was about 10 at the local book shop for sale under the title scared alive, the back of the cover looked interesting and i thought for 5 dollars, i can't really go wrong, Anyways i got away with buying an M15+ rated film which ten years later I'm so glad i did, The movie starts of with a girl who is getting ready to go for a swim, (notice the weird, but cool pop song she is listening to on a little tape player).
So the directer decides to make a few change's So that the lead actress Betty Jean doesn't have much to say in the film, but when people start to get killed on the island, (by a killer who always leaves his mark with that tape player that was at the start, but this time it is playing lyrics like Boil me, Nail me, Burn me, Stab me etc and is always swinging around), The actors are scared, and want to know who is doing the slaying's is it one of them?.
When they finally leave the city via escape slide they go down down down...then they walk up up up stairs to escape to the surface... when they are at the surface they can see the city far below through a karst window (cave)yet when the generator stops they see no light in the city...I didn't really need ten lines of text to say this movie was a lame waste of time and money.
I enjoyed the sets of the subterranean city and the teen kids were likable, but it took a little long before anything happened and when it did it was a little too far-fetched with poor special-effects.
To be sure, there are moments when the film dabbles in and out of tired clichÃ©s, most of which we have seen countless times this year alone in other children's adventures; yet what distinguishes this from, say, The Chronicles of Narnia or The Spiderwick Chronicles is through its mature themes and presentation that keeps the older viewer in mind.
Furthermore, the special effects work, although a little obvious during certain sequences involving humans, is noticeably strong; particularly when a giant mole-like creature appears.
It hasn't had an easy launch either because it's been competing with High School Musical 3, when i went to see it the cinema was empty apart from me because everyone else had gone to see a certain other film.
Then, on the day when the filmmakers come, the ship that the filmmakers are on explodes, killing everyone on board, and leaving the filmmakers trapped on the island along with the killer.
It's very hard to care about the characters, likeable though they are, when every line of dialogue is punctuated by unnecessary pregnant pauses (a sure sign of incompetent direction).
My first impression going in to see "Brokeback Mountain" when that one came out, was; "How boringly common gay love seem to be".
But Arakki does not stay within content when making his movies great (when they are).
Everyone starts getting bumped off in mildly gory ways that refer to the catchy punk song "Face to Face" which is always playing when someone gets knocked off.
This cartoon is funny when taken on it's own, but very similar to "Cat Concerto" a Tom & Jerry short made around the same time with the same storyline.
In this episode, Bugs Bunny begins to play Lizst's second Hungarian Rhapsody, when a mouse, who lives in the piano, interrupts Bugs Bunny and the rabbit begins to play various other tunes (not all classical), all very well.
My favourite joke in the cartoon (I found it even funnier when I realised that it was Lizst's music Bugs Bunny was playing), is when Bugs Bunny receives a call in the middle of the show.
In fact, Noonan showed that he was a fine actor by stealing the last scene from Judy Garland in A Star Is Born when he tells her how pitiful she's behaving since Norman Maine had committed suicide, but there is one person in the line-dancers that's had a history that no one knows about.
I remember seeing him in a dance recital given by the O'Neils when he was there and he sang a jazzed up version of Indian Love Call and did a dance ending up with his jumping up on the side on stage and back down like James Cagney did in Yankee Doodle Dandy.
Furthermore, Crichton's plotting is awful as the film quickly becomes boring when the writer-director starts forgetting to explain things properly.
I couldn't have gone to the movies but every week I had in mind to see it and when I saw it at last there was many people and it continues for the same reason, people is still interested about this film.
***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** It is a great film about what can happen when a father looses a son by a suicide and the feeling of guilt appear when he's the only one who knows all the truth.
In my opinion, he had a big depression, he was forced to go to the psychiatrist who happened to be his father's friend, he abused him and he wasn't able to talk about it with his father even though it seemed that he was a good father and was open to hear everything his son wanted to say The boy felt too bad and desperate that he prefer to die than to speak... On the other hand, there's people who told me that they think the boy was depressed and forced to go with his father's friend and when he started abusing him, he started to feel dirty but at the same time he liked it, so he got confussed by the feeling of being gay, that he commited suicide.
McLoughlin's direction is balanced and well-executed, building up the tension when he should, but without resorting to needless exaggerations.
Why, for example, does the main bad guy/thug move items unnecessarily when searching an apartment?
An intelligent assassin also wouldn't use a submachine gun in a doctor's office, the Looker weapon wouldn't fit in a standard pistol holster, a sink won't spray water out of the drain when hit by an errant bullet, yada-yada....
An early scene where Thomas the patient flips out violently after being touched by an extremely hot, sexually agressive young woman gives away the fact that Thomas was sexually molested as a child, although like a bad poker player who shows his cards but figures nobody was really paying attention anyway the filmmakers seem to think the audience will react with something other than complete indifference or a loud duh when they finally pull the molestation card out about forty minutes later.
So when you watch this movie be prepared to watch it with time.
I think a lot of detail was put in things as simple as sitting in a chair, when to lean back, when to lean forward.
Tommy, almost by accident, get's to know Michael's young teenage daughter Shelly who falls in love with him when she meets Tommy at a dance by the railroad yard when he was out on a night-time leave from Holly Heath.
Tommy also murdered a young girl Chole, Kim Schraner, earlier that evening when she aggressively come on to him by the deserted railroad cars not knowing what kind of monster the shy sweet and good looking Tommy really is.
Tommy had developed a murderous hatred of women, or young girls, who try to be intimate with him because of what happened to his mom when he was a young boy; she was brutally murdered by his dad Joseph Caffey, Sam Bottoms, when he found that she was having an affair with another man.
But when confronted with the truth by Michael, and seeing that he really needs help, and that a life on the outside will only end with him being either dead or on death row the movie couldn't have ended any other way.
Big city shots are used, which is rare when something is being filmed in Canada.
In residence in Mr. Lee's home, she learns to tolerate the constant mah jong games with Mr. Lee's wife (Joan Chen) and her gossipy girlfriends, only to await the moment when Mr. Lee will notice her and hopefully begin an affair that will result in inside information espionage.
The group plans on using sex as bait to attract,then strike when he is not expecting it.
The film became widely known when it received the dreaded NC-17 from the MPAA.
Despite the unrestrictedness in the knowledge domain of the audience, tension mounts on when Jiazhi Wang (Wei Tang) embarks on her mission to assassinate her target as the audience are puzzled with the leads' staging and other diegetic hints on whether or not her identity is or will be exposed.
Tang Wei, Ang Lee & co have put together a brilliant depiction of a dark and haunting time when the common person was buffeted and often destroyed by the struggle between titanic powers, emotions, and ideas.
The definite moment when she falls for him is at the Japanese club when he reveals his weakness.
She might not realise her love to Yee but she knew it when receiving the ring from Yee whose eyes are full of love.
The surreal atmosphere that she creates when she is Mai Tai Tai is stunning.
I won't spoil too much but there were several times when it became too difficult to watch.
Early in the movie, Wong Chia Chi (Tang Wei) gets asked to act in a patriotic play, in a time when China was threatened by the Japanese Invasion during the late 30s/early 40s.
It's not a glam job, especially when you're casting your lot with the underdogs.
It's falling for and sleeping with the enemy both ways, and in a time where trust is hard pressed, this makes everything more complex, especially when it comes to irrational emotions that overrule logic and guard.
So when one particular young woman (Susan Dey) comes in for an operation, he decides to keep her within his sight and finds out about some slimy deeds.
The diamond ring, when the secretary returns back and says, "it's yours."
There are numerous instances when I was reminded of the film's appropriate title, "Lust, CAUTION"!
He was portrayed as a traitor in the movie, and he never spoke about how he viewed himself except for the scene in the Japanese brothel, when Tang's character asked him if he took her there so she could be his whore.
Interestingly enough, the only moment in the movie where both Leung and Tang's characters felt a mutual love was not in bed, but in the Japanese brothel when Tang performed a song for Leung.
I watched this film when i was about 14 and spent the next decade hunting for it after it became deleted, i recently came across it and watching it now i can appreciate it in its silly 80's glory!
I don't know, and it all seemed to go downhill when Jeffrey Katzenberg left Disney for DreamWorks with Spielberg.
I was only five years old when this hit animated Disney flick came into theatres, and don't recall ever going to see any movies on the big screen when I was that young, so I obviously didn't see this one.
A while later (I can't remember exactly when), I saw it on the small screen for the first time, and while I don't think I ever liked it as much as Disney's "Aladdin", it was enjoyable enough for me to watch several more times.
Directed by Gary Trousdale and Kirk Wise, and based on the well known fairy tale, it all begins in a peaceful village, and a young girl named Belle (voiced by Paige O'Hara) takes a stroll around, and at one point when she reads a book by a fountain, one of the sheep tears off a page and eats it.
Meanwhile, back at the village, Belle's macho fiancÃ©, Gaston (voiced by Richard White), who is that much of a game hunter, makes several attempts to make Belle his wife, and thinks Maurice is a "crazy old man" when Maurice shouts, "He's got her locked in a dungeon!
The ballroom sequence, and the sequence that shows when the beast becomes human are among the most outstanding animated sequences in recent cinema.
I first saw Beauty and the Beast when I was a little girl, around the time that I watched the other Disney classics.
However, LumiÃ¨re and Belle come incredibly close to Chip when it comes to my favorite characters of this film.
Beauty and the Beast is a movie for all ages, it will make you happy when you're child, and make you cry when you're older.
Still, when you look at the whole picture, this is a solid movie and probably one of the Disney's all-time best animated movies.
You also have a cool flash gun that stuns a person for a good while when used.
It also has its rather funny scenes as a couple of those deaths that happen when they are filming those bad commercials are just great.
But when their horse returns without papa, Belle sets out to find the awful truth in an enchanted castle.
I collect everything I can now, and watch it when I need a lift.
One day when her father's inventions are about to be displayed at the fair, he gets lost in the woods and stumbles across a castle and is held prisoner.
You all know the story, so apart from pointing out the movie's one flaw (the prince's spell had to be broken before he turned 21 or he would remain a beast forever; so if it was cast ten years before the events of the movie, wouldn't that mean he was 11 when the spell was cast...?
I was flicking channels one night when the music made me stop and I watched the rest of the film.
It made quite an impression in Australia when released, but was less successful overseas.
But when a Colombian director needs to go to these extremes of bad taste to broadcast (once again) the false notion that his country is a narcotics paradise, you can only feel sorry for him.
Another thing that troubles me is the fact that the movie turns around a load of ecstasy like pills when that's exactly the one drug that Colombia is not known to be a quality producer.
Though I was a kid when "Looker" came out.
Why need bullets to kill, when you can use a special light to cause disorientation.
This movie looked liked a drama at first, but when I watched some more, it was much more interesting.
In this series when Emmanuelle was making love to Haffron, the camera was spinning around & around the bed.
I actually saw this movie when it first came out when I was just eleven years old.
The major problem with the film "Let it Be" is the director who quite clearly shot far more footage and sound than he could ever hope to wade through (check out the 30 days bootleg to hear over 16 cds worth of sound recording made by the film crew) so when it time to match performance with film , well he couldn't do it .
The film is a good look at the Beatles second to last studio sessions but as a documentary goes there is so much tampering with what you see (its very badly synched up even when the performance does "match" the visual) that it loses marks in my opinion .
Pretty much all of the initial solo work is lauded in equally stellar terms as 'Abbey Road', 'white album' etc, and it's only when there was no one around with sufficient gravitas to hit the quality control button ('Sometime in New York City' anyone?)
This is what happens when years of tension finally build up, and it is all caught on film.
Of course, I'm sure most Beatles fans are well aware of what went on whilst making this album (Lennon's minimal involvement due to his addictions to heroin and Yoko Ono; McCartney's domination, not only in the songwriting department but also in regards to group leadership; Harrison's disenchantment and Ringo's melancholy boredom) so when watching the film you will not see The Beatles at their best.
Ringo Starr is silent for most of the time, John Lennon is also quiet and George Harrison seems to fuss with Paul when he speaks.
Camera's are set up for him when he stages Let it Be and Hey Jude, where he is seen staring obsessively at the camera.
However, when the other Beatles sing a song, the camera is less focused, and more candid.
I saw this movie when it first was released.
The dialog between John and Paul are at times serious when it surrounds the bands musical structure.
I didn't see it then; it was several years later, when it was a staple at 'midnight movie' showings (as was 'Magical Mystery Tour').
Sure they argue, there are times when they seem to just "do nothing" and let the hours pass, but still, when they play...
Sure, too the playing's a bit sloppy at times but there's never a moment when there isn't fascination at something going on on-screen.
Having never seen any VHS copies of this last Beatles movie and since it will probably be a very long time before it gets on DVD, I was stoked when I found out YouTube had this uploaded since the later part of summer 2007 and it was still there.
All the things director Michael Lindsay-Hogg filmed were fascinating to me especially when Ringo played some piano with Paul or when John and Yoko danced or when Heather-a young pre-teen who's Paul's future wife Linda's daughter from a previous marriage-hung around the Apple Studios.
I watched this Beatles documentary for the first time when it was released for the second time in the Spanish theaters in 1980.
For 1981 I would consider it pretty high tech but for today a little dated, but when I watch any movie I always want to know when it was made so I won't judge it by contemporary standards.
I have just bought the two volumes of "The Time Tunnel" on DVD and while watching this fantastic episode, I felt like traveling in time to my adolescence when "The Time Tunnel" together with "Star Trek" and "Lost in Space" were my favorite shows in the Brazilian black & white television (color TV was introduced in Brazil in 1970, and only years later I could afford to buy one).
he takes a few tentative steps away from the group, and returns - after coming up against challenges when he strikes out on his own or gets pulled back in by other members.
finally when it comes down to the line, a crisis situation that is going to affect the rest of his life, he grows into his own skin and decisively chooses his own path.
spoiler coming up ill have 5 slashes to tell you when I'm done spoiling.
when double d starts to become crazy puck only thinks about himself he should of realized the problem before he passed and i was so happy when puck put all the bad neo-nazi's to sleep because he was standing up for himself.
Just when you thought you knew where it was going, it took a bizarre twist that totally shook up your expectations.
kinda like the feeling of watching a scary movie, when a stranger is knocking on your door, don't let him in.
The story took a little while to start cooking (to continue with a lame metaphor), but when it did, I couldn't stop watching.
I downloaded the real Anarchist Cookbook from a BBS, bulletin board system (Pre-internet "websites") when I was in my teens; and let me tell you one thing - there is nothing anarchistic in this script, he rips off a "Chic-filet" style joint in the beginning - like that takes a lack of authoritarian fear.
Johnny Black is a nihilist, and he turns the anarchists into his toys, he uses them and destroys something beautiful (SAM) when doing it.
Puck is a fantastic representation of anarchist ideals used in good and bad ways from when he works with johnny to when he is working sixty hours a week and throwing surprise birthday parties for his co-workers.
One of the biggest things he does is when he kills johnny black and all the skinheads that were working with him.
The message here is that when decent people become anarchists, they do not get laid.
but when the police try to help, no one seems to know anything.
However, when it comes to crime films; Lenzi comes into his own, and just like Almost Human a couple of years earlier, Violent Naples is an entertaining and nasty little crime thriller.
A plastic surgeon gets suspicious when the police question him about the death of a model he's worked on, and learns that all the models he's worked on who came in with "shopping lists" of miniscule changes that "had to be fixed, so I could be perfect," are dead.
He obviously promotes anti-Palin scurrilous rumors, attacks Republicans with an irrationality that would do Bill Maher proud, and omits basic facts when characterizing his pathologically fearful enemies (does he have a list, maybe he can count them down?).
I have to admit it, I didn't really mind Keith Olbermann when he was on ESPN.
In a time when watching Chris Matthews, Tucker Carlson, Lou Dobbs, Bill O'Reilly and Hannity can be repetitive, boring, safe, wretched, and just downright wrong and bullying (even if the former sometimes is OK), Keith Olbermann is a sublime respite.
I think not; when watching Olbermann go into one of his "special comments" it comes about as close to- if not quite as classical- as an Edward R. Murrow speech rallying against one injustice or another.
I particularly like it when he attacks the faux news (noise) folks for the prostitutes they are to the fascist "upper" hand now running into oblivion what was the American Republican Party.
I liked it post 9-11 when he "took on" the charities for their failure to give much of the donations to the needy in a timely manner; I am disgusted that he hasn't lived up to his promise to denounce this administration when weapons of mass destruction have not been found in Iraq; and also find it revolting and channel changing that he repeats and glorifies distortion and other fascist propaganda.
I first learned about "Countdown w/Keith Olbermann" when I read a transcript of Keith Olbermann's special comment "Liar in Chief...the president who makes things up", identifying that George W. Bush had claimed that Democrats had made certain claims (which of course they'd never actually made).
He reminds me of a time when being a journalist meant something more than being a personality who likes to wear "bow-ties."
I mean...when I first saw this movie, I didn't wanna see it, there was nothing else on t.v., constantly zapped out of this prehistoric black&white film, tennis on 2nd channel, rubbish on Tele-5, so I finally landed on this "AhÃ­ estÃ¡ el Detalle" again, it was just beginning...I had a laugh, then one more, laughs got into outbursts of uncontrollable laughter, decided to turn on de VCR and recorded it almost wholly, I had to see it three times to get it all in (Mr. Mario Moreno talks so fast you have to listen twice) .It's the only one I liked by Cantinflas but the best comic movie I've ever seen in my life.
This goes even further than the original "The Sheik" (1921) ********* in establishing the films as something incompatible with reality; of course, both films suffer when taken without a grain of sand.
The cinematography is impressive, and I particularly liked very much the sequences when Vilma Banky dances in Touggourt beginning with a close and opening to the whole place, and when Ahmed chases Ghobah and Yasmin in the desert.
Rudolph Valentino is fantastic in the role of the son of the Sheik, and his agility recalled me Errol Flynn, when he fights in the bar of Touggourt, jumping on the chandelier.
And.....Janet Leigh with those torpedo breasts that were so typical of that time when whatever women were supposed to be girded up in.
Some is even rather dumb (such as when Janet Leigh confronts Valiant at the 50 minute mark).
(There is even a scene where Val remains mum when King Arthur asks of the whereabouts of Val's Father, the deposed King of Thule, a Kingdom in modern day Norway.)
LYC leaves you laughing, cringing and leaves me even know with a lump in my throat and shivers down my spine when watching the final of the last episode.
Otherwise, here's to the day when the movie Megalodon becomes extinct.
Check that half ass piece of shark at the end when it exploded and sank to the bottom.
Suppose not while sharks are more and more like teddybears when you watch discovery channel.
from the beginning you can tell who lives and who dies, and when it stars to get interesting it ends!
The best part for me was when the half shark body floated across the screen.
The only real one is when the workers pull a prehistoric fish out of a suction hose and it attacks a rig worker a la "Leviathan."
But, even CGI has its limits and you'll see that when the megalodon appears and attacks.
And for some reason the voices of the characters were not always in sync with the film and most of the actors had slight Mexican accents even when they were not Mexican.
So when i say that this film is horrible, i mean it.
However, what they didn't include in this movie (which in my opinion the first war of the worlds used better technology and special effects) was good actors, a good script, emotion, half the time it looked like the lady was smiling when she was obviously supposed to be doing the opposite.
The computer graphics did nothing for the film and the producer really didn't think it through, i mean the scale of the shark was just ridiculous and most of the film was in computer graphics i think in total there was bout half an hour that wasn't done by computer.You could only just tell the shark was swimming in the water and it kept blinking while it was "swimming" so since when did fish start to blink, and it was poorly made, i mean come on its the 21st century all the technology there is these days the director and the producer could have made it much better that even the shark in jaws looked more real then the Megolodon did!
There's only one fairly decent attack-scene when he bursts through the ice.
It was when they showed that smaller dinosaur-fish with the sharp teeth.
One of the favourite scenes is when David (Peter Dalle), after one of many quarrels with Marie (Lena Endre), smashes the TV-set he just bought in the street and then gets arrested by the police.
Originally a professional dancer, when Cagney went into acting, his original aspiration was the 'legitimate stage,' i.e.
James Cagney had an affinity for nostalgic type stories and if The Time of Your Life is a contemporary piece for 1939 when it made its Broadway debut, it has a nostalgic feel to it.
True enough, but I believe that author William Saroyan had a specific political target in mind in 1939 in Congressman Martin Dies who headed the House Un-American Activities Committee when it was created in the late Thirties.
Cagney is remarkably subdued - look at the scene when he examines the little wind-up toys he has Wayne Morris buy for him.
William Bendix does his usual great job, especially when confronting Blick as a potential blackmailing scum.
( Interestlingly someone commented that they were suprised that this movie wasn't blacklisted, Draper ( according tot he IMDB bio) was "was an international star in the 1930's and 1940's" who's "career effectively succumbed to the anti- Communist hysteria that existed in the U.S. after World War II, when he was blacklisted out of the entertainment industry as a Communist sympathizer."
To witness the final stages of Brundlefly is particularly disturbing and Geena Davis' reactions mirror exactly how I felt when watching with disbelief.
The plot of the original movie was kept at its core, a brilliant scientist, Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum), creates a teleporting machine, but when he experiments teleporting himself, something goes wrong and he gets combined with a fly.
Then when he points the gun to his head and begs for death I suddenly realised the second time watching it the true pain both Physically and mentally he went through.
I watched it when it was first televised in 1993 and watched at all again recently.
A real shame because when you watch this movie it becomes obvious that the talent is definitely there.
Effectiveness aside, however, I believe that the mark of exceptional horror is when the question stems from a concern for the characters' wellbeing, and not your own.
This is why it is genuinely moving, instead of tacky, when Goldblum resigns to Davis with a regretful and yet matter-of-fact air that "(he is) an insect who dreamt (he) was a man, and loved it.
We also get to see undoubtedly Jeff Goldblum's best performance playing Seth Brundle in not a too dissimilar way that Tom Baker played The Doctor in DOCTOR WHO though it's fairly obvious that when Brundle does gymnastics it's a body double since the camera never focuses on Brundle's face .
Seems silly, and it is, but it works, and adds the right touch to the storyline, reflecting all those times when you wish life was a musical.
Generally flies are the most useless & annoying animals especially when they sit on your food but for once they did become useful for the idea of this terrific film.
Only it has not been perfected to where it can transfer a living creature and Seth offers Veronica or he calls her Ronnie, to stay with him and film what will happen when he perfects it.
But now Seth has a bigger problem, he's now loosing his body parts and collecting the "Seth Brendel Museum", he is grossly disfigured when he begs Ronnie to come back into his life and help him.
She wants an abortion, but when Seth secretly finds out, he's hurt that she'd want to kill the child and he decides the only cure for him is if he and she(with the baby inside her) get in the telepods together and form the ultimate family of one person!
The scene when Seth Brundle went smashing threw the abortion clinic window and then trying to convince Veronica (Geena Davis) not to abort his unborn baby as the baby was the only thing left of the real him, I thought was very sad and moving for Jeff Goldblums acting was so real and professional in that scene, I honestly don't think that any other actor could have played the role of Seth Brundle better than him.
Journalist Davis, with whom he has a romantic adventure, closely observes the progress of his work but when he teapot's himself through space, the catastrophe happens.
I remeber seeing this film for the first time when I was five years old and telling my friends about the gore scenes but as I got older and viewed the film again I realzied how much of a tragic love story the film was.
Flynn also turns out, not surprisingly when one thinks about it, to be a physical comedian on par with (I sh*t you not) Cary Grant.
Some folks might not have cared for all the phone conversations, but one in particular (here be spoilers) when Flynn has to make two dates for the same night without them overlapping is hysterical.
Somehow when Frank Capra used him Connolly was treated with more respect than in the other films.
As the relationship between Loy, Powell, Tracy, and Harlow in LIBELED LADY got "twisty" (to say the least), in this film a similar growth of jealousy and confusion renders relations between Flynn, Russell, de Haviland, and Knowles equally confusing at the end - especially when all four end up at Justice of the Peace Hugh Herbert's to get married.
I saw this movie when I was a teenager and totally dedicated to being scared by most horror films I saw.
The man in charge, a Greek general (well played by Boris Karloff) takes over when he suspects the possibility of passing the illness to his troops on the mainland.
The concept is kept quite simple but it works out effective, when a small group needs to remain in quarantine on an island, when a mysterious deadly plague suddenly sets in.
The movie is a moody portrayal of what people can do to each other when they are frightened.
Several people gather on Greek Island during the Balkan Wars when a type of plague strikes and folks die one by one.
We often hear of great moments in 1942's 'Cat People'; most specifically the swimming pool sequence and an almost heart stopping moment involving a scary walk and a bus or we may further be reminded of great scenes of psychological terror in Lewton's other movies, notably 'I walked With a Zombie'(1943) and 'The Body Snatcher' (1945), but we seldom hear of the sense of impending doom and escalating terror evoked during 'Isle of the Dead' which comes to head when we realise that one of the primary characters has been buried alive and it's her consequent insanity blended perfectly with an eruption of repressed superstition that chills the viewer in the final fifteen or so minutes.
This one starts off as a war movie, then moves to what appears as a horror film when they land on the island (an island cemetery - not too hard to imagine for Greece).
A small group of people quarantine themselves on a small Greek island when they discover that one of them has the plague.
Boris Karloff stars as a Greek general who becomes cruel when trying to keep order.
It currently has a rating of 6.4 and when I saw that I was stunned to say the very least.
But when that core begins to fail, he is influenced by superstition, folklore and hysteria ... and acts accordingly.
He is so wedded to finding rational solutions that when confronted with their failure, paradoxically, he decides that the rational solution must be supernatural agents at work.
This movie gave me nightmares when I was little!
This is definitely one of my favorite things of all time to watch--what does it for me, though, is the style and synchronization of the various 50's pop songs that are deliciously sprinkled throughout the movie---simply fantastic-----they blend well with the story and its characters and you are always pleasantly surprised when a new song just pops out of someone's mouth at the (sometimes) most inopportune time.
This movie isn't worth renting, I rented it when it first came out on DVD what a waste of 4.50 this movie is someones idea of a sick joke.
Picture starting to watch a movie have way in, because thats what it feels like when you start watching this, They don't explain a god dam thing.
However, it just goes to show what sloppy direction can lead when the concept of creation comes into effect.
I guess I am one of the few who got to see this film, considering I was the only one in the theater when I watched it.
I watched this show when it was first released on television, more than ten years ago, and loved it, and after a recent viewing, found the show had not lost any of it's edge!
A previous comment said something to the effect of an observation that cliches riddle certain parts, but I think it's important to note that this was written in the 1920s, when perhaps those cliches were not quite so pervasive.
If her mother was that bothered, why did she never get suspicious when Jack Friar (S L J) never returned???
And i liked it even more, because i had meet up with the same type of girls when i was in the basketball team, and i also got my ankle injured because of the same reason, trying so hard to be in the front, but thats what happens when you get that attitude.
I guess it is the only way to get the message out to people about when it is on.
Since when did Gaza look like Arizona!?
The heights of lunacy are reached in the last third when one ludicrous plot-twist trips over the next.
Powell demands that Gable get a death sentence, and Gable doesn't even get that upset; he becomes relaxed when Powell apologizes for having to be so rough in the court-room!
And when Loy tells him that Gable killed to help Powell's career, the latter decides that that makes it even more wrong to pardon him!
William Powell, less than month before his first appearance as wealthy gumshoe Nick Charles in "The Thin Man," is the uncorruptible Manhattan DA who saved Gable's life when they were kids.
For example, James Cagney's Rocky Sullivan and Pat O'Brien's virtuous priest were separated by a matter of metres when the former is condemned to a life of crime.
Even when old friend Jim Wade dramatically demands his execution, Blackie looks on with a detached, amused smirk, doodling idly from the defendant's chair; the expected outburst of emotion never arrives.
Two boys of very different backgrounds are orphaned when a pleasure steamer catches fire and sinks in the Hudson River near New York in 1902.
What is so especially fascinating about this film is that Myrna Loy and Clark Gable do not 'click' at all, and glaze over when they look at one another, despite their best acting efforts to simulate at least some flickers of passion.
After all, he was married to Carole Lombard and then was about to marry Jean Harlow when she died tragically.
There is some cheese and then there's some ham (in fact there is no shortage of ham in this film) and then there's some chicken when certain persons lose their courage and then there's some lettuce to brighten and pretty things up a bit, and then there's the daily bread, it's all there.
But it was when my friend gave me this film that I was forced to rethink my existance.
I was 9 years old when this piece of crap was released at the theaters in Sweden.
I have a VHS copy from the U.S. that I got in 1989 when I was 3 years old.
I have seen it when I was just a teenager and now I have found it again.
I saw this movie first in the early 90's when I was a kid and watched it again yesterday, 10+ years later.
I first saw this film when my mother bought it on VHS in a store...
As the film literally drags on, with the constant pounding of the girls miseries it gets to the point where when he gets into a fight, or gets stabbed, which as it turns out he does, you smile and think to yourself "Finally it ends!
Even when there is action, you never get a feeling of hurrying, there is always an element of space in time, giving place to both a story and the people part of it.
-- when the story decides it wants to take us, the hapless viewers, into a Different Place and reveal what it's really trying to tell us all along: that Love can actually flourish with the person who's been responsible for your debasement.
And finally, the central characters silence I believe hamstrings the movie, unlike in a Kevin Smith movie where when Silent Bob speaks, actually has something profound to say.
There is that moment in the film when the main actress finally allows herself to be led -- astray.
Which I didn't notice until the 3rd time in a row when I had first watched the film.
That timeless moment of indecision - when the move to rescue becomes more dangerous than doing nothing at all.
What's more interesting is that, 'that' very the lead actor doesn't say a single word for at least 90mins if I recall correctly, and when he does, he sounds like a six year old boy.
The lives of these people even when violent or mundane and self destructive are very easy to comprehend.It is the first film I have seen by this director and it will definitely not be the last.
The plot is not really important here, and people that cling to whatever feminist or political agendas when discussing a movie are wasting everybody's time.
It reminds me of an old Italian movie, I can't remember the name or actors because I've seen it when I was a kid, with a mafia boss that falls in love with a woman, kidnaps her but wants to charms her, rather that rape her.
The answer comes later in the film when we do hear him speak for the first time.
Director Ki-duk Kim's message seems to be that animal passion will win out in the end, and that humans are, despite the facades they put on, just animals doing animal-like things in the human jungle, and deliverance comes only when one realizes his or her nature and gives into it.
The film explores some of the same territory as the work of Catherine Breillat, but the context seems uneasily different when I'm the only woman in the theater and the director is male, perhaps because the central woman is always an object, even as she pitifully adapts to her various degradations, and even resists being freed from them.
This is not an 'easy' film, in that it does not hand feed the viewer, there are no 'Jaws' style music queues to let you know when to be scared.
One thing that is very annoying though is that when i rented it today the cover said "1:a pÃ¥ biotoppen" (number one at the boxoffice (which almost maid me NOT rent it)) which is funny as the movie has only 86 votes here.
All that would change drastically in 1998,when CBS stopped airing these classic "Peanuts" specials along with the rest of the entire Charlie Brown stuff.
This phase took place after the untimely death of one of the greatest animators of all time when Charles M. Schultz,the creative force behind Charlie Brown and the rest of the Peanuts gang,passed away.
I remember seeing this special for the first time back in the early 1970's,when I was small,but today I get a kick out of enjoying every minute of it when it comes on.
But the funniest and probably the hilarious part is when the Thanksgiving dinner is not about turkey and mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce,but turns out to be buttered toast,popcorn and cold cereal---junk food!
This is when Peppermint Patty goes off on Charlie Brown and his guests about the service of the dinner which was supposed to be about Thanksgiving and not junk food!
This is when his faithful dog,Snoopy really saves the day.
Chuck is a cluck again, but Snoppy and Woodstock save the day - and Thanksgiving - when they prepare a beautiful gourmet meal.... for a beagle and a birdie, that is.
Anyway, I was hugely amused when I heard that there was a boycott organized against this film by some people who thought it was going to be about someone shooting at fish (bang, bang).
I also liked the scene near the end when the kids are in the car and they sing "Over the River and Through the Woods" en route to the Brown's Grandma's condo for a real Thanksgiving dinner.
I remember seeing "A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving" back in the 80s when I was just a child.
Since I saw this when I was a kid I must say I was scared of the last portion of this presentation, the part where Charlie Brown camps out of a house.
The film had it's moments which were mostly good comedy and some romance(or maybe that's just me being attracted to beautiful women), but overall the film was drawn out, the story was too difficult to comprehend, and I can endure long silences with no action or movement, but only when there is a purpose, and in this film I saw no purpose and lost interest through the film a few times.
Musa was one of these films that is so absorbing that after two hours when the film had ended, it seemed like on an hour and a half.
There is always a question when you watch any film from a different culture as to how well it will communicate its themes, an issue particularly associated with Japanese films, fairly or not.
This is compounded when it comes to comedies, which are notorious for travelling badly.
Killers - I got pretty surprised when I ran into "Big Chris"!
Really laugh with the way she laughs and with the wild winking when she's having her "afflati".
who cares when you have plot lines which includes a dysfunctional couple (played to the extreme), repressed homosexuality which blossoms at the end, amazing soundtrack (even the cake song was relevant), a man who is mentally a bird due to hypnotism gone wrong, later taught by his his son to fly due to the son's admiration of his father, Vinnie Jones !?
Even when you watching this film a second time you still might get lost in figuring out all these details.
well, you'll get it when you see it) Even the slower and moderate background music (simple piano chords), which was used in the middle of the film for quite a long time, was also a consummate choice.
Why when the man wants to kill his wife, he can never succeed, but as soon as he retracts the intention, she is really dead?
Why when the same wife cooks a full meal for the man, he is not pleased, but at the end he is happy to accept a less full meal from her?
Later, when she adjusts the food to his liking, both he and she are more satisfied.
However when he finally has no intention of killing her any more, she is taken from him forever.
At one point, he tries to send Dink to his mother's in a heartwrenching scene; when Dink tearfully refuses to go, Champ slaps him through the bars of his cell.
That's why it's so heartbreaking at the end when that union is broken forever and both Dink and we in the audience must come to terms with it and look forward to the future.
Jackie Cooper was the top child actor at MGM in the early 30s when it was the top studio.
Andy "The Champ" has always promised Dink a race horse and when his luck changes, he buys "Lil' Champ" - an old and beat up horse that they train up for a race.
(Even though Linda seems lovely - her character is portrayed as once having been a gold-digger who only married Andy when he was rich and famous and left him for a more prosperous gentleman when he was down on his luck).
Dink hangs out in pool halls with his Dad, isn't enrolled in school, and sits up nights alone in their dingy room waiting for the Champ to come home when he is out on a drinking binge.
However, when he gets a hold of a good sum of money and gambles it away and winds up in the drunk tank overnight he decides that maybe it is for the best if Dink goes with Linda.
He is heart-rending when the Champ tells him he doesn't want him around any more, that he's tired of feeding him, just so he'll go with his mother.
Vidor excelled at coaxing naturalism from his players at a time when theatrical hamming was the par.
He plays a genuine child when with Beery, but when he is around others he deepens his voice and adopts mannerisms as if trying to be an adult.
On the screen he played these lovable oaf types, even when he was a bad guy.
She feels finally at peace with her life when she finally feels she has found her goal in life...changing people's lives for the better.
Humanity...Just think about that.Have we all forgotten the sense of this word?In a world that depresses us into our little caves,in a period when no-one is safe and sure about the intentions of his/hers neighbour ,thoughts about giving LOVE and HAPPINESS to the people surrounding you,me,everyone are really really precious.
I've always thought that if Amelie would have been an Hollywood movie, everyone would have said "It too sappy", but now when it is in french: "Aaah...it's so nice."
Her mother dies in a weird accident and when the shy and daydreamer AmÃ©lie Poulain (Audrey Tautou) becomes a young woman, she moves to central Paris and works as waitress in the cafÃ© Deux Moulins in Montmartre.
He seeks out the man and when she witnesses his happiness, she decides to become the "godmother of the rejected", anonymously helping people that are her acquaintances using her fantasy and little tricks.
This is a delightful romance even when you watch it for the second time, My vote is nine.
so she decides to return it to him, and when the boy whose now a man finds it he's so grateful that he begins to cry.
The movie-going public wants to be inspired and wants to be provided with the same imagination they have when reading a great novel.
Yes it is heart warming, but not in the phony Wal-Mart commercial sense; but in the sense of how good you feel when laughing with a dear, dear friend.
I rather enjoyed watching "Shooting Fish" on a hot, humid summer night, when there was nothing better to do than rent a video.
There are moments when she finds complete and total joy just walking down the street.
Some of it is hilarious, too..like when her pet goldfish habitually tries to commit suicide, or when she is on the telephone with the man at the porno shop, or when a character is asked "Are you a congenital shmuck"?
To start off with, I heard a lot of good things about this movie when it was on the big screens but never got around to see it before it disappeared.
She just happens to fall in love one day when she decides to embark on a quest.
Here the cinematography, acting, and even clothing looks very early 90's and that could be labeled as a negative point but when the story starts to develop and some of the sex sequences get steamier, you can truly find yourself enjoying it good time.
That scene is when Madeleine is being conducted to court in a carriage accompanied by a police officer with the mob getting out of control outside.
I wonder if Lean borrowed on the ideas from this film when making his last.
Featuring the glacial blonde Ann Todd(then Mrs. David Lean) as the real-life accused murderess Madeleine Smith, the film skillfully portrays the travail a foolish and willful young woman goes through when she follows her heart instead of her head and gets ensnared in a sticky situation.
But the ambiguity throughout the film of whether Madeleine actually did the deed and put paid to her paramour is maintained even up to the end when Madeleine gives her leprous Madonna half-smile which could indicate either guilt or innocence, leaving it up for the viewing audience to decide on their own.
Why would she let the young shop clerk and her maid both witness her buying arsenic, when it would have been much more clever of the woman to procure the poison by less public means?
She was twenty when she took up with L'Anglier and 22 when she broke it off.
Lean was at his best when he could go all out on the emotional drama, but this foray into the courtroom is simply not enough of one thing or the other to be a really strong picture.
Delta Force 3 is your typical mindless action fest that you usually get stuck watching at 3:00 am on HBO when you can't seem to sleep and there's nothing on regular tv but news, infomercials and endless loops of Sportscenter.
The most ludicrous moment occurs when Moore dresses up as Cab Calloway and sings 'Minnie the Moocher' with bowdlerised lyrics.
His surprise when he first sees the couple in an embrace, and his look of both great disdain and knowing when he later sees the prince flirting with a servant girl says it all.
There are other well composed moments, most memorably when she is on her balcony at the palace at right of screen in a shaft of light - the shadow of the prince in the doorway is cast upon her and the camera slowly dollies in with the Prince entering the frame from left when he and the camera are upon her.
However, when given the right role, as in Frank Capra's THE BITTER TEA OF GENERAL YEN (1933), Asther was able to exhibit the natural talent he was seldom called upon to use.
While they exude passion & sensuality, he revels in the simpler virtues - duty, dignity, and, when he finally catches on to the Prince's depredations, righteous wrath.
Trevor Morgan was not yet 20 when he did this film,he too is a troubled teen who is befriended by Nick Nolte after he does a bit of vandalism to Nolte's house.
This is especially true when you consider the climax of the movie which is left a little wanting because of this lack of relationship.
Still, it is Mitchum's movie, and he is as compelling when he takes his priestly role seriously as when he plays the usual disengaged but competent existentialist who expects nothin' from nobody.
I know one of the actresses in this film but I don't think I'm biased because I've told her when she doesn't pick the greatest projects lol.I saw this at the DGA theater in NY and I'll be completely candid about what works and what doesn't work in this movie.
Prepared for the horror equivalent of a Brecht play: it will transform the audience and expectations about what the genre can do when it is permitted to move beyond its creaky conventions.
But, the suspense is quickly ruined for it when you realized there is absolutely NO mystery at all throughout the entire film.
I am truly not exaggerating when I say that.
It is the anticipation of knowing what's going to happen but not knowing exactly where and when.
It definitely builds because when it gets to the point where there's only the one boy left, and he's hiding from her in the library, I was literally hiding under my seat.
True, she's a loon, but not a mindless one, and when she flirts with Morwick and looks into his handsome face, you just know there's a part of her that wants to date this guy, not decapitate him.
It's a great movie to pop in when you just want to relax and laugh.
I remember when this movie first came out, it only lasted two weeks and it was directly sent to the dollar movies like a bullet.
Many do not keep in mind that beauty and acting skills are two totally different things that should not be confused when choosing a great actor.
I love this movie so much, and I laughed just as much when I'd seen it three times as after the first.
Everything explodes into a funny romantic, twisting and turning storyline when the 3 woman decide to teach their Chasing Papi a lesson..
I admit that when I first heard of this movie starring Sofi'a , I wanted to see Sofi'a topless or in lace nightgowns..but that changed when I watched this movie..
Somehow all three women end up at his house, when he trys to explain his situation, he falls out under a tranquilizer pill he took before.
Wish I hadn't, because the last time I had such fun time like this one, it's when I went through two endoscopias in a row (it's when a doctor puts in you a camera by the throat to check your stomach from the inside).
And if you can't make those gags work in a five minutes range, then guess what happens when you stretch them way beyond their boundaries.
I don't know why they talk to each other in a foreign language when ALL of them speak spanish.
Whenever I see her on screen, I feel like Jim Carrey in "The Mask" when he was watching Cameron Diaz do that musical number.
is it a problem when a man sleeping with his wife ?
The second character (Azzam) was a shoe polisher in the old days & turned to be a very rich man who has Car agencies & huge stores in Egypt & is searching for another wife to marry for fulfilling his sexual interest but with marriage he thinks that he is on the right track according to religion but when the story goes on it shows us how cruel he was with his new beautiful wife (Somaya El Khashab) & on the other hand he entered the Egyptian assembly with his relations with some government officials.
The movie was great as it represent many true images from Egyptian actual life, and when I was watching the movies I felt many f the movie characters are sitting beside me.
I didn't like Yousra in this movie and I hate her voice when she was singing in French and I felt her too boring this time.
You may not laugh out loud the whole time like you did at "There's Something About Mary" or other slapstick comedies, but you'll definitely be smiling the whole time, and by the time the credits role you'll simply be in a much better mood than you were when you started.
I was surprised when I found out that the younger actors/actresses have matched - and sometimes- exceeded their older and more famous counterparts.
now in the age of 65, he's living a lonely life only to enjoy himself with women and girls of different types, finally he found the true love with Bothayna (Hend Sabry) and suffering from the annoying of his half mad sister Dawlat (Essad Youniss) ..  - Haj Azzam (Nour El Seriff): An old tycoon started from zero, wanted to play a politic role but was lost and surrendered in the middle of corruption that rules the game of politics ..  - Taha (Mohamed Emam): a low level young man failed to achieve his dream to become a police officer, instead he joined a radical cell who doesn't really understood the true meaning of the great religion of Islam and became a terrorist and finally died while trying to kill the police officer who once tortured him when he was captured and jailed ..  - Bothayna (Hend Sabry): a poor girl who was forced to become a whore serving the ugliest kinds of people to have the money to live and finally found Zaki El Dissouki who gave her the power and the true meaning of love and finally married him - Hatem Rasheed (Khaled El Sawy): A great chief editor in the journal d'Egypt magazine who is living his life as a desperate homosexual and trying to find a guy to satisfy his sick needs and tends ..  A strange mix of characters which were perfectly managed by a strong story and a great and promising director (Marawan Hamed) Really a worthy movie to be seen as it reflects a hard criticism to some corrupted situations of politics, sexual lives and terrorism *** Lo'ay
The sweep and size of the film (not to mention its length) may fool people into thinking it's a more important picture than it actually is, when really it's not much more than one big soapy melodrama that manages to stay mostly entertaining over the course of its three hours.
Normally when it comes to voting for movies on the IMDb, I'm quite liberal.
I saw this film when I was vacationing in England.
It is strong wakeup call to those who love their country to stop burying their heads in the sand when it comes to double standards that's affecting everyone in the society making everyone feel inferior to the country.
Director Hamid was 28 when he made it and is the son of the screenwriter who did the adaptation.
The titular Armenian-owned, Twenties Yacoubian Building in the once elegant, restricted central zone of the city "became home to Cairo's rich and powerful when it opened," Lalani writes.
His girlfriend Buthayna leaves him when he becomes religious and eventually she goes to work for Zaki, who's reformed and treats her well.
She stays on board, however, when Dylan convinces her that they are something like modern day Robin Hoods-- that the money they're `raising' is going to orphans.
And Schwartz has good timing and sets a pace that keeps it all moving right along, which, when you add it all up, makes for a satisfying, enjoyable experience.
I was on holiday this year when she appeared at a nearby venue-it broke my heart-I have yet to see her live-but this concert is a wonderful second best!
You might want to have a handful of mood elevators handy when you watch this one.
Later, when the telephone man (Ross Elliott) comes to remove the phone for unpaid bills, Duryea coincidentally receives a telegram reporting that his wife and daughter have had a serious auto accident and are hospitalized in Chicago.
Teaming up Ward Bond and Barton MacLane as corrupt cops comes in stark contrast to their pairing in Bogart's "The Maltese Falcon"; it never took much time for Inspector Weber (Bond) to cave in to Cotter's demands when it meant a bigger and bigger payoff.
I'm a bit apprehensive over the Holiday Carleton character, I actually found her to be somewhat pathetic, particularly when she trades lip locks with Cotter after he slaps her around with a towel.
As mad as he was when he first discovered Cotter/Murphy and his daughter together, I wonder what he would have done if he hadn't caught the newlyweds fully clothed in separate beds.
I wonder though, if an earlier line uttered by an off screen elevator operator was meant to reference Cotter's ultimate fate when he asked - "Going down?"
Whether it was a box-office smash when it released doesn't matter today.
Holiday's relationship with Cotter has an unhealthy dimension as can be seen on a couple of occasions when she responds positively to him following violent incidents.
I'm not one to endorse crooked cops or domestic violence, but when you see these birds in action, you understand why Cagney rules his roost the way he does.VERY underrated,very fast and colorful.
The one obvious opportunity to display any kind of emotion was when she discovered that she had been conned by a trusted friend, but no, an expression of anger seemed to be too difficult, so instead we get nothing.
What you WILL find are four women walking around a hotel naked for most of their screen time, and when they're not WALKING around naked, they're...err...hmmm...ummm...doing other things that people do when they're naked--more often than not, with each other.
He also has a loony gardener, Marleno(Albino Graziani)who likes to pester the girls, when he's not whistling or singing to his beautiful flowers outside the hotel.
It only happens when the girls make the unfortunate mistake of nearing and entering the abbey.
After one hour of walking around naked and making out with each other, one of them disappears when going out to take photos... People who are not in favor of Jess Franco's cinema will probably think of this as the worst film ever made; however, the film's incredible weirdness and lack of any logic whatsoever are also the elements that make it fun (in addition to its primary quality, the constant sleaze and female nudity).
In typical Franco-fashion they are all bisexual nymphomaniacs who thrive for every man, and have non-stop sex with each other when there's no man available.
Personally I prefer it when he leaves out the sex altogether, but even then (as is the case with 'Mansion of the Living Dead') he's so ham fisted in his approach that he generally ruins any element of horror there might've been.
), especially when you consider the movie Franco was rehashing here was 'Tombs of the Blind Dead' - itself a (great) movie which would never have existed had Romero not redefined the zombie, moved it into modern times and made it into what it still is today!
Geoffrey backs him up 100 percent and is the test pilot for Mitchells aircraft.However tragedy is just around the corner when (after working flat out without sleeping or eating)Mitchell feels unwell and consults a Dr who tells him if he does not stop he will die in just a year.Will Mitchell ignore the advice or heed it?well if you read about him you will know if you don't know the story then watch this wonderful film.David and Leslie have a great chemistry and play their parts well a must see film about an important part of British history.
One assumes the part was created to afford a little feminine light relief, since the central character is -- inconveniently for the standard narrative curve -- already happily married as a young man when we first meet him, and omits to look elsewhere... At any rate, Niven-as-narrator is a charming scamp, and refreshingly the plot refrains from taking the obvious path of marrying him off to his 'snapdragon', R.J.Mitchell's formidable secretary Miss Harper.
despite only catching the film halfway through, the time when shannons already been conned, I was luckily able to catch up quickly and thankfully did because this turned out to be a better than average TV movie.
Though it's largely irrelevant I confess to being a little bemused by the large number of posters who think that Leslie Howard was English when he was in fact Hungarian.
His only show of assertiveness is when he informs the haughty bigwigs of 'Supermarine'that he will design aeroplanes HIS way, despite David Horne's salutary warning that he will 'come an almighty cropper'.
One of those unsung heroes was my adored uncle Peter Howard-Williams, who had been in 19 Squadron flying out of Duxford during the Battle of Britain, but happened to be at Ibsley when the station was chosen for the film.
This is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and...
Basically I started not watching, which made events seem even more surreal when I did look up.
all the characters exchange only a few words during the movie, dialogues are nearly absent, and when some words are spoken they're often weak and empty, far away from describing people's real feelings.
i think this film was confusing and had a bad plot.Shannen did OK in this but not as well as she normally does.i found it hard to follow the whole story and found it quite boring and didn't enjoy it till bout half way but i didn't enjoy it much i would say not the best of films i have watched with her in :l what was the point of this story and what was the plot  I've seen Shannen in better in other films i was very disappointed when i finished watching this cause it wasn't what i expected i would I've this film a bad review of 3 out of 10 Shannen is still the best actress in the world and she can act whoever put that comment that she cant she just isn't good in that 1
The book is MUCH better - all of Martin's short stories are just awesome - and I have to admit, I envisioned Michael Praed when I read Royd Eris's adventure, and that probably helped bring on the tears when it reached the end.
deaf actors in the movie world nowadays....   Also, it's a bigger plus when you consider the directional approach chosen for this film -- it's an appreciative success.
i first saw this movie over 5 years ago when i was working at walt Disney world.
They always ask to watch it over and over when I can't be there and they have to have a sub.
It's only when outside factors cause tension that spill over into one or more of her worlds that she has trouble coping!
It's sort of a constraining situation, and when a relative gives Lara the chance to become a musician, her parents try to keep her at home.
It's always good to be able to see such intellectual stories, especially when Hollywood makes so many pointless blow-'em-up movies.
I did not know what to expect when I watched this movie but I can tell you it left me guessing from the beginning to the ending, and the ending was what threw me so , this movie was well done for a made for TV movie.
Of all the songs they did, my favorite was when Olly just got back from Seattle and did that bad-ass punk song about how "HIS SO-CALLED LIFE IS JUST LAIM!!!"
In my opinion, conspiracy theorist start off with an advantage, because while the adherents to the official version of events must PROVE their claims, the conspiracy theorists don't - they succeed when they manage to create enough doubt about the official version of events.
I rate it a 10 by how it affected me when I first saw it on television years ago, probably '78 or '79.
but if you think it's bologna, and you want to check for actual facts like me, then you'll find it has a lot of mistakes in it, which is BIG when it comes to an even like 9/11.
(which is important when it comes to construction of the Twin Towers since they were unlike any other building that they are compared to when they talk about fires in steel buildings) We are only given statements, usually one line from someone, we don't know anything about other than a title, about things they may or may not know about.
The filmmakers also take every news report as gospel truth with a report of the blowing up of one of the towers roofs being portrayed as true when the footage shows its not There is no room for any error in any news footage, its not an error but signs of the conspiracy.
The evidence in one sequence of pictures is forgotten when discussing another so that the evidence of the planes that hit the towers being commercial airlines from some shots is dismissed because its not clear in others.
Frankly I could almost believe its stories, except that none of them make any real sense when you stop to think about them.
I hate when paranoia somehow gets viewed as fact.
The typical Conspiracy theorists, when working on a conspiracy theory, starts with the conclusion, and then works from there, choosing the evidence that can fit the theory and discarding and ignoring all facts and evidence that contradicts the overall theory.
Also all the facts of this film have been debunked: www.911myths.com  The worst part of the film is when Dylan Avery claims that the families of the victims of United 93 didn't talk to the passengers on the plane.
Funny how when tough questions are asked, dumb people come out with sledge hammers.
Don't get angry when your government is questioned.
Neo-clan member Giuliani makes his pal Silverstein an offer he can't refuse - sacrifice two asbestos-riddled, low rent behemoths in exchange for millions in insurance money, and a bonus to be determined later (when Rudy becomes President?)
You know when your parents told you not to trust anyone?
Conspiracy theorists, when they are making their conspiracy theory, starts with the conclusion and then works his or her way from there.
I think the funniest (and perhaps pathetic) moment of loose change is when it shows footage of the second plane hitting the second tower.
How can anyone possibly believe this crap when i would take you 15 minutes and an internet connection to find out that more or less every single claim is simply not true.
It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands.
Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910.
It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication.
The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him.
Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne's stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished).
You could speak in air-planes back then, the problem was that the calls was cut-off, when the plane went away from a transmitter on the ground.
Right back when no one knew anything of what was going on.
Obviously, EVERYTHING should be taken loosely, especially when it comes to events as sensitive as 9/11 -- but I am shocked at how many people are choosing to not even question one ounce of what happened that particular day.
When it does cite legitimate news providers, the stories are almost always from the immediate aftermath of the attacks - a confusing time when even the media organisations themselves admit they made a terrible mess of the reporting.
I always love it when a few angry wanna be filmmakers jump on IMDb and critique other people's work.
Sure, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but when you COMPLETELY MISS THE JOKE, the joke is actually on YOU.
I guess I'm not a serious horror fan, but I do know when something is just plain, old entertaining.
Meghan Ory steals the show as a potential girlfriend for Corey Sevier's protagonist, but when she is not in the frame, the weakness of the rest of the cast shines through like a desk lamp before the face.
Granted, I am not familiar with Canada in any sense, but surely they must have days when one does not require an ice pick to breathe out.
By sheer dumb luck Douglas is not at the lighthouse when this happens, but he becomes a hunted man by Brynner and his pirate crew who want to set up headquarters there and use the light to pile up as many wrecks as they can plunder.
I did like this film very much both when first seeing it in the theater and now on VHS.
The aliens were very obviously total skanks, and i didn't feel sorry at all for them when they were killed.
Obviously no-one believes Luke but when Bobby Johnson (Mark Trottier) is found dead under mysterious circumstances Luke is convinced the alien babes are behind it & since he is blamed for Bobby's murder after having a fight with him earlier in the evening Luke has even more reason to expose the alien menace on campus....
Are these guy's so pathetic that when a total blonde babe goes down on them to suck their manhood they make silly faces & come up with excuses why the total blonde babe should stop.
The aliens when revealed are nothing special in themselves & look rather dark & drab & to save on the budget very humanoid in shape.
If it did then Decoys is even more of a disappointment when the amount of money the makers had to play with is taken into consideration.
You can imagine what the executives at the Sci-Fi channel were thinking when the pitch for this film was given.
I'm not gonna spoil it for you just in case you haven't seen this but keep an eye out for it when you do!
The room is empty, and he sneaks around, when the two girls arrive.
Enter our virgin nerd and his ability to resist the naked charms of the aliens (even when he thinks they are normal).
Plus they sprout icky tentacles when aroused and don't have navels.
What do you do when someone's your fave actress?
Actually, when the movie was over I completely hated her.
There were times when it seemed like scenes had been cut because things didn't make sense, but it wasn't too hard to ignore that and fill in the blanks ourselves.
One last thing I find Jessica Lange, who I think is a very good actress always uses cigarettes as a prop when she is playing sassy or devious women, she does it here.
It started off quite promisingly, well actually the wheels didn't start coming off until burglary/attack on Paltrow when it was blatantly and painfully obvious that the mother had arranged this.
Also if my mother-in-law had treated me like that when I was in labour and then tried to kill me with a lethal injection I would not have stayed in the house even for a dramatic denouement the next morning.
But my hopes were soon dashed when the little Nazi boy (Emil) comes to live with them.
Also, you'd think when he went to school and began spreading hate and Nazi propaganda that the school would have taken more notice.
BUT, after 1001 warning signs AND when he then tries to kill two people (by beating one with a fireplace poker and then trying to stab another), you'd think the kid would have been deported or arrested or even shot!
Fox, a nephew he actually liked when he was a kid.
That fact that Emil's dad who was thrown into a Nazi concentration camp where he eventually died for speaking out against the Fuhrer, Adolph Hitler, made Emil look suspicious to his Nazi overseers who felt that he may well become like his dad, normal, when he grows up.
Not getting the hint that he was a total wash out, in him not having what it takes to be a good Nazi, from his beloved Nazi Germany Emil ,because of him being brainwashed since he could barley walk, still thinks that he's a full fledged Nazi Superman and goes so far as to parade around the house, this in 1944 when the US was at war with Nazi Germany, with his Nazi or Hitler Youth uniform.
Emil goes a bit too far when he first comes to deal with Leona, his Uncle Mike's fiancÃ©e, being Jewish as well as his determination to steal Mike's mail that he gets from the War Department.
In the case of his future aunt Leona the fact that she's Jewish is enough to drive Emil batty in thinking that he'll be forced to live under the same roof as she is when she marries his Uncle Mike: a fate worse then death itself for the cute but somewhat not all there in the head little Nazi.
Emil is stymied in his plan to serve the Fatherland when he's caught red-handed, with his hands in Uncle Mike's drawer, by his young cousin Pattie, Joan Carroll, who just bought him a birthday present, a illuminated watch which he always wanted for his crazy nighttime war maneuvers.
It's a dark, stormy and foggy night when a ship transporting prisoners sinks.
You know you're in for a rough time when a film's opening drops you into a scene that feels like you've somehow already missed 10 minutes.
The end credits roll, but does anyone believe a kid that tried to kill before won't try to do it again when he doesn't get his way?
This had all the gore you need, maybe it could of had more, but still has a bloody edge, and the effects wern't all the terrible, even though towards the end when the woman is being grabbed by her hair when she's hanging off the Lighhouse does look a little bit stupid.
Since I was so bored, I decided to watch anyway(This is the one when the miso tastes funny; in a bad way, so Jang Geum and Han Sang Goong investigates).
This is about the story of Jang Geum, a palace maid who is an orphan, but adopted by Kang Dook Gu and his wife, 'Qiuxiang', I assume (It is later mentioned that when Jang Geum's house was raided by Yin Mojie's men, all letters were taken, and all of them were love letters from Kang Dook Gu to his wife, and the letter always starts with 'Blah blah blah Qiuxiang'.
But when Choi Sang Goong and her gang find out, they try in vain to drive Jang Geum out.
The very first time I first heard of this hit Korean drama here in my country was when it was reported that many in Hong Kong watched the finale and it broke the record in terms of viewership ratings there.
Not hooked but enough interest to keep me going...same with the next one...and then when I finally got to the part when the little Jang Geum became orphaned and out-shone the other little girls in the palace in her determination and diligence, that is when I really got hooked, which brings me to a suggestion ... watch the first 3 episodes in their entirety.
When Emil Bruckner arrives, he immediately makes a blunder when he describes his plane trip seated next to a fat Jew.
Please dont do like i normally do and rent the movie despite the bad review, when i say this movie sucks worse then having a dog p*ss on the leg of your best dress slacks...i mean it!
He is so normal, and so much the secret us, the part of us that "knows" we're doomed to failure and mediocrity, that you can't help rooting for him when he begins to succeed, no matter what the cost.
SIDEBAR: I'm a chick horror fan and get really upset when people point to horror flicks as nothing but misogyny.
As it is, this movie's take on every writer's nightmare when facing creative paralysis cuts a lot deeper than anything Stephen King has managed.
A fun scene i never will forget is when Robin Hoods priest Tuck punch king Richard the Lionheart right in the mouth, not knowing who he is.
A great moment for me was when i in a Dungeuns and dragon game meeting stole Sam Neils Line after i was challenged by another knight.
Consider, for instance, the subtle images at the scene when Ivanhoe visits Lady Rowena at her castle with Wamba (George Innes).
Playing a hero, especially a naÃ¯ve goody-two-shoes one, is probably the most difficult job in show business (just ask anyone who's played Batman) but he solves it very well, and sometimes annoyingly so (when he remains faithful to the beautiful, but dull, Rowena (also well-payed by Anthony, who does the best she can with Rowena).
Everyone knows the film inside out but are still watching it year after year; fills in on every funny line (like when de Boeuf shouts "Striiip him!
Ivanhoe: A nice experience for a romantic fan  This was a TV-movie I liked when I was a child, I still think it is okay, but maybe not a realistic end battle between Brian and Wilfred, and the same with the make up, some of the costumes and hair styles.
I saw it when it was first broadcast--and some of it again when rerun a year or two later.
That Certain Summer is way ahead of it's time for the year 1972.I did not see the movie when it originally aired in 1972.
Well-made TV-movie, largely acknowledged as the first made-for-television film to tackle the subject of homosexuality, has divorced San Francisco contractor Hal Holbrook looking forward to a visit from his fourteen-year-old son who lives out in Los Angeles with his mother; things are shaky when the kid meets his dad's new male friend, and once he figures out that Pop enjoys this male companion more so than eligible women, he runs away in anger and confusion.
Still, when the kid runs away (for a large section of the film), precious time on the clock is wasted as the adults search for him and worry.
Hal Holbrook's son does not know his father is gay when he first comes for his annual summer visit.
One of the most memorable exchanges for me, takes place between Martin Sheen and his sister when she tells him how much she understands his lifestyle.
Granted, Ethan Embry isn't exactly the first name off of a casting director's lips when discussing a potential lead for a huge blockbuster, but his talent surely merits him better work opportunities than this.
As you do, you experience a taste of that "unique rush of excitement" that a real gambler feels when they are up and are winning, but when luck runs out, the finality of what it means to lose hits home and the darker side of gambling emerges.
I don't post many reviews on IMDb as I only post them when I'm am very pleasantly surprised by a movie as I was with this one.
Later, when she discovers her own dead body, her reaction is as wooden as that of a cigar store Indian (or Al Gore, take your pick).
If the movie is so concerned with tangents, than wouldn't they have created one when J.K. started blowing away tons of American minutemen?
And finally, we have the biggest annoyance of all...why did Butt Chin still pull that fast one on J.K. and get poor Matt fired when all he had to do was time-travel back to before he gave the demo and tell his past self to never give it?
Of course, this film can't stand enough to be painfully bad when it;'s being dramatic.
The only moments that don't induce side-splitting laughter are the moments when our be-chinned hero makes an attempt at a joke.
I hear he was 23 when he made this.
I recall my occupation involving the culinary artistry of making and delivering pizzas when I was that age.
The funniest part for me is when the wormy fat guy is in the plane with his evil boss and Crow cracks: "Sir, I'm getting a little worried about lunch, it's almost 12:30" or something like that.
In the end, I cheered when both inventor and businessman died in the Revolutionary war era.
What if, when they returned, everyone had BRITISH accents, including the evil CEO of a now-British conglomerate.
It's almost as if the director, or the producer was making a film simply to have a bunch of friends appear on camera and was afraid to take out very poor scenes when their removal would have strengthened this film.
Maybe it's the cameos from people I love or the pure ballsiness to seemingly not care what people are going to think of the film, like when they gave it such a cheeseball title (probably not expecting people to confuse it with art-house fare like one reviewer did).
But when you watch Zombiegeddon a lot of this disappear or make the film pretty funny.
